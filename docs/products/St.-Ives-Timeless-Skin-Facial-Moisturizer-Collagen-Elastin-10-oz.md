<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Light and creamy! Better than many higher priced products! Would recommend !</li>
    <li> I bought this moisturizer after hearing that Dr. Oz had recommended it, saying that it was the only moisturizer necessary...I assume because of the main ingredient, Collagen Elastin.  I just finished the 10 oz. jar and while it does the job to hydrate my skin at night, I&#x27;m not sure about the long term benefits.  Even though the manufacturer suggests day and night time use, I only use it at night since it doesn&#x27;t have any SPF.</li>
    <li> I Have not had it long so we will see how it works</li>
    <li> Purchased off the reviews but can&#x27;t really tell a difference from this and other face creams, smells nice though</li>
    <li> I was looking for an alternative to a very expensive facial lotion that I had been using. I saw that the rating on this product was very high and I have used some St. Ives products before (apricot scrub, body lotion) and they were fine. This product however is horrible-- I put it on the first day and I like the way it applied and absorbed. The second day was fine, too. The third day, however, I noticed the skin on my nose burned terribly when I applied the lotion. I was somewhat alarmed but the burning subsided and I forgot about it until that evening. I washed my face and the skin on my nose was rough, dry, and scaly. (I had this happen once before when I used a retinol product). I definitely have sensitive skin. Maybe if you don&#x27;t, this product will be fine for you, but if you have any kind of sensitive skin avoid this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to something in this product which sucks because it really does tighten things up.</li>
    <li> Wonderful moisturizer, Inexpensive and most importantly for me, cruelty free. I alternate it with a higher-end moisturizer for my aging skin. Nice scent, medium texture.</li>
    <li> I am not one to exaggerate, but I must say I love the St. Ives Timeless Skin Collagen Elastin facial moisturiser. The texture of the moisturizer is almost but not quite like a cream. I use daily and have noticed that my skin appears to be more even tone, slight reduction in fine lines. The most significant difference is the noticeably healthy glow that I now have. My skin does not look greasy at all, it looks dewy and fresh. The best part? I will be 50 years old in a few months!! Go St Ives!</li>
    <li> I really like this cream.  It&#x27;s very light and not greasy.  I use it every morning under the makeup and at night after showering.  It makes my face very soft and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  One jar lasts a long time....</li>
    <li> creamy and light moisturizer. You can use it on face and body. Very light on the skin. St Ives is a good value</li>
    <li> This lotion does a great job at keeping my skin looking in good condition! The product lasts forever as well. I bought the smaller jar and I still have plenty. I love that it does not have a strong smell and it doesn&#x27;t make my face breakout. I have sensitive skin and some lotions can even cause my eyes to burn but this lotion does neither of those things. The only downside, is that its a little too thick for summer. I used it throughout winter and it did an amazing job but in the summer it gets a little sticky. I still use it as a night time cream but I have switched to a lighter cream for the day. I will stick with this product though as it is a such a great price and great product!</li>
    <li> Love it! Causes no irritation good for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this at Walmart instead of Amazon. I might have paid maybe around 3 or 4 dollars for this TEN OUNCE jar. It&#x27;s a lot of moisturizer, but it works fantastically. I am a serious skin care product junkie. My boyfriend likes to joke that if someone told me monkey poop would give me beautiful skin I&#x27;d be the first one in line to buy a tube. Curiously there have been no such studies. But St. Ives really outdid themselves with this one.    I&#x27;m young, but I am a smoker...Terrible, even worse, because I know better. I started noticing deep lines forming down each sides of my face kind of between my nose and cheeks which I decided had to be because of this awful habit. Straight away I was on a mission to find some \\&quot;cure\\&quot; even after years of experimenting and using different skin care products and tools including vitamin E oil, hyaluronic acid, massage therapy, chemical peels, masks, face brushes, electronic face brushes, netted washclothes, etc. Now, I really liked the St. Ives Apricot scrub, but when I compared it to the cheaper Queen Helene version I was smitten. Having never tried any other St. Ives product, strangely, I shrugged off the entire line and figured it was just another dime a dozen commercial company with a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; gimmick. Now I see that I was missing out all this time on at least one of their gems, because I use this moisturizer every day faithfully and those lines have disappeared by 98%, not to mention my skin always looks hydrated, not greasy, oily, shiny or superficially moisturized at all. My skin texture appearance continues to improve with every use to the point that I always receive unsolicited compliments and I use foundation much more sparingly. This moisturizer really is very special... it just sinks into the skin and imparts the kind of suppleness we take for granted as children and then long for in adulthood.    The smell is fresh and light.I even use it on my body sometimes! The formula is non-comedogenic, which is essential to someone like me with oily/combination skin type. The jar itself, while I anticipate battle cries among the nitpickers about hygiene risks, is extremely economical and will last forever. I could go on and on, but all anyone reading this needs to know is: PURCHASE IMMEDIATELY! I mean, come on ...the sheer number of reviews on this website alone should speak volumes!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate it at all.  It feels so nice on my face and neck, I put it on morning and night.  The cream  is not oily , but very light and refreshing.  The jar size is huge and the price is perfect.  Have never seen this product in stores so thanks amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Was a very good purchase, I&#x27;ll buy it again when I need it, I loved the size of the packing</li>
    <li> I have always opted for produts like Estee Lauder, and Lancome. I saw an article about the contents of this product as this is what the skin craves and you don&#x27;t have to pay a fortune like other facial products.. According to this article I would see a much noticeable improvement in days. I have to say I could not believe the size of this product, it is huge for the price. I am still in the trial basis. So far I have noticed how dry and itchy it is making my skin feel, and not what I expected at all.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because it was on an episode of Dr Oz. I don&#x27;t care for this brand at all I don&#x27;t know why I thought this one would be any different for my preferences. Then I thought I could use it on my legs to not waste it, and it never happened. Its sitting under the bathroom sink in the back.</li>
    <li> I like that this is not greasy and you can&#x27;t even tell you are wearing a moisturizer.  But I do prefer to use it during the day in the spring and fall.  In the winter I use a heavier creme and in the summer I use something with sun block.  But I do use this all year long at night time.</li>
    <li> I love to use this product everyday before going to bed. I bought 2 more for my mother. Hope that it work for her skin too!</li>
    <li> Loves the smell of this cream.  Very good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> After just a week, I could really see &amp; feel the difference in my skin. It doesn&#x27;t take very much of this to put on your face &amp; neck. Not only is it a great product but it&#x27;s also a great value. My skin even felt denser, not thin like older skin. I will continue to use this product. I have tried much more expensive lotions &amp; they were nowhere as beneficial as this!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with St. Ives Timeless Skin moisturizer.  I have been using this product on and off for about three years now, and it is still just as effective as the first time I used it (which is amazing, since my skin seems to grow resistant to some more expensive moisturizers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the lack of SPF I use this moisturizer exclusively as a night time lotion.  I layer it on very thick before bed, and in the morning my face feels soft, fresh, and looks pretty darn good.  I love that even though this moisturizer is very, very light, it does not manage to leak into my eyes.  It stays PUT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, a jar lasts almost a year - for under $5 the value just can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use as a body lotion.  It works great.  It is not greasy, but moisturizes deeply and is a better cost per ounce than something like Aveeno&#x27;s Whipped Body moisturizer in a jar.  Try it on your legs.  Works super well!</li>
    <li> I feel smooth skin after using the product. the bottle is huge while the price is no as high as expected. so this is really a good product</li>
    <li> Clean, moisturizing, but not heavy or greasy.  Does not leave any residue, and soaks in perfectly - leaves you soft, but no film or grease.  Mild smell is pleasant, and I can use from hands to arms, to face and neck.  Love this cream, and will continue to use it as an all over body lotion.</li>
    <li> Got fried at the pool, only had this laying around, and it made my sunburn feel better the next morning.  Not sure if this is related, just thought i should share, smell is quite strong though, especially for a dude</li>
    <li> This is non greasy, light, and absorbs quickly. Fragrance free.  I am fair skinned and very sensitive, and this product is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> my mom is 57 yrs old and she has been using this product less then a week, and he skin glows its soft fine lines are disapearing tighter firmer skin!!! A+++++++++</li>
    <li> Works well on my skin. I don&#x27;t know why it works and how but I find it very effective. Du to sudden change in weather, my skin gets easily dried so thanks to this they&#x27;re not anymore.</li>
    <li> I love it, this moisturizer is light and great! I can use it anytime and it won&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I bought this as a go to to simply moisturize because I use a wrinkle cream and Jergens natural glow.  I didnt feel like my face was hydrated enough.  And of course Dr. Oz recommended it lol.  The bottle is huge for the price and it stays all day.  I dont feel like it does alot other then moisturize however so I now use it for my decolletage.  if it had sunscreen I would give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin I won&#x27;t use this product. It made my face and neck breakout into a rash that was very painful. I gave it to a friend who had no problems.</li>
    <li> Seriously-- the BEST moisturizer on the market, hands down. And SO cheap! Makes you wonder if its too good to be true-- its good, and its TRUE! I&#x27;m pretty lazy when it comes to facial care, for the last 20 years I would put some Oil of Olay on before makeup cause that&#x27;s what my mom did, but I never took the time to rub it in, get the neck, etc. I bought this stuff one day when I hit 35 because it was clear my face was taking a hit, fine lines, blotchiness and all. It was cheap, it had good reviews...but WOW!!! It makes me want to stand in front of the mirror and rub my face and neck all day, it&#x27;s so wonderful. And within 2 minutes, it&#x27;s like you never put it on, except for feeling the moistury goodness and looking fresh as a daisy. I&#x27;m now considering slathering the stuff all over, cause heck, one can afford to at this price!!!! I also use the tub of St. Ives Apricot scrub on my face in the shower, but the timeless skin lotion is MONEY. The first time in my life I&#x27;ve felt comfortable walking around without makeup!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to see if it would help with the eczema on my face, which is causing very thin wrinkles and dry patches. I have been using it almost daily..in the morning, midday, and at night. In between I am using an Aveeno lotion. Now my skin looks smooth and shiny. The dry patches look better..less dry, but the thin wrinkles remain. Even so, I will continue to use it until it is all used up.</li>
    <li> I have seen a real difference in my skin. I use it as a night cream on my face, it&#x27;s easy to apply and affordable enough to use on neck and chest area as well.</li>
    <li> I like how this smells and feels. It doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out so I think that means it&#x27;s well balanced for my skin type. The container lasts so long! It doesn&#x27;t contain sunscreen so I need to find another lotion that does offer sun protection. But I do like having a non-sunscreen option so I&#x27;ll continue to use and enjoy this. I like the St. Ives brand and I&#x27;ll probably look for more products from them in the future.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this facial moisturizer. My skin absolutely drinks this up! I cannot speak to whether or not it does anything to correct wrinkles (I&#x27;m 27 and in the prevention phase!) :) but - I can say, I will never use anything else on my skin. I use this every-single-day and my skin is smooth, glowing and looks healthy. The product also smells really fresh - without smelling like there have been a lot of perfumes added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells good, feels clean on the skin, does exactly what you want out of a moisturizer - it&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It absorbs right away and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy. I usually have very oily skin but this lotion seems to balance that out. Great price too! I&#x27;m allergic to most fragrances so I&#x27;m always a bit worried when I buy something online before I can smell it but this doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies at all. I&#x27;m going to continue to buy this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> my favorite source of Collagen</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my 92-year-old brother-in-law who, many years go, was a Hollywood make-up artist.  A little goes a long way, but it is a great moisterizer</li>
    <li> I used to be an advocate Olay Complete lotion for years until p&amp;g decided to change the formula for the sensitive skin lotion. As a result I went out on a thorough search to find the perfect facial cream/lotion that won&#x27;t irritate and cause breakouts to my extra sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve tried quite a large number of products with no luck, until I came across this st. Ive&#x27;s facial cream and thought of giving it a try. Needless to say i am more than please as i have been using this cream for the past month. Excellent cream that I gladly recommend for people with delicate/sensitive skin such as myself.</li>
    <li> One day I woke up with what seems like the worst skin next to an elephant.  50 years old marked a drastic change to a once vibrant, supple, wrinkle free and youthful looking skin. I&#x27;ve agressively and diligently tried absolutely everything on the market and nothing worked permanantly. Well, some things did work, but on the surface and I wanted something that would effect a skin change. At this age, products that once worked, all of a sudden seemed to be ineffective. At the advice of skin care specialist they advised that I use a product with collagen. After reading the many positive reviews about St. Ives,I ordered and gave it a try. Amazing how quickly this cream works within days I noticed a drastic difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance and texture. The severe dryness is gone and the fine lines are as well. The brightness and texture of my former years have returned. I&#x27;m delighted and proud of the success I&#x27;ve achieved with this product. This is a large generous jar and the price is exceptional. This product is a must add to your cosmetic boudoir. (P.S. I am African American with very dry skin (since turning 50), I use St. Ives along with Palmers Fade Cream (for occasional dark spots and acne marks)...does the job and works wonders. My skin is beautiful, bright and youthful looking. I highly recommend and good luck!</li>
    <li> Very creamy, but after four or so days of use, my face started turning red after use, then the next day my neck started itching, then the next day my face started itching and my neck itched and broke out  along with having red patches.  I quit using the product and finally the itch etc has cleared.  Sorry, I wanted it to work, but it just didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I could drone on about my experience in using this for a decade but let&#x27;s cut to the chase. Buy it. Try it. It is worth it. You&#x27;re skin drinks it up and leaves you with a soft, comfortable face without any residue what so ever. Buy it, you&#x27;ll be a convert, too.</li>
    <li> I HAVE TRIED SEVERAL SKIN PRODUCTS FROM THE MOST EXPENSIVE TO THE MOST PRESCRIBED BY DOCTORS AND THIS CREAM IS WAY BETTER THAN OTHERS, IT IS NOT GREASY BUT IT HAS ALL THE ELEMENTS AND NUTRIENTS FOR THE SKIN. I USE IT ON MY FACE,NECK EVEN ARMS AND FOR THE PRICE IS TOO GOOD.    I USE IT TWICE A DAY AND NOW MY SKIN HAS A NATURAL GLOW, EVEN MY FINE LINES ARE GONE.</li>
    <li> we are on our 4th bottle of this stuff works well even my husband is taking a liking to it...makes wrinkles go away well takes a few days then its gone especially crows feet.</li>
    <li> didnt help my aging skin</li>
    <li> when i was ordering this, i was surprised how cheap this was...&lt;br /&gt;when i got it, i was surprised how big it was...&lt;br /&gt;cheap but big...&lt;br /&gt;there must be a reason for that...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to me, i don&#x27;t feel like this is doing anything much to my skin (i am in my40&#x27;s)...&lt;br /&gt;besides, it is too watery for my liking (more into creamy style)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;understand collagen does wonders for skins but have to doubt the concentration on this one...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you may like it but for me, it just did not work...</li>
    <li> Mineral Oil is the main ingredient here.  Not Good for the skin.  Most cosmetics companies have given up claiming that collagen and elastin can reduce wrinkles when applied topically. St. Ives is still trying to tell us the miniscule amounts of each in this moisturizer will actually make a difference - they won&#x27;t.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I happened to watch Dr. Oz&#x27;s show when he announced this cream.  The derm doc confirmed that this cream is as good for your skin as the really expensive creams.  Looking forward to saving money on that.  Thanks Dr. Oz!!!  She explained all the components of the cream, and what it addressed.  I am a nurse, and really appreciate all the REAL knowledge associated with the skin, and what creams can do for your face, and body.  Read up America, and buy wise.</li>
    <li> This product was arecommended by&lt;br /&gt;dr. Oz and it is what he said. My experience buying it was very good.Amazon came through very well.</li>
    <li> This cream is perfect.  Scent is pleasant without being overdone, but mainly the consistency of the cream is heavenly.  I&#x27;m sold on this and it was represented well.</li>
    <li> St. Ives Timeless Skin Collagen Elastin Facial Moisturizer...I&#x27;m just not impressed. Yes, its light-weight and non-greasy, but when I first applied it on my skin after using the St. Ives Scrub and then a cleanser, it felt like it was stinging my face for a good minute or two. Then it just absorbed into my skin, but it didn&#x27;t feel like my face felt more hydrated or nicer. It was okay, no holy grail product here. I found it at Bed, Bath and Beyond by accident when I could not find it elsewhere, and it was sold for $4.99 a jar. I had to return this one today, just didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> Go&#x27;s  on smooth , feels good  but really haven&#x27;t  noticed any differance in the appearance of my skin. I prefer jojoba oil.</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for the past 3 weeks and I love it! I have oily skin and whenever I use a moisturizer at night, the next morning I&#x27;m very oil in the T-zone area. However, this moisturizer does not make my skin oily. This does not make me break out. It feels great on the skin. I&#x27;m 23 years old and I really don&#x27;t have fine lines or wrinkles so I can&#x27;t tell you if it helps with those. My skin does look healthy and hydrated thanks to this moisturizer. I bought mines at Walmart for less than $5.00. It is well worth the price and you get tons of product. I love it and I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Wow, great moisturizer! I got this moisturizer for the winter months when my face is expecially dry. Other moisturizers either left my face oily or peeling, but this one was great. It left my face feeling supple and looking bright. Im only 18, so wrinkles are not an issue, but I&#x27;ll continue to use this and hopefully it will help prevent them. The moisturizer also did not make my face break out, and the price is GREAT. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product is very light and can be put on before morning make up and doesnt bleed through and can also be used as a night moisterizer.  Works great for the money.</li>
    <li> A very light texture. Absorbing very quick.&lt;br /&gt;I can feel your skin getting elastic after few weeks. Good try :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 10 years and really like it. I use it before foundation makeup every morning.</li>
    <li> Honestly it&#x27;s not the best choice for dry skin, but I still love it. It has the almond like scent. Hubby loves it on his combination skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate his eyes. I am glad I didn&#x27;t buy pack of 3, it takes forever to finish 1 jar, BIG size.</li>
    <li> i have been using this for years and i love it</li>
    <li> I have been using this for three years now. You would be hI ard pressed to find something this affordable that works wonders. I use it every morning and night. It makes my skin feel fresh and makes it glow. I love it!</li>
    <li> I bought it for use as a night cream but it made my oily/combo skin even oilier at night.  The texture of my skin did improve, though.  I would recommend this cream for those with normal to dry skin instead.</li>
    <li> works better than the costly s***!</li>
    <li> My family and I used to buy St Ives products in Margarita Island (tax free place), but due to control exchange and perhaps marketing issues they&#x27;re not longer found in my country. Last year I ordered from Amazon a three-10 oz-jar offer of this cream, a bargain for the price, the jars size, and the better quality compared with other expensive brands I&#x27;ve tried. My mother and I shared the contents, and I even gave part of it to one of my sisters. After six months  or more I&#x27;m just finishing my jar. But I&#x27;ve already ordered a new 10 oz jar last december, so I can keep using it without interruption.  I have oily skin, and the texture of this cream is light and non-greasy, it absorbs very quickly and I love the smell (I&#x27;ve abandoned other creams because of their smell). I don&#x27;t see any difference with the new formula. Both work nicely. I use it morning and night and my skin looks clearer, hydrated, smoother and I feel it more elastic. After some months using it everybody tells my face and neck look nicer. I do believe in the effects of this St Ives moisturizer, I love it. While I can keep on buying and using it, I will, and my mother will do as well!! I&#x27;ve also used other St Ives products now and in the past and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed. Actually I exfoliate my face weekly with St Ives Apricot Scrub Blemish&amp;Blackhead Control, it removes dirty from my pores; immediately I put a more generous amount of St Ives Collagen Elastin face moisturizer and leave my face without any makeup at least for an hour or two.</li>
    <li> I initially bought St Ives Collagen Elastin Face Moisturizer years ago, not because of anyone&#x27;s recommendation, but because the St Ives line is CRUELTY FREE - something that is very important to me.  I had been using the Apricot Facial Scrub (which I love and still use) and started looking around for a daily moisturizer that was not greasy but did the job.  I found it in this product - it is amazing and I would still buy it if it cost twice as much as it does now.  I had been using Burts Bees Carrot Daily Moisturizer, which is a great product (and also cruelty free), but it was a little heavy in the summer for day time use (I still use it at night!).  I cannot recommend St Ives products enough!</li>
    <li> Within minutes of appling this lotion, my face turned bright red and I developed little red bumps all over my face and neck. Do Not Use if you have sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I used this lotion all through out pregnancy and never got a stretch mark. Now i use it on my face, which usually can&#x27;t handle any moisturizer at all, not only is the scent light and fresh, but it hasn&#x27;t had anything other than a VERY positive effect on my skin!No breakouts and it isn&#x27;t greasy at all! Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have a combination skin and it didnt work for me at all but i think it would be good for oily skins becouse of the light and fast absorbeding texture.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this stuff on her face and she loves it. It is great for cleaning her face more than just soap. Also, it leaves her face nice and soft from the moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> So I waited a few weeks post purchase to test this product before writing a review and I can now say I officially love it. I often have problems finding a moisturizer that can sit under my makeup without my makeup smudging or sweating into it, also I live in A hot African climate and I am always struggling to find a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t sweat into skin and cause more skin breakouts. Needless to say this product is perfect- it leaves my skin feeling incredibly moisturized without the oily feel and I can now put makeup on straight after without having to wait for moisturizer to dry. Love this product, very very happy i won&#x27;t have to shop around anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this cream at night because I want to use a moisturizer w/ SPF in the daytime. But I really like it so far. Been using it for over a week. It is not greasy and absorbs well.  Also, the jar is huge, and a little goes a long way, so I think it&#x27;ll last quite some time, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  I don&#x27;t feel I should comment on the anti-aging properties, as I&#x27;m using a combination of products with anti-aging claims at this time.</li>
    <li> Just the right moisturizer, not heavy and immediately absorbed into skin leaving face soft and fresh. Skin texture looks light and dewey. Price is right too!</li>
    <li> For the price, this can&#x27;t be beat!  I love the smell, and it just sinks into your skin!  Lovely product, really.  My old hold back on this one is that since using it the past 3 weeks, my skin has broken out much more than usual.  I&#x27;m sure this is causing it cause I haven&#x27;t changed anything else, but I&#x27;m waiting to give it some more time and see if my skin \\&quot;calms down\\&quot;.  I really want to give it 5 stars, but the zits say no!</li>
    <li> If you have good skin most moisturizer will work just fine. But if your skin is dry, most wont absorb and moisturize your skin and just stay on top of it. Well, this one does the opposite of that. It is so thin, that it absorb so quickly and so long lasting. I put if on after shower at night, and in the morning shower, I can still feel that the moisturizer is still on.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product for a second time, I love it so much.  It is a wonderful facial moisturizer and costs so much less than anything I can get at the store.  It comes in a bigger than usual jar, as well.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer, it dosen&#x27;t clog pores or cause acne, best of all it is not tested on animals, or contains, pthalates, and parabens.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like spending too much money on hyped up face products, so I was happy to find this moisturiser. It&#x27;s very reasonably priced and works well during the winter to keep my face from feeling dry. I was also pleasantly surprised by the quantity, the jar is 10 oz, most other brands I&#x27;ve purchased are 3 oz or less. I will mention that the moisturizer doesn&#x27;t instantly absorb the way some others I&#x27;ve used do. The first time I used it, I was worried that it seemed a bit greasy as I applied it, but after a few seconds it was fine. A little does go a long way, and I expect that this one giant container will last quite a while.</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer on my face for 25 years or so.  It is, without qualification, the best.  I&#x27;ve tried more expensive moisturizers from the department store designer beauty aisles -- the ones that cost 5 times more than this! -- and I keep going back to my beloved St. Ives. It feels great, smells nice, and does not aggravate my skin in any way.  I&#x27;m so glad to find it here, as I&#x27;m almost out of my last pink/maroon jar of the previous packaging.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. I use it mostly as a body moisturizer after a shower--for my winter dry skin.</li>
    <li> Super light weight moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. I use it several times through out the day on my face and have noticed a difference in my face being a lot less dry.</li>
    <li> I just recently started using this product since I read the reviews and I can say that I love the feeling it leaves on my skin.  This is a must have moisturizer for me from now on.  The product arrived in great condition and very fast.</li>
    <li> It is a nice moisturizer but, well its kind of sloppy. The Product is very thin, good for not over moisturizing but it gets everywhere. As for the collagen/ elastin aspects, I have seen no change for better or worse. I figure this is one of those products that will work for some people. I didn&#x27;t for me but hey, no harm no foul.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m returning this because it wasnt sealed in any way outside or inside.  Cant be expected to use a product in that condition, like maybe my friend or family handed it to me basically, particularly coming from many miles away through a distribution line, manufacturing line, etc... Could have been returned then redistributed as far as I know.  Amazon is really at a level to require more of itself when distributing these type personal care products to consumers.</li>
    <li> Its like lotion for your face, literally. It has a lotion consistency and feel when I first tried it out but now im used to it. I love the price of this product and the smell is really nice. I hate the packaging though, unsanitary. Also when I apply this, it sort of stings, but not unbearable so make sure to completely shut your eyes when putting this on. I do have deep ish lines under my eyes from my ignorance when I was younger and just started to use eyeliner (19 yrs old here) and I did notice that the lines are not that noticable anymore (but this was not the purpose why I bought this moisturizer so 3 stars)</li>
    <li> My first one was bought at walmart and I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore. Then I found this moisturizer and decided to order. To me, the formula seems to be more liquidy(?) than the first one. The tub lasts for awhile though. I only use it to moisturize before I put on my make up because it dries pretty fast. If the formula is like this, I wouldn&#x27;t buy any more after this.</li>
    <li> Thought I would start trying to take better care of myself.  I have never really had issues but I thought I would go ahead and just try this product anyhow as a preventative measure..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer since the beginning of January (after reading all the rave reviews and ordering it from Amazon) and I just love it!  My face always feels well moisturized, but not greasy as it can with some heavy creams.  The scent and texture of this moisturizer are great and I would definitely recommend it to anyone!    And if you&#x27;re worried about using it with breakouts/troubled skin, don&#x27;t worry!  I tend to break out very easily and have combination skin (oily t-zone, with patches of dry skin mixed in), and this moisturizer has not caused any breakouts or made my skin oily.    Definitely give it a try!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this moisturizer! So worth the money. It leaves my skin feeling so smooth and not at all greasy. I use this moisturizer at night &amp; one with spf for day.</li>
    <li> I bought this moisturizer for the price, but I actually like it. Is it the best in the world? No. However, it does work a lot better than some of my $50 creams.</li>
    <li> Light cream, not sticky or greasy at all. Very fast delivery and it&#x27;s a huge jar, compared to most moisturizers jars. I&#x27;m been using it for a week now, and no allergies or problems at all. Recommend it.</li>
    <li> Moisturizing is very important for all ages. As a broke college student, I bought this as a cheap replacement for my more expensive Burt&#x27;s Bees/Origins picks because I like more natural brands. It is certainly better than nothing and you get a lot more product than in most facial moisturizers, but I immediately noticed a difference in my skin -- and not a good one at that. Folks, you get what you pay for, if you are like me and you have to use this to get by, that&#x27;s fine, but in the long run you should invest in your skin. I have gone back to using my Origins Night-A-Mins, and I think that all of the Burt&#x27;s Bees moisturizers are quality as well if you don&#x27;t want to spend big money (IMHO).</li>
    <li> I tried several creams, non really helped the look of my skin. I tried cerave cream, which is fantastic, but did not improve the look. This cream literally worked several hours after i applied, it improved the tone and the pore size. I don&#x27;t know how but it works well. The 2nd ingredient is mineral oil for those of you that are sensitive to it. It abosorbs very well and does not feel heavy, its even lighter than cerave. I never knew a moisterizer was supposed to repair your skin until I usd this stuff.</li>
    <li> good for dry skin as it absorbs well and does not leave a greasy layer. However I am not sure the collagen benefits have been discovered on my face, although it does moisturize well.</li>
    <li> Been using this every night in my face and neck. I am in my twenties so I can&#x27;t say it got rid of anything but it&#x27;s a good maintenance product.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both love this moisturizer. Great value. Buying again! Can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s necessarily helping with wrinkles but we love it anyway!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: still using 2 year later, and still love it!! Will buy again and again. Always get many components on my skin.</li>
    <li> Following the lead that Amazon prefers reviews of products other than books, music, films, etc and due to the increasing cold weather that seems to be sweeping the country this winter, this is another very fine product from St Ives.  Coupled with the 24 hour advance moisturizer body lotion, this product is for use on the face and neck (it is also excellent for elbows!) as a means to protect the skin of the face form the drying effects of cold weather as well as the sagging effects of aging skin. The cream is easy to apply: no need for pads or sticks here, just scoop it out of the jar and massages into the entire face (except the eyes) and neck...not forgetting the ears.  The recipe is apparently all natural - being derived form the essence of apricots, olives, minerals etc - so unless there is an allergic reaction to the fragrance used it should be safe for all skin types.  As with most of the products from St. Ives is is immediately absorbed by the skin and does not leave a residuum on the surface that could be comedogenic. Important that it be used both day and night - day, for exposure to the elements, night to restore any damage incurred by the drying heat of the home.  A very good product at a very reasonable price. Grady Harp, December 11</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is everything they say it is and more. I have been using this product for about 2 years now and it will always be a part of my daily regimen.</li>
    <li> Trying to find a facial moisturizer free of vitamin A and parabens that was not too pricey was a challenge! Luckily St. Ives came through with a great product and you get a lot of it for a very great price! I use this both in the AM and PM after washing my face. It has definitely improved the overall look and feel of my skin and has not caused me to break out anymore than usual. I also really like the scent of it :)</li>
    <li> Love this product!! Been using it for years, as a night cream, and also under my makeup during the day. Very light, non greasy. I did switch to another product for about a week---and I could see a big negative difference in my skin...so, I am back to using this product.</li>
    <li> My skin is oily/sensitive and after using this my face broke out like crazy. i stopped using it for a week and it cleared back up. i don&#x27;t think it was much different than any current moisturizer you would be using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the price is good though if your skin can handle it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 34 and recently noticed that my skin was beginning to show its age. A few months ago I went through a very bad bout of anxiety. Thankfully I&#x27;m doing better now, but deep frown lines on my forehead were a lasting reminder and a big disappointment. I decided to buy this lotion after a blogger, who switched from a much more expensive product, recommended it. I have tried many other products and nothing ever really seemed to help my skin. I&#x27;m always skeptical of products that claim to reduce wrinkles, especially something so inexpensive. I bought just as another moisturizer to try, not to get rid of wrinkles. Imagine my surprise when a month or so later I realized that my frown lines are significantly reduced! I have to look very closely to see faint traces, where before the wrinkles were very prominent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this cream liberally every night after washing my face. It&#x27;s thick and seems, dare I say, greasy when first applied. My skin is prone to breakouts, so I was worried at first, but my face did not react badly at all. Even though my face feels greasy for a while, the lotion absorbs/dries nicely after a few minutes. I think it has a soothing, relaxing smell that is a nice way to end the day. This product is definitely a winner for me, and the affordable price is a huge bonus.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  For the price it is worth using specially for oily face. SO enjoy. This is a good product.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a lotion just for my face but didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot.  This lotion is great!  It&#x27;s not greasy and you only need a little.  My husband uses it now too!</li>
    <li> This product is very good.  Not greasy like some.  I couldnt find it in the store so I tried online and found it!!!  I have been using this product for about 5 years now!!  I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a good moisturizer for my skin for a long time now. Everything was too greasy or something in it would make me break out. This is perfect for my face, and holy cow the jar is huge! I use it every morning on my face and neck, and it keeps my skin perfectly hydrated without oil/grease showing up later and melting my makeup off. Really like this formula and will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this moisturizer on Amazon, but saw it at Walmart and picked it up. I thought it was a good price and I didn&#x27;t have anything to lose.  A little background on me: I just turned 20, and have had moderate (so, not awful, but pretty bad) inflammatory acne since I was about 18 1/2. Before that, I had perfect skin and didn&#x27;t do anything but wash my face. Ever since my skin began breaking out, I&#x27;ve been desperately trying to find something that would work. I was using ProActiv&#x27;s repairing lotion, lots of different scrubs, cleansers, etc.  When I got this, I stopped using EVERYTHING, except a gentle Neutrogena cleanser, and this moisturizer. Now, I just cleanse my face twice a day, and put this moisturizer on in the morning and at night. I dip about three or four fingers in, so I put on a fair amount. I always use a lot of product, and it really does wonders.  While it didn&#x27;t clear up my acne totally (I&#x27;m on a medication for that right now), it made it a LOT better, and calmed my skin down.  I highly recommend it! Thank you, St. Ives!</li>
    <li> I saw it on Dr. Oz.  I don&#x27;t buy into some of his recommendations but decided to try this.  Hard to get but Amazon had it.  It much less expensive than name products and much more skin friendly.  In other words, I love it!!</li>
    <li> hello there, my name is diana natalia and I am a professional makeup artist.&lt;br /&gt;and of course because of that I am also very particular when it comes to skin care. I believe that it is always better to put make up on a face which is completely hydrated and supple. i have really dry skin and face and this is just AMAAAAHYZZZINGGGGG. i recommend this to anyone out there who needs some refreshing stuff on their face and also for more hydration!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;@dianamarianatalia&lt;br /&gt;facebook.com/diananataliamakeup&lt;br /&gt;diananataliamakeup.wordpress.com</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m enjoying this face cream so far. Doesn&#x27;t make me break out and is really comfortable and moisturizing.  Large quantity too so I won&#x27;t be running out any time soon!</li>
    <li> I use this every week and my face has seemed to lighten and soften. I now has less blackheads and whiteheads and haven&#x27;t had a breakout since. I love it!</li>
    <li> I love the creamy consistency however, it has mineral oil as one of the ingredients and causes me to break out. I was using it in the morning and evening but now I am trying it only in the evening and I want to see if that works.  I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet. I guess it may take some time. But if you have oily skin I would be cautious on using this product due to the mineral oil. I am a little surprised that Dr Oz didn&#x27;t question this when he recommended it.</li>
    <li> Love the feel of this when I put it on in the morning/night - it&#x27;s not in the least bit greasy - it feels great and it works to keep your face moisturized. I am outside alot and keeps my face from feeling tight and dry which for me is a bonus.</li>
    <li> Great lotion. It was a very good purchase and im glad that ibought it. It has been very useful to me since getting it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Curel Anti-Aging Lotion on my face for the past few years, but Curel dropped that product, and I had a jar of this Collagen Elastin Moisturizer that I had only worked half way through, so I&#x27;m using it again.  After reading all of the positive reviews, I&#x27;m going to try adopting this as my replacement product moving forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I live in Southern California, and I checked my local CVS and Walgreens with no luck, but Rite-Aid has a bunch of it for a lower price than it&#x27;s listed for here on Amazon.  Good option for those near a Rite-Aid.</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing! I&#x27;ve spent so much money on products for my face that were such a waste of money. I love how it instantly made my face feel fresh, moisturized &amp; radiant withOut being oily, it&#x27;s light not heavy like some expensive creams are &amp; it smells so good &amp; fresh! To me it is perfect.  It works, It helped my skin look fresh,radiant &amp; healthy!! I will be purchasing it again! Very much worth buying. I&#x27;m so happy to have found this moisturizer! (I also use the St. Ives apricot facial scrub to wash my face with) which is another great item :)</li>
    <li> This product seemed like it was opened previously because it was only halfway full.  I contacted Amazon and they were great about giving me a refund.  They let me keep the item anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try it out.  This was actually a good product.  I tested it on one hand and not the other.  I went to bed.  Woke up, the hand I tested it on was soft and the other hand was dry as before.  So for your hands or body, it&#x27;s a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this on my face and I noticed pimples within a few days.  I do not get pimples anymore, except once in a blue moon.  So it was very unusual for me to get pimples after using this product.  I didnt&#x27; believe it was the product so I stopped using it to test my theory.  No more pimples.  I wanted to test it again because I wanted to go buy a new item since I felt this one may have been tampered with.  But I wanted to make sure this product wasn&#x27;t giving me pimples.  So I tested it again by using it on my face.  Again, I got a few pimples within a few days.  Therefore, I am attributing my breakout in pimples to this product even though it says non-comedogenic (sp?), I don&#x27;t believe it.  For some reason, using the product gave me pimples.  On the hands, only softness and no rash or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I concluded that this product gave me the pimples and so I will not order any more of it.  It works great on the hands, but I have other lotions that I use on my hands.  I really need something for my face that will not give me pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think everyone will get pimples with this product, but for some reason it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> This face moisturizer is terrible. It dried out my skin so badly. The first couple days it was okay, then i started getting dry patches on my face. It doesn&#x27;t have a moisturizing feel at all. It comes in a large quantity, which makes it seem like a great deal, but i wouldn&#x27;t even use this on my body! Horrible. Horrible product. I might use it for my feet, but that&#x27;s about it!</li>
    <li> The lotion is a nice consistency and does a decent job. I don&#x27;t know about is elastin claim, but it&#x27;s a nice night time lotion. But as others have said before, it is kind of annoying that it is in a tub, and does feel a little unsanitary just digging in like that. But on a plus side you are able to get every last bit of the moisturizer out of the tub! - Overall good product for the price</li>
    <li> The moisturizer is lighter than i thought it would be but it is a nice moisturizer</li>
    <li> I bought this moisturizer several years ago as a poor high school student because at my local chain store, it was only $4 for this amazingly large 10 oz tub. This is the size that you normally get body butter in, it&#x27;s really big. It lasted me about a year, and then I started working and using Body Shop products. However, I&#x27;m considering purchasing this again because it really firmed up my skin and neck. I&#x27;ve been overweight since puberty, and when I was using this, I didn&#x27;t have a double chin, neckroll, or any sign from the shoulders up that I was the size I was and still am (20!). Now at the age of 22, my skin is starting to show the first signs of aging - I now have very slight crow&#x27;s feet (eek!) - and while most anti-aging products are pricey, this is the best deal for the amount of moisturizer you receive that I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer!!    Makes your skin sooo soft.  Can use under liquid foundation as well. And does not make skin oily at all.  I use twice a day and it really improves the texture and feel of my skin.    No real fragrance so will not bother you in that respect.    Also, the container is HUGE!  Great buy for that price.    Awesome!    Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> irritated my face. will use as body lotion.</li>
    <li> Compared to other facial moisturizer that I have gotten so far, this one has been the most economical! It is a great buy! As for the the content, the cream smells really nice, however, it was slightly too strong for me as I&#x27;m very sensitive to scented products. It provides really good moisture, but have to apply 3 times a day. Unlike my other moisturizers, this absorbs immediately to the skin allowing more time for those who uses moisturizers to prep before make up. I really recommend this to those who are trying to find a moisturizer which is not outrageously priced, long lasting, and great performance!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife online and found it for $4 at Walmart!! I ordered it a few hours ago and now it is too late to cancel the order!!! Almost $17 for this product over 4x more paid!!!</li>
    <li> I had some pretty dry skin for a while and this helped a lot, it lasts forever too! Love it.</li>
    <li> HONESTLY AFTER READING THE REVIEWS I THOUGH THAT MAYBE THIS CREAM WOULD DO SOME NICE THINGS. IT HONESTLY WORKS AS ANY OTHER LOTION I HAVE USED. YES IT DOES MAKE MY SKIN SOFT BUT THATS THE MOST I CAN SAY FOR THIS CREAM</li>
    <li> Had high expectations for this product. I have dry skin. Used it once and it simply dried out my skin more leaving dried skin bits that looked like dandruff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and I love it.  I keep thinking I need a more expensive moisturizer, but I keep coming back to this one.  I also use it for all-over moisture, not just my face.</li>
    <li> I have purchased a number of different moisturizers in the past and always only used them a few times and then stopped.  Mostly it was because of the feel or the smell.  Spent way more on them than I did on this product, too.  Now I bought this figuring the price was right even if I only used it a few times.  What a pleasant surprise it was!  It&#x27;s very fluffy, not heavy or greasy at all.  The smell is very subtle and FRESH.  Not chemically.  It&#x27;s not goopy like other products I have tried.  I think it really does make my skin feel smoother.  It goes on easily and is very light.  I have used other St. Ives products such as their cleansers and were very satisfied with them too.</li>
    <li> My mom and I love it!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with how fast this product got to me, as well as how goooood it works. My skin feels awesome! Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works great for winter! I have oily combination skin and I have only tried this during winter and it doesn&#x27;t make me oilier. It keeps my skin moisturized throughout the day and I don&#x27;t get any dry patches when I wear this on.</li>
    <li> Saw a comparison of this product, with several other very expensive moisturizers, on the Today Show a few months back.  I couldn&#x27;t find this product in any department store, or any other store in my area, so I went on Amazon where I do most of my online shopping.  I have used St. Ives products, on and off, for 30 years and none of them have disapointed me.  After I had my second child, at 36, my face became blotchy, red, and scarred looking.  I remembered using the St. Ives Apricot Scrub before, and it was on the Today Show in a test comparison with other very expensive cleansers/exfoliators.  The Today show reccomended the St. Ives Apricot Scrub Blemish &amp; Blackhead Control.  They (Today Show) also reccomended the St Ives Facial Moisturizer, Timeless Skin Collagen Elastin above all other simular test products(those ranged in prices between $20-$100&#x27;s of dollars).&lt;br /&gt;  I used the St. Ives Apricot Scrub as soon as I got it, once.  The very next morning I went into the bathroom to take a shower.  I glanced in the mirror, forgetting that I used the scrub the night before, and I was in shock.  I looked at my face, at the age of 41, and my face looked really good.  The brown blotches were gone, the blackheads were tremendously fewer, the scarring was not as noticeable, the blotchy redness, that was all over my face, wasn&#x27;t just getting better but gone!  I mean my face looked aged and unkept just one day before.  Everyone who saw me that day was shocked.  I didn&#x27;t tell them what I used or anything.  They just said, \\&quot;Damn you look really good.  What happened?\\&quot;  I also bought the St. Ives Collagen Elastin Moisturizer.  Used it for a week and saw great progress in lines.  Stuff is awesome!!!!</li>
    <li> We love this stuff, my husband was stealing my very expensive facial moisturizer so I switched to this to cut costs as he always uses a ton. This worked just as well as the 50 dollar cream I kept buying and it dries so nicely, no oily residue or shiny skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to give you an idea, we are in our mid 20&#x27;s and live in Florida where we are constantly out in the brutal sun and chlorinated water which leaves our skin very dry. This is perfect for us.</li>
    <li> Nice nourishing moisturizer. I use it in conjunction with Japanese paper facial masks, so it&#x27;s like a spa treatment. Leaves my skin very soft! not too greasy or sticky.</li>
    <li> Saw it recommended on Dr. Oz thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  Really like the stuff, not greasy at all.  In fact very light and smooth going on the skin -- would bathe in it if I could!</li>
    <li> If you are on the fence about buying this, just do it! Your skin will thank you and you will feel helluva sexy with smooth skin.  Will never be without this concoction again.</li>
    <li> The amount and quality for the price is just unimaginably too good to be true. You get sooo much for so little and the product is great! No complaints here Have it on subscription delivery with Amazon.</li>
    <li> after i use it my skin is tight and i have to reaplpy</li>
    <li> I used this product for a while and it was wonderful. It made my skin very firm and soft. Sadly, I had to stop using it shortly after I started because it broke my face out. I miss it. I gave what was left to my mother and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this over a year ago looking for a nice facial cream and this is not it!  It doesn&#x27;t feel good on the skin.  It&#x27;s okay, but not great.  It feels like a cheap facial cream.  The smell is okay though.  I&#x27;ve been trying to give it away, but no one seems to want it... I wonder why? lol.  It comes in a huge jar too.  It would take someone 10 years to use the amount of cream that comes in this jar.  Overall, I was highly disappointed in this facial cream and can&#x27;t find anyone who wants it.  A waste of money, in my opionion.  There are much better and higher quality facial creams out there, for sure!</li>
    <li> Bought 1 at Walmart..first day: felt so good..tight and very smooth skin when I woke up.&lt;br /&gt;Second day: felt good and smooth too but skin got little bit red.&lt;br /&gt;Third day: my skin was peeling and getting extremely itchy accompanying with red spots which made me stopped and now after 2 days the itch and redness are still there. I did take some Cetirizine but it only works for few hours and the itch will soon come back.. Will update as time goes and I really hope my skin can be back to normal.</li>
    <li> Have used it for years, I still love it</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a lot of alcohol in this product so it burns my face, and there&#x27;s a lot of water in it so it&#x27;s very runny to</li>
    <li> Why is smells so much  as not natural product.</li>
    <li> I never thought I am a picky customer especially when it comes to moisturizers since I am only beginning to use them. The St. Ives Moisturizer does not change the condition of your skin or improve it. It does moisturize well, it smells great and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. For the price, I would say it is an okay moisturizer. I wouldn&#x27;t use it as an anti-aging moisturizer or anything but a light face lotion.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is really good, it does all what it says (and is very cheap too)&lt;br /&gt;The smell is nice, not very strong. It is not a typical age defying sorts of cream, but somehow it does make the skin look very young. I have noticed difference from the very first day. The consistency is nice too, does not make your skin look oily, you can use it after bath, at night and you would see visibly smooth, glowing skin. I just love the moisturizer. Btw, I am not Sanjeev, but his wife who is writing this review :-)&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect for people who do not want to overdo their skin care, I use this with St Ives apricot scrub and their green tea face cleanser and I do not need anything else for my skin. So Simple and effective. (Btw I am an Indian , 31 yr old) Everybody must try it once!</li>
    <li> Best Face lotion Ive ever used. Water based, very pure feeling and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or doesn&#x27;t make you feel oily. Great, buying again.</li>
    <li> For the price this is the best moisturizer I have found and I have been shopping for moisturizers since 1954.  St. Ives Facial Moisturizer works better than any high end to low end product I have tried.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent moisturizer. It feels very light but is very effective on dry-to-normal skin. Like all of the St Ives Products it is priced well making it a great value.</li>
    <li> I just went into walmart over the weekend and decided to check out the facial section for the last time before ordering this on amazon for $9. To my surprise and amazement, they did carry the product and I bought it immediately.    I am currently also using the timeless skin face wash. The both smell great and make a good pair. Before using this moisturizer, my skin does become very dry after shower. The day I bought it, before I went to bed, I put some on my face and my neck as well. I woke up with super soft and moisturized skin! I really am impressed with this product.     Check your local stores before ordering online. You might be able to save some $$$.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 43 yo male.  And I was just starting to have problems with baggy eyes.  They&#x27;ve always been a slight bit puffed.  But I finally hit the age where I could see some sag.  I use this product and Dickinson&#x27;s Witch Hazel (natural astringent).  After a few weeks use (1-2x/day), I could see a huge improvement.  It&#x27;s like I rolled the clock back several years.  The witch hazel cleared out some of the darkness, which I didn&#x27;t really notice before.  And the St Ives really tones up the skin with the collagen &amp; elastin.  I didn&#x27;t really have high hopes and I was really surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With regards to the comments about mineral oil clogging pores, etc.  I haven&#x27;t had that problem at all.  The exact opposite actually.  To be fair, I don&#x27;t know if my cleaner complexion is due to the moisturizer / witch hazel combo, or if it&#x27;s simply due to me taking better care of my skin.  I hadn&#x27;t been doing much of anything for my skin until recently.</li>
    <li> I love this cream!  It&#x27;s my 2nd Jar.</li>
    <li> This is such a great deal! A whole lot of product for a little money. The lotion is very calming and is very pleaseant feeling. I love it so much I use it on my whole body.</li>
    <li> Great Moisturizer. Not greasy. Absorbs quickly into skin. I would buy again for the quality and value. I have had good luck with St. Ives products.</li>
    <li> A really excellent product.  Worth buying.   light, not greasy but very moisturizing.  Sometimes I use it as a makeup remover and it leaves my skin soft and moist.</li>
    <li> Im just curious that why it has no seal on it , i just received it  and no seal made me a little disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot. I was buying $20 per small bottle aveeno face stuff but this keeps my skin even softer and it&#x27;s much cheaper. It has a little bit of a scent to it that takes some getting used to, but it&#x27;s still very light and not annoying. I&#x27;ve grown to like the scent. Even if I cake it on it never feels greasy.</li>
    <li> I have super dry and sensitive skin. In spring, my skin becomes even drier. I hate to look at myself every morning. After read the positive review of this product, I wanted to give it a try. The product is huge size for facial moisturizer. I had no idea how good it is until I tried it. It is so far the best moisturizer I ever try in my life. I have been using it for three days ,and my skin becomes more moisturized than ever before. Highly recommended this product to whoever is looking for a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have been using St. Ives Collagen Elastin Face Moisturizer for year and the product is affordable affordable and excellent.  It has maintained the same quality throughout the years. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This cream does seem to make my skin smoother and softer, but it is a heavier cream, so I notice build-up in my pores, so I try to use a mask once a week to wash everything away.  Not a bad product, though.</li>
    <li> this is very moisturizing and I think it will last me years, a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t tell a difference</li>
    <li> most face creams irritate eyes. not this one! a fantastic all over face cream,for day or night! feels great and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> This cream is very creamy and light. I use it on my arms and hands more than on my face and I&#x27;ve noticed that my hands look  younger and the tiny lines are filling in.  It leaves my skins moisturized all day.</li>
    <li> like the product &amp; price &amp; service...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 15 years, and was so pleased with it I&#x27;ve been sending friends and family to buy it on their trips abroad, since you can&#x27;t get it in Israel.  It is perfect for our hot and humid climate in the summer and dry cool in the winter, with it&#x27;s non-oily texture and fast absorption. And it is affordable and bulky, unlike most major cosmetic products.</li>
    <li> Yes the product will last a long while but it leaves ones face a bit greasy. More than that I bought this moisturizer but the jar came stained from the outside as if someone bought it and never used and decided to sell it years later. More than that after a couple of uses I stopped wearing simply because I wasn&#x27;t sure where the jar had been. St. Ives has great products but this one simply sucks!!!</li>
    <li> This is a good, extremely lightweight moisturizer. It was gentle and non-irritating, no overpowering fragrance. It just wasn&#x27;t right for me. My skin is very dry and needs more hydration. No matter how much I rubbed on, my skin still felt tight but looked shiny. It wasn&#x27;t until I switched to a different moisturizer and saw my skin actually improving did I realize that this moisturizer is not for me. I&#x27;d recommend it for normal types. Ladies and gents that don&#x27;t ever feel too dry or tight. Maybe even to those that have combination skin since it is lightweight. But for those with extremely dry and sensitive skin, make your way over to CeraVe.</li>
    <li> When I opened the box, the container was already broken. I asked to get new one, but the owners didn&#x27;t even reply. What is this?</li>
    <li> You have no idea how badly I wanted this to work, especially as it&#x27;s inexpensive and so many others gave it great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can still honestly say that it is a decent moisturizer - as long as I avoid putting it anywhere near my face.  I don&#x27;t know what it is, but it makes my face become red and irritated while also making my eyes puffy and swollen.  The only reasons I&#x27;m not giving this a one-star rating is because it&#x27;s very affordable and (at least so far) it doesn&#x27;t irritate my feet.  Of course, I didn&#x27;t buy a collagen cream to use on my feet and there are many other moisturizers I prefer for my feet.  Overall, I&#x27;d recommend trying this at your own risk.  There are far better products out there.</li>
    <li> It moisturizes well, but my skin broke out when I began using this product.  First time I have had acne in 30 years.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It has a light whipped texture and goes on incredibly smooth with a light fragrance. It&#x27;s not too heavy and not at all greasy and SO cheap! I&#x27;m in love!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. I use it twice daily after cleansing, toning, &amp; serum application; price is great, especially for quantity. Lasts 5 months when used twice daily. Light enough throughout the summer and thick enough during the winter months. No greasy after effect. If use too much at a time, it will make your face shiny, so use sparingly. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> great moisturizer! great service</li>
    <li> light and smooth. love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Very good product. it is effective, natural ingredients for fresher, younger looking skin. i like it very much, will buy more.</li>
    <li> Bought this about a month ago and had high hopes, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work that great for my face. Broke my face out and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. I&#x27;m assuming too much mineral oil or something.... I didn&#x27;t want it to go to waste so I started using it on my body and it leaves it super soft and silky. Plus the collagen is a waste because (after researching)it doesn&#x27;t penetrate the skin making it useless.....just sits there until you wash it off.</li>
    <li> It moisturizes very well, I just have a problem with the fact that it&#x27;s in a jar-like container rather than something that will help keep all the air out, like a bottle with a pump.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. It minimizes my wrinkles. I&#x27;ve recently been mistaken for a teenager and I&#x27;m way past teenager years. It felt so good. Thanks St. Ives.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. My face was really dry from the winter weather.  My skin is also sensitive. I noticed moisture right away but I noticed softer skin in about a week. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I was checking for a moisturizer with Collagen or Elastin this product has both.  That has got to be a good thing. Can&#x27;t lose with those 2 ingredients.  It has a nice texture and my dry skin seems to love it.  Good price as well.</li>
    <li> I used this cream and did not see any changes in my skin at all. Waste of money and time.</li>
    <li> My skin feels and looks better since I started using the cream.  I love the price for the amount of the cream you get.  I&#x27;ll buy it again!</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite moisturizer of all time and I can&#x27;t find it in stores. Nice and light in summer but gets rid of dry skin in the winter. My boyfriend loves it too!</li>
    <li> Love, love St Ives Facial moisturizer . Plus you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> loved it..really helps with oily skin.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes well without being sticky or oily.  I have Rosacea and am allergic to lots of things, but this treats me well.  It is available less expensively, if you look around however.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try as a face cream and didn&#x27;t care too much for it on my face.  But since this is quite a large jar and I did pay for it I thought I&#x27;d try it as a body lotion and, boy, was I pleasantly surprise!!!  I used it on my neck area and within two weeks I noticed that the wrinkles I was starting to notice have greatly diminished!  I would have given this lotion 5 stars but I don&#x27;t know if this is just wishful thinking or I&#x27;m really seeing what I&#x27;m seeing.  Time will tell.  I&#x27;m going to keep using it until it&#x27;s gone and I hope Amazon still carries this exact same lotion when I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> I liked this prooduct</li>
    <li> Amazing product and perfect for the entire body.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a while now and it works.  My skin is moist and hydrated.  Using this, my skin feels lush and supple.  I even use it on my rough elbows and they are smooth.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands and nothing gives me the same results as this does.  Everyone compliments my skin and I use this and the Apricot Scrub.</li>
    <li> moisturizers tend to feel cakey on my skin but this doesn&#x27;t. i love how fresh my face looks in the morning after i put this on overnight.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried others so its hard for me to say of this is a good one or not, but I like it.</li>
    <li> I saw this product on a Dr. Oz episode as a great alternative to those insanely expensive creams and it works extremely well. It moisturizes my skin, especially during the winter when my skin is very dry, without feeling oily or greasy. I also nice since it has a very light scent instead of a heavy perfume smell like so many other products. I use it under my tinted moisturizer and it&#x27;s definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  It is now very hard to find, only see it online. My mother has been buying and using this for many years.  At some point my daughter tried it and for months she has been asking me  to order it.  Finally, I did and I must admit, we both love it.</li>
    <li> It moisturizes but it leaves your skin oily after a couple of hours. But still a good buy.</li>
    <li> Not pleased that they have a new formula and are no longer animal friendly. They should be ashamed. Talk about a huge step backwards...&lt;br /&gt; Also after using it for several months I started getting little bumps on my forehead and pimples between my eysbrows. The little bumps turned out to be blackheads and I&#x27;m still trying to clear my face up after not using it for a couple of weeks now. Never again.</li>
    <li> Very good cream for the price and lasts a long time because a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have always been very fond of St. Ives products.  However, they do not appear to be made with all natural ingredients as had been before.  Ingredients such as come from flowers and herbs.  How come?</li>
    <li> Consistency is okay but fragrance is much too strong for me..I prefer a lightly scented facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love it I was nervous because I have sensitive skin and some times I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s dry or oily lol and I wanted to be able to put on my makeup and not have a issue with my moisturizer making my face oily but this is a very good moisturizer I like it .</li>
    <li> I want everyone to know how truly amazing this stuff is.  I have always had VERY sensitive skin and everything I used make me break out. I gave up using moisturizer for a long time because of it. When I heard how awesome this stuff was I tried it and was amazed at the first few times of use how GREAT my skin looked!  NO breakouts whatsoever. Not to mention my face was looking SO good. My skin looked more alive, brighter, tighter, and talk about smoothing!  My face is so unbelievably soft after using this that I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I have always been the type of person that would NEVER think of leaving the house without my makeup on. Now I leave the house makeup free and my skin truly looks flawless.  Cannot believe how great this makes makes my skin look. My boyfriend told me he cannot believe how soft my skin is and how good my face looks. I convinced him to start using it daily and now  he never goes without it anymore!  LOL.  He was looking in the mirror one day and said...&amp;#34;I must admit my skin looks A LOT better and my wrinkles don&#x27;t look as bad!  I said....see???  I told you!  I think anyone who says this stuff is awful is not receiving  the real thing. I know that happens sometimes with certain sellers on Amazon. There&#x27;s no way that nobody could ever not like this stuff!  I will never buy anything else!</li>
    <li> This cream&#x27;s first ingredient is water and second is mineral oil.  How could the nutrients in this cream penetrate the skin with mineral oil?</li>
    <li> I have bought real expensive creams but truly this one really feels nice...I apply it in the morning and actually through out the day...feels very nice and goes a long way. Smells good also</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is, hands down, my favorite moisturizer of all time. I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in any of the local stores here (Walmart, Walgreens NOR CVS) so I was relieved to see it on this site. When I was in college and flat broke, I first started using this because it was the cheapest moisturizer at Walmart, and my skin was so dry from winter weather. I never stopped using it (I&#x27;m now 25). I have a friend that swears by Bliss \\&quot;Youth as We Know It\\&quot; cream (WAY more expensive), so I tried her&#x27;s - it made my skin feel instantly greasy, and to be honest, I was so worried about the price I didn&#x27;t slather it on my face the way I can this stuff. My skin is sometimes dry, sometimes oily, super sensitive (even having SPF in a moisturizer will make my face break out), and always acne-prone (at least, until I started using this). Sometimes when I&#x27;m lazy or busy and don&#x27;t take care of my skin for a week - don&#x27;t wash my face before bed, etc. - and my skin breaks out, all I have to do is wipe my skin clean with a face wipe and then slather this stuff on at night for a day or two - and PRESTO my skin is back to being clear and smooth. Honestly it is a miracle for my skin. Also, I have lived in Seattle, Miami and Helena, Montana - so I have tested this in VASTLY different climates - and it has worked well for my skin in each city. It isn&#x27;t heavy - I can put it on, wait three minutes, and put on foundation make-up without a problem. LOVE THIS STUFF! Cannot say enough good things about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I have never left a review on Amazon before, but I love this so much and was so worried they discontinued it, that I thought I would leave a review so hopefully if they have their marketing people check, they will see one more person who loves it!</li>
    <li> The moisturizer has provided a great level of moisture to my old dry skin that I have not achieved with more expensive products.</li>
    <li> Should have listened to the one star reviews. My skin errs on the dry side, especially in the winter. After using it two nights in a row, I noticed flaking patches on my face, and the skin felt rough and stretched. Aloe body butter put my face right, thankfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s deceiving is that when I first put it on, it felt good, and my skin felt soft. Too bad, was expecting good things due to all the positive reviews. Think I&#x27;m going to give Cerave a shot.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone. My skin is combination and this is an excellent face cream. I have been using for 3 years after primarily using Mary Kay products, my boyfriend purchased this as his skin was dry, I started using it and now it is all I use. It&#x27;s just a good clean, simple product at a good price.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it--can feel the difference in my skin already! And the price is great for large jar!</li>
    <li> this is very good skin cream and I like the way it leaves my skin feeling I use it every day and sometime nights,but it really works for days makes the skin feel so soft and good for the day.</li>
    <li> works great.  Love the large size</li>
    <li> My wife and I both love this facial moisturizer. It&#x27;s not too thick and the consistency is just right in terms of moisturizing without being at all greasy. I can use this after washing my face before bed or after a shower. I also use on my head since I shave it daily. I don&#x27;t know if the collagen does any good but I know that I love this moisturizer and it&#x27;s an excellent value. This tub last a long time.</li>
    <li> I have used this before and I love it.  Have used more expensive products but this keeps moisture in my skin(face) and this is what I want.  I am 72 years old and I feel does what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> this is reasonably priced and it does a good job for moisturizing I have psoriasis and I bought this to help combat the dry kind of reddish areas on my face and I can honestly say it has started to help in a relatively short period of time,It goes on light and completely absorbs in it also has a mild fragrance like flowers but not strong at all but really pleasant so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it being too perfumey  just great stuff and no parabens</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is the lightest and the best moisturizer I have ever tried! It feels so good and it absorbs easily into my skin! My skin feel like a baby&#x27;s when I use it! the jar I have now is nearly empty and I will be buying some more in a couple of days.   Thank you for making such a great product! It plumps up the fine lines and wrinkles for my face and neck and throat. But my skin is so soft, it is utterly amazing!   Thank you, Thank You, Thank You!!!</li>
    <li> Through the years (I am 60 +) I have tried many, many creams and serums and not a single one comes anywhere near this one in all the qualities I want.  I have \\&quot;mature\\&quot; skin and St. Ives Timeless Skin Colagen Elastin Facial Moisturizer gives long lasting hydration, light \\&quot;plumping\\&quot;, skin softness, etc., etc., and etc!  It is very light, absorbs quickly and has only a very light pleasant fragrance.       I have to put on mental blinders when walking down the skin care isle... or browsing on-line... to avoid being \\&quot;sucked in\\&quot; by all the pretty jars and amazing promises, not to mention prices that seem to taunt that something has to cost a lot to be really good.  Not!  This moisturizer is so reasonably priced that I actually use it all over my body!       I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product... perhaps different skin types may find different favorites... but I personally recommend giving this a try!</li>
    <li> Good value moisturizer for everyday use.</li>
    <li> This product gives me terrible acne and breakouts. Very disappointing. Works well as a hand and body moisturizer but do not put on your face!</li>
    <li> Just received the product, but very much like the consistency and ingredients.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is super excellent !! I loved it!</li>
    <li> I love this product and you get such a great amount for the price that you are paying. Very satisfied. My skin feels amazing after using this product.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It has a nice scent and is not greasy and also does not irritate my skin.  Which is an added bonus as I have very sensitive skin.  I have not noticed any visible changes as of yet but have only been using the product for a few weeks now.</li>
    <li> I used the buy this product before I realized it is not as natural and they claim it is. It did make my face feel fresh but not worth the chemicals I am putting into my body.</li>
    <li> Really good, I use it every day.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday and definitely love it ! It feels so smoothy, no heady scent, no greasy feeling, lovely price and very well moisturizes my skin .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve using [[ASIN:B0017MO8AS St. Ives Timeless Skin Daily Microdermabrasion 4 oz (113 g)]] to wash my face, [[ASIN:B000GCQ04C Dickinson&#x27;s Original Witch Hazel Pore Perfecting Toner 16 oz.]] as a toner, [[ASIN:B000UVZU1S St. Ives Timeless Skin Collagen Elastin Facial Moisturizer, 10 Ounce]]as a moisturizar every morning and night and the [[ASIN:B001EBHNFO Palmers Cocoa Swivel Stick .5 oz.]]around my eyes and mouth every night and it&#x27;s just amazing.  My skin is prome to breakouts not a lot but after giving birth they&#x27;ve got worse, so i decided to use PROACTIV wich was ok. for a while but my skin started getting extremely dry.  The combination of those 4 products above helped me to keep my skin hydrated, clean and my breakouts are getting better.</li>
    <li> Caused me to break out in a red rash all over my face. Will be returning!!</li>
    <li> I use this for night time moisturizing.  Fantastic product and value. The lotion goes on very light and is not noticeable.</li>
    <li> This is as effective as far more costly products; particularly, in light of the fact that none of them can work miracles. Because the cost is right, no need to be stingy in using it. In fact, I also use it as a body lotion in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several weeks of use, my skin badly dried out from living in a dry climate, is far more healthy. The \\&quot;alligator skin\\&quot; has disappered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend St. Ives Timeless Skin Collagen Elastic Facial Moisturizer as an economical means of getting the same results experienced with many very pricey products. I will definitely keep bying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000UVZU1S St. Ives Timeless Skin Collagen Elastin Facial Moisturizer 10 oz (283 g)]]</li>
    <li> Works good on hands too</li>
    <li> It does the job. I use it everyday day. It has also lasted me a really long time and will probably get this same one when I run out.</li>
    <li> I love St. Ives products that I&#x27;ve tried but this cream tends to irritate my face a little so I use sparingly with a light touch when applying.</li>
    <li> I tend to have dry skin in the winter time. I tried this product out towards the end of winter/early spring. I found it very drying, and it&#x27;s no wonder why. When I looked at the list of ingredients, there was more fragrance in the product than either collagen or elastin. Those were the last two ingredients listed. If you want those two ingredients in your moisturizer, then this product is not for you. I&#x27;m now using it on my hands so it doesn&#x27;t go to waste.</li>
    <li> Discovered this product years ago to help with my facial dry skin.  This is a great product that works for me and I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> I love its smell and it fits me very well.</li>
    <li> Despite the price, it is a good Moisturizer, no blame.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now, and it has made a remarkable difference in my skin.  I use it as both a facial cream and a body cream.</li>
    <li> fast delivery, decent product. good price for a big box of moisturizer, could use it for a long time. However, it&#x27;s not keeping moist on the face very long, just a short time then have to apply again in a couple hours.</li>
    <li> I was already familiar with this product, but it is hard to find where I live.  I turned to Amazon because I have always had great success with Amazon, who often has most anything I need.  This moisturer not only lives up to its name, but is a great value for such a great product.  I have very sensitive, dry skin, and this cream surpasses any of the more expensive products that I have tried through the years.  I have been using St. Ives Products, and specifically this cream for at least 25 years, and have never been disappointed.  I highly recommend this product, the distributor, and certainly Amazon.</li>
    <li> My favorite moisturizer! I always use this one for my face after my bath. It leaves your skin feeling nice and smooth! Love it</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if its working (I&#x27;ve had this for at least 6 months) but I love the way it makes my face feel. Definitely is moisturized!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is quite heavy, and the smell reminds me of engine lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t break me out, so I will keep using it until the other moisturizer I have ordered comes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May be useful as a body cream.</li>
    <li> Noticeable difference in skin.  Wrinkles are not as deep.  Some have disappeared.  I use daily.  Also use on arms and elbows for dry skin.  Very light cream--does not clog pores.  Very good product for the price.  As good as many expensive face creams when used regularily.  I do not use soap.  I use this as a skin cleanser.</li>
    <li> This is a silky feeling face lotion that is great.  The cost through Amazon was more than comparable to driving around and finding it in the stores.</li>
    <li> it makes ur skin soft for sure .i have been using it for a week but havent seen any results on my wrinkles yet. hope it will work like the others said and i will be happy...</li>
    <li> When i bought this moisturizer, i was not expecting a big container. Let me tell you, it is! When i applied it i noticed that a little goes a long way so i know this container will last for a while. I will definitely buy this product again!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. I&#x27;ve seen that my lines are less visible and new lines have not formed since I started using it. I&#x27;m in my late 20s, so I&#x27;m getting to that age where I saw my first line and said NO MORE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it 1-2 times per day and usually let it really get into my skin before I put on makeup or do anything else with my face.</li>
    <li> Great price for a large container. Works well and smells good.</li>
    <li> This facial cream couldn&#x27;t work better. I apply it once a day before bed, and it absorbs quickly. It is important to remember the difference between lotion and cream. Lotion (usually comes out of a pump bottle) sits on your skin, and absorbs minimally. Cream (like this St. Ives  product) is water-based, and thus absorbs into your skin and moisturizes it much better. So I have always used creams. But with the collagen and elastin added into the cream, it makes it for a great anti-aging combo. And it is less than $4.00! I suggest using subscribe and save for extra savings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I subscribe to this about every 2 months, as that is about the time it takes for me to go thru a tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+ product!</li>
    <li> First of all, it is a BIG jar of moisturizer, should last you for a looooong time, because when I first tried it, I took just a finger full and it was too much, I was massaging it in forever! Hey I&#x27;m glad i just need to use a little and you get a whole lot. It smells good to me, gives me a kind of natural scent. I haven&#x27;t had the product long enough to know what it does for fine lines and wrinkles and building collagen yet, but so far I like it and it serves its main purpose of moisturizing and that is that.</li>
    <li> This stuff moisturizes very well, does not leave your skin greasy after putting it on.  Its very light wieght and a little bit goes a long way. Great deal for the size and It will last you a long time.  Hard to find in stores so I&#x27;m glad amazon carries it.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great product for legs and face.  Use frequently, so I like to buy this larger container on Amazon.  Lasts quite a long time.  Has a light, fresh fragrance and makes legs and face look and feel great!</li>
    <li> I started using this product about 3 months ago because I wanted to start moisturizing as more of a preventive measure. I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles yet. It keeps me reassured that my face is moisturized. I use it twice a day, when I wake up and when I go to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face does feel softer after using this, and my face does feel moisturized throughout the day without looking greasy or feeling heavy. I wear this under my suncreen, and using them both on my face still doesn&#x27;t give my face that greasy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is right on point, you really can&#x27;t beat it for the amount of product you receive either. It doesn&#x27;t take much to moisturize your entire face, so go lightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a good facial moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t waste your time, or money...this is it.</li>
    <li> Love this and the amount of cream that you get. Definitely worth the price. As far as results, I use this mostly for wrinkle prevention... as I am 25 and have very few wrinkles. It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok product, good for summer use when without sun exposure. Price is higher than walmart, which is about 10 dollars for 2 10 oz packs plus free shipping to home.</li>
    <li> Dear eSavvy:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time you ship any of beauty products, please be sure to seal it before you ship! This product was merely closed by its cap, which gave me a feeling that this is a used facial lotion!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell awful, and a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve used it several months now and never had any issue with it breaking out my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have very dry, sensitive skin and so many things break me out.  I need to use a moisturizer but would just deal with the dry skin because everything I tried broke me out, this does not.  My skin feels great after I use it.  I have to say that I just really love all of the St. Ives products, they work great for me.</li>
    <li> This item made me breakout BAD. Unfortunately I did not notice all of the ingredients which include an oil that my skin clearly does not appreciate.  Watch out for that if you have oily skin! Now I only use it on my hands and neck and NEVER on my face.</li>
    <li> I sure hope it the long-term effects are as great as the short-term. My skin is way softer in the am if I use this in the pm. And, there&#x27;s no parabens, it&#x27;s cruelty free and it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
    <li> I was searching for a moisturizer to quench my winter dry skin. I had tried a lot of moisturizers previous ranging from well known brands to the drug store brands. I had already loved St. Ives to begin with so thought it would be idea to try out the moisturizers for the face as well And I&#x27;m glad I did!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin soft&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin hydrated&lt;br /&gt;Works as a moisturizer should&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind the tub form but a pump is preferred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for making a amazing product!!! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different moisturizers and this is by far my favorite. It leaves my face looking refreshed without being greasy. I&#x27;ve even started to use it on my hands. The amount for the price is a great deal.</li>
    <li> An excellent moisturizer with Collagen. works even better that the high-price ones.&lt;br /&gt;Generous sized jar- for ample use.I highly recommend</li>
    <li> my skin feels softer and it seems to be working nicely. i use this creme daily and so does my boyfriend</li>
    <li> girl friend likes the product and the price is great</li>
    <li> Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Excellent company</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m SO jaded about buying any kind of moisturizer, even if marketed to people with \\&quot;sensitive skin.\\&quot;  Why?  Because usually, no matter how much I pay and what the company promises, my skin ends up burning, itching, or peeling. Not so with this; I&#x27;ve been using it daily for 3 weeks now and I have no redness, no burning, and no discomfort whatsoever.  This is a wonderfully effective, lightweight moisturizer that is not greasy at all.  It doesn&#x27;t interfere with foundation, doesn&#x27;t make your eyes \\&quot;burn\\&quot; later in the day, and just a dab does the job. Skin&#x27;s soft and smooth and this is one of the rare moisturizers that actually feels GOOD on my skin.  Most highly recommended; it&#x27;s a terrific value, especially through Subscribe &amp; Save!</li>
    <li> St.Ives is a real find. Priced right,too! Large 10oz jar,very moisturizing but feels light on the skin,not sticky or thick, with a nice soft scent. I have used it as a full body moisturizer and have found it esp.soothing to my normally dry legs. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer has been a personal favorite of my beautiful wife for a long time.....so, naturally, it has disappeared from most of our local retail outlets. I was delighted to find it on Amazon.com, at a reasonable price and readily available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer is light, refreshing but not heavy-handed in fragrance, absorbs easily, and helps keep my wife&#x27;s skin looking young and lovely. I hope St. Ives doesn&#x27;t stop producing it....I may have to stock up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual, ordering was simple, the product arrive properly packaged and in time to add to a basket of goodies for my bride&#x27;s birthday. Both the product and your service was and remains excellent.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by St Ives Facial Moisturizer since the product worked well on my sensitive skin.  It moisturizes and is not greasy. The product does not sting and does not stain.</li>
    <li> One of the best moisturizers out there. What&#x27;s great is that it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily like some other expensive brand names do and the price which can&#x27;t be beat. I use it in the morning and before I sleep and also purchased one for my mom and she loves it too. So, it works for all ages. How great is that?  I give it A+++.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for, can&#x27;t seem to find it in the stores any more. Very light weight.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best, I found it years ago and while I have tried other products here and there, they just don&#x27;t compare to this.  I use it all year long, no chapped cheeks in the winter and works well in warmer temps too.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s not greasy, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t have a scent.      The best of all a jar of this lasts me FOREVER, at least 6 months, likely more.  And I use it daily, sometimes more than once.  One of the best beauty bargains I have found hands down.  The only negative is that it&#x27;s not really easy to find, Walmart carries it, and perhaps some drugstores and beauty stores.    I am pleased to read that this product has been around for 20 years, which means discontinuation of it is unlikely.  At least I hope so, St. Ives has already discontinued or in the process of discontinued my beloved Clear Pore Cleanser, they better not get rid of this.    Overall, 5 plus stars.  Lots of people tell me that I look younger than my 36 years, who knows maybe this is my little beauty secret.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this product but as of late, cant find it anywhere. As always Amazon pulls through. Arrived in two days, look younger already!</li>
    <li> This cream works well. It really does moisturize and does not irritate my skin (I am very sensitive). It only takes a little cream, so it lasts a long time. The only downside, which is not necessarily the cream&#x27;s fault, is that it does clog the pores on my forehead so I can only use it for a few days at a time before switching to a different product to keep my skin clear.</li>
    <li> Smells Great, very light smell, doesn&#x27;t bother my husband. the lotion seems too light when I put it on but it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry after the lotion dries.  It&#x27;s perfect!!  So far I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks, I have not seen any real notice to any fine lines fading away or anything, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks. I love it I use it on my face, chest, shoulders because those are the areas that the sun has been beating on. I would use it all over but am trying to be conservative!</li>
    <li> I am on a low budget and this is a great product!  I will purchase this over and over again.</li>
    <li> Let me be honest...the only reason I bought this stuff was that I needed one more item to get the 15% discount for an Amazon subscription order.  So, I found this.  The reviews were pretty good and it was so cheap. I figured that at the very least, it would make a nice hand cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it was impossible (for me anyway) to grasp the concept of what 10 ounces of face cream looks like until I saw the jar.  Man!  I couldn&#x27;t help thinking about those tiny jars of creams I bought for $60+.  However, the amount doesn&#x27;t matter unless the stuff works - and St. Ives does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started wearing it under my make up and I am so surprised at how well it looks and keeps my make up looking fresh all day.  My make up used to look kind of draggy at the end of a long workday, but over St. Ives, it still looks amazingly good when I get home in the evening.  Most of all, my skin just feels really nice now.  Let me repeat that: with just a couple of uses, my skin feels much nicer now and holds that nice feeling all day.  Other creams worked great initially, but my skin lost the soft feeling during the day.  St. Ives works all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How is this possible with a vat of face cream which costs under $4?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a boomer who worshipped the sun in her younger days.  Although I have to say I sure enjoyed those carefree, uninformed days, it&#x27;s nice to find something to actually mitigate a little of what I did those years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess what my girfriends will be getting for Christmas!  What a find!</li>
    <li> This was getting more difficult in stores so very pleased I could buy on-line.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this cream.  It absorbs easily and feels wonderful.  You can&#x27;t beat it for the value and I use it all over, not just on my face because it feels so good!</li>
    <li> I have used it every day and never did any difference to my skin and container is almost finished yesterday.</li>
    <li> VERY NICE... we love it!</li>
    <li> This product is great. I have seen Dr Oz recommend this cream and also I did a survey about it.  It&#x27;s great. I have been using expensive creams on my face not really seeing any results.  I then purchased ROC @ amazon and loved it @ 15.00 a 5 oz tube.  This is equal to ROC in every way except for the price. I purchased from Amazon @ 9.95 a 10 oz jar.  It&#x27;s natural and not tested on animals which is what I prefer. I use most other St Ives products and never been unhappy. This one just got added to the list. The cream vanishes instantly into your skin. No heavy cream feeling that sits on your face. Love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading such great reviews and it was very afforadable. Especially with moisturizers, money does not alway equal chemistry with moisturize since everyone&#x27;s face has different need. After the first use I immediately liked this as its very light and a bit more luquid. Other moisturizers I&#x27;ve used (aveeno, up&amp;up, olay) have always been really thick and i feel like its suffocating my face and I like for it to breathe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not use too much, a little covers a lot. I use about a dime&#x27;s worth for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Light&lt;br /&gt;Long time moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way on skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Can slide off hands especially if you just used a serum on hands</li>
    <li> Works really well makes my face so moisturized and soft</li>
    <li> I use this ever day more than once I can put it on thick and it absorbs deep but is not sticky or greasy I really like the density and permeability of this product</li>
    <li> So, I started using this product because I like other products from St. Ives.  I do like the way my face feels and smells when I use it.  I have been hearing that this product has a lot of mineral oil in it, and that mineral oil doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin or really do anything beneficial for you.  Obviously, it is really cheap product and you get a lot of it.  It&#x27;s a good deal, but if it doesn&#x27;t work, then what is the point?  I will say that I use it as make-up remover, and that is works great for that! I also use it in the morning with sunscreen and wrinkle cream, so I&#x27;m using a lot of other products in conjunction with it.  This is my second jar of it, so I did buy it again because I always thought that it did moisturize, but I think I may try another product after reading so many harsh reviews.  Also I haven&#x27;t seen any visible results in it reducing fine lines or wrinkles at all.  I will finish the jar but browse other products when this product is gone because I&#x27;m not over the moon happy with it.</li>
    <li> I love this cream, it makes me face feel so good but it does make it feel oily!  The price it what is also amazing!</li>
    <li> I use this during the day. I bought it because it was such a good price, but I have to say I was very pleased to find how good it feels on my face; after  just a minutes or two, one can put powder on, or whatever else people plop upon their face. I thought it would feel gooey but it doesn&#x27;t. I consider it one of my cheaper good finds.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t need the timer or bouncer sheet.  Bouncer sheets less at sams club.  Everything else was great.thNks for everything elase</li>
    <li> The packaging is great. Mind you this moisturizer will last you months. Its really big.  and a small amount, twice a day , ur good to go. Im only 16 years old. and i know your probably thinking what the hell i dont need this. But looking at the crazy climates we have here in Connecticut, I dont want early wrinkles. And i heard collagen is really really really good for your skin so thats a plus for me. I&#x27;ll get back on my review after probably one month of using it. But so far i love this thing ! :)</li>
    <li> Love ... Love... I have very sensitive odd skin that hates all products not natural. I have had no complaints using this as a night moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I really love this moisturizer. I&#x27;m getting noticable results in a few days time. I love that it is light weight and not greasy with a light fragrance that doesnt overpower and it doesnt irritate my skin like other anti-aging moisturizers have in the past.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I have oily skin and I use this day and might and my face feels smooth and not oily. It&#x27;s very light and gives me a glow. :)</li>
    <li> Big jar! Works as stated &amp; less expensive than store bought.</li>
    <li> I saw this on dr oz!! I thought I would give it a try, we&#x27;ll let me tell u!! It&#x27;s feels like ur putting grease on ur face and it was very lumpy and all like water!! It smelled strong like perfum!! So I don&#x27;t think this has the stuff it says it does!!</li>
    <li> Enough facial moisturizer for the neighborhood or a few lifetimes.  Non greasy, smells great.  Hope they never realize what a treasure this is and charge 100x the amount for the bountiful jar.</li>
    <li> the jar is too big and i think it&#x27;s too much for the face. i&#x27;m afraid it will get dry or it will loose some of its properties, or something like that. anyway, i love the smell and it works very good for the skin of my face. not too oily, its ok.</li>
    <li> I like using this product.  It feels great on my skin and the fragrance is appealing.  I use it daily and like the results I have seen so far.</li>
    <li> This is a great basic face moisturizer, undoes the drying from my face cleanser. Note that it&#x27;s lavender, which is normally a pleasant smell. This makes you smell like a grandma, but the smell fades after about five minutes. Be warned.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years now. Mostly on my face in the morning. It&#x27;s the only product i use!</li>
    <li> This product works good!! My skin felt soft within using it only a couple of days and I saw a difference.</li>
    <li> I like the way this feels. Doesn&#x27;t break out face, no powerful smell. I really like this product. Very affordable.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this as a great buy, not greasy at all, preformed as well as any high priced wonder cream I bought over the past year&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this</li>
    <li> As soon as I put on this creme, it tingled my face. It hasn&#x27;t stung my eyes yet. It is very light and absorbs well. I sense no oiliness.</li>
    <li> I admire them for it soft and do not cause allergies, as well as many quantity and moisten skin and if the opportunity arises ... bought them again</li>
    <li> St. Ives Facial Moisturizer, Timeless Skin Collagen Elastin, 10oz  it&#x27;s very cheap,but the function is good ,i think it worthful</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite face lotion that I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different ones, but for the price, this is the best! I put it on every night and wake up with my face feeling so fresh and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Love this! I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days, but my skin is so soft. A great product.</li>
    <li> wonderful product.  I have been using other skin moisturizers, and they seem to make my skin super oily towards mid-day.  Even though this one is moisturizing, it seeps into the skin and just makes it glow from within, and its soooo much cheaper than the other ones I have been using.  I cant believe the benefits from this one vs the more pricey version.  It&#x27;s lovely texture, good smell - not strong, but very light and fresh. You cannot go wrong here.</li>
    <li> Very easily absorbed into the skin.  Doesn&#x27;t leave a residue at all, just smoothing and clean.</li>
    <li> This product is worth every penny and more. Keeps my skin moisturized and soft. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;-You&#x27;re getting a lot of product here. Used on my face and neck only, this tub could easily last me well over 6 months&lt;br /&gt;-Pleasant smell. Not too cloying or perfumey&lt;br /&gt;-Mild and non-irritating. Keep in mind that I don&#x27;t have super-sensitive skin, though. Your results may vary&lt;br /&gt;-Absorbs into skin rather quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;-No plastic tab between product and lid, which makes it a bit messy to use&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t do anything special. My skin isn&#x27;t glowing and I haven&#x27;t noticed any dramatic improvements&lt;br /&gt;-Moisturizing properties are rather mild. If you have very dry skin it&#x27;s probably not a good option&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is good for people who want a lot of moisturizer for a cheap price. I bought this as an alternative to Oil of Olay, etc. and I think I&#x27;m going to pay a bit more for the good stuff and use this as a body moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Recommended on Dr. Oz show!&lt;br /&gt;Certainly cannot beat the price for a moisturizing cream. Will last for a long time. Just hope it works as they say on TV!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased because the product arrived fast.  Also, the product was exactly what I was expecting to receive.</li>
    <li> This has to be the easiest and most beneficial cream I have ever bought - goes on smoothly and sinks in to the skin- never leaves a greasy look. No sign of any reaction like sometimes happens with even more expensive creams. This is for me and it is reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> This product does sink right into your skin but calling it &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; is a stretch. To me, a cream stays in the jar if you turn it upside down like Jason&#x27;s 25,000 IU Vitamin E cream does. This would just fall or run out instantly it&#x27;s so thin.&lt;br /&gt; The scent is perfect. That is, it has a faint scent of soap. Smelling it you feel super clean. It&#x27;s also great in hot weather since it&#x27;s so cold.&lt;br /&gt;  There is nothing that is objectionable about this product . Time will tell if it helps dry, rough skin. I&#x27;ve limited its use to my face. And the price is fabulous.</li>
    <li> My face loves it. Best facial  moisturizer I  ever used.</li>
    <li> Have not used it long enough to know how good it is.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad they still make this, albeit now in different packaging.  It&#x27;s is much better than more expensive products - doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling, no heady scent, and most importantly, it works!</li>
    <li> great cream for after washing face. skin fills soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this stuff!! Huge container. Good buy for price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for over a year now and it has worked great. It&#x27;s not super heavy, not sticky, and keeps me moisturized throughout the day. Just a little bit goes a long way. I use it at night after washing off makeup, and in the morning prior to putting on makeup. My skin has looked the best it ever has. Days when I don&#x27;t feel like doing full makeup, I combine a little foundation will about a fingertip full of cream and it works great as a homemade tinted moisturizer. I used to be able to find it at drugstores, but they seems to stop having it in stock. I would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is wonderful. I hydrate my skin without that oily feeling. I&#x27;m happy to hear that Dr. Oz even recommends too. The only issue I now have now is keeping it in stock. My husband found it and he used it one day and loved it.  He never could find that perfect lotion, the kind that would heal his terribly dry hands...until now. We own a pest control company so his hands are in chemicals all the time, plus the cold &amp; hot weather here in Oklahoma does not help so his hands are always dry and cracked. I highly recommend...get it on Subscribe &amp; Save so you never run out...Great price too, can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> I found this very greasy.  I like lotions that rub in, like Aveeno.  Ended up throwing this whole jar away.</li>
    <li> I use this very often, and it leaves the skin really soft.  I love the fact that it is so cheap.  I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> I love this light watery cream but the only problem is out of the 6 I ordered, 5 were at about two thirds filled and 1&lt;br /&gt;of the creams was only half the jar full. It seem the creams had evaporated.&lt;br /&gt;I have bought this cream in the past and the jar was always full of cream to the top.  Unfortunately the ones I received were not full,&lt;br /&gt;I found and inside crack after I used one jar completely.</li>
    <li> Smells nice. I use it on my hands to keep them looking young. Moisturizing but not oily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year and a half and love it! A little goes a long way. This moisturizer will last you a good year. Makes your skin feel amazing and doesn&#x27;t make you breakout, etc.</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer consistently for a few years now. Its the only one I can rely on for moisture in the winter that wont give out on me, as well as in the summer without weighing me down. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot. I slather it on myself after a shower and stay moisturized all day. And the price? A steal!</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite moisturizer! I have normal to dry skin in the winter and it doesn&#x27;t make my face oily. Sometimes I will rub a little on my hands when putting it on while I am out if I forgot my hand lotion. You only need a little bit of this so it lasts all year for me (don&#x27;t use on hot days).</li>
    <li> I love this product. They have recently replaced the packaging and I have looked in every store locally without success. I was delighted to find it on Amazon. I had bought 2 other top name brands and it felt like I put grease on my face. The minute you apply this it is a part of your skin. The price even with shipping was less than either of the other two.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin feeling nourished and clean. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a facial lotion, especially if you suffer from dry skin.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely amazed! I admit, I used this product for something other than my face. I had a baby 6 months ago. I had gained a LOT of weight during my pregnancy due to a medical condition that caused me to retain dangerous amounts of water. The skin on my stomach had stretched so bad during pregnancy my skin was not just stretching but tearing. It took me 6 weeks to loose all my weight, and I was left with horrifying loose skin on my tummy, literally I had am appointment scheduled with a laser center for July 20th because of my insecurity and my issue with this extra skin getting pinched in zippers, \\&quot;sorry for the gross details\\&quot; I decided to try this product on my stomach 2 weeks ago, because of my husbands strong objection to me going under a laser..... I can&#x27;t believe the difference already. Not only is my skin very noticeably retracted, but my skins is as soft as my daughters!</li>
    <li> I noticed a visible difference with my skin in the first week. Definite reduction in wrinkles. I use it on my hands as well. Best overall facial moisturizer I have ever used and  you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of St. Ives products and this is by far my favorite. Moving to this product from heavier ones like Cetaphil and Cera Vie is like night and day in terms of how greasy my skin feels and looks after application. On my face a modest application of St. Ives &#x27;soaks in&#x27; promptly and leaves my face looking moisturized without a sheen or any greasiness to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this moisturizer is so light compared to the thicker, heavier creams and since I do have dry-ish skin, my approach these days is to use St. Ives after my morning routine and apply Cera Vie in the evening to take advantage of its substantialness at a time when I&#x27;m not concerned about how my face looks. This is especially handy in the winter when central heat and winter wind add a lot of dryness.</li>
    <li> To me, this is the perfect face cream. It leaves the skin soft and moisterized, and I like the price as well.&lt;br /&gt; I am glad I still can find it online.</li>
    <li> I liked the product very much. It&#x27;s better than other moisturizer I was using. I would recomend this to my friends</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, for this price, but I am still disappointed in this &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34;.  First it has a very &amp;#34;whipped&amp;#34; consistency- first two ingredients are water and mineral oil. Not surprisingly, it does not feel like it penetrates the skin at all, but just sits on the surface.  I was expecting something that actually moisturized the skin, but this product does not.  It&#x27;s not at all like any of the oil of olay or avon or Mary Kay products. It claims to &amp;#34;reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles&amp;#34;, and since I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, I can&#x27;t speak to that.  But for a low-priced simple face moisturizer, I&#x27;d still stick with Oil of Olay beauty fluid (Amazon has a pretty good price on that).  Maybe I&#x27;ll use the rest of this tub for a body lotion after I get out of the shower.</li>
    <li> I wear this at night but mostly during the day before putting on make-up. I&#x27;ve used tons of creams but for this price and the job that it does - I&#x27;m SOLD.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite moisturizer hands down.  After just week my skin looks and feels softer.</li>
    <li> Absorbs quickly for super soft skin. Not sure about how well it eliminates fine lines though. :( It is great for just a moisturizer though!</li>
    <li> I read about this product on the Maskcara beauty blog and I absolutely LOVE it!  It glides on very light and non-greasy, yet provides excellent hydration. I even love using it in the back of my hands because it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy, heavy layer, yet as light as it is, it really protects them from excessive winter chapping.  It smells so clean and absolutely fantastic, too.</li>
    <li> as described fast shipping</li>
    <li> made my skin break out because of the perfume in it</li>
    <li> Just as described. Thank you. Great shipping A++++</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. It is so thick and creamy, and smells really nice. I use it at night before I go to bed, and it moisturizes so well. I have pretty dry skin but also break-out prone, and this doesn&#x27;t break me out. I&#x27;m only 23, so I can&#x27;t say when it comes to the anti-aging (I got the anti-aging one just to prevent wrinkles and such, not treat them), but everything else is great. I definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I use this product every night before bed time.</li>
    <li> My skin is noticeably firmer. Glad it is because you can&#x27;t beat the price for the size. I will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> I used to like this product as an inexpensive moisturizer. I wasn&#x27;t too concerned about lines yet (and noticed no effect on the few I do have), but I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten this product for lines anyway: collagen molecules are too big to be absorbed through the skin, so it is really irrelevant whether collagen is included in a cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is relevant to me is that St Ives used to not test on animals, and now they do. I won&#x27;t contribute to pain and suffering, animal or human.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many choices out there from companies that do not test on animals. My new way to go is to sign up for \\&quot;The Body Shop\\&quot; emails and stock up when they have a 40% sale. I like the company because they (a) oppose animal testing and (b) hold fundraisers to stop human trafficking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, their lotions are a bit too expensive for me to get when they aren&#x27;t on sale. But there are a number of other companies out there that oppose cruelty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan of some of PETA actions, but if you search for \\&quot;PETA companies that don&#x27;t test on animals,\\&quot; they have a helpful webpage that will give you options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: decent moisturizer, ineffective on lines, contributes to animal cruelty, going another way.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer I have ever found. Sinks in, feels great, lasts and the price is phenomenal.</li>
    <li> This is the best cream! I use it all of the time not just for face but for body as well.</li>
    <li> Will buy this item again. Makes dry winter skin feel soft again. Restores to a more younger and youthful look and feel.</li>
    <li> I truely like this product and it is inexpensive.  It keeps your skin moistured through the night without the greese. I deffinitely would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Nice, gentle moisturizer. If your skin is oily this one is perfect for you. It is really light and I think i will use it as a day time moisturizer. I love the smell too. Smells like grass early in the morning after the rain.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a few days, my skin does feel very soft and it has a pleasant smell. My fine lines are less noticeable, so far so good i like it! I have used St. Ives products before never had a problem with the product line. The size of this moisturizer is great it will last a while and it was delivered on time. I am a happy customer. Will very likely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have acne and dry/oily skin i bought this because the olay kind wasn&#x27;t working for me any more and i used cetaphil but it started to leave my skin looking to shinny and they both cost $10 or more and i wanted to try something else that was cheaper since i use moisturizer morning and night  so i bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read that some people on here said it gave them breakouts or some other kind of skin problem i have really&lt;br /&gt;sensitive skin, i get rashes from pretty much anything that is really perfume smelling, so i have to watch what i put on&lt;br /&gt;my skin. This moisturizer has been great for me its the best moisturizer i have found that you can buy at the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week of using it my skin is softer it isn&#x27;t as dry or oily and my breakouts have gotten a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell its a light fresh smell not to overpowering like olay i don&#x27;t like face creams that have a strong&lt;br /&gt;smell i rather it not have a smell at all but this stuff after it dries on my skin i don&#x27;t smell it which is a good thing for me&lt;br /&gt;because i don&#x27;t want to go around smelling like a face cream all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a great product for the price and size i don&#x27;t know if it really has helped with my fine lines since im 27 i don&#x27;t really&lt;br /&gt;have a big problem with that yet but it has made my skin look better so that&#x27;s why i gave it 4 stars and not 5 because i know&lt;br /&gt;its made for fine lines but i haven&#x27;t noticed any difference with that on my face but i 27 so im young enough to not have to worry about that problem yet but i will one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So i think if your thinking about trying this out then do its under $5 if it doesn&#x27;t work for your face it would be a great hand cream.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see how this product could break people out but everyone skin is different and everybody&#x27;s skin reacts to things differently so for me most of the time skin creams make me itch,burn or they make my skin break out more or makes my skin really dry or more oily and this product is the only kind i have tried that really has worked and made my skin problems better with every use.his product is the only kind i have tried that really has worked and made my skin problems better with every use.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a moisturizer to make your skin look moist, I recommend this product. It is really cheap and frankly without becoming an expert I would doubt anything is much better. It isn&#x27;t oily and has an inoffensive smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for approximately 20 years and I recommend it very highly; it goes on smoothly, it has a subtle/clean scent and it&#x27;s very effective.  I also think the price is quite reasonable and each jar lasts for quite awhile.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it was by far the cheapest moisturizer I could find. My face feels very dry after I wash it, and my nose gets dry and flaky in the winter, so a good moisturizer is a necessity. This one works great: it makes my skin more comfortable after washing and prevents peeling around my nose. I don&#x27;t experience any irritation from it either. I can&#x27;t really comment on the firming effect because I am 22, but I don&#x27;t really notice a difference in the appearance of my skin compared to when I have used other moisturizers. Overall, it works well for what I need it for.</li>
    <li> This lotion is lightweight, absorbs right away. Not heavy at all. Makes skin super soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell is nice - not too overwhelming at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using for about a year, I have sensitive skin - I use this mainly in the winter or other seasons after getting a lot of sun and or wind. Usually lotion makes me break out, this has not.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my twenties but I have bad skin. Scattered pimples, big old pores, dry, etc. I&#x27;ve used this in conjunction with [[ASIN:B0025N244K Avon Moisture Therapy Intensive Hand Cream for Extremely Dry Skin]] to clear up the pimples and my face has never looked better. This absorbs into your skin really well and you almost forget that you have it applied. Not only is it a great product, the 10 ounce jar is pretty huge and will probably last me 6 months.</li>
    <li> A friend introduced products. Unable to hold oneself back to buy, use after a period of time, feel the skin is very moist. To buy some for my friends, they are very loving.</li>
    <li> its the best moisturizer out there. i have tried tons of moisturizers from $20- $200 and this tops them all. Highly recommend it.   TIP: If you want to make is anti-aging add a pea size retin-A cream to the amount of cream you will apply to your face at nighttime and you will see WONDERS.</li>
    <li> Smells great, and when I wake up in the morning my face is super soft. Very light moisturizer, not greasy, doesn&#x27;t clog pores, and great to use all the time.</li>
    <li> This moisturer has some good reviews so I thought I would try it!  I did not see any results and did not like the feel.  I would not buy again!</li>
    <li> Absorbs well and is not too greasy. The smell is light and it really helps in the dry weather. I will buy it again!</li>
    <li> My wife was very dissappointed that the local stores did not always carry this.&lt;br /&gt;she loves it and I know I can always get it here.</li>
    <li> A bit heavy for my skin, and too much fragrance. I&#x27;ll pass on this one! May be more for younger skin.</li>
    <li> Here is the recipe to my cocktail: Take one of those dollar store/ target spray bottles. Fill it half way with St Ives Facial Moisturizer, Timeless Skin Collagen Elastin and 1/4 of the bottle with Retinol Cream (Vitamin A 100,000 Iu Per Ounce) - 2 Oz and 10-15 drops of Lactic Acid 70% Gel Peel and voila... watch all that in the bottle turn into beautiful liquid that can be used via spray bottle. Pros of using this method is you get the best of all worlds, easier to use rather than opening up multiple bottles/ containers and it does not require contact of your germ ridden hands over your face for an easy, smooth, even application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For results I would have to come back to this review in a few months because I just start using this twice a day for about 2 weeks now.</li>
    <li> I like how this cream leaves my skin feeling soft.  I use this as a body cream and not as a facial moisturizer as I have oily skin, but I find that it helps to firm the skin, and the price of this product is unreal for a cream that seems to work out for me.  It does have a slight fragrance which doesn&#x27;t take away from any perfume I wear that day.</li>
    <li> This was amazingly inexpensive and does a good job of moisturing the skin on dry winter days. As far as I can tell it does nothing to minimize fine lines/wrinkles around my eyes. It has no odor and is not at all greasy.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t really do anything positive for my skin, but it works for my little sister who has dry skin.</li>
    <li> Only used it a few times but it seems to be doing the trick.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, I have been buying high end (Obagi) for years! My daughter got this first and I tried it after hearing her glowing comments, needless to say I stopped using my product and now use this.</li>
    <li> Love St Ives other products but not so happy with this cream. Great size for the price but I can feel it on my face after it has absorbed.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin and this works great.  It is light and makes my skin feel soft.  It&#x27;s great at night and under make-up.  I would give it 5 stars, but when i wash my face I feel it like a layer on my skin.  I do love that all the ingredients (for the most part) I can pronounce and they are not extensive.  Naturally derived.  Also no parabens!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my face break out a bit. So I use it on my neck, chest, and hands after a shower. It usually doesn&#x27;t break me out on my chest. So, I give it two stars because I&#x27;ll never use this on my face.</li>
    <li> I know this got good reviews and I was definitely interested, Until I received it and saw all the oil&#x27;s in it. Just not for me or my face , and maybe I didn&#x27;t read the description well enough. It does have a cold cream smell about it.  It is a huge jar, so a definite value. Just not for me.</li>
    <li> I use this + a vitamin C &amp; hyaluronic acid serum - and my skin is perfect. I&#x27;ll use this for the next few decades at least!!!</li>
    <li> When I saw all the great reviews about this product, I really wanted to like it because the price was perfect for my budget. However, my face started to break out on day one. It was like my old teenage days. Horrible. I&#x27;m jealous of the people who can actually use it because it feels good to the skin and it smells good. But it is definitively not good for my type of skin :(</li>
    <li> I really really wanted to love this. I had a positive attitude because of all the 5 star reviews and the price, who could be disappointed with the price for the amount of moisturizer you get. It would be like hitting the lottery if it worked. After not finding it at ULTA, CVS, or Target, I bought the last 2 jars at Wal-Mart. Still it was under $10 bucks. It seemed to be fine the first couple days I used it but then I started to feel little bumps all over my face and then blackheads and pimples started popping up. I wanted to blame it on my makeup or laundry detergent, anything but this miracle face cream. But denial will only get you more blackheads. YIKES are you kidding me. It states that it is non-comedigenic and dematoligist tested. What the heck. I did experience the dry flaky skin issue on the sides of my face as well. Still don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m going to keep it for my feet and legs. I guess if it seems to good to be true it probabl is. : - (</li>
    <li> WELL, I USED IT AS DAY CREAM AND IT LAST ME EXACLY ONE YEAR!!!! MY SKIN LOOK BETTER AND THE SMELL IS  WONDERFUL. I WAS SAD WHEN I FINISH IT . AND THE PRICE IS INCREDIBLE TOO. I LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> This has a really strong perfume smell.  After a couple of weeks of use, I see no changes.  I&#x27;m willing to keep using to see if it has any impact. Good news is that it doesn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive skin that can get red and dry quite easily.</li>
    <li> I stopped using this for a while but just recently stated again and it is a good moisturizer, especially for the price</li>
    <li> I really like this cream. It seems to work better than the more expensive creams I have purchased in the past. It makes my face feel nice and not greasy at all. I can see an improvement in my skin and I haven&#x27;t been using it very long. I would recommend it to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I have very oily skin but I still put this on in the morning along with my make up and have received so many complements about how nice my skin and make up looks.</li>
    <li> I tried this product after an acne regimen and a \\&quot;Complete\\&quot; spf 15 moisturizer dried my skin out so badly that my skin was peeling. I honestly think the moisturizer caused the biggest problem because since I switched to St Ives moisturizer I haven&#x27;t had a problem with drying from the acne system. Actually the opposite, now my skin is nearly clear and softer than its been in a long time. This product has a nice clean smell and its not greasy or heavy. The \\&quot;Complete\\&quot; moisturizer took a long time to rub in but this just absorbs very quickly. It has no spf and I couldn&#x27;t care less because I stay out of the sun anyway. Buy this here or at Walmart like I did and you won&#x27;t be sorry. Its really a great product.</li>
    <li> Great and simple product.  My daughter&#x27;s  skin is very sensitive and before this product, she spent loads of money on expensive products but continued having breakouts. I gave her mine to use and she loved it and does not irritate her skin and it looks so much clearer.  She uses minimal facial products and minimal makeup, so her sensitive skin is not abused, so it&#x27;s nice finding something finally that works for her.  And I like it because it hydrates well and I use it under makeup, waiting for it to soak in before applying.  We first started using it after seeing Dr. Oz recommend this as a good and simple product to be using.</li>
    <li> Excellent seller.Like to do business again.Excellent damage against sun&#x27;s harmful rays.Keeps the skin smooth and vibrant.used more oftenQuality is awesome</li>
    <li> This is a good feeling moisturizer which goes on smoothly.  It is easy to apply makeup over it.  I would order this again, but wish I could purchase it locally.</li>
    <li> Dr Oz was right this stuff works just as well as more expensive brands. I have been using it for over a year now. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This is the best value for a night cream anywhere.  Save your money and don&#x27;t buy expensive stuff you don&#x27;t need.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is a very inexpensive moisturizer but it it highly effective.I heard about it on a daytime TV show and gave it a try.Works great! I used to be able to get it locally but when I could no longer find it I went to Amazon and I get it on auto delivery,so I never run out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good moisturizer. I&#x27;m not sure if it helps or it was just my imagination, but i think it does do something for (very) fine lines. (Though maybe the whole rubbing it in thing was actually it...) I got it much cheaper at my local drugstore (around $4). The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it makes me break out a bit (a zit or two) when i use it a few days in a row. Still, overall, a good item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 6/10/13&lt;br /&gt;Been using it for a while now. No longer have issues with breaking out. Maybe I just needed to get used to it. Great, lightweight moisturizer. Dries quickly and does not leave my face greasy. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> loved this product,solf, left my skin and neck so solf and skin is beauitful. I also purchased Palmer stick, great for dark sports . peggie&lt;br /&gt;This was so hard to do</li>
    <li> I love the smell and feel of this product. I don&#x27;t use make up so this on my face is nice to smooth it on those dry days. I purchased it from Amazon b/c I couldn&#x27;t find it at Walmart anymore. Then I also found it at drugstore.com but it came in a 2 pack. Some times you just don&#x27;t want a 2pk. I will keep using this product as long as it&#x27;s available. :)</li>
    <li> This is an excellent moisturizer that I would highly recommend. It works great, after using it my face is very moisturized, soft and smooth. And this is a large tub so I will last a good while, love it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product year ago, glad I found it again, for the price couldn&#x27;t ask for a better moisturizer</li>
    <li> this is the best moisterizer in the world, not only is it nice mositerizer, it has the most delicious fresh smell, I love putting it on. I highly recommend it  for under makeup or at night to stay hydrated. I give this product 5*</li>
    <li> I really helped my dry skin during the summer so I continued to use it and one day I noticed I had several little white hard bumps.  Thought they were white heads but after using a 10X  magnifier mirror I could see that they were solid bumps.  I stopped using the cream and pierced the white bumps with a small sewing needle and used a mask several times to clear them up.  Took a while but they disappeared.  Now I have started using cream again slowly but notice the bumps are coming back so I am lost.  I love the moisturizing effect of the cream but hate dealing with the cysts, so I use less then I would like and really need more because my skin is not nearly as soft as I is with a daily use of the product.</li>
    <li> I was super tired of paying $3 every month at the local Dollar Store for face cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works just as well, if not better than Olay products.</li>
    <li> Great Moisturizer for the price!! I use it every day.  I will definitely be buying more at this price.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t complain love the price and keeps my face from breaking out. Second time I order and this time I added oils I bought here in Amazon such as bio oil and hyaluronic oil, just experimenting.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth.  Absorbs and leaves my skin feeling smooth and relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat the price...especially compared to the high end moisturizer used prior.&lt;br /&gt;Love!</li>
    <li> Upon application face looked moisturized, but after a few weeks I had facial dry spots.&lt;br /&gt;I will not recommand to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this. Great moisturizer and it smells so fresh and clean too. My husband shaves his head and yesterday he got a bad sunburn. I gave him some of this and he really liked it. Said it soothed that burn. He&#x27;ll continue to put it on so he doesn&#x27;t get peeling skin.</li>
    <li> I have never reviewed an item I purchased from Amazon and I purchase something about once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many others that commented, I have SO many skin products piled up from trial and error. I have spent hundreds of dollars on moisturizers. Chanel, Proactiv, Aveeno, Clinique...EVERY brand out there - I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gone through three rounds of accutane, so needless to say my skin is prone to acne and extremely sensitive. I was concerned about ordering this because how could something so cheap not break me out and work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT WORKS. IT SERIOUSLY works. I have had zero breakouts, my skin tone looks even and it feels so soft. I really love the light fragrance too. I feel refreshed when I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seriously recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Just works great. the whole family uses.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this moisturizer. Goes on smooth and non-greasy--nice smell too. I would buy this again and again for sure.</li>
    <li> I hoped it would make a difference but I actually didnt see any results almost 4 weeks after using it. It may be the type of skin that I have.&lt;br /&gt;I had to use another cream after applying this one after a while because I felt complete dryness.</li>
    <li> I have never liked to use lotion for my face. I have to now that i have two bottles.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is light, not heavy. Very easy to wear under makeup. Does not make my skin look greasy. It was actually a good buy. It will b a long time before i run out. Would buy again when i do.</li>
    <li> I liked using this cream.  It left my skin soft and fully moisturized.  I find it to be a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Feels nice on skin, and makes my face feel smoother.It also has a nice smell. I will be looking for more products.</li>
    <li> Saw this on Dr. Oz and gave it a try.  Dr. Oz recommended this as an alternative to high priced wrinkle lotions.  It goes on easy, tightens, and moistens the skin.</li>
    <li> It is a great moisturizer and it&#x27;s a huge jar so it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> i use it daily. ordered two jars. recommended to others. clean and fresh feel. great price point.  will order again.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I am very satisfied</li>
    <li> This used to be a great product, until Unilever bought it from St Ives and changed the formula. I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t helping my skin the way it used to, so I checked the label again. That&#x27;s when I realized that the ingredients have changed, along with the manufacturer. It&#x27;s worthless now.</li>
    <li> Since this product is specified for face, I imagined the container much smaller than it actually was. The lotion is smooth and light with a subtle fragrance, and there&#x27;s so much of it I find myself using it for body, as well as face. Shipping was lightening fast also</li>
    <li> Hydrates my skin very well and really reduces the redness. I love this, it&#x27;s effective!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think it did a great job and personally it irritates my face, I wouldn&#x27;t order it again, I now use it for my hands just so I don&#x27;t waste it.</li>
    <li> I have used Physicians Formula collagen products for years and loved them. Thought I&#x27;d give St. Ives a try again (used to be a devotee of their original apricot scrub in the 80s). This product disappoints, but it may well be a result of arriving unsealed. I had to throw it out.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new moisturizer and thought St. Ives would be a good choice.  I love the facial scrub.  So sad to find out that St. Ives tests on animals.  I will now be looking for a new scrub.  Very disappointing St. Ives!!</li>
    <li> Works well and nice for me. I like putting it on my face during the night, it makes my skin feel soft and nourished.</li>
    <li> I love St. Ives! This product works great! Great price and will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I have used it for a few months now, I really like it! It makes my face soft and does not irritate my skin or cause acne. I&#x27;m 21 but can never be too young to start taking care of your skin!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Best moisturizer ever.</li>
    <li> I have large pores and oily skin and have been looking for light moisturizer to use under make-up that is paraben free and this works great!!  I just use a little under make-up and that is all I need and does not get greasy (again I just use a very small amount.)  It also doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and cause breakouts.  And it is such a great price you can slather it on when you are feeling dry or need a beauty boost.  Use it on your chest area as well.  Excellent product and so glad paraben free!</li>
    <li> if you have very sensitive skin, it may not work for you. it did dissolve well but left skin with blemishes</li>
    <li> So I normally love cetaphil because it&#x27;s fragrance free, but once you hit a warm spell in winter--yes, it even happens in blizzard city where I live--you need something light. Not that cetaphil lotion can&#x27;t be layered thin, but this one seems to glide on smoothly and absorb very fast. That&#x27;s a plus for makeup days. I used it as a total body lotion tonight. I still wish it had no scent and came in small bottles for transport, while I keep a tub home, but all in all my skin feels soft and smooth. They did change the formula, so in a few days I might switch. However, right now as I type this minor manifesto, it feels pretty nice. I think the smell can be overlooked under certain conditions. And for reference, my skin is medium light, not prone to breakouts or blemishes, I don&#x27;t use base or foundation and don&#x27;t sunbathe. So when I have really good skin days, it&#x27;s not the powder or blush working. Gonna see if this stands up to my skin test.</li>
    <li> moisturizes my face and keeps it smooth and soft.  Excellent moisturizer and softener.  I didn&#x27;t like &amp;#34;collagen&amp;#34; in my body products because my body is not very friendly with any kind of animal product; but this collagen on this product is from Cod fish.  I called St. Ives customer service and they confirmed with me.  :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me, but this facial lotion doesn&#x27;t feel very effective. I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now, but my skin still gets flaky in some spots. It&#x27;s a decent lotion especially for the price, but I wouldn&#x27;t rave about this product. Would I buy it again? Sure, it gets the job done. But, if my budget allowed it, I&#x27;d splurge for something more moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This is the best face cream around.  There is no need to spend a fortune on face cream because this is the best.  I&#x27;ve been using it for two years now and I can really tell the difference.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve used it as a facial moisturizer consistently for ten years. I started when I was 18 and am now turning 28. I really feel as if my face has scarcely aged at all in those ten years. Of course, I have used many other products during this time, but always in conjunction with St. Ives Collagen and Elastin moisturizer. This product works extremely well as a light facial moisturizer at night (use an SPF 15 product during the day) or just slather it all over your face like I do at night, and let the moisture sink in for a couple hours. This stuff will make your skin look like brand new!  It&#x27;s also a great acne remedy, believe it or not. It will make your acne clear up.</li>
    <li> Awesome face moisturizer and they give you a super good amount. Should last me a long time. Smells and feels Great!</li>
    <li> This is a great product but it slightly breaks me out. I would recommend this for anyone that has normal skin.</li>
    <li> This cream is AMAZBALLS!  The jar is huge and such a great price!  It is nice and thick, goes on easily and absorbs completely.  For the review that suggests too much fragrance, I disagree.  The scent is very light, I can hardly smell it at all.  Nice!</li>
    <li> does nothing to moisturize the skin. i&#x27;ve used a huge amount of this, rubbed it into my skin and it made no difference in the dryness. i&#x27;d rather use coconut oil to moisturize even though I hate the smell. I didn&#x27;t give this 1 star because it&#x27;s so cheap for such a large quantity. It&#x27;s probably my own fault for falling for it.</li>
    <li> It absorbs very quickly and skin feels great, works superb for under the makeup. Can&#x27;t beat the price and size.</li>
    <li> My st. Ives cream arrived broken with the cream all over the inside of thr mailing bag. It should have been mailed in a mailing box. So what is the next step? Heima gordon</li>
    <li> I just started using this cream and noticed a big difference in my face and hands.  It certainly minimized the winkles and smoothed the skin on my hands.  They look years younger, they were starting to look like my mom&#x27;s hands. The skin on my face is a lot softer I really didn&#x27;t have a lot of winkles on my face to make a noticeable difference.  That is why I want to prevent more from happening.  The cream is affordable compared to many I have tried in the past.  I have not noticed the smell as previous people have but it certainly doesn&#x27;t smell like bath and body works either.  But I didn&#x27;t buy it for the smell.</li>
    <li> Good product, economical, I use it liberally on my neck .</li>
    <li> This comes in a large jar and is therefore inexpensive. It goes on in a way that I say is like a creamy oil. It feels great going on, makes the skin feel moist and smooth. My girlfriend likes it for that reason too (we are 57 and 63). However, after a few minutes I see no real benefit. It feels like I haven&#x27;t put anything on and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel or look any different. So other than the the way it feels going on I can&#x27;t see any use for it.</li>
    <li> I am a 26 year old male. Several weeks ago I was at the checkout line in Wal Mart and the woman at the checkout line told me I looked like I was about 32. I felt absolutely awful. Although I had a beard that clearly needed to be shaven off, I was shocked that she really thought I was THAT old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had noticed that my skin had not been looking as good over the past several years but thought it may have been the minoxidil I was using for hair loss, which can sometimes cause reduced collagen production in the face. In terms of a face moisturizer, I used to either use just a general skin cream that is not meant for the face, and that would often just make it look oily, or nothing at all. I went on Amazon to try to look at some reviews for different face moisturizers, and ultimately I decided on this one. It had so many positive reviews and was very cheap, so I thought what the hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several weeks later and my skin really looks better than it has in years! Rather than looking oily, my mom commented that my skin now looked like it had a &amp;#34;glow.&amp;#34; I would most certainly agree. It feels soften than ever, especially right after I shave when it is truly just silky soft. And the few fine lines and other imperfections that I have are much less visible. I feel like I actually look my age! I don&#x27;t put much on when I use it, but it is not something that makes my skin look oily, only healthy and vibrant, so I don&#x27;t hesitate. This is of course after washing my face with regular soap in the shower thoroughly, after which a moisturizer is in order anyhow. It does not seem to cause me any acne or increased black heads either. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer.  When I use it on my dry hands, they instantly become smooth and moisturized, and they retain moisture for a long time.  However, this product is certainly comedogenic and made me break out when I applied it to my face.  It would probably be a good facial moisturizer for people who are not acne prone.  But for the price, I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
    <li> I love the feeling of this lotion on my skin, it&#x27;s not too heavy and it&#x27;s not too light. It feels smooth and my skin is much hydrated now. I don&#x27;t need to use much either so this one is going to last me a very long time.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied With a very comfortable I have been using St Ives products since I was 35, I am now 61. Love, Love Love them!!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat it for the cost. My face always feels fresh, it&#x27;s not heavy.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get the hype on this moisturizer. I had read on a few different blogs that this product was comparable to more expensive moisturizers. It&#x27;s unbelieveably cheap, but it just made my skin greasy and made me break out. (I have oily but sensitive skin.) I much prefer Aveeno or Olay moisturizers. I stopped using it on my face and started using it on my body instead, but it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
    <li> I have used this face moisturizer for a few days. I have used it on my face, neck and so face, no issues. I use it in the morning only. It has a pleasant smell and it doesnt leave my skin oily feeling. I have noticed that my skin does feel smooth. The only issue I have is with the seller, they didnt give me a way to track my order. I would highly recommend a way for me to be able to do so.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always hated face creams that coated my skin with thick oil, leaving me feeling greasy. This cream absorbs quickly into the skin and leaves a refreshing moist feeling with no greasy after effect.</li>
    <li> Makes the skin feel fresh and smooth. I would  recommend it to all my friends and family,also to those who have dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great value. I can&#x27;t believe how much money I&#x27;ve wasted on tiny over-priced facial moisturizers, everything from Philosophy to Keihl&#x27;s. This stuff smells good, feels clean and soothing, and there&#x27;s SO MUCH of it. I have a very dry nose which sometimes cracks and flakes after showering, but no longer! This stuff makes my face feel smooth and supple.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this lotion, what else can I tell? I guess it&#x27;s a good one and price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> I do not think it moisturizes well enough to be a facial moisturizer. I have pretty dry skin though. I think it makes a great body lotion because there is a lot in the jar and you can get more out than a pump dispenser.  It absorbs quickly, does not have much of a fragrance, has never caused me to break out, and makes my skin feel fairly soft. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any anti-aging effects. I have used this product for at least 6 months, first as a facial moisturizer, then (and now) as a body lotion.  I think it is a good price for the quality and amount.</li>
    <li> I love this cream! It smells very clean but not strong and it is going to last a very long time because it only takes a very small amount to cover you. I have been using it every night for two weels now and can genuinely say theres a noticeable difference in the smoothness of my face.</li>
    <li> I like the way my skin feels and it does seem to keep it hydrated, which diminishes the appearance of fine lines. Overall, I would not call it a godsend.</li>
    <li> I initially ordered this product on a recommendation from MaskCara, Cara, a beauty blogger who also put a plus in for this site. I ordered the item and waited excitedly for it&#x27;s arrival. Unfortunately, there were problems with shipping that had nothing to do with the seller. Supposedly it was delivered when I wasn&#x27;t at home and weirdly enough, USPS failed to leave a notice for pick up. In the meantime my face needed moisturizer. I had to go to a Drug Store for this purchase. HOWEVER, I was very impressed with Unplugged&#x27;s Customer Service, Natasha did a great job of tracking the item and reporting the problem to me in a timely fashion with great professionalism and respect. I was given a refunded immediately after I requested one. Based on Natasha&#x27;s exceptional assistance, I would be confidant to order again. And so far, I love the product! Happy Story in the End.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite go-to face creams. Moisturizes without leaving my face feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> Love this for face and body. I go through it fast using it all over, but it&#x27;s great on arms and legs here in the desert!</li>
    <li> AMAZING I really love this product. My skin feels awesome. I have terribly dry skin and this really helped</li>
    <li> I have used every expensive lotion for the face from Kinerase to Clarins  to Chanel and everything else in between. This light as a cloud, non greasy face cream is sheer heaven and its crucial ingredients, collagen and elastin really replenish my skin and make it look and feel like I am 18 again (I am 41). The scent is also very light and very pleasant as I am trying to avoid heavy, perfume laden creams and lotions. This stuff absords beeeeeeautifully and I wake up to gorgeous, glowy, youthful skin. I always trust nature based products and this one doesn&#x27;t disappoint! Great, affordable price and wonderful age reducing results that have done me proud over the last 20 plus years!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m around 20 and only looking for product that does basic moisturising since my skin gets pretty dry during winter. It does nourish my skin. After applying it for a month, my skin doesn&#x27;t look dry even when not using it for a day or two.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an effective moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg, then try this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it apart of my night time routine: cleanser, toner, then the moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been using it since October 2008 and noticed that my skin became clearer and smoother. I&#x27;m mid-20&#x27;s and  still have breakouts. Since trying this product my skin hasn&#x27;t been very temperamental and honestly, its been the best in years. I truly believe this has been a huge help because its keeping my skin hydrated so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this one on whim and now I would recommend it to all!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. Super simple and effective. Best collagen elastin cream out there. Oh and it&#x27;s readonlibly priced too. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> A bit greasy. Smells good. Didn&#x27;t work at all for mom, but hardly anything does. Even though you&#x27;re using the cream it will not work miracles. You still need to get rest, drink lots of water to plump up your skin, eat nutritiously, decrease stress, take vitamins.</li>
    <li> Love it! Leaves my face nice and smooth. Im so glad I bought it because I had recently bought a moisturizer from MAC and it made me break out. But this product is amazing. I would recommend buying this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 26 years and that is all I use on my face! I don&#x27;t wear any makeup. My face is very soft &amp; smooth. I hope they Never stop making this product!!!</li>
    <li> Love this, and the price! Works just as good, if not better than expensive moisturizers that I&#x27;ve used over the years. It&#x27;s a great daily moisturizer.</li>
    <li> love, Love, LOVE this stuff! My favorite moisturizer so far!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had really dry skin my whole life and I&#x27;m always on the search for a good moisturizer that keeps my face moist but not greasy and doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg. After hearing good things about this stuff I finally got it with high hopes, but after about three months of trying to see results I find that my skin is barely moisturized. Might be good if you have normal skin but if you&#x27;re extra dry like me pass on this stuff.</li>
    <li> Works well, no weird smell. Feels nice after exfoliating my face. It hasn&#x27;t helped really with fine lines and wrinkles, and I&#x27;m only 29.</li>
    <li> Love love love this moisturizer! Use it everyday. My husband also uses it and he has somewhat sensitive skin. It us absorbed into the skin quickly! Have been using this moisturizer since 2010</li>
    <li> After a shave it does not burn my face.  It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue behind.  This lotion has lasted me quite awhile and until I realize there&#x27;s lotion out there thats cheaper and better quality i will continue to purchase this</li>
    <li> This is the fountain of youth in a jar !!!!  I&#x27;m 45 and have been using this for a year, my skin has never looked so refreshed and youthful !!!!!</li>
    <li> Was hoping for a creamier, thicker moisturizer ... It&#x27;s the consistency of lotion. I love St. Ives, but was disappointed. Some of their hand lotions are thicker than this.</li>
    <li> Once you use St.Ives Facial Moisturizer you will be addicted to! So inexpensive but still the best moisturizer out there. Don&#x27;t think that because its price is so low you are not getting quality. I cannot be without it!  Goes deep into your skin. You see results immediately. Wear it under makeup or with no makeup for a natural look showing healthy glowing skin.&lt;br /&gt;I am 52 and have used this moisturizer for several years. It doesn&#x27;t matter how old you are, or what type of skin you have, this is just the best product in the market!</li>
    <li> I use this lotion for my face as part of my nighttime regimen. I haven&#x27;t noticed it helping with lines or plumping my skin, been using for over a month. It&#x27;s not too greasy and absorbs quickly, no strong fragrance. I have sensitive skin and this has not cause any irritation or breakouts.</li>
    <li> I never thought I would end up really liking this after all the expensive ones I bought. This works just as good or even better. Makes my face soft and I think it did reduce lines. What i like about it is I can be moisturizing so generously on my face but it still gets absorbed quickly with no greasy feel. The best part is it does not mess up with my foundation. It actually makes it easier to blend.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to get my husband to use a skin care regime. Easier said than done, but he is using this, morning and night. This is one item that has a lot of benefits, and he is more apt to use one product, rather than many.</li>
    <li> good lotion and smells good too</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff since I was a teenager (on and off). I am now 27 and have sustained some damage from years of the sun and tanning bed, but overall the quality of my skin is pretty good on its own. I have tried many different products and nothing really seems to thrill me. I am someone who likes to have ample amounts of moisturizer to apply and it drives me crazy that other brands have a tiny 1.0 or 1.5 oz bottle selling for dozens of dollars. My skin is always &amp;#34;thirsty&amp;#34; so I feel like I could use use up that amount in no time, especially because I also focus on my neck and décolletage! This moisturizer is thick but not greasy, is plentiful, and of course, a wonderful price. I stopped using this moisturizer about 3 years ago after college graduation when I moved and it was not available in my area, so I got on the Mary Kay bandwagon for a bit thanks to a coworker. Now that I have once again relocated, I was psyched to find my beloved moisturizer locally (I did not purchase from Amazon). It was about five dollars for the ten ounce jar. I was happy with MK products, but had recently developed mild acne for unknown reasons and figured it was time to switch up my regimen anyways. Plus, you just can&#x27;t beat this price. I love and use all the St Ives products: body wash, cleanser, apricot and green tea scrubs, body lotion. Always a pleasure using this stuff. I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s available to me again! Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer and excellent price for the quantity. So many people compliment me on my skin and say I look 10 years younger. I use this day and night.</li>
    <li> A ton of lotion for a very low price. My face is extremely prone to breakouts and after a week of use I haven&#x27;t seen any sort of bad reaction. Smooth and silky, put it on at night and wake up with luxury skin! Can&#x27;t recommend it enough!</li>
    <li> I loved this moisturizer when I first got it. I was on my A game washing my face multiple times a day and this rich creme kept my face soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, now that I don&#x27;t have time to wash my face as often, this moisturizer is too heavy. It feels like it&#x27;s greasy even. So if you&#x27;re prone to oily skin already, or don&#x27;t wash your face routinely, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
    <li> This will last you forever. Just don&#x27;t over apply or you&#x27;ll get a bit greasy. Once I found the correct amount for my skin, I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. I have really dry skin and was looking to step it up a bit. I now use this mixed with 100% argan oil. Then I apply my sunscreen face lotion on top of it. So far so good and my skin is not as dry.</li>
    <li> Love it.  I would recommend to anyone who wants a good Moisterizer.  I&#x27;ve been using ever since I bought it the first time.  I was able to find it in the stores</li>
    <li> Smells awful texture is nice but I couldn&#x27;t get passed the perfumey smell. Wish it was fragrance free and I would buy again</li>
    <li> this product actually caused my skin to break out.  I  wasn&#x27;t too pleased with that surprise.  Maybe will work better on my legs and arms.  I do like the fact that it isn&#x27;t as greasy as a lot of lotions.</li>
    <li> Now I know this product doesn&#x27;t really advertise for face moisturizing, but it works really, really well for it. I generally get super dry skin, like if I take a shower in warm water, my whole face will become blaring with dry skin peeling off. It&#x27;s gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product I was able to get for a measly $9. I&#x27;ve used it for a month now, and I&#x27;m not even 1/10 of the way through it. I put a little dab on my finger and it goes the whole way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From one male to another, buy this product gents. It&#x27;ll make you feel way better.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews on this I decided to try it.  The winter has been tough on my skin and I needed extra moisture.  My skin is soft and supple after first use.  Not greasy at all.  I love this and will keep using it.  My face has a glow and looks very even and healthy. I am happy I tried this and you get a good size tub for the price.</li>
    <li> I put this on every single night because it feels really good on the skin. After just a few weeks, my face got softer and feels more refreshed. I really don&#x27;t know the reason why it works so well but I love it! Very effective1</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer. Im not sure how well it works against wrinkles but it does make my face feel more firm. Its also not greasy or oily so it great to use under makeup. It comes in a large jar that will last a long time</li>
    <li> I sure this product is good for some, I tried it and it didn&#x27;t work well for my sensitive skin. The perfume in product gave me a outbreak.</li>
    <li> Very slippery :( doesn&#x27;t work well for me as hand moisturizer, but feels great for my face! Does what its suppose to for me but nothing more. No complaints here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year now and can definitely see a difference!  I haven&#x27;t used it in combination with any other products so I know the results I&#x27;m seeing are from this moisturizer and nothing else.  Short of surgery or expensive treatments, nothing will turn back the hands of time completely.  But when you compare expensive moisturizers to this one, I have been pleasantly surprised with the results.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive, feels and goes on great, and makes my skin incredibly soft. I was a loyal user of Philosophy Mosturizer, but after using this moisturizer I&#x27;m a diehard fan! Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like this moisturizer more for my neck and shoulders rather than my face. I found that it made the delicate part around/ near my eyes burn a little. However, I have sensitive skin. Definitely not meant for eye cream. I love the light texture and light scent. It&#x27;s a really good product for a non name brand/ high end product.</li>
    <li> applying felt rich and moisturizing. felt some lines on my face become less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;however,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after a few applications my face become dry and my eyes swelled up the morning after nightly applications and i broke out in rashes across my neck. the alcohol in the lotion burned my thinner skin when applying as well, around the eyes.</li>
    <li> Not nearly as good as other St. Ives product&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used. This lotion was very thin , my skin didn&#x27;t absorb any of it, Pass on this!!!</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;m 18...So I didn&#x27;t buy the product to use as anti-aging or super collagen elastin anti wrinkle whatever. I was just looking for a good smelling moisturizer. What an amazing moisturizer. I&#x27;d never used a facial moisturizer before because I have oily skin, so I believed it would only increase breakouts, but after reading the awesome reviews on the St.Ives website I decided to go for it. I am so pleased with this product. First off, there is what seems like an endless amount in the jar. Second, it smells so fresh. When you apply it your skin immediately looks dewy, rejuvenated, and feels wonderful. I&#x27;m glad I bought two jars! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week so far and it does NOT make me breakout, if anything it may have helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy moisturizing!</li>
    <li> I am noticing reduction of appearance of fine lines on my forehead since using this product.  And I love the price.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t need to used make up anymore</li>
    <li> Works! A little goes a long way. I feel like he instantly works. seeing improvements in my skin. I also use it for my elbows.</li>
    <li> Have not used long. But it is not greasy. Odourless. Mousturizes well.&lt;br /&gt;I like it. Easily absorbed. Have to use longer to see any impact.</li>
    <li> This product is great and really inexpensive. It goes on light, absorbs fast and lasts a long time. The tub will easily last me a year.</li>
    <li> This product is just.. not that bad..I just think it is not that moist..but I like it is not greasy</li>
    <li> I have not noticed a difference in my skin after using this for over a month. Smells nice but not overpowering, the moisturizer isnt as thick as I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> I know some reviewers express concern over using this on delicate facial skin because of the mineral oil. That&#x27;s up to the individual, I guess - I love this stuff as an alternate when an AHA moisturizer becomes too irritating (can always tell by the extra redness in my face!) or, heck, when I&#x27;m too broke for a fancier cream. I find the St Ives to be silky and fast-absorbing. But what many people don&#x27;t mention is this stuff is also AWESOME as a body lotion! I use it on my arms/hands/shoulders/d&amp;eacute;colletage after a shower, and it quenches the skin, sinks in very fast, and leaves the skin looking healthy. At $4-5 bucks for a huge tub, it is absolutely worth having some of this around at all times!</li>
    <li> Love this cream! Use it after cleaning my face at night and in the morning, and my skin started to glow. I am in my mid-40s, and the collagen works wonders for me.</li>
    <li> It definitely keeps my skin moisturized but other then that not seeing a difference. The scent of the moisturizer is light and the texture is light, not a heavy cream.</li>
    <li> Silky smooth and really helped me with my dry winter skin.  I also found that it was great for my hands as well.  This tub is a very generous size and will last a long time.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s such a generous amount of Moisturizer in the container and the scent is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. For its&#x27; price, this product is one of the best, if not the best.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good lotion. Very affordable. I haven&#x27;t had time to use it very much; I&#x27;ve only had it about a week. But, so far, it is a good product.</li>
    <li> This cream is so light, but rich feeling as well. Lasts a long time, feels wonderful on my face.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell, gave it away to someone else.  The price was so good it wasn&#x27;t worth shipping back.  I am sure someone else will enjoy it.  Fast shipping</li>
    <li> moisturizer. Absorbs immediately. It works better for me than more expensive products. St. Ives products are good quality and are economical.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this stuff.  Amazing.  My skin has never been so soft and I use it on ALL my body since it makes everything sooooo very soft and smooth and I love it.  Great for face but also all body and even bottom of feet too.  I can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff and just ordered another 6 jars.  The price can&#x27;t be beat for this wonderful product.  I am definitely a big fan and can&#x27;t see using anything else.  Never used a product that has made me so happy and soft at the same time.  Thank you St. Ives for a great product.</li>
    <li> Use it every morning and night ahhhh</li>
    <li> At less than $5 a jar, St. Ives Facial Moisturizer, Timeless Skin Collagen Elastin is quite a bargain. Using it occassionally on my face, nearly daily on my feet and after a month or so I have not hit the bottom of the jar yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned that the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; fragrance is very strong when you initially open the container. I&#x27;ve noticed that the scent has faded (my smell sensitive daughter told me it &amp;#34;doesn&#x27;t stink so bad&amp;#34; now) as the weeks have passed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint is that the cream is so slick that it slides off my fingers before I can get it on my skin. Surprisingly, it does not leave an oily residue, the scent quickly fades and even with my sensitive skin and mixing this with magnesium chloride oil does not break out my face, nor anywhere else I put it (feet! this plus mag oil has my feet looking and feeling a couple decades younger!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decent product, great price, will probably reorder it as it works great on my feet and hands.</li>
    <li> it was quite nice but too oily for my skin in places</li>
    <li> I am absolutely amazed! I admit, I used this product for something other than my face. I had a baby 6 months ago. I had gained a LOT of weight during my pregnancy due to a medical condition that caused me to retain dangerous amounts of water. The skin on my stomach had stretched so bad during pregnancy my skin was not just stretching but tearing. It took me 6 weeks to loose all my weight, and I was left with horrifying loose skin on my tummy, literally I had am appointment scheduled with a laser center for July 20th because of my insecurity and my issue with this extra skin getting pinched in zippers, &amp;#34;sorry for the gross details&amp;#34; I decided to try this product on my stomach 2 weeks ago, because of my husbands strong objection to me going under a laser.. I can&#x27;t believe the difference already. Not only is my skin very noticeably retracted, but my skins is as soft as my daughters!</li>
    <li> I have a few different moisturizers and this is one of my favorites.  The fragrance is nice and light and I love they way it feels on my face.  This was a great purchase and I recommend this product.</li>

    <li> Love the silky application but not sure if its breaking me out (using two products). Not sure about mineral oil &amp; doesn&#x27;t feel like moisture keeps, but doesn&#x27;t pull skin w application &amp; feels refreshing. I have dry (age related) skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love St. Ives. Their  products work better for me than most others and do not cost as much. I give this moisturizer an At</li>
    <li> Read this was recommended by Dr. Oz and have since tried.  I find it to be very light weight and not at all greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this moisturizer for years. It&#x27;s light and not greasy. I was glad to find it online as the local shops don&#x27;t seem to carry it any more.</li>
    <li> Despite Dr. Oz&#x27;s recommendation and the fact that I use a number of other St. Ives products, I was really disappointed in this moisturizer.  I have fairly dry skin, and this product simply does not make my skin look as good as when I use Olay or Mary Kay moisturizing products.  I also didn&#x27;t care for the feel or visual received when I use this product under either my Cover Girl liquid or Mary Kay creme foundations.  I will not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> My all time fav moisturizer. Just right, not too thick but not too light. Can be used before make-up is applied for added moisture even if you don&#x27;t have dry skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working ok.  I purchased and will likely try something else.  Didn&#x27;t see improved look in my skin.  It does provide a nice moisturizing feel.</li>
    <li> This cream does a good job of keeping the hands moist without a greasy feel. I&#x27;ve tried those that are triple the price yet do no better. St Ives is a good value.</li>
    <li> Very cheap and very nice facial moisturizer! I am planning to buy another for my mother, and I think she will also like it both because its price and its effect!</li>
    <li> I use this everyday and can see the difference in my skin.  There is also a difference when I do not use it because of dry winter skin and spring allergy skin.  It works great and I love it.  I plan to buy more.</li>
    <li> St. Ives Facial Moisturizer, Timeless Skin Collagen Elastin, 10oz is fantastic. I make sure this automatically sends to my house everymonth.</li>
    <li> Comes in a very large tube. Smell doesn&#x27;t bother me, is a nice creamy texture and soaks in quickly. I apply nightly.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a long time, best product. 1 year ago on amazon it was 4.98, like EVERYTHING else on Amazon, the price has doubled. Go buy this at Target for 4.00!</li>
    <li> Awful! This does not moisturize at all. Not sure what dr. Oz was talking bout. Sucks! It does smell good though.</li>
    <li> I like this product &amp; should use it more than once a day, but it does help my hands look less &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I like this moisturizer because it is so sheer.  I can wear this moisturizer under my  makeup, even in summer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very lightweight non scented moisturizer however I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s done a thing for my wrinkles. I like the way it feels though...not greasy at all!</li>
    <li> My skin is pretty dry and this moisturizer is very good. I&#x27;ve been using it since 2 years and I really love it. It adsorbs quickly and is very light. Great product!</li>
    <li> Use this product in the am and pm after rinsing/washing my face and have noticed that my skin looks much more hydrated. Have already ordered another since I don&#x27;t want to ever be without this product.</li>
    <li> pretty good face cream. I use it as a moisturizer, not for the anti-wrinkle affects, so can&#x27;t judge on that. As far as delivering moist and smooth skin, it works great!</li>
    <li> Love it, love it, love it! A little goes a LONG way!!! Exactly the same as I remembered from before.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes well. As far as fine lines it didnt really affect any of mine but it functions well as a moisturizer, keeps the face moisturized.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product as it works as well if not better than other super expensive products that do the exact same thing</li>
    <li> I use this cream for preventive aging and it&#x27;s great! It does not make my face feel oily, even though I have acne prone skin. This will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is light and causes no irritation to my skin.  It works as good as all the expensive creams I&#x27;ve tried. I would highly recommend it to anyone who has dry aging skin.</li>
    <li> makes my skin look and feel radiant, and i dont have that greasy feeling like other moisturizers do to me.</li>
    <li> Use on my hands.  Like the body lotion better.</li>
    <li> I was worried about this since I have oily skin, but it is light and silky. I wear it to bed but could easily wear it as a daytime moisturizer as well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Just some lotion in a jar that smells pleasant. Doesn&#x27;t improve anything really.&lt;br /&gt;Great for removing makeup at the end of day.</li>
    <li> This stuff hydrates my face super well! This is my everday moisturizer and I love it! Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product! And it helps a lot with fine lines and wrinkles! &amp; lasts me a few months!</li>
    <li> Really like this moisturizer. It goes on very smoothly and isn&#x27;t greasy. Love the way my skin feels this winter after using this. Also put an extra layer on my feet in the morning before I put my socks on and have not had any dry skin on my heels since I started.  And a dab under my eyes at a.m. and p.m. seems to be reducing my darkness under my eyes. I&#x27;m 50 and the older I&#x27;ve gotten the darker they became, this is reversing that a bit. And its a big jar for the price!</li>
    <li> good moisturizing cream on every skin type. the price is good, not too expensive like other mositurizers available in the store.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. I use most of the time during summer time 2 or 3 times a day. I use on my body also. Is cheap and good product.</li>
    <li> I loved this product and recommended it to many friends. Price is reasonable and very effective for daily usage. It feels good on skin.</li>
    <li> This product miosturized beautifully.  However, I had a violent allergic reaction to the ingredient coumarin.  I went to the emergency room one day because of pain shooting down my jaw, neck, and arms.  I thought I was having a heart attack.  This continued for months until I finally figured out that it was this face cream.  Coumarin is a preservative that was outlawed in the USA by the FDA in 1954.  It is used in perfumes, liqueurs, and some tobacco products.  Think Jeffrey Wigand from &amp;#34;The Insider&amp;#34;.  It is also used in rat poison.  Be warned!</li>
    <li> Cheap, but works very well on my skin. And there are more natural ingredients than a lot of other higher-end brands.</li>
    <li> this product is wonderful, effective, low price, good quantity, I believed it&#x27;s only lowest price skin care product that I know on the market for that good quality, my husband have used it too, he was so happy that now everywhere he go, he always bring it with, we have saved a lot for our budget</li>
    <li> My Dermatologist recommended this over the $300 a jar stuff...it&#x27;s non-greasy</li>
    <li> Booo!&lt;br /&gt;St Ives is now owned by Unilever.  I&#x27;ve checked my jar based on some of the other reviewers,  and the ingredients have changed and the &amp;#34;cruelty free&amp;#34; logo has disappeared from my St. Ives products. This was a decent moisturizer, but not enough for me to sell my soul or possibly slowly kill puppies with  (depending on the lab they contract with, but it&#x27;s common) . As a consumer who liked the health and earth conscious image  the St. Ives brand had,  I will instead search for a new facial cream.  Some of the more thorough reviewers have posted some excellent links for more information.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. First heard about it in the Seattle Times (rated very good). It is an excellent moisturizer and leaves your skin with a nice glow. It is very inexpensive too. I would recommend highly!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a face cream, that I could use all day, and I really liked it. Its a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer. it is a huge jar for super cheap. I love most of St Ives products. The only problem is I wish it was more natural and dint have so many harsh chemicals. Still this is great face cream. This feels very light on. You just need a little bit. this jar will last you forever! I use this twice a day and my skin is flawless! It helps for sure. I am 34 years old so I am starting to get more lines on my face. This worked right away. I saw results in how smooth my skin looked. I even had family compliment me. This does not irritate my skin at all. The smell is fresh and clean, Nothing chemical. You can probably get this at any drug store for less then $5. This works just as well as other expensive creams. It has collagen in it so it tightens your skin for sure to leave firm radiant skin.</li>
    <li> My wife really loves this and it seems to make her face glow..  We will be buying more in the future</li>
    <li> Great stuff!!  Nice, light moisturizer that has no greasy feel to it. Makes a great base for make up. It also has a nice light scent that you can enjoy while applying it but don&#x27;t have to smell all day.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;m aging, I&#x27;m trying to find a moisturizer that keeps my skin feeling (&amp; looking) soft and smooth. I&#x27;d recommend this one if this is what you also need. I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed any decrease in fine lines after use, but my skin always feels very soft and smooth. I&#x27;ve even put it on the backs of my hands &amp; they too feel smoother. Buy it - I think you&#x27;ll like!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many face moisturizers I&#x27;ve used over the years. Lots. I still come across half full bottles in the closest or bathroom from three or four years ago, products that were too greasy, too thick, too irritating, too smelly, too watery, too expensive for such poor results. Ugg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I do love St. Ives. I love their body lotions, hand lotions and masks, so when I came across this face moisturizing I was so excited. I searched for it in stores for a couple of weeks, and came away really disappointed. It seems like the only place you can buy this now is on the internet, and I&#x27;m thrilled that Amazon had such good prices. I spent around eight bucks for my 10 ounce jar, and a month into the use of it morning and night, I&#x27;ve barely made a dent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be thirty this year, so I am  taking preventative steps in my skin care routine now. Baby laugh lines, deep thinking lines and smile wrinkles are all visible (though my boyfriend says I&#x27;m the only one noticing at this point!). I am not ready to commit to heavy duty anti-wrinkle products yet, but I did want a product I could use daily that would give my skin a boast. This is that product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer soaks in quickly. It has a light, floral scent (smells like other products that have safflower in it) and is white in color, with a smooth, solid-ish consistency. A lot goes a long way, and usually I just use some of what is on the lid of the jar, left there from jostling the jar around. I use it all over my face, neck and decolletage. I am careful to avoid my eye area though! This product is really, really NOT eye friendly, and that is the only drawback. The product warns to avoid the eye area, and that&#x27;s no joke. I do use a separate moisturizer for my eyes anyway, and I usually apply that first so I have a good idea of where to put the face cream afterwards. A little warm water or witch hazel can calm any eye contact though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month I am really content with this moisturizer. It does not make my skin overly oily, it does not irritate my skin -- though it does bother my eyes if I get it in or near them -- and it soaks in fast, so I don&#x27;t have to delay putting on make in the morning, or laying down on my pillow at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I haven&#x27;t seen over the top, super results as far as my little wrinkles go, I do know my skin is consistently moisturized, more even in tone, softer and yes -- a little bit firmer. I also love that I can layer other things on top (like a primer, sunscreen or powder) without my skin getting clogged and gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I am really pleased with this product, and it is now a staple in my skin care routine. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this when I run out...in about four or five months! Ten ounces is a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-JR-moisturizer.

    <li> St Ives never fails and neither does this moisturizer. You can easily pay $20 a bottle for a face moisturizer but this one is the best. You can tel a difference when using it- and it leaves your skin so so soft. Smells great too.</li>
    <li> No miracles but a good general purpose face moisturizer. I get monthly hormonal breakouts and this product is too thick to use during that time. Great for decotage and neck.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite moisturizer for many years! Love it! It&#x27;s been hard to find in most of my local stores.</li>
    <li> This cream is great for when you are short on cash and you just need a moisturizer to get you through for a while until you can afford your normal good stuff but its not to permanently replace your facial moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 5$ a TUB (this thing is gigantic) of facial moisturizer that alone should have red flags from miles away of what to expect quality wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very fresh, light almost leafy smell to it and applying it is very easy and smooth but it does not keep your skin radiant, moist and above all it does not keep blemishes/marks/wrinkles and every day wear nurtured and hidden like other creams will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this 3 stars because its great value overall, smells fresh almost like that clean scent after rain and because I do like St.Ives body products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weigh the must haves on your list and make the right choice for your skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used St. Ives Collagen moisturizer for years after buying it the first time on a whim.&lt;br /&gt;It is very light, satiny smooth, not greasy at all, and works fantastic under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it over any other moisturizer--plus, it won&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
    <li> I began using this product when I was 19 years old.  My roommate, who was a little older, loaned me a bit of hers.  I was hooked after a couple days!  This moisturizer works really well.  I always apply it when I get out of the shower, or wash my face.  It keeps my face, which is very oily, soft and blemish free.  I was afraid that my face would become too oily because it&#x27;s already oily to begin with, but I don&#x27;t have to worry about that with this product.  I ordered this off Amazon because my local stores stopped selling it!  It&#x27;s actually cheaper off Amazon.  I definitely  recommend this product to every young woman.  I&#x27;m 25 and get told that I still look 18.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this moisturizer. I have been using it for about a month now, and I already see an immense difference in my skin. The collagen that is in it really works to tighten up your skin. Additionally, it feels soooo cooling and refreshing when you put it on. The only recommendation I would have to improve this is to put it into a pump bottle, so that it does not need to be unscrewed every time. However, I see the advantage to this type of packaging being that you make sure you can get even the last little bit out. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m simply very allergy to it. after i used it the first, i had to return it. wherever i put it on (my face, hands, arms) all felt very very itchy. but amazon said i could keep the lotion, i gave it to my mom. she used it for her hands; she said she felt her hands got smoother :).</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is my favorite.  It is not a bargain, but one of those things you don&#x27;t want to skimp on.  The price here is the same as WalMart&#x27;s.  .</li>
    <li> I already have been using it .Just bought more at a great price. The sale helped me save money. Thanks</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and St. Ives products have always worked really well on me.  I tried this facial moisturizer a few years ago, and it is now one of my favorite facial products.  It is soothing, non-irritating, and fast-absorbing.  It feels great on--very light-weight.  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I got one of these for my sister and one for myself. I haven&#x27;t started using mine but my sister is loving it!! saying it moisturizes well, its nice and thick and creamy but not heavy and she feels her face is tighter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of more costly moisturizers (Elemis, Philosophy, etc) and this stuff does just as good a job. I can&#x27;t believe how cheap it is! I get compliments on my skin all the time.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  I have spent 80% more on Clinique brands and other expensive moisturizers.  This cream does the same as all of those.  PLUS, because of the low cost I can use it on my whole body and not just my face!</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer. Can&#x27;t find a reason to spend more when this seems to do everything I need it to do!!</li>
    <li> I keep re-ordering this product. I cannot believe how great it is and how affordable. My skins looks and feels great using this product. It is great for the face, but I use it all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris Wodke&lt;br /&gt;Author: Running for My Life- Winning for CMT</li>
    <li> I tried this cream after it was recommended by Dr. Oz. He wouldn&#x27;t steer me wrong, would he now? It is a good cream - but very light. If you have dry skin, it will not be enough for you. I have to use another, heavier cream to keep my face from falling off. Great value though.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer. First heard about it through Dr.Oz, yes, I will admit that, but it really is a great product at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;It has not dissolved any wrinkles, or erased any blemishes, but it does work for its intended purpose of moisturizing skin.</li>
    <li> I have skin which is prone to breakouts and after a few trials with different products I settled with my current pond&#x27;s cream, which I have been using for past three years as a night time moisturizer. Recently I stumbled upon St. Ives facial moisturizer while randomly looking around for facial creams on amazon and started to read the reviews. Propelled by all the good things people had to say I went ahead and placed an order for the product. Thank goodness for that... now I know there is a much better product than what I am using for a cheaper price.  I received it today and had to try immediately on my face. I applied a fingertip full after washing face. The cream got absorbed so beautifully in my skin that I vowed to write a review before going to bed. It&#x27;s like that ideal feel of neither dry nor oily, just perfectly smooth and soft skin (It feels almost as soft as my 3 years old&#x27;s skin). I am in my early 30s and don&#x27;t really need a fine line remover as of now so not concerned about that aspect. As long as St. Ives keeps my facial moister balanced I will keep on using it. If it prevents any fine line I will take it as an added bonus.  Also worth mentioning is it&#x27;s almost addictive smell. Very faint yet very catchy, somewhat like a mix of fresh leaves and baby powder with hint of citrus (at least to me). I can&#x27;t get enough of this fresh fragrance.  Loved this product instantly... highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Upon the positive reviews, I ordered the 4 pack of moisturizer. Warning: One is MORE than enough! It goes on a bit like a cold cream (burrr) and once distributed, really soaks into your face. I have used pretty much every moisturizer there is and this one competes with the higher end products. Leaves my face fully moisturized and smooth without feeling oily.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly.  Seems to be good, guess I will know for sure in a couple years IF I LOOK YOUNGER  ;)  THANKS</li>
    <li> It gives me little pimples around my nose and between my eyebrows for some reason, but it makes my skin really soft so if you don&#x27;t have acne-prone skin it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of many of the St. Ives products for their value and for the fact you really get results. I just turned 45 and realized I needed a litttle more of a boost in the moisturizer department. My neck was looking a little crepe-ish and I wanted to keep that in check. The Timeless Skin Collagen Elastin moisturizer really helped a lot. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. There is quite a generous amount of it in this tub (its going to last me forever!). Its great because it doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out...which does with many other lotions and etc. And I wake up with super soft skin when I use it before I sleep. The fragrance isnt overwhelming or anything either. Would recommend and buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this product and it work very well i use it everyday and my face looks great everyfay, i jus feel. Beautiful when i use it</li>
    <li> St. Ives is a product that many people have come to depend on for results as advertised.  This is my first facial moisturizer by St. Ives, and it is light, not greasy, and absorbs into the face without a greasy film.  It is extremely light, and only a small amount needs to be used. It does not have any strong fragrance smell or included in the jar.  A great difference can be seen after a few days of using this moisturizer.  I recommend this moisturizer highly, and will definitely order this moisturizer again, the price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> so creamy, not greasy. Recommended by Dr. Oz and I see why. I need to get some more. I really like this stuff. No more of my buy expensive Macys facial creams.  This is the stuff!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really used regularly , so can&#x27;t tell yet. I hate creams and anything on my face, but this does not feel bad</li>
    <li> totally love this face lotion.  I am on my 3rd jar now........will recommend to anyone.  I will keep buying this</li>
    <li> I like how the formula feels, and it really does moisturize my face. The only problem that I have with it is that it smells a little bit like sunscreen- which doesn&#x27;t exactly bother me, but if it had a nice smell, then it would really improve the product.</li>
    <li> feels great on my skin! great size and great price</li>
    <li> Huge tube and light-medium thickness--not too heavy for your face. Overall great moisturizer and totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I have used this for quite some time. This is the second jar I am using. The price is good here.</li>
    <li> St. Ives is always quality and this product is no different. There&#x27;s so much of it, you can use it on your hands too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- a TON of it for the price&lt;br /&gt;- Hydrates as well if not better than products 3-4 times this cost&lt;br /&gt;- Smells nice (tho some may think this is a con)&lt;br /&gt;- Great consistency&lt;br /&gt;- Spreads well and evenly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Offers no sunscreen potential, so for me, this eliminates daytime use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, you can&#x27;t lose with this product and it will last you forever. I have had this container for months now and there is barely a dent in the product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not perfect for me and my skin but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve come across.&lt;br /&gt;I can still feel it kind of on top of my skin if I&#x27;m still damp from the shower.&lt;br /&gt;However, using my exfoliating scrub and this moisturizer together gave me notable results.  Friends and family noticed too and it&#x27;s not like I have crazy-bad acne (anymore.)&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product at a good price and I&#x27;ll continue to use it while on the hunt for the perfect moisturizer. (I have tried many others that I won&#x27;t continue to use so this is saying something, I promise.)&lt;br /&gt;If it helps anyone: I have fairly oily skin that isn&#x27;t prone to drying out, I&#x27;ve never avoided shine for more than an hour of my life.</li>
    <li> I wanted this to wrk. Smell is amazing but my face just hated this product made my face break out</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is so good! It is thick but absorbs quickly. I find the smell to be very pleasant. I imagine this tub will last me a long long time as you only need a small amount.</li>
    <li> This is a simple moisturizer with great texture for day or night use.  It sits nicely under makeup and I even put it on my body, because why not for that price?!  Mix it with a bit of serum or oil for heavier moisture at night.  You can mix a bit of it with your foundation to make a BB cream for a lighter makeup look on the weekend, and I&#x27;ve mixed it with shimmery gold eyeshadow to create a highlighter for cheeks.  This is a staple in my skincare kit.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because it received high ratings from other customers but I&#x27;m not sure I like it yet.  Will continue to use and hopefully notice smoother, softer skin eventually.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!! I&#x27;m 29 and have used it since middle school. I look 20!!!</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and like the feel of this cream on my skin. I apply it right after showering when my skin is still wet. It goes on smoothly and is quickly absorbed. Love it!</li>
    <li> Hooray! I really do like this face cream and I use it twice a day on my face and neck. It is very moisturizing for me without being greasy. I am a woman in my 50&#x27;s and it&#x27;s great for me. My daughter, who is in her twenty&#x27;s finds it too oily for her young skin (so sad) anyway, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 years now and I don&#x27;t plan on switching to anything else anytime soon! Clear skin, no breakout or allergic reactions, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Although I liked the quality, it was really awkward having the lotion in a tub, rather than a tube.  I had to scoop out the lotion, and I don&#x27;t have anything to do that with other than my hands.  I ended up having to toss this once it got to the end, because it got dirt in the jar.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after hearing Dr. Oz recommend it.  However, it caused me to break out terribly.  Maybe it is best for dry skin or post menopausal women.</li>
    <li> I know this is a facial moisturizer, and it seems a bit heavy and oily for my face - doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference. It is very moisturizing for the back of my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I give it a 5 star review for the area around my eyes. I accidentally discovered that it works wonders for my eyes. I&#x27;m in my 30s and if I put this around my eyes (but don&#x27;t let it get in your eyes, because it&#x27;s not intended for this purpose) within minutes, I seem to look younger. I get mistaken for someone 5-8 years younger if I use this around my eyes at night. I use this at night before bed and I also apply some Perricone MD Firming Facial Toner (also, not intended for use around eyes). And I look a lot brighter, younger and healthier when I look in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other more expensive eye creams with collagen and elastin and they didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference. Something in this makes a huge difference for me.</li>
    <li> St. Ives Facial Moisturizer, Timeless Skin Collagen Elastin, 10oz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very soft and creamy..&lt;br /&gt;loves the lighter feeling on face&lt;br /&gt;nice smell</li>
    <li> I had no idea what collagen was made from, called St. Ives and they let me know I&#x27;ve been putting codfish on my face.  Ugh.  They also test on animals.  What a dissapointment.</li>
    <li> So I bought this yesterday (7/31/13) at Target for $5 because of all the great reviews here and because the price is cheap for a facial moisturizer. I gave it a try to save money compared to what I normally use for more than 10 years now, which is Origins Antioxidant Moisturizer with White Tea for $45.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To achieve the moisture from St. Ives, you have to reapply 2-3 times within an hour. I used it last night before bed and this morning. There are still some dry skin on some parts on my face even after I put it like an icing on a cake. Unlike Origins, one application and your face is moisturize for two days. Unfortunately, St. Ives doesn&#x27;t do the job in one application. So it&#x27;s not for me and so now I&#x27;m going back to spend $45 on moisturizer. I guess my skin is not used to cheaper products and I&#x27;m a guy. I&#x27;m still going to use this as a body cream or hand cream. 3 stars for the price and for its huge size.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product but prehaps better suited for those with dry skin. My skin is kinda oily and it made it worse.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer!  I have really dry skin, and this moisturizer leaves my face feeling smooth and soft. Diminished fine lines is visibly noticeable!</li>
    <li> I love this. It absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave that sticky feeling.  It&#x27;s also a big container for the price.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin, and this moisturizer works wonders. Especially for such a low price, I would absolutely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have been using St Ives Timeless Face Moisturizer for years. It absorbs quickly and is great to wear under my make-up. It really is a perfect moisturizer for me.</li>
    <li> I use this moisturizer every once in a while, and I really love it because it is light and also does not have a strong smell to it. It is actually great for everywhere, not just your face. I think if you used it for just your face, it would take forever to use the whole jar.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter and myself.  My daughter suggested it for me as she was already using it.  We both love it.</li>
    <li> I tried this cream on a very deep scar that I have and the following day, the scar was barely visible.  For the price, this cream beats all the others.</li>
    <li> Feels like I&#x27;m putting silk on my face, gave some to my mom, she loves it too! Great product for the price and the size of the jar is awesome!</li>
    <li> I love this product for my neck and arms, its light not greasy.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic! I&#x27;ve used pretty much every lotion on the market and find this one to be my fav. you can&#x27;t beat the price either. Note that I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, I am 30- so using more for preventative routine. I find my skin to be fresh, not oily, and glowing using this. I switch between this and pure vitamin A cream as my night routine and use this in the morning daily under my makeup.</li>
    <li> I use this every day.  It&#x27;s a light face cream and it is not expensive.  It doesn&#x27;t  have the texture of an Olay cream, but then it&#x27;s three times less expensive</li>
    <li> I love this cream. It is light and soaks into your skin easily. Keeps your skin so soft, definitely recommend !</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from this lotion.  It smells nice, and it is okay, but if you are looking for a really good moisturizer, this is not what you want.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does help with dryness, but I doubt that I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Absorbs well, non-greasy. Provides good hydration. Has silky feel. Is thicker than a lotion but a little thinner than cold cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the cream like texture of this product.  It&#x27;s not greasy and I will continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin. And I got this to last me through deployment based on reviews. I never had any issue w too greasy, it was always just right. After deployment I got into the fancy face creams and spent a fortune. But this is the one I keep coming back to. It lasts forever as a little goes a long way. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell. And it doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune. I even had a dermatologist recommend it to me, and when I told her I was already using it, she told me she was proud of me for not wasting my money on the more expensive but exactly the same product.</li>
    <li> i really like this moisturizer and bought it for my face but find it alittle&lt;br /&gt;oily for my skin. It is quite a large jar so I am using it for my dry skin&lt;br /&gt;on my legs - it works.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer smells fresh, feels great, isn&#x27;t all nasty and thick, won&#x27;t make you break out, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I love this non greasy lotion, my skin feels healthy and moist after I use it..every morning and  night. Recommend.</li>
    <li> I write this review so you ladies will buy this  because the last time I fell I love with a prouduct the maker ( Vidal Sassoon) quit making it so I don&#x27;t want it to happen again....I have 57 year old skin in pretty good condition within a few days of using this cream I would say I had great skin!  You get a very generous 10oz so you don&#x27;t feel like you have to go sparingly with applying it to your face and neck....I use it very night and in the mornings when I don&#x27;t put on make up.  I use a lighter moisturizer if I&#x27;m going to put on foundation....Better than the high priced creams I&#x27;ve bought .</li>
    <li> I am 26 and was looking for a product that helps and shows a noticable difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont have wrinkles but fine lines are starting to show under my eyes. I have been using this tub for about 2 months now and after the first 3 days i could notice a difference. I usually put on a nice layer at nite and depending on the weather in the morning i might wear a thin layer before i apply my make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its a nice light moisturizer too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell my fine lines are less noticeable and my face seems smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love this product</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but applies well, not super oily, I did not break out (meaning did not cause pimples), and my skin does feel more supple.</li>
    <li> This cream is great! It leaves my face really soft. Some facial lotions are too thick and leave your face feeling gunky - not this one.</li>
    <li> This product is no longer carried in any store and I am thrilled to be able to get it though Amazon.com.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I selected this face cream based on other reviews.  I love it.  It feels good as soon as I put on my face. It is so cost effective compared to all of those high end store face creams.  I honestly can&#x27;t tell the high end creams are any better.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an alternative to Avon&#x27;s Accolade night cream and found it. This cream is better value for money and is as good on my skin as Avons. Dr Oz was right!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. It feels lightweight on my skin, but it doesn&#x27;t do much moisturizing on my skin because I become oily after a couple hours.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product- I returned it and got my money back.  I have been using &amp;#34;fruit of the Earth vitamin E skin care cream&amp;#34;- but wanted ti try somthing different.  I thought I would try St. Ives because of all the good reviews.  I agree that it is too much like a lotion- a thin  lotion.  I would suggest you try the vit. E cream- it can be bought cheaply at walmart.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for the price. I have seen a difference in my skin. I use it before bedtime so I wake up with soft skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as my primary face cream for about a year now, and have to say it works very well.  Also gentle, not animal tested, and smells nice. No complaints! I DID have to get over the idea that a face cream must be expensive to work well.</li>
    <li> I have really dry skin. My skin used to peel around my nose and cheek all the time! After buying a facial spin brush and this I haven&#x27;t seen any flakes on my skin. I put this on in the morning before my makeup and at night before I go to sleep. This stuff is AMAZING. It&#x27;s so lightweight and moisturizing. I now see what all the hype was about. This is now going to be apart of my skincare routine. I have baby soft skin now! Amazon doesn&#x27;t pay people to write reviews so believe me ladies! Don&#x27;t go wasting your money on expensive, high end products when this gives the same results. :D</li>
    <li> The only moisturizer i use! It makes my face smooth, no sticky or liquidy face after applying and its just good!!</li>
    <li> Reasonable product that does the job.</li>
    <li> Nice moisturizer. Leaves my face moist but not greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion on my face for a couple of years. Comes in a large enough tub I even use it on my body and it is absolutely wonderful.</li>
    <li> I really like it but if you have just scrubbed/exfoliated your face, you may want to wait a bit otherwise will be a bit on the sting-y side</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is great.  I use if for myself and for massages for my spouse.  It is wonderful for the price too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for a facial moisturizer/toner ever since Nivea discontinued selling it&#x27;s anti-wrinkle cream several years ago. I have not found anything that works as well, and this St Ives product doesn&#x27;t work as well either. Granted, you get a lot of cream for the money, much more than I expected, but it is not as rich as the pricier products. So you will most likely need to use more.</li>
    <li> great cream and great price. makes my skin very elastic&lt;br /&gt;however, it can be purchased at wal-mart too! I will buy it again</li>
    <li> Ive been using this now for about 3 1/2 months and overall, I am happy with the results.  My skin has more moisture than prior to my using it.  Before buying it I read the online reviews and can honestly say I concur, additionally, my face has not broken out as much as it used to before I began using this moisturizer.  The only reason I gave it a 4 is because I find it takes a little long to absorb onto my skin but aside from that I completely recommend this product.  Great deal for your money!</li>
    <li> On the recommendation of Maskcara.com, I bought this &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; brand face moisturizer.  Not at all greasy, feels great under makeup or alone, and the price is right.</li>
    <li> this cream is awesome! it&#x27;s light weight and great for the dry winter weather and I believe it will be just as great in the summer because it&#x27;s so light weight. It gives my skin the moisture it needs and my skin feels happy after I put it on.</li>
    <li> This jar came to me slightly opened and the contents sneaked out onto the other items in the shipping box. It did not have a seal or plastic inner cover as other jars I&#x27;m used to purchasing have. I wonder if it is a new jar or if the cream is even the real product now.</li>
    <li> This St. Ives Facial Moisturizer is great!  I can see and feel the difference in my skin.  I use it every morning.</li>
    <li> I always liked this cream, very good moisturizer, it smell good and leave the skin smooth. Quite inexpensive compared to others and comes in a big tub</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for a while and it&#x27;s not greasy and works very well at a affordable price.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a hopefully suggested substitute for a $148 jar of similar facial goo.  It passed with flying colors and actually seems to make a difference in my girlfriend&#x27;s skin.  I tend to think that most of these skin products are junk, but this is definitely worth the money and will keep your lady happy.  What more could you ask from a moisturizer?</li>
    <li> This stuff lasts long! Its great! Its consistency and light scent is great. I can&#x27;t really tell if it helps with anti-aging, but its a great everyday facial moisturizer. Even my bf likes to use it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I am 44 and have somewhat dry skin.  I enjoy DHC skin care products, and I use Lancome make-up, taking advantage of the \\&quot;gifts with purchase\\&quot; which usually include wonderful moisturizers.  This fabulous product works just as well, if not better than all the other expensive products out there.  I originally came across this on Pinterest, as there was an article showing Dr. OZ highly recommends this.  I don&#x27;t always believe in everything that guy has to say, but in this case he knew what he was talking about.  Great product for an ever greater price!  I love it, and will be buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> I love St Ives, it is great for sensitive skin and I use it on my face and around my eyes.  Works great and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 24 &amp; I have combination skin &amp; I usually still deal with minor breakouts, I bought his about a week ago &amp; I barely have out a dent in the container, a little really goes a long way, it&#x27;s not greasy. It also soaks into my skin very quickly, I have really bad laugh lines &amp; I&#x27;m starting to notice that they don&#x27;t look as bad! I haven&#x27;t have any breakouts because of this moisturizer. It&#x27;s a great product. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this  product.  I gave been using it for years and I got the product for a great price.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely mild moisturizer for anywhere, and the price is right. My daughter and I both really love it. Good for face, hands, anywhere.</li>
    <li> Very good product, very surprised, it feels really good on your screen and it is huge, it will last forever!</li>
    <li> This is a really effective, gentle moisturizer. I get very dry skin in the winter and so far, this is a HUGE help, even after I use acne medicine that dries me out even worse. It&#x27;s also got a great smell! It absorbs fairly quickly and doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel greasy or coated in anything.</li>
    <li> This is a super great value, and the moisturizer is lush and creamy.  At 65, it&#x27;s just what I long for... large jar and feels great.  I use it morning and evening.  In terms of whether or not it will leave me glowing and younger looking, I don&#x27;t know.  I&#x27;ve just been using it for a few days.  I really think diet has more to do with our skin&#x27;s health than creams.  But it is important, of course, to stay moisturized and to care for our skin.  I feel really good about this product for that.  If I start looking super glowing and young in a few weeks, I&#x27;ll come back to let you know!</li>
    <li> I have purchased St Ives products over the years and I have always found them to be good products that are available at a reasonable price. I prefer this moisturizer to some of their lotions for a total body moisturizer because it is a little heavier than some of the lotions. This is great for my mature skin.  Cerave is even better for me but the price is much higher.</li>
    <li> Dr.  Oz was on point with this!!!</li>
    <li> The product is really light and good for oily skin. It also has a relaxing scent and is a solid buy for such a low price. I&#x27;ve always been pleased with St. Ives products - this one may be my favorite!</li>
    <li> Have used this product maybe 30 years. I find it non-greasy and absorbing. I am a senior and no one believes how old I am. I have a few wrinkles but not deep ones. I believe using this product twice a day has helped me look younger than my years.</li>
    <li> Like the size for daily moisturizer, has a pleasant fragrance, not too perfumey. I have been using this product for two months and love how it moisturizers my face. I live in the dry hot desert and have used Mary Kay for years and this product is more economical and does the job. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I use this product day and night and it has been very beneficial to my face in that it is not as dry as it was. I have only been using it a few weeks, so don&#x27;t feel quailfied to give a full review yet.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading many reviews online.  My Mom and I both use this and absolutely love it.  It&#x27;s wonderful, does exactly what it says and is super affordable.  Hard to find in brick and mortar stores but is easy get on Amazon.  Try it - you will love it, too.  Thanks, Amazon for carrying this and for free shipping with $25 orders.</li>
    <li> I should have listened to the 1 star reviews. This stuff is *disgustingly greasy*. And on top of that, within 5 seconds of smearing it on my face, my face started to itch!&lt;br /&gt;I bought it at a local grocery store for $2 less than the current amazon price. But still, that was money wasted.&lt;br /&gt;I stupidly tried it in the car on the way home (sitting at a red light). My face was burning and itchy until I got home to properly wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;And my poor face still feels a bit dry. Yuck! DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer - it comes in a rather large tub, so it can be difficult to apply if you are not in front of a mirror. The tub is too big to carry around in your purse, so I only use it at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is thicker than normal moisturizers, but I don&#x27;t have any problem applying it once it is scooped from the tub. It does absorb into the face cleanly, and you can go straight to bed without having to worry about leaving grease on your pillowcase. It is actually surprisingly light considering how thick the cream is when you remove it from the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t rate this product higher because the biggest downside - portability - is something I really need in a moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I gave this three stars mainly because I know I&#x27;ll have this product for the rest of my life. I literally have to take a little swab from the cover on my finger tip and that&#x27;s enough for my entire face. If I go over that finger tip swab, my face will be greasy for the entire day. I was also hoping that it would smell as good as most of the other St. Ives products but it really just smells like your typical, everyday (scentless) lotion. That aside, I&#x27;ve seen marked improvements in my skin. I use it twice a day (morning rise and bedtime). My skin has become noticeably smoother and I&#x27;ve been complimented on a bit of a glow. I enjoy touching my skin because of how soft it&#x27;s become, and my complexion seems to be toning out. So I guess it&#x27;s worth the grease and tentative application, especially considering the quantity for such a great price.</li>
    <li> This cream is okay when you apply it makes your skin look more vibrant and minimizes lines a little but its not a product you can keep using over time and notice dramatic changes after a period of time</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite moisturizer! I&#x27;ve used it for a few years, starting in my mid-late 20&#x27;s and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. It&#x27;s light and non-greasy and doesn&#x27;t make my acne prone skin break out. Most people mistake me for someone in their early to mid twenties rather than 30&#x27;s and I believe it&#x27;s partially due to moisturizing with St. Ives Timeless Skin every night before bed (plus daily SPF).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately St. Ives has been bought by Unilever, which tests on animals. I&#x27;d love to see the old St. Ives that doesn&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using St. Ives facial moisturizer for over 25 years and I still look like I&#x27;m in my early 30s! I love this creme -- does make your face timeless!!!!</li>
    <li> I started using this product in college and I have to say I really love how little it costs. Most anti-aging products break the bank but this stuff is inexpensive and works well. I use this before bed and when I wake up in the morning. I think that it helps a lot and I like having a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make my skin too oily or too dry. Having combination skin, I completely trust this product on my skin. I completely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have been using clinique and i was looking for a budget-friendly drug store product that also works well. I use St.ives facial scrub and body wash that i love, so i decided to give this a try. Glad i did coz it&#x27;s fabulous! Its been only a week and my combination/oily skin look and feels good! Definately a keeper! Not to mention the price...can&#x27;t beat that for the jar. I hope they maintain it. Happy!!</li>
    <li> I really like the St. Ives brand! I’ve been using a number of their products for quiet a long time, [[ASIN:B004RRC5UK particularly this particular exfoliator from St. Ives.]] Unfortunately I swim a lot and because of that I’m also washing my face quite frequently. I’m also in the sun so that’s why I’ve been desperately searching for something that could help my skin maintain an healthy, radiant glow despite how dry my face can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this moisturizer (the Timeless Skin Collagen Elastin Moisturizer) because it’s easy on my skin, and I can feel my skin is a lot smoother after using it. The one thing it doesn’t really do well is effect the dark-circles and dry wrinkles around my eyes, especially the smile-lines (crows feet) that a 30 year old woman SHOULD NOT have!!! I’ve been using [[ASIN:B00L3KEIZO this eye cream]] as a supplement and have found that it’s really the only eye cream that has worked at minimizing some of the sun effects around my eyes. So while I really do enjoy and will continue to use St. Ives, for face, I’d say you can’t really use it for your eyes as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly the St. Ives moisturizer is good, but I’m not sure if it’s truly rebuilding collagen or not in my skin. I can say that my skin feels smoother, but a true collagen rebuilder is usually taken orally, through supplements or the right foods. For example eating a lot of oranges or taking a vitamin C supplement would help rebuild collagen. Some people actually cut thin slices of oranges and put them on their face! I’m not much for that because of the way it feels, but I wanted to just state that I’m not 100% sure how much collagen you can get form a topical cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I still like it and I love St. Ives’ philosophy. So go ahead and buy it!</li>
    <li> Still testing to see results after 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Light and quickly absorbed. Pleasant scent. An excellent moisturizer</li>
    <li> This cream is very lightweight, has a good clean scent and most importantly it absorbs into the skin fairly quickly leaving it feeling supple. I predict this large tub will last approximately 6 months to a year. It is most definitely worth the price and I highly recommend it. The only knock is that I have very dry skin and thus one layer of this cream isn&#x27;t enough for me, I usually have to apply three layers to get my skin feeling perfectly hydrated.</li>
    <li> This is my second jar.  Helps keep face smooth &amp; soft and helps with wrinkles.  Does not remove fine lines but keeps them under control.</li>
    <li> Love this Moisturizer!! It feels so good on my skin. The price is amazing. It doesn&#x27;t break my sensitive skin out. It really puts moisture into my face and I do feel like it slightly plumps it. I have never found a moisturizer that didn&#x27;t break my skin out. This will last a long time too because the tub is big and a little goes a long way. I put it all over my neck and chest too and let it soak in. It feels really nice and smells great.</li>
    <li> I have used this product off and on for many years.  I always come back.  Works for me!</li>
    <li> Wonderful moisturizer, Inexpensive and most importantly for me, cruelty free. I alternate it with a higher-end moisturizer for my aging skin. Nice scent, medium texture.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve read reviews and decided to give it a try. After 5 days of use, I am not disappointed. It moisturizes well, and hasn&#x27;t broken out my skin. It&#x27;s a large amount for the price.</li>
    <li> Good product, and a very generous size. This moisturized very well and was still light weight. However, it caused me to break out because this moisturizer is NOT OIL-FREE! Just wanted to let others know about this small but important detail because it is not mentioned on the jar or in the description. If it works for your skin, great! It just didn&#x27;t work for mine because it isn&#x27;t oil-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*edit*I should have read the ingredients before buying/reviewing this product, because mineral oil is the 2nd thing listed. Lesson learned! (And lesson learned about my skin too.)</li>
    <li> I have been using St. Ives for a long time. It is the best moistrizer I have ever used. I love the collagen. It  doesn&#x27;t sit on my skin and feel greasy. It gets absorbed and goes right into my skin making it feel soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer.  I have been looking for a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t cause acne or make it worse and also moisturizes well and this is it.  So many moisturizers that are marketed for people with acne contain ingredients that make acne worse but this moisturizer isn&#x27;t like that.  One of the reviews mentioned that it&#x27;s not oil-free which is true but not all oils are bad.  For example, jojoba oil is not comedogenic AT ALL, but it doesn&#x27;t absorb well and just sits on your face.  You can&#x27;t go out with it because it looks like you have olive oil on your face and you can&#x27;t use it at night because it all ends up on the pillow.  This moisturizer absorbs really well and the oil that it contains (mineral oil) does not cause acne.</li>
    <li> This product contain mineral oil therefore it broke my face out with tiny bumps everywhere. I used Queen Helena mask and they went away in a couple of days. However, I use it on my body and it feels great.. Soft like a babies bottom.</li>
    <li> Even though it&#x27;s not a huge jar you only need a dab and it will cover you face. I love st ives products this make my face feel so smooth. I&#x27;m only 26 and i don&#x27;t have wrinkles but this make my face and skin feel so healthy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a man, who has naturally smooth, typically blemish free skin. My entire skin care regiment has basically consisted of a good soap and water scrub in the shower with my wash cloth, and that&#x27;s that. My skin has never felt like it was in need of a moisturizer, and after a regular old shower wash it feels pretty good, or \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; as my wife likes to call it.     But I&#x27;m also an actor, and I&#x27;m 31 years old now. I drink a lot of water (when I don&#x27;t I can tell the difference), I don&#x27;t smoke, and I rarely drink, but I&#x27;ve also started looking around for skin care products that will help me preserve the quality of my skin, and keep me as fresh and youthful looking as possible. For me it&#x27;s not an issue of vanity, but of actual livelihood; how my skin looks has actual career and financial implications. Having good skin isn&#x27;t an excuse for me to just assume I&#x27;ll always have good skin, and I&#x27;ve heard enough times by now that starting younger is better.    Back in the day my sister and mom use to use the old St. Ives apricot scrub, which I used a few times many years ago. You know the one that basically felt you were scrubbing your face with gravel. I liked the rougher texture, and decided to turn to try St. Ives now when I was looking for some skin care products. After reading reviews for several, I ultimately decided on the extremely well regarded [[ASIN:B0017MO8AS St. Ives Timeless Skin Daily Microdermabrasion 4 oz (113 g)]]and this moisturizer.     Last night I used both for the first time. While I&#x27;m looking to take better care of my skin, I also am not looking to use a 1,000 products, or have a lot of fuss and work over my skin. The exfoliating cream was a lot less harsh than I expected, especially in comparison to the old apricot scrub. I used that, let me skin dry a little, and then applied the moisturizer.    Now like I said above, I&#x27;m use to \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; skin naturally. But about 10 minutes after applying this stuff I was literally floored at how my skin felt. My skin feels better than I have ever felt it in my life. It&#x27;s extremely smooth, feels taut, and looks vibrant and bright. I don&#x27;t have a ton of experience with a wide variety of skin care products, so I have no idea if this is standard, but none of the products I have used even remotely came close to making my skin feel, and look, this amazing. My wife came home and I told her she had to touch my face, and she did. She said it felt really \\&quot;firm\\&quot;, almost like I&#x27;d had botox or something (which I thought was hilarious). She couldn&#x27;t stop rubbing her arm on my face, just to feel the texture. I think she was a little jealous ;).     It&#x27;s over 12 hours since I put this stuff on and my skin still feels like a satin sheet. I&#x27;ve never written a review for a skin care product. I never imagined I would even be compelled to. But I&#x27;m telling you, especially you reluctant men out there, this stuff feels insanely good on your skin. Between this, and the other product, I&#x27;ve found something quick, easy, and most importantly, something that worked from the FIRST application.</li>
    <li> I have tried literally everything for my sensitive skin. This absorbs quickly but leaves the skin firm and with no oily residue. This works really well and I feel I&#x27;ve gotten results with only two weeks of use so far.</li>
    <li> Works amazingly well. And for such a great price.  I don&#x27;t know why anyone would spend more. My skin looks better than it has in years.  Wrinkles and fine lines are reduced, my pores are smaller, there is less sagging and my skin has an overall glow!</li>
    <li> It is moisturizing but not greasy. Nice large quantity will last a long time. Very reasonably priced. I would have preferred if it had sunscreen, so I only use it at night.</li>
    <li> Just started to use this product so do not know how it will work.  I do not like the smell.</li>
    <li> The price was very nice so I decided to try it. The key is to not really rub it thoroughly into your skin. It dries to quickly. I have very dry skin on my face. Not like flaking pieces, but feels tight or dry especially during the winter. So I just put some on my finger tips and push it into the skin. especially under my eyes. I keep a light thin coating on it to really seal my skin. It smells great and I even put a dab on my 12 month old who had a patch of dry skin on her arm...worked great. I can appreciate the amount you get too. All around I am happy.</li>
    <li> I feel like my skin doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;Drink&amp;#34; this moisturizer, it just sits on top of my skin. It smells lovely but there are better moisutizers in my opinion. It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
    <li> My face broke out with this moisturizer. Not so happy with this st.ives product</li>
    <li> The concentrated stuff.  put directly on the face.  collagen is found in moisturizer soap and mostly in conditioner.  You may add this to your soaps and conditioners.  at the time of purchase it was 10$ for 10z.  A bottle of conditioner is $1.  If you can find a high concentration collagen conditioner for cheap I suggest that.  There are also collagen pills. (im not convinced with the pills either.)</li>
    <li> My daughter told me about this moisturizer.  She loves it and so do all her friends and so I had to try it too.  It is truly wonderful.  It has a great smell and moisturizes without being greasy.  Now I love it !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a man and I use this following my mud mask removal. Deducted a star because it makes me look oily.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer and i think it was a very good value.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance so my husband isn&#x27;t opposed to using it either. I like the fact it is not greasy - it&#x27;s more of a lightweight moisturizer so can be worn alone or under make-up. I&#x27;m glad I found this &amp; will order it again (though not for awhile as it comes in a good sized container!) St. Ives has great products.</li>
    <li> Feels great, moisturizes great, smells great, and this will last me a long time. So glad I found this before I bought something else</li>
    <li> I ordered this because my face get&#x27;s really dry in the winter and this stuff makes my face feel so soft. It doesn&#x27;t make it oily at all and it doesn&#x27;t look oily. I was afraid it would make me break out but I&#x27;ve been using it for quite some time and I haven&#x27;t yet. If anything it&#x27;s smoothed out my complexion and taken away some red scarring.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Keeps you from peeling after too much sun.</li>
    <li> Not so great before you put on makeup but a great night cream. I am still in search of the perfect moisturiser but this is the closest I have found without taking out a home equity loan.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer with a pleasant scent. It&#x27;s a great value for the size - most moisturizers come in 1.7 ounce jars, and cost anything from $5 to $500. So a 10oz jar is really quite large by comparison, and this was only around $6. For my combination skin, it worked extremely well, though it is a bit too heavy for the summer months. During those times, I switch to a gel moisturizer.</li>
    <li> While I initially purchased this for my face, I quickly discovered that my skin does not like it. It is way too heavy and oily for my face. I noticed breakouts after using it. However, I now use it as a night cream for my hands and feet. They are incredibly soft with it. So for its intended  purpose- 0 stars but for its repurposed use- 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Tried this for three weeks.  The ad was promising, but the results did not justify the claims.  I have used Avon&#x27;s Renew Ultimate for years and find using the day and night creams keeps my skin much better looking, soft and relatively unwrinkled for a 75 year old.</li>
    <li> This cream is okay.  It lasts forever, even using it several times a day since I live in a dry climate.  However, there  is a down side to it lasting forever in that fingers - no matter how clean - ruin the purity of the product over time.  I&#x27;ve loved St. Ives brand for decades, but as another reviewer stated - I feel that the quality has changed since Unilever bought St. Ives.</li>
    <li> I started using this product about a month ago. Since then, my skin has been really soft, but I originally bought it to get rid of some wrinkles. At first, I didn&#x27;t see any results and I thought it didn&#x27;t work. I looked in the mirror today and I realized I can&#x27;t see any of the wrinkles on my forehead unless I look really close! I&#x27;m definitely going to keep using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, it would probably work best if you used it everyday. I don&#x27;t, which is probably why it took so long to show results.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this moisturizer, and the price is great.  It is not greasy - very light with a nice, fresh scent.  I used to buy it at the drugstore or supermarket, but everyone stopped carrying it and said they thought St. Ives stopped making it.  I was so happy to see it on Amazon.  I use it about five times each day when while working or hanging around the house.  Even so, a jar will last me more than a month.  Great value.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product and due to the great reviews had high hopes.  The smell was pleasant and light but it dried my face out and eventually gave me clogged pores when I wore it at night...</li>
    <li> I just started using it so I can&#x27;t speak as to whether it does what it claims to do but I just love how my skin feels - so soft and silky.  I will continue to use it unless I feel it&#x27;s not diminishing my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> best stuff for making my skin feel good</li>
    <li> Feels good, seems to be an excellent moisturizer and large jar for the money. Very please.</li>
    <li> Best skin cream for &#x27;mature&#x27; skin and sane price.  I use on face and body with uniform, visible results. Should be on every woman&#x27;s vanity.</li>
    <li> great product! i use it before my foundation as a &amp;#34;primer&amp;#34; keeps my skin moisturized but doesn&#x27;t make it oily and i have combo to oily skin naturally. i recommend it</li>
    <li> I bought this product due to its extremely good reviews. I would have to agree with everyone as well! I use this product whenever I come out of the shower. I tend to take long showers and dry out my skin in the process. This moisturizer helps keep my skin fresh, and my skin always feels so soft afterwards! I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap,effective moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. This is the only moisturizer I can use that doesn&#x27;t break me out. AND it makes my skin look AMAZING!!!  I can use it in the summertime as well without looking too greasy. LOVE.</li>
    <li> Nice &amp;#34;light moisturizer. I like to use it on around my eyes. It not irritating. But it&#x27;s not heavy enough moisturizer for a mature woman living in the arid climate of Colorado.</li>
    <li> Good cream to help replenish moisture in your skin.</li>
    <li> didnt expect it to be this huge lol, all good</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. It seriously hydrates my skin. I use before bed and in the morning before makeup. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> I use it twice a day after I wash my face. It gives me oily looks. But It smooth my skin.</li>
    <li> I got this to start a daily acne treatment as a third step moisturizer (step one and two are St. Ives apricot scrub and Thayers rose petal witch hazel toner) and it has worked even better than I thought it would. My skin is softer and my light acne is going away. Wrinkles aren&#x27;t really a worry for me but I have genetic periorbital dark circles under my eyes and after only a week of using this there is already a clear improvement. I was skeptical about the price being so cheap I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work as well but it&#x27;s perfect. My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t love the smell, it&#x27;s a little flowery but it&#x27;s very light and hardly noticeable. Great deal for a great product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good stuff. Moisturizes like a charm.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive product that works as well as the supposedly wonderful, expensive hydro whatever products with vitamin C. And the jar is large and seems like it will last for months, while those products last less than one month.</li>
    <li> I use this product all the time. My skin feel soft and hydrated without feeling oily or greasy. It was a great price on Amazon as opposed to what I pay at my local store, so I got a couple of jars for me and my daughter who also likes it.</li>
    <li> a little goes a loooong waaay.  this makes it much more cost effective than the much more expensive brands on the market.  it works.  it&#x27;s improved the quality and softness of the skin on my face and neck.  i&#x27;m mid 30&#x27;s and people now are asking to see id when i order a drink.  that hasn&#x27;t happened to my for the last ten years!</li>
    <li> As I am not yet out of my other moisturizer I have not tried this yet.  I hope I like it as it is a lot less expensive than my previous moisturizer</li>
    <li> Provides excellent moisture, I love the way my skin looks. I will keep this in stock in my beauty cabinet.</li>
    <li> So, so many moisturizers are way to heavy for us ladies who are in our 60&#x27;s.  It clogs the pores,  This is light and with this cold winter upon us, I put this on several times a day to fight the dry air inside.  Very nice.  Glad I bought it.  Great price too, will buy more!  I think it is great for every skin type and I have combo skin.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! My skin is super sensitive and dry and this stuff absorbs quickly! I use a good amount in the morning and at night and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy at all. I use it before I apply my BB cream and it does the job. It doesn&#x27;t smell funky at all. It smells fresh and I love the consistency. Buy it! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I really like this stuff, especially after shaving. It&#x27;s very soothing. It&#x27;s a light and \\&quot;fluffy\\&quot; moisturizer, and it doesn&#x27;t feel super greasy like a lot of lotions that just don&#x27;t seem to want to absorb into the skin. I don&#x27;t feel that it&#x27;s too \\&quot;thin,\\&quot; I think it&#x27;s just the right consistency, not too thick and not too watery. It&#x27;s a good price and I recommend the lotion. I used to get Kiehl&#x27;s, which is great, but this is almost as good and a much better bargain.</li>
    <li> I just tried this product for the first time.  I am a skin care product junky and consider this moisturizer to be rather nice for the price.  I use it daily. I would recommend it for women with mature skin.</li>
    <li> this product works great for my skin as I use it all over my face neck and scalp after I shave after my shower.My skin stay moist with it and not tight and dry feeling after a shower and shave and it really make my skin very soft and younger looking.</li>
    <li> I really like this facial moisturizer.  I&#x27;m 35 with fair skin and freckles, few wrinkles, and combination skin.  I like the St Ives brand due to the great cost and that they are animal friendly.  This absorbs nicely into skin and doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue or feel like anything&#x27;s on your face after you&#x27;ve rubbed it in.  I don&#x27;t find any reduction in wrinkles, or uneven skin tone, but I do like the feel of my skin after using.  It&#x27;s just a nice basic moisturizer that leaves my skin feeling nice.  I will definitely continue to use this.</li>
    <li> My favorite Amazon beauty product is the Retinol cream that I&#x27;ve been using.  When I tried to reorder, I found that it&#x27;s now an add-on item and I didn&#x27;t want to purchase anything else so I decided to try this moisturizer since it got good reviews overall.  I found that I can&#x27;t use it on my face because I have sensitive skin and it makes it sting and itch.  I am able to use it on my legs and arms so it&#x27;s not wasted but not what I wanted.  It&#x27;s a little watery compared to most moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried.  I won&#x27;t purchase this again and hope Amazon will stop that add-on campaign.  I love Amazon prime the way it used to be!  {I still love it for the videos}.</li>
    <li> It is an okay product, but is very watery and takes a while to get absorbed into the skin. It also does not provide much moisture, so skin is dry by the morning if applied at night. If you are looking for a rich, creamy consistency and a good moisturizer, this is not it.</li>
    <li> Best ever you can used it for up to 2 years just cost a few bucks .if you don&#x27;t buy it .you are stupid</li>
    <li> love it. works well as moisturizer.worth the money and will come back for more. my purchase was 2pack and arrived fast</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this expecting miracles from it, but it&#x27;s a nice daily moisturizer.  It absorbs readily into the skin, has little fragrance, and feels good after I shave (I&#x27;m a guy).  I combine it with an eye moisturizer (I use Burt&#x27;s Bees Eye Cream).</li>
    <li> This is a nice face cream. It makes my skin soft &amp; supple without feeling greasy. This is my new fav face cream</li>
    <li> i knew this wasnt going to be a great cream for the money but this is not for the face at all. It does absolutely nothing i use it for my body just to get rid of it faster.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really nice!  It&#x27;s not greasy and it feels nice on the skin.  It also smells nice!  It&#x27;s a really nice surprise to me in every way, because you get a large jar for the price as well.  Now to see how it works over the long term.</li>
    <li> This is a very good moisturizer but not for me personally. I have an oily T zone and is prone to small breakouts if I moisturize it too much, this cream is thick and very good, and very very moisturizing, hence it made my face feel a bit greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I did use it for my body though! its a very good product and the size is incredible!!!! it will last you for a very looong time!</li>
    <li> My skin is really dry and I like how this moisturizer works and is inexpensive. Because it doesn&#x27;t have sunscreen, I mainly use it before bed and if my skin feels dry during the day. I keep a jar next to my bed, and one in my desk at work.</li>
    <li> Great basic moisturizer, this is the only one I can get my husband to use it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky to him. I don&#x27;t like how much fragrance it has</li>
    <li> I have been using this sense I saw it on Dr. Oz a few years back. I&#x27;m 38, and get called a liar when I tell people my age. I work in a salon full of girls under 25. At Wal-Mart this goes for about $5 a jar</li>
    <li> I have tried many different face creams, but usually, they make me either break out or they don&#x27;t work.  I have sensitive skin, so I avoid excessive chemicals.  This moisturizer works, smells nice, and is a bargain price.  I do not apply daily, but probably every other day following my shower, before bed.  I can see the collagen working by the decrease in my forehead wrinkle.  It resolves the dry patches I get every so often.  And this jar lasts forever, because a little goes a long way!  I even bought some for my mom and she likes it too.  This is a great moisturizer, I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My 14 year old daughter loves this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Worked well, I just don&#x27;t use it enough.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. I have been using this for 2 years now, and it does the job well.</li>
    <li> Not animal friendly anymore. DOnt buy. Theres no reason for them not to be except laziness.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this I was expecting a small container of lotion to arrive, but to my surprise, this container is quite large.  I bought this to use on my eyes, which are very sensitive to most creams.  So far, I haven&#x27;t had any of the burning or itching I get from most products, and I think that I&#x27;ll have enough to last a long time!</li>
    <li> I adore it - I love the results on my skin (really softened my skin and took the redness out of my face). Great price and value!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! It also shipped fast. I am happy with how it makes my face feel when I use it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this face cream for years!  It is not oily and does not cause breakouts.  My face is left hydrated without the heavy feeling of lotion on my face.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak to the anti-aging properties of this lotion, but I can say it is a great, lightweight moisturizer for someone with normal to oily combination skin. I&#x27;m also typically prone to breakouts, but haven&#x27;t had a problem with this lotion clogging pores or causing blemishes. I use it both in the morning and at night and it keeps my skin very soft and moisturized, even in the winter when my skin tends to err toward the drier side.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THEFEEL OF THE CREAM.  I CAN USE IT FOR AS A BODY LOTION TOO.  GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO MY FRIENDS.</li>
    <li> very pleased with this moisturizer</li>
    <li> Bought months ago and still not finished. Don t need a lot. Put on legs and arms after shower. Doesn t small girly. Doesn t smell much of anything. Will buy more if I ever run out.</li>
    <li> Not sure what I was thinking when I bought this. I am a label reader and for whatever reason did not read the ingredients before buying this. I think I got caught up in their fancy write-up on their philosophy of using high quality, natural ingredients. I missed that mineral oil is the second ingredient. I will not get into the details, but a quick internet search will give you all the information your need about that particular ingredient. On the plus side, it is a huge jar that will last a long time if ingredients are not a concern for you. It is pretty greasy so I would use it as a night cream but it is effective at softening the skin. I personally will not continue to use it. I am disappointed in St. Ives. They have been around for a very long time and I have been a regular purchaser due to their affordable products with fairly simple and healthy ingredients, something has changed. I will have to do more homework in the future when buying their products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for probably 20 years, and I&#x27;m now 64.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a miracle potion, but my facial skin is mostly wrinkle-free and looks healthy--and I only apply it about every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, Unilever, one of the consumer product megacorps, now owns St. Ives, and this product has changed. I happen to have an old pre-Unilever jar which states the product is not tested on animals, but the other day, when I bought a new jar at a local pharmacy, I noticed that that claim was gone and there was a Unilever logo in the corner.  So I emailed Unilever asking if the product had been tested on animals, and their response was a link to a web page that contained an awful lot of PR BS about how they&#x27;re trying to evolve into a non-animal testing company, blah blah blah. But no specific information about this moisturizer was offered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I compared the ingredients in the old jar to the new one, and I noticed that at least three of the natural ingredients are now missing and the order of ingredients has been shuffled.  So for any of you who are experiencing skin irritation, there may be good reason for that.  It&#x27;s not the same product it used to be.  Beware.  I&#x27;m returning my jar to the store I bought it at and I&#x27;ll be looking for an animal-kind moisturizer to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please consider writing your representative in Congress to co-sponsor the Humane Cosmetics Act.  The E.U., Israel, Norway, and India have already banned the inhumane and unscientific practice of animal testing on cosmetics. More accurate results can be obtained from human-based cell and tissue testing methods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want more information on cruelty-free cosmetics, check out, on the NEAVS (New England Anti-Vivisection Society) website, the Coalition for Consumer Information on Cosmetics (CCIC), which certifies more than 500 brands that do not test on animals.

    <li> i used this product over five years ago. i lived in california and had many local stores to purchase St Ives Collagen Elastic facial moisturizer from. I recieved many compliments on my wrinkled free skin. Since moving to Phoenix four years ago I cannot find this product. I have even put in request to many retail stores to supply this product and was told that all supplies were ordered automatic electronically. I have tried many other products but I was never satisfied. Resently i decided to go on amazon to look for this product and YEAH!!I found IT.I purchased five jars and in only a few weeks I could see my skin already was starting to improve. Just a small amount is needed for use and one jar will last a long time. Very good and affordable product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 53 and have been using St. Ives collagen and elastin face cream since it came out.  Years ago GNC tried to get the world on board to realize that your face is made up of collagen and elastin and now collagen/elastin has become the rage again.  I love this product but always wanted a face cream with a high SPF included.  I tried places like Lazarus, Elder Beerman, etc. for collagen, elastin, and sunscreen.  I was never able to find it so I just buy the st. ives and add a high number sunscreen to it.  It works great! The price is affordable and there isn&#x27;t a heavy smell (you don&#x27;t need that on your face).  People can&#x27;t believe I am 53! I also use the collagen/elastin body wash, love that too.  I never use a wash cloth on my face.  I was told years ago to use a natural sea sponge and it works great.  Never ever use any scrubs, just cream cleaners and masks.  they rip up your pores, esp. when you get older! Just got my daughter on board, bought her everything for x-mas and added sunscreen to the moisturizer.  She sees the great results and is an avid user of collagen/elastin. My only wish would be to have a face wash with collagen/elastin and bar soap too.  That would make my day!  Pass it on, this is a great product-just be sure to add the sunscreen, the UV rays get to you all year round!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It&#x27;s so light and not greasy.  Works great under your make up.  I plan on buying more when I run out.  Cheap!.</li>
    <li> I bought this item because of all the high marks it&#x27;s gotten on various sites that said it works to help your skin look younger. Personally, that hasn&#x27;t happened to me. The collagen is probably supposed to help in plumping back up the wrinkly skin, but all my microwrinkles are still just as prominent, if not more so.       Still, my microwrinkles are a result of dry skin (partially resulting from genetics) and for that this is the best moisturizer yet! I&#x27;ve been using a lotion as a base for my makeup in the winter as it makes it look a bit smoother, but I didn&#x27;t really like to because it always felt like some sort of stuff was stuck to my face. Not with this one. It&#x27;s light as can be. Within a minute it sinks into the skin and my skin feels so smooth and like I hadn&#x27;t put anything on (except a moisturized version!). I absolutely love the feel and would purchase after this runs out.       I was really surprised at how huge of a container this is- you only need a couple dabs for the face- so I think this should maybe last me a year o.o. I have been using this 1-2 times a day for about a month. Once after I shower, and once before makeup.</li>
    <li> Such a great product at a low price. It seemed not a single store in San Antonio carried this product, so I decided to order it online. it was sent without a hitch. thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer!  It absorbs quickly, has a great smell and makes my skin look great.  I can&#x27;t believe the huge tub of it you get for such a small price.  Meanwhile it rivals anything on the market that I&#x27;ve ever tried.  You can slather it all over your face and neck and not feel like you&#x27;re being wasteful.  I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day along with the St. Ives Timeless cleanser and I am one satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> Disappointed in the cream and the smell is too strong.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer I have EVER used. I bought it for my mother but have been using it instead of my old moisturizers. It&#x27;s lightweight but you can feel it hydrating your skin, unlike other moisturizers (like Cetaphil) that work but leave your skin feeling greasy. It&#x27;s cheap and the container is HUGE; it&#x27;ll probably last more than a year. I definitely recommend it and so does Dr. Oz.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty perfect considering the price. I slather it on daily and really it&#x27;s the only reason I stopped buying expensive moisturizers. I still use them occasionally when I get samples but I won&#x27;t spend the money on them anymore. I have combo skin and I want prevent the look of aging. From my research (I&#x27;m no doc or skin expert though) anti-aging is basically about keeping the skin moisturized not really about expensive creams and potions (although I do use Roc anti-wrinkle cream too because it&#x27;s relatively cheap and fairly effective). Still, moisture is key and this fits the bill for only a few bucks. Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, because it&#x27;s so cheap you can use it as a lotion if you need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, moisturizing is KEY to anti-aging (and sun safety too of course) and this is great stuff!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good! It makes my skin really soft and it comes in a huge jar. This stuff will last me for a lonng time.</li>
    <li> Even though I am 65 years old and cannot expect &amp;#34;miracles&amp;#34;~I have found this face moisturizer to give me the feel of total refreshment for a thirsty face.  I even ordered one for my husband when I reordered.  He uses it daily as well.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m creeping up on 30, and am noticing a dullness in my skin as I am aging.  I have been trying numerous creams, including some that are $20 or more,and I&#x27;m happiest with this St. Ives right now.  I like the scent and it moisturizes great without making me greasy. I would say it&#x27;s perfect for aging combination skin, which is what I have.  Now, I&#x27;m off to find a perfect St. Ives cleanser to go with my new routine!</li>
    <li> This product was incredible!  I am 65 years old and hated the sagging skin, brown spots and large pores that I had.  I have used many very expensive products in the past and they made a marginal difference.  But I decided to give St. Ives moisturizer a try.  I used it for a week and see a visible difference in the firmness and elasticity of my skin.  My skin is much softer and the pores seem smaller.  I haven&#x27;t yet seen any change in the brown spots but I full expect to!  The product is one of the rare ones that really deliver what it promises!  The price is a great bonus so I am ordering another jar.</li>
    <li> I had been using a facial cream that cost $24.95 a jar but found myself suddenly allergic to it.  At the local supermarket, I spotted St. Ives Timeless Skin and thought that at that price, it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it has been a pleasant surprise.  Though not as thick as the more expensive creams, it absorbs quickly and in truth I find it as effective as the more expensive moisturizer that I had been using for years.  It softens the appearance of wrinkles and gives my face a definite glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also an extremely fine cream to put on the face before venturing out on cold, windy days.  It provides a protective barrier against the elements and works well under makeup.  I wouldn&#x27;t dream of going outside in the winter without this moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s worth a try if you are looking for a reasonably priced facial cream.  Everyone&#x27;s skin reacts differently, but IMO there is a lot of hype put out by makers of more expensive brands regarding their cream&#x27;s almost \\&quot;miraculous\\&quot; properties.  This product sticks to the basics and does the job well.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> not really for oily skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and then i couldnt find it in the stores anymore...  a few yeas later i googled it one night and there it was !  i am using it again it has been 15-17 years......i think...  my daughter who is 19 is starting... i love it and it works. But dont forget to use a good sunscreen..[[ASIN:B000UVZU1S St. Ives Timeless Skin Collagen Elastin Facial Moisturizer, 10 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> I saw this on Dr. Oz. They said it was the best moisturizer for the money. I love how it feels, it has a nice sent, and it is a big tub for the money! Should last me a few years.</li>
    <li> I been using St.Ives for years and it works for me and its a great value what more could you ask I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> It works well for sensitive and somewhat dry skin. It is not for excessively dry skin, but I found it to be a great daily moisturizer that does not leave my skin oily in the least. Works well for use before applying make-up as well.</li>
    <li> only been using about a week and my skin looks better than it has in years. I have paid big bucks for high end face creams and I have noticed my skin looks so much better after using this. im using this all over my body.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this moisturizer at all I like aveeno or brands like this much better, this burned my skin and made it really red</li>
    <li> It is not heavy on the skin, it smells nice and it made my skin softer after a day of use.</li>
    <li> i like it. i get very dry during the winter. it doesn&#x27;t provide the amount of moisture i wish it did though. it is light and not very heavy. for the price i can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> a must buy and great smell!!</li>
    <li> its the only cream i use! keeps my skin moisturized and youthful looking</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in 40&#x27;s and have been using it for 6 months. I use it in the morning over skin softener and under sunscreen. It never caused any allergy or skin problems, and absorbs well with no residues. It&#x27;s not very thin and not thick either, can be used all season long. Smells good too. I&#x27;ve used $45 brandname moisturizer that&#x27;s not doing better than this one. Plus it comes in a huge10oz jar, little goes a long way. This is one of those things convinced me that godd things don&#x27;t have to be expensive. Good skin also requires good life style and healthy diet. With that in mind, this product won&#x27;t disappoint you.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Makes my skin feel really refreshed and well moisturized. I really recommend it to anyone. Good price too.</li>
    <li> Very light, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily. Smells very nice. My skin is pretty soft now after using it for a couple months, whereas it used to get pretty flakey around the nose. I&#x27;m only in my mid-twenties so I can&#x27;t vouch for the effectiveness of the collagen elastin on keeping my skin timeless, but I did think that it was a great enough moisturizer to get one for my mom on Mother&#x27;s day.</li>
    <li> I have used this for several months and it is not oily and great smelling. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a basic moisturizer. Nothing fancy but it works well.</li>
    <li> Best results at a wonderful price. Such a tiny bit does the job so it lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> just like any other lotion. I don&#x27;t know why I believe what they say.. there&#x27;s no magic lotion for aging</li>
    <li> Not enthusiastic about skin changes, but adequate and price is right!  Used several years...re-buy without hesitation.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t mean it smells like the product is old. When I wear it, my boyfriend says I smell a bit like a grandmother. The smell is relaxing and doesn&#x27;t really bother me or my SO. As for the actual use, it goes on easy and makes my skin feel super soft. I even use it on my upper arms, chest and lower stomach.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as many expensive creams.  My sister in law was admiring my skin and had me order her some.  The price is good and I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Use this as as night cream, feel great on my skin.</li>
    <li> For many reasons, I wanted to love this moisturizer-- it&#x27;s scent, it&#x27;s price, the fact that it&#x27;s anti-aging, the fact that it is one of the few that does not break me out.  But my skin is very dry and this is simply not enough.  Even though I use another heavier cream at night, this cream is not able to fully hydrate my skin during the day.  So I won&#x27;t be rebuying, but if my skin ever changes to an oiler kind, this will be my first stop.</li>
    <li> My mom wanted this so I bought it for her.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, I didn&#x27;t really care for it.  It&#x27;s too thin and it feels I didn&#x27;t put anything on my face.  It doesn&#x27;t moisturize my face at all, so my skin is dry right after application.  I wanted to like it because the price is good, but I&#x27;m going back to my expensive moisturizer.  I guess you do get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> i just got this and im not a fan of the smell -_- im not sure if i like it or not, i feel like it will take me 10 years to finish this jar... I wish that there was a smaller version of this so that if those who dont like it they dont have to waste all the this amount. I think i will try this and see if there is going be any difference in my face-- if not i might go back to my old moisturizer. There is nothing SUPER good about this product that i have noticed yet, and the only bad thing for me is the smell, so i will wait to see the results</li>
    <li> This is a very nice moisturizer and you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> Its not the best but I like it. Works well</li>
    <li> Very smooth and I&#x27;m constantly noticing the change on my face. Also has a long lasting effect after a few application.</li>
    <li> A friend posted this on Pinterest as the moisturizer she uses, and so I decided to try it.  I REALLY love it - it keeps my skin hydrated (I use it morning and night).  I really appreciate that it is quite reasonable in cost.</li>
    <li> I have used St Ives products for close to 30 years, so, i knew exactly what I was getting.</li>
    <li> A must-have product to maintain youthful, healthy skin.  Applies both day and night.  For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been much of a moisturizer user due to my extremely oily skin. Using them just made me feel greasy and heavy. However, St. Ives is quite light. I only need to use a dab on my entire face and it drinks the cream in without leaving an oily film/feeling behind. I&#x27;ve had no bad skin reactions, either. The price is also great, considering the large amount you get.</li>
    <li> What can I say other than......it&#x27;s cheap, it&#x27;s economy size, and it&#x27;s good moisturizer. If you&#x27;re conscious about your pores......just apply everywhere, except your t-zone before you go to bed and before you apply makeup.</li>
    <li> Very nice facial moisturizer. I have dry skin, and this affordable moisturizer works perfectly well for me. Really worth the price!</li>
    <li> I got this moisturizer sometime back. First felt that is is not very moisturizing. Then started using it for hands. One of the night cream I used changed the formula and my face started breaking out. So I used this as my night cream. After 10 days of use I think I skin looks really smooth. I have fine lines so anyway I use neutrogena night cream with retionol SA. And use this cream on top of it. On the day time I just use this cream. When in the jar it looks like a thick cream, but it is very light and smoothly absorbs on the skin. I have acne prone skin and it doesn&#x27;t break out my skin which adds as a huge plus.</li>
    <li> Actually I bought this product for my husband who after shaving tended to suffer from dry skin around the hairy areas on his face. Now he uses it everyday and in his words... \\&quot;I like it\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough said!</li>
    <li> Love it. Glides on face and really hydrates.</li>
    <li> This product , I won&#x27;t recommend it to anyone , this is just and without a doubt ,,fake ,don&#x27;t buy this cream it could potentially damage your skin</li>
    <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin and cannot deal with many perfumes or fragrances. For such a great price I thought I would try this moisturizer. The container is much larger than I anticipated, so I started using it as an all over body moisturizer after I shower. My skin has never been so soft or looked so good.</li>
    <li> Would buy it again, thanks</li>
    <li> I use St, Ives since I was a teenager and love their products.. I people say I look younger then my actual age</li>
    <li> Did not see any difference in my skin. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I do not like this very much. feels too oily for my skin and absorbs poorly, and I don&#x27;t even want to use it on my hands. I am 22 with just slightly oily skin. I have no idea why the high ratings. You get what you pay for. the good thing about it is that when I requested a return they gave me a refund without making me return it, so at least a good try...</li>
    <li> This is my go to moisturizer in the winter. I slather this on in the West Texas dry climate to keep my skin soft. It has a nice subtle smell that is simply pleasant. A have gone through many times does this moisturizer and will go through many more in the future. This drugstore moisturizer is perfect for those with overly dry skin.</li>
    <li> Since the very first time that you put it on, it leaves a very nice feeling and you can feel it penetrating in your skin. It also includes a lot of product!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It goes on easily and feels so smooth. I put my sunscreen over it and I haven&#x27;t ever been sunburned. I highly recommend it. It last a long time as you only need a small amount for your face and neck. I was extremely satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> great moisturizer, huge container! light and refreshing.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin - it gets oily and yet is still very dry! Prone to acne and it was hard to find a good winter moisturizer that didnt make me break out. This does the trick! Moisture without clogging :) I now use it all year long.</li>
    <li> Great facial moisturizer, not greasy and did I say cheap!! Make sure to get them they&#x27;re go on sale. It happens periodically and that makes the deal even sweeter.</li>
    <li> I use it as a hand cream at night. Works well to heal my cracked and dry hands.</li>
    <li> I like thicker moisturizer</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  For years I have been trying to find the right product combination for my skin. Everything either broke me out or was over drying. St. Ives Timeless moisturizer solved that dilemma. My skin is now clear and soft, less fine lines.</li>
    <li> Great skin care cream....absorbs in and plumps up skin!</li>
    <li> If you go through a lot of cream--this is an inexpensive one to use &amp; it works just like the more expensive department store ones.</li>
    <li> I really like the product and for the price, I can&#x27;t really complain!</li>
    <li> Unilever was instrumental in destroying the original all natural Pears glycerin soap of 1807, not only by removing the natural herbal scents but also by adding a plethora of chemicals to the formula.  Pears has now been discontinued entirely!  Since they bought out Alberto Culver, they have been slowly downgrading all of the St Ives skin products I used.  Beware of the new Timeless Skin Collagen Elastin formula which contains Linalool, It is narcotic and creates respiratory disturbances.  It attracts bees.  It causes CNS disorder.  It is toxic to animals.  As well as Cinnamal which can cause skin irritation.  Their new Pears formula, which contained both of these ingredients, gave me an itchy rash!  In fact, I suggest you check all your personal skin and hair products and avoid any containing these ingredients, which are showing up more and more lately in everything!  Seems like large conglomerates are moving backwards to obtain more profits in spite of knowing better about harmful chemicals and we are letting them and potentially harming ourselves and our planet by buying and using these products.  However, it is becoming harder and harder to find affordable alternatives.  Guess we need to complain to the FDA instead of the manufacturers and get more of these harmful ingredients banned.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a perfect moisturizer to use while I&#x27;m on Accutane, and I think I might have stumbled upon a life-long product. Talk about getting the bang for your buck! Let&#x27;s take a second to realize first that you&#x27;re getting ten ounces of creamy, balanced moisturizer for less than a fiver. This product applies smoothly and effortlessly without any stinging, harsh fragrance, or chemical dependency. My face absolutely loves the stuff. I use this in the morning, at night, and sometimes mid-day, dependent upon the state of my skin - Accutane side effects do not always follow your schedule. I have been using this in this manner diligently for two months and still have over half the jar left. I have virtually no flaking and my skin continues to feel supple and hydrated throughout the day. This also works as a great primer for makeup. I&#x27;m sure you can spend hundreds of dollars on special eye lotion, masks, and night creams, but why? Why take more money from your bank account when you can use this product instead of all of those? This moisturizer has turned me on to St. Ives products and I already have a facial scrub on order. A sincere thanks to St. Ives for not sacrificing quality for cost. My skin appreciates it!</li>
    <li> Who wouldn&#x27;t love a big tub of awesome moisturizer lotion that&#x27;s called &amp;#34;Timeless Skin&amp;#34;? St Ives&#x27; products are great! I first started using St Ives&#x27; products when my mom so lovingly bought me foot cream for my hard, Hobbit feet like soles. It worked wonders! I found this Timeless Skin moisturizer while I was looking for anti-aging creams. I&#x27;m trying to maintain nice young skin by hoarding as many anti-wrinkle/anti-aging/anti-sagging products as I can but with a budget. So many of such creams are so pricey but this product is awesome! Not only in size but in effect. Trust the brands you&#x27;ve used in the past and trust them even more when you know they work and are very affordable!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a nighttime moisturizer. I rub this into my face after I use my dermaroller and vitamin c serum since my skin tends to be on the dryer side. This would be okay as a daytime moisturizer as well but be mindful that there is no SPF in it so you would need to use a separate facial sunscreen or foundation/bb cream that contains spf.</li>
    <li> You sent me the old version, not this one that shows and that I thought I would get, the smell of the old version is just terrible. I definitely did not order that. Shame on you! 😠</li>
    <li> This is an excellent moisturizer.  As soon as I unscrewed the cap, I drowned.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Not heavy. Doesn&#x27;t leave skin greasy. Brings out the glow in my skin.</li>
    <li> Love love this moisturizer for my face it not oily at all and it keep my face all day great scent and goes on very smooth.</li>
    <li> I am almost 47 years old and I have slightly dry skin, but it is also acne prone. I have tried the expensive store brands with slight success, but I always got a pimple or two--even when non-comedogenic labels stated I would not get acne. This product is not animal tested, moisturizes without giving me acne, and is available in a generous size at a fantastic price. I love St. Ives!!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  I bought a tub of it from Walmart and it&#x27;s lightweight and not greasy.  It smells like freshly cut leaves, and the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.  I really only use it at night and it leaves my skin feeling soft and supple in the morning.  Thinking of buying another tub just because.  St. Ives products never disappoint me</li>
    <li> Great Moisturizer! Makes my face feel so soft. It is so creamy and gos on very easy and you only need a little.</li>
    <li> Happy with the product and th price is gud. Speedy delivery I bought 3 jars thinking they are small. I love the smell makes my skin look radiant.</li>
    <li> Well i tryed this cream and i did not see a difference at all, this is just my experience. It might work better for others since everyone has different skin texture and everyone skin just reacts different to products. Just because it didn&#x27;t work for me doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work on someone else.</li>
    <li> creamy and smooth, pleasant smelling, not greasy</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and got excited about finally finding a good lotion for my oily yet sensitive skin. Unfortunately, after a week of use, my fairly blemish-free skin completely broke out. The strange part was that they weren&#x27;t normal blemishes... they were oily, huge, and red insect-bite-like spots. I&#x27;ve stopped using it and my skin relaxed and started healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I really wish I could have liked this product. It smells nice, had a wonderful texture, and didn&#x27;t seem greasy. But my trial was very unpleasant.</li>
    <li> I was using a really expensive moisturizer from Origins that did its job but it felt so heavy and my skin was hot like it wasn&#x27;t able to breathe. I read that Dr. Oz had recommended this so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try! The St. Ives moisturizer is super light and my skin feels hydrated but not oily. It even smells fresh! I will continue to buy this product!</li>
    <li> I used this seriously really effective you don&#x27;t have to buy very expensive product to make your skin look good this one is very effective.</li>
    <li> This works as a good moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;I did not see any visible difference on my face(I used it for more than 2 weeks )&lt;br /&gt;But I use it as a moisturizer for my face and hands and I like its texture&lt;br /&gt;The price is great and the jar is big!</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer for the face and it has a very pleasent smell. It asorbs in your skin without leaving an oily feel.</li>
    <li> got this because it had lots of high reviews and so far i have used about 3/4 of the container but more than half was on the body and not the face. my face is pretty dry and using this lotion made my skin even drier. gave me really bad dry spots with flaking skin. the problem is probably because the main ingredient is mineral oil. when you first put it on you feel &#x27;moisturized&#x27; but once its absorbed its dries out your skin and makes you want to put on more. its kinda like chapstick for your lips, you think its good for your lips but it actually dries out your lips and next thing you know your addicted to applying chapstick every 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> A really nice cream, not greasy, leaves my skin feeling wonderful. I recommend this creme. And in a nice big tub, so needed in this desert air I live in!</li>
    <li> I decided to try the moisturizer after reading through so much good review about the product. When I received my order, everything was tightly seal in a white huge container. Immediately that night I started using it before sleep and morning before work. The smell was pleasant and I don&#x27;t have any greasy problem neither, it was starting off pretty good. However, after first day I started noticing my skin started to have flaky peels, and I seriously thought it was due to the weather turning extreme cold. I continue using it for another 2 days and notice my skin condition started to get worst. I have combination skin type but never have any skin allergies or acne problems. By the 4th day, the skin around my eyes started to turn red, and I was getting serious puffy eyes problem. At that time, I knew this moisturizer is causing all these problems and I stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My condition got really bad when skins started flaking and if I put any other lotion or serum around my eyes, I get painful burn. For days I stayed without make up and prevent using anything to irritate my skin even more. When my skin condition started getting better and I changed over to use Boots Botanics Organics Night Cream and SPF Day Cream. Slowly, all of the irritation is gone and my skin is finally getting the right amount of moisturizer it needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lesson I have learned that I shouldn&#x27;t go cheap on products that actually goes on my skin. I rather spend a little bit more on good product than suffering skin problems like this ever again.</li>
    <li> It feels wonderful when I put it on but reserve the right to rate this product in four to six weeks..</li>
    <li> Very light --almost watery-- which feels good, but perhaps watered down a bit? Large amount that lasted me through a Michigan winter which is no small feet.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get a chance to really use it.  When I received it, it was packed on it&#x27;s side with another item I had ordered and the lid came loose and the cream leaked out everywhere.  I never reordered it because I had put a little on my face and the texture was good but I don&#x27;t like perfumed creams and the scent was a little bit too strong for me.  I could smell it inside the box before I opened it, but then again, I am very sensitive to smell.  It does have a nice texture and soaked into my skin right away.  it was just the perfume scent that turned me away from reordering it.  I guess it worked out for the best.</li>
    <li> This is just too &#x27;watery&#x27; for me to apply to my face. I tend to like more creamy ... creams (heh) on my face. It goes on and absorbs easily, however, and did not break my face out so that&#x27;s always a plus. I have found it to be GREAT for use on the neck though, from the chin to the collarbone, for those who believe in moisturizing past the jawline.</li>
    <li> This product is very moisturizing and has a nice clean smell.  I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days, but my skin is sensitive and it didn&#x27;t burn or break out my skin.  The price is great and well worth a try!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 53 and I have some wrinkles and I&#x27;m taking Youtheory collagen supplements.  I purchased this product based on the incredible customer reviews.  I&#x27;ve not noticed a huge change with the cream.  I think it&#x27;s a nice cream with a light scent but no SPF.  I&#x27;ll use it up but I don&#x27;t expect to purchase again</li>
    <li> Can I tell you that I love this moisturizer? I first ordered it back in 2011 after doing a bunch of research into non-greasy moisturizers. My skin was getting a lot drier as I got older, and wrinkles were multiplying like rabbits! I&#x27;m not going to say that this cream has erased my wrinkles, but I will say that it helps keep my skin from looking like a dried-up prune. I use it every single day before I put on my makeup and couldn&#x27;t be happier. That first jar lasted me until 2014 -- maybe it&#x27;s not even good to keep it so long! But when I order this one, I started to worry that it won&#x27;t be around when I need to order another jar in 2016 or 2017!</li>
    <li> It is a big bottle , a bottle can be used for a long time , and the product is very good , I liked it</li>
    <li> Again, Yes. This stuff is awesome. Has awesome ingredients. A HUGE jar that has literally lasted forever. Feels so light and absorbs right into my skin. I use it at night and I have zero complaints at all. Does what it says! Will certainly continue purchasing this.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  Allowed my husband to use some for dry skin on his arms and even he praised it.  Wow!</li>
    <li> This product is hands down my favorite moisturizer out there and it is reasonably priced. I have combined it with this amazing skin serum [[ASIN:B00NJ9W3XQ VC20 - Potent 20% Vitamin C Serum with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; a Powerful Amino Acid Complex! ]]  as the ingredients vitamin C and hyaluronic acid have been featured on Dr. Oz as miracle products to help you look younger. The combination of these products has given me amazing results, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Good quality, light moisturizer.  Love the smell and lightness.</li>
    <li> My face was getting dry due to the summer weather and my body lotion (I have been using it on my face) was not cutting it anymore. I used this product for a month and it works, my skin is soft like a banana peel.</li>
    <li> Soft appealing smell, great price for the amount that you get, and moisturizes without clogging my pores. I put it on in the morning and overnight. This is my new go to face lotion.</li>
    <li> i only bought because because i saw on Dr Oz that this is as good as any. Probably is. i have spent hundreds on Serums that you have to purchase several other things with to make it all work together and you dont even get a moisturizer with it. However i only gave it 2 stars because because it made my chin break out with a few zits. Im in my 50&#x27;s and havent had any of those since i was a teenager. So maybe a little to greasy for me. Also the next day i notice my forhead is oily all day. But hey thats better than dry. Especially at my age.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer! i have combination skin and It does not feels greasy at all. I prefer using this at night, right after i apply my face serum. This is probably one of my favorite drugstore products ever! Also, besides the amazing price, this lasts A LOT. Normal face creams contain no more than 2oz and this one has 10oz so you do the math!</li>
    <li> The first day I used this - my skin &amp;#34;drank&amp;#34; it in so I applied it a couple times.  The next day, only once.  Now I am putting on in the morning and once in evening after bathing.  No problems with product.  I&#x27;m 48, I&#x27;ve only been using this for 4 days so not a lot to say right now.  Other than, no allergic reaction, no irritation, etc.  So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  1/19/2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still using this daily - I have to use this in the morning now because if I use it at night after a bath, my fiance&#x27; says the smell is too strong (perfumey) for him.  But I&#x27;m still using it daily because I like the way it feels on my skin and I like the way my hands do not look dry/aged anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  9/2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still using this after a routine I do every morning and evening - if you look at my reviews you&#x27;ll see a couple other facial products I use before this and finish off with this moisturizer.  I like the way this makes my skin feel - it&#x27;s not tacky&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  10/2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this twice a day - morning and evening.  I keep a bottle in bedroom and one in downstairs bath in case I forget to apply or just feel the need to apply again.  This is the only cream that does not make my face feel rubbery, tacky, sticky - very nice - like apply soft water and the skin soaks it up - happily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 6/27/16:  I use this every morning and evening.  Love this moisturizer.  Feels so good - my skin loves it and I will continue to use this.  I&#x27;ve been asked to try other products at a discount and I always go back to this one.</li>
    <li> I used to use this moisturizer every day when my face was clear and acne-free.  However I have struggled with adult acne for the past few years and this moisturizer did not have the same effect it once did.  It has a wonderful smell but sometimes goes on &#x27;wet&#x27;.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like my skin absorbs the moisture as well as I&#x27;d like it to.  I think it is an affordable cream and would work best for someone who doesn&#x27;t have sensitive/dry/acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> This is a thin facial cream that works good for the price.  You must use a clean spatula or immaculate fingers as to not contaminate the product with germs.  A tube would be much better than a jar container.  I hope the manufacturer is listening.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer! I&#x27;ve been using this for years and so pleased with how my skin looks.</li>
    <li> I am 50 and this product works great. I am very allergic to scents and this does not bother me. I have dryer skin and this is just perfect - not too greasy. I use it every night and do not use anything else. My skin is not very wrinkled (I stay out of the sun) and this helps keep it that way. I will continue to use this product. The price is great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light and refreshing.  So far it hasn&#x27;t taken 40 years off my face, but one always has hopes.  I&#x27;ve always had good luck with St. Ives products and this is no exception.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay...not as moisturizing as I thought it would be. No irritation, though, and as with all st. Ives products,  a good bargain.</li>
    <li> I tried this on a whim and have no regrets. I am in my 50&#x27;s.  This stuff is awsome.  I was spending a lot of money on expensive moisturizers every month and this cream works better than any of those expensive items I was purchasing.  after two weeks I noticed a difference in the overall appearance of my skin and fine lines have diminished.  Now that 3 months has passed I continue to see results.  I use it both day and night.  One jar lasts two to three months.  I rub whats left over on my hands, elbows and arms and it works wonders there too.  For the price it&#x27;s worth trying.  You will notice a remarkable difference in how your skin looks and feels.  Good by to the expensive stuff.  I&#x27;m using this forever.</li>
    <li> excellent as advertized</li>
    <li> This was just about the best six dollars I&#x27;ve ever spent- anywhere! I&#x27;m kind of picky when it comes to skin products,but I liked the overall review enough to give it a shot. I&#x27;m so happy I did! I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now, with noticeable improvement of my skin. My pores appear smaller, my skin is glowy, and feels so smooth after I apply it. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin (I have comb/oily-sensitive skin) at all or leave it greasy. I use it at night on my face and neck, then in the a.m. pre-primer/foundation. My makeup is actually going on WAY better. You will not be disappointed. Buy it.</li>
    <li> My daily moisturizer now awesome stuff</li>
    <li> Nice moisturizer.  I think this container will last me a lifetime.  Leaves my skin smooth and conditioned.  I have sensitive skin, prone to acne and this product does not make me break out.</li>
    <li> soooooo cheap n  hard to fing these in stores a;ways sold out. smells great and it pretty big</li>
    <li> It moisturized my skin above normal and lasted for a long while along with making my skin feel lifted. I would buy this product again</li>
    <li> makes your skin look nice and healthy, don&#x27;t know much about the anti aging stuff but for the price, hey why not.</li>
    <li> Love it! It is a very light feeling cream that soaks into the skin without making you feel greasy or sticky. It is awesome at moisturizing the skin, body or face.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for years.  Love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my cheap &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; moisturizer when I cant afford a high end brand.  It&#x27;s good enough - you get a lot of it for the price and it does not irritate my skin - I keep this as a beauty reg staple.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it everyday.  It works great. It even helps with  my acne.  Highly recommended for those with oily skin</li>
    <li> I bought this after seeing reviews from Dr Oz show. I was using a product that cost 5 times more and switched to this. Gad I did, I use daily prior to placing my makeup.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many facial moisturizers.  From expensive to midexpensive dept store brands, to drug store, to a few natural products like Burts Bee&#x27;s.  I had issues with my skin either becoming too dry for the firming or breaking out.  I am so glad that I decided to buy this after reading the reviews.  Light scent to it, airy, light, sinks right in.  I have only used it for the past 4 days but have to say that my complexion is so much better.  No breakouts, face has a bit of a glow to it (in a good way not oily).  I use this along with their microabrasion scrub and Burts bees Rose Attar serum for fine lines around my eyes or blemishes.  Great quality for the price.  Lesson learned that I don&#x27;t have to spend hundreds to get a quality moisturizer (when even those failed me).</li>
    <li> I sure hope it the long-term effects are as great as the short-term. My skin is way softer in the am if I use this in the pm. And, there&#x27;s no parabens, it&#x27;s cruelty free and it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
    <li> I got this for my hands, i thought if it is good for your face why not treat my habds. All I need is a little at night before bed and I don&#x27;t feel like if I touch anything I will leave a mess behind.</li>
    <li> I live in a very dry climate and my already-dry skin suffers from this. I was looking for a moisturizer that would come in a size that would last and for a price i could afford on my almost college-like budget. I found this and decided to give it a try. I did find it odd that for a Collagen/Elastin product, those two ingredients were listed dead last on the ingredient list....  Overall i don&#x27;t have too many complaints, it did the job, is light and leaves my skin feeling relatively healthy, but the moisture didn&#x27;t last all day and soon i&#x27;d have flakes and dryness all over again halfway through work. I chalked this up to slacking on my daily water intake. I later bought Jojoba Oil to add to it as an experiment in the effects of natural oils. So far no huge complaints.   Lately i&#x27;ve noticed that the skin around my eyes sometimes gets very dry, sensitive, and sometimes red and irritated. I have not been able to figure out if this is from the moisturizer itself, the oil i add to it, or some other outside factor, as i use the combination on a daily basis and the irritation only occurs from time to time.   I have since bought a new natural vitamin E facial moisturizer that i&#x27;m going to try, but i keep this stuff tucked away just because it&#x27;s a fair deal. It&#x27;s great for when you&#x27;re in a pinch. Just don&#x27;t trust it to be your miracle cream!</li>
    <li> more like a hand cream than a face cream. ok for normal skin and less pretentious complexions. dont expect miracles</li>
    <li> Honestly, I&#x27;ve been in search of a good facial moisturizer for well over 10 years.  I&#x27;ve never used anything, expensive department store brand to drugstore brands, that has made such a good impression on me as this particular St. Ives moisturizer.  To give you an idea of my routine and skin type: I wash my face, exfoliate (3-4 times/week), then moisturize. This is important because no matter what moisturizer you use, you must have clean, exfoliated skin to maximize any kind of good result.  My skin is a combination of dry and oily.  I started having trouble with fine lines (33 yrs. old) about a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about the moisturizer when I opened the tub is it&#x27;s consistency.  It forms stiff peaks like whipped cream and is as smooth as silk.  Not too watery, not too thick.  Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a previous reviewer (E.D.Head) said so well, \\&quot;The minute you apply this it is a part of your skin.\\&quot;  It sinks in with long lasting softness and zero greasy feel.  It maintains the balance of my combination skin well.  A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pleasantly and lightly scented.  Great when your nose is right there to smell what you&#x27;re rubbing in on and around it.  It didn&#x27;t trigger my allergies, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my fine lines, I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to know whether it will diminish them. However, with my skin looking so healthy, the lines look healthier, too.  HA - I&#x27;ve got healthy lines on my face vs. unhealthy.  I don&#x27;t know any other way to describe it, but they are somehow better.  Try this and see for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus: My fingers that I use to apply this with felt so much better than the rest of my hands with which I use Aveeno body lotion.  I could tell where the St. Ives moisturizer had sunk in and where it didn&#x27;t felt so much worse.  So now I use a little extra to rub into my hands when I&#x27;m done.  What a difference.  Having nice hands is a bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a keeper and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 28 year old male, with thin, sensitive skin.  My complexion is clear and mostly smooth with larger pores on my cheeks on either side of my nose.  In warmer months, I have normal to oily skin and, in colder months, I have tight, dry skin, especially around my chin, nose, and forehead.  I am a smoker.  When I turned 18, I had my first major experience with dry skin.  At the time, I was bathing with a bar of soap, including my face.  I developed a red, flaky rash around my chin and upper lip that winter, which was embarrassing.  I had no idea why it occurred and went to the doctor, who prescribed antibiotics and steroids which did very little.  In fact, using the steroids for more than a few weeks caused steroid induced dermatitis everywhere it had been applied.  I began using Spectro Jel and then Cetaphil exclusively on my face (and body wash to bathe), and the rash faded and never returned.  Within the last couple of years, I&#x27;ve simply been using a sensitive skin body wash tailored for my body and face with no problems - usually either Dove Men or Nivea.  Still, every winter, I develop tight, dry skin, which is mildly flaky (but not rashy, like before) around my chin, nostrils, and between my eyebrows.  The creases around my nostrils and upper lip also become slightly red, like wind burn.  I decided to try a moisturizer with some reluctance because I&#x27;ve always been afraid that adding anything to my face that isn&#x27;t a cleanser will cause a break out.  I&#x27;ve had bad luck in the past with moisturizers doing this and ultimately why I swore them off for years.  Sensitive skin is a gift and a curse.  On one hand, my skin is very soft and smoothly textured; on the other, it&#x27;s hard to balance the need to cleanse to prevent blemishes and the need to moisturize so dry skin doesn&#x27;t occur.  I bought this product based on reviews, which is always a gamble.  So far, I am very satisfied.  The moisturizer is light and once it goes on it does not feel heavy on the face.  The odoris slightly medicinal but does not linger when applied.  My face is feeling moisturized and supple.  Problem areas, especially the outsides of my nostrils which are always the tightest, are no longer dry, tight, and flaky.  I haven&#x27;t experienced any reddening, either.  No blemishes so far - I have been applying the moisturizer for the past 4-5 days.  Even the creases on either side of my mouth seem filled in and smooth - I always thought &amp;#34;fine line repair&amp;#34; was advertising fluff for older, wrinkly women wanting to look young again.  I will update in the future.  So far, so good.  **Update - 5/6/15** I have unfortunately downgraded my rating to three stars.  I used the moisturizer sporadically over this past winter.  The honeymoon period - when I made my original 5-star review - quickly wore off.  While this product does moisturize well, it started to cause blemishes for me, even with light use.  It does not irritate my skin but it clearly clogs my pores.  So, for those with oily or combo skin and prone to blemishes, I would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay lotion.  It didn&#x27;t really WOW me or anything.  I did have a big problem with it though... I usually put it on in the morning, and by 2pm my eyes really start to sting.  I made sure not to put any near or around my eyes because this has happened more than once.  Happens every time I use this lotion without fail.  I can&#x27;t really comment on it&#x27;s \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot; capabilities because I can&#x27;t really use it daily.  Overall, it&#x27;s okay.  Not a huge fan of the scent, or it&#x27;s effects on my eyes by the afternoon.</li>
    <li> Applies well, smells good. Hydrates skin well. I apply it at night and it does make my skin feel refreshed.</li>
    <li> I gave this rating because this product met all my requirements which are:&lt;br /&gt;Excellent quality!!&lt;br /&gt;Good price!!&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery!!&lt;br /&gt;Above all &amp;#34;It works perfectly!!. Since I started using it, my facial skin started looking glowing like a baby skin.&lt;br /&gt;This product is awesome!!&lt;br /&gt;I would recomment to anybody who want to look younger because it really works.</li>
    <li> Seems smooth and creamy. BUT it seems to be giving me more blackheads than I had before I started using it...</li>
    <li> If you are looking for something for your dry skin, this is it!!! Also, with such a cheap price and big volume, the quality is still super good!!</li>
    <li> This product has helped with wrinkles, but not really natural ingredients.  It feels like it was made in a lab with different chemicals.  Not my favorite.</li>
    <li> Very nice face cream. I&#x27;ve been using it for  a while now and I really could see an immediate change in my skin texture. It absorbes into the skin quickly so you do not have that greasy feeling. When it&#x27;s gone I will definitely re-purchase some more..</li>
    <li> I will never go back to expensive facial moisturizers... My skin is now so soft and hydrated. I felt the difference the next day! Been using it for 2 weeks now... So far my skin is loving it. Thank you, St. Ives.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 30 year old male and have found that this is a great facial/neck lotion.  I did a lot of research and found the concerns about mineral oil may be a bit overblown.  Thus far I have not had any break out&#x27;s on my face from this lotion.  I have oily skin so I just apply when my skin is a bit dry after showering.  One thing,  I put this on my arms and some got on my underarm area and the next day it caused me to break out pretty bad.  After that I decided to use [[ASIN:B005OKPZR4 St. ives body lotion, naturally soothing oatmeal &amp; shea butter, 21oz]] for my body and it works great, no breakout issues!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This absorbs quickly and has a great clean smell, just keep it on the face/neck.</li>
    <li> segun las recomendaciones debo esperar al menos 3 meses de uso para dar mi opinion ,,, si que me toca esperar !!! luego les cuento</li>
    <li> Great lotion - my skin is sensitive and this gives excellent moisture, but doesn&#x27;t irritate. A must have for any lady.</li>
    <li> love this!! leaves your skin/especially the face silky and moisturized. I use this daily and can see the difference. Would not hesitate to tell everyone to try this!!</li>
    <li> Fine moisturizer - I use this daily after my morning shower and then get dressed.  I then follow-up with a thicker moisturizer with sunscreen.  Works great and leaves my face looking soft and smooth for the whole day.</li>
    <li> I was a bit nervous when I first tried this product. I had always used L&#x27;oreal products, so I was a bit out of my &amp;#34;comfort zone&amp;#34;.  After using it for a week, I realized that my skin felt and looked just as moisturized as it had with the more expensive product.  I am very pleased with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I only bought this product to have enough for the free shipping, but I like it so much, I will definitely buy it again. It makes my skin so smooth. I put it on at night to let it soak in. Nice fragrance also.</li>
    <li> I love this super thick St. Ives lotion.  I have ridiculously sensitive skin and have to avoid a lot of anti aging lotions.  This one doesn&#x27;t bother my skin at all.  I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to tell if it really makes a difference, but I like it for daily use nonetheless.</li>
    <li> i found that it just sat on top of the skin, which made my skin oily and gave me a fair amount of white heads. i typically do not have this problem. ended up using it as body lotion.</li>
    <li> Due to the climate lately (dry, windy, and cold), my skin has been icky as all hell. I&#x27;ve been slathering this stuff on my face before bed and I wake up glowing.</li>
    <li> i just bought this stuff because i see there&#x27;s a lot of good reviews about making ur skin soft for acne oily etc. and since my skin have no wrinkles or some kind of that but they sometimes have some dry spot in here and there and some kind of oily, and i have acne (not much) cause im still young. i used it and my skin and then my skin is more soft and my acne scars is less visible! god this is amazing even my active acne is more and more visible! love this stuff</li>
    <li> Cream was good for normal skin. But it just wasn&#x27;t what I needed for my dry skin. Great price too.  Thanks Deborah</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used the regular Collagen Elastin body lotion on my face until I saw this product.  I switched over and this lotion works great and smells great.  Sometimes though, I put some on and my face is still dry; I can chalk that up to winter weather dryness. Then I just apply a second coat and that usually helps.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for about 2 weeks and really like it so far. I have sensitive skin and have not broke out using this at all. It is light weight and not greasy. The best part about this product is that it was only $5 and the tub is huge! I can use it generously on my face, neck, chest and hands w.o worrying about using up the product too quickly.</li>
    <li> Bought this product so I could try it and I didn&#x27;t like how it made my skin feel. Anyway, my husband loves this product &amp; he uses it all over his face and body. He looks really good, skin feels supple &amp; product lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> My sister is 32 and her skin still looks ridiculously young thanks to using this moisturizer. After noticing how radiant and youthful her face is, I decided to try it myself. Mind you, she has a normal fair complexion and I have an oily T-zoned dark one.&lt;br /&gt;It made a huge difference for me! I simply loved it! It is hard to find it here in Los Angeles, but I finally found on Walmart and bought two.&lt;br /&gt;I put morning and night, after applying a serum, on my face and neck. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, it doesn&#x27;t take long to dry and my face is smoother to touch.</li>
    <li> What a bargain St Ives Collegent moisturizer is. I have been using it for a few weeks. No compaints yet. I really do not see a difference in my skin. But its really to early to tell.</li>
    <li> Boy this stuff just feels great on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really that simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light.  Very subtle, pleasant smell.  It is my favorite face lotion now.  It just seems to soak in without sitting on the top of the skin.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in time, but the box was open.Nothing was missing, item was closed and untouched :).So far I like it Very Much :).</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer you can buy for this price!</li>
    <li> The tub is huge that the cream comes in.  It is scented and isn&#x27;t offensive but weirdly enough, what you would expect a face cream to smell like.  It fades away so no biggie.  Absorbs well and softens skin amazingly.  little goes a long way even though it is a lighter consistency cream (not super dense).  Great value.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream for my wife. She is very satisfied with it! It absorbs very quickly, smooths and moisturizes skin very good. The jar is very big and she uses this cream not only for her face, but for all body and hands.</li>
    <li> I have not had this face lotion for very long, but I think it&#x27;s a keeper!! I love the smell of it and it is such a lightweight face lotion!!  I noticed my skin feels firmer already!! Def will purchase again!!</li>
    <li> Was great. Arrived earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell or leave my face oily. Which I love since I have acne and sensitive skin. It also has been helping with making my makeup stay on my face all day! My skin usually gets really dry and flaky during the winter, but since I started using this I have not had any problems. I&#x27;m very pleased with it :)&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention its a ton of moisturizer for such a inexpensive price!!</li>
    <li> II have nooo idea how I&#x27;ve been living without this moisturizer! It is amazing and I highly recommend it to others who have problems with dry skin, it truly is a lifesaver. I&#x27;ve never had my face feeling so soft and moisturized during the fall and winter months. At first use I was afraid that it might be kinda greasy, but after using it for a week now I gotta say it&#x27;s not at all. And it&#x27;s soo cheap for something that&#x27;s 10oz! I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> The downside of this is that it doesn&#x27;t moisturize! It leaves my skin feeling really tight &amp; dry. It is a big container but its not even worth putting on my hands as lotion</li>
    <li> When I received the moistuizer, it was expired.  I bought this in October and the expiration date was in June. I don&#x27;t eat food that has expired and I&#x27;m not going to use a product on my skin that has expired.  I thew it in the garbage.</li>
    <li> I have been using this fabulous cream for many years as an extra on top of my regular creams, after sports ,or after bath,I love it,.and recommend it</li>
    <li> Feels light on my skin.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this moisturizer.  It is packed with all the good stuff and really affordable.  I have oily skin so I use this for a night face cream and a daily cream for my neck and chest (an area that is too often forgotten in skincare.) The tub lasts me a good 6 months. So worth it!</li>
    <li> Has improved the softness of my face.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a moisturizer specifically with elastin in it. I bought it, let my mother try it, and she&#x27;s hooked on it. She uses it on her face and body. She&#x27;s gone through more jars than me. It definitely moisturizes your face. It does NOT make your face oily. My face looks hydrated after using it .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a firm believer in St. Ives since I was a teenager. I started using the St. Ives Apricot Scrub two times a week in high school, and haven&#x27;t looked back since. I had never used any of their other products when a friend of mine recommended this collagen skin moisturizer, after I told her I was searching for a substitute for my expensive night cream that I could no longer afford. I read through the reviews, and ordered a jar online. After a week of using it, I can honestly say that this is a great product that everyone should use. I put it on my face before I go to bed and when I wake up I have really moisturized skin. I only have to use a light moisturizer in the day time that doesn&#x27;t clog up my pores.  The most important thing about this moisturizer though, is that it goes perfectly well with my tea tree oil that I use for my cystic acne. Basically, I start my skin regimen by washing my face with face wash and then twice a week I use my [[ASIN:B00U1J83SQ TreeActiv Anti Acne &amp; Rosacea Treatment Sulfur Mask Plus Rhassoul, Bentonite Clay Mask with Witch Hazel &amp; Aloe Vera - Refreshing Lemon Scent (1 Jar)]], and then use my extractor with the oil to attack problem areas on my face(by the way, [[ASIN:B00LFT0CEO TreeActiv+ Tea Tree Oil Acne Solution for Advanced Acne Treatment - All Natural Acne Spot Treatment - Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back!]] :this particular brand of tea tree oil face products are AMAZING). After this, I use the collagen skin moisturizer right before bed, and I&#x27;ve been waking up in the morning with really good looking skin, and I&#x27;ve been having less breakouts as well. I recommend this product to anyone who needs something ultra hydrating to wear at night, as well as to anyone who uses the tea tree oil products.</li>
    <li> I happened to stumble upon this product by pure accident.  I was actually looking for the Apricot Scrub and they did not have any left.  This product was right next to the Scrub and it caught my eye and I just picked it up and bought it.  For some reason I assumed that it was also something you wash your face with and didn&#x27;t bother to read the instruction before using it.  Once I saw that it did not feel right as I was washing it, I then read the instructions and the actual label and saw that it was a moisturizer, oops!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Anyway, today was the third day of me using this product and my skin feels just like a baby&#x27;s.  It felt this smooth from the very first time I used it.  I did not have any reactions to it yet, but I would assume that would have happened by now.  I am just amazed by how smooth this makes my skin. I wake up in the morning with a fresh face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I was using Pond&#x27;s moisturizer before I bought this one, so I still put that on after this one absorbs because I will not let it go to waste.  Plus Pond&#x27;s has SPF protection.</li>
    <li> So disappointed in this after reading all the reviews..  I keep putting it on over and over and my skin still feels so dry.  Unfortunately I purchased 2 jars.</li>
    <li> This cream works well on my face, neck, and hands</li>
    <li> These ingredients are sooooooo TOXIC.  I would never put this poison on my face.  It is full of petroleum based ingredients.  Phenoxyethanol is banned in Europe and is a central nervous system depressant.  Propylene Glycol is related to Anti-freeze.  Dimethicone is also petroleum based.  Fragrances (parfums) are unknown synthetic chemicals.  Linalool is a skin irritant.  I mean, why don&#x27;t we just go to the gas station and splash motor oil all over our bodies? There are so many toxic ingredients in this it would take an hour to go over all of this.  Please, women, educate yourselves.  Go to EWG SkinDeep to research ingredients.  Don&#x27;t buy toxic skincare products.</li>
    <li> Soft, velvety sensation, perfect for every day use. Pleasent smell. Price is unbeatable</li>
    <li> I really wanted it to work for me since I can&#x27;t afford expensive creams and this one had great reviews for the price. And actually, I loved it for the first 3-4 days. It has a pleasant smell, doesn&#x27;t leave any grease on face, the skin feels very soft and smooth right after you apply it. BUT, after a few days my skin started getting progressively drier and my eyelids became red and flaky. I have a normal to dry skin, but never red-flaky dry. It&#x27;s winter and I live in one of the driest states in the US, so maybe this lotion is just not for this time/location. I switched back to Nivea Soft, which at least doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin so much. Will used St. Ives as body lotion until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> This is no longer available in stores, so I&#x27;m very happy to find it here, and at a lower price than I used to pay.</li>
    <li> Due to the outstanding reviews, I purchased this product.  I like it!  It makes my skin softer and brighter!!  I use it 2x a day, sparingly as a little goes a long way.  I have rated only 4 stars because I am not seeing some of the fantastic results as some of the reviewers.  I was hoping for more moisturizing results.  Will probably purchase again.</li>
    <li> So far I love it! My face tends to be more on the oily side and this Moisturizer absorbs well.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday and it is the best moisturizer i have ever used. I only need about a dime size for my face and neck. It also lasts forever! I bought it several months ago and im still not halfway done with the container. I know I will purchase again. Theres nothing like it! :)</li>
    <li> Ugh. I can&#x27;t stand it when products claim to be full of beneficial ingredients, but when you look at the ingredients list, those things are only barely there. There is only a very tiny amount of collagen and elastin in this product -- certainly not enough to really cause any significant changes in one&#x27;s skin. If you look at the ingredients list, the Hydrolyzed Elastin and Hydrolyzed Collagen are listed as the 18th and 19th ingredients. The main ingredient in this is mineral oil, which will definitely moisturize your skin but isn&#x27;t necessarily GOOD for your skin, because it forms a film on the surface of your skin that can not be absorbed, thereby blocking the pores and the skin&#x27;s natural respiration.</li>
    <li> This is not the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve used but it does the job AND it is reasonably priced!!! I would get it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and really like it.  It&#x27;s lightweight and does a nice job of smoothing out skin before I apply makeup.  I don&#x27;t believe it has any long term effects, positive or negative.  Also, it feels really nice going on my skin.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer!  I always have this in rotation.  Most nights I pat on some of this stuff after exfoliating and wake up with super soft skin.  You can also use a light amount for daytime moisturization but there is no spf so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this moisturizer more preventatively (since im not yet 25) so I can&#x27;t comment on any effects on wrinkles.  I can say that my overall skin quality seems better and brighter.  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> feels good on the skin, had for months, jar lasts a long time, alot of lotion for the price, i do notice a couple extra blemishes when i use it, as i just use it 2 times a week due to that..it may just be my skin, it breaks out easily. still a great product, i guess if i used it more often i could tell you if it helps fine lines. i just like it as its more of a natural product to use.</li>
    <li> This St. Ives lotion really does moisturize my skin very well! I am very satisfied with this product and have bought it more than once!</li>
    <li> Smell - sort of almond, quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizer - very watery when put on face, but absorbs quite fasts and lasts a few hours fine, not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Reduce the appearance of fine lines - NO!!! it does not work, but this is less than $5, so I am fine.</li>
    <li> I love the texture of this moisturizer.  It&#x27;s light and absorbs easily, which is exactly what I was looking for in a summertime/high humidity moisturizer.  It does have a light scent to it, but it&#x27;s pleasant enough and fades pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to change up my skin products now and then to suit things like changing seasons and activity levels, and this is a great price for a good product.  It didn&#x27;t make me break out and is light enough to use under makeup.  Pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> this is not what I expected, should have been better but as they say you get for what you pay for...that is all..</li>
    <li> I actually gave it a try just because it&#x27;s a best seller and the price can&#x27;t be beat. But it turned out very good. I bought the 10oz and the container is really huge. The cream goes on smooth, not sticky. It has very comfortable smell, not kind of flowery smell. I have used it for about a week and I think my skin has been improved a lot. I will definitely buy this again</li>
    <li> St. Ives products work well and give so much quanity compared to $30 an ounce competitors.</li>
    <li> Great product! Very smooth, no real odor. Absorption is good, non-greasy. a little goes along way.</li>
    <li> INEXPENSIVE ENOUGH TO USE ALL OVER WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT THE COST. YOU CAN MIX A SCENT WITH IT IF YOU WANT. CAN USE ON FACE, BODY, HANDS. USE MORE THAN ONCE A DAY. NON-COMEDOGENIC.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. When I received this I was surprised at the amount it was, so surprised I thought I ordered the wrong product. I thought it was a body lotion and not a face lotion. Upon looking at it, it said face lotion. Most all face lotions are tiny. After using this a few days, I really like how it feels. I am over 50, getting dry papery wrinkled skin and it&#x27;s becoming more difficult to keep it soft. This is exactly what I was looking for, just nice baby like skin, or a young girls skin. I don&#x27;t expect miracles from any lotion, but this was a nice surprise. And, because it comes at such a great price and large amount, I decided to try it on my arms. My arms haven&#x27;t felt so soft in a long time, I kept feeling my arms all day. No slick feeling, doesn&#x27;t disappear needing to reapply throughout the day, just soft baby like skin. If I were to use this just on my face,neck and chest it would last me a lifetime, but I can use this all over. Also, you only need a small amount. I am Super happy with it. I am finally ready to change products. I have used Aveeno for years and had been very happy with it till lately, I have been having to reapply it later in the day because my skin would start itching and flaking. As we get older, I&#x27;ve noticed that many lotions do not absorb or totally disappear, and it gets more difficult to find a balance.</li>
    <li> Great cream!  Love it and see a difference in using it!</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy for my skin. It keeps my face moisturized through out the day. Smells kinda nice too. It was really well priced. I do wish it was in a tube or squirt bottle to avoid getting lotion on the lid.</li>
    <li> this is a very nice moisturizer  creams i m using it from the last five months and like it a lot. perfect for skin, would surely recommend this</li>
    <li> After reading reviews that this was one of the best bargains for an effective moisturizer I decided to try it.  I am not that impressed with it.  It is a little too heavy for me - it stays shiny on your skin for a while.  It smells kind of funny, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to make my skin feel all that moisturized.  I definitely haven&#x27;t noticed any of the &#x27;collagen&#x27; effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One good thing though - It is in a nice big tub - so it does last  a while.</li>
    <li> Collagen Elastin, good stuff, but mineral oil is one of the worst if not the worst oil for your skin. If the company had used a natural oil, like coconut, olive, almond oil this would have been a great product but not mineral oil. Research mineral oil. Bad stuff. Surprised this product got such good reviews. Mineral oil does not allow the skin to breath, it increases the photo aging of skin, It dissolves your skins natural oils which causes the skin to become more dehydrated. Mineral oil is petroleum based, synthetic oil. Once it is absorbed it is broken down in the liver and intestinal tracts where it steals valuable vitamins from the body which will not be replaced. So this is bad stuff, stick to natural oils.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. It has a clean smell, a generous amount of cream, and my skin feels great the morning after I use it!</li>
    <li> Light cream, not grease. Great for a combination skin. The price is very cheap for the amount of cream. It lasts a long time</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product, its so light and quickly absorbs. Has a pleasant scent to it.Plus the amount you get for the price... you cant beat it!!</li>
    <li> A lot of product for a small amount of money! No greasy feeling after use. I will probably purchase this again.</li>
    <li> really nica and smooth. not heavy or greasy. have rosacea and have lots of problems with different products. this does nobreak my skin out and is very efficient at taking care of  the really dry areas of my face.</li>
    <li> I like as a moisturizer for my hands/chest but NOT for face.  Makes my sensitive acne prone face break out because there is mineral oil in it.</li>
    <li> So I read half of these reviews and gave it a try....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does moisturize nicely especially with bad winter skin... but alas I am now having bad allergic reactions so I cannot use anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have quite as sensitive skin I think you would enjoy, but it is thicker and better suited as a night cream than a daily wear!</li>
    <li> I bought this based off the rave reviews. I&#x27;ve used it for 4 weeks now. It works better than other moisturizers I&#x27;ve used. My skin feels softer and looks smoother. Glad I found it.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer has a nice light scent and has not irritated my sensitive skin.  Goes on smooth and soaks right in.  Can see a slight difference in my skin already!</li>
    <li> For my sensitive skin, this stuff is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;Every other morning, I use CeraVe moisturizing facial wash.&lt;br /&gt;After daily showering in the morning, I apply coconut oil and after that soaks in, apply this moisturizer. Is a lovely combination, especially for these dry Wisconsin winters.&lt;br /&gt;At night, I use a damp, warm washcloth to wipe any dirt off my face, then use Retinol Cream (vitamin A) on forehead lines and acne prone areas - wait 20 minutes - then add a hefty layer of this cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using St. Ives products since i was in my 20&#x27;s and love how affordable they are...that and the fact that this stuff actual works! My husband bought this stuff on a whim,just to see if it would help with razor burn. I started using it and loved what happened to my skin. Those tiny little lines that appear in your late 30&#x27;s seem to fade, my skin looks healthier and firmer. I have sensitive skin so harsh ingredients make my skin really red and raw.That never happens when i use this. We like this product so much we just bought 5 more jars!</li>
    <li> I never write reviews on any products, however it is a must for this product and the full line of St Ives.. I am 61 years old and have been using the collagen/elastin product since I was in my early 30&#x27;s...I have never used another product on my face for moisturizing except this product, even when it was not in the present container...there have been times that I have driven out of my way to find it when it wasn&#x27;t available in the store..The product never leaves my face feeling greasy..if I go outside and sweat I never have to worry about the product running and stinging my eyes...Again I am 61 and people think I am in my 40&#x27;s .... It is a great product and would recommend it to anyone and I have many times (my daughters also use it)..</li>
    <li> I have used this moisturizer for years and then all of a sudden I could no longer find it in the stores.  I have super sensitive skin and the pump version has a perfume scent that is not in the jar but the name is the same.  I was so glad to find this on Amazon.  It is so light and does not bother my skin at all.  Great for the winter, it is light and easily absorbed and it keeps your skin from getting so dry from the heat constantly running.</li>
    <li> Love this. I purchased it for my husband. He used it and I have repurchased it multiple times. It has a pleasant fragrance, but not too much for my manly husband. :)</li>
    <li> I alternate my facial moisturizers - and this one is in my top  favorites. The smell is fabulous and it does not leave my face feeling oily.</li>
    <li> Good price for such a great product this is it ladys I will buy more when i r un out</li>
    <li> My sister and I have been using this for only 7 days and the results are just amazing! She is a few yrs. younger than me and had just started to get some light wrinkles on her forehead and around the eyes and she is amazed that they have all gone and along with the age spots she had! I have deeper wrinkles but they are already miminized and the pores I had are gone! She told me last night that she is using it all over and that her skin looks awesome and feels like it did 20 yrs. ago, so I started trying it all over too! Folks this stuff is the best and believe me I have tried all that is out there and I have never had results like this ever!! It the price is so affordable and it is alot in that jar, only takes a very small amount, it goes along way! I love love this cream!!!</li>
    <li> I just started using this, but I really like it so far - and I love that it is for both day and night use.  Makes it simple.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle moisturizer and I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in the softness or color of my skin.  It is a nice container that the label pulls off of easily and looks pretty on my counter.  I doesn&#x27;t have any SPF so I will probably continue the hunt for a good day time moisturizer and use this one at night.</li>
    <li> Very light weighted and smells very good. However, I feel like it&#x27;s not moisturizing enough. It is not expensive at all for it&#x27;s volume, good buy.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really use this on my face but its a wonderful light moisturizer for the body. This breaks me out every time I put it on my face. Will be good for summer as a body lotion. Very light.</li>
    <li> I love st. Ives products! The best lotion I have ever used. I&#x27;ve been using the collagen elastin body lotion for years and really wanted to try this. I couldn&#x27;t find it at the store so I bought it here. I&#x27;m so glad that I did! Feels amazing! I use it overnight and under my makeup.</li>
    <li> Not many moisterizers can be found on amazon.  Most that can be found are small tubes for a high price.  I am still testing this one but so far happy with it.  Skin seems soft but not oily.  Large container and not a high price.</li>
    <li> St. ives Facial Moisturizer applies very smooth and greaseless, with a pleasant scent. It comes in a large container which should last at least a month or longer if used daily. This moisturizer contains collagen/elastin which fills pores or small wrinkles on the face and neck. For the price, it is an extraordinary value. I highly recommend it, and will definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I always thought I never needed moisturizer because my hair gathers oil fairly quickly, so I just assumed I had oily skin, too and because of that I never used anything on my face besides cleanser. Lately, though I have been frustrated by my makeup application - my foundation looked cakey and dry around some places and good in other places. Finally, I thought I would try a moisturizer to improve the quality of my skin. I saw this one was top rated, so I bought it. I love this stuff. Already, I can see an improvement in my skin. It looks more moisturized and I don&#x27;t have any dry patches around my nose. My skin looks more glow-y. I can&#x27;t say about the collagen and anti-wrinkle properties because I&#x27;m twenty-one, but I love this stuff as an everyday moisturizer. The scent is light and lovely, too. Some people have complained about the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a seal on it, but I&#x27;m not really concerned about that. My product had nothing wrong with it and a lot of drugstore products don&#x27;t have seals on them. I&#x27;d recommend this moisturizer to anyone - it&#x27;s cheap and it&#x27;s worth a shot!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this product for myself but my mom ran out of her face cream. So the good daughter I am, I let her use mine and she fell in love with it and took it away from me. I was shocked but I just purchased another one but from Wal-mart and it pretty much cost the same amount there and amazon. SOooo, I&#x27;m thinking of just buying 2 or 3 so I can have one for back up and if my mom runs out I have an extra one for her, I know, I know, I&#x27;m really a good daughter.</li>
    <li> No complaints whatsoever so far on this moisturizer.  I use it mainly at night or when I&#x27;m going barefaced during the day.  I have been on a plight to find inexpensive substitutes for high end creams and this definitely suffices.  I am forty-two and my skin has changed in recent years, some patchy dryness and tightness after washing ... and this quells those issues.  I will definitely buy again, prompt/intact shipment and inexpensive!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for about two weeks though i had instant results but my skin is tighter and my complexion is even.</li>
    <li> This product has given me amazing results and I am definitely sticking to it! It really makes me feel and look younger. My face becomes ore and more supple and smoother every time I use this and I&#x27;ve never felt better about how I look than I did with this product.</li>
    <li> When this came in the mail, there was not a seal on outside or protective anything on inside. Therefore I had NO idea what was in it...lotion, yes, but for safety reasons, I threw this away. I would not recommend this product for that very reason. i could have sent back I guess, but didnt feel like messing with it at time. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> It has got  a mild scent and it is light. Its&#x27; not too sticky or greasy.I would put it as just right.</li>
    <li> It is a very refreshing cream.  At the moment you are applying on your face you feel it really a cold cream. I cannot talk about the results yet. I have started just a few days ago and cannot say much. But I like it so far but I am using it combining with Collagen cream and a night serum. Probably I need more time to give an accurate review on this cream.</li>
    <li> I liked it so much that I ordered 2 more of the same to gve to friends to try. smooth</li>
    <li> I Love this cream; I search high and low to find it. This is a hard to find item but well worth the search.&lt;br /&gt;I use it with (after) Dickinson&#x27;s Original Witch Hazel Oil; it makes for a perfect combination and super soft, clear skin.</li>
    <li> I took me years to get my adult on set acne under control and once I did what do I do? Add this to the mix and mess my face up all over again. I LOVE St Ives so this is not a slam piece at all, this face moisturizer is just not of any kind of quality. First the ingredients in this cream suck, there is not 1 positive ingredient in this mess. If you want to say collage and elastin work for the skin then you can, but they don&#x27;t. It is impossible for those molecules to penetrate the skins surface. The only way to fix a collage issue is to eat better, to eat foods that help produce collagen and protect the skin. Secondly, mineral oil is the second ingredient, this is a no-no for most people. I am assuming this is what made me break out like a teenager. Lastly, it is not moisturizing nor does it embody any vitamins that have been actually shown to improve ones skin. This is the first St. Ives product I have had an adverse reaction to but since Unileaver bought them I am sure there will be more upsetting formulas and formula changes to come.</li>
    <li> this thing is like magic for your skin. from the first use, you will notice a big difference. your skin will be glowing and will look healthier.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this I expected about half of what actually came. This really leaves your skin feeling great! I never used lotion, but then I really noticed my face drying out and decided to give this a try! Glad I did!</li>
    <li> Use this wonderful, light, creamy elastin collagen face cream after a tri-peptide/collagen-elastin serum like Essence2Beauty or Aria by VisioElan and watch YEARS vanish from your face. All are terrific for under the eyes, too.  As of yesterday, I&#x27;m using this on my body as well because St. Ives&#x27; elastic collagen body lotion smells AWFUL!  This doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I got this for my face, but also my stomach after childbirth. I&#x27;ve been using it a few days. The smell is like cheap hotel lotion and the texture is too. Kinda watery. It does make your skin soft. I&#x27;m not too sure yet...need to give it more time.</li>
    <li> Use this on my face in the morning as a moisturizer then apply make-up. You can definitely see the difference when i have this on! I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles but i might as well start taking care of my face now, right? hahaha anways I love this!</li>
    <li> Good face lotion for the price, I see no reduction in wrinkles or fine lines but for an all around face moisturizer for cheap it works great.  I am a 30 year old male and have tried several other types and the &amp;#34;men lines&amp;#34; that are starting to be offered.  This is the best deal for the price.</li>
    <li> Now I&#x27;m not quite sure if this is preventing any overnight wrinkles but it is a refreshing lotion I look forward to applying every night. It leaves a shiny residue but eh, it&#x27;s worth it and only when you sleep. :)</li>
    <li> this moisturizer was posted by Dr. Oz on his show.  it&#x27;s as good as the expensive formulations sold in high end stores.  you need this &amp; you must buy it now.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have now added DMAE to this cream and wow it truly works wonders for little expense. I am very pleased....</li>
    <li> Very nice moisturizer</li>
    <li> The best moisturizer, while applying its feels very cool and its works through out the day, even summer time also.</li>
    <li> Being a college student on a budget I&#x27;m always on the prowl for inexpensive effective skin care products; this moisturizer fits the bill. Though I&#x27;m only 23 I firmly believe in maintaining and preventing wrinkles before they set in. When I came across this product I didn&#x27;t have high expectations. The price, claims, and amount of product you get seemed too good to be true. After using this for many months I&#x27;m a super happy customer. If you&#x27;re looking for a moisturizer that does a great job without being greasy or heavy, this is perfect for you! The scent of the product is also very very mild which is great for sensitive skin like mine.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! I have very dry skin and I love the way my thirsty skin feels when I slather this on morning and night. I use it on my face, body and hands; the light scent is lovely, not overwhelming at all. I&#x27;ll definitely be back for more!</li>
    <li> I have the typical T-zone oily problem and dry everywhere else. I love how the cream absorbs quickly and does not leave a greasy feel. I read all of the reviews before ordering and I do not find the problems that others have had. It does not dry my skin, feel oily nor cause me to break out. I do not mind the scent at all...in fact I do not really notice it. When I ordered, I did not pay attention to the size....I thought I was getting a typical drug store 1-1.5 oz. size so I ordered two. Imagine my surprise when 2 huge tubs appeared!  The price is unbelievable.....I have tried other very expensive creams that did not work as well. I am glad I like it because I have enough to last me a year!&lt;br /&gt;As for its effectiveness with fine lines and such, it is too early for me to decide. I will update when I have given it more time.&lt;br /&gt;8/18/13 Update:&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for about 4 months. I can not say that it is a miracle worker BUT I would say that this product is equally effective as products 5 times more expensive. I am used to paying $15.00-$20.00 for 1 oz. of face cream. I would have to buy about 2 a month. It took me 4 months to get through this...I could have made it last longer but sometimes I used it as body lotion as well. I have to say the price for 10 ounces of the St. Ives is worth every penny. It did not do any better than the more expensive creams....but it did not do any worse either.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it  would do. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years now. It is awesome,I feel as if I can&#x27;t do without it on my face. My children love how my face looks with it. It&#x27;s not in Stock now for next month&#x27;s order,I&#x27;ll cry if I have to use something else on my extra sensitive skin. I&#x27;m giving one to my twin daughters,they&#x27;ll love it. I&#x27;ll recommend it to my friends on Facebook and instagram. Please bring it back around the same price as well. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have the type of skin that definitely needs to be moisturized daily, because I get dry patches if I don&#x27;t. This cream works wonders for this purpose! I haven&#x27;t had a single dry patch since I started using it. I can&#x27;t really say much about a reduction in fine lines/wrinkles because I&#x27;m 19 and don&#x27;t really have those yet, but my skin is well moisturized and feels better than ever! I have been using this not only on my face but also on my arms, and it has somehow cured small bumps that I have had on the sides of my arms for a few years. Also, another bonus is that this is inexpensive and will last forever! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months and I still have about half a tub left. The only negative thing I can say is that it makes my face look oily right after I put it on, but that happens with most moisturizers. I only use moisturizer at night for this reason, and with this one my skin stays hydrated throughout all of the next day!</li>
    <li> It does have a slight scent which is pleasant. I like the way it goes on the skin. Don&#x27;t need to use much at all. Does work to help diminish line slightly. I&#x27;ve only used for short time and will see how it improves over time. You do need to use it daily to get the benefits from what I observed.</li>
    <li> I needed a moisturizer for my skin and ran across this product. The price was reasonable ,I find that it smoothes my skin and does not leave it greasy. I also combine it with my makeup to blend. I won&#x27;t buy anything else.</li>
    <li> I love this facial moisturizer, this product give me an soft feeling on my face. I have very dry skin and it works perfectly and It won&#x27;t clog pore or give an oily feeling. I recommend to anyone who has dry skin.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and I like how my skin feels after I put it on my face. So adorable:)</li>
    <li> Normally I love St. Ives, but this product just doesn&#x27;t have a texture I particularly like. It goes on and feels more like an absorbing face mask than a regular moisturizer. I put it on and want to wash it off right away! It doesn&#x27;t feel like it does much of anything either. I&#x27;ll likely either start using on my legs or toss it. :( It&#x27;s really quite disappointing.</li>
    <li> This is a smooth slightly runny formulation that has little if any scent that goes on smooth and with such a large jar, it is a good cost effective way to add moisture to your skin.</li>
    <li> Love the product it is Great. I will definitely order more when I am out of this one. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> For the price, this product is nice but it didn&#x27;t seem to provide enough moisture for me. After a few days of using it, my skin felt dry after washing (I have semi-oily skin) and I found myself going back to my old moisturizer. I would definitely recommend using a separate cream for your eyes as well if the moisture-level is OK for the rest of your face.</li>
    <li> Feels great! Very smooth and great for my sensitive skin.Tried many moisturizers in the past and this is by far the best.</li>
    <li> Okay. A tad oily after application but keeps face nice and smooth all day long and I&#x27;ve noticed my skin feeling (not really looking yet though) tighter.</li>
    <li> I was once a lizard, since using this product I have since become human. I recommend this to all reptilian life forms that wish to be human. I once got it in my eyes, I&#x27;ve had laser vision ever since. It can at times become a nuance, but I&#x27;ve found many uses for it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to preface this whole thing by saying, &amp;#34;Yeah, I&#x27;m a guy. I bought this. Deal with it.&amp;#34; Anyway, I had a couple weeks were I wasn&#x27;t feeling the best about my skin tone and was even more concerned about the lines that had started cropping up around my eyes due to stressful work days and sleepless nights. I did weeks of research on eye products before I bought anything. I looked at the 100$ a tube stuff, the off-the-shelf stuff, and everything in between. All in all, I&#x27;m satisfied with this products, but by no means am I seeing any outstanding results. It does what it should. It&#x27;s not overly &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;, absorbs nicely, but is rather thick. The size of the container is enough to last me at least 3 months using it once every morning. Would I purchase again? Probably not.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it really does all it claims, but its nice and smooth and smells great and was worth the buy.</li>
    <li> You get a lot for a steal. So I slather it on at night and wake up to nice feeling skin. I do think it&#x27;s a little heavy for day time. And when I try to use a little it doesn&#x27;t seem adequate. Which is why I slather it on at night. Great night cream. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for daytime though. Does leave the skin shiny.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a high-quality moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t break the bank.  I frequently use other St. Ives products and was astonished at the low price for this moisturizer, so I gave it a whirl.  After a couple of weeks of use, I can declare that I&#x27;m very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before ordering the moisturizer, I was dealing with several dry, scaly patches on my face.  My lighter moisturizer just wasn&#x27;t cutting it.  Using this product before bed renewed my skin after just three or four days.  Continued use has been just as great.  No breakouts, dry patches, or oily residue.  This facial moisturizer goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this product.  My skin is smooth, supple, and glowy.  Plus, the container is absolutely huge.  This is a great product for an incredible value.</li>
    <li> This is a good feeling moisturizer which goes on smoothly. It is easy to apply makeup over it. I would order this again, but wish I could purchase it locally.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Noticeable difference in scarring on face.&lt;br /&gt;Good job keeping skin moist.&lt;br /&gt;The tub has a LOT in it, will last me about a year (a little bit goes a long way/I have a small face)</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!..It&#x27;s a wonderful moisturizer that leaves your skin soft and smooth.  Not at all greasy.  I use it at night and during the day and it is much better than so many of those overpriced overrated products on the market.  I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 years now and it is amazing.  Slather on your face and neck and let it soak in.  Your skin will thank you.</li>
    <li> AMAZING. Just amazing. This Timeless collagen elastin lotion feels like a gel. A light weight, highly moisturizing, fast absorbing gel.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, this lotion feels like the Clinique gel lotion, but better, and Clinique is way over-priced. St. Ives isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;My skin soaks this stuff up, does NOT feel greasy or oily (and I&#x27;m someone who has overactive oil glands.) I also get clogged pores, and breakouts very easily. This lotion doesn&#x27;t cause me clogged pores or breakouts. I also apply it to my neck like the directions say to, and it feels tightening and really good.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m astonished by how much I love this lotion. I typically use Murad face lotion, but St. Ives is now my favorite!</li>
    <li> This is the product that I cannot live without during the winter months...so soothing and without the extra preservatives and additives of competing brands.</li>
    <li> This cream is thick and creamy so you don&#x27;t need to use that much, but when it dries its not greasy or heavy feeling but just nice and soft. My husband and I both use this and I can tell a huge difference. I was using Neutrogena visibly even before this and I gotta say my t zone is nowhere near as oily as it would get before. I wear glasses so I figured the glasses was rubbing the old moisturizer off because it was thin. This stuff is thick and rich. My skin is left silky after it dries and my face at first felt alittle numb after using but now 1 wk later there is a tightness or taunt feeling going on. I&#x27;m still kinda young though for what its worth.</li>
    <li> this cream its the best cream i had ever use, It so moisturizing and so creamy, i had been using it for close to 5 months and I&#x27;m on my second jar because my husband just love it so much too, i don&#x27;t care what ingredients it had, this cream works for me! so i don&#x27;t really care. we re all gonna die  one day and everything in life has a risk, like smoking, eating unhealthy using drugs or alcohol  this cream its not the exception, i say this because of many people bashing minerals oil which its one of the ingredient this cream has.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  My skin never feels too dry or oily. I am a 32 year old female and I feel it does help prevent wrinkles from showing.  Haven&#x27;t got any new wrinkles so I think thats a good thing!! Would highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I saw this cream on Dr. Oz and I highly recommend it. It cleared up my dry patch above my nose very quickly.</li>
    <li> I can tell a huge difference in my face already.  It&#x27;s so hydrating.  My face was dry and peeling before this and I used a moisturizer.  A definite winter staple.</li>
    <li> I love this facial moisturizer. I can use it in summer and winter. It even keeps up with the super dry, harsh Montana winters we have and keeps my skin feeling soft and not dried out. Plus, you can&#x27;t beat the price and you get a huge tub!</li>
    <li> Smooths on easily, not greasy and for the price and the Hugh jar ....you can&#x27;t go wrong. Will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Love It!!!</li>
    <li> I saw this product featured on the Dr. Oz show and decided to try it out.  What a great decision!  I love this moisturizer, it&#x27;s light and creamy, it&#x27;s not greasy, it just absorbs right into my face.  I have atopic dermatitis, so I have to be very picky about the products I use on my skin, and this does not irritate at all, in fact just the opposite, it&#x27;s quite soothing.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin so soft and dewy, especially in winter, placed this on subscription, so I will always have it!</li>
    <li> I returned this because I did not notice the main (second) ingredient in the cream when I ordered.... MINERAL OIL!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD for skin. Clogs pores and will cause acne for those of you that are acne prone! This is like mayonaise in a jar. No wonder they give you 11oz of this stuff for 8 bucks. I&#x27;m sure people do love the smell, texture of this product; but the bottom line is WHAT IS INSIDE the cream that counts. And mineral oil is a cheap product that has no business being on the skin- especially the face. It may be fine for baby&#x27;s (baby oil is 100% mineral oil) but not for the adolecent/adult.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this product - from day 1! My skin is super dry and my skin just soaks this moisturizer up. And, it is NEVER greasy. Yes, you need to give it a couple of minutes and then it is totally absorbed. Really happy with this product, and I won&#x27;t be changing anytime soon that&#x27;s for sure! Have always considered St. Ives to have superior, quality products so I was thrilled to find out they have a facial moisturizer. Yea!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I found it by watching Dr. Oz. The dermatologist he had on the show said it was great for the skin and the price is right!!</li>
    <li> Just as I had expected, St. Ives is indeed one of the best products when it comes to absolute skincare. It doesn&#x27;t cost too much, but you get high quality products that sure work great on the skin. This product incredibly works as a day and night moisturizer. I get up early in the morning, have a hot shower and put the moisturizer on while my pores are still open. By the time I get home and remove my makeup, I also developed a habit of moisturizing before going to bed. The results were amazing. I don&#x27;t have acne breakouts anymore and my skin surprisingly looks retracted and younger. The best thing about it is that it absorbs like magic on your skin and you wake up feeling fresh and just beautiful. The scent is also very light and sweet but not over the top. I recommend this product for every girl who has dry or oily skin. This works perfect!</li>
    <li> Just received my products last Saturday and did two home peels this week and started using this product. So far so good will post more info when it has been one month. Thus the four out of five stars to early to give five stars. Very fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2-26-13&lt;br /&gt;Still in love with this cream. I purchased because of the customer reviews and my opinion has not changed only gotten better.</li>
    <li> I use this product every morning and night, never feels heavy or greasy. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s in a tub, and not a tube.</li>
    <li> Do not believe the adds that state this is endorsed by Dr. Oz, this does not work well and is cheap for a reason.</li>
    <li> I wish I loved this product as much as I hoped I would.  But I just don&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s really smooth and feels great going on my skin but after it&#x27;s soaked in my skin still feels a little tight and dry.  This moisturizer is a great buy but I don&#x27;t think I will purchase it again because it just wasn&#x27;t as good as other products I have tried.  I will go back the last cream I tried, Alpha Hydrox Night Replenishing Creme.  That left my skin feeling really hydrated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 33 year old female with sensitive skin and wrinkles under my eyes and beginning on my checks when I smile.  I&#x27;m always very leary of trying new things on my skin due to possible breakouts.  I was in an impulsive mood and bought this item.  I used it the first night I got it.  The next morning I woke up and couldn&#x27;t believe what I was seeing.  My skin was smoother and my wrinkles less noticeable, but still there.  I also use proactive.  I&#x27;ve used it for years.  It&#x27;s been over 2 weeks and I&#x27;ve incorporated in into my am/pm routine.  This product is truly amazing.  I wish I had taken before and after pictures.  I didn&#x27;t think something so inexpensive could be so effective.  I&#x27;ve researched the ingredients and have not found anything carcenogenic in it.  I highly recommend this product.  I don&#x27;t know if I lucked out with my skin type or not but for the price it&#x27;s worth a try.  High costly products doesn&#x27;t mean great results.  This product is PROOF!</li>
    <li> I saw this product on Dr. Oz and decided I needed to try it. It is a lovely product, cheap and affective. I use it at night as it is very moisturizing but it hasn&#x27;t made my oily, acne prone skin break out. A must have product!</li>
    <li> Love this!  My skin has improved.  The darkness under my eyes is disappearing!  My skin looks clearer.  I also use it on my hands and the tiny wrinkles have disappeared.  My face looks lifted.  My neck has improved.  I pray they never stop making this product.</li>
    <li> I chose this because I was getting no great results with the moisture cream I was using from Avon.  Thought I&#x27;d try this - price was so a great factor - I use it twice a day and within ten (10) days there was a smoother skin.</li>
    <li> Noticeable difference in moisturizing my face effectively compared to the various lotions I&#x27;ve tried before</li>
    <li> I have been using Netrogena anti aging with not so many complements. Then i switched to this and it is fantastic.  My skin is very sensitive and I cant even where foundation, but this is light and nurishing on my skin. It tightens up fine lines and helps with my skin tone,  and now I received a ton on complements.</li>
    <li> It is used daily as a moisturizer. It barely has scent and it is refreshing. I especially love the fact that it uses natural ingredients. .</li>
    <li> keeps skin looking bright and feeling really soft.</li>
    <li> nice and light on the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very picky about what I put on my skin, it has to absorb right away. This takes longer to absorb, and feels greasy in the meantime. I don&#x27;t like that greasy feel with any type of lotion. But that&#x27;s just me</li>
    <li> I like the smell and level of absorption but can&#x27;t use it in my face.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very oily, but since I&#x27;m 30 I thought about moisturizing more. But unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work out. Ten minutes after I apply it my skin gets really oily and shiny...&lt;br /&gt;Now I use it in my neck.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and am limited as to what products I can use on my face.  Many are quite expensive! I have been successfully using &#x27;St Ives&#x27; facial moisturizer for a number of years, and continue to receive compliments on my skin!  It is a very good $$ value and this 10 ounce jar lasts for months!</li>
    <li> I bought this about a month ago and so far, so good. I&#x27;d say, for being so cheap, it works so well! I tend to dab some on in the morning after I use my cleanser and after toning. It leaves my face very smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of results, not much for acne, pores and whatnot (not targeted there anyway) but it terms of your face condition, it is marvelous. Again, my face is notably softer, less dry and much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would actually give this 4 and a half stars just because of the container. It would be more convenient to have it in a pump or tube.</li>
    <li> I also bought this product (along with several other beauty products) because of its high reviews. I love St. Ives products and use their apricot scrub almost every day as well as their body lotions. I was excited to read all the high reviews about this facial moisturizer especially since it came in a 10oz container. But as with most things, it was too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use to use (and have gone back to) Oil of Olay 7 facial moisturizer and its been GREAT for me for over 5 years. I have found that this St. Ives facial moisturizer leaves my face shiny and prone to more breakouts (I already skin on the oily-er side). But I have to give props where props are due, even though I don&#x27;t use it on my face anymore, I do use it on the rest of my body and it feels and moisturizes as great as any other expensive lotions Ive used in the past. This is especially important for me as I am prone to eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my verdict is, I wouldn&#x27;t use it on my face but would continue to use it on the rest of my body as it works great as a body moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this product, the quality is awesome and I can not beleive the price. Is a big container so I am going to use it for a long time. I got one for me and another one for my mom</li>
    <li> I like this stuff so far. My one complaint is that it is a little thin--it feels more water-based than oil-based. But for some people that will probably be a plus. I like a little bit heavier moisturizer to get me through the day, but this will be a nice change for days when I feel like using something lighter. It has a nice, natural smell, which is something my regular moisturizer doesn&#x27;t have. Also, you can&#x27;t beat this price. I mean, St. Ives isn&#x27;t expensive in the stores, but this is at least five dollars more at Target. Happy Moisturizing!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for myself and it was a good product for a much better price than in the stores.</li>
    <li> Saw this being mentioned on the Dr. Oz show a few months ago.....best Collagen in a bottle for cheap!!! really softens the skin.</li>
    <li> This is a very cheap cream oz for oz and it still works great. I&#x27;ve used tons of expensive moisturizers and if you don&#x27;t need a sunblock this is really the way to go. The body shop vitamin e cream seems to be slightly more effective but for 20x the cost it&#x27;s really hard to say the difference is that noticeable. Don&#x27;t get me wrong either this stuff works better or as good as everything else I&#x27;ve tried beyond that one cream and it&#x27;s close.  Everyday nighttime moisturizer this is a great option.</li>
    <li> i use this every morning and before bed, makes my skin feel amazing and refreshed! smells really good too, very clean and floral</li>
    <li> I haved used this product now for 2 weeks and notice my skin i nicer. My face is very smooth and has reduced some of my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I love this facial lotion! It really makes my skin feel soft! I put it on before bed 4x a week.</li>
    <li> excellent product, thank you very much ...</li>
    <li> i bought this product recently because in the past i&#x27;ve loved it.&lt;br /&gt;today i&#x27;m returning it. i just found out that St Ives is now owned by Unilever a company that tests horrifically and needlessly on animals. i will urge everyone i know to stay away from St Ives products. what a shame, but mostly a shame for the animals.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. It isn&#x27;t too oily but gets rid of the dryness. My skin feels very smooth and looks glowy after using it. I love that it is free of the harmful chemicals too!</li>
    <li> I bought a whole suite of facial creams and I love this one  The price is great for the amount you get and it&#x27;s smooth and smells nice.  Leaves my skin soft and doesn&#x27;t leave my face looking or feeling oily once it soaks in.</li>
    <li> This is so moisturizing and refreshing it feels like you&#x27;ve just splashed water on your face..but better. It has a nice light texture and light invigorating scent. It feels like your skin just drinks it up. I&#x27;m totally addicted to this. For the price (so cheap) and the huge tub, I use it everywhere even though it says it&#x27;s a facial moisturizer. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s making me more youthful...but this is a great lotion and I would recommend.</li>
    <li> First off you&#x27;re getting a huge bang for your buck. The jar is very large. I like this because I have oily skin and am experiencing the joy of fine lines now that I&#x27;m 35. It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy but moisturizes really well. I live on this it the cold north east winters. Can&#x27;t say it does much for firming or fine lines but if you&#x27;re looking for a good basic moisturizer, this is your ticket. For fine lines etc put some Retinol on before applying the st. Ives. Good product</li>
    <li> I purchased it because a lot of people around me recommend it for me.Very suitable for every family members to use.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t miss it!XD</li>
    <li> I love this cream after washing my face. It makes my face feel so much smoother and softer. It smells nice too! Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a lovely, cheap anti-aging facial cream. The product works, smells great and is cheap. What more do you need? Also, the container is huge and you only need a small amount. I use it every night on my face, neck and hands. I wake up with radiant skin. I hope St. Ives never stops making this product!</li>
    <li> I have naturally oily skin, and i like how it makes my skin feel, but later in the day, it does seem like my skin is a little bit more oily then normal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and I like it. It&#x27;s a pretty big tub and I don&#x27;t use very much at once,so it&#x27;s going to last a long time. I enjoy the light scent and while I haven&#x27;t noticed that it has really made a difference in my skin, I feel like it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> I use facial moisturizer several times a day.  Always looking for a deal.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this product and I am happy.  The value is wonderful.  It&#x27;s not oily and it does soak into my skin quick.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer.  Some moisturizers just sit there on your face and feel greasy.  This one actually soaks into your skin and leaves it smooth and refreshed in just a minute.  Will be ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> When I first noticed this unfamiliar, bulky jar sold for a few bucks at the drugstore, I assumed it was cheap quality. After all, it didn&#x27;t even have sun protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was until I saw it on my friend&#x27;s makeup counter. The friend with perfect skin, who is also very picky about her products and has tried many high end moisturizers before. She claims this one was a winner at a great value, and points out that sunscreen can be easily added using strong spf makeup. So, I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been almost a month now, and my skin is in love with this stuff. It has a light, pleasant fragrance that is probably due to the exclusion of SPF. It applies smoothly despite the semi gel texture. At night, I apply this all over my face and neck, and it gives me a healthy glow in the morning. In the morning, I apply this under my spf BB cream and spf foundation, and it does not mess with the makeup at all. It&#x27;s winter and I have not seen a single trace of flaking skin (which was a huge problem every other year). I have no wrinkles and do not use it for the collagen boost. However, it is a great facial moisturizer and you get tons of product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate the packaging. It does not even come with a scoop and becomes very unhygienic to use. My recommendation is to scoop some of the brand new product into a tiny travel sized jars and use those on a daily basis. This prevents contamination of the entire tub.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is not greasy, just right for my skin! And it smells great! I have and would recommend this product! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It is a nice, light moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t weigh skin down. It soaks in really quickly, and works great under foundation.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my daughter for a body lotion because it has mineral oil as one of the ingredients.  It was only $4.00, but mineral oil is not a good ingredient in skin care.  Glycerin should be one of the main ingredients for skin absorbency.  I do like St. Ives intensive healing body cream though.</li>
    <li> wonder full product for all ages who want to keep fine lines away and skin soft , smells very nice</li>
    <li> It is okay not quite the thing that Dr. OZ was going on about per my friend but okay and like most creams.</li>
    <li> Really works on skin and you will see a difference right away. Delivered on time. I do recommend to all that are willing to try but are afraid.</li>
    <li> I used this cream and found it ok. Not really moisturizing or anything.  I took a look at the ingredients and found an interesting substance. There is propelyne glycol in this!!! In other words, anti-freeze, which is an extremely toxic substance. Skin will absorb all this and it won&#x27;t do a thing for your skin except slowly poison you over time and wreak havoc on your complexion and face. Find something all natural or at least less toxic!</li>
    <li> Why spend $$$ on department store moisturizer when you can buy this on the cheap? This moisturizer is great under makeup or on its own. It has a mild fresh scent and is light in texture - never greasy. I have pretty sensitive skin and I have never had an issue with this product. It&#x27;s hard to find in stores, so I depend on Amazon to keep me supplied.</li>
    <li> Product feels smooth and after 4 weeks of using it, i started to see some difference...highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> It hasn&#x27;t caused me any breakouts or dryness, so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> All the skin care products were as expected.  Good products.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but I don&#x27;t use it every night. Thinking about doing a little more research on a better quality moisturizer for my skin type.</li>
    <li> Will never use another moisturizer again. The texture of this is just amazing. Its light, airy and creamy and has a very light scent. My mom also loves it. My skin had some dry patches and within a few months of using  my skin always feels so soft. The price is also unbeatable and it shipped perfect (no mess and came quick)</li>
    <li> Love this product. Feels so good</li>
    <li> Feels awesome on my face and hands! And the scent is mild and fresh.</li>
    <li> I purchased this wonderful cream while I was at my local Walgreens and I have to admit, I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything much with it - but with the reviews I&#x27;ve read here on Amazon and scattered about the web I decided to grab some and try it. I have to say, I am extremely pleased with the results so far, a week and a half in using as directed (morning and bedtime) and my skin is definitely feeling tighter and softer. I&#x27;d definitely recommend giving this cream a try, I love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this before it was on Dr Oz and so glad I did. I noticed a change in my face the next day.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It gives your skin a much more noticeable even tone, and moisturizes your skin and gives your face a nice glow.  It absorbs completely into your skin in minutes and doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of greasy or sticky residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a very large container and if I use it on my face twice a day every day I can imagine it lasting 3-4 months.  It&#x27;s less than $5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a faint scent of fresh flowers maybe, but it&#x27;s very faint and fades within minutes (which is good in my book).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product if you want to look your best and moisturize your face.</li>
    <li> It is very refreshing.  It lasts all day unlike other products.  It is not greasy and it seems to give moisture to all area T-Zone included.  I would definitely recommend it for dry skin and mixed dry and oily skin.</li>
    <li> I am 30 years old and my skin is more dry and prone to dryness that makes my complexion more &#x27;&#x27;non smooth looking&#x27;&#x27; and not very healthy because I also tan a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I had bought quite a lot of high end expensive moisturizers and also affordable drugstore moisturizers but found St Ives&#x27;s timeless skin moisturizer to be one of the best in terms of results and affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;The cream that comes in a generous medium size tub is lightly scented (decent smell) and goes on smoothly onto the skin. I could feel it literally melting into the skin as I apply it and rub it in. The result was almost instantaneous as I noticed my complexion has more of a healthy dewy glow to it and looked very hydrated. Something I noticed my past moisturizers did not do and also I had not experienced any breakouts on my sensitive skin. One thing I did notice, it sorta make me not look so sallow and tired and somewhat younger! I cannot vouch for everyone else but in my personal experience, I looked healthier and I would attribute this to the hydrated dewy glow this cream gave me.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product! Been using this for a couple of days but can see results immediately. Big kudos to the makers of this product because 1) it really works! If you want a healthy hydrated dewy glow to your skin, this is the one for you!! and 2) the price is unbeatable!, 3) It comes in a generous size.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy this again when I run out! xxx</li>
    <li> I suffer with very dry skin, especially during the winter. My nose peels, my chin peels, my hands/feet  peels... hey, everything peels. I tried lotions and moisturizers and exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;This product is great. I&#x27;m 22 so I don&#x27;t really need the whole &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; thing, but it makes my face so smooth the next day. And it&#x27;s HUGE. It&#x27;ll last me for a really long time. The only negative is that it feels a little greasy. It hasn&#x27;t clogged my pores or anything, though. What I do is cleanse my face, exfoliate, wait like 10 minutes, then use this product. I take a small dollop, rub my hands together, and put it all over my face, neck, and the excess on my hands or feet. I just hope it cures my dryness completely. Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> this product leaves my skin smooth and moisturized without feeling like I have a plastic coating on top of my face.</li>
    <li> THIS IS AN AMAZING PRODUCT! Not only did I see a dramatically great difference in my skin but it is cooling and fresh feeling to the skin.</li>
    <li> I initially bought this as a face moisturizer but I&#x27;ve been using it all over.  It&#x27;s great!  It really makes my skin soft and smoothes it out.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I am always looking for the latest and greatest skin care options and spend hours checking out reviews on various websites. If something works I will try it and find a way to pay for it!! I have tried so many but this past winter noticed my skin was exceptionally dry. I wanted something that really moisturized and this got great reviews and it made my skin feel so great! The best part is bc the cost is so low and can lather on and repeat throughout day without feeling guilty!!! I highly recommend! I am 45</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful moisturizer for my face.  I even use it on my eyes, instead of the expensive eye cream that I used to buy.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smoothly, and soaks into my skin leaving it feeling smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I saw this on the shelf in Walmart for under $5. Since I was buying something else on Amazon, I bought here for $6. I tried it today for the first and love it.  The cream feels light on my fingers and my face. I have tried a number of St. Ives and they are usually good quliaty.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It does a great job.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It&#x27;s really done a number on my forehead lines. Some reviews mention that the cream clogs pores. I use a toner before application and it&#x27;s worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> Makes my neck itch. Was going cheap but i believe it has too much fragrance. Love it dor my arms and legs. If you want something for your face that won&#x27;t break you out try ceraVe. It&#x27;s 10 dollars and great for the sensitive face</li>
    <li> This is the best moisterizer that you can buy for soooo cheap. Your skin feels VERYYYYY good and looks a lot better. It also smells great.</li>
    <li> Perfect daily facial moisturizer, and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for almost 2 months and I love it! I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s been any &amp;#34;elastin&amp;#34; effects, I haven&#x27;t noticed any, but it&#x27;s lovely to put on at night. And you get a ton of it for your money - a great value. I was buying Oil of Olay night cream for about 5x the price, but I&#x27;m going to switch to this.</li>
    <li> Not sure about any tightening it does but I love how it goes on. It is light and not greasy. I will be buying again</li>
    <li> A big can of ah, what a surprise!She and cheap, easy-to-use, affordable!Absolutely perfect!Vomiting blood recommend!Hope amazon launched a little more to this kind of product!</li>
    <li> A little too light to adequately address really dry skin but its so fluid that it goes on well. I use at as a body lotion when the weather is warm. Its goes on wonderfully and hydrates fairly. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have always loved St. Ives products, but they are hard to find in local stores.  This moisturizer works very well for me.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate or block pores on my sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve had no problem and I am so las Amazon is carrying it .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve lost about 35 lbs in the last year. Not a ton, but enough to cause some sagging and wrinkling in new and annoying places! I&#x27;d gotten depressingly shriveled looking in certain places. I started using this on my face, neck chest and stomach. I figured it&#x27;s so inexpensive, I can afford to use a lot!  While not a miracle worker, (sagging is probably here to stay, unfortunately) it&#x27;s really helped smooth out that shriveled look in the chest and tummy area.  Guess it just kind of plumps up that outer layer of skin. It&#x27;s subtle, but I&#x27;m still quite pleased with it. And, it feels nice and lush and refreshing spreading it on after a shower! No complaints here.</li>
    <li> This cream is cheaper than others but it moisturize your skin like no other.  It&#x27;s light and not oily, perfect scent.</li>
    <li> Giant jar of quality product. I took a chance with this purchase and I&#x27;m glad I did. It&#x27;s lightly fragranced but it doesn&#x27;t interfere with the quality of the cream. It&#x27;s light and absorbs relatively quickly. Cheap but nice.</li>
    <li> best moisturizer in a big container!</li>
    <li> I live by this product. It is the most economical moisturizer I have ever bought and the best one. I live in Miami-Fl, the weather can get extremely humid and make your face look shiny reason why I wash it a lot. This moisturizer absorbs immediately, I usually combine it with my concealer and it leaves my face soft and even. I got my husband and brother in law hooked to the collagen. Great buy!</li>
    <li> For the price, this can&#x27;t be beat.  I&#x27;ve tried many other, pricey brands, and this does the trick as well, if not better.</li>
    <li> For me, this product is used as my morning moisturizer (live in Southern Cal, so moisturizing along with sunscreen is essential).  This moisturizer has worked much better than other (more expensive) brands such as CeraVe (absorbs into skin nicely, but not very moisturizing) and Cetaphil (doesn&#x27;t absorb as well, sits mostly on top, and gives a nice shine to face).  Personally, I have a history of skin issues related to acne (yet, thanks to a wonderful dermatologist it&#x27;s starting to clear up).  This collagen moisturizer from St. Ives is the only one that smoothly absorbs and gives all day moisture for the skin (especially considering that I&#x27;m on Retin-A and this can be drying to the skin).  After applying this moisturizer (liberally and all over the face) I follow it with my sunscreen (Elta MD)...the two together are amazing and make for a perfect foundation for make-up application.</li>
    <li> St. Ives never lets me down and that&#x27;s why they will always be my go-to brand! I have combination skin with few big break outs, my skin can sometimes be sensitive but I think that&#x27;s normal. Any product I&#x27;ve tried from St Ives: face washes, make up remover or their moisturizers, I&#x27;ve never had an adverse reaction or break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wear a heck of a lot of make up on my face, so for the thickness of this lotion it doesn&#x27;t bother me to use it during the day. It feels a little greasy going on, but it sinks it pretty fast, it leaves me with a dewy glow. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, it&#x27;s clean and fresh. Most collagen elastin products have the same scent IMO. This jar is friggen huge! It&#x27;s a great value, great price for the size and quality of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Random extra things about this item: it&#x27;s a white lotion, it&#x27;s in a plastic jar, sometimes the lotion gets gunked up on the inside of the lid and around the opening but nothing terrible, it doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes at all (some products make my eyes water and sting if I accidentally get too close to them)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> St. Ives, I remember growing up with this product and thinking \\&quot;Why is it so cheap?\\&quot; I don&#x27;t know ;-) but I really really (really!) like this cream.  I don&#x27;t use it on my face but I used it on my body and I add coconut oil (refined/virgin) to it and it&#x27;s really smooth on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;What I like....&lt;br /&gt;1. Cheap&lt;br /&gt;2. Natural soft scent&lt;br /&gt;3. Very soft and moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;4. My go to body cream&lt;br /&gt;5. NOT heavy - easily add essential oils and or coconut oil to it to increase the absorbancy and enhance the scent&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27; like...&lt;br /&gt;1. I can&#x27;t use it on my face or rather I choose not to - it&#x27;s not rich/creamy enough on my face but I have my Alba Night cream for that ;-)</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is fine.  It does make your face feel very soft but I am not sure the collagen is working for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the fantastic reviews on it and it did not disappoint! What a great moisturizer. I use it daily and it keeps me moisturized all day. (: Such great value as well! I&#x27;ll continue to buy this. Not sure if the collagen helps at all... but i&#x27;m only in my 20s, so maybe that&#x27;s why.</li>
    <li> I been using it for two weeks but doesn&#x27;t seems to have effect on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see any difference.&lt;br /&gt;Good price and big cream though.</li>
    <li> I use St. Ives every morning before I apply make up. My best friend advised that I must use this verses purchasing all the high dollar products I was over consumed with. So far I have no complaints, also you get this larger jar for a modest price compared to a 1.7oz for $100.00, you can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> This is a huge jar. A much better buy than the ~1.5 oz bottles that go by in a month or two. It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue on my skin and smells naturally floral. I haven&#x27;t used long enough to see a change in my skin but so far, so good!</li>
    <li> I know there&#x27;s no such thing as a &amp;#34;miracle product&amp;#34;, but after all of the hype created by other satisfied customers, I admit that my expectations were high.  On my skin, this product acted as a very basic moisturizer. I used it after my PM cleanse and upon waking, my skin&#x27;s appearance was just okay....not dry, but not moist or plump, or refreshed, just okay.  After a week or two, I returned to using a small amount of plain mineral oil on my face, and began using this cream for my body.  Now I&#x27;m itching constantly, and this has been the only change in my routine. This didn&#x27;t work out for me, so I will not repurchase, nor continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several moisturizers over the years and have felt indifferent about them all.  I&#x27;m now in my 30&#x27;s and purchased this product do to the great reviews.  This product is fantastic.  It absorbsl quickly, doesn&#x27;t make me greasy, and leaves my skin feeling as soft as my baby&#x27;s.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love this St. Ives Facial Moisturizer with Collagen Elastin.  Two women I never met before were seated at a table together with me.  Were talking about facial wrinkles and skin care.  I asked them how old they think I looked.  After about 2 minutes of looking at my entire face up close they guessed 28-30 years old.  I will be 60 years old this year. They didn&#x27;t see any wrinkles on my face.  Thank you St. Ives!</li>
    <li> I used this many years ago and haven&#x27;t seen it until now.  I used to get compliments on how soft my skin was before I started using this product, then I noticed my skin got soft and smooth enough for me to notice.  I&#x27;m much older now, and need that collagen.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these face creams for my grandma and we didn&#x27;t notice that they both were expired 11/2013. please make you sure you check. I made the mistake of not checking on time and I went on a trip to NIcaragua to visit my grandma and that when I noticed that they both were already expired. it&#x27;s annoying that i spend money and also it was a gift that she can not used because they were expired...</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive and even the &amp;#34;for sensitive&#x27; doesn&#x27;t do as well as this does. Light, goes on smoothly (great for neck and cleavage! ladies don&#x27;t forget this spot!) So many people think I&#x27;m 8 to 10 years younger than I am, because of my routine of staying out of the sun and using this morning and night!&lt;br /&gt;BUT DON&amp;#34;T BUY THIS HERE!!! I bought here for less than 5 dollars, now 10??&lt;br /&gt;Local drug store had it for 5.&lt;br /&gt;People are right &amp;#34;PRIME&amp;#34; is only a way to jerk up the price more! Shame on you Amazon!!&lt;br /&gt;Do some comparison pricing, and you will see how high your price is! Just because it is here does NOT make it a good price!</li>
    <li> I am 63 and was looking for a skin care product that would be clean and refreshing while enhancing my skin. Living in a dry climate requires good moisturizing frequently. I apply it after shaving in the morning and it absorbs quickly. When I return home and rinse my face in the evening I reapply and it soothes my skin immediately. I have used many products much more expensive and it works far better than any others I have tried. It is creamy and applies easily with no messy residue try this stuff it really works.</li>
    <li> bought this for myself as i have extremely dry skin (due to age and hormone prob) but i find this 1 works best for slightly younger skin. My prob is i find that it is not easily absorbed by my skin</li>
    <li> Great product, the money for this comes out of my grocery budget.</li>
    <li> I use this every night on my face before bed. Leaves your face feeling clean in the morning, without a heavy scent. Is not greasy and it seems to last forever.  Smoothes out fine lines and wrinkles and leaves your face fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think St. Ives make the best products at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and feels like it may take just a small amount more of time to absorb in than most other facial lotions. That being said it works so well I think I may never buy another moisturizer for my face. :3&lt;br /&gt;One of the best prices for a product of this category also.</li>
    <li> I liked this as a basic face lotion, at first. Big jar and low price. But dont keep it more than a year, it is starting to irritate my face. This lotion is nothing fancy, is definatly not all natural. But its lightweight and high water content.</li>
    <li> Fast delievery , feels nice on skin but smells strange ..</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this as a facial moisturizer because of the scent (I&#x27;m prone to break outs) but I love using it on my skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but I feel like I need to share how awesome this product is!  For a few years I&#x27;ve been a loyal philosophy customer, swore that I&#x27;d never use anything else. Fast forward...I started to fall out of love with their popular hope in a jar moisturizer. It started to make my combination skin greasy feeling and caused my skin to breakout from time to time. It&#x27;s also very pricey, so I decided to search for something else. I had read great things about this product and I figured for under $5 I&#x27;d give it a shot. I&#x27;ve been using it about two weeks or so, twice a day and my skin looks and feels fantastic! Seriously! For at least a decade I&#x27;ve had problem skin...breakout prone, sensitive, uneven tone, oily in some places, dry in others. My skin is none of those things now. It&#x27;s clear, soft, my time seems more even. I&#x27;ve always felt like I&#x27;ve had to wear makeup to cover up my skin and for once in my life I feel like I could go without foundation! This stuff is amazing - I&#x27;ve definitely found my new moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product in December and still have half of the tub remaining! I have been 100% satisfied with the quality and quantity of this moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;As a 21 year old, who has this far in life neglected to take care of my skin and moisturize it properly, St. Ives Facial Moisturizer has been amazing. I apply this to my face/neck twice a day! I like the smell and it isn&#x27;t to oily! I don&#x27;t feel like I have seen a huge improvement in the small wrinkles under my eyes but the rest of my skin looks so smooth and has a glow that it never has!&lt;br /&gt;I actually can go without makeup now...and the real shocker...my husband can tell a difference!</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to trying this out after all the great reviews. I am 35 with normal skin usually no acne problems, but this really did the opposite for me. My pores look larger and I have some breakout with this since I started using this a few days ago. I really hoped to like this but it is not a winner for me.</li>
    <li> A bit heavy on the skin, and not as effective as expected.  Kind of disappointing, since it was meant to give a nice texture.</li>
    <li> I wish I could rate this lower than one star. To those of you that made comments about this product having a subtle fragrance,(etc.) - I have to guess that you must chain smoke cheap cigars, wear big box store perfumes, soaps, hair products and were born without noses. The list of chemical ingredients is long and scary and the aroma sickeningly strong and very unpleasant.    There are Counties in the United States that have banned any kind of scent in public. This s***** would qualify.</li>
    <li> I dont know if I just love it because I read everyone else&#x27;s reviews and it got in my head that it&#x27;s as miraculous as I think it is but I really do think it makes a difference in my skin. I have very dry skin after I had my daughter and I used every expensive thing I could find and nothing works as well as this. And I&#x27;m pretty sure it will last me a very very long time</li>
    <li> Smells good and feels nice but made me break out horribly. Moved on to Paula&#x27;s Choice products and haven&#x27;t looked back.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive and dry skin. The only products I used before was from Aveeno line. This one also does the trick. I already recommended it to my Mom and my friend. We all love it. It smells fresh and light, it did tingle first few times I used it but it didn&#x27;t cause any hives or splotches like all the other products I tried with added fragrance. I use it twice a day with &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; hand bcs it absorbs really quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought this after seeing on Dr Oz.  It is a good cream and very moisturizing.  I recommended to a friend and she bought it too.  I don&#x27;t notice any youthful effects but like I said it is a good, non-irritating creme that moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> I really like the feel of this on my face, and I am happy with this purchase. Thank you.  It is not greasy, but soaks in nicely.</li>
    <li> I love this nice, basic moisturizer. It absorbs well and feels great on my skin. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t contain sunscreen so I only use it at night.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! It takes very little and goes a long way! It is so SOFT that it makes you feel like your face is covered in water all day long! I have purchased $150 face creams and I will always buy this instead of those going forward. I am on my third jar!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best skin products I have used.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I got this yesterday and I was surprised to see how big it was. This thing is going to last me forever. I have dry skin sometimes. I used this last night before I went to sleep and this morning, My face was sooooo smooth. I am so happy I bought this.</li>
    <li> Still trying to figure this product out, i need to use it by itself, so far i is good.  Like it</li>
    <li> Wow, it is incredibly light and goes on smooth on the face.  I am not sure if it is working, but it feels nice and light.</li>
    <li> This cream is okay. I cannot say that I seen any changes in my skin. The price of this cream is excellent.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer, I have been using it for about a month though and have not seen any improvement in my fine lines.</li>
    <li> I lather this stuff all over me.  I am a runner so I get sun exposure in the afternoon but I fight back by smoothing this facial moisturizer on my face neck and chest.  Wait, I don&#x27;t stop there.  I use this on my legs for shaving.  I keep it on my side table and put another coat on my face at night also on my arms and shoulders for soft skin. Super cheap!</li>
    <li> I have already used one jar and sent away for another jar.  It is great and the jar is pretty.</li>
    <li> I have tried very expensive creams, like $50-$100 per 1-3 ounce tube. Nothing, no comments. Then, I used this for a month and people started asking me, &amp;#34;You are looking younger every day.&amp;#34; Huh? Well, I noticed wrinkles go away. Nuff said. Perfect consistency and just works. Don&#x27;t bother paying anything more.</li>
    <li> love this product.&lt;br /&gt;use this daily and my skin is velvety soft.&lt;br /&gt;I am in my early 60&#x27;s and my skin looks very youthful.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! Very moisturizing and leaves the skin with a glow. Also, product lasts me months on ends!</li>
    <li> This stuff is possibly the best moisturizer for face for the cost in the world.. I have stuff that works a bit better but it&#x27;s about 10 times the cost for the size. I use this day and night and use another moisturizer (jack black) for special occasions.</li>
    <li> As always, it arrived quickly and did not disappoint. I&#x27;ve been using St. Ives products for years with no complaints. After using their apricot scrub or after I remove my make up, I put this on and it hydrates my dry skin so well without being oily. You may want to use a little more than a usual moisturizer if you have dry skin like me because it is so light-weight, but it&#x27;s so worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even mix this with my foundation to sheer out the coverage and give me a bit more moisture when I need jt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really great.</li>
    <li> My face has never felt softer. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks so I&#x27;m not sure if I can speak to the results yet, but i&#x27;m loving it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this really works as a skin tightener but it&#x27;s a great moisturizer and is cheaper than what I used to buy but works just as well. It&#x27;s lightweight but still feels very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Not too greasy. Cheap face cream to replace my biolink face cream.</li>
    <li> What an amazing cream.  It leaves my skin soft and moisturized all day.  Even my husband uses it.  A little goes a long way and I&#x27;m sure this jar will last at least 6 months if used just on the face.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> To soon to see any changes.</li>
    <li> Does not work with sensitive skin.  It made my for head bright red and burned until I washed it off.</li>
    <li> I look younger in a matter of days and it did not irratate my skin.  Makes the skin look youthfull.  It is one of the cheapest creams on the market and it works better than those expensive ones.  I am recomending to all to buy the cream or better yet buy a few jars.  You only need to put a lite fingers worth on the forhead, each cheek, neck, and the chin.  Use very little.  I think you will be very happy with this cream.  A++++++</li>
    <li> very good facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> St. Ives is a good product - especially for the price. This is a light, sheer moisturizer good for normal, combination or oily younger skin. It works as a protective day moisturizer for normal skin that can get a little soiled from daily activities. It does not have enough moisture for dry skin. It has a delicate, very light, pleasing fragrance. Soon after application I forget I have it on. I like it very much for a day moisturizer or for hands and feet at night. Don&#x27;t expect reparative results. Collagen doesn&#x27;t soak into deep layers of the skin - certainly not in this formula. It would need a micro delivery system, and it is still debatable whether it can truly benefit the skin. In that case you would be better off to go with a different reparative product. I worked with a woman once that has been in cosmetics at Nieman Marcus for 150 years. :*) She says, &amp;#34;If she didn&#x27;t get her skin care for free, she would use St. Ives.&amp;#34; Not a bad recommendation there. For the price I give it 5 for sure.</li>
    <li> love this moisturizer</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and moisturizes.  No, miracle cure but it feel nice.</li>
    <li> I was worried about the mention of mineral oil by some other reviewers, as I have oily and acne prone skin. I had already ordered the product so figured oh well, I&#x27;ll give it a shot. Thankfully, no problems with acne or my skin being to oily! I really love that it seems to soak into your skin, not just sit on top of it like some other moisturizers. It also has a clean, refreshing smell to it which I like.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve given this product its fair shake, but in the end I just really don&#x27;t like it. The lotion is slippery-slidey, not thick and creamy, and it does not absorb all that well. Its oily, in short. Maybe it works for other folks but not for me -- and its also really difficult to close the container while juggling the bit you take out.</li>
    <li> The product \\&quot;St. Ives Facial Moisturizer, Timeless Skin Collagen Elastin, 10oz\\&quot; work quit well and for a fraction of the cost of some of the other brand named moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have oily skin but I am EXTREMELY prone to breaking out when using lotions, sunscreens, cleansers, etc. This, surprisingly, has not caused me to breakout! I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now so it&#x27;s safe to say that. It smells great and man! A little goes a LONG way! My husband jokes that this tub will last me for 10 years :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this for nearly 10 years, it is the best lotion I have been able to find.  I highly recommend this, especially for your face.</li>
    <li> I mostly use this as a body lotion because it is so cheap.  I have put it on my face a couple of times.  It is good for the price but don&#x27;t expect miracles.  It is ok for dry legs and arms as a light lotion.  It has a nice light scent and goes on easily.  I would buy it again just because it is cheap and I use it in between some of my better lotions.</li>
    <li> Im yet to see any result. I was told this is a good cream. It hasnt damaged my skin in any way. I will revisit this review and update it in a couple of months.</li>
    <li> Light and fluffy like whipped creme..an amazing moisture product at a very reasonable price...last at least six months when used twice daily....very little required to cover face and neck</li>
    <li> I had this given as a present from a work colleague&lt;br /&gt;within 3 wks of using this product people were commenting on how smooth and youthful my skin was looking&lt;br /&gt;it is so good that I have since brought many containers myself and given them as presents to friends and family&lt;br /&gt;around the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wrinkles get less and less every month&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth a try</li>
    <li> Returned it with other items.  Have use this product in the past.  This is one of the best face products ever used.  It can be used in the summer time as well as the winter.</li>
    <li> Ok, trust me on this since I never really make a comment online about something.  I have to say that I have been using this St. Ives product for at least 18 years!  Obviously that tells you just how great it is.  I am 45 yrs old and to this day, whether it&#x27;s help from genetics or not, (or being a non-smoker), I really do not have any wrinkles on my face, thank God!  I truly believe St. Ives Timeless Skin has played a great part in this.  I honestly get told all the time that I have nice skin and no wrinkles, and I&#x27;m giving St. Ives most of the credit for it.  Friends have asked me often if I use anything on my face and I always tell them I SWEAR BY ST. IVES.  I&#x27;ve also been using St. Ives Apricot Scrub for many years, maybe just as long.  I love these products and will probably be using them for the rest of my life!  Btw, it won&#x27;t take 18 years to start the effect!  You should see a difference very soon after starting to use this product, but using it every day for so many years will only help that much more!  Have a great day!</li>
    <li> I love it. This lotion makes my skin very smooth. I put it on in the morning and before bed. I would totally recommend.</li>
    <li> This felt extremely disgusting on my skin. It was too watery and I didn&#x27;t like the fragrance. The worst part was it made me break out. I tried to keep using it but gave up after a few days.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Not harsh and seems to do a good moisturizing  job</li>
    <li> I am a very loyal St. Ives customer. I love and have loved every product that I&#x27;ve used of thiers. This product makes my skin so incredibly soft it took me by surprise! I didn&#x27;t realize the size of the tub that I was purchasing, but there is a lot here and I use it twice daily. Will I purchase this again, absolutely!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not been able to find this moisturizer in stores for a while now, and so turned to Amazon.  It was shipped promptly and arrived without incident</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like at all.  It&#x27;s thin and also makes me greasy feeling.  I feel I break out everytime I use it.  Will be sticking to my aveeno.</li>
    <li> This has been one of the better moisturizers I&#x27;ve used.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy and afterward my skin is noticeably softer.  You won&#x27;t need to use very much at all, small dabs here and there, the product lasts quite a while.</li>
    <li> Not bad, but not long term solution.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been reading the reviews here in amazon and I was interested to try this product.  So I bought one from a local store.  First application, I felt my skin getting itchy and some red spots appeared. I had to wash it off my face and neck. I don&#x27;t like the smell. It also feels a little greasy.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is really nice, goes on easily, and does not leave your face feeling greasy at all. I&#x27;m prone to breakouts but this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t clog your pores and has actually helped reduce the number of breakouts I get. The bottle is huge and will last me for a long time. This was a really great deal and you will not find this product cheaper anywhere else, trust me I&#x27;ve looked! I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
    <li> I WAITED TO REVIEW THIS ITEM, IWANTEDTO USE IT A WHILE 1ST)  ITS NICE AND MOIST. I USE IT SEVERAL TIMES a day.IT DOES SHOW AN IMPROVEMENT IN HIDING LINES ON MY FOREHEAD. I AM 70 YEARS OLD AND I DEFFIDENTLY RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Timeless, Skin, Collagen, Elastin... are all words that sound like a good face lotion, (maybe for others), but not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t fond of the scent or greasy feel.  I tend to have oily skin and avoid lotion, but after years of being in the sun and surfing without sunblock, I thought it was time to start taking care of my face.  This product unfortunately wasn&#x27;t my solution.  Although it may have some great properties for healthy skin, it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading all the great reviews. After the first night of use I woke to very radiant looking skin. Yesterday, my boyfriend even complimented how smooth my skin looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin and was worried it would create an issue with my skin, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any problems using this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this product will get rid of wrinkles, but I will continue to buy it regardless. The minimal cost for a HUGE tub and the radiance it gives my skin is defiantly worth it.</li>
    <li> this product works amazingly! i have always had very dry skin....since i tried this moisturizer my skin looks and feels so good.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping that it will help in fine lines but no, and it cause my face to break out. Just applying it on my thighs now cause some comments say that it helps in cellulite. It smells nice.</li>
    <li> I think this is my first negative review here on Amazon, something I really don&#x27;t like to do.  However, I have to speak up about this moisturizer.  The fragrance is very strong and very unpleasant (to me).  It smells like a very cheap rose perfume.  This is especially pronounced, because I don&#x27;t think my nose is as sensitive as most people&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry about the negativity in this review.  Like I said, I don&#x27;t like to write bad reviews, but perhaps people should be warned that this might not be aromatically offensive.  So, before you buy this cream, maybe pop by your local drugstore to smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> There is very little moisture in this moisturizer. I would not recommend this stuff to anyone. My face was just as dry after using this moisturizer as it was before I used it. Will never buy again. I really got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It smells light and fresh, it dries evenly into the skin, and I use it every day on my face, neck, chest and hands. I started using because Dr. Oz recommended it, and I will continue to use it forever! Great amount of cream for the price too, I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this, its light and lasts for a long time. I purchased this based on all the previous reviews. I really like to add it to my foundation as a tinted moisturizer.</li>
    <li> its ok product for the price.  definately not the best face cream I have had.  it is a normal lotion for the skin.  Not super hydrating but does the trick.  I use olay regenerist which is a MUCH better product, but for the money this is a nice cheap moisturizer to keep on hand.</li>
    <li> Yes! help to smooth your face. I love it. I put the cream inside the fridge to keep it fresh and cold.!</li>
    <li> I generally don&#x27;t use much lotion, and I find that most of it is too greasy.  This lotion is light and doesn&#x27;t leave my face or hands too slippery and shiny.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several months now and I do feel it is a bit heavy and oily  for someone who has combination skin. I also do not see much of a difference in how taught my skin looks. However I love the way it smells and it does make my skin feel very soft but I do not believe it is ideal for my skin type.</li>
    <li> When skin care products are inexpensive, one tends to think that the performance will be equal to the price. Not so with this wonderful cream. I love this moisturizer. I am woman of a certain age and I find this to be moisturizing without being greasy.  I have combination skin and it works great for me. I was quite pleasantly surprised to see how much product I received for so little money. I definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> It moisturizes very well and the amount that you get for the price is phenomenal! I love St Ives. Great brand that makes quality products!</li>
    <li> Great for the skin- great price as well Will buy again recommend it even at a higher price worth it</li>
    <li> I only gave this 3 stars as I was led to believe by the marketing that this was an emollient moisturizer but found that not to be true. I was looking for a product that would really moisturizer without a heavy feel. This is definitely a light weight cream but I do not think it moisturizes very well.</li>
    <li> I like the feel of this cream, but have not used it long enough to know if it hides wrinkles - as it claims.  I do not like the odor of it at all.</li>
    <li> We use this after we mask since masking dries out our skin. Its lovely, creamy and smooth. and even though the container is large a very little goes a long way on just your face and neck!</li>
    <li> I had unrealistic hopes for this based on the reviews. Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s really good about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It is very, very cheap&lt;br /&gt;- It is very, very huge and can last forever&lt;br /&gt;- It is a lotion for your face that is better than no lotion for your face&lt;br /&gt;- I didn&#x27;t break out when I started using it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what isn&#x27;t so good about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It is thin (its consistency) and not very \\&quot;creamy\\&quot; (but I guess you might like that if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for)&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s mediocre&lt;br /&gt;- It is basically just...lotion. Nothing special. It&#x27;s for your face. That&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not see any results, really, only that sadly the redness that went away with my other, reaaaaaaaallllly expensive lotion (Clinique redness) came right back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I guess it was too good to be true to think I could replace that with this...but maybe it&#x27;s possible to alternate this with another, more expensive lotion, to save money (one at night, the other in the morning?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have no particular or interesting skin needs and just want some very basic lotion that pretty much does some very basic moisturizing and you want to do it on the cheap, this would work.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great - I actually use on my neck/chest and sometimes face.I actually have specific products for my face - but I do use ths on my neck, hands, that delicate skin my chest. It smells lovely, great texture. I am addicted to St. Ives products though - all natural, can&#x27;t go wrong with that!</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer.  Great for neck and chest area also. Non-greasy, easily absorbed, no fragrance smell. Love it. Will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Great moisterizer and it is a super large jar. Works too !!! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> The moisturizer seems okay, as a good light water based day cream to use daily and  under foundations.  The price is right and the tub is a generous 10oz.  I would not classify it as an &#x27;intense moisturizer&#x27; but it certainly does add valuable moisture to the skin.  I would purchase this product again.  My only problem with this purchase is the labels on the tub all peeled  off long before the product was finished.</li>
    <li> This product is so thin that it&#x27;s not effective as a moisturizer. I guess it&#x27;s why so cheap.  I feel so sorry that this product starts to test on animals.  I will not buy it anymore.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t care for the smell of this, nor did I notice any improvement of skin. Going back to my old stand moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This facial cream caused  my face to break out in acne. I also get a greasy complexion every I use this product.  A waste..</li>
    <li> too greasy with  lingering odor that stays too long when you put it on your skin  also package arrived with no protective seal nor a box  throwing it away  too much trouble to return</li>
    <li> I am hoping that the collagen in this product will help with facial wrinkles.  So far, my face seems a bit smoother.  I have only been using it a few weeks, which is why only four stars.  I have no complaints.  The smell is muted and pleasant.  The product goes on easily and requires a very small amount.  My skin absorbs it nicely and my face seems smoother.  I have sensitive skin, but have not had any negative reaction.  I would recommend this for a night and day moisturizer.</li>
    <li> We received what we expected with this purchase. Appreciate the detailed description. There is nothing unusual to report.  Would buy again if needed.</li>
    <li> SO thick and rich. I use this as a body cream in the winter and I love it! A little too greasy for my face though.</li>
    <li> Great product and price. A little goes a long way, so I know this one container will last me awhile.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of it! It looks like big-bottle, but I you place on your body... you can only use them for no more than 5 times.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and have tried many facial moisturizers.  I really like this one.  The smell is nice, the price is much lower than most I&#x27;ve tried, and it really leaves my skin feeling soft.  I use it every morning after I wash my face.  The jar is big so it will last me a long time.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Large quantity for cheap and it smells awesome!!!</li>
    <li> Settles in the skin very very well.</li>
    <li> I switched from a pricey department store brand to this and haven&#x27;t looked back. Feels great on my skin as a night cream. No breakouts. Nice and creamy feeling. And it will last forever!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is great. It&#x27;s light and leaves me feeling dewy. It does not have a strong scent, and you get a lot of it for your money. I have been using it for a couple of months and feel like my skin is moist and firm, despite it being the middle of winter. Honestly, I use it all over even though it&#x27;s a facial moisturizer. You can&#x27;t beat the price, either! I don&#x27;t regret giving this a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other moisturizers including expensive ones from higher end stores and this one beats them by far. It feels light on the skin, it&#x27;s not greasy or heavy. And my sensitive acne-prone skin doesn&#x27;t break out after using this which is a miracle in itself. My face has never been so soft!</li>
    <li> This is a good collagen elastin that doesn&#x27;t cost a lot.  It makes the skin feel so good and it gives it a little shine.&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed using it.</li>
    <li> My usual facial moisturizer wasn&#x27;t cutting it when the colder drier air came this year.  This moisturizer does the trick, my face did not feel dry after washing it and still felt moisturized at the end of the day.  It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy though.  It will easily last me until the spring. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of this product so a review is well overdue and well deserved. It&#x27;s light and the fragrance is also light. This makes my skin feel creamy and I can always immediately see the difference this moisturizer makes to my skin.</li>
    <li> For the price this is a good product. I have seen quite a change in my skin and tone... collagen, collagen, collagen!  And thank you St. Ives for not testing on animals!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this item in hopes for a new facial moisturizer. I have combination skin and suffer from acne on my T-zone while my cheeks tend to get dry (especially during the winter!).&lt;br /&gt;Other moisturizers would make my face look too oily, or doesn&#x27;t give enough moisture for my dry cheeks but this one is extremely different!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this moisturizer for a week now, really makes a difference on my skin! It&#x27;s super light, with a slight clean scent, and doesn&#x27;t make my face look oily after hours of applying it with my makeup and has enough moisture to keep my face feeling soft &amp; smooth! It&#x27;s definitely an moisturizer I&#x27;m willing to use long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The service was quick and well packaged! The jar was also bigger than I expected it to be which is a great!! More for your money :)</li>
    <li> After reading a review of this product on Pinterest, I decided to give it a try. I have tried several expensive beauty creams and although they did wonders to my face, they certainly hurt my bank account. This product is large for a facial beauty cream. I smother lots of it on my face each night, smell is pleasant and not overwhelming, my skin is left feeling refreshed and smooth. My skin looks great in the morning and seems to glow a bit. Very dewey and soft. Definitely worth the purchase!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for almost a year and find that it is very good for helping keep my complexion soft and  clear, while not being greasy.  This moisturizer can be used a couple of times a day, if needed, and is obsorbed by the skin.  I am over 70 and use it without makeup most days unless I am going somewhere special.  I would recommend it for most anyone who is looking for a non-greasy type of moisturizer to help keep their complexion young looking as people often tell me they don&#x27;t believe my age and would guess closer to 55.</li>
    <li> This product was reasonable and I use it for my foot.  I really like it for what I bought it for.......feet</li>
    <li> this is the lightweight moisturizer you&#x27;ve been looking for. no spf. no serums or special formulas. just silky smooth moisture for your face and neck, at a very good price.</li>
    <li> Absorbed this cream just painted go well, but can not be sustained for a face to feel a bit dry</li>
    <li> Wow...so much moisturizer in this jar.  I use it not only on my face, but my hands.  I&#x27;m 58 and I heard somewheres that I am at the age where it is ok to use my face cream on my hands.  Really lasting a long time.  Drys nicely too.  What a price steal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, I am, or should I say WAS, and avid user of Dr Lewinns products. I simply thought there was nothing else out there that could come close to it...even though it was getting pricey, I stuck to that range of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have been introduced to the St.Ives range of products, I am hooked. With my sensitive skin, the Dr Lewinns was leaving my face with a reddish hue that lasted an hour or so till it calmed down. The St. Ives moisturizer is so gentle, and leaves me with a fresh look that is more natural. Not that heavy, greasy look.&lt;br /&gt;I am using it in conjunction with the Apricot scrub and am really loving it so far. [[ASIN:B009DW5CVS Female, Forty and Fat...What Now?

    <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a great moisturizer, and now that my skin is looking a little older, I wanted to try a moisturizer that will help improve the overall tone and texture of my skin. Unfortunately, this product didn&#x27;t do any of that. It&#x27;s not a bad product-- it feels good going on, has a nice light fragrance, and makes my skin feel as hydrated as any other moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried, but it&#x27;s nothing special, and hasn&#x27;t improved the look of my skin at all. My search continues!</li>
    <li> Im horrible at skin care.  I seen this was reccomended my Dr. Oz so I wanted it.  When I saw the price I was sold.  It feels great on my skin.  I do have rather nice skin, and still in my 2o&#x27;s, so this for me is being used a a protection.</li>
    <li> This is a great price but I wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;wowed&amp;#34; by the product.  I will continue to use it, but I am undecided if I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and I love it. It is a great moisturizer for night time and day. It does not give me any breakouts. I will keep on repurchasing.</li>
    <li> This item has not arrived YET! If it does get here it may be too late because I am growing older by the minute worrying about it! :-)</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my dry hands after reading a review where a person indicated that the hand she used to apply the lotion to her face with became soft. I have very dry hands all year long. I work in a school cafeteria and use lots of anti bacterial products causing my hands to become dry, cracked and scratchy! I use this cream maybe once or twice a day and my hands are the softest they have ever been. I have not had any cracks on my fingertips, no scrathy skin, and my nails even look healthier! I would recommend anyone with dry hands- go ahead and try this product. Every person has different body chemistry, but for the price it is worth a try!</li>
    <li> This is a good moisturiser</li>
    <li> I really like how my face feels and the smell of the lotion is yummy.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting much, but to my surprise, this is good stuff. I have very sensitive skin and this did not burn my skin or eyes! Which is a miracle! You can&#x27;t beat this, especially for the price! Very moisturizing-but not excessive or oily feeling. It absorbs right away to!</li>
    <li> I use it everyday and it doesn&#x27;t make my face break out like other products and it doesn&#x27;t leave it oily and gross feeling afterwords</li>
    <li> I love this product! feels wonderful, doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes like some do, my skin feels soft but not greasy &amp; makeup does on better too.</li>
    <li> I like the smell but I wish it was more hydrating.. you need another moisturizer or a serum to back it up.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted it because I learned Dr. Oz liked it ( not that I believe everyting Dr. Oz says or that I take his word as law ).&lt;br /&gt;but its a good price for the size of the container.</li>
    <li> so unbelievably good--i can&#x27;t believe I have gone 30 years without this. i will be a lifelong user!</li>
    <li> My skin is supple and smooth, no break outs to speak of. I would absolutely recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> I use this moisturizer over a more expensive one that contains retinol and is for sensitive/ eczema skin. I love it because I can slather it on my face and neck at night and it sinks right in. I have dry skin and I find it neither too light or too heavy. I think this is a great product for the price. It have a very light scent. I was a little worried about the mineral oil in it but turns out it was nothing to be concerned about.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it were just a little bit thicker/creamier but thats just me.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for almost a month now and it is great. keeps my skin soft and hydrated. Coming from a polluted and hot country like Egypt it really helped my skin.</li>
    <li> Made my face feel very soft an clean.. Not to oily. I only use at night and it works... Great buy</li>
    <li> After I remove my makeup I use this cream as a night time moisturizer. It does a great job of keeping my skin soft and supple, so this has become a staple product in my skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> This is the first time with this product and I&#x27;m pleased, I don&#x27;t think I realized how big a 10 oz. jar would be. Makes me wonder if I&#x27;ll ever use it all up...... if I only use it as a facial moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I would prefer it if it were a little less moist, I like a thicker moisturizer, but this feels good, I like the scent and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> After wearing everyday morning and night for a couple weeks, I&#x27;m still not getting that \\&quot;silky\\&quot; feeling that everyone else has commented.  Rather this moisturizer kind of just sits on my skin rather than \\&quot;sinking in,\\&quot; it also feels *almost* like there&#x27;s a very smooth, light rubber coating to my skin (which sounds weird, but I mean that in the best possible way...must be the elastin?).    I will say it&#x27;s the first moisturizer I&#x27;ve used that didn&#x27;t leave my skin 1) with small blemishes after a few days, and 2) oily like sunscreen.    Also the stuff goes a long way; I can lightly dot each cheek with the stuff, and it&#x27;s good to smear all over.  Considering this is a huge tub, I&#x27;m probably set for the year...    Just wish it left my skin...silkier?  Everyone else had me looking forward to super silky skin...</li>
    <li> Like many other reviewers, I had read that this was a great facial moisturizer to replace pricier products. My skin is \\&quot;normal,\\&quot; as in, it&#x27;s not too sensitive, not too dry, not too oily, just... normal. In the cooler months, my skin tends to dry out a bit, so I look for a heavier moisturizer at night. I&#x27;m in my late 20s and have always taken care of my skin, so I&#x27;m mostly looking for moisture without grease, and to take care of the faintest of fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this is horrible on my face. It goes on greasy, which, fine, I&#x27;ll wear it as a night cream. However, it completely dried out the skin around my nose, under my eyes, and most of my cheeks. I hadn&#x27;t changed anything else about my skin routine, so I know it was this, and it happened on the first night. I used it for four more days and nights in the hopes that my skin would get used to it. Nope! My skin is still dry and flaky in those areas. I started using a different moisturizer and my skin is now much smoother and softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer mentioned that this cream was great for her stretch marks. I&#x27;m six months post-partum and have awful stretch marks on my stomach; after just five days, my skin there is so much smoother and the marks have obviously lightened. If you&#x27;re looking for something to lighten your stretch marks and soften that skin, try this.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this based on all the reviews but it doesn&#x27;t seem like anything special.  It&#x27;s pretty heavy and greasy. The only really good thing I have to say about it is that it absorbs quickly. Otherwise nothing special.</li>
    <li> I love it I still have it it been like more than 2 month big jar this cream is great</li>
    <li> I wish I had found this moisturizer long ago.  It makes my very dry, aged facial skin feel very good.  It absorbs easily and works better than more expensive creams.  It is worth every penny.  My skin is super sensitive and this product does not cause breakouts at all!  I am very impressed and am so glad I found it.  I definitely recommend this St. Ives moisturizer, especially for use during the winter months.  The jar is fairly big and it should last a long time.</li>
    <li> The jar was loosely closed and the product has no safety seal -- I tossed it and won&#x27;t bother to buy another.</li>
    <li> I just started using this as I&#x27;ve run out of my favorite Aveeno lotion so I figure I better use this up so I&#x27;m not wasting my money.  So far, so good.  Very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday. My skin has soon some great improvement.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for a few years now and I love it. It is light yet effective. The lotion has helped to keep my skin looking youthful. The moisturizing properties work amazing and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Worth a try for anyone looking for a good affordable facial lotion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin. Although it&#x27;s not a major difference I like it. It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily so that&#x27;s a plus</li>
    <li> excellent moisturizer.  I use this on top of regular anti- wrinkle cream for extra moisturizing and on body after bathing.  I am on medication that dries out my skin and this cream works better than all of the other brands i have tried.</li>
    <li> My first review here on Amazon....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years I had been searching for a good lotion for my face that didn&#x27;t leave it oily or make it break out. In the past, I used lotions that, halfway through the day, would leave a sheen to my face that I would have to rinse off in the bathroom at work. I&#x27;ve used high-end lotions, too...Lab Series, Jack Black, etc....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always thought of St. Ives as some cheap drugstore brand, but I read the reviews and gave it a shot. I&#x27;ve been using it for the last 2 months now and I can honestly say it&#x27;s the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used for my face. The best part is for $5 you get a TUB of this stuff. It will last me through 2014, for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say much for the anti-wrinkle properties because I really don&#x27;t notice these things. BUT, it&#x27;s a great lightweight lotion and all you need is a few dabs on the face ever morning and night to maintain healthy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- 31 year-old guy who lives in Manhattan</li>
    <li> love this moisturizer.. I&#x27;ve been taking this for years!! does my skin wonders!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will be ordering more soon..</li>
    <li> I have Oily Skin so finding the right moisturizer is a pain. I discovered this a year back and it has now become one of my essential moisturizers .Its a  great go-to moisturizer that you will use time and time again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is light and absorbs rapidly into my skin leaving it moisturized without feeling oily. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, so less pimples. It has a nice light fragrance. And Hello the Price! So so cheap! You can&#x27;t beat that. I seriously love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Good use for a night cream as it moisturises my face over the night. I sleep in air conditioning and the air might get pretty dry at times. So this is a good use. Overall, serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd time I have ordered this night cream. I am in my early 20&#x27;s and was just looking for something to help keep my face moisturized. I love this cream because it is light and the smell is very very very light. (which is important if you are going to use it every night). It is also a very reasonable price and lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  Full disclosure, it only got 4/5 stars because it&#x27;s NOW made by Unilever.  Unilever tests on animals and is responsible for those incredibly sexist Axe body spray commercials.  Gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the lotion.  It left my skin feeling very silky and smooth to the touch.  It didn&#x27;t break my face out.  It has a very pleasant smell that was not overpowering even to my very sensitive nose.  For me, this is a better summertime lotion than wintertime, as my skin gets very dry.  This lotion is light and non-greasy and works well under makeup.  In the winter I use Ponds lotion, which is much heavier.  This lotion is incredibly inexpensive and comes in a HUGE container.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Has lasted a very long time, smells good, and absorbs well. Will buy it again - great price!</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely wonderful moisturizer for skin and I&#x27;ve used it for years.  A smaller amount will work well, but judge what you need for your skin with use.  Works well for those beginning lines from smiles and all the face movemnts one makes when talking and such. I am almost out, will be ordering more really soon.</li>
    <li> Male Reviewer: This is not some magical product, but for the price you get a large tub of lotion that will last you quite a long time. It took me over 6 months to get through one tub, and I usually use the tub morning and night. Definitely does the job, but it as for all that wrinkles and fine lines nonsense I do not notice any difference. My skin feels smoother in the morning after I put it on. Would recommend it for daily use as it is quite inexpensive and does the job well!</li>
    <li> I am not sure why all these good reviews. I mean, it is probably the cheapest on the market, but to my skin, didn&#x27;t really do what I was expecting. I used Yes to carrots for a while and I loved it, this product costed 1/5 the price, but does 1/5 of the effect. I actually don&#x27;t recommend it, probably better spending a bit more on money on something better.</li>
    <li> A lovely weight of moisturizer that I can use AM or PM - both!  It has definitely improved the overall appearance of my face and neck, and despite my skin&#x27;s tendency (even in maturity) to break out in pimples, this has not caused ANY break-out at all.  It is lasting a long time, but as soon as I run low, I will be coming back to order more!</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical because of the price. It is a good cream. Now the price makes it even better.</li>
    <li> I dont have any complaints but its not something that has made a difference. Good for moisturizer but not wrinkles or anything more.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a thin smooth facial cream this is it. My skin is a little on the dry side, so it was too thin for me. Maybe in the summer I will be able to use it more, if I don&#x27;t end up sweating it off as it makes my face sweat a little more. Seems a little pore clogging to me. Using it during the summer would require to add a sunscreen as it does not contain sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my skin personally, but it also didn&#x27;t irritate it in any way either.  I went back to my Good n Natural retinol cream.</li>
    <li> I adore this stuff. It smells good and the texture is not too heavy,not to runny.&lt;br /&gt;I really really think useing this product on my face,neck and hands is one big reason I dont look my age,at all ! This product is always overstocked in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> Have you ever not been able to part with something you love because you use it every morning and every night? This facial moisturizer is one of those holy grail products that you definitely should have in stock. There are certain things that I look for in a facial moisturizer: (1) how well it moisturizes your face, (2) how light-feeling it is, and (3) the smell. These moisturizer passes in flying colors in all of these categories. Your skin feels more plump and supple right after using it and when you use it before bed and wake up, your skin is perfection and looks so much more radiant. And I love the fact that it isn&#x27;t heavy on your face at all and absorbs almost instantly into your skin. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and doesn&#x27;t break me out at all - which I am so thankful for because I break out so easily. Lastly, I just really love the smell. It has a light lemony smell - which doesn&#x27;t linger - but it really just picks you up and wakes you up for the day ahead. All of these factors combined makes this product one of my favorite things to put on my face and it just makes my face feel so fresh and lightens my mood.. aaah &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> I use this every day. It&#x27;s so mild and light-weight and feels great after washing my face. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s effect as far as aging and elasticity yet as I&#x27;m only 26, but they say to start early!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using St. Ives products for awhile as their lotions seem to be the only ones that a.) keep me moisturized and b.) don&#x27;t make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is no exception to those rules - I like the lightweight feel of the lotion on my face. It absorbs really quickly and leaves no greasiness behind, but my skin still feels dewy and moisturized. It has a pleasant scent as well - very light (and it doesn&#x27;t stick around), unlike a few other &amp;#34;lightweight&amp;#34; moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried that smell terrible. I do feel strongly that it&#x27;s made my skin smoother - I&#x27;ve been using it a month and the dryness in my T-zone and the oiliness everywhere else seem to have gone away, which is AMAZING as I&#x27;ve never used a moisturizer that has done that (and I&#x27;m pretty terrible at exfoliating regularly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the collagen, I haven&#x27;t noticed a dramatic change except for around my eyes. I have a few small lines under my eyes and this seems to have made them much less noticeable. I can&#x27;t speak if it would erase many wrinkles as I&#x27;m only 30, but it seems to have worked pretty well for me. Plus: can you beat the price on this??</li>
    <li> I first bought it from Amazon just because it is cheap.  However, after finishing the first jar, the condition of my face improved.  The effect is even better than my Olay facial moisturizer.  Unbelievable.  Maybe just suitable for my facial condition</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT FOR SAGGING SKIN AFTER ANY FORM OF WEIGHT LOSS. VERY AFFORDABLE AND BEST OF ALL....IT WORKS. A MUST FOR MOISTURIZING</li>
    <li> Alright, so considering all the wonderful reviews this product has, and the price, I thought it was too good to be true. However, at the price, who could say no? Not me, definitely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was awesome, I must say. It arrived within two days, with standard shipping. I was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;First impressions of the product: It&#x27;s quite thick, when applied to hands it absorbs very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Now, my skin somehow manages to be simultaniously ver dry, and oily enough to be shiny if I don&#x27;t do anything about it. I&#x27;m also still young enough to have hormonal acne, so I need to choose my products very carefully. My first night using this moisturizer, I put on my usual amount, by dipping clean fingers into the jar then smoothing it over my face. I found that while it absorbed very quickly, after about ten minutes the previously matte look it left on my face turned oily--and glistening. I decided to try it anyway, and when I woke up in the morning I was totally broken out. I then decided to try using less, and found that when only applying a very small amount, it worked perfectly. However, the small amount wasn&#x27;t enough to keep my dry skin hydrated, and any more would have had me breaking out.&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT TO NOTE:&lt;br /&gt;Based on my own experiences, I feel this product should and will work very well for someone who DOESN&#x27;T have crazy combination skin like mine, i.e. if your skin is very dry, put on more, or oily--less. Remember that if your skin is dry in some areas but oily in others (normal combination skin) than you should apply different amounts to those areas accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;I thought this was a very good product, but was still rather disappointed that it didn&#x27;t work for me, personally. However, at the price, it can&#x27;t be beat. Unless you have skin like mine, I absolutely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have a jar of this, the St. Ives Collagen &amp; Elastin Facial Moisturizer.  I didn&#x27;t think much of it and wrote a bad review for it but today I was at my daughter&#x27;s house and she has a jar too and she really, really likes it, infact, she said after using almost the entire jar that her skin appears thicker.  I thought she&#x27;s younger than me and thats why. But, today at her house I was leaving and her almost empty jar was on the table so I opened it and put some on my hands and I nearly died!!!! Her cream is thick and smells o-k...my cream is runny and a completely different texture and the penny dropped.  She has the genuine article and I have a counterfeit cream.  I am disgusted, how low can you go ripping off people over a $5 something jar of cream. So, I believe my daughter, I think the cream appears good and I&#x27;m going to Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond to get myself some of the genuine St. Ives Collagen cream.</li>
    <li> I found the St. Ives Moisturizer a good product. There are many products out there that work just as good. The price on this was good.</li>
    <li> Ok, call me a weirdo but I never liked moisturizer. In fact I actually had a bit of a phobia of it and that slimy feeling I&#x27;d get if someone touched me with moisturizer on their hands. This winter however I got worried that my skin was getting dry for the first time in my life and that I would end up getting crows feet. I bought this A) because it was cheap &amp; B) had good reviews. I faced my fear and started using this after every shower. It didn&#x27;t feel as bad as I thought it would and within a few days I noticed my skin had a healthier glow and firmness to it. After a few weeks friends actually stopped me at a party to tell me how great my skin looked. This is all I use (honestly I can barely bring myself to use this) and the results have been fantastic. I might be weird but this moisturizer is awesome.</li>
    <li> My skin is normally very oily in the warmer months, and very dry in the winter months...I also tend to get shiny. This balances my skin out perfectly. Can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve gone this long without it!</li>
    <li> This cream has the collagen elastin in it so it really helps make your face feel moisturized but you are also helping your skin anti-age.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stop looking in the mirror at the drastic change in my face in only 3 days!  The product reads &amp;#34;visibly reduces fine lines and wrinkles&amp;#34; and it absolutely does!  The past 3 nights, before going to bed, I washed my face and then drenched it with this product.  I&#x27;ll be honest, I did not think it would have any effect on my face since I am 54 years old and have dry skin, so my lines and wrinkles are fairly deep.  I believe I look 10 years younger!  Woweee!!!  Yippeee!!!!  Take my advice....drink A LOT of water and use this product, no kidding.</li>
    <li> Not a great product. I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a month now and still no results. I still have wrinkles and it makes my face extra oily. Not worth buying again.</li>
    <li> Wore this for night lotion but often used in mornings during dryer months. Mixes well with foundation. Smells good without being overpowering.</li>
    <li> A great product. I wear it under my makeup (dry skin) and it doesn&#x27;t cause any issues. Not too thick or too thin.</li>
    <li> I have been using St. Ives face apricot scrub for about 5 years this is my first time using their face mosturizer. And I like it. It does have a greasy feel so dont use alot but it is very lightweight when you use a dab on your ring finger. The jar is huge sonyou will not run out of this for months. Its perfect for dry skin but I have combination skin and it works fine for me. I even use it under my makeup which gives me a nice summer glow.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer too  unfortunately I can not get this either.  It has been canceled.  You need to work on that</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing. I was doubtful when I saw the texture of the product (very creamy) that it would work for me since I have oily skin, but it feels a lot like a cool mask and keeps my skin from oiling up.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well. It&#x27;s a little to oily feeling for me though.</li>
    <li> I probably have to give it another week or so to see if it is really working.  Does make my skin soft</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer very much. Makes my skin very soft. I will continue to purchase this again. Received it very quickly.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom and she loves it. This one does not have a very strong scent which is good. Also its not super thick which is perfect for summer. Grabbed it on sale!</li>
    <li> Really like this stuff, inexpensive quality moisturizer</li>
    <li> This is a very reasonable price and does help the sagging thing that happens to skin at my age!  It is so inexpensive that I not only use it on my face, but also on my upper arms when I am going sleeveless on thighs when I wear shorts.  Those spots could use some collagen, too.</li>
    <li> I use it at day time, so far so good.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial moisturizer and lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it mainly as a night facial moisturizer. What I like about is it&#x27;s not greasy at all and has a very agreeable scent to it. my skin looks and feels smoother after just a couple weeks using it.</li>
    <li> Since the very first time that you put it on, it leaves a very nice feeling and you can feel it penetrating in your skin. It also includes a lot of product!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with it. Also I bought for my mom.</li>
    <li> I bought this in addition to the expensive facial cream that I use..La Roche-Posay, Effaclar. My face was so dry this winter so I used this a couple of times a day after my morning routine. It worked great..did not make my face break out like many creams do. It is light and feels very nice. I like the soft scent. I will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. It work immediately on my face. In a few days after using the cream, I notice the skin in my face was much firm and with less wrinkles. Love it.</li>
    <li> For some reason this moisturiser gave me pimples and felt a little too greasy for my skin even though i have dry skin.</li>
    <li> Clean sent, not greasy, just an amazing moisturizer.</li>
    <li> i just got this and i wear it before i put makeup on and it works!! it leaves my skin feeling sooo soft!&amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> This is the best face lotion I&#x27;ve bought.  It&#x27;s not greasy, it is making my skin look firmer and it has a nice light scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy !!</li>
    <li> I have a litte problem with dry skin; my nose ecspecially can get pretty bad. When i used this product my nose was better then usual but i still need to try a few products. The rest of my face felt fine but becareful sometimes i feel like it makes my face look shiny so to  prevent that i take a towel or something to lightly pat ur face for any shines.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was really cheap for the amount of lotion you get. I barely used any of it though and the whole bottle will be going to waste. I&#x27;m so disappointed especially with all the great reviews. After only a few days of wearing it at night my face feels like it&#x27;s progressively getting more dry and I am starting to break out, which is never an issue for me. Additionally I would not reccomend it especially if you are sensitive to fragrances. I can usually deal with the smell of lotions, but the smell of this really bugs me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this and like it.  My skin is thinning out and I need this.  I had a bad scrape on my arm and started putting this on and it healed quickly and the skin looks very good. I try to use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I love St. Ives products. I have been using the Apricot Scrub for years. I did not even know they made a moisturizer until I found it here on Amazon. It is so reasonably priced and what a good size! It sinks right into your skin and does not leave an oily residue. Makeup application is so smooth. I frequently get compliments on my skin and am asked what products I use. People think I am going to say it is something wildly expensive. Nope, it&#x27;s Saint Ives.</li>
    <li> I use almost every night, makes my skin so soft I love it so much. I only use maybe a little all over my face and it still isn&#x27;t even close to 1/3 done. It&#x27;s the best investment you can make for you skin and face.</li>
    <li> An okay product. Not compatible with my facial skin. Too greasy and my facial skin cannot absorbed it. The fragrance is too strong as well. I am thinking of applying it on my hand and body.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this products twice and my face feels nice and smooth.  The cold weather was really drying out my face and my face felt itchy. I am happy with this product and can&#x27;t wait to see the after effects that are still to come.</li>
    <li> I had been using Philosophy&#x27;s Hope in a Jar for years and I loved the way it made my skin feel.  However, it was expensive and unfortunately I was no longer able to fit the cost into my budget.  I found this St. Ives product here on Amazon and upon reading the glowing reviews, decided to give it a try - for the price, what did I have to lose?  Well,  I have been amazed on how smooth my face has been! I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference between this cream and the one I was paying 10x as much.  And this will last me months longer.  If you are on the fence about trying this, don&#x27;t hesitate - your skin will be happy :-)</li>
    <li> Not that moisturizing.... But lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I would compare using this product to using toothpaste which smells great and makes your breath feel fresh the moment you use it, but after time, it causes bad breath.  This product is supposed to be a moisturizer, but it actually dries out your skin.  I read all of the great and negative reviews on Amazon and Makeup Alley before trying this out and thought that since no more tha 15% of the negative reviews complained about the product causing dry skin, the good outweighed the bad.  Oh was I wrong.  I only used this for four days and my face became tight, dry and blotchy for the first time ever. Like the other reviews noted, my skin became so tight that it flaked up on certain areas of my face.  When I returned to my regular moisturizer (Alba Botanica), my skin returned to normal within one day!  Don&#x27;t buy this product--it&#x27;s like an addictive product--makes your skin dry so you feel you need the product more!</li>
    <li> I like St. Ives products, but I wasn&#x27;t too happy with this.  I did not like the way that it felt on my face, and my complexion did not look that good when I was using it.</li>
    <li> I think I own too many skin care products to be loyal to just one.  I did want to try this and I do like the way it feels.  However I can&#x27;t really rate it because I use other products as well.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer!  It is thick without being greasy or oily.  I put it on at least twice a day to my face and neck.  It has not made me breakout or left me shiny.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I just bought this yesterday so I&#x27;m not going to do an in-depth review...just a first impression.&lt;br /&gt;I heard about this product on Pinterest. Someone said it was a product Dr. Oz recommends so I looked into it and gave it a try. I was amazed at how inexpensive it was. I got mine from Wal-Mart and I believe it was less than $5 for 10 oz. When I got home from the store yesterday, I washed my face and applied this moisturizer with my eye cream. I was pleasantly surprised at how amazing my skin looked. Later that night, I took a shower and applied it again with my eye cream. When I woke up this morning my skin looked radiant. I don&#x27;t think the product claims to be a radiant product, but it&#x27;s a nice perk. At first I was concerned about using it as my day time moisturizer because I didn&#x27;t know if it would be too think and make my makeup slide off my face, but I decided to give it a go and see. It&#x27;s been 6 hours and my makeup still looks great. In fact, I think it looks better than usual. I haven&#x27;t had to touch up at all. Obviously after only a day&#x27;s use I haven&#x27;t seen major changes to my skin, but this morning when I woke up, my skin just looked more fresh. I am a 24 year old college student, so I don&#x27;t really have a problem with wrinkles, but because I don&#x27;t always get enough sleep, my skin can look a bit dull. So far, I am very impressed with this product and feel a little foolish for spending more on moisturizers in the past (and that don&#x27;t contain as much product) when this one is cheaper and I like it better.</li>
    <li> A M A Z I N G!  I am African American and it&#x27;s so true that this is for all skin types, light weight and does not overpower your face.  I have been looking for a great moisturizer for a long time and I was looking elsewhere for high price tags and little did I know it would be in Walmart for less than $6!  Thanks for the great reviews here that is what prompted me to buy it.</li>
    <li> I saw this product on Pinterest and that it was recommended by Dr Oz.&lt;br /&gt;I just turned 30 and the last 2 years have definitely noticed I was looking a lot more haggard. Decided since the price was so affordable compared to most wrinkle creams so why not give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Was worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;At first I didn&#x27;t see much difference, but I have now been using over a month day and night and I see a huge difference in overall appearance. Especially the fine lines around my eyes. I feel a lot better about my appearance.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking more for a moisturiser than a wrinkle cream you might not find it as affective as my face still gets dry from time to time but if you are looking for a cheap wrinkle cream that actually does something then give it a try.</li>
    <li> Good Product, Fast Delivery. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have delicate skin and I&#x27;m no whiner---but what is up with this stuff? I have been using it off and on for two weeks and it burns. Now I have red, rashy, flaky skin on both cheeks and my whole face is dried out and looks like He##. It has made me look 10 years older. I&#x27;m using the rest of the jar on a furniture refinishing project I&#x27;m working on.</li>
    <li> I have combo oily skin. I wanted to love this product but it made me break out. So I just use it on my hands at night now. Works great for that :)</li>
    <li> does the opposite of what it is supposed to do. I have oily skin and as soon as I put the lotion on I can feel tightness. it dried out my skin, I believe because its of because of the &amp;#34;cetal alcohol&amp;#34;. this cream is worthless for me, but according to other reviews tis phenomenal. I have been using this for over two weeks with nothing but more dryness</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for my dry skin. The price is also reasonable.  I it apply everyday. Thanks for adding moisture to my skin.</li>
    <li> Its cheap and it seems to get the job done. I havent noticed any negative side effects and thus far only good things.</li>
    <li> Been using for about 3 weeks now every night after washing my face and i love it my leaves my skin super soft with out leaving it oily my face is extremely sensitive when it comes to lotion and will usually sweat it out minutes after applying but has yet to reject this one! Just a small amount goes a long way so it will probably last me a long but plan on buying it again</li>
    <li> Great job will buy from again</li>
    <li> its a good moisturizer but it has too much of mineral oil and becomes oily. not sure if my skin improved</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer. I almost didn&#x27;t buy it because of the animal testing issue, but this particular product isn&#x27;t tested on animals. You get a huge amount for the cost. I use it at night before bed. I feel like my skin is softer.</li>
    <li> I have super dry skin and this product gives my skin the moisture it needs.&lt;br /&gt;A big plus is the price.</li>
    <li> Not bad, not great. It&#x27;s OK.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I used this lotion years ago when I teenage, then got sucked into purchasing more expensive face creams. Then I came across it again when I was looking for a high-quality moisturizer for my face. St. Ives Facial Moisturizer works like a dream! It smells very fresh and has a light but creamy texture. I have extremely oily skin and this doesn&#x27;t make me more oily. I slather it on at night after I wash my face and my skin looks firm and bright when I wake up.  I mix it with a bit of [[ASIN:B002J31SL6 Boots Expert Shine Control Moisture Cream 3.3 fl oz (100 ml)]] in the morning and it works great. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> If you bought this stuff because of DR Fraud-I mean DR Oz-You got a big problem. Before I researched Dr Oz I thought he was a God. Now I know he promotes products to get rich! This is the worst skin creme I have used in my entire life and I am over 65. If you look at the ingedients Collagen is the last one mentioned which means youre probably lucky if 1 half of 1 percent is collagen.Its just worthless,so dont throw your money away; dont watch Dr Fraud or buy anything he recommends. This is the TRUTH!</li>
    <li> So Dr. Oz says this is the best cream out there?  It&#x27;s not.  Maybe for the value it is, but I&#x27;ve used much nicer creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to be frugal, i decided to give it a shot after my expensive moisturizer was gone.  The first time i applied it it made my face sting!  I do have somewhat sensitive skin, and after the second or third application my face got used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: The container is HUGE and will last a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Sting factor</li>
    <li> I was in Walmart and I saw this on the shelf, after reading the reviews on Amazon. I tried it for the first time this morning, and I absolutely love it! I only needed very little on my face. The cream feels light on my fingers and like nothing when I have spread it over my face. This is a great buy at Walmart with a cost $4.67, instead of $5.99 here. With a 10oz jar, you won&#x27;t need the subscribe and save feature. I see why St. Ives is still around and I will continue to use this and their other products.</li>
    <li> I was looking high and low for flight cream to lather on my face to take advantage of the highly drying air during flights. Enter Timeless Skin Collagen. Found this creme recommended on a blog and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere (no CVS, no Target, no Walmart, no Longs, no Safeway...) so was really happy when I found this on Amazon. I used this on my first flight and surprised on how soft my skin felt after landing. It soaked in like a sponge and left my face baby-skin soft!!! I use this as my daily moisturizer now (even beating out Oil of Olay for Sensitive Skin) and I have seen the improvement of lines and wrinkles disappear on my face. My husband&#x27;s bald head got sunburned over the summer and he used some of this to help his peeling skin, he was so impressed with the soothing qualities and the moisturizing that I had to get him his own jar! Bought as a flight cream, I&#x27;m happy I bumped into this product and now has a permanent spot in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> Omg!! This stuff really works!! I almost spent 100.00 for some wrinkle cream and after researching reviews I bought St. Ives timeless skin and it works!!</li>
    <li> fillers and garbage ingredients. the worst i have seen. nothing in this product is beneficial to the skin. collagen and elastin can be forced into the skin!?!?! it is by far the worst product out there that suggests natural ingredients. go elsewhere!</li>
    <li> I had heard about this moisturizer before on Pintrest being supported by Dr. Oz for its benefits, and so I decided to look into it. My skin is combo/oily where my T-zone gets horribly oily within a few hours and my cheeks can sport dry, flaky patches, so finding a good night-time moisturizer that wouldn&#x27;t tip my skin&#x27;s delicate balance was crucial. For a while I was using Aveeno&#x27;s or Generic Aveeno night-time cream, but the expense was getting to be too much. As much as I love Aveeno, their face products can get pretty pricey. So when I heard about a St. Ive&#x27;s face cream that supposedly worked better than the more expensive brands, I was definitely intrigued. Since I&#x27;ve used St. Ives exfoliating cleansers for my skin to treat acne, I had a good feeling about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first night I tried it, my skin literally drank the cream in. I was surprise at how much it took in, like it was dehydrated. Luckily, after the first few nights, I didn&#x27;t need so much for my skin to feel adequately moisturized. Once my skin acclimated, I must say, my skin visibly looked smoother and softer, it felt honestly healthier than it had in weeks before. The dry patches disappeared, the oil problem stopped being so bad at night (although I found other ways to treat it during the day), and the skin of my neck became softer and smoother as well. This product pretty much exceeded my expectations, not only in terms of performance, but also in terms of price and amount. For less than six dollars, I got so much product that even after the last month, I&#x27;ve made only the slightest dent in the amount of product in the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one of my favorite things about this product is the scent. Yes, it does have a mild scent, but one that definitely isn&#x27;t overpowering or irritating. To me, it honestly smells like fresh cut Golden Delicious apples. It&#x27;s bizarre but true! I love the scent! It&#x27;s very mild and only noticeable when you start putting it on and rubbing it in, but the scent quickly dissipates, so no lingering smell if you don&#x27;t like it. But I love that little quirk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to others. It&#x27;s cheap for the amount, sinks into the skin so easily without any greasy residue, honestly works as my skin looks so much better after having been using it for over a month now, and the scent is delicious. Five stars all the way!quickly dissipates, so no lingering smell if you don&#x27;t like it. But I love that little quirk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to others.

    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this stuff. It absorbs better than Clinique, is FAR less expensive than Lancôme, and just smells great! Forget spending your money on expensive stuff like Obagi. I slather this on my face, neck, hands and the tops of my feet and my elbows. Use it after using a good exfoliating face brush and your skin will feel like a 2yr old&#x27;s. I hope they never stop making this!</li>
    <li> Wow. This is up there with the best.  I have been using some of the most expensive skin moisturizers from fancy Department store and was disappointed several times. St. Ives is Great. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated for hours. This should be a must have.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this moisturizer. It has a pleasant smell and feels good on the skin. Once it soaks in I can put my sunscreen right over it. No problem with either rolling off.</li>
    <li> Cost effective and leaves skin beautiful. Cleanse prior to applying for best results</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Thank you! A+</li>
    <li> I am so excited about this purchase. It is thick, cool and my skin just eats it up! My face already looks younger! Better than any expensive department store creams ( which I also have).</li>
    <li> I  ordered this for a friend, so all I know is that she loves it and I found a great price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Im an olay girl but love this non greasy formula for my face</li>
    <li> I had been completely devoted to Olay facial moisturizer, but since trying this I love it in the jar much better. It lasts forever and while I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my laugh lines, i delfinitely feel moisturized after. Will order more when I do eventually run out.</li>
    <li> This product is a tad too much on the greasyish watery side for me to apply to my face. I prefer creams that are more creamy for use on my face. This works fantastic on my neck, however, and even a little bit on my hands.  I will be looking for something else though for my face needs but will be picking this up from the store again for my other needs since the price is fantastic.</li>
    <li> Good for the price, great size. I do agree with some of the reviews about breakouts... Maybe is not ideal for oily or combination skin types.</li>
    <li> smooth, and large quantity!!!!would take a long time to consume all...</li>
    <li> It is a large jar and you get your money&#x27;s worth, I did not like the scent, but it is all right.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for 3 months(Extremely bad idea).&lt;br /&gt; At the same time i had purchased this i ordered Neutrogena Grapefuit face wash.&lt;br /&gt;Soon after i started getting rashes around my mouth area. REALLY BAD RASHES, RED AND PAINFUL.&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using the wash thinking that was causing it. But still the rashes wouldn&#x27;t go away.&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea why i wouldn&#x27;t think it was this moisturizer causing it. I guess i trusted too much.&lt;br /&gt;Please dont buy this product its very harsh  for your skin.&lt;br /&gt; I rarely go on here to review products but when i do i feel i have very good reasons to do so. Stay away from this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive moisturizer but works well</li>
    <li> I bought it because my friend had it and I thought it was pretty good after trying it out.&lt;br /&gt;Just so you know what my skin is like, I am Asian and a college student. I have been using it on and off for a month now after washing my face. I don&#x27;t notice anything particularly amazing, like suddenly having a heavenly glow of beauty, but the good thing is that I have not broken out with more acne since using the product. It doesn&#x27;t make me feel oily or my face heavier after I put it on, and it has been pretty good with keeping my face from drying out. It is warm here, so that may not be an accurate representation of its effectiveness. I like the product and I will keep using it!</li>
    <li> Pretty thin but the tub will last forever</li>
    <li> Great stuff and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell that great, but it really works wonders.  I apply the stuff whenever I remember too and I definitely notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if that is the real effect or just using a moisturizer makes me feel better, but I suppose by that point it doesn&#x27;t really matter anyway.</li>
    <li> I HAVE ONLY USED THIS CREAM FOR 3 DAYS AND FINE MY FACE IS VERY SOFT.  I PUT IT ON IN THE MORNING AND AT NIGHT.  IT&#x27;S GOOD SIZE CONTAINER AND I WOULD BUY IT AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I am VERY sensitive to smell to the point that I can&#x27;t stand lipstick smell. When I first opened the package, I thought I was smelling too much chemicals. Even so, I put this on my face to see the result. Surprisingly, it&#x27;s very moisturizing. If only this was fragrance free, I would&#x27;ve used it. This smell makes me very nauseous. I don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s sensitive to smell.</li>
    <li> I have very dry mature skin and this did not work for me at all. When you first put it on it absorbs very well but leaves your skin feeling tight and dull. Continued to use it for a week and then threw it away.</li>
    <li> Not for sensitive skin, contains fragrance.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer, leaves skin smooth feeling, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I really like the feel of this cream, and the light scent. I don&#x27;t see any discernable difference in my skin other than that it feels softer. Doesn&#x27;t seem any firmer, but I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  It is reasonably priced, non greasy and an overall great moisturizer. I highly recommend it for daily use.</li>
    <li> Its good for the face,</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this product! It is thick, creamy, but not greasy. And did I say I love it!</li>
    <li> This might work better as a night time cream, but is too greasy to use as a daytime mosturizer for combination skin.</li>
    <li> Bought this for years, when I can find it in local drug store, but was having a hard time finding it, and was pleased that Amazon has it!  It goes on smooth/silky, and collagen/elastin, going by research, is an excellent moisterizer for your face/skin!</li>
    <li> I ordered this from Amazon 9 days ago, but it hasn&#x27;t been sent out yet, so being impatient, I bought some at my local Walmart 3 days ago. Great price. It does go on nice and has left my skin with a smooth texture. I have very sensitive eyes and have no reaction when putting it on. It has made a difference in the skin on my neck and chest in just these 3 day. It&#x27;s more supple looking. My mother will enjoy having the jar of St Ives from Amazon when they finally process it.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer! Makes my skin feel really nice and not greasy, at all! Pretty much dried completely with little residue! My face was not oily in the morning, will buy again!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite moisturizer. I usually buy it at Walmart but it was less expensive on Amazon and there was a $1.00 coupon available. There&#x27;s a lot of product in the tub. It moisturizes without leaving your face feeling oily.</li>
    <li> Item was packed incredibly well and was surprized on the size I thought it would b the same as the one in the store but it was huge such an amazing deal offered by the add on program ! And not to mention that the product itself is amazing ! Totally recommend !!</li>
    <li> did not improve my skin dryness or hydrate in anyway</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product to replace some of my expensive skin creams. Bought this from all of the rave reviews but just didn&#x27;t impress me. Very liquid. I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Finally found a daily mosturizer that I enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;: : : : : : : : : : : :</li>
    <li> I have a prone acne skin, and so far this product has being really great! It keeps my skin hydrated but not oily. Haven&#x27;t used for a time long enough to see if it will actually help with aging though.</li>
    <li> I used to love St. Ives products. But, in this age of awareness and a great app called &amp;#34;Cruelty Free&amp;#34;, I&#x27;ve learned that they test on animals. So, as well as this product works, I will no longer buy it or any other product from St. Ives. If they want to go the extra mile and make things that do not involve testing on animals, I will reconsider becoming a customer again. Until that time, bye bye St. Ives.</li>
    <li> Love the way it feels on my skin and can see improvement in fine lines and a bit of formness</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any results. Even using every day my skin remains very dry. I would prefer next time to spend more money and get a better quality facil moisturizer.</li>
    <li> My favorite moisturizer of all times, i have been buying it for a few years now and nothing seems to beat it</li>
    <li> Great smell and leaves skin soft. I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in skin tone or wrinkles so far but don&#x27;t use it daily.</li>
    <li> first time I used this cream and I can safely say that I am happy and satisfied with their work. I want to try other products from this brand</li>
    <li> Wife has used this brand and size for about 4 years now and swears by it.  One jar lasts her about a year</li>
    <li> St.lves Facial Moisturizer  Timeless Skin Collagen Elastin not worked as others said. After using it, my skin is still dry as before. It can&#x27;t keep water of face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product for so many people because it works. It makes your skin feel fresh, clean and visibly assists any issues such as: uneven eyelids, laugh lines, ect. It takes a week or two for results, but considering it&#x27;s cheaper than most products - it&#x27;s worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Great product...Not sure if I see any change in my skin wrinkle wise, however, it feels good going on , it does tighten your skin, comfortably, and It adds a softness and a glow to your face.  I would recommend this St. Ives Facial moisturizer.  Great quality for a great price!</li>
    <li> I use this nightly and it&#x27;s wonderful!!! My skin feels so moisturized each time I use this! It absorbs wonderfully into skin. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I saw this moisturizer in SELF magazine and they totally recommended it. Price is awesome and it works great for older 40&#x27;s ladies!</li>
    <li> I purchased this primarily to reduce the fine lines on my 27 yr old skin, but I am disappointed that it hasn&#x27;t done that. I have been using this product daily for about two months now and I have already developed a few new fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets two stars because it smells nice and it does a decent job at moisturizing without feeling oily. Also, even though I have sensitive skin, it doesn&#x27;t cause a burning feeling nor has it caused me to breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I do not recommend this product for minimizing fine lines, but it is nice as a light moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I purchased expensive department store moisturizers for many years.  I decided to save money and try a less expensive product.  I ordered a jar of St Ives and loved it from the first day I tried it.  It is not too heavy and is not greasy or oily.  Makes my skin feel soft and moist.  Just ordered 2 more jars ........</li>
    <li> Great lotion; left my skin feeling hydrated. Did not diminish the fine lines like I wanted but I may not have used it long enough. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a &amp;#34;get by.&amp;#34; But after using it for the past 8 weeks have discovered it works as well, if not, better than my $95.00 moisturizer.  I&#x27;m going to stick with this.  It seems to have a better firming effect and I have noticed a smoother appearance to my skin tone.</li>
    <li> love this product, this cream leaves your skin moisturized and not greasy, I recommend this brand and this product, and unfortunately can not find it in my country (Venezuela)</li>
    <li> This has been my moisturizer for 5 years now. And this is my first review of it. Well, I only did this review because this is the first time that I looked at it on Amazon. I usually buy this in our nearby store. Well, I should have bought this in Amazon the whole time because it&#x27;s cheaper here. And I do not have to spend gas, effort and time in going to stores. I could just take a few clicks on the computer and then you have your product in a flash.&lt;br /&gt;Now, as with the product, St. Ives has always given me confidence in their products since I first got their hand and body lotion back when I was still in college. Until then, this brand would always be with me whenever I go for shopping for facial and beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer would help me in keeping my skin free from dryness and cracks. This has helped me keep a radiant glow even in the darkest of hours. I highly recommend this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using really expensive products for my&lt;br /&gt;sensitive skin. and surprizingly this product is&lt;br /&gt;just same as those expensive ones.&lt;br /&gt;Im gonna use this more than those.&lt;br /&gt;I love. for sensitive skin, this is really good.</li>
    <li> Light and silky. Great moisturizer for a very little money. After using it skin feels hydrated and fresh. Love it.</li>
    <li> not only it makes my skin dryer than when I don&#x27;t use any lotion, I got white flake all over my face like peeling after a nasty sunburn.  It feels like one too.  Feeling stretching, stinging, crumbling on my face.  Once you put it on, It won&#x27;t let you forget, not even a split second, that you have a faulty moisturizer on your face.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t leave your face still feeling dry or oily. The only thing I wish was done differently is putting it in a different container. I prefer the squirt containers so I don&#x27;t have to worry about bacteria being in the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; lotion. I would still recommend this though!</li>
    <li> This cream is absolutely wonderful! It leaves your skin smooth and supple, and over time, I can definately see an improvement in my fine lines! And a great value!</li>
    <li> I love all St. Ives products, but this product in particular is very good on my winter dry skin. Non greasy and absorbs fast.</li>
    <li> I looked up every where to get a good face moisturizer and many sites sited this one.  I am not a fan of this cream.  Doesn&#x27;t work as well as others stated.</li>
    <li> I like this moisturizer, it is very smooth, smells nice and it absorbs easily. It leaves my skin feeling really soft without being greasy. I wish I could give it 5 stars, but my only issue is that it comes in a plastic container, no box, no protective seal, nothing. Anybody could open and sample it and there is no way to know who had their germy fingers in it!</li>
    <li> It bothers me that the product didn&#x27;t come with any kind of seal. You twist open the jar and the product is just there, out in the open where anyone can tamper with it if they want. No seal under the cover, no plastic tape around the outside, nothing to assure you that the product is safe or authentic, or whatever. This is my first time buying this product, and I&#x27;m always worried when a product comes to me in this condition. I&#x27;m going to test it on the back of my hands first to see if anything bad happens. I hesitate to put it on my face, but we&#x27;ll see. Will update...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - Okay, so one thing I learned; this cream is not for sensitive skin. I did try it on my face. For about an hour afterwards, my skin would itch at varies areas on my face. Next morning, though, my skin felt really smooth and soft. So I guess if you have sensitive skin and can tolerate the itchiness for a bit after applying, you can enjoy this product.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product, it will not clog your pores, it is really satisfying and moisturizes nicely.  Great value for price!</li>
    <li> Got it fast and it&#x27;s alot bigger than I expected which is better:) smells pretty good:)</li>
    <li> I was scare to use this product since it&#x27;s so cheap and I always used high end moisturizer. However, this is much better than those high end products and the jar is huge. The jar was damaged little from packaging I guess but it wasn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
    <li> Moisturizesvery very well, and smells great! Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Nice and good price, good service. I will recommend to other friends to buy it and will buy it again! Thanks.</li>
    <li> I am 33 years old, with dry skin. this product breaks my skin out. i really want to love it because of it&#x27;s value and the scent is wonderful. but it doesn&#x27;t work for  &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34; skin. my mother in law is in her 60s and swims, so she claims she has dry skin but doesn&#x27;t look like it.  gave this to her and she loved it. maybe the product works well for that age group. im sure when im in my 60s ill try this product again.</li>
    <li> This cream is very soft with my skin and doesn&#x27;t stings my clothes, it refreshes my skin and makes me feel comfortable through the day.</li>
    <li> Purchased this to use on neck and decollette area and it seems to be making my skin smoother and softer.</li>
    <li> Soaks into my skin well, doesn&#x27;t irritate me even though my skin is very very sensitive. Has a really lovely texture and moisturizes my dry skin. I have no problems wearing this under makeup even though I often have problems with other face moisturizers. I used to use this only at night but now I use it day and night. Also doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes.</li>
    <li> I am over 50 and have not done much till now and it is great at moisturizing.  I have seen some of the smaller lines become almost invisible on my face and the deeper wrinkles at the brow line between eyes seem to have gotten not as noticeable to me and I am extremely critical of my wrinkles.  I wish that it absorbed a little faster but is not at all greasy which is great!  I have tried many of the so called miracle products out there and personally I found that the St. Ives Facial Moisturizer, Timeless skin collagen elastin is as good as any I have tried and for someone of a set income I can actually afford it and not go broke.  Try it is all I can say I like it and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Great cream and great price!&lt;br /&gt;Totally recomended. Hydrates to perfection.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is fabulous&lt;br /&gt;this is the second time I buy</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer, will not quit using.</li>
    <li> Love it for the price!  Have been using coconut oil at night and this for the day... But you do need sunscreen</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this item on Amazon but I will next time if my local drugstore stops stocking it. Not only is this moisturizer light and silky when applied but it keeps on working well after you have forgotten all about it. The fragrance is subtle enough that the scent-sensitive shouldn&#x27;t object to using it.  (St Ives please don&#x27;t make this fruity scented like you did with your hand cream!) All in all I find this stuff to work just as well or better than other more expensive lotions. It might exceed your expectations like it did mine.</li>
    <li> I have used the St. Ives Collagen &amp; Elastin lotion for years. While I was bummed out they changed the texture of the lotion I still love the product. I am 42 and live in MN where the winters are brutal and skin dries out terribly. I have never ever had dry skin. The lotion is pure and absorbs into my skin making it smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t realize they had a facial skin cream so I am excited to try it.&lt;br /&gt;With the crap products on the market today with parabens and proprolyn glycol that cause cancer, I am happy that St. Ives makes a pure product from plants that actually works. Keep up the great work St. Ives.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many, many years and then was unable to find it when I moved from NJ to MA. I was so happy when I spotted it on line. I am 76 years old and still get compliments for my skin. I owe it to the use of St. Ives, Timeless Skin Collagen Elastin</li>
    <li> I love the texture it feels. But after I saw its bad ingredients and did the research on EWG, I decided to use it only for my body but not for my face. However, every time I applied it, I would have a rash either on my arm or my leg...So..now I decided to use it as my feet lotion..</li>
    <li> my skin gets very dry in the winter. I used a lots of different moisture. I found this one works great. Price is unbeatable. The smell is little to strong though.</li>
    <li> This is just ok. Comparable to most other moisturizers out there. I do have to say it is a great price.</li>
    <li> Best face cram for the money. Using it daily will keep you well hydrated. Helps with wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using St Ives Timeless Skin moisturizer for a long time and I am very happy with it. It works beautifully for my combination skin, hydrating my dry areas and yet light enough to not add shine or oil to my oily t-zone. I like that it has clean, safe ingredients too - I noticed a few reviews from people complaining about certain ingredients and spreading false info. I&#x27;ve personally researched every ingredient in this moisturizer (as I do every product I put on my skin or in my body), and I just felt I should set the record straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) Cosmetic and pharmacological grade mineral oil is completely different from industrial mineral oil (which is what many people try to scare you with). It is highly refined to allow skin to breathe while at the same time creating a protective barrier on skin, locking in moisture. It is one of the safest, most effective and most gentle moisturizers known to man. It does not cause cancer, damage your liver or age skin - all those claims are from misinformed people who confuse it with unrefined industrial mineral oil. The two are totally different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) Propylene Glycol is a humectant and delivery agent. It is very safe and used in minuscule amounts in cosmetic products. It helps bring the active ingredients in a product down deep into the skin where they can be utilized for the skin&#x27;s benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am more than a little tired of the scare tactics used by some overzealous but misinformed people about perfectly safe ingredients. People, please don&#x27;t listen to every scary person or website, but do your own research. Consider valid, medical affiliated websites with actual accountability and peer reviewed information, NOT the websites that are more like blogs by fear-mongers, or websites designed to sell their own &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products. Such websites can be biased and can leave YOU misinformed about the truth. Honestly, there are people out there that will tell you just about anything you can think ofis bad for your health. Use your own brain and do your own research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this Timeless face cream for years and I believe it has contributed to my skin staying young looking, smooth and soft. I also use a foundation with SPF everyday, even in winter. Having said that, just FYI, I am 41 years old and sometimes still get carded (not often, but hey, the fact that it happens at all at my age is really good! I&#x27;ll take it!). So ... That&#x27;s my 2 cents. Hope it helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> This is a light moisturizer. It wasn&#x27;t strong enough for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when someone told me about this because it was so inexpensive.  I started out just using it a night.  My skin feels and looks better.  I have sensitive skin and had no problem with irritation either.  Sometimes I apply it for daytime use if I am not going to be in the sun.  It has no sunscreen in it.  I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice moisturizer.  Everyone has such different reactions to smells and such that I would hate to mislead anyone.  I have read many reviews many places about this product.  Sometimes I wonder if we are talking about the same thing or are some just more picky than I am?  For me and my sisters (5) who have all used this since I got it, we think the smell is light and unobjectionable.  None of us have thought it to be greasy feeling.  We all decided years ago that the best way for us to use products like this is to apply it after our nightly bath while we watch tv just before going to bed.  This gives it time to be absorbed while you are doing practically nothing.  We almost never have any excess to wipe off.  We have a wide range of ages (50-70) and we all agree that we see positive changes in our skin and will be reordering very soon.</li>
    <li> I follow this really awesome beauty blogger who recommended this moisturizer over way more expensive brands. And she was right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt an immediate change when I started using this. I only put this on once before bed (even though the directions recommend that you use it twice daily) since it&#x27;s summer and there&#x27;s already some moisture in the air. When I wake up, my skin feels so good. My cheeks feel taut and firm and my face feels soft all over. I&#x27;m 24 years old and I avoid the sun as much as possible, so my skin isn&#x27;t too damaged, and even I feel a huge difference in when I use this and when I don&#x27;t. What&#x27;s also nice about this product is that it helps to create a more even layer for my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size of this is also crazy-huge. For just a few dollars, you get a large jar, enough to last at least a year or two (maybe more!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t have SPF. Luckily, my Bare Minerals makeup does have SPF, so that&#x27;s not a huge down for me.</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to use. Very good price. This moisturizer is very gentle on my skin. I use it both morning and night time.</li>
    <li> Light weight and soft. Can&#x27;t say it does anything super special, but it&#x27;s a good everyday facial lotion that doesn&#x27;t make skin oily</li>
    <li> Love this product. However, I found that in the tough winter months, you might need a bit more moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I used to use philosophy hope in a jar but when amazon stopped offering it thru subscribe and save, I thought it was time to try something else.  This was well rated, for a reason.  It&#x27;s mildly scented and should last me forever!</li>
    <li> Great bang for your buck.  Product smells nice and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love using this as an everyday moisturizer. It&#x27;s cheap and you get alot of product. It smells really nice and is very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great stuff, very hydrating, very cheap.  I use it at night.</li>
    <li> Works much better than many over-priced brands; feels very nice on the skin. Very good value.</li>
    <li> I dont care what anyone says, this stuff is so hydrating. My sensitive skin drinks this up!!</li>
    <li> I heard about this cream on Dr Oz and could not find it anywhere in my area. So glad it was available online. Saved me from driving all over town hunting it down. Love it.</li>
    <li> Lovely soft texture and whooper of a size container. Too soon too tell if the product will deliver results. Nice moisturiser though</li>
    <li> Excellent product!!!!!</li>
    <li> St. Ives always makes excellent products it seems. My favorites are this and the apricot scrub. I highly recommend using this a daily moisturizer after the shower. Be careful not to use too much, as it can cause breakouts like any moisturizer.</li>
    <li> St. Ives does a much better job on my skin than the product I was using for a fraction of the cost. Lasts all day, yet feels very light on skin and not greasy at all. Love it!</li>
    <li> Light, not oily and leaves my skin feeling smooth and moisturized. Soothing scent and not even a bit of residue, my skin looks radiant and smooth after I apply make-up. Even my husband loves it!</li>
    <li> My skin loves this moisturizer and just takes it in leaving my skin looking hydrated and healthy...I would recommend this product because it works.</li>
    <li> When I had acne and extremely oily skin this moisturizer made my face feel slimy and more oily. Since using a Olay Pro-x in addition my skin is clearer and the moisturizer works perfectly. It leave my skin soft, supple, and moist. Definitely not for oily skin or those with acne!</li>
    <li> works well ,feels creamy and rich and not greasy at all.  I put it on at bedtime.  I like St Ives in general.</li>
    <li> Seriously love this stuff! Its a great moisturizer, day or night. It&#x27;s a hugee bang for your buck! You get a big tub for such a small price. I really like St. Ives products and this just validates it once again for me</li>
    <li> I use this at night before I go to bed.  My face feels so soft in the morning.  Will continue to use long term.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the quality ingredients in this cream at this price.  I&#x27;m used to paying much more for anything with collagen.  This one is so reasonably priced and so creamy, I can use as much of it as I want. I&#x27;ll definitely be re-ordering.</li>
    <li> Really pleased with this product. I use it morning and night because I love how it makes my skin feel. I bought it April 2015, so after the St. Ives buy out and possible formula changes. FYI- I am in my mid 20s so I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles or skin damage. I use this more as a preventative method and during the day I wear a BB cream with sunscreen over it. But for some reason in addition to evening/brightening skin tone, this product has also helped with my acne. Not sure why as it is not intended for that purpose. Maybe my old moisturizer (Aveeno daily by the way) was breaking me out or maybe before my skin was dry causing my face to overproduce oil. I don&#x27;t know and don&#x27;t care too much. Just soooo happy I have found something that works! :)</li>
    <li> My skin is sensitive and this works great with my skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks and feels great. My 9 year old daughter is using aswell in the AM before heading to school. Her skin is extremely dry to the point where no moisturizer was working. Now her skin is radiant and so is my skin. Don&#x27;t waste your money or time on expensive creams. This is it!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer. I use it every night after I wash my face and my skin still feels hydrated in the morning. And since it is not too heavy I use it on my chest as well without worrying about clogging my pores. Love this stuff and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> At this price I love to slather this on a cleaned face at night.  My almost 50 yr skin just loves soaks this up.  Causes no breakouts or blemishes and skin feels super smooth in the morning.</li>
    <li> When I used the product it made my face too oily. It caused breakouts which I was trying to avoid by properly moisturizing after cleansing my face.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t feel any moisture had been added to my skin, very misleading. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I had unrealistic hopes for this based on the reviews. Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s really good about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It is very, very cheap&lt;br /&gt;- It is very, very huge and can last forever&lt;br /&gt;- It is a lotion for your face that is better than no lotion for your face&lt;br /&gt;- I didn&#x27;t break out when I started using it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what isn&#x27;t so good about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It is thin (its consistency) and not very \\&quot;creamy\\&quot; (but I guess you might like that if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for)&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s mediocre&lt;br /&gt;- It is basically just...lotion. Nothing special. It&#x27;s for your face. That&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not see any results, really, only that sadly the redness that went away with my other, reaaaaaaaallllly expensive lotion (Clinique redness) came right back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I guess it was too good to be true to think I could replace that with this...but maybe it&#x27;s possible to alternate this with another, more expensive lotion, to save money (one at night, the other in the morning?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have no particular or interesting skin needs and just want some very basic lotion that pretty much does some very basic moisturizing and you want to do it on the cheap, this would work.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t make me break out, it actually improved the appearance of my skin. It smells and feels great going on!</li>
    <li> I am a die hard Mary Kay girl, but the moisturizer I used was discontinued by the company.  I have been looking for a moisturizer that does what Mary Kay did for me.  My skin feels soft and smooth; hydrated.  There is no greasy film on my face or extra shine.  I am very happy with the product.  The added bonus:  it doesn&#x27;t break me out!</li>
    <li> I saw little improvement, I like that the item is not small and has a lot of facial moisturizer to last for a few months.</li>
    <li> At less than $5 a jar, St. Ives Facial Moisturizer, Timeless Skin Collagen Elastin is quite a bargain.  Using it occassionally on my face, nearly daily on my feet and after a month or so I have not hit the bottom of the jar yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned that the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; fragrance is very strong when you initially open the container.  I&#x27;ve noticed that the scent has faded (my smell sensitive daughter told me it &amp;#34;doesn&#x27;t stink so bad&amp;#34; now) as the weeks have passed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint is that the cream is so slick that it slides off my fingers before I can get it on my skin.  Surprisingly, it does not leave an oily residue, the scent quickly fades and even with my sensitive skin and mixing this with magnesium chloride oil does not break out my face, nor anywhere else I put it (feet!  this plus mag oil has my feet looking and feeling a couple decades younger!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decent product, great price, will probably reorder it as it works great on my feet and hands.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin so soft and smooth.  Also, it works great on really dry skin.  It didn&#x27;t break me out which is a major plus since I have acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> This cream smells amazing. I realize that&#x27;s probably not what&#x27;s important here, but I thought I would mention it because I can&#x27;t stop smelling it every time I open it. Now to the point - it&#x27;s a nice cream that does a great job at moisturizing. I was previously spending about $25 for a bottle that was about a fifth the size of this, so the price makes this a much more impressive product. I have tried many other creams in this price range and they tend to be runny and ineffective. For the price, this cream knocks it out of the park.</li>
    <li> I LIKE ST. IVES PRODUCTS. EVERYONE SAYS I LOOK YOUNGER THAN 77 YEARS SO I GUESS IT HELPS.</li>
    <li> Best facial moisturizer!  This works just as well, if not better than the more expensive creams with big brand names</li>
    <li> This product is very good. Not greasy like some. I couldnt find it in the store so I tried online and found it!!! I have been using this product for about 5 years now!! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I really cannot say enough about this stuff... After just one use, my face was, I kid you not, baby soft! I am so in love with this face cream. I use it at night, and in the morning before makeup application. Normally, I would never use a lotion before makeup application (I have a moisturizing BB cream for that) but this stuff absorbs well and adds a good defense to the &amp;#34;smile lines&amp;#34; that show up after a days worth of my makeup. I am 24 y/o, caucasian, with fair skin, and I cannot say much about longterm wrinkle prevention, but I will be using this product forever and ever! I can feel a healthy, supple difference in my face that I have felt with no other face lotion. Highly highly recommend for any face type!</li>
    <li> I use this at night before I go to bed. It is kind of greasy, and it has some questionable ingredients in it, but overall, not bad. This cream will probably last me forever because I only use a fingertip or two for all over my face. I don&#x27;t know if the collagen really works, I still seem to be developing wrinkles under my eyeballs.</li>
    <li> This had great reviews, but I don&#x27;t like it.  Smell&#x27;s, has a thin texture, and didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference on my skin.  Would not recommend it to any of my friends!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer was recommended by Dr Oz, so I bought it to give it a try. I like the softness and creamlike feeling. It glides on the skin. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> As many other women I also have spents lots of money on facial products. By far this is the only product I love everything about it. I kinda have light circles under my eyes (ALLERGIRES). But my main concern was the bone area right under the eyes that are kn of saggy due to smoking and I sleep on the side of my face. After using this profuce with vitamin e there is a huge different in 4 days. IThe container is very large and only takes a samll amount. My face feels so soft, im sure vitamin e helps also. I have finally found my holy grail. I use in morning and evening , i use St.Ives first let it soak in then apply vitamin e.  I highly recommed this product.</li>
    <li> Lots of good lotion for the price I bought two and I think I will never have to buy lotion again</li>
    <li> I have used St. Ives in the past but had trouble finding it locally. So when I found it on Amazon I was thrilled. I love this. I use it everyday and have already noticed the difference. I bought 2 jars so I will have one at camp this summer. It is the best moisturizer for me.</li>
    <li> Have been using this cream nightly since I received it but haven&#x27;t noticed any change for the better or worse.  Smells good though and has a nice texture, but think I will buy another product next time.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I have used this product for a long time and it works for me.  Because I am allergic to so many skin products, I was happy to find one I could use.</li>
    <li> Dr. Oz&#x27;s product for affordable a collagen product.  Great moisturizer for bed time not sticky.  Smooth and works on the body as well.</li>
    <li> Male reviewer here. I don&#x27;t like lotions or creams of any because of the way it makes me feel greasy and slick. However, in the winter time when my face gets real dry I really need something worth a darn to keep my face from look and feeling like crap. This stuff is just awesome, and you only need a tiny bit because it spreads out real well. The wife is always sneaking some too. Anyways, I would recommend this to anybody with dry skin.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about trying this stuff, but honestly it&#x27;s nothing special. I have combination skin that gets frequent clogged pores and occasional dry flaky skin around my nose. This basically seems like a hotel lotion they give you in those little bottles. Idk if it&#x27;s diluted or what. After I put it on like a half hour later you can&#x27;t even tell I put on any lotion. It&#x27;s great that you get so much for the price, but you have to use a lot more to get the desired effect. I would continue using this for body/neck, but it&#x27;s really not good enough for face if you are looking for a good facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> If I were stranded in the high mountain desert, and could only take one beauty product, this would be it. Moisturizing without being greasy, it has served me well in deserts, mountains, beaches, and just about anywhere else you can do drying damage to your skin. I wouldnt be without it.</li>
    <li> I have been using St. Ives hand lotion for years, so I thought I would give this a try. Because of the low price, I didn&#x27;t expect much. But I have been beyond surprised at how great it works. I have used just about everything you can buy in a drugstore, all the name brands, and this is by far the best product I have used. I will continue using this. I even started using it on my hands, and they look younger too!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer.  It doesn&#x27;t have a oily or sticky feel.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed much of anything regarding improvement in skin. Not sure it moisturizes all that well. My skin feels tight after applying like I haven&#x27;t applied anything at all. I had high hope for this because of the price and the positive reviews. But I guess you get what you pay for. Not impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> Better than my LaMer moisturizer. It&#x27;s amazing I have spent thousands this year on Face Creams, Eye Creams and Masks but nothing beats the affordable stuff. I have always like the St. Ives Apricot scrub and other products but didn&#x27;t think I would like the moisturizer this much. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dewy looking but it feels soft and keeps my skin from drying out. I even use it on my eyes under my regular La Mer eye cream.</li>
    <li> A great and inexpensive moisturizer. Very satisfied with the product, it&#x27;s as good as the expensive moisturizers I&#x27;ve wasted a lot of money on. Love this tub.</li>
    <li> It leaves my skin feeling smooth. I know this is for the face, but there is enough product to use it on your arms, hands, or legs.</li>
    <li> I have very dry and sensitive skin I decided to try this after buying several expensive brands and this works great!!! I&#x27;m so happy I gave it a try. My new favorite product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any magical results but I do like the cream, it&#x27;s not heavy, and my skin feels dewy. ( using 2nd jar) I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This cream is okay, but not as thick I like for a facial cream.  But the jar is very large for the price.</li>
    <li> seems a bit watery, havent seen significant results</li>
    <li> No noticeable difference in my skin and I didn&#x27;t like the smell, but it is definitely a generous size that lasted a long time!</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;m a beauty product snob.  I spend way too much on products and have even dropped $200+ on that miracle face cream from the sea.  So, when I say this huge, under $10 cream works, I&#x27;m shocked just as much as you provably are.  I layer it on over my face oil, so that does add extra moisturizer to my dry, sensitive skin.  But, I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year and am happy to report that it&#x27;s still working and saving me tons of money!  I&#x27;ve also found adding a couple drops of frankense oil to the cream container boosts the benefits to my skin and helps make it smell even better and more natural.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s affordable enough moisturizer that I can use it generously on my entire face, neck and chest. It&#x27;s light and rubs in cleanly. I would recommend it for every day use. I even mixed it with tea tree oil to make my own moisturizer that is not over drying.</li>
    <li> I think this product is fine. It is a heavy moisturizer but it is for collagen/elastin. I am only 24 but I have severely dry skin and damaged skin from acne and will be using this with a retin-A cream. Hopefully this will be an affordable treatment. Some people on the reviews have complained about the smell but it is not strong or potent at all and isn&#x27;t unpleasant either.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to wear under my foundation that would keep my skin young and soft and had anti aging benefits and after using expensive and over advertised brands I finally found the perfect moisturizer! and for an amazing price! :) It makes my skin soo soft and keeps it hydrated without being really heavy and breaking me out. I have combination skin, mostly oily but can get a little dry around my mouth and forehead especially in the winter months. Its almost like a gel texture and absorbs quickly into my skin, I break out extremely easily so I was pleasantly surprised that this didn&#x27;t break me out once. Its also very soft and blends really well, a little definitely goes a long way. I did see some people were concerned about the second ingredient; mineral oil, a lot of people believe it causes breakouts and clogs pore but that is untrue, here are two sites you can check out that will explain this misconception and giving you another reason to try it!&lt;br /&gt;http://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/acne/_/Is-Mineral-Oil-Bad-For-Skin&lt;br /&gt;http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/acne/news/20050527/mineral-oil-cleared-of-pimple-rap</li>
    <li> Love this cream!  This is my 2nd jar.</li>
    <li> kind of leaves a shiny glossy look on skin and since i do not wear makeup it looks like my skin is super oily. but overall its pretty good for the price.</li>
    <li> This stuff is all you need for daytime. Fantastic and cheap</li>
    <li> Let me preface that I&#x27;ve used both drugstore and department store brands and have never, ever had any allergic reaction whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was encouraged by the positive reviews to give St. Ives facial moisturizer a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EPIC mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1: My neck (where I&#x27;d also applied the moisturizer) felt a little itchy and was a little red the following morning. That should&#x27;ve warned me but since I&#x27;d never had any reaction to 20+ moisturizers I&#x27;ve ever used, I ignored it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 2: was in a hurry and applied to my face only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 2 (evening), applied to clean face, neck and décolleté after showering and 2 hours later, my neck was on fire. I washed my face/neck/chest immediately and skin still irritated, I tried not to scratch my neck that was the most on-fire itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 3: I woke up this morning to my face looking pink and a big red welt of a pimple (like an insect bite) on my jaw and patchy dry flaky skin along my chin and jawline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the best? The BEST part is my neck that has angry, thick burgundy bands around my neck. The look like ligature marks, as if someone tried to strangle me with nylon rope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s bad. Really bad. I hope this scariness fades before my birthday on Tuesday (it&#x27;s now Saturday morning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so bad though, I think I&#x27;ll look like a strangulation victim for my birthday party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;ve been disappointed by products or felt ho-hum by their performance, I&#x27;ve never felt my skin burned and DISFIGURED by one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a disaster.</li>
    <li> My skin adores this moisturizer. Hydrating without being greasy, pleasant and natural smelling, I&#x27;d love to fill a bath with this stuff and sink in for a while. It makes my skin look and feel fresh. I was also pleasantly surprised with how big the container is.. I wont have to buy any more for a while, but when I do run out I&#x27;ll without-a-doubt be back on amazon for a refil. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love the light, fresh smell of this moisturizer. It makes my face smooth but it cause more breakouts of my acne and pimples. I have a sensitive skin and this is not advisable for those having oily face because it is not oil- free.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I use this stuff. It&#x27;s really smooth and awesome. What more can you ask for? I will never use another type of moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Wonderful moisture for my skin.  I have sensitive skin and this works well for me.</li>
    <li> You get a lot of product for a low price but I find I have to reapply multiple times in a day. I don&#x27;t find it effective as a night moisturizer, though it&#x27;s ok for the day under my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a scent, which is pretty, but in general I&#x27;m not a fan of scented facial products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I use this every night and just love it. I am always complimented on my skin and St. Ives has a big hand in that! I also only purchase animal friendly products and St. Ives is always a good one to buy.</li>
    <li> With very dry skin, I am always in search of a better moisturizer. I keep coming back to St. Ives. It is not the thickest, richest cream, but it really does lovely things for my skin. I love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap and it moisturizes, I love it.  I&#x27;m a bit on the young side so I don&#x27;t know how effective it is with the Collagen and Elastin, but I have been noticing my face looking smoother.  The main reason why I&#x27;m making this review is that people will know that the ingredient list on the page is wrong.  I bought this product a few days ago at a drug store and it&#x27;s completely (sort of) different.  Keep in mind, I am reading straight from my jar and typing this so there can be some typing errors and/or shortenings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Water, Mineral Oil, Propylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Stearic Acid, [Safflower] Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Hydrolyzed Elastin, Triethanolamine, Carbomer, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicane, Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can search up any of these listed, which I did, and I found that most of them were oils or other organic compounds to help the oils become more soluble.</li>
    <li> Really didnt feel like it did anything at all. Got to the point where I used it all the time just to be done with it.</li>
    <li> Smells nice leaves face smooth and soft</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase. We were very satisfied and would recommend this vendor to others. The experience was positive.</li>
    <li> I have been reading reviews on this product for a couple of weeks and I decided to try it.  I purchased it at WalMart (sorry Amazon it came in at $4.69 there, but I still love Amazon!).  I have been using it for a week now, and my husband is also on the band wagon.  I see a difference in my complexion, my skin tone is more even.  The marks from the occasional zits that I get (annoying at my age) are disappearing, or have blended into the skin tone.  My face looks healthy, has a I want to say \\&quot;glow\\&quot; to it.  Happy about this as during winter my skin seems to dry up and break out.  Typically my skin is a combi oily in some parts and dry in others.  This product just makes it look even all over - going back to the \\&quot;glow\\&quot; without it being shiney.  My husband is looking great too.  So far loving it!  The 10oz container will go a long way too!</li>
    <li> Large size, great value. A little too fragrant for me taste, but I am very sensitive to that. Not a bad buy for the price</li>
    <li> I have super sensative skin, and I think I&#x27;ve tried every moisturizer out there.  I normally use fragrance free Olay, unless I have hives, in which case I use Aveeno products.  So I&#x27;m having a normal skin day and put this on after my shower.  It feels really good!  Not greasy, sticky, or stingy. Feels great on hands too.  I will definately keep this in my daily routine.</li>
    <li> As a 22 year old, full time student (lack of sleep) and habitual smoker I felt like I should do my skin some justice after all the abuse and this has proven to be just what it needed.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but if it gets too oily or greasy from product (even my hair stuff) it will breakout. I do a dab of this on each cheek and forehead and give my neck a good amount after showers and I have yet to feel anything but hydrated with this.  Not only does it completely quench my tight skin after a hot shower that I can&#x27;t seem to pull myself out of, it&#x27;s really brought back a certain radiance, I swear!  No tired eyes or ashy looking skin.  The smell is just fine, and I&#x27;ve started using this with a bit of my liquid foundation in the morning which helps kind of save on the amount of makeup I use and it dries great without looking greasy and keeps it smooth, consistent and uncakey.  I recommended this to my mother, who always tells me to appreciate having skin that doesn&#x27;t need constant hydration so I think this will be perfect for her. Highly recommend this and I comes in a tub that should last me for ever. Seriously.</li>
    <li> I like the St. Ives facial moisturizer.  It is a creamy and non greasy moisturizer.  Don&#x27;t know about the reduction of fine wrinkles and the tone and firming aspects of this moisturizer yet.  Overall, I think it is a good moisturizer and hopefully it will prevent signs of aging.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m still young, and don&#x27;t really need the collagen in the moisturizer. But for the price, and the size, I thought this was a steal. My face is combination skin, so it gets really dry in certain places while oily in others. I really like this moisturizer because it keeps my face balanced. I&#x27;ve noticed that some (not all) of my pores (which are relatively large) have slightly lessened and my acne scars are less visible. I don&#x27;t know if this is due to this moisturizer or my face wash (which is just a generic face wash with no ingredients made more lessening the appearance of pores and scars). Whatever it is, I really like it. Since I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles or anything like that, I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in that.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I love is that the cream is really light, so you don&#x27;t need as much to fully moisturize your face! It doesn&#x27;t feel oily or thick on my face which is really nice for my acne prone face. I picture myself lasting a long time with this cream and I use it twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. Totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> Since I moved to here the weather is really dried out my skin, I got some spot and blackhead! I can&#x27;t use the produce that I used use. I need something not too oily and moisture well.  Then I found this one! It work well, so far so good. With this price, you really have nothing can complaint about!</li>
    <li> Great product to soften skin without causing pimples for sensitive skin people like myself. I would recommend this product to others...</li>
    <li> I try everything, and this was amazing! Loved the way my skin drank it up,&lt;br /&gt;looked hydrated &amp; toned, and there was no greasy feel.  Make-up went on smooth&lt;br /&gt;afterwards. HUGE jar and an amazing prize. I have paid much more for other&lt;br /&gt;facial products that did not do near what this did.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product. My skin tends to get dry during winter. This has helped to retain moisture and softness of my skin.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t see any difference on my skin after I used it for a while.</li>
    <li> I love the moisturizer- it is not sticky.  I have not used it long enough to tell if it is helping my complexion, but unlike other users here, I have not experienced any rash, nor has it made my face dry, flaky or itchy.&lt;br /&gt;The tub will last quite a long time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this since I was 17, I am 28 now. I have not found a better moisturizer for the money that offers such great results. I have sensitive skin and it has never been irritated by this product, even around my eyes.</li>
    <li> The only drawback for me is that it contains mineral oil.  Otherwise it would be rated 5 stars.  It goes on smoothly and lightly and feels great on my skin.  Makeup glides on after its use.</li>
    <li> ITs ok, Good for my skin, No strong smell or antthing</li>
    <li> I use it sometimes hoping it will work for my stretch marks on my belly. Ive used it with the derma roller.</li>
    <li> looked for this product for 3 years and finally found it  its the best skin cream in the usa none greater</li>
    <li> My skin def feels much softer.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer on the face, neck and hands, and it has been wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I love to spread a lot of it, so I&#x27;m very happy with the 10oz jar and price...&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how the results will be in a couple of years from now, but will review it again in the future for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have a little bit of acne/oily skin; and was a scared it could increase acne, but nope, it works just fine. No worries.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and no scent.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  My friend recommended it, and she was right.  My skin is very soft and I believe I look younger.  Maybe it is wishful thinking, but I do love using this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> The second day I seen a difference in my skin.. I actually it works on another part of the body.. great product I recommend</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe that a moisturizer this cheap, really works so well! Goes on nice and smooth and really helps with my dry skin. During the Minnesota winters, my skin gets really dry and this product is a big plus.</li>
    <li> I really liked this at first because it has a nice texture and I like the smell. However, after only two days of use it made me break out. At first I thought it was just chance but it continued happening so I stopped using it and my face cleared up. I was excited to find a cheap moisturizer because most are twice the price and smaller, but I guess I can see why this was inexpensive. I wish I was as lucky as the other people who had good reviews. It did make my skin softer but it&#x27;s not worth it to get pimples at the same time.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a change in lines/wrinkles, but I&#x27;m still hopeful. My skin feels great after using this- all the dryness is gone and it hasn&#x27;t resulted in any zits/whiteheads like heavier creams.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Thanks</li>
    <li> This product is NOT non-comedogenic - or at least, it hasn&#x27;t been for me.  I have very clear skin and rarely have breakouts - yet after 2 or 3 nights in a row of applying this, I break out.  At first I thought the break-outs were hormonally related, but I stopped using this moisturizer and went back to a vitamin A cream I had been using before, and the acne went away entire.  I waited another month, and tried going back to this cream - sure enough, acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s worse, the stuff is apparently just greasy enough that it causes mini-cysts for me.  I thought the little breakouts might go away after my skin adjusted to using this for awhile... but then, after 2-3 weeks, I developed little hard white bumps on my skin that didn&#x27;t go away even after stopping use of this moisturizer - and mini-cysts take a looooong time to clear up on their own.  I ended up going to a dermatologist and had to get a $30 prescription to clear them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to 10 months later, and I found my still-almost-full jar of St. Ives facial moisturizer.  &#x27;Maybe I was been imagining all the acne, and the cysts must have been caused by something else...&#x27; I thought, so I decided to give this another try...  Long story short, good thing I have some of that prescription left, because a cyst popped back up within a week, and acne to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess this stuff is going to have to be demoted to a hand moisturizer and I&#x27;ll hope it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores there too.  It&#x27;s a shame, too -  this is a value-priced jar of product that was highly rated and very popular on Amazon, so I had such high hopes...</li>
    <li> I have tried thisproduct not only on face, but hands and body.  No greasy residue or heavy feeling left on skin..</li>
    <li> i can&#x27;t think of a lady like me apply a good amount of sisley moisturizer daily (can&#x27;t afford it!!!&lt;br /&gt;but this big bottle of st ives says yes to my generous applying... it feels good on the whole body n i like its natural scent or rather no special scent. should always hav it among every lady&#x27;s cosmetic family</li>
    <li> This looks like a great product, my friend told me about it, so I ordered some to give it a go. I also ordered this book which I am very happy with - [[ASIN:B00CSTZ94I Coconut Flour (25 Delicious, Easy To Make Coconut Flour Recipes - Perfect Treats For a Gluten Free, Paleo or Celiac Diet)]]</li>
    <li> much needed, got to me fast. felt amazing.</li>
    <li> I have loved this stuff since I was a teen!  People always tell me how young I look - this stuff is a big part of it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this facial moisturizer for over ten years and love it. It&#x27;s thin and light and not heavily perfumed. Keeps skin moist and glowing without being too oily and causing break outs. My sister works for a high end cosmetic company and nothing compares to this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Huge jar, it&#x27;ll probably dry up before i can finish it all. Leaves a nice glow to my skin. I will be purchasing this again in a few months or so because it&#x27;s going to take at least that long to put a dent in it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very light cream and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. This is now my standard face cream</li>
    <li> The old formula was a lot better.  Took me forever to run through my first tub, but now the &amp;#34;new formula&amp;#34; is forcing me to spend money and explore alternatives.  I generally have sensitive skin and dislike having my face feel greasy from the moment I put this on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and find a better product.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about this product! It is affordable and I use in the morning and at night. My face feels soft and moisturized! I would recommend this to others!</li>
