### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>but I have tried Aveeno&#x27;s and Covergirl&#x27;s and wasn&#x27;t too terribly impressed by them.</li>
      <li>I am medium beige skin tone and the medium shade was perfect!</li>
      <li>Very impressed!!</li>
      <li>Best CC ever.</li>
      <li>I am very impressed with Alba and as for now I will continue to use this product until they discontinue this.</li>
      <li>I think Alba puts out some great products.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s been great.  </li>
      <li>I love the glow it leaves!</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>My favorite find this year!</li>
      <li>With the CC I skip the first two steps, so I wash my face, apply the CC and set it with a medium beige powder foundation (Gabriel Cosmetics/Zuzu Luxe) and gosh my skin looks FLAWLESS!</li>
      <li>I LOVE Alba skincare products!</li>
      <li>and I am in love with it!</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>This product covers nicely doesn&#x27;t make your face feel greasy or appear that you are wearing any coverage at all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty impressed with the coverage it gives while still feeling very light on my skin.</li>
      <li>With all the good herbal ingredients in there and the lack of chemical ingredients (not to mention the low price) I thought I had found the perfect makeup...</li>
      <li>CRUELTY FREE!! :-)</li>
      <li>Makes my skin look smooth and bright, and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.  </li>
      <li>Purchased this a month ago, and I love it.  </li>
      <li>Have used this product before and love the way it makes my skin feel....</li>
      <li>I love the Alba products and use many of their line.</li>
      <li>but I sure dislike it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t purchase this from Amazon, but I love it:)  </li>
      <li>Adding powder on top makes all the difference.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried too many of these BB/CC creams</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so lightweight and goes on so smoothly!</li>
      <li>and they love it:)</li>
      <li>Love the Alba Even Advance line.  </li>
      <li>I would prefer a bit more coverage</li>
      <li>It definitely evens out my skin tone and appears to be a perfect match for the color of my skin.</li>
      <li>I did not purchase it on amazon initially but might repurchase it here if it disappears from wallmart (as many good things do!).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep my other brand CC cream which works best with my oily skin.</li>
      <li>This CC cream applies nicely; a bit shiny at first but dries after a while.  </li>
      <li>I have more &#x27;golden&#x27; hues in my skin and this product works well for me.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know maybe I am use to Tinted Moisturizers and light coverage because to me this was to cakey</li>
      <li>and when i found it too light for my skin i bought the medium instead</li>
      <li>It is so smooth and bendable</li>
      <li>Use their daily cream and the Good &amp; Clean Pore Purifying Mini Peel (which I love).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m absolutely loving this CC cream, which is surprising because I&#x27;ve never consistently used liquid foundation or BB cream, just powder foundation.</li>
      <li>Love this one as it does reflect light and hides mild wrinkles leaving skin lightly tinted/covered and feeling very soft without overwhelming.</li>
      <li>love it - very light and does even out the skin - a natural look</li>
      <li>Overall this Alba Botanica CC Cream is very good and priced reasonably.</li>
      <li>Looks VERY natural, gives your face a nice glow and evens out the tone.</li>
      <li>I received my item quickly.</li>
      <li>I had bought the light first</li>
      <li>I tried the Physicians Formula Organic CC Cream recently and it seems to match my skin tone MUCH better!</li>
      <li>Even when i do mix them it doesn&#x27;t match my neutral undertones, it&#x27;s more pink-toned than I need it to be, but it doesn&#x27;t look so far off that I can&#x27;t wear it at all.</li>
      <li>Simple, smooth, and very effective against sunburn, even if applied only once a day.</li>
      <li>Goes on light and feels super natural</li>
      <li>I gasped the first time I applied it.</li>
      <li>My first thought was, &amp;#34;Ew!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
      <li>This is the first make up product I have used</li>
      <li>Great product and doesn&#x27;t have all the nasty stuff in it that does more harm than good to your skin.</li>
      <li>I am oily skinned and it is o.k, for cooler months with regular use of blotting tissues, thinner than aveeno for sure.</li>
      <li>I ordered the Light to Medium tint and the coverage is adequate for my 63 year old skin for a natural appearance during the day.  </li>
      <li>It is a light diffusing very natural tinted moisturizer with spf, similar to aveeno type but a bit lighter and more natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>but I went ahead and purchased due to the great reviews it has; it definitely deserves them!</li>
      <li>time, I appreciated how it covered.</li>
      <li>I absolutely recommend trying it.</li>
      <li>I did not like the product as it made my face very greasy.</li>
      <li>I am not suffering from any acne scars or zits, however I do have a very oily skin and it needs evening out.</li>
      <li>The color becomes more pink as it soaks in but does indeed even things out.</li>
      <li>it also covers and smooths out  completion very well.</li>
      <li>It has a thick, smooth texture and goes on easily.  </li>
      <li>Not only does it work well on my skin, but I have had several people tell me that I smell good and ask me what I am wearing, they think it is a perfume, but it is actually the Alba they are smelling</li>
      <li>but I will obviously have to apply a foundation to achieve full coverage.  </li>
      <li>This CC Cream has decent,  I would call it medium-to-full coverage.  </li>
      <li>Like the idea of it being all in one moisturizer and sunscreen but would like a little better coverage and not so oily.</li>
      <li>I have pretty dry skin, so the formula is really good to give me a dewy look, but not ideal when it is super hot outside, as it makes your face look greasy.</li>
      <li>Light enough to not feel like you&#x27;re not wearing anything, and covered enough to look like I was wearing makeup.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>It does not cause reaction or clog pores like some BB/CC creams, of which Garners is my other favorite especially medium one for summer months of tan (yet Garners is a bit heavier just like Aveeno tinted spf).</li>
      <li>It does the same and it moisturizes very well.  </li>
      <li>(even looks natural in sunlight - no makeupy look).  </li>
      <li>So if you have some neutral or golden undertones (because the Alba is certainly PINK!)</li>
      <li>The only reason I give it four stars is because it goes on a bit oily looking, so I usually apply a thin layer of powder on top if I want more coverage.</li>
      <li>Being an Alba Botanica adorer, I typically like their product&#x27;s fresh fragrances.</li>
      <li>I have a spotty uneven skin tone and this is my super CC.</li>
      <li>I  like this product, I mixed with mineral makeup powder to get correct color on my skin ,easy and quicker than putting on  ordinary  makeup.</li>
      <li>I always hate trying a new product, waiting to see if a breakout occurs - especially a product with SPF, but no problems here (like to let people know, I am a 38  year old woman with good skin).  </li>
      <li>, apparently, though, I&#x27;m somewhere in the middle</li>

<li> I caught my reflection in the car door mirror the other day and was surprised at how radiant my face looked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried Physicians Formula Organic and it was chalky and a little more expensive than this.  </li>
<li> They didn&#x27;t seem to have any real coverage and always felt like an unnecessary extra step.</li>
<li> It leaves my skin looking very luminous and radiant but not oily/greasy, which is a hard combo to find!</li>
<li> My skin is quite red, uneven, dry and blotchy.</li>
<li> Its a little darker than I would like on me but doesn&#x27;t give me that obvious &#x27;line&#x27;.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very active, and it holds up on long bike rides, hikes and runs.</li>
<li> Hope this product save my face without using any other sunscreen because I dislike sun tan due to melasma  problem.</li>
<li> Also, sticky feeling compared to some other organic bb and cc creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
<li> I tried other BB and CC creams - Garnier, Almay, Neutorgena, Revlon, Maybelline, Loreal - This baby beats them all!</li>
<li> After putting this on, I add concealer over any blemishes and any dark circles under my eyes, and it leaves me needing less concealer too.</li>
<li> check that stuff out, it&#x27;s less sticky too :</li>
<li> I gave 4 stars because it has a slightly grayish color to it.</li>
<li> If you have spots or uneven skin, this one&#x27;s for you.</li>
<li> Goes on smoothly, no oily feeling or orange line.</li>
<li> Helps cover the small imperfections but doesn&#x27;t make me look like a doll either.</li>
<li> I was disappointed at first but have come to like</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s all that&#x27;s needed for a foundation.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this from Amazon, but I love it:)  Not only does it work well on my skin, but I have had several people tell me that I smell good and ask me what I am wearing, they think it is a perfume, but it is actually the Alba they are smelling and they love it:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely loving this CC cream, which is surprising because I&#x27;ve never consistently used liquid foundation or BB cream, just powder foundation. I haven&#x27;t tried too many of these BB/CC creams but I have tried Aveeno&#x27;s and Covergirl&#x27;s and wasn&#x27;t too terribly impressed by them. They didn&#x27;t seem to have any real coverage and always felt like an unnecessary extra step. I was afraid of that happening with this CC cream also but I went ahead and purchased due to the great reviews it has; it definitely deserves them! I&#x27;m pretty impressed with the coverage it gives while still feeling very light on my skin. It definitely evens out my skin tone and appears to be a perfect match for the color of my skin. It leaves my skin looking very luminous and radiant but not oily/greasy, which is a hard combo to find! After putting this on, I add concealer over any blemishes and any dark circles under my eyes, and it leaves me needing less concealer too. After concealer I use some pressed powder foundation which keeps my skin from getting oily throughout the day, so my skin stays oil-free but still looks radiant. Very impressed!!</li>
    <li> WOW! Best CC ever. I will never spend money on another. This one takes the cake. I have a spotty uneven skin tone and this is my super CC. If you have spots or uneven skin, this one&#x27;s for you.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know maybe I am use to Tinted Moisturizers and light coverage because to me this was to cakey</li>
    <li> I did not purchase it on amazon initially but might repurchase it here if it disappears from wallmart (as many good things do!). It is a light diffusing very natural tinted moisturizer with spf, similar to aveeno type but a bit lighter and more natural ingredients. I am oily skinned and it is o.k, for cooler months with regular use of blotting tissues, thinner than aveeno for sure. It does not cause reaction or clog pores like some BB/CC creams, of which Garners is my other favorite especially medium one for summer months of tan (yet Garners is a bit heavier just like Aveeno tinted spf). Read on BB &amp; CC on Paula Beagon (spelling?) site. Love this one as it does reflect light and hides mild wrinkles leaving skin lightly tinted/covered and feeling very soft without overwhelming. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different of course ...</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly, no oily feeling or orange line. Have reordered.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. My acne prone skin soaks this up and has never had a problem with it. I absolutely recommend trying it. It is cheaper on Amazon than in Target.</li>
    <li> This CC cream applies nicely; a bit shiny at first but dries after a while.  I apply and leave it on for at least five minutes before applying blush, etc.  I ordered the Light to Medium tint and the coverage is adequate for my 63 year old skin for a natural appearance during the day.  I would prefer a bit more coverage but I will obviously have to apply a foundation to achieve full coverage.  Overall this Alba Botanica CC Cream is very good and priced reasonably.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Alba skincare products! I have everything from moisturizer and eye makeup remover to shampoo and conditioners! This is the first make up product I have used and I am in love with it! I bought this CC cream at my local target. I am medium beige skin tone and the medium shade was perfect! It&#x27;s so lightweight and goes on so smoothly! Looks VERY natural, gives your face a nice glow and evens out the tone. You cannot use it alone as a foundation for maximum coverage however you can mix a dot of this CC with your regular liquid foundation and it creates miracles!!! This CC cream changed my entire foundation  routine! Before I after washing my face I would moisturize it, prime it, apply liquid foundation then set it with a powder. With the CC I skip the first two steps, so I wash my face, apply the CC and set it with a medium beige powder foundation (Gabriel Cosmetics/Zuzu Luxe) and gosh my skin looks FLAWLESS! I am not suffering from any acne scars or zits, however I do have a very oily skin and it needs evening out. I tried other BB and CC creams - Garnier, Almay, Neutorgena, Revlon, Maybelline, Loreal - This baby beats them all!</li>
    <li> love it - very light and does even out the skin - a natural look</li>
    <li> Great product and doesn&#x27;t have all the nasty stuff in it that does more harm than good to your skin.</li>
    <li> Like the idea of it being all in one moisturizer and sunscreen but would like a little better coverage and not so oily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now and it&#x27;s been great.  I was using Dermalogica brand, and at $48-$52 per bottle it was no wonder I was seeking an alternate.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  It does the same and it moisturizes very well.  I&#x27;ve tried Physicians Formula Organic and it was chalky and a little more expensive than this.  I am very impressed with Alba and as for now I will continue to use this product until they discontinue this.</li>
    <li> Also, sticky feeling compared to some other organic bb and cc creams I&#x27;ve tried. I had bought the light first and when i found it too light for my skin i bought the medium instead, apparently, though, I&#x27;m somewhere in the middle so I have to i mix them both. Even when i do mix them it doesn&#x27;t match my neutral undertones, it&#x27;s more pink-toned than I need it to be, but it doesn&#x27;t look so far off that I can&#x27;t wear it at all. The texture is thick although it does blend evenly. With all the good herbal ingredients in there and the lack of chemical ingredients (not to mention the low price) I thought I had found the perfect makeup... and it could be worse, but it&#x27;s not perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** UPDATE*** I tried the Physicians Formula Organic CC Cream recently and it seems to match my skin tone MUCH better! So if you have some neutral or golden undertones (because the Alba is certainly PINK!) check that stuff out, it&#x27;s less sticky too :)***</li>
    <li> This CC Cream has decent,  I would call it medium-to-full coverage.  It has a thick, smooth texture and goes on easily.  I gave 4 stars because it has a slightly grayish color to it. I will still use it because I cannot tell after I use my bronzer.</li>
    <li> Have used this product before and love the way it makes my skin feel....it also covers and smooths out  completion very well.</li>
    <li> Purchased this a month ago, and I love it.  Goes on light and feels super natural (even looks natural in sunlight - no makeupy look).  Makes my skin look smooth and bright, and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.  I always hate trying a new product, waiting to see if a breakout occurs - especially a product with SPF, but no problems here (like to let people know, I am a 38  year old woman with good skin).  Love the Alba Even Advance line.  Use their daily cream and the Good &amp; Clean Pore Purifying Mini Peel (which I love).  I think Alba puts out some great products.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed at first but have come to like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m used to BB Creams, so the consistency was off-putting. I gasped the first time I applied it. It&#x27;s thick, sticky and grayish looking. My first thought was, &amp;#34;Ew!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over time, I appreciated how it covered. My skin is quite red, uneven, dry and blotchy. The color becomes more pink as it soaks in but does indeed even things out. I love the glow it leaves! I caught my reflection in the car door mirror the other day and was surprised at how radiant my face looked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest issue is the smell. Being an Alba Botanica adorer, I typically like their product&#x27;s fresh fragrances. This one is unpleasant. It fades (I think) but I sure dislike it.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely keep buying it.</li>
    <li> I  like this product, I mixed with mineral makeup powder to get correct color on my skin ,easy and quicker than putting on  ordinary  makeup.Hope this product save my face without using any other sunscreen because I dislike sun tan due to melasma  problem.</li>
    <li> I love the Alba products and use many of their line. I have more &#x27;golden&#x27; hues in my skin and this product works well for me. Its a little darker than I would like on me but doesn&#x27;t give me that obvious &#x27;line&#x27;. It does cake after being in humid environments, which is unfortunate. Helps cover the small imperfections but doesn&#x27;t make me look like a doll either. I will be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Love this product! The only reason I give it four stars is because it goes on a bit oily looking, so I usually apply a thin layer of powder on top if I want more coverage. I have pretty dry skin, so the formula is really good to give me a dewy look, but not ideal when it is super hot outside, as it makes your face look greasy. Adding powder on top makes all the difference.</li>
    <li> This product covers nicely doesn&#x27;t make your face feel greasy or appear that you are wearing any coverage at all.</li>
    <li> It is so smooth and bendable</li>
    <li> I received my item quickly. I did not like the product as it made my face very greasy. I will not purchase again. I&#x27;ll keep my other brand CC cream which works best with my oily skin.</li>
    <li> My favorite find this year! Simple, smooth, and very effective against sunburn, even if applied only once a day. I&#x27;m very active, and it holds up on long bike rides, hikes and runs.</li>
    <li> Light enough to not feel like you&#x27;re not wearing anything, and covered enough to look like I was wearing makeup.&lt;br /&gt;And Bonus...CRUELTY FREE!! :-)</li>
