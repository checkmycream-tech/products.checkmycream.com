      <li>This is a good price for a proven performer.</li>
      <li>I think the product, what I could get out of  the bottle, felt good on my skin.  </li>
      <li>Now, I use it nightly; remember per doctor, to use a good moisturizer about 15\\&quot; to 30\\&quot; after putting retinol on.</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>But I LOVE IT!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>then I do recommend it as it works amazing at softening the skin.</li>
      <li>It is AMAZING.</li>
      <li>I am sure the product is good, but I will not buy the product in a pump dispenser again.</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to receive this product as a gift.  </li>
      <li>Still get good peeling though for baby-butt smooth skin!</li>
      <li>The product came in perfect condition and very timely.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant aroma, is creamy and easy to spread.</li>
      <li>This is a nice light cream.</li>
      <li>but now I love it</li>
      <li>It is more like a lotion.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t start on my  face :).</li>
      <li>We love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m the type of person who thinks more is better.</li>
      <li>I like neostrata the most</li>
      <li>I now use the 0.5 nightly and my face looks better than it has in years.</li>
      <li>Although I know that you are supposed to use this more often as you age.</li>
      <li>I have had relentless sun (age) spots for many years.  </li>
      <li>You will be glad you did.</li>
      <li>The appearance of my skin is so much better and smoother.</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>The texture is great, but still too early to say about beneffits.  </li>
      <li>The seller was very quick in processing and shipping my order.</li>
      <li>Please try to solve this problema, you must be available to accept returns</li>
      <li>Overall fair value for the amount of product you get for your money.</li>
      <li>The 0.5 is not as strong and I should have used this first to ease my way up to the 1%.  </li>
      <li>This product felt nice on my skin, and my skin was just starting to purge itself when I quit using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a product that costs as much as it does, you&#x27;d expect to get more than 3 uses out of it.  </li>
      <li>and it makes my skin look supple and fresh.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing but must be used in moderation because using it too often will do the exact opposite of its job and make you break out.</li>
      <li>After reading the reviews of this product I was prepared to expect a little irritation but then good results.  </li>
      <li>this 0.5 is super strong, I can only use it sparingly.</li>
      <li>However, when you first begin using it, BEWARE.</li>
      <li>but I hope for a better packaging in the future.</li>
      <li>The reward is that shortly after using it, my skin does look better.</li>
      <li>And living in Southern California does not make it any better.  </li>
      <li>This is my first experience with Retinol.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s actually quite moisturizing, not drying like most retinols are.</li>
      <li>I email Skinceuticals and they said to imerse the container into hot water and hit in on a counter.</li>
      <li>This is my first retinol cream I have ever tried, as it was recommended for me to use one by this estetician.</li>
      <li>I just use a super duty moisturizer and my dry skin is fine with it.</li>
      <li>but I expected some more on results, and how fast they would show up.</li>
      <li>I was really looking forward to using the product but was very disapponted.  </li>
      <li>I have not seen much of a difference</li>
      <li>Skin is fresh and soft after this product.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t tell much of a difference while using this product.</li>
      <li>You really don&#x27;t need a lot for it to work.  </li>
      <li>But, other than that, I love this product.</li>
      <li>but after that I have noticed my complexion more even and fewer and shorter breakouts, which should be due to the purging of the skin.</li>
      <li>I first bought this from my dermatologist for my 60 yr old plus skin.</li>
      <li>a lot of other reviews say , second I guess you kind of get what you pay for,  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a few retinol products and this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t waste my money</li>
      <li>Go on skinceutical&#x27;s website and you&#x27;ll find 2+ years worth of complaints from people who say that they can only get 2-5 uses out of the pump.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and so was surprised that it caused no irritation for the first week.  </li>
      <li>My skin is like combination/oily but also very sensitive.</li>
      <li>When the pump stopped working on my first bottle, I opened it and found I still had sufficient cream left for another week.</li>
      <li>Frankly I think the company should be sued for continuing to sell this, as I&#x27;m not sure most of the pumps even have an ounce of product in them.</li>
      <li>my skin got worse the first two weeks (in the sense of more breakouts)</li>
      <li>Works wonders on my skin,u need to be patient to notice considerable difference,usualy</li>
      <li>I like the Skin Ceuticals line of products, but have always been sensitive about retinol.  </li>
      <li>So I emailed the seller and was reassured that he purchased it directly from the manufacturer.</li>
      <li>I am 31 years old and still suffer of acne; after I started using this product I noticed</li>
      <li>This product works well as a non-prescription retinol for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I am not impressed, it is just an ok cosmetic product, next time I &#x27;d rather spend the extra money and get something better</li>
      <li>However, after several minutes of pumping, absolutely nothing came out.</li>
      <li>and you should not waste yours.  </li>
      <li>any where near my mouth or I break out with herpes.</li>
      <li>My main problem was these tiny bumps on my cheeks that wouldn&#x27;t go away, and also blackheads and blemishes.</li>
      <li>There are a few lucky ones that seem to have no trouble at all, but they are in the minority.  </li>
      <li>It is not what expected, first the pump is deffective just like</li>
      <li>First two weeks some burning, so I backed off to every other day.</li>
      <li>My skin peeled a little at first so the first week of using this product was rough</li>
      <li>It is disappointing because I think the Retinol is a good product, the dispenser is just non-functional.</li>
      <li>First week, every three nights after cleansing; second week, every other night; third week every night.  </li>
      <li>For those having problems with the dispenser -- but it in boiling hot water for a few minutes.</li>
      <li>For what this product costs, you could get a small tube of generic Retin A (tretinoin) and get 2 or 3 months&#x27; worth of use instead of 3 whopping nights.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My skin started to peel from the second day of using it.  The t-zone which usually is oily started to feel itchy and dry.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend even the 0.5 for those with sensitive skin.....</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews of this product I was prepared to expect a little irritation but then good results.  I have sensitive skin and so was surprised that it caused no irritation for the first week.  I was even a little skeptical that maybe it had hit the expiration date but couldn&#x27;t find an expiration date on the box.  So I emailed the seller and was reassured that he purchased it directly from the manufacturer. I am combining this with another moisturizer and am seeing some results (very minimal) but not sure if it is this cream or the other one or the combination that is working.  If I do purchase this cream again, I&#x27;ll try the 1.0 strength.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m ordering this today after using three sample sizes provided by my wonderful aesthetician.  FYI...she adds directions which state: First week, every three nights after cleansing; second week, every other night; third week every night.  Then adjust as needed.  Very good counsel.  Otherwise, for me especially with rosacea, it could be too irritating.  But I LOVE IT!  Makes my skin feel great.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what it does over the next 3-6 months.</li>
    <li> The container won&#x27;t depense the product. I email Skinceuticals and they said to imerse the container into hot water and hit in on a counter. I have to do that each time I use it so  finally just squirted a bunch of product into another container.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe the difference this product has made. The appearance of my skin is so much better and smoother.</li>
    <li> This is a nice light cream. It is more like a lotion. I prefer to put it on in the morning after showering. It compares well to Natural Advantage and is less expensive and easier to purchase. There is no need sign up and get all the extra products it comes with. I would suggest a plain old plastic squeeze tube. I don&#x27;t see any benefit with the pump considering all the problems people are having with it.</li>
    <li> This product works well as a non-prescription retinol for sensitive skin.  I would recommend starting out applying a small amount only every 3 days or so (before bed) because there will be some dryness and peeling. Use a moisturizer in the morning. Then gradually increase use.</li>
    <li> I use to use it every other day and then again in 2 or 3 weeks... I can see results...</li>
    <li> I have not used the entire tube yet. I have not seen much of a difference and I am using it about every couple of days. I will gradually increase to every other night. Thinking I should have bought a little stronger formula, but only time can tel</li>
    <li> I could not get the dispenser to work! I had heard how great this product was but I never got the chance to try it due to the lousy dispenser!!!</li>
    <li> This product felt nice on my skin, and my skin was just starting to purge itself when I quit using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a product that costs as much as it does, you&#x27;d expect to get more than 3 uses out of it.  I bought this product from a local plastic surgeon and got 3 uses out of it.  I returned it, and was given another and got 3 uses out of that one.  I tried the smacking the bottle method, holding the pump upside down and pumping like crazy, and all of the other \\&quot;fixes\\&quot; for this horrid packaging that have been offered.  For what this product costs, you could get a small tube of generic Retin A (tretinoin) and get 2 or 3 months&#x27; worth of use instead of 3 whopping nights.  Go on skinceutical&#x27;s website and you&#x27;ll find 2+ years worth of complaints from people who say that they can only get 2-5 uses out of the pump.  There are a few lucky ones that seem to have no trouble at all, but they are in the minority.  Frankly I think the company should be sued for continuing to sell this, as I&#x27;m not sure most of the pumps even have an ounce of product in them.</li>
    <li> I too have some issues with he pump but I did get it to work after pumping it several times.  You also have to keep it upright.  As for the people who say they only got a few uses out of it must be using WAY too much at one time.  You really don&#x27;t need a lot for it to work.  As for the product I think it works great.  I&#x27;m only 33 so I don&#x27;t have a ton of wrinkles, but I do have uneven skin due to former bad acne.  This product has helped even out my skin great.</li>
    <li> I am 31 years old and still suffer of acne; after I started using this product I noticed my skin got worse the first two weeks (in the sense of more breakouts) but after that I have noticed my complexion more even and fewer and shorter breakouts, which should be due to the purging of the skin. Will upgrade to the 1.0. Love it!</li>
    <li> No major difference to be seen yet; however after a bit of research, I should be seeing results after a few months of diligent use. The seller was very quick in processing and shipping my order. No problems whatsoever.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like peeling, just much less harsh.  Of course, the outer layer of my skin pealed off at the beginning - that&#x27;s the nature of the beast.  I use Retinol cream only twice per week and even this shows the results.  Skin is fresh and soft after this product. Love it.  The only thing that I need to mention is that I got a tube of cream, instead of the shown on the picture pump.  Not a problem for me, I actually prefer creams in tubes - at least I know that I will get the last drop of the product out of it - but the picture should adhere to what is shipped.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few retinol products and this is my favorite. It&#x27;s actually quite moisturizing, not drying like most retinols are. Still get good peeling though for baby-butt smooth skin!</li>
    <li> I have hyperpigmentation so I definitely want to use a Retinol product, but I also have sensative skin so I have to be very careful of the strength.  This is perfect.  I&#x27;m still getting the benefit of Retinol but at a lower dosage so I don&#x27;t have the extreme peeling, redness, sensativity, etc.  This is very nice!</li>
    <li> Works well and is beautiful. We love it.</li>
    <li> The product comes in a pump dispenser that does not work for me.  I contacted the seller and they told me, \\&quot;Please tap the bottom of the bottle agsint the palm of your hand and the pump will work fine.\\&quot;    That still did not work.  I am sure the product is good, but I will not buy the product in a pump dispenser again.</li>
    <li> It is not what expected, first the pump is deffective just like a lot of other reviews say , second I guess you kind of get what you pay for,  I am not impressed, it is just an ok cosmetic product, next time I &#x27;d rather spend the extra money and get something better</li>
    <li> I ignored  the reviews regarding the problem pump, and now  I regret it. I bought the product used it a few times and now it doesnt pump anymore. This pump is a joke ! I emailed the company for a refund. If I get it thats good, if not I will just throw it in the garbage. Will not be buying any of there products again</li>
    <li> it is very good but I expected some more on results, and how fast they would show up. I like neostrata the most</li>
    <li> I am highly disappointed that I spent $45 on a product I was only able to use 4 times. The pump no longer works and the container is impossible to open. I&#x27;m currently looking for my receipt and will be asking for an exchange.</li>
    <li> Skinceuticals still did not solved the pump issue. MyBetterSkinCare was great on exchanging the item. I will buy again but I hope for a better packaging in the future.</li>
    <li> Please believe all the reviews that discuss the issues with the pump. After reading all those reviews, I took a chance and purchased the product anyway hoping I wouldn&#x27;t encounter the same problem.  However, after several minutes of pumping, absolutely nothing came out. I tried, my husband tried, nothing, nothing, and nothing.  So disappointed.  Thought I would then try to unscrew the pump from the bottle and get the product out that way, but even that is impossible. Please don&#x27;t bother, you will likely be disappointed. Save yourself the aggregation and try something else.</li>
    <li> The pump does not work properly  Its a very expensive product to have this kind of problem.  The texture is great, but still too early to say about beneffits.  Arrived as said, on time.</li>
    <li> I use this at the first hint of a cystic blemish and it knocks it out before it has the chance to form or become painful!! It is AMAZING. I agree with the other reviews...this 0.5 is super strong, I can only use it sparingly. Can&#x27;t imagine what the 1.0 is like. Absolutely love this product.</li>
    <li> I first bought this from my dermatologist for my 60 yr old plus skin. It has been wonderful. It has smoothed, softened, and helped with discoloration. It has a pleasant aroma, is creamy and easy to spread. First two weeks some burning, so I backed off to every other day. Now, I use it nightly; remember per doctor, to use a good moisturizer about 15\\&quot; to 30\\&quot; after putting retinol on. Waiting allows retinol to soak into facial skin. My BIG complaint on this brand is the packaging.When the pump stopped working on my first bottle, I opened it and found I still had sufficient cream left for another week. On the bottle I ordered from this site, the pump never even worked. Since I had thrown out the packing slip, I opened(with pliers and cutters) the container and put the cream into a small opaque container. The next time I will try another brand, or hope that Skinceuticals changes the container.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped. Have not really noticed any difference in skin tone.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to receive this product as a gift.  However, it had a funky smell, so before putting it on my face I called customer service.  Even though I had the lot number, the agent would not tell me the product&#x27;s expiration date.  So now I am stuck with a tube of this stuff I can&#x27;t try out unless I want to risk a bad reaction.  Unless you buy the product yourself from an authorized dealer, no one will help you or answer any questions about the product.  They will not even tell you the shelf life.  The woman was so rude, I will never purchase a product from this company.  I also found out they are part of L&#x27;Oreal and test their products on animals.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t waste my money and you should not waste yours.  Give your money to a company that respects people using their products (and animals).</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t exfoliated your skin for awhile, this will definitely do the trick! I wish I had done a peel beforehand. Retinol is the only scientifically recognized means of regenerating skin elasticity. This is a good price for a proven performer.</li>
    <li> Good product.Works wonders on my skin,u need to be patient to notice considerable difference,usualy it takes from 3 to 6 month,but what you ll see,is your face but 5 years younger,.</li>
    <li> I think the product, what I could get out of  the bottle, felt good on my skin.  The pump dispenser, however, is just like everyone else says, DEFECTIVE.  I called the Skinceuticals company to see if there was a \\&quot;trick\\&quot; to getting the dispenser to work.  They told me to bang the bottle as hard as I could several times, then push the pump slowly to get the product to come out.  This worked a few times, but then even that ceased.  I ended up returning the bottle to Amazon.  I am not going to pay for product I can&#x27;t actually get to!  It is disappointing because I think the Retinol is a good product, the dispenser is just non-functional.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how well this works because I ignored the problems others had since this product seemed to have EVERYTHING I have been looking for in a quality retinol product. But the pump does not work and Skinceuticals still has not gotten the message.</li>
    <li> I should have believed the other reviews regarding the pump.  I was really looking forward to using the product but was very disapponted.  The pump did not work at all. I am returning and looking for a different brand.</li>
    <li> skinceutils retinol 0.5 refining night cream, 1- fluid ounce seem to do what my wife bought it for, i don&#x27;t dare say otherwise, cuz she might read this</li>
    <li> My skin peeled a little at first so the first week of using this product was rough but now I love it and it makes my skin look supple and fresh.</li>
    <li> I do think this product will eventually yeild favorable results. However, when you first begin using it, BEWARE. I broke out in a terrbile rash all over my chest. Good thing I didn&#x27;t start on my  face :).</li>
    <li> I was using the .1% a couple of times a week.  The 0.5 is not as strong and I should have used this first to ease my way up to the 1%.  I now use the 0.5 nightly and my face looks better than it has in years. You will need to bear through the &amp;#34;breaking in&amp;#34; period though.  You will be glad you did.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks. I&#x27;m the type of person who thinks more is better. Not with this product! Follow the instructions! I used it every night for about three days, and the fourth morning I woke up with a red, swollen face. It took two days for the aftermath to subside. But, other than that, I love this product. I already see my forehead wrinkles shrinking. Also, it came in a tube, not a pump. And there is a lot of product in the tube, which makes it a good value for the money. I will write another review after I have used the product for a while longer.</li>
    <li> I have had relentless sun (age) spots for many years.  And living in Southern California does not make it any better.  Since I started mixing a dab of Skinceuticals Retinol 0.5  with a dab of the PCA skin pigment gel, it took me about 6 weeks to start noticing the improvement at a fraction of the cost of the well-known prescription products.  I am very happy with I see on the mirror, and plan to continue using both products together.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell much of a difference while using this product. Overall fair value for the amount of product you get for your money.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with Retinol. The product came in perfect condition and very timely. I am so looking forward to seeing the results.</li>
    <li> I like the Skin Ceuticals line of products, but have always been sensitive about retinol.  Although I know that you are supposed to use this more often as you age. I have a hard time using it regularly, because I have a period of a few days after applying it where my skin looks worse. I have to be careful not to use it any where near my mouth or I break out with herpes. The reward is that shortly after using it, my skin does look better.</li>
    <li> my opinión is about Geo Marketing, I want to return product because Courier can t send it, but they don t want, I don t understand the reason because the returning is within days they let you return products. Please try to solve this problema, you must be available to accept returns</li>
    <li> This is my first retinol cream I have ever tried, as it was recommended for me to use one by this estetician. My skin is like combination/oily but also very sensitive. My main problem was these tiny bumps on my cheeks that wouldn&#x27;t go away, and also blackheads and blemishes. I started using it twice a week and I applied it before my moisturizer then applied my moisturizer 30min later to let the retinol seep into my skin. It immediately tightens your skin and it can be itchy too. I used it for about a month, but after the 2nd treatment my skin started flaking sooo bad and I had painful blemishes everywhere. I know that this is how retinol works, but I just couldn&#x27;t take it. I was also tired of having super flaky skin and feeling swollen and in pain. If you can handle all of that then I do recommend it as it works amazing at softening the skin.</li>
    <li> Came as described. For those having problems with the dispenser -- but it in boiling hot water for a few minutes. It will ease up the product in the bottle and you will never have to do this again. (Personal experience) Hope it works. This stuff is amazing but must be used in moderation because using it too often will do the exact opposite of its job and make you break out.</li>
    <li> A little drying, but it keeps my skin clear and diminishes wrinkles. I just use a super duty moisturizer and my dry skin is fine with it.</li>
