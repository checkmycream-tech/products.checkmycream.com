      <li>Make sure you find the right brand razor blade for your face, i think you will be happy with this razor.</li>
      <li>I prefer the Parker Safety Razor - 91R for shaving nice close shave, way more aggressive than this Weishi, both however are fine razors.    </li>
      <li>All that being said, I am still on the hunt for a better razor, for my comfort and style of shaving.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve moved on to a better one since purchasing this.</li>
      <li>so what more could you want?</li>

      <li>This razor is a great razor for the first time users of DE shaving,   well built, solid construction, nice movement of parts and blades are well centered when inserted in the razor its self,      </li>
      <li>I actually enjoy shaving now.</li>
      <li>The bottom just spins freely.  </li>

      <li>Not a bad safety razor to start with.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!!  </li>
      <li>I found this double edge safety razor to be well made and very user friendly to the point exactly what I was looking for a good shave at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I was turning it the right way</li>
      <li>I gave it 5 start its exactly like the picture said.</li>
      <li>If you have a moderate to light beard, this may be the razor for you!</li>
      <li>how well I try, I have a fairly course beard and somewhat heavy growth, but while it doesn&#x27;t allow me a close shave, I also have no razor burn at all.     </li>
      <li>Its no secret that a i love the WEISHI Double Edge Safety Razors!</li>
      <li>This razor is very smooth, and the blades last a long time, just keep them clean.</li>
      <li>reminds me of years ago when I first started shaving I highly recommend this razor</li>
      <li>For a great shave, learn the proper technic for wet shaving and get rid of the plastic-fantastic garbage razors that they have been telling you to buy all of these years!!!  </li>
      <li>Heavy duty, easy to clean</li>
      <li>, very close shave with this.</li>
      <li>will never go back to cheap plastic multi blade razors.</li>
      <li>I get a much closer, cleaner shave.</li>
      <li>how much i save using the replaceable blades over conversional razors.</li>
      <li>Safety razors only require the right double-edged blade.</li>
      <li>Shaves closer than most cheaply made, expensive disposable razors, and at a fraction of the cost.</li>
      <li>I rated this safety razor a 4 because the handle is a little short, but it is good for what I previously described.</li>
      <li>it looks just like the WEISHI and is nowhere near the same Quality!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> This razor is a great razor for the first time users of DE shaving,   well built, solid construction, nice movement of parts and blades are well centered when inserted in the razor its self,      HOWEVER     This will not give me a close shave no matter how well I try, I have a fairly course beard and somewhat heavy growth, but while it doesn&#x27;t allow me a close shave, I also have no razor burn at all.     I prefer the Parker Safety Razor - 91R for shaving nice close shave, way more aggressive than this Weishi, both however are fine razors.    All that being said, I am still on the hunt for a better razor, for my comfort and style of shaving.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. I couldn&#x27;t believe how nice it works and how much i save using the replaceable blades over conversional razors.</li>
    <li> Do not get the butterfly safety razors.  They will rust and you will have to use pliers to spin the razor to open the flaps.  I&#x27;ve been doing that for the past 3 weeks, but now it is broken.  The bottom just spins freely.  I was turning it the right way and it was opening up, but it was rusted so bad that somehow it broke from the inside.  I&#x27;m going to get the top spin one instead.  Not sure how it could get rusted when they are stainless.</li>
    <li> 1 week ago, i was shaving with a Gilette Mach 3, and i had pretty much accepted that i was gonna have to settle for a mediocre shave. my face burned so bad after shaving and i always had a horrible case of razor bumps for about 2-3 days afterward. then, i saw this razor. thinking \\&quot;i haven&#x27;t got anything to lose\\&quot; i ordered it and as soon as it had arrived, i shaved. Oh. My. God. i have a couple of reasons for this.    1. It&#x27;s smooth!    this razor gives one of the smoothest shaves i&#x27;ve ever felt. nuff&#x27; said.    2. it&#x27;s heavy!    you don&#x27;t put pressure on safety razors or you&#x27;ll never get as good of a shave as you could get. instead, just let the weight of the blade rest on your skin. naturally, a heavy razor makes for an easier shave. this razor has some heft to it, and that is one thing you want in a razor.    if you are sick of a mediocre shave, toss your s***ty cartridge razor and get this razor. you&#x27;ll also save some money not having to buy super expensive cartridges anymore.</li>
    <li> If you want a good starter safety-razor or a back-up travel Safety-razor, this is the one to have. I am biased against cartridge razors. The cartridges are overpriced and you don&#x27;t get a good shave like you would with a double edge safety razor. Safety razors only require the right double-edged blade. I use Wilkinson blades which are fantastic. Do not use those drug store double edge blades. You&#x27;ll thank me for this tip. I rated this safety razor a 4 because the handle is a little short, but it is good for what I previously described.</li>
    <li> This razor is very smooth, and the blades last a long time, just keep them clean. Better than multi blades</li>
    <li> Good weight, all the parts are well made. Gives me a great shave so what more could you want?</li>
    <li> Great razor and I save money reminds me of years ago when I first started shaving I highly recommend this razor</li>
    <li> Not a bad safety razor to start with.  It&#x27;s not the best quality construction but it gets the job done.  I&#x27;ve moved on to a better one since purchasing this.</li>
    <li> Always used disposables before. Bought this along with the Proraso Sandalwood soap and the Escali brush. Very nice razor. I can understand what some of the other reviews meant by the weight being beneficial. Very pleased with everything.</li>
    <li> Awesome razor!!! Heavy duty, easy to clean, very close shave with this. I reccomend this item for anyone wanting a safety razor</li>
    <li> Its no secret that a i love the WEISHI Double Edge Safety Razors! This one completes my WEISHI razor collection!!!  If you have a moderate to light beard, this may be the razor for you! Make sure you find the right brand razor blade for your face, i think you will be happy with this razor. Also! Beware, of the look alike razor that goes by the brand name of \\&quot; NANJIE \\&quot; it looks just like the WEISHI and is nowhere near the same Quality!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For a great shave, learn the proper technic for wet shaving and get rid of the plastic-fantastic garbage razors that they have been telling you to buy all of these years!!!  Google  ( How to wet shave? ) and learn how to do it right, for the best shave of your life!! Thanks!!  From the self proclaimed, BIGGEST WEISHI FAN EVER!!!  ERIC</li>
    <li> After paying a fortune for refills it came to me to try shaving the way my dad did. It gives such a close shave, you need to go very slow and be careful. But it has replaced me having to use two different electric razors and then the expensive disposable ones for one shave! And it still wasn&#x27;t as close as one pass with the Weishi double edged razor.</li>
    <li> Great razor.  Careful one must learn to use it while your face learns to get used to it.</li>
    <li> Nice razor. Heavy and feels balanced.  Shaves fine.  will never go back to cheap plastic multi blade razors. I actually enjoy shaving now.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s taking some getting used to, but I like it.  The handle feels a little small in my average hand, for a 6-footer. I&#x27;ve noticed that one side shaves a little closer than the other. Not a big deal, just an observation. I would recommend this as a good starter kit.</li>
    <li> I found this double edge safety razor to be well made and very user friendly to the point exactly what I was looking for a good shave at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Safety razors are great step up from multi-blade razors. I get a much closer, cleaner shave.</li>
    <li> I love it! Shaves closer than most cheaply made, expensive disposable razors, and at a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> Reportedly works well and is economical and effective.</li>
    <li> I gave it 5 start its exactly like the picture said.</li>
    <li> Nice and light, really easy to grip (MUCH better than the Edwin Jagger) and the butterfly mechanism is a lot nicer to use. Only drawback: the handle should be an inch longer.</li>
