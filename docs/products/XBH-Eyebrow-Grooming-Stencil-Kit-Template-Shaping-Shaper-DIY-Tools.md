      <li>Many styles from which to choose.  </li>
      <li>The video is more of an unboxing to show the product up close and share my opinions.</li>
      <li>Make sure you have them in place, where your brow should be, or you will be redoing them.</li>
      <li>If you are already good at using eyebrow stencils or have tried them before with success, you should have no problem with these.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen because it includes so many choices in size.</li>
      <li>Pretty good product.</li>
      <li>I do better free- hand.  </li>
      <li>Many of them don&#x27;t fit my face shape</li>
      <li>It is so easy to use.</li>
      <li>Easy to use when applying make-up.</li>
      <li>Not as easy as to use as I thought they would be.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m cheap, so I persisted w/</li>
      <li>Helps outlining my light eyebrows</li>
      <li>Although I found only one I like to use for my brows, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re a flexible plastic which seems more durable than my old kind that were thinner and got cracked at the edges.</li>
      <li>The good news is that you get MANY different types of styles.</li>
      <li>My right eyebrow came out beautifully, but the left one was a disaster.</li>
      <li>This is not what it is billed to be, they are not 24 unique designs.</li>
      <li>I had to go out &amp; buy a brow pencil &amp; learn how to fill in the uneven parts that didn&#x27;t match the perfectly plucked right brow.</li>
      <li>Would recommend for everyone especially those who have just started their own &#x27;browing&#x27;....Highly recommend both product and seller.</li>
      <li>Has like 5 packages of the same 5 stencils in each so was nice to give some to family</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s my own personal experience.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I guess I didn&#x27;t read it, but it was a nice surprise to see there are 5 packs of stencils and about 4 different stencils in each.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re a pretty firm, flexible plastic, easy to hold against the browbone without it moving around, but also easy to clean with a wipe.</li>
      <li>This was my first time using a stencil and it worked well.</li>
      <li>the white liner, plucking, &amp; filling in my mistakes until I got better @</li>
      <li>I figure I&#x27;ll say that first.</li>
      <li>So overall I am so pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>these have  so many different sizes and shapes that anybody should be able to find several they can use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll admit it took me a while to figure out why some stencils were bigger than others, and that is because you can use the bottom curve over your eyebrow to fill in better without going &amp;#34;out of bounds.&amp;#34; Overall, I&#x27;m really pleased.</li>
      <li>Thanks for taking the time to read my review!</li>
      <li>I love the mutiple shape difference this product provides and the fact that it pretty much provides how to instructions on each individual stencil.</li>
      <li>They are ok but pretty much the same style.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to get the same chape in my eyebrows and now thanks to this stencils</li>
      <li>and I am VERY particular about my eyebrows.</li>
      <li>Easy to do and different styles to change your look.</li>
      <li>Helps immensely with accurate creation of eye brow shapes.</li>
      <li>Very so leased with this product</li>
      <li>much to my chagrin</li>
      <li>Even though I won&#x27;t be using the other stencils, I am still satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>but it really takes practice and a steady hand.</li>
      <li>It has so many different shapes of stencils that you will definitely find one matching for your eyebrows.</li>
      <li>most are much too large for a small face.</li>
      <li>i think these give a more natural look than any other  stencil kit ive used.</li>
      <li>and I think I would have a hard time using any stencil on my own face.</li>
      <li>Made only for very large eyebrows.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use, but was missing one stencil  (a1 from pack I).</li>
      <li>I try to provide you with simple reviews that get straight to the point without a lot of jargon or repeating the product description.</li>
      <li>TO LOOK AT THE NUMBERS ON THE STENCIL TO SEE THIS, THEY ARE CLEARLY MARKED .</li>
      <li>ALL THE STENCILS ARE MARKED</li>
      <li>the plastic they are made of is very stiff and cracks easily.</li>
      <li>This one costs about the same and it had a few that fit my face.</li>
      <li>most stencils come in 4 shapes and they are all very thick.</li>
      <li>I have short eyebrows, and found only three stencils that are the length of filling in my eyebrows in a way that would look natural for me.</li>
      <li>Now, if you are in drama or skits...this little tool would be very valuable!</li>
      <li>if you do happen to already have thick full brows.</li>
      <li>I like them a lot because i can have several different shapes that all look fairly natural and not super thick like most stencils.</li>
      <li>as mentioned already, its worth it to spend the money that is usually charged for just four stencils to have several different looks that you can use even if you have to throw some out or give them away.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s very minor, so</li>

<li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as expected and</li>
<li> These came sooner than expected and offered a wide variety of eyebrow design stencils..</li>
<li> Total waste of money.</li>
<li> It arrived before it was expected, I have got in a week.</li>
<li> it is stencils,not what i expected</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used other eyebrow stencils that come in a 4-pack</li>
<li> I have purchased before only four different stencils and none of them matched my eyebrows, but now with 24 different styles you can not go wrong.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s just hard to hold it on your face and apply pencil or powder at the same time.</li>
<li> not worth the money...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my face. Very awkward to try to use. Waste of money</li>
    <li> These stencils are made of a heavy flexable plastic. You will get a lot of use out of them.  As for my face shape, I had a hard time finding the right one for me.  The shape I liked was too large for my face.  Now, if you are in drama or skits...this little tool would be very valuable! It is hard to get eyebrows to match on both sides.  We will be using these during our plays and drama&#x27;s at church. Just not what I needed for my face size.  There are 24 shapes to choose from.  I&#x27;m just not brave enough to go so large with my eyebrows.  Instructions aren&#x27;t included. I guess it&#x27;s a no-brainer but there are lines on them for line up.</li>
    <li> Not as easy as to use as I thought they would be.</li>
    <li> They are ok but pretty much the same style.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t get the stencils even from eye to eye. waste.</li>
    <li> Would recommend a stencil to anyone that regularly pencils eyebrows.  I have very thin brows and use a pencil daily. There are many different shapes to try,  a lot of them unable to use bc they are for really big eyebrows.</li>
    <li> This sucks it does not work at all ! Waste of money !!</li>
    <li> so many choices! with amazon prime i recieved it in two days! eyebrow game stays on point everyday now.</li>
    <li> Best eyebrow stencils I&#x27;ve seen because it includes so many choices in size. I&#x27;ve had the set that only has 4 stencils and it&#x27;s worthless because non of the four fit. This one costs about the same and it had a few that fit my face. I&#x27;m a male drag queen, so you know. The questions regarding color and and application don&#x27;t apply. This kit is only the stencils, no brow powders, brushes, pencils or cosmetics are included. Also I&#x27;ve seen questions about if they are adhesive, they are not. You hold them onto the face and draw your brow or use a brow powder through the stencil to help you shape your brow. They can also be used to draw the shape and then pluck the hair you don&#x27;t want. Good product and shipped quickly using Prime shipping..</li>
    <li> The stencils dont come with a wax or powder, just 24 stencils as described. most stencils come in 4 shapes and they are all very thick. these have  so many different sizes and shapes that anybody should be able to find several they can use. I found about 7 and one stencil matched my brows perfectly.  I like them a lot because i can have several different shapes that all look fairly natural and not super thick like most stencils. there are however thick stencils included as well if you do happen to already have thick full brows. i think these give a more natural look than any other  stencil kit ive used. as mentioned already, its worth it to spend the money that is usually charged for just four stencils to have several different looks that you can use even if you have to throw some out or give them away.</li>
    <li> Good product but it really takes practice and a steady hand.</li>
    <li> Although I found only one I like to use for my brows, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> I love them! I wasn&#x27;t able to get the same chape in my eyebrows and now thanks to this stencils my eyebrows looks great!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very so leased with this product</li>
    <li> These were absolutely terrible. I do not recommend these and regret buying them. They are 24 styles of bull s***.</li>
    <li> The stencils are way to big. There were only two that were on the slimmer side but I like my eyebrows really thin. Just not for me.</li>
    <li> not worth the money...</li>
    <li> Helps outlining my light eyebrows it&#x27;s just hard to hold it on your face and apply pencil or powder at the same time. Has like 5 packages of the same 5 stencils in each so was nice to give some to family</li>
    <li> These stencils are a little bit tricky because I followed another commenter&#x27;s advice and bought a white eye liner pencil to trace the shape of the stencil &amp; pluck the area outside of the white line. So, I use the stencils for shaping &amp; not for filling in w/ a brow pencil or powder. My right eyebrow came out beautifully, but the left one was a disaster. I had to go out &amp; buy a brow pencil &amp; learn how to fill in the uneven parts that didn&#x27;t match the perfectly plucked right brow. The up side is that I learned how the brow shape that I prefer works &amp; how to resist over-plucking. I&#x27;m cheap, so I persisted w/the white liner, plucking, &amp; filling in my mistakes until I got better @ all three. My brows look very good despite my learning curve &amp; I save money because brow pencils &amp; tweezers can be purchased @ the Dollar Store &amp; are cheaper than going to a salon. I would recommend this product for the way I use it only if you have patience &amp; aren&#x27;t afraid to make mistakes. Read the other reviews to get a sense of how this product works for its actual intended purpose, though.</li>
    <li> These are Def not worth ordering.</li>
    <li> ALL THE STENCILS ARE MARKED AND THEY ARE ALL DIFFERENT . ONE HA TO LOOK AT THE NUMBERS ON THE STENCIL TO SEE THIS, THEY ARE CLEARLY MARKED . GREAT PRICE AND GREAT TO ADD TO MY FREELANCE KIT</li>
    <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t read it, but it was a nice surprise to see there are 5 packs of stencils and about 4 different stencils in each. This was my first time using a stencil and it worked well.</li>
    <li> I love it. It is so easy to use.</li>
    <li> This was shipped from China so the brow shapes are a little off.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work like I had hoped</li>
    <li> Cant hold these stencils and apply liner at the same time.  And way too many stencils.  Will never use this.  Total waste of money. I do better free- hand.  Nothing is written in English (just Chinese)so maybe there is a method, but I cant tell.</li>
    <li> Although a  lot of stencils... most are much too large for a small face. Didn&#x27;t work as well as expected and the plastic they are made of is very stiff and cracks easily. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:1b4e424a9c8bcc561e85cac053b61b0a]] This is not what it is billed to be, they are not 24 unique designs. This is 6 packs of the same designs. Beyond disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the video to see the product up close and personal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** I try to provide you with simple reviews that get straight to the point without a lot of jargon or repeating the product description. The video is more of an unboxing to show the product up close and share my opinions. I hope this look at the products has helped you make the decision to buy or not to buy. Thanks for taking the time to read my review! ***</li>
    <li> this was not color it is stencils,not what i expected</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving five stars, though there is one little bummer. It&#x27;s very minor, so I figure I&#x27;ll say that first. These are for long eyebrows. Or probably average. I have short eyebrows, and found only three stencils that are the length of filling in my eyebrows in a way that would look natural for me. But I know my eyebrows are not on &amp;#34;fleek,&amp;#34; lol. So, it&#x27;s probably perfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt;They are all different, and 24 count. I&#x27;ll admit it took me a while to figure out why some stencils were bigger than others, and that is because you can use the bottom curve over your eyebrow to fill in better without going &amp;#34;out of bounds.&amp;#34; Overall, I&#x27;m really pleased. They&#x27;re a pretty firm, flexible plastic, easy to hold against the browbone without it moving around, but also easy to clean with a wipe. It also came here earlier than expected. c:</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other eyebrow stencils that come in a 4-pack but they were always wider and thicker than my brows.  I got this pack of 24 styles and picked out the 4-5 shapes that match my brow shape perfectly.  I can&#x27;t seem to fill in my brows freehand so I use these everyday; the $8 cost was worth it to basically keep 5 and throw out the other 15.  They&#x27;re a flexible plastic which seems more durable than my old kind that were thinner and got cracked at the edges.</li>
    <li> I like these stencils. They come with a ton of different shapes/styles that you can try. Not all of them will fit your face or your desired shape but the ones that do are good. I found them difficult to use but just as difficult as any other eyebrow stencil would be. If you are already good at using eyebrow stencils or have tried them before with success, you should have no problem with these. I am unexperienced with stencils and I think I would have a hard time using any stencil on my own face.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny. Easy to do and different styles to change your look.</li>
    <li> These came sooner than expected and offered a wide variety of eyebrow design stencils.. much to my chagrin, I realized I didn&#x27;t have enough eyebrows to even draw them on Ha-Ha!</li>
    <li> These are great stencils and save a TON of time for me and I am VERY particular about my eyebrows. Would recommend for everyone especially those who have just started their own &#x27;browing&#x27;....Highly recommend both product and seller.</li>
    <li> I love the mutiple shape difference this product provides and the fact that it pretty much provides how to instructions on each individual stencil.</li>
    <li> These will help you create the perfect eyebrows. Many of them don&#x27;t fit my face shape but it&#x27;s nice to have a selection of sizes and shapes.</li>
    <li> Pretty good product. Make sure you have them in place, where your brow should be, or you will be redoing them.</li>
    <li> These are fat and cartoon like..</li>
    <li> The good news is that you get MANY different types of styles. The bad part is that these are very hard to use...but that&#x27;s my own personal experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this took a very long time to arrive.</li>
    <li> Many styles from which to choose.  Easy to use when applying make-up.</li>
    <li> Of the 24 styles, only two stood out for me, but they both work for my eyebrow shape. Even though I won&#x27;t be using the other stencils, I am still satisfied with the product. It&#x27;s hard to find eyebrow stencils that actually take into account real eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, but was missing one stencil  (a1 from pack I).</li>
    <li> Helps immensely with accurate creation of eye brow shapes.</li>
    <li> It arrived before it was expected, I have got in a week. It has so many different shapes of stencils that you will definitely find one matching for your eyebrows. So overall I am so pleased with this product. I have purchased before only four different stencils and none of them matched my eyebrows, but now with 24 different styles you can not go wrong.</li>
    <li> Not happy. The 24 styleys were almost the same need to add some little thinker and shorter ones..</li>
    <li> I did not like 1 style.  Made only for very large eyebrows.  Poor quality.</li>
