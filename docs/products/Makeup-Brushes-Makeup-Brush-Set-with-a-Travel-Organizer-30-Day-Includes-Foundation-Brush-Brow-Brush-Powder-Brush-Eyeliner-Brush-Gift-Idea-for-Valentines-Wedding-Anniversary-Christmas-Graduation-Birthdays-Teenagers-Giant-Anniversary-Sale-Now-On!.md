<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge makeup fan and am always looking for new brushes to add to my collection. I love that this set has all the brushes you could possibly need for powder, highlighting, lips, eyes, contouring etc. The fact that it&#x27;s in its own case helps keep everything together beautifully. The bristles are soft and holds up well and didn&#x27;t fall out like a lot of other brushes do. The sleek matte handles look so professional and fits comfortably in your hand. If you&#x27;re someone who loves to use makeup like I do, this is a great set to have at your fingertips.</li>
    <li> I found my new makeup brushes waiting for me when I returned from our vacation. You know, when you order something online, you don&#x27;t can&#x27;t always be  sure what you are going to get,and I am happy to report that this set of makeup brushes is a winner !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the box, I could see that it was carefully packaged and the pouch with the brushes inside were protected by those small air filled packing aids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pouch is a very soft vinyl with a closure wrap and inside of the package, the brushes are all individually packaged in plastic sleeves.&lt;br /&gt;OK, it looked good..now the real test...I tugged on the bristles to test their viability and they are in tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next real test....I used 4 of the brushes and when I washed them, they actually came clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used (and discarded) many of the very best in cosmetic brushes and these brushes stand up against some of the most pricey brand names out there&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, IMHO...Go for it!</li>
    <li> Good set for the price. The foundation brush works great, but the stippling brush sheds horribly. I washed the brushes before using them as recommended and laid them flat to dry. The brushes with black bristles had a black residue wash off when I washed them. Other than that they are ok.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The makeup brushes are great quality and it comes with handy leather pouch which you can carry everywhere, perfect for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s incredibly soft and gentle on your skin which will make you feel good and look good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the selection of brushes in the package as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have to say the Quality of the brushes is Fantastic, they stay together and don&#x27;t lose anything at all when you use them, and that in itself is definately a major plus in my book!</li>
    <li> They are wonderful great quality and if your thinking of buying then, JUST DO IT! You will not regret buying them ladies</li>
    <li> I really only ordered this brush set for the stippling brush and the pencil brush, but I was pleasantly pleased with the overall quality. This brush is great for a minimalist, for traveling, or a beginner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set comes with 12 brushes and a case. It will stink horribly at first, but that was easily fixed by washing the case and brushes and letting them dry overnight. I should note that some of the brushes are real hair, synthetic or a mix, so i advise to be very very careful with washing (&amp; the olive oil + antibacteria soap is probably not a good option for these). Some brushes will require a double wash to get rid of the smell, but once they&#x27;re completely dry, you can&#x27;t really smell the factory smell any longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, all the face brushes are very soft, but not very dense (which can be good or bad, depending on what you aim to get). On the other hand, most of the eye brushes are harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Large Powder Brush -- this is HUGE. It&#x27;s very fluffy, but not densely packed. Thus, its GREAT FOR APPLYING FINISHING POWDER lightly to not disturb your foundation. It&#x27;s also great for sweeping off excess powder, highlight, and blush. However, I feel that this brush is not dense enough for applying powder foundation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Stippling Brush -- Good amount of hair, but not very dense. I tried it with my BB cream today and it almost ate it up, but I kind of expected that. I think this would be GREAT FOR LIQUID &amp; CREAM FOUNDATION, AND CREAM BLUSHES. It&#x27;s very soft and has a great distribution of duo fibers for stippling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Contour/medium powder brush? -- again, really soft, but not densely packed. The softness if in between my ecotools (softest)and my mac 109 (not as soft as I&#x27;d like). It kind of resembles a mac 109, except more flat and is surprisingly great for contouring. Because it&#x27;s not so dense, it is a bit hard to control, but it doesn&#x27;t apply too much bronzer either, making it much easier to blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Angled Blush brush -- I&#x27;ve been eyeing the Nars Yachiyo brush for way too long and this brush gives me a VERY similar effect. This brush is great if you are heavy handed or are using a pigmented blush. Because it&#x27;s not too dense, it picks up less product and gives a more natural look. As much as I love my ecotools blush brush because it&#x27;s the softest brush (it feels like unicorn hair caressing your face), it&#x27;s easy to overdo blush, but this brush makes it easier to build your blush. I surprisingly love this brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Foundation brush -- really soft and dense. I don&#x27;t really use traditional foundation brushes, but this is soft and probably the best of the set for dry or sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Pencil brush -- I really really wanted to love this brush, but it was quite disappointing. The bristles are goat hair but are too harsh and rough for blending or smudging. The shape and size is really beautiful so I&#x27;m going to try washing with baby shampoo to soften it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Blending brush -- this brush is not dense enough for applying eye shadow all over your lid and does a decent job at blending, but I find it kind of useless. It works pretty well at applying contour color if you want a more angled or chiseled look&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Eye shadow brush -- okay, but not the greatest. It picks up color decently and it doesn&#x27;t absorb all your eye shadow, but it requires extra effort to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. Eye brow brush -- I LOVE this brush. its the perfect size and density to fill in your brows. Prior to this, I&#x27;ve been using an angled eyeliner brush that was a wee bit too long. This really helps get the precise shape that I need. I think this might also work for applying eyeliner better than the eyeliner brush that came with it; it&#x27;s soft and stiff, but not too stiff that it would irritate your eyes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. Eyeliner brush -- not stiff nor dense enough, making it hard to control. I found it hard to line my upper lashes, but much easier to line my lower lash line. However, because I don&#x27;t usually line my lower lash line, I don&#x27;t find it that useful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11. Tapered blending brush -- this brush is huge and good for applying shadow to the crease. I find that it doesn&#x27;t pick up enough eye shadow sometimes and is too rough for blending. I actually think my $1 elf crease brushes are softer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like most of the brushes, but I wish some were more dense. Some of the brushes are hits and some are misses, but it all depends on what look you are going for. I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> The brush set was everything we wanted.  Wish there was a guide to what each brush is used for, that would be helpful.  the seller has been wonderful with her ongoing e mails on how to care for the brushes properly.  Very, excellent service, indeed!</li>
    <li> These brushes are absolutely fantastic.  Excellent quality so therefore putting on my makeup is much easier and much more precise.</li>
    <li> Nice long lasting brushes, so soft and smooth when you apply it. I think this was the best investment i made</li>
    <li> These brushes were a Valentine&#x27;s Day gift for my 16 yo daughter. She is quite fussy about her makeup and brushes. I was afraid this set might not make the A-list. She is delighted with the set and the case to store them in. Came just in time for her high school musical  dress rehearsal.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1) Lots of different brushes!&lt;br /&gt;2) Cute leather case to use if you&#x27;re traveling&lt;br /&gt;3) I really like the eye makeup brushes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1) You definitely get what you pay judging by the quality of the product, I may have to get replacements in about a year.&lt;br /&gt;2) The bristles are soft but have fallen out a few times when I have applied my makeup.</li>
    <li> I love this brush set. I am a Professional Make-Up Artist, and this brush set has all the necessary brushes for a prefessional make-up. They are quality brushes, and they´re beautiful. I ordered 6 brushes set, and then I ordered 3 more. They´re all that I want and need it.</li>
    <li> the brushes for the eyeshadow are great, the brushes for foundation and blushes are terrible. the stippling brush is the worst, it does not blend well and the hairs fall out.</li>
    <li> this brush set is awful!! the hairs startd to fall as soon as i got them out the kit. never again will i buy these.</li>
    <li> These brushes starting shredding since the first time i washed them, my elf brushes are better quality than this brushes, dont wasye your money</li>
    <li> Quality make-up brushes.  My only wish is that they were marked as to which brush is for which since I am a make-up novice.  Most people would already know this, but I&#x27;m going to have to ask one of my friends.  But the brushes are good quality and the case travels well with them in it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty decent for the price! Im not very good to judge because those are my first set ever, so I can&#x27;t compare with other brands! Still a beginner! And that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t wanna spend hundreds! But in my opinion, is very good! Still practicing!</li>
    <li> I am not experienced with make up brushes, at all. When I saw this set being sold for the affordable price on Amazon, I reviewed all the comments and decided that this would be a good deal. The price was right for the array of brushes offered. As stated in many reviews, there was a slight smell from the brushes to begin with. I cleaned them like advised and started using these tools. The brushes are soft with a great handle that allows an ease of use. Only the white slanted brush, I believe it&#x27;s the contour one, losses it&#x27;s hair. I wish I could provide a more thorough knowledge review, but I am a beginner at brushes. I can honestly stated, &amp;#34;So Far, So Good.&amp;#34; These tools are doing what they are meant to accomplish. I am having fun putting on eye shadow then blending to create the look I want. Overall, this is a good starter kit.</li>
    <li> This brush set is the best I have ever had. All the brushes are really good quality. I would definitely recommend this set! You wont regret this purchase!</li>
    <li> average quality brushes..worth the price on sale..but will not recommend it to others..brushes for eyes do not work at all</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this brush set at first, but now I love it! At first it did have a funny smell but I just openedit up and let it air out overnight and that did the trick.</li>
    <li> According to my girlfriends these are amazing brushes. The way they apply the make comes out evenly. My girlfriends loves them!</li>
    <li> no shedding, soft, easy to  use and clean. I also like the fact it is stored in a nice carrying case to use when i travel.</li>
    <li> Initially my wife was very impressed by the quality and overall performance of these brushes. However after regular use several of the (most often used ) brushes began to shed a significant amount of the head density into her makeup and onto her skin. VERY AGGRAVATING. Miqqi sent a replacement for 1 of the faulty brushes. It too began to shed a few short weeks after arrival. Despite the initial glowing review I wanted to give these brushes, they aren&#x27;t as durable as the higher priced premium brands. I guess this is just another case of &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Kay,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the follow up email and for the helpful tips! I am impressed you would take the time to follow up. I feel it says a lot about you and the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am new to using makeup brushes. I have yet to learn about what each brush is specifically used for and how it truly enhances ones makeup...?&lt;br /&gt;I will use the card that came inside the case and hope it offers me insight and education on the great makeup brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again.</li>
    <li> These appeared to be very nice brushes when I first received them.  There are plenty of them, the bristles are soft and I like the nice travel organizer.  I received them in a timely manner and the seller followed up with a friendly email providing tips for caring for the brushes.  However, over time the brushes started to shed A LOT.  Each time I use the brushes I have to clean bristles off of my face, and hope I haven&#x27;t left any behind which would be embarrassing.  The seller is clearly very friendly and professional.  I&#x27;ve noticed they try to make things right with the buyer and offer a 30-day guarantee.  Hopefully, they&#x27;ll improve on these and try again.</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  They are for our daughter.  We wanted to get real hair instead of synthectic and that is why we picked your brush set.  She is very happy with them..</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price. Love these brushes!</li>
    <li> I ordered my brushes and within less than a few days they arrived! I opened the box to inhale a chemical like smell. It was sort of obnoxious. I have not got the chance to use them yet. So far they appear like great brushes. And so soft! I wish a pamphlet would have been included to go into detail for each brush and it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
    <li> about 3 of them were shedding . but i bought these brushes around christmas 2013 &amp; its july 20 2014 &amp; still using some of the brushes .</li>
    <li> Love this brush set, the only thing is that when I opened the package, it smelled a bit.  I&#x27;m sure the smell will go away.  I would definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Very soft &amp; great quality for what I paid!! So in love! I was pleasantly surprised with them. So great.</li>
    <li> Bought this set as a gift for my wife and she loves them! She says she especially loves the foundation brush and the eye brow brush. Seller was really thoughtful with follow up emails to ensure we got our brushes and also provided useful first use tips. Definitely a plus in my department!</li>
    <li> wife think these are great</li>
    <li> These brushes are good but not great.  Some of them shed....the stippling brush especially! All in all they work ok for an amateur like me.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t thinks these are with the money. The shed a lot and some.of the brushes are extremely hard. Yes they say MAC but they aren&#x27;t the same qualified.  Take the time and buy good brushes one at a time if you have too. This short cut dogs pan out.</li>
    <li> These brushes were wonderful!  Very happy with this product and timing of delivery.</li>
    <li> These brushes immediately changed the way my makeup looked on my face. My husband noticed the difference immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company sends you updates about the brushes and how to care for them. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with them. They were extremely reasonable in price and very good quality. They don&#x27;t shed and makeup applies flawlessly.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush set . Perfect for applying makeup . Love the brissels very soft to touch . Haven&#x27;t had any fallout yet .</li>
    <li> The eye shadow brushes are okay, but the face brushes are terrible.  I washed them with the hope that the shedding would stop, but they are just poorly made.</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes to upgrade from the ELF brushes I had bought at Target.  I figured since I had bought some nicer makeup (Naked 2 palate and Bare Minerals foundation) that I should invest in some nicer brushes.  These weren&#x27;t the answer I was hoping for.  The eyeshadow brushes are stiff and don&#x27;t apply makeup well.  The foundation brushes shed.  I got the brushes as soon as they arrived, they still shed.  I honestly have thought about using the return policy and returning them to get some actually nice brushes.  If this is a starter set, go for it.  Otherwise, stay away.</li>
    <li> MY BEST PURCHASE EVER ON AMAZON. I was a Beauty consultant when there was only a&lt;br /&gt;Top 8 Brands &amp; used sets worth hundreds. THESE ARE BETTER.Shipped fast &amp; my&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;can&#x27;t be pleased friend\\&quot; thanked me for the BEST gift she&#x27;s ever gotten.The&lt;br /&gt;case is just as INCREDIBLE ! These could easily sell in the $300-$400 price&lt;br /&gt;range &amp; true pros wouldn&#x27;t bat an eye.They WILL last.THANK YOU FOR AN AMAZING&lt;br /&gt;SET I LOVE!</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price and I absolutely love the carrying case. These brushes are so soft and feel great against your skin. Must have for the price and a girl can never have too many brushes!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s such a long title.. But I AM IN LOVE WITH THESE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, they arrived on time and in perfect shape, all individually wrapped. They didn&#x27;t smell too weird when I first unpacked them, but I washed them anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are very soft and only a few shed- but I&#x27;ll do mini reviews of all the brushes later. It comes with pretty much every brush that a beginner needs or great brushes to expand your collection. This set has a variety of both face and eye brushes, as shown in the pictures, which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MINI REVIEWS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bigger blush/powder brush- Not the softest or fluffiest I own, but it does the job. I don&#x27;t use it much because it tends to shed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smaller blush/powder brush- Same as above, just smaller. Still sheds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stippling (duo fiber) brush- LOVE THIS. One of my favorites. It&#x27;s super soft, unlike some of my stippling brushes which tend to poke my face. I love this! EXCEPT- it sheds! Which kind of sucks, but I still love and use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angled blush brush- Sort of scratchy, but not too bad. It was a little frayed at the edges when I took the wrapper off. This one sheds the most out of all the brushes, which is a shame, because it&#x27;s a great size and you can always tell when it&#x27;s dirty. (comes in handy when you&#x27;re washing your brushes- on black bristles you can&#x27;t really tell if they&#x27;re completely clean)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fine liner brush- I don&#x27;t use these types of brushes, even for gel liner, but I tried it out for the sake of this review and I actually like it (though I doubt I&#x27;ll use it much). It doesn&#x27;t shed and makes a pretty precise line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angled [liner] brush- I LOVE THIS. MY FAVORITE OF THE BUNCH. I used to have really sparse brows, and this was great for filling them in, as well as liner (shadow or cream). It&#x27;s the perfect stiffness and width. I&#x27;m in love with this. I wish I could buy another one separately!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Pointed] crease brush- Great for outer-V work and blending in the crease. I&#x27;ve also used it for a cut crease, and it worked nicely. Soft and doesn&#x27;t shed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fluffy blending brush (white) - SECOND FAVORITE, LOVE LOVE LOVE. This is very similar to the MAC 217 (in my opinion). I love this for either a wash of color everywhere (like a neutral brown for crease and lid for a nice simple look) or crease work. Absolutely love this. Perfect brush that everyone needs to have in their collection. So versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fluffy blending brush (black)- This was a little bigger than I expected. It&#x27;s not super soft, but it doesn&#x27;t shed. I like to use it to set my under eyes with a loose powder. If you have larger eyes or really want to blend edges, this works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flat foundation brush- I don&#x27;t like these kinds of brushes because they tend to streak (and I don&#x27;t wear foundation regularly). But this one doesn&#x27;t streak, is super soft, and doesn&#x27;t shed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flat shader- This a pretty stiff brush, nice for packing on color. Pretty average, but soft, not too stiff, and doesn&#x27;t shed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope I helped!! (and that this wasn&#x27;t too long) :)blending in the crease.

    <li> These would cost a fortune at a cosmetic counter.  Very nice quality, nice assortment, the carrying case is also high quality</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get the brushes but after the first use the stippling brush started to shed really badly. After the second use the powder brush started to shed really badly. From there it was down hilll</li>
    <li> A really nice quality set of inexpensive synthetic brushes. The set comes with everything you need for eyes, eyebrows, cheeks, loose powder and more. The brushes clean well and retain their soft structure.</li>
    <li> I like how there&#x27;s quite a few brushes tinplate around with.  I just didn&#x27;t appreciate the hairs falling out each time I used it. But after washing it with shampoo and water,  it stopped falling out,  and was so soft(:</li>
    <li> I bought these makeup brushes for a gift to my sister-in-law.  She opened them today with my 4 sisters present and everyone was really impressed with the quality and the nice case they were in.  They all want the same brushes for their own birthdays.  I also asked for them for my birthday.  They are a great value for the price and I would highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> These brushes are a great value for the price. They are very soft, softer than expected. The travel case is nice too for keeping brushes organized and clean. I gave these brushes a four only because the case feels like a thinner vinyl. I was happy with what I got and would buy them again.</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes not really knowing what I would be getting.  Some people seemed to love them and some did not.  I was very surprised and happy when I opened the package.  I love them!  They are in a very nice black case that will be great for travel.  Someone mentioned that they smelled horrible upon opening, but I did not notice any odor at all--much less a bad one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, I can tell you that I use makeup brushes everyday and I&#x27;ve bought plenty of them from very expensive to &amp;#34;less expensive&amp;#34;.  I use a foundation brush, eyebrow brush, eye shadow brush, blending brush, powder brush, etc.  These brushes are wonderful.  For the price I paid, they are outstanding.  I&#x27;ve paid as much for one brush in the past as I did for all of these.  Of course, one expects new brushes to shed a bit, but I honestly have not found them to shed much, if any, at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very, very pleased that I ordered them.  I think you will be too.  I love them!</li>
    <li> This beautiful brush set came quickly even if we got 6 inches snow. I purchased it after reading the customer reviews. I love it! They performance very well. My makeup appears more precise than before. The powder brush shed a little bit, I guess it&#x27;s natural since it is real hair. I love the foundation brush and stripling brush mostly, they sure do their job!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m borrowing my husband&#x27;s account to write this review because we purchased this on his account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess I am likely the first to review this product. I have always liked trying new products in the market. Naturally, I must say the product images looked appealing to me and what did I have to lose when they offered a no questions asked money back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, down to business. The product came real quick so that was a plus. Delivery was timely. I must say I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the simple packaging but seriously that is the only thing that needs improving (you listening here, miQQi?) Once unpacked, I must say the brushes are absolutely lovely. I have bought branded professional makeup brushes that cost a lot more and these miQQi brushes totally could rival these top brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impressions were excellent. Nice travel pouch, highly useful selection of brush types. The bristles are soft and comfortable. I tried tugging at them and they didn&#x27;t shed at all. I think my favourite in the mix is their stippling brush. I think that alone is worth the full price of the whole package. But that isn&#x27;t to say the other brushes aren&#x27;t good. They all are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad my willingness to try new products worked out this time :) Ok, husband is asking for his time on the computer. Maybe I will come back and follow up on this set of lovely professional makeup brushes. Give them a try, you will love them as much as I do.</li>
    <li> I guess all those great reviews were spot on because when my daughter got them she yelled at me for spending that much money! she then posted on Facebook a pic and said &amp;#34; I have the best dad in the entire world!!!!!!&amp;#34; Those moments are priceless! Anyone that spends &amp;#62;$100 on makeup brushes because they think they have to are drinking the koolaid!</li>
    <li> The bushes smelled real bad, I wash them with mild soap and water, they are ragged looking, I need to return the bushes, the carrying is nice</li>
    <li> I was super happy with this set. The pouch that it came in is awesome. The brushes are soft and apply makeup well.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so nice. I got them for a good price and they are amazing! I did not have any problems with them shedding. Plus the customer service was great as well. Good buy. Would HIGHLY recommend!</li>
    <li> Believe it! These brushes are truly everything promised, and more. The quality is top drawer, the collection is definately professional, and the price is more than reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;Back in the day, I was a professional makeup artist, in San Francisco. I worked for some of the best kown cosmetic houses, Christion Dior, Shiseido, Lancome and others. Generally the company would supply the brushes for us to work with.  Since they wanted their product to sell well, they always had us use excellent brushes. These brushes definately compare. They are as nice as any I have ever used, even some that cost a great deal more. Yes, I love them, and certainly recommend then!</li>
    <li> Great set ! Brushes are great quality!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t love them, I didn&#x27;t hate them. They were okay. For high end brushes, I still prefer MAC and for cheap brushes I prefer elf.</li>
