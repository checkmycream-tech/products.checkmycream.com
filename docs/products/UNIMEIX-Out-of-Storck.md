    <li> They are really soft brushes. I can&#x27;t use them for what I originally wanted them for but my niece is enjoying them.</li>
    <li> These are good makeup brushes. They came in this adorable magenta/purple brush roll. The inside of the brush roll is white with mesh pockets. The brush bristles are synthetic and are a vibrant purple color. The handles are a maroon color. They look great displayed on my vanity.  These brushes are not high end but are well made and can get the job done. I currently have them out on my vanity but because of the brush roll they can be packed up and taken on the go. I recommend this brush set to someone who is just starting out in makeup or to the intermediate person experimenting with different looks. You have a brush for every technique. My only complaint was the strong smell from packaging but it quickly went away after a good washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Beautiful.I totally love it.</li>
    <li> Love love love. It was delivered in just a day and the packaging was great. Quite funny it came in such a big box too. Downside is mine smelt a lot like paint? Wierd i know but it did! Other then the smell i love it there much bigger then i would have expected and they are just super soft as well!</li>
    <li> I will stick to my Mac brushes</li>
    <li> Good looking brushes but doesn&#x27;t hold makeup good , nor does it apply good , I even washed them when i received them and still nothing , wouldn&#x27;t recommended these at all</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s not a surprise that this product has 5 star reviews. I received the package quickly and it was in perfect condition! I love the shiny, purple case and it is so convenient for storage and travel purposes! Everything is clean and the brushes have a plastic covering. The case is a great size to store in a drawer or take up a little space on a desk or shelve. I&#x27;m so excited about this product and I can&#x27;t wait to continue using it! Get this makeup brush set!!!!</li>
    <li> This set of brushes is fantastic but the plastic package it comes in stinks to high heaven....I removed the plastic wrap and washed each individual brush and aired them for a few days</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m doing my sister&#x27;s makeup for her wedding and decided to buy these for her since purple is one of her wedding colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with the mixed reviews, but I&#x27;m happy with the look of the brushes. The carrier itself looks a bit cheap and &amp;#34;foily&amp;#34; for lack of a better word, but she&#x27;s not a bridezilla or sisterzilla (ha), and I know she&#x27;ll like the little touch. Purple brushes for her purple wedding. I&#x27;ll update this if she hates them lol.</li>
