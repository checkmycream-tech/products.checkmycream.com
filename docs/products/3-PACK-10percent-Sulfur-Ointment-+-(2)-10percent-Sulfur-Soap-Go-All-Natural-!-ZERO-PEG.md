      <li>Will buy more when I&#x27;m out.</li>
      <li>I love the sulfur soap.</li>
      <li>The ointment does smell like burnt matches or burned out tire rubber...but a temporary inconvenience for sure.</li>
      <li>I like that it is PEG free also!</li>
      <li>The soap seems very effective so far.  </li>
      <li>The kit was shipped immediately and arrived very quickly in a sturdy carton.</li>
      <li>Scent is noticeable, but not too strong.  </li>
      <li>The ointment is fine and as described</li>
      <li>This soap and ointment have made a huge difference in my acne/rosacea.</li>
      <li>and though there is a light sulfur scent when you sniff the bar, it goes away after rinsing,&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also you can use this soap all over to be odor free all day.  </li>
      <li>I use this if I have a breakout (which is very rare)</li>
      <li>I use a lot of coconut oil and olive oil on my skin after showering my skin feels clean and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I originally purchased this soap to help with my 50 year-old but still acne prone skin (and it seems to be helping, along with the cream, with that)</li>
      <li>I was very surprised that is was effective on my cystic acne.</li>
      <li>I purchased the sulfur ointment along with the sulfur bar, however, the ointment broke my face out even more, very greasy and grainy.</li>
      <li>Never in all my years have I had a product work as quickly as these sulfur treatments do.</li>
      <li>Order arrived quickly and as described.</li>
      <li>Great all round anti microbial soap with miticidal properties.</li>
      <li>These products are cheaper and work for me far better than the &amp;#34;commercial&amp;#34; products on store shelves and prescription items.</li>
      <li>It is a little drying so you will need a good body and face lotion after washing.  </li>
      <li>love simple solutions!</li>
      <li>I used a prescribed medication the first night</li>
      <li>Arrived fast!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always used benzoyl/salyctic acid products and find them largely inneffective.</li>
      <li>It took 2 months for my skin to stop breaking out so much.  </li>
      <li>The difference is really miraculous....</li>
      <li>Works very well on my din&#x27;s pimples.</li>
      <li>This sulfur soap works really well.  </li>
      <li>I started using this about a week ago, I was really skeptical at first because I had been using another sulphur soap and ointment that was working great for my acne and u</li>
      <li>Acnedote I use this every evening on my face chest and back, (this product completely cleared my back and chest in a matter of days) can be found cheap on Amazon!!</li>
      <li>Immediately applied ointment all over my body used Qtip for ears and nostrils light layer on face not near my eyes.</li>
      <li>But still a decent product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>The next morning I could already tell a difference with the blisters on my right hand.  </li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>The spots are still red, but flat and most non hormonal related acne was eradicated.  </li>
      <li>and my skin feels soft as a babys bottom.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also much easier to rub a bar of soap over a dog rather than having to squeeze out multiple dollops of liquid shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and the musty smell was completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I promise if you are an adult with acne this regiment will clear your skin and reduce the redness from acne scars.</li>
      <li>So much more affordable than buying tons of chemicals and overloading your skin with harsh cleansers and creams!!</li>
      <li>The ointment is a little stiff in the jar, not as easy to spread over larger surfaces and seems a little sticky, but it&#x27;s more of a personal preference and this would work just fine for smaller areas.</li>
      <li>This soap has very little fragrance to it, no offensive odor at all, it just smells clean to me.  </li>
      <li>The soap has the same exact sulfur smell of the water in that shower and did not irritate or even dry my skin out.  </li>
      <li>I am a 35 year old female and have had severe acne since the age of 12</li>
      <li>soap makes their fur squeaky clean, which I think means it strips all the natural oils, so I wouldn&#x27;t use it more than once every 14 days or so,  but it works very well at getting rid of nasty smells</li>

<li> and they don&#x27;t smell at all like sulfur when their fur is dry.  </li>

<li> your using is working, don&#x27;t mess up now&amp;#34;!</li>
<li> My only issue is that this soap is expensive.</li>
<li> when my pup rolled in some dead critter (anyone who owns a dog knows how hard it is to get out dead-critter smell!)</li>
<li> I spread it evenly over my entire face, I will warn you that it feels disgusting like Vaseline, I leave it on for 20 to 30 minutes then use the Acnedote scrub to wash it off.</li>
<li> The prescribed medication took away the itching, but I was left with the blisters and the rash on my stomach that continued to itch terribly.  </li>
<li> The smell isn&#x27;t even that bad.</li>
<li> This ointment smells horrible, like really really awful, but it works &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; on my skin!</li>

    <li> Excellent Amazon seller/. Great product.</li>
    <li> I am please I am using all of their products on my dogs, and they stop scratching</li>
    <li> Great seller great product. Will be using on dogs</li>
    <li> This soap and ointment have made a huge difference in my acne/rosacea. Personally, I do not find the odor obnoxious. These products are cheaper and work for me far better than the &amp;#34;commercial&amp;#34; products on store shelves and prescription items. I like the fact that the ointment is non-greasy and vegan and no PEG or petroleum. The kit was shipped immediately and arrived very quickly in a sturdy carton.</li>
    <li> I started using this about a week ago, I was really skeptical at first because I had been using another sulphur soap and ointment that was working great for my acne and u thought &amp;#34;what your using is working, don&#x27;t mess up now&amp;#34;! However to my surprise this works better than what I was using, and it&#x27;s cheaper! A definite win win! This ointment smells horrible, like really really awful, but it works &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; on my skin! It clears up acne in little as 1 hour, seriously, this stuff is powerful. Try it, you&#x27;ll be glad you did!!</li>
    <li> This product was a miracle.  I broke out with small blisters on both my hands, intense itching all over my body, and a rash all over my stomach.  I went to see a doctor who diagnosed me with scabies.  I ordered this product the same day as my diagnosis.  I used a prescribed medication the first night and then this product twice a day there after.  The prescribed medication took away the itching, but I was left with the blisters and the rash on my stomach that continued to itch terribly.  The product arrived next day just as I had paid for.  I took a shower that night; washing with the body soap and leaving the sulfur ointment on for 10 minutes as it said on the container.  The next morning I could already tell a difference with the blisters on my right hand.  The cream is amazing.  I leave the cream on and do not wash it off as stated on the container to do.  It makes things disappear in a matter of hours.  I had some acne on my shoulders; put some cream on it and in the morning the spots were gone.  My husband woke up with a rash on his chest...he put some cream on it and by the afternoon it was gone.  I do wash my face with the bar of soap, but I do not use the cream as it makes my face dry.  Never in all my years have I had a product work as quickly as these sulfur treatments do.</li>
    <li> WOW! I have had this less than 24 hours and the pimples on my face are almost gone. I don&#x27;t have severe acne, but I do breakout. I bought this for cyst that I will get from time to time from shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully it will work on those too!</li>
    <li> I love the sulfur soap. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Great for getting acne under control! It took 2 months for my skin to stop breaking out so much.  I still have one or two blemishes here and there, but for the most part my skin is healing up.  Also you can use this soap all over to be odor free all day.  This soap has very little fragrance to it, no offensive odor at all, it just smells clean to me.  It didn&#x27;t cause any burning or skin irritation.  It is a little drying so you will need a good body and face lotion after washing.  I&#x27;m glad I bought this and will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> The soap seems very effective so far.  The ointment seems to be drying my skin &amp; hopefully will promote some additional healing.  I like that it is PEG free also!</li>
    <li> I went on a vacation to sulfur spring, NY and noticed that my pimples dried up after showering in the water that contained sulfur ( their tap water actually smells of sulfur)  ..when I happened upon this product, I said I needed to give it a shot.  The soap has the same exact sulfur smell of the water in that shower and did not irritate or even dry my skin out.  I dabbed the smallest amount of the ointment on a few pimples that I have and i woke up this morning 75% improved!!! I am thrilled. I hate using prescription medicines for my pimples and really see this regimen helping my maintain clear skin.  I am super happy I gave this a shot.. So much more affordable than buying tons of chemicals and overloading your skin with harsh cleansers and creams!!</li>
    <li> they do what&#x27;s needed and they were a great bargain!!</li>
    <li> Good product just did not fix the problem with itching.</li>
    <li> Scent is noticeable, but not too strong.  Helps keep the mosquitoes off of me at times, but not always.</li>
    <li> Great all round anti microbial soap with miticidal properties.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this soap to help with my 50 year-old but still acne prone skin (and it seems to be helping, along with the cream, with that) and though there is a light sulfur scent when you sniff the bar, it goes away after rinsing,&lt;br /&gt; Some googling showed that it&#x27;s recommended for use on dogs with mange.  My dogs swim a lot in the summer time and when the lake water warms up, after just a few swims, they start to smell- I assume it&#x27;s some sort of bacteria or fungus that grows in the warmer water because it doesn&#x27;t happen when they swim in the winter.  Regular dog shampoo doesn&#x27;t seem to eliminate the smell, so I thought I&#x27;d give this soap a try.  Eureka!  It works like a champ, and I&#x27;ve also used it once when my pup rolled in some dead critter (anyone who owns a dog knows how hard it is to get out dead-critter smell!) and the musty smell was completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;This soap makes their fur squeaky clean, which I think means it strips all the natural oils, so I wouldn&#x27;t use it more than once every 14 days or so,  but it works very well at getting rid of nasty smells and they don&#x27;t smell at all like sulfur when their fur is dry.  It&#x27;s also much easier to rub a bar of soap over a dog rather than having to squeeze out multiple dollops of liquid shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I love simple solutions!</li>
    <li> Great buy. Will buy more when I&#x27;m out.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast! I would recommend this product to anyone that has issues with their skin.</li>
    <li> This sulfur soap works really well.  I use a lot of coconut oil and olive oil on my skin after showering my skin feels clean and smooth.  My only issue is that this soap is expensive.</li>
    <li> I shared this product and only a little relief.</li>
    <li> Love the soap. Helped with mites. The smell isn&#x27;t even that bad. Dries the hell out of your skin, though. But still a decent product.</li>
    <li> Excellent source to help symptoms</li>
    <li> I purchased the sulfur ointment along with the sulfur bar, however, the ointment broke my face out even more, very greasy and grainy. The sulfur bar is &amp;#34;just ok&amp;#34; I did not notice any improvement after using twice per day for a week. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I used this after having a severe skin rash. My skin feels so much better after using this product.  Packaging was great, delivery time as promised.</li>
    <li> This did not seem to make a difference at all in my acne.  It just dried my out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 30s and have had hormone related cystic acne issues since my mid 20s. I&#x27;ve always used benzoyl/salyctic acid products and find them largely inneffective. Retin A and antibiotics only did so much, and the Retin A was extremely irritating. This last menstrual cycle killed me. Cystic bumps everywhere. I researched alternate solutions and found this. Two days of using the soap and salve have made an enormous difference. The spots are still red, but flat and most non hormonal related acne was eradicated.  The difference is really miraculous....and my skin feels soft as a babys bottom. Recommended. I was very surprised that is was effective on my cystic acne. Nothing else has ever touched it. The ointment does smell like burnt matches or burned out tire rubber...but a temporary inconvenience for sure.</li>
    <li> If only I would have known about this before spending thousands of dollars on dr visits,  grocery store products etc. The cream yielded immediate results. Thank you Amazon and Braunfels Labs!!</li>
    <li> Stuff works awesome!!!!!</li>
    <li> Order arrived quickly and as described. The soap is great. The ointment is fine and as described but I found I preferred the sulfur butter instead of the ointment. The ointment is a little stiff in the jar, not as easy to spread over larger surfaces and seems a little sticky, but it&#x27;s more of a personal preference and this would work just fine for smaller areas.</li>
    <li> I am a 35 year old female and have had severe acne since the age of 12 I have been to dozens of dermatologists and been on everything from Retin-A and ProActive to Accutane twice! But finally I have found the cure to my acne it involves 3 things 1st this product Sulfer Soap I use this every morning 2nd Acnedote I use this every evening on my face chest and back, (this product completely cleared my back and chest in a matter of days) can be found cheap on Amazon!! 3rd 10% Sulfer ointment I use this if I have a breakout (which is very rare) I spread it evenly over my entire face, I will warn you that it feels disgusting like Vaseline, I leave it on for 20 to 30 minutes then use the Acnedote scrub to wash it off. I promise if you are an adult with acne this regiment will clear your skin and reduce the redness from acne scars.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Great product. Works very well on my din&#x27;s pimples. You can see results the next morning.</li>
    <li> Helps great with acne.</li>
    <li> Immediately applied ointment all over my body used Qtip for ears and nostrils light layer on face not near my eyes.Waited 10 hrs washed with the soap..Mites are gone..slepted peacefully,and will continue to use...Thank you..Ohh do a lice treatment on your hair also they will crawl up to get away..</li>
