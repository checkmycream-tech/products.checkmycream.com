      <li>Great motor and blade.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I went with it however, because it it the best set of clippers that I have ever owned.  </li>
      <li>The clippers feel good in my hand and it appears to be built well.  </li>
      <li>Good machine profesional</li>
      <li>Andis makes a good product but</li>
      <li>I have always bought cheap Walmart clippers that break too soon and never quite work that great.</li>
      <li>This pair of clippers is amazing.</li>
      <li>lol) to cool them off...</li>
      <li>Very easy to use</li>
      <li>The Andis 22315 is the best by far.  </li>
      <li>get more than slightly warm after extended use.  </li>
      <li>I researched alot to find the best clippers, I&#x27;m only a novice and cut my own hair.</li>
      <li>The combs are excellent, and I have gotten a great cut every few months for years now.  </li>
      <li>The blade is *very* precise and must be kept well oiled</li>
      <li>Best  overall clipper.</li>
      <li>Satisfied</li>
      <li>Well Satisfied Customer    </li>
      <li>i prefer using the top speed</li>
      <li>First one did a good job as I anticipate this one will do.</li>
      <li>My husband and I cut each others&#x27; hair- after going through many cheap clippers we decided to spring for a \\&quot;top of the line\\&quot; clippers.  </li>
      <li>but they are durable and run very cool.</li>
      <li>Got this based on other reviews I found and am very happy!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s snaps forward for easy cleaning.  </li>
      <li>and although I didn&#x27;t think I needed two speeds, I find the higher speed comes in handy for thicker areas of hair.  </li>
      <li>These are two speed clippers and with my hair being fine</li>
      <li>which sizes would be most useful to you before purchasing them).  </li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve been using it to regularly do the boys&#x27; haircuts (and my husband&#x27;s) for 9 years, and it&#x27;s holding up great.  </li>
      <li>I do miss the adjustable nature of my cheap Oster that lasted me 15 years...</li>
      <li>Andis has a large blade selection and most amazon sellers have them for very cheap (under $30 in most cases) and that makes for reasonable priced replacements.    </li>
      <li>Also, would recommend purchasing the Andis Cool Care Plus spray for disinfecting, cleaning, and light lubrication - works wonders</li>
      <li>I did weeks worth of research looking for good quality professional grade hair clippers.</li>
      <li>My first cut with these clippers took a little over 15minutes and was perfectly evenly.</li>
      <li>It turned my skin bright red.  </li>
      <li>however, I love the performance but the machine makes too much noise when being used</li>
      <li>I purchased the gray Andis  in order to be able to give myself a decently close cut on my head</li>
      <li>Unlike those cheap trimmers, this uses a rotary motor which is smooth and doesn&#x27;t produce a loud buzzing sound.</li>
      <li>Smooth, quiet, cuts great, barely needs maintenance.</li>
      <li>But the Andis 22315 Excel gets hot!  </li>
      <li>This unit gets hot!</li>
      <li>They are very sturdy, well built and deliver a precise haircut.</li>
      <li>Amazon.com has always done right by me.</li>
      <li>It gets hot right away and the heat continues to build no matter the amount of lubricant applied.  </li>
      <li>Have been clipping my own hair for several year now, using cheap Wahl clippers ( which actually have been quite adequate).  </li>
      <li>A definite step up from the $35 Wahl clippers I was using and seem to be much better cut and build quality.</li>
      <li>and now I use a 00000 blade to go over my head 1st and then come back with the grey andis  and end up with a great cut.</li>
      <li>/&gt;US-made for those interested (replacement and additional blades are also US-made).&lt;br</li>
      <li>Lastly, customer service has no choice but to glad handle you and pretend that they have never heard of these problems before.  </li>
      <li>When the Wahl blade broke, I figured I&#x27;d buy a replacement blade - and I decided it was time to look at investing in a higher quality clipper since I now pretty much cut my hair all of the time.  </li>
      <li>but the ultra (steel) blade got warm while using but not hot!    </li>
      <li>The clippers themselves got warm but not hot!  </li>
      <li>A few months later, I replaced it with a Wahl clipper, which works great.</li>
      <li>It seems to cut almost as close as a razor without all the irritation a straight blade would bring.</li>
      <li>One word of advice about blades:  stick with stainless steel.  </li>
      <li>Do yourself a favor and skip the cheap $25 Hair Trimmers found at discount mass merchandise stores and invest in something that is gonna last.  </li>
      <li>They are fast and they get the job done.</li>
      <li>to the touch (no matter how much lubricant is applied to the blade.  </li>
      <li>Quick clean cuts to my military style haircuts.  </li>
      <li>i am very satisified with this product,i can change blades quickly and have the power to cut wet hair,i use it professionally and as a teaching method.the design is comfortable in the hand.</li>
      <li>I have a small Wahl trimmer that does get warm.  </li>
      <li>so i know i&#x27;m getting full power, but its a matter of personal preference.</li>
      <li>The new Andis works really, really well.  </li>
      <li>Watch it and you will see an Oster Classic 76 and why I did not want one.....  </li>
      <li>An Andis classic.</li>
      <li>True the unit housing the motor stays cool, it is the unbelievably poor blade set design which gets hot!  </li>
      <li>Normally</li>
      <li>It takes much much longer to cool down than it does to heat up, so even frequent breaks don&#x27;t resolve the problem.    </li>
      <li>this pair along with every pair of Andis clippers I&#x27;ve ever bought perform, this happens to be my 1st pair of interchangeable blades &amp; I have yet to purchase any other blades to use, personally, I use them to shave &amp; they get slightly warm, no real big deal to me, recommended in my opinion...</li>
      <li>2-Speed Professional Clipper]]Purchased March 2011.  </li>
      <li>I have owned this for several years now, and am SO GLAD that I switched to this from the magnetic clippers that work unevenly.  </li>
      <li>pros:&lt;br /&gt;Gives a very &amp;#34;crisp&amp;#34; professional looking cut.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a 000 blade.&lt;br /&gt;You can buy various size metal blades separately.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with decent-looking plastic guide clips in various sizes if you choose to hold off or not purchase additional metal blades.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The ceramic blades did not cut as well and became dull very quickly.</li>
      <li>Once it is looked at, the source of friction causing the extreme heat is evident.  </li>
      <li>If you want an even cut thats fast quick and cheap, look at buying andis brand clippers (rotary only) and Andis brand ceramic or ultra-edge blade set and you wont for wrong!    </li>
      <li>I purchased four (4) different sizes to go with the clipper, so that came out to another $100 or so to complete the deal.  </li>
      <li>I am fully satisfied with the Andis Clippers I purchased and fully recomend them to anyone serious about cutting their own hair.  </li>
      <li>I was a little hesitant at first since I had never heard of this brand.  </li>
      <li>After over looking Andis Brand (at first) I was dead set of the Oster 76 classics.  </li>
      <li>variable height adjustment found on less expensive clippers, so blending and fading take a little more skill (and switching of blade sizes).&lt;br /&gt;Unforgiving of mistakes since the blades give a very clean cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I highly recommend buying these over any other.</li>
      <li>my big complaint  with the Excel is that the blades tend to overheat quickly.  </li>

    <li> I did weeks worth of research looking for good quality professional grade hair clippers. After over looking Andis Brand (at first) I was dead set of the Oster 76 classics.  But their price, noise level, and potential heavy weight turned me off. Local beauty stores (including sally&#x27;s) charges over $XXX for them.    Andis has a large blade selection and most amazon sellers have them for very cheap (under $30 in most cases) and that makes for reasonable priced replacements.    After using my Wahl&#x27;s Designers w/ comb attachments for the past few years I regret not researching professional clippers sooner.     There is NO COMPARISON to using magnetic clippers w/ comb attachments versus using rotary clippers w/ detachable blades!    My first cut with these clippers took a little over 15minutes and was perfectly evenly. I bought ceramic edge blade and an ultra edge blade to see if the ceramic stays cooler longer (havent tried them yet) but the ultra (steel) blade got warm while using but not hot!    The clippers themselves got warm but not hot!  My Wahls got so hot i had to run water over (not safe or recommended...lol) to cool them off...I was going for a low cut and it took an hour--clippers cut unevenly w.o. comb attachments too!!!    BOTTOM LINE: If you want an even cut thats fast quick and cheap, look at buying andis brand clippers (rotary only) and Andis brand ceramic or ultra-edge blade set and you wont for wrong!    p.s.   These are two speed clippers and with my hair being fine i prefer using the top speed so i know i&#x27;m getting full power, but its a matter of personal preference.</li>
    <li> i am very satisified with this product,i can change blades quickly and have the power to cut wet hair,i use it professionally and as a teaching method.the design is comfortable in the hand.</li>
    <li> Best  overall clipper. Smooth, quiet, cuts great, barely needs maintenance. An Andis classic.</li>
    <li> To Whom it may concern:  This unit gets hot! to the touch (no matter how much lubricant is applied to the blade.  I have two other clippers, a Wahl and an Oster and neither get more than slightly warm after extended use.  I have a small Wahl trimmer that does get warm.  But the Andis 22315 Excel gets hot!  It turned my skin bright red.  I would not use this on another person and definitely not a child or pet.  It gets hot right away and the heat continues to build no matter the amount of lubricant applied.  It takes much much longer to cool down than it does to heat up, so even frequent breaks don&#x27;t resolve the problem.    True the unit housing the motor stays cool, it is the unbelievably poor blade set design which gets hot!  Once it is looked at, the source of friction causing the extreme heat is evident.  The outer blade rides a rail back and forth and that is the rub.    The poor design is such that it also allows hair to enter the underside of the blade set which clogs it within seconds of usage.  The build up of hair then blocks the blade from the bottom which prevents cutting.  Absurd!    Lastly, customer service has no choice but to glad handle you and pretend that they have never heard of these problems before.  Rest assured, they have heard it over and over again.    Remember, Health and Beauty products are NOT returnable.  Sincerly,  Lifelong Amazon Normally Well Satisfied Customer    p.s. Amazon.com has always done right by me.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant at first since I had never heard of this brand.  I&#x27;m glad I went with it however, because it it the best set of clippers that I have ever owned.  Likely the last set of clippers that I will ever buy</li>
    <li> Best hair trimmer I have ever had. Used for like 3 years now without a single hiccup. Great product!!</li>
    <li> The clippers do a great job.  Quick clean cuts to my military style haircuts.  It&#x27;s snaps forward for easy cleaning.  I do miss the adjustable nature of my cheap Oster that lasted me 15 years...it made fades easier.</li>
    <li> Got this based on other reviews I found and am very happy!  It cut my hair on the lower setting like butter.  The only complaint is it gets hot.  You need the Andis cooling gel to use half way through.  Other than that, it works great!</li>
    <li> My decision to go with Andis was primarily because of this:  [...]    Which is titled \\&quot;Slim talks about clippers\\&quot;    Watch it and you will see an Oster Classic 76 and why I did not want one.....  The noise!    I am fully satisfied with the Andis Clippers I purchased and fully recomend them to anyone serious about cutting their own hair.  The clippers feel good in my hand and it appears to be built well.  For those of you who like bald or almost bald, consider the #00000 blade.  It seems to cut almost as close as a razor without all the irritation a straight blade would bring.</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with these clippers.  A organization I worked with owned two of these and all three are still working excellently.  A definite step up from the $35 Wahl clippers I was using and seem to be much better cut and build quality.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a previous Andis Excel model (about 10 years old).  That one worked great but the motor was going out.  The new Andis works really, really well.  Very easy to use and although I didn&#x27;t think I needed two speeds, I find the higher speed comes in handy for thicker areas of hair.  I have been cutting my husbands hair for almost 20 years now and have tried several other clippers.  The Andis 22315 is the best by far.  One word of advice about blades:  stick with stainless steel.  The ceramic blades did not cut as well and became dull very quickly.</li>
    <li> Great motor and blade. The tolerances on the switch and blade cover are a bit loose. It doesn&#x27;t affect function, but cheapens the overall feel. The blade is *very* precise and must be kept well oiled or it will overheat.</li>
    <li> This is second clipper I ordered. First one did a good job as I anticipate this one will do. Satisfied</li>
    <li> Andis makes a good product but my big complaint  with the Excel is that the blades tend to overheat quickly.  Sticking with my Oyster Classics, they&#x27;re a little heavier but they are durable and run very cool.</li>
    <li> Fulfills all pre-purchase expectations/hopes!</li>
    <li> this pair along with every pair of Andis clippers I&#x27;ve ever bought perform, this happens to be my 1st pair of interchangeable blades &amp; I have yet to purchase any other blades to use, personally, I use them to shave &amp; they get slightly warm, no real big deal to me, recommended in my opinion...</li>
    <li> Terrible set of clippers.  Gets hot and burns the hands and the persons head that you are cutting.  Cannot replace or return after 30 days .  Clippers are not something that you use that often and do not know what the results of the clippers are going to be until you use them enough.  30 days was not enough time as I had used them one time.  The second time I used them, I noticed the heat.  It was past the 30 days and I couldn&#x27;t exchange or return.</li>
    <li> We chose this because it was reviewed so well-- I had little kids at the time who were afraid of the clipper noise, and our old cheap Wahl clippers that pulled hair didn&#x27;t help matters at all.  This clipper helped them get over that.  It&#x27;s quieter and it&#x27;s quality.  We&#x27;ve been using it to regularly do the boys&#x27; haircuts (and my husband&#x27;s) for 9 years, and it&#x27;s holding up great.  If this one ever quits, I&#x27;ll buy another with no hesitation.</li>
    <li> Good machine profesional</li>
    <li> I researched alot to find the best clippers, I&#x27;m only a novice and cut my own hair. I have always bought cheap Walmart clippers that break too soon and never quite work that great. This pair of clippers is amazing. I highly recommend buying these over any other. They are very sturdy, well built and deliver a precise haircut. I didnt know what I was missing all these years.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000BBF4L8 Andis 22315BGC2 Excel 2-Speed Professional Clipper]]Purchased March 2011.  My husband and I cut each others&#x27; hair- after going through many cheap clippers we decided to spring for a \\&quot;top of the line\\&quot; clippers.  Reviews were favorable, but after 6 months of use (haircuts every 6 weeks) it began to pull and cut unevenly.  No amount of adjustment would fix this problem.</li>
    <li> for years I have shaved my head bald then  I purchased the gray Andis  in order to be able to give myself a decently close cut on my head but that&#x27;s a long time to do because the grey andis tend to cut slow when you are going for a close cut. I purchased the Clippers to supplement my grey andis and now I use a 00000 blade to go over my head 1st and then come back with the grey andis  and end up with a great cut.</li>
    <li> ive been using the Excels for over a year now. I love it!!! They are fast and they get the job done.</li>
    <li> This product works worse than a $10 clipper. A few months later, I replaced it with a Wahl clipper, which works great. I am writing this review years after my purchase because I saw this item in my orders and I thought to myself \\&quot;this product was my worst purchase ever, I have to write a review on it.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Have been clipping my own hair for several year now, using cheap Wahl clippers ( which actually have been quite adequate).  When the Wahl blade broke, I figured I&#x27;d buy a replacement blade - and I decided it was time to look at investing in a higher quality clipper since I now pretty much cut my hair all of the time.  I am happy I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros:&lt;br /&gt;Gives a very &amp;#34;crisp&amp;#34; professional looking cut.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a 000 blade.&lt;br /&gt;You can buy various size metal blades separately.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with decent-looking plastic guide clips in various sizes if you choose to hold off or not purchase additional metal blades.&lt;br /&gt;A motor that is quiet and doesn&#x27;t seem to strain at all when cutting.&lt;br /&gt;US-made for those interested (replacement and additional blades are also US-made).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;Clipper and replacement / additional blades are not inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;No variable height adjustment found on less expensive clippers, so blending and fading take a little more skill (and switching of blade sizes).&lt;br /&gt;Unforgiving of mistakes since the blades give a very clean cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, really happy with the product, and would recommend spending the money on the clipper.  Bear in mind, though, that if you decide to purchase additional metal blades, they run somewhere between $20 and $30 a piece.  I purchased four (4) different sizes to go with the clipper, so that came out to another $100 or so to complete the deal.  Would recommend waiting, though, until you&#x27;ve used the clipper to decide which sizes to buy (you still have the plastic clip-on guides that come with the clipper, so you can get an idea of which sizes would be most useful to you before purchasing them).  Also, would recommend purchasing the Andis Cool Care Plus spray for disinfecting, cleaning, and light lubrication - works wonders (even used it on my paper shredder)!</li>
    <li> I have owned this for several years now, and am SO GLAD that I switched to this from the magnetic clippers that work unevenly.  The combs are excellent, and I have gotten a great cut every few months for years now.  If you are thinking about upgrading, don&#x27;t be afraid to do it!</li>
    <li> i have received my andis 2 speed excel. it was delivered to me before estimated due date however, I love the performance but the machine makes too much noise when being used</li>
    <li> Do yourself a favor and skip the cheap $25 Hair Trimmers found at discount mass merchandise stores and invest in something that is gonna last.  Unlike those cheap trimmers, this uses a rotary motor which is smooth and doesn&#x27;t produce a loud buzzing sound. The only drawback is the steel cutting plate gets hot after a while so you must rest until it cools down or buy a optional plate made from ceramic.</li>
