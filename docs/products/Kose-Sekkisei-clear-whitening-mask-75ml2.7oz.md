      <li>I never leave reviews but felt this was important.  </li>
      <li>And the price is very reasonable for the many uses you get out of the tube.</li>
      <li>I also didn&#x27;t believe that it would make a significant difference.</li>
      <li>I originally received it as a sample from Bath &amp; Body Works when they used to carry the line.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any significant difference after using it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to try using it after coming out of the shower to see if there is a significant difference.</li>
      <li>Use dry hands and if you can peel it off in one - go, great.</li>
      <li>After I peel it off ,my face feels so clean.</li>
      <li>and when you need a good deep cleansing mask this does the job.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s cool to peel off..</li>
      <li>I am very touch on products and it takes a lot for me to love something.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels &amp; looks awesome after each peel off, especially the next morning..</li>
      <li>It is super sticky, so do NOT get hair caught in</li>
      <li>have to wonder whether this mask (or any &#x27;instant&#x27; kind of product) can have significant whitening properties.  </li>
      <li>so this mask is super fun</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend this product if your looking for something to really stick and get  all the blackheads out.</li>
      <li>This mask is super popular in Asian countries, but I can&#x27;t find it anywhere but online.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>Also, be sure to put on some toner on your face to re-balance your natural oils.</li>
      <li>However, I didn&#x27;t buy this for fun, I bought this for brighter skin.</li>
      <li>and it came right</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s really good to use right after a day out in the sun, I find it to calm my skin A LOT, and doesn&#x27;t leave me as burnt and dark.</li>
      <li>time I&#x27;ll try to apply it (a) more thickly and (2) more evenly, to see if I can get an &#x27;easy peel&#x27; process.  </li>
      <li>This is my first review on amazon and this product was definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>My skin feels so much whiter and clearer after using it!</li>
      <li>My former method of applying this mask was to put on the fingertips of both hands and smear it on, using the fingers to make sure it got to all the areas of my face that I wanted to cover.  </li>
      <li>It worked so well at making my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Just remember not to get it on your eyebrow, that will not be a pretty sight.</li>
      <li>This mask, as well as Biotherm&#x27;s mask, could clean your skin and promise users to white skin, and they have familiar touch, smell and effect.</li>
      <li>If you put a thick enough amount on, it will peel off in one piece; which is awesome!</li>
      <li>(you have to be smart and pull off carefully+Slowly)  </li>
      <li>It certainly pulls out clogged pores and looks like it takes off the outermost layer of your skin based on what the peel looks like after removal.</li>
      <li>I do not need whitening, but I do have flaky skin and large pores.</li>
      <li>Will certainly purchase again.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is strong but more gentle than other similar</li>
      <li>I took a really warm/hottish washcloth</li>
      <li>i really don&#x27;t think this will meet those expectations)</li>
      <li>It really helps with any pimples/impurities in my skin</li>
      <li>However do not expect it too much</li>
      <li>However, it really helps at cleaning pores and reducing acne.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am madly in love with this product.  It worked so well at making my skin soft and smooth.  I am very touch on products and it takes a lot for me to love something.  This product does the job...period.</li>
    <li> love it .easy to remove no skin irritation .</li>
    <li> I had been looking for peel off mask for a while.  This product will do the job but not as good as what I had used before.  It was over 15 years ago, Max Factor has the whitening peel off mask.  Just couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere anymore.  I wish they still have it.  This one will leave your skin clean but if you have deep pore problem it may not be clean enough to you.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an amazing product to use in my esthetics practice and read that this is better than Biore pore strips...I found it to be quite the contrary.  It is not strong enough to pull all compactions out from the pores.  It is now just sitting on my shelf.  I have even offered clients to take it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mask on and off for almost a year. The consistency is sort of runny, so you must apply a lot of the product to get a thick, and even layer. You need a thick even layer to peel the mask effectively, otherwise you end up with random patches of black mask that you have to scrub off. I tend to you this mask when I feel that my pores need extra cleansing. When applied correctly, its definitely effective at removing those random stubborn blackheads, however be careful of your brows because this stuff really adheres to your skin and WILL remove hair. It&#x27;s not worth the price, in my opinion and I&#x27;m not certain how it allegedly whitens.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first because I didn&#x27;t think that a peel off mask would work my my blackhead problems. I also didn&#x27;t believe that it would make a significant difference. However when I received this in the mail I was extremely surprised! This product actually works and it&#x27;s very simple! I steamed my face and spread it over my face following the directions on the box. Then after waiting I peeled the mask off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I COULD ACTUALLY SEE THE DIRT ON MY FACE STICKING TO THE MASK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely impressed. Although all my blackheads didn&#x27;t disappear (mostly because I accidently missed a few spots around my nose) I could immediately tell a difference. The part of my skin that I used the mask on was extremely softer and shinier. Some of the blackheads on my nose didn&#x27;t come out even though I applied the mask there. However I&#x27;m going to try this again next week, concentrating on the areas I missed this time, and I&#x27;ll see where it goes. I&#x27;m going to try using it after coming out of the shower to see if there is a significant difference. This is my first review on amazon and this product was definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I never leave reviews but felt this was important.  You have to put this on thick in order to grab a piece on outer edge to peel off.  Mine did come off all in one mask (you have to be smart and pull off carefully+Slowly)  Also, I wasn&#x27;t anywhere close to the hairline but that was the hardest part to come off.  Yes it might pull on your hair, hence don&#x27;t put it on your hairline it pulls, it might hurt.  I was glad to put this on my nose, cheeks and chin though, my skin was very smooth when I took this off.  For the remnants I could not get off (on outer sides of my face, not in my hairline)  I took a really warm/hottish washcloth and it came right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So don&#x27;t be a baby, and complain that is hurts when pulling off (I read a prior review)  It does pull hair if in your hair, so do NOT put it anwhere close to hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Put it on thick.  This is some major stuff, I can see if you put this on too thin, then it would come off in patches and not in one big mask.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was strange because it feels weird in your fingers, you can tell it is thick, but it&#x27;s doing its job.  I&#x27;ve only used this one time tonight as soon as I got it.  I&#x27;m glad I did, it seems to make my skin feel nice and I will use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> THe product smells good and after drying it holds together and pulls off as one sheet without lots of tearing. I didn&#x27;t notice any significant difference after using it. It didn&#x27;t pull out a lot of stuff from my face and I especially was hoping it would clean up my nose. Overall my skin is pretty good though, so that could be why there wasn&#x27;t a dramatic affect. I also have only used it once so far and it may need several usages to prove itself.</li>
    <li> this leaves my skin sooo soft but it i have a little blackhead issue around my nose and i havent seen this mask get rid of it i had to use another face wash to rid me of balck heads but all the same i love this product does make my face feel soft after the peel</li>
    <li> Fun little peel off mask- as in, it&#x27;s cool to peel off..my daughter gets a kick out of it. However, I didn&#x27;t buy this for fun, I bought this for brighter skin. Waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it because reviewers said it was stong enough to pull hair off- I figured if it could do that, it should be good for removing dead skin cells and white heads. Yeah, not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish products would do what they promise to do. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mask. After I peel it off ,my face feels so clean. I strongly recommend this product if your looking for something to really stick and get  all the blackheads out. I have tried so many products and this one works like a charm.</li>
    <li> This whitening mask, which comes out as thick black shiny goo, smells so good and really peels of the dead skin. It&#x27;s peeling property is so strong, it will even remove tiny hairs from the face, so don&#x27;t get it in the hairline or eyebrows. The more you use it, the more your skin will improve. And the price is very reasonable for the many uses you get out of the tube. A great purchase!</li>
    <li> This is a fun mask that has a lovely scent. I wanted a peel off mask to remove dead skin (not for the whitening..i really don&#x27;t think this will meet those expectations) and this does just that. However, don&#x27;t expect it to be a pore strip, it gets some blackheads but the majority are left unaffected. It peels off pretty good and makes my oily-type skin that gets flaky on occasion, feel smooth once again.</li>
    <li> I REALLY LIKE IT.... THINK ITS GREAT STUFF... WISH BOTTLE WAS BIGGER THOUGH...LITTLE EXPENSIVE FOR THE SIZE. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THOUGH.</li>
    <li> I love this mask. It smells great and really made my skin feel clean after I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, I&#x27;m a picker :-) so this mask is super fun too!&lt;br /&gt;But careful though. It is super sticky, so do NOT get hair caught in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars bc I don&#x27;t think it truly cleared out my pores.&lt;br /&gt;But I have only used it twice, so maybe it will this next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, I highly suggest!</li>
    <li> I have combination skin: oily nose with dry cheeks. I do not need whitening, but I do have flaky skin and large pores. I was hoping it would help peel off the flaky/dead skin on my face that haven&#x27;t decided to fall off yet, and a gentler form of biore pore strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels good going on. The peeling power is firm: it was able to peel off the layer of flaky skin that has appeared on my face after the wintry weather, but not enough to pull off the hairs. However, I recommend do not get it into your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels good, is effective for helping to get rid of flaky skins and makes my pimples feel better. I do not know of its whitening power, but for a peel mask (they are so hard to find), I&#x27;d recommend it. (After taking the mask off, use a cotton ball to swipe the lotion(toner) onto your face as exfoliation, and it makes your skin feel so soft, like a mini spa treat.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another bonus: it peels off in ONE SHEET! For some masks, it&#x27;s too thin/fragile to peel off in one sheet, or it feels like it never dried properly and you have to rub it off. Nope, smear this mask on in a thin layer, but thick enough you can&#x27;t see your skin through it, and it peels off in one nice large sheet (with small pieces around the edge, but that&#x27;s ok).</li>
    <li> I experienced  an bad allergy reaction. Cannot use it any more. It did not improve the skin but made it worse. I have to stop using it after two days. Waste of money. Wish I can return it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second tube of this stuff; the first one I bought a few years ago.  So, I don&#x27;t remember too much about it from back then, but clearly I wasn&#x27;t enamored of it, or I would have kept buying it.  Bought it again this week just for fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to wonder whether this mask (or any &#x27;instant&#x27; kind of product) can have significant whitening properties.  The mask is black and I wonder if it simply makes your skin appear more white when you remove it, because you&#x27;ve been looking at the black thing and then white is the contrast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing is that they must have reformulated this.  It feels like a liquid polymer of sorts.  Yesterday I poured some onto my fingertips.  My former method of applying this mask was to put on the fingertips of both hands and smear it on, using the fingers to make sure it got to all the areas of my face that I wanted to cover.  But last night I put it on my fingertips and it ran down into my palm almost immediately; it&#x27;s thinner than it used to be, so it&#x27;s runnier, and it was very hard to apply.  I put it on (sketchily), and waited until it was dry, and then tried to peel it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I smeared it on too thinly, but I ended up needing about 15 minutes to peel it all off, and it came off in little strips and clumps rather than one big sheet.  And there were sections where I just couldn&#x27;t get a grip on the edge in order to peel it.  In the end I had to remove a lot with my Transport pads, and they came away almost solid black.  My skin felt quite taut after removing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I&#x27;ll try to apply it (a) more thickly and (2) more evenly, to see if I can get an &#x27;easy peel&#x27; process.  But if I can&#x27;t, then this is the last tube of the stuff that I&#x27;ll buy.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Its perfect for what I needed it.  :)</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! This mask makes my skin glow and helps remove all imperfections. Love it and will keep buying it</li>
    <li> This mask is super easy to used and was recommended to me by my aunt :))&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really good to use right after a day out in the sun, I find it to calm my skin A LOT, and doesn&#x27;t leave me as burnt and dark. It works perfectly as a whitening and brightening mask. YOU WILL SEE A DIFFERENCE! This mask is super popular in Asian countries, but I can&#x27;t find it anywhere but online. It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few years now after a trip to Chicago where the store sales rep told me that Britney S. sent one of her people into their store to purchase this product.  I am not sure if that is true or not but in the end the product works great.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! My skin feels so much whiter and clearer after using it! Easy to use and easy to peel off.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It just sits on your face pulls some blackheads out as well as hairs. Im not impressed and would not recommend it. Proce is too much for something that doesnt work.</li>
    <li> This mask, as well as Biotherm&#x27;s mask, could clean your skin and promise users to white skin, and they have familiar touch, smell and effect. However do not expect it too much, i think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is too dry, specially for the dry skin, as me, after using this mask, all spots in my face is even more visible. my face just like field which  based drought stress.....so, without hydro supply, how can it make your skin white?</li>
    <li> This mask goes on nicely and makes your face feel clean and tingly while it&#x27;s drying. That&#x27;s the good part.    The bad part is when you actually take off the mask... I would consider it a form of torture. It will suck out all the moisture from your face, and leave it feeling unhealthy. Also, if you have even a small pimple, it will pull it right off. Unless you have extremely well hydrated, clear skin to begin with, this mask is probably not for you. And in that case, you probably don&#x27;t need the mask.</li>
    <li> This product was given to me from my godmother and it was amazing!! The fact that you can peel the mask off you can see every little pore in your face! The best part is, it does whiten the skin. But you have to use this long term, using this once will not give you skin as white as a baby&#x27;s bottom. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year and when you need a good deep cleansing mask this does the job. Just remember not to get it on your eyebrow, that will not be a pretty sight. The mask does not come off in one easy pull and sometimes there will be some hard to peel parts that require a wipe down with your face cloth.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied, fast shipping , well packaged. Will certainly purchase again.</li>
    <li> hurt like hell after you take off and i dont see the result i thing the mask from cvs work beter i cant say OMG work great because is not sorry</li>
    <li> All it did was pull hair out none of my black heads came out. What a waste of Money. Oh and it broke me out with pimples!</li>
    <li> I was hoping it would work, but the only thing it does is mess. I tried few different methods but none of them removed very little if any of blackheads. It probably exfoliate a bit, but don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Had used this Mask White for at least 2 years now.  I would normally stand in front of the fan to speed up the drying process.  My skin feels &amp; looks awesome after each peel off, especially the next morning..skin looks clear &amp; brighter.  Other than using this Kose Seikisho Mask White, my other love is Sekkisei Herbal Ethetic.  They are the best inventions!</li>
    <li> Who says exfoliation requires rough scrubs?  I stopped using scrubs because they&#x27;re harsh and can cause micro-scratches to your skin surface.  I prefer using this peel-off mask to remove the dead skin cells.  It also takes off whiteheads.  You just need to be sure to use a thick layer, which is not as economical but increases the mask&#x27;s ability to adhere to your skin.  Removal may feel like it&#x27;s tugging on your skin, which may cause temporary discomfort as you&#x27;re pulling it off...not unlike the sensation you feel when peeling off a Biore nose strip.  Afterwards, be prepared for a radiant complexion!  I use it once a week and receive compliments after use.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for me and my boyfriend, we both have blackheads and he has acne  on his face.&lt;br /&gt;Everytime after using this we feel very clean, especially  good for removing blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;It is strong but more gentle than other similar products.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep buying.</li>
    <li> its a famous brand, but doesn&#x27;t worked, i peeled off the mask but the blackhead didn&#x27;t come off, but it did smelled good though</li>
    <li> This is perfect to use every now and then to cleanse your skin. It really helps with any pimples/impurities in my skin and I love peeling it off. (Tip: Use dry hands and if you can peel it off in one - go, great. Otherwise, if you can only peel off pieces, make sure to have a dry area to put the pieces on because if the counter is wet, it&#x27;s harder to clean up. Generally, I flush the mask down the toilet after I&#x27;m done). Also, be sure to put on some toner on your face to re-balance your natural oils.</li>
    <li> Love this mask. I use it once a week. Apply a bit thicker than you think you need so that it will peel off better. You miss the whole point if you don&#x27;t get the good peel-off. It certainly pulls out clogged pores and looks like it takes off the outermost layer of your skin based on what the peel looks like after removal. My skin feels fantastic afterwards.</li>
    <li> Because it  work great&lt;br /&gt;If it work I will like it&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend to my friends and my family</li>
    <li> The product smell very good and after using this product, I can feel the differents immediately. The skin is very smooth. I just love it.</li>
    <li> Kose mask is the best.It helps to pull off dead skin. I&#x27;ve been use it for 3 years and always spare this item.</li>
    <li> peels off great. I steam my face before putting it on to really get the black heads. Always looks like I just got a facial when I&#x27;m down.</li>
    <li> The reasons why this I rated this product a 4 and not a 5 is because of the steep price and the bottle will only last like 8 applications. If you put a thick enough amount on, it will peel off in one piece; which is awesome! I don&#x27;t mind the wait time for it to dry.(20-30min.)&lt;br /&gt;My complexion has benefited from weekly uses.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is light and pleasant.</li>
    <li> This product is a peel off mask that is very effective at taking junk out of pores.  Although it says mask &amp;#34;white&amp;#34;, I did not see any whitening effects from this peel-off black mask.  However, it really helps at cleaning pores and reducing acne.  Would definitely recommend for non-sensitive, oily skin types.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mask for many years.  If I had to guess, I would say about 6 or 7 years total.  I originally received it as a sample from Bath &amp; Body Works when they used to carry the line.  Since then, I have ordered via online retailers.  Hands down this is my favorite facial mask.  I have extremely sensitive skin and this mask has never irritated me at all.  It removes dead skin and even some of the tiny baby-like hairs on my face.  Also, it helps pull out impurities and the overall appearance of my skin looks and feels great.  The scent is not overwhelming (I am allergic to almost all fragrance and this product does not bother me).  I get about 10-12 uses from one container, so the value is excellent in my opinion.  I cleanse, tone, apply the mask, peel off, tone again and then moisturize.  Never had any issues.  One word of caution - be careful around your hairline and eyebrows.  If you accidentally get the product near these areas, simply get a wet paper towel and remove the mask from the areas you don&#x27;t want it.  The same trick works for any area you fail to peel it off from.  Hope this helps someone out there.  :)</li>
