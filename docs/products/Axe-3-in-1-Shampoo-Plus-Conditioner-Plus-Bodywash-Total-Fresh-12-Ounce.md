### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>For a gym bag, or weekend bag, this would be a perfect solution.  </li>
      <li>This 3 in 1 is perfect for my pre-teen son.</li>
      <li>Brilliant from Axe!</li>
      <li>Perfect for every day use and for him to take with him in his swim bag when he goes to the pool in the summer, so he can wash off with it afterwards.</li>
      <li>Great idea Axe!</li>
      <li>A product that I can use to lather up and wash my hair sounds ideal.</li>
      <li>Excellent product, love it!!</li>
      <li>Smells good, cleans well!</li>
      <li>Win, Win, Win!</li>
      <li>LOL SEEMS WHAT I LIKE</li>
      <li>He uses Dove and Axe body washes a great deal.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This works great if I don&#x27;t want to have a couple of bottles to carry with me when I am on a trip.</li>
      <li>This is a great  product.</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>It leaves you smelling great all over.</li>
      <li>It worked great and smelled good to his liking.  </li>
      <li>It has a pleasant smell, and seems to do what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
      <li>The scent is pleasant and lingers on the body and in the hair for hours after washing.</li>
      <li>The fragrance was perfect - not too strong.</li>
      <li>This is a good product.</li>
      <li>And it smells good.</li>
      <li>As I have fairly shirt hair, I cannot speak to the effectiveness of the conditioner.  </li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve been consistently impressed by their product line, not just because we want the boys clean, but because the scents are manly but not overbearing.</li>
      <li>I love this Axe bodywash for the kids, it is literally a great conditioner, shampoo, and a body wash that they can all use.  </li>
      <li>Indeed, most shampoo and conditioner in one bottle I find to be inferior to a separate good shampoo and good conditioner.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>but this one beats most of them!</li>
      <li>I love these products that are 3 in 1!  </li>
      <li>The fragrance of this product is nice.</li>
      <li>, you smell nice today.\\</li>
      <li>He really liked this as well.</li>
      <li>, it has a nice scent and cleans well.</li>
      <li>product smells nice and lathers up well</li>
      <li>However, all in all, this is as good as most 3-in-1 products on the market.</li>
      <li>The scent is nice and manly.  </li>
      <li>It keeps the shower area clutter free, smells great, and leaves skin smooth and hair shiny.</li>
      <li>It does a good job of making your hair and body feel clean.</li>
      <li>The scent is very pleasant and fruity while still maintaining a masculine fragrance to it.</li>
      <li>More like just shampoo and body wash.  </li>
      <li>Logic alone should tell most people</li>
      <li>TO BUY MANY BECAUSE MY GRAND DAUGHTER ALSO LOVES  IT AND SHES 18 WHEN SHE VISITS</li>
      <li>I love this for carrying in my gym bag when I make lunchtime stops at the gym.  </li>
      <li>He&#x27;s loves the simplicity, and many of his friends in his class use the Axe brand body products as well.</li>
      <li>It smells okay</li>
      <li>It does have a nice fresh smell but there are better body washes, shampoos, and conditioners that are also, I think, more cost effective.</li>
      <li>I love the idea of this.</li>
      <li>They have many rules and regulations.  </li>
      <li>I like the idea of a 3 in 1 - mostly because when I go to the gym I don&#x27;t want to carry all three (soap, shampoo and conditioner).</li>
      <li>okay.  </li>
      <li>However, aside from the bottle, we wouldn&#x27;t be able to identify this as an Axe product.</li>
      <li>Leathers up nicely, smells good and doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin much.</li>
      <li>That is important to me because I don&#x27;t like a strong scent of any kind in a shampoo or body wash that lingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But this is a pretty good product.</li>
      <li>I got over being slimed in the shower, this is a pretty good product.</li>
      <li>It is perfect in that there is a single bottle that can be used for soap, shampoo, and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>The most important thing for me in shampoo or body wash are the ingredients.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perhaps not the greatest EVERYDAY shampoo, conditioner and/or body wash, but it surely beats carrying around a bag full of soaps!</li>
      <li>It sounds so easy.</li>
      <li>I was able to get my body clean with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s many perks for his getting clean</li>
      <li>This particular product is very much loved by the \\&quot;man\\&quot; in my life that is using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Axe</li>
      <li>It has a somewhat strong smell &amp; lathers ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And it foams up just fine.</li>
      <li>As a body wash, this is fine.</li>
      <li>The product seems fine if it is used for a day or two.</li>
      <li>feels fine and seems to work.</li>
      <li>hair feels and looks fine after I use this</li>
      <li>They fit all the guidelines.</li>
      <li>now keep a couple of these bottles in the house to use regularly and it is great to have one bottle instead of 3 to take with us in the RV</li>
      <li>The only thing was for a shampoo, it wasn&#x27;t that great.</li>
      <li>The sale price of less than $6.00 makes it even more attractive .  </li>
      <li>He felt clean and refreshed.</li>
      <li>The scent is \\&quot;manly\\&quot;, but not overpowering, it lathers well, and leaves a clean feeling.</li>
      <li>meaning that it&#x27;s clean</li>
      <li>/&gt;Travel, smell like a guy and get clean.</li>
      <li>The scent is pleasant enough if a tab bit stronger than I prefer.  </li>
      <li>Overall, this is still a good option for those who want the ease of a 3 in 1</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad a product.</li>
      <li>product is for the guy who doesn&#x27;t really want to bother with multiple products and doesn&#x27;t care about having the best of any one particular type of grooming product.</li>
      <li>The push latch on the bottle is nice and seems secure enough.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This has a mild scent which I like.</li>
      <li>It works up a decent lather, but this could also be improved some more.</li>
      <li>We didn&#x27;t get that lucky with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Axe 3-in-1 shampoo-conditioner and body wash is convenience all in one very durable, easy to hold, bottle.</li>
      <li>You get clean, although I don&#x27;t like the smell very much.</li>
      <li>While most of the Axe products smell a little too \\&quot;teenage-y\\&quot; for him, he really liked the smell of this one.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is fresh and not overpowering.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Finally, it smells nice to the people that matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>We both really liked the axe deep space.  </li>
      <li>but it still smells like chemicals, and after I&#x27;ve washed with it I don&#x27;t feel so much fresh as chemically cleaned.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Wanna get &#x27;fresh&#x27;?</li>
      <li>So when I saw that they had a 3 in 1 shampoo/conditioner/bodywash, I was willing to give it a shot.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and overall i am mostly pleased with it.</li>
      <li>But he happily scrubs the rest of his body with it without complaint.  </li>
      <li>My young-adult son really liked this to bathe and wash his hair, but it was not really like conditioner.  </li>
      <li>The price has more than quadrupled since the last time I bought it.  </li>
      <li>This is exactly what you need in your gym bag or luggage.</li>
      <li>Give him too many different bath products to use</li>
      <li>(and I&#x27;m pretty furry), so it does seem to work both as shampoo and body wash.  </li>
      <li>Besides, the smell really doesn&#x27;t last much more than an hour and half, and its most strong during showering.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This was purchased for a young lady that after P.E. does not have the time to use 3 different products and make it to her next class.&lt;br /&gt;It is fresh and not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;The big bonus is that it does not smell like fruits or flowers, like most products marketed to the female population.&lt;br /&gt;She has no complains about it as a shampoo or body wash and she can towel dry and get on with her day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We now keep a couple of these bottles in the house to use regularly and it is great to have one bottle instead of 3 to take with us in the RV and it works for all four us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you like it too.</li>
    <li> It smells okay and it cleans okay.  I used to buy this when it was about $4 as an add-on item.  No way I can justify buying it now - at the time of this review and, of course, price is subject to change.  The price has more than quadrupled since the last time I bought it.  It cost more than a larger bottle of American Crew.  Outrageous.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. Works great.</li>
    <li> Convenient,  I have a son who is in the prison system.  They have many rules and regulations.  This makes it much easier than buying each separately.  And a lot less to carry to the shower.  The sale price of less than $6.00 makes it even more attractive .  They fit all the guidelines. 12 oz. or less,</li>
    <li> I USE ALL THEIR PRODUCTS  I BUY THE DRY SPRAY IT DOES THE JOB I HAVE TO BUY MANY BECAUSE MY GRAND DAUGHTER ALSO LOVES  IT AND SHES 18 WHEN SHE VISITS SHE HIT MY RESERVES FROM SHAMPOOS TO BODY WASHS SHE A COLLEGE GIRL AND SHE SAY SHE BROKE LOL SEEMS WHAT I LIKE SHE ENJOYS ALL SO</li>
    <li> Excellent product, love it!!</li>
    <li> I like the fact that Axe 3 in 1 Shampoo Plus conditioner plus body wash does all three functions well. It keeps the shower area clutter free, smells great, and leaves skin smooth and hair shiny. This is a great  product.</li>
    <li> My husband has always used axe on his body and hair.  He told me that this stuff is not nearly as lather friendly as the regular body washes.  The scent is a refreshing clean man smell, but again he said that they have other scents far better and other body washes with a thicker lather.  So of his many axe products he was feeling a little Ho hum on this one.  We both really liked the axe deep space.  He likes it&#x27;s many perks for his getting clean anti like the way he smells when he uses it!</li>
    <li> Axe 3 in 1 Shampoo Plus Conditioner Plus Body.  I love these products that are 3 in 1!  How convenient!  This particular product is very much loved by the \\&quot;man\\&quot; in my life that is using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Axe products are hot products among the men in my life, and I&#x27;m sure, among other men as well.  Axe is very high quality; the smell is out of this world; and it does its job wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highy recommended.  We LOOOOOVE Axe!!!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t typically like 2-in-1 (or, in this case, 3-in-1) products. I prefer shampoo and conditioner to be separate. But this is a pretty good product. It has a pleasant smell, and seems to do what it&#x27;s supposed to. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> My young-adult son really liked this to bathe and wash his hair, but it was not really like conditioner.  More like just shampoo and body wash.  It worked great and smelled good to his liking.  He said that it lathered well.</li>
    <li> I ordered Axe 3 in 1 Shampoo Plus Conditioner Plus Bodywash Total Fresh for my son who loves Axe products. He really liked this as well. The fragrance was perfect - not too strong. He said it did the job. He felt clean and refreshed. The only thing was for a shampoo, it wasn&#x27;t that great. He said he wouldn&#x27;t use it everyday for a shampoo but on lazy days and when in a rush, absolutely!</li>
    <li> Like everything Axe, they have a sense of humor. This 3 in 1 shampoo looks like green slime from Nickelodeon. Fortunately it actually cleans not just cover me in goo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I got over being slimed in the shower, this is a pretty good product. It has the distinctive Axe smell, a little strong not unpleasant. The shampoo side of the equation is a little harsh, but on guys hair - that doesn&#x27;t make a lot of difference. And it foams up just fine. I was able to get my body clean with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slime me at home.</li>
    <li> I felt the price was a little high as compared to Walmart or other local stores. I would not recommend</li>
    <li> I like the idea of a 3 in 1 - mostly because when I go to the gym I don&#x27;t want to carry all three (soap, shampoo and conditioner). A product that I can use to lather up and wash my hair sounds ideal. In reality, though, this smells too much and looks too much like chemicals. The most important thing for me in shampoo or body wash are the ingredients. I try to avoid things like Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, Ammonium Laureth Sulfate, and a few others. This doesn&#x27;t have any of those - it has Sodium Laureth Sulfate which is a milder version of Sodium Lauryl Sulfate - but it still smells like chemicals, and after I&#x27;ve washed with it I don&#x27;t feel so much fresh as chemically cleaned. I&#x27;ve tried other Axe products that I like - and especially like some of their hair styling products - but this one I won&#x27;t try again.</li>
    <li> Axe 3-in-1 shampoo-conditioner and body wash is convenience all in one very durable, easy to hold, bottle. The scent is \\&quot;manly\\&quot;, but not overpowering, it lathers well, and leaves a clean feeling. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My husband used this 3 in 1 wash. He uses Dove and Axe body washes a great deal. While most of the Axe products smell a little too \\&quot;teenage-y\\&quot; for him, he really liked the smell of this one. He didn&#x27;t like that it left his skin feeling a little oily, although it wasn&#x27;t bad enough that he won&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I love this for carrying in my gym bag when I make lunchtime stops at the gym.  It is perfect in that there is a single bottle that can be used for soap, shampoo, and conditioner.  Occasionally, with 3-in-1 products there is an issue with lathering for the shampoo but I did not notice that with this product.  As I have fairly shirt hair, I cannot speak to the effectiveness of the conditioner.  The scent is pleasant enough if a tab bit stronger than I prefer.  However, all in all, this is as good as most 3-in-1 products on the market.</li>
    <li> I had my college age son check this out for me. According to his report, it works quite well as a shampoo/conditioner combo. When you are on the go a lot, reducing the number of shower items you have to manage in the shared dorm shower is a plus. Finally, it smells nice to the people that matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s on sale, go for it.</li>
    <li> The scent is very pleasant and fruity while still maintaining a masculine fragrance to it. It is a real time saver would  recommend on trips or gym. However, not effective as a 3 in 1, conditioner alone is better</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a female and I have been buying Axe products for my boyfriend for years. I usually buy the Phoenix scented products but I planted this in my boyfriend&#x27;s shower to see if he would use it.  He typically uses the Dove Men&#x27;s Care body wash along with their shampoo and conditioner.  He prefers \\&quot;legit\\&quot; shampoo and conditioner and refuses to put this \\&quot;jack of all trades\\&quot; Axe soap on his head.  But he happily scrubs the rest of his body with it without complaint.  (Would a guy really complain about soap?) The scent is nice and manly.  It&#x27;s not too harsh like some other Axe fragrances but its not a light scent either.  For a gym bag, or weekend bag, this would be a perfect solution.  It&#x27;s perhaps not the greatest EVERYDAY shampoo, conditioner and/or body wash, but it surely beats carrying around a bag full of soaps!</li>
    <li> It was really strange to see a product that was a shampoo, conditioner AND body wash in one. My husband says it worked well as a body wash but he didn&#x27;t really like it as a shampoo or conditioner. He felt it did not condition his hair at all. The fragrance of this product is nice.</li>
    <li> Any product that claims to be be a 3 in one I&#x27;m leery of. Indeed, most shampoo and conditioner in one bottle I find to be inferior to a separate good shampoo and good conditioner. This product is no exception. It does have a nice fresh smell but there are better body washes, shampoos, and conditioners that are also, I think, more cost effective. I&#x27;ll continue using separate body wash, facial soap, shampoo, and conditioner. Logic alone should tell most people it&#x27;s unlikely a good facial soap would also be a good shampoo and/or conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is for the guy who doesn&#x27;t really want to bother with multiple products and doesn&#x27;t care about having the best of any one particular type of grooming product.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. I only need one bottle on my shelf for body wash, shampoo and conditioner. I also like the fact that I don&#x27;t need a crow bar to get the lid off, as it has a push button on the side to pop the lid up! Smells good, cleans well!</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of Axe body spray for a few years now and I have tried their bodywash and their shampoo in the past. So when I saw that they had a 3 in 1 shampoo/conditioner/bodywash, I was willing to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product smells nice and lathers up well but the scent does not stay with you. As a shampoo it really doesn&#x27; t do anything for my hair. I think a 3 in 1 product is going a bit far. In the future I will be keeping my shampoo and bodywash seperate.</li>
    <li> Everything in one container... And it smells good. Win, Win, Win!</li>
    <li> My husband usually prefers using various kinds of Axe body wash, but he doesn&#x27;t care for this Total Fresh 3-in-1.  The push latch on the bottle is nice and seems secure enough.  However, aside from the bottle, we wouldn&#x27;t be able to identify this as an Axe product. It does not have the typical intense, longer lasting cologne-like scent that we both enjoy.  Instead, there&#x27;s only a hint of fresh scent, with a lingering not-so-nice \\&quot;after\\&quot; smell that&#x27;s seems a little \\&quot;off\\&quot; to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole, this is pretty bland to us and not at all like the more exciting versions of Axe that we have come to appreciate. We neither like nor hate this product, but we wouldn&#x27;t choose this again, since it doesn&#x27;t smell as good or perform better than some cheaper brands that we know of.</li>
    <li> I love this Axe bodywash for the kids, it is literally a great conditioner, shampoo, and a body wash that they can all use.  This is something that saves me money, and I know that they are going to use it because they don&#x27;t have to open three bottles.  Great idea Axe!</li>
    <li> My son volunteered to try out a variety of bath products.  An older teen, he is pretty picky about his products.  His review follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a high school student, I would recommend this product to those who don&#x27;t like to spend much time in the shower. It has a somewhat strong smell &amp; lathers ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 3 in 1 definitely cleans from head to toe as advertised. However, I personally think it weird that my hair smells the exact same as my body, and I am unsure if the product really cleans as compared to separate bottles of shampoo, conditioner, and body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, this product did work for me, but it is a matter of preference whether you want to have the same, somewhat-strong smell for both your hair and your body.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of this. It sounds so easy. Just shampoo and wash your body with the same bottle of product. I&#x27;m not sure if this is something that can actually work in practice. As a body wash, this is fine. It lathers like it should, it has a nice scent and cleans well. As a shampoo/conditioner I feel it leaves hair feeling greasy. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of the body wash aspect of the product or not, but I can&#x27;t recommend this as a shampoo.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not bad a product. You get clean, although I don&#x27;t like the smell very much. I also think this product is a bit pricey. For my money, I&#x27;d probably go a different direction.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this 3 in 1 shampoo for a couple weeks now and overall i am mostly pleased with it. The scent is your standard axe scent, but it isnt anywhere near the &#x27;heaviness&#x27; of axe cologne. Besides, the smell really doesn&#x27;t last much more than an hour and half, and its most strong during showering. Thats one thing that could be improved, if they could get the smell to last longer. It works up a decent lather, but this could also be improved some more. It does a good job of making your hair and body feel clean. Overall, this is still a good option for those who want the ease of a 3 in 1</li>
    <li> Brilliant from Axe! This is exactly what you need in your gym bag or luggage. It covers all the bases: shampoo, conditioner, scented body wash. Love it! It&#x27;s not going to replace my typical shampoo, because I don&#x27;t care for most shampoo/conditioner combos (they leave your hair seeming only half clean and less than well-conditioned imo) but this one beats most of them!</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s what I learned about my shampoo habits from this.  This Axe 3 product left my hair feeling cleaner and softer than pretty much any other shampoo ever.  I told the woman who cuts my hair this, and she said, \\&quot;that means you&#x27;re using way too much shampoo normally. For most high quality shampoos, you should only be using a dime-size amount.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out she&#x27;s right in that \\&quot;better\\&quot; salon shampoos do make my hair feel cleaner if I use less, but I&#x27;m rarely awake enough and in too much of a hurry to do anything smart like notice how much shampoo I&#x27;m using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s odd that it does lather more on one&#x27;s head than on one&#x27;s body (and I&#x27;m pretty furry), so it does seem to work both as shampoo and body wash.  The fragrance is \\&quot;fine\\&quot; meaning that it&#x27;s clean (something I would have marketed as sporty blue instead of fresh green) and masculine, but not something where anyone will say \\&quot;gosh, you smell nice today.\\&quot;  I think it fades about 10-30 minutes after the shower. If you buy body wash based on fragrance, I would think you&#x27;d find this to be run-of-the-mill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It occurs to me this would be a good product for guys who wash their hair multiple times a day (after waking up, after the gym, etc) because there seems to be less build-up. I would definitely get this product again.</li>
    <li> No need to pack soap, shampoo, and conditioner when you have this Axe 3 in 1 shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. It leaves you smelling great all over. Not sure about the effectiveness of the conditioner, but I don&#x27;t have much hair. I think there is too much hype in the soap, body wash market. How much better can one product be than the other?</li>
    <li> This 3 in 1 is perfect for my pre-teen son. Give him too many different bath products to use and he&#x27;s at a loss as to which to use for what. I far prefer handing him a single bottle to use instead of always having a pre-shower explanation of \\&quot;Use the blue bottle for washing your hair, use the grey bottle for conditioner (but just a little bit!) and use the green bottle with your sponge for your body\\&quot;, then half way through the shower hearing him yell, \\&quot;What was the grey one for again?!\\&quot;. Now, I can just hand him this bottle and tell him to wash all over with it. From his hair to his toes, just use this bottle. He&#x27;s loves the simplicity, and many of his friends in his class use the Axe brand body products as well. He likes using the same kinds of thing as his friends do, so he took to this hair and body wash right away. Perfect for every day use and for him to take with him in his swim bag when he goes to the pool in the summer, so he can wash off with it afterwards.</li>
    <li> I have never tried an all in on  shampoo, conditioner and body wash. It seems to be geared toward those times when men are in a hurry and don&#x27;t want to carry both a shampoo and a body wash.  It works fine for specific uses but I would not use this at home on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to my hair I have some dandruff and like shampoos that have  Pyrithione Zinc which helps fight that problem. This does not have that ingredient and it is not advertised as a dandruff shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels and looks fine after I use this but I think long term use would ignore my dandruff problem.  I have no problem using this if I am on an overnight trip but I would rather use a dandruff shampoo on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body wash part of this feels fine and seems to work. My skin can be sensitive at times to some products and this feels fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a mild scent which I like. I  barely notice it after I shower. That is important to me because I don&#x27;t like a strong scent of any kind in a shampoo or body wash that lingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works great if I don&#x27;t want to have a couple of bottles to carry with me when I am on a trip. The product seems fine if it is used for a day or two. When I am home I want my dandruff shampoo and body wash to be separate items.</li>
    <li> My son keeps this in this travel bag for visits to relatives or out of town sporting events. Leathers up nicely, smells good and doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin much. He has eczema, so most products are irritating but he really likes Axe, some of their products don&#x27;t bother him at all. We didn&#x27;t get that lucky with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travel, smell like a guy and get clean.</li>
    <li> ...but as recently as 6 years ago Axe was a product line I&#x27;d never heard of, but now it&#x27;s got the sort of cool cache that makes it an acceptable stocking stuffer and gets two boys--one 16, one 11--to take at least a mild interest in their personal hygiene.  We&#x27;ve been consistently impressed by their product line, not just because we want the boys clean, but because the scents are manly but not overbearing.</li>
    <li> Total Fresh gets 5 stars as an all-in-one body wash. Useful for those who want to carry just one male scent body wash with them to the gym, while camping, the pool, or wherever. I would say it is not &#x27;ideal&#x27; for the mature male and his every day hygiene regime, but for the youth set and those who need a body wash/shampoo in a single bottle, it&#x27;s great. The scent is pleasant and lingers on the body and in the hair for hours after washing. It loses a star because it&#x27;s not really a great shampoo. But it does the job in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanna get &#x27;fresh&#x27;? This is &#x27;totally&#x27; your product. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kort</li>
