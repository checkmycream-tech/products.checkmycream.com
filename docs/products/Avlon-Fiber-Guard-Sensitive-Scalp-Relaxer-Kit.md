      <li>does not burn the scalp which is really good for me because I have very sensitive skin and protects the hair, nice and shiny look.</li>
      <li>Since I do my own hair and the price is right for me.</li>
      <li>I noticed a significant change in my hair&#x27;s texture.</li>
      <li>I really believe this type of relaxer (which I feel is milder on my hair) has been the true reason my hair has stayed healthy -</li>

      <li>Ever since my sister introduced me to Affirm, I have been a true and almost loyal user.</li>
      <li>I like that you can adjust the strength from mild to resistant.</li>
      <li>so I purchased the mild relaxer.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not only one of the most gentle relaxers I&#x27;ve dealt with, but was great on my 2 yr natural hair.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping!!</li>
      <li>let me tell you it is DIFFICULT to find Affirm in Canada, where as it was cheap and easy to find in Brooklyn, lol.</li>
      <li>The real truth to the success with this product and a exspensive lesson learned for myself who cares about the true texture and longivity of my hair.  </li>
      <li>He couldn&#x27;t bare to see or her his precious daughter&#x27;s</li>
      <li>Every time her dad would see me getting ready to do her hair he would leave the house!</li>
      <li>This was my first purchase of this relaxer</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s actually better than whatever was used when I went to two different stylists to get my hair done.</li>
      <li>I most definitely will not be purchasing this product ever again!!!</li>
      <li>I love it so much I will be ordering it again in the future.</li>
      <li>This was my first time using this product: I can say I really like the product because it didn&#x27;t burn.</li>
      <li>I read some of the reviews here  and thought it would not be strong enough, so I went to resistant.  </li>
      <li>However, Ugly Beauty sent it quickly and seem to have the best prices.  </li>
      <li>African American hair that will dred even with the most diligent care!</li>
      <li>I totally recommend it for fine hair.</li>
      <li>Even though I only relax for mild every 10 to 12 weeks (she is a child after all!)</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t burn and straightened very well.  </li>
      <li>If you need pin straight you must use heat.</li>
      <li>This line of products works very well on my hair.</li>
      <li>Straight, manageable hair that will take and hold a curl.</li>
      <li>My hair was too straight.  </li>
      <li>It was more than what I expected.</li>
      <li>It really works well.</li>
      <li>My hair comes out straight, but not bone straight, and when they tell u</li>
      <li>it retains 40 percent more strength than other relaxers, its no lie.</li>
      <li>Next time, I&#x27;m going to do normal or maybe even mild.  </li>
      <li>I have purchased this from another vendor in the past, however, the latest is from UglyBeauty.  </li>
      <li>I usually never write reviews</li>
      <li>and yes, I choose to relax my hair as opposed to going natural (tried natural, but it just wasn&#x27;t for me)and</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think even regular would get you bone straight.</li>
      <li>My hair feels soft and it&#x27;s not harsh on my scalp.</li>
      <li>Also, there was NO overly toxic, chemical smell that had to be aired out of my hair.  </li>
      <li>SENSITIVE  </li>
      <li>I was afraid give myself a perm, but I did and the final result is great.</li>
      <li>The first time I used this product my hair was fine, but the second usage my hair became very dry, excessive shedding, breakage, and my hair changed a reddish color</li>
      <li>I have actually used fiber guard sensitive for 2 yrs and then had to change salons.</li>
      <li>I have very fragile course hair and a sensitive scalp to boot.  </li>
      <li>One month later my hair is still manageable and soft and no split ends.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have no regrets or hair damage as a result .</li>
      <li>We are not interested in pin straight hair.</li>
      <li>this relaxer make my hair BLING and the texture comes out much softer v.s. other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>I mixed the ingredients as per the package and the result on my thick, virgin growth of 1 year was better than i expected.  </li>
      <li>My hair is full and thick with straightness that is manageable.</li>

    <li> This was my first purchase of this relaxer so I purchased the mild relaxer.  I had worn my hair in braids for a year growing out my hair.  I mixed the ingredients as per the package and the result on my thick, virgin growth of 1 year was better than i expected.  I didn&#x27;t leave the perm on longer than the time it took to process through the entire head of hair.  (I did not keep it on until it burned)&lt;br /&gt;Result... Straight, manageable hair that will take and hold a curl. I am very impressed with the product.  Also, there was NO overly toxic, chemical smell that had to be aired out of my hair.  One month later my hair is still manageable and soft and no split ends.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice in 09&#x27; and 2010.  The first time I used this product my hair was fine, but the second usage my hair became very dry, excessive shedding, breakage, and my hair changed a reddish color (I don&#x27;t even color my hair!!!). I purchased this product from sleekhair.com (maybe I was sold a bad batch). I most definitely will not be purchasing this product ever again!!!</li>
    <li> Purchased the kit in 2009. Extremely happy with the conditon of my hair as I color&lt;br /&gt;to cover the gray. The strength and textured of my hair has improved over time. My hair doesn&#x27;t pop when I comb it now. I recently ran out of the perm and used another over the counter. The difference after relaxing was day and night. I am now going back to Affirm.</li>
    <li> I received a box that obviously had been opened and the contents were broken. I usually never write reviews but I needed to do this.</li>
    <li> I used it on my thick wavy hair and it did not work! Not sure what went wrong. I read the instructions twice, maybe i did not mix it well?</li>
    <li> Didn´t get my hair straight and left it like glued to my scalp and stiff.  My hair moved with my head as if it were a helmet. Didn´t burn or cause breakage but not good</li>
    <li> This line of products works very well on my hair. It&#x27;s actually better than whatever was used when I went to two different stylists to get my hair done. Thoroughly satisfied.</li>
    <li> I used to travel back and forth between Canada and USA...let me tell you it is DIFFICULT to find Affirm in Canada, where as it was cheap and easy to find in Brooklyn, lol. Ever since my sister introduced me to Affirm, I have been a true and almost loyal user. I really believe this type of relaxer (which I feel is milder on my hair) has been the true reason my hair has stayed healthy - and yes, I choose to relax my hair as opposed to going natural (tried natural, but it just wasn&#x27;t for me)and I have no regrets or hair damage as a result .</li>
    <li> This is an excellent relaxer. I have used it for years and when I stopped using it I noticed a significant change in my hair&#x27;s texture. It is not as harsh as other relaxers. It doesn&#x27;t cause my natural hair color to fade over time like other relaxers do.</li>
    <li> As long as I&#x27;m relaxed, I will use Affirm Fiber Guard....this relaxer make my hair BLING and the texture comes out much softer v.s. other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  I very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I have very fragile course hair and a sensitive scalp to boot.  I like this product it works well along with their shampoo and conditioner. My hair feels soft and it&#x27;s not harsh on my scalp.</li>
    <li> Great Relaxer. Since I do my own hair and the price is right for me. This is a great relaxer and it makes my hair feel nice.</li>
    <li> I have only used this relaxer once before but was unable to purchase without a professional license.  Thank you Amazon and your marketplace, I will now be able use this wonderful product at home.</li>
    <li> I love this relaxer. I have always had problems with my hair. Noticeable damage has occurred with almost every relaxer I&#x27;ve tried. My hair always comes out bone straight with other relaxers which leaves it very thin and unmanageable. I have actually used fiber guard sensitive for 2 yrs and then had to change salons. The salon I changed to used Mizani and the regular affirm relaxer. I hated both. FINALLY ive order affirm fiber guard and immediately I saw results. My hair comes out straight, but not bone straight, and when they tell u it retains 40 percent more strength than other relaxers, its no lie. My hair is full and thick with straightness that is manageable. Wonderful product. I will never change products again.</li>
    <li> This perm works great on my hair.  I only gave 4 stars due to the vendors does not offer the option of the complete system if desired meaning.  The real truth to the success with this product and a exspensive lesson learned for myself who cares about the true texture and longivity of my hair.  You MUST combine the relaxer system with some of the following to achieve the effects of softness and non-breakage.      STEP 1 PRESERVO   Strengthening Serum  STEP 2 SENSITIVE  Scalp Cream Relaxer (FIBER GUARD)  STEP 3 FORTIFYING Treatment  STEP 4 NORMALIZING Shampoo    EXTRA for after care of relaxer  ***NOTE*** All Kera Care products are by AFFIRM as well.    KERA CARE LEAVE IN CONDITIONER  KERA CARE SILEN SEAL   (BLOW DRY)    I, hop this helps all who want the full effects of this relaxer system</li>
    <li> I have purchased this from another vendor in the past, however, the latest is from UglyBeauty.  It contains the basics for what is needed-containers of relaxer and small bottle of activator.  In the past, the kit included a REALLY large 32 oz size bottle of activator, so I am a bit disappointed.  Hopefully, it will be sufficient amount to mix 9 containers, but that remains to be seen. For the cost, I would have preferred the larger bottle, as I do not think the activator is sold separately.  However, Ugly Beauty sent it quickly and seem to have the best prices.  My advice is to stock up on the larger sets that offer the Protecto as well and order well in advance of needing a kit.</li>
    <li> I was always told that Affirm was one of the best relaxers out there, but I&#x27;ve never used it until now.  It&#x27;s not only one of the most gentle relaxers I&#x27;ve dealt with, but was great on my 2 yr natural hair.  I&#x27;ve been relaxed for 5 weeks  now,  and I&#x27;ve not seen any breakage.  I will continue to use affirm products.</li>
    <li> It really works well.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using this product: I can say I really like the product because it didn&#x27;t burn. It was really nice not to have burning. So, I like it.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist advised me to use this product. I was afraid give myself a perm, but I did and the final result is great. Easy to use! I totally recommend it for fine hair.</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast shipping!!</li>
    <li> does not burn the scalp which is really good for me because I have very sensitive skin and protects the hair, nice and shiny look.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. I have thin hair and this product together with step 1 helps avoid hair breakage and fall out.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for leaving your hair conditioned after being relaxed.  Absolutely great product!!  Will definitely purchase again!!</li>
    <li> Used it once. Didn&#x27;t burn and straightened very well.  I like that you can adjust the strength from mild to resistant. I read some of the reviews here  and thought it would not be strong enough, so I went to resistant.  Next time, I&#x27;m going to do normal or maybe even mild.  My hair was too straight.  Love this.  Update: Have been using this since last year and will never use another relaxer again. I&#x27;m so happy to finally find the one best for me.</li>
    <li> I really love this product and would recommend this product to others.  This product has made it easy for me to do my own hair and the results are wonderful.</li>
    <li> Great if you are just looking to texturize. I guess all chemicals cause damage but, I have yet to find it. I use on my daughter who has extremely course dry, kink coil patterned, super thick and long (to her waist!) African American hair that will dred even with the most diligent care! She is 8 and started getting this and only this relaxer at 7. People may judge and say she is getting it done too soon but, you have never seen the horrible of her hair grooming without! Anyone walking by would want to call the cops if they heard her blood curdling screams! Every time her dad would see me getting ready to do her hair he would leave the house! He couldn&#x27;t bare to see or her his precious daughter&#x27;s torment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short this helps relieve a lot of stress for everybody! Even though I only relax for mild every 10 to 12 weeks (she is a child after all!) I don&#x27;t think even regular would get you bone straight. If you need pin straight you must use heat. I follow all the steps and use all suggested affirm products only! Then I heat protect and blow dry. We are not interested in pin straight hair. This calms and softens the strands just enough for easier management.</li>
    <li> Excellent E-bayer great deal</li>
    <li> I love it so much I will be ordering it again in the future. It was more than what I expected.</li>
