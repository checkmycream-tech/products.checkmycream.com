<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good light hydrating lotion... Nothing spectacular...but good</li>
    <li> Great light moisturizer. It keeps my skin soft but not oily, which is an issue I had with a lot of other creams.</li>
    <li> Avene Hydrance is excellent and hydrating very well leaving the skin silky and without greasiness. I received this product on time and in perfect condictions.</li>
    <li> I have a combination skin and I&#x27;ve been looking for a decent moisturizer.  If anyone out there is looking for a light moisturizer for their combo skin; i.e. visible pores, slightly redish cheeks, dry skin near lips area, this light cream will help you.  Moreover, it has a mild pleasant scent and is quickly absorbed all over face area.</li>
    <li> I have oily, breakout prone, sensitive skin that is very dehydrated from using retin a. I have had a hard time finding a moisturizer that will give me enough hydration without making me breakout. This moisturizer is great. The ingredients really are non-comedogenic (unlike some moisturizers that claim to be non-comedogenic,yet still have pore clogging ingredients). It absorbs very quickly and gives me just the right amount of moisture without being greasy. It wears very well under makeup, and while most fragrances in moisturizers tend to bother my eyes this one does not. I will continue to buy this again and again.</li>
    <li> Good product, rich cream version is better during winter in New England.</li>
    <li> Great light weight creme.  I have very sensitive skin with Rosacea and it doesn&#x27;t irritate</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my sensitive, combination skin.</li>
    <li> I use this cream for many years now and I could never think of anything better for my  combination sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This cream feels amazing on the skin.  I use it in conjunction with their toner.  It&#x27;s not heavy and doesn&#x27;t lead to oily skin but has enough hydrating properties to keep you face from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer creams and lotions to be in capped bottles, but this deliver method works.  The only problem is that you lose out on the last bit of cream unless you&#x27;re awesome at squeezing out the last bit in these types of bottles.</li>
    <li> Absolutely in love with this face lotion , skin feels hydrated and looking fresh and glowing</li>
    <li> The best, and the only one that gives my skin the ideal level of hydration that I need.</li>
    <li> My skin is allergic to everything and hates the world, so only this product worked for my face! Not too oily either- Love it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was in Paris over the summer and ran out of night cream.  I went to the pharmacy and a very helpful Parisian man who worked at the pharmacy helped me to find something that would fit my skin type.  There is a similar version to this that has SPF in it, but I didn&#x27;t really need that, seeing I was going to only use it at night.  After using it only once, I immediately fell in love with it.  The scent is very light.  What amazed me the most was the texture of the cream.  It is very smooth and silky and absorbs so well into the skin.  I would highly recommend this to anyone, especially for use as a night cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using Avene products for over two years now and I&#x27;m completely satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Other face lotions would irritate my skin and soon I would get ugly pimples or even acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried Avene Hydrance Optimale Light Hydrating Cream, and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;No oily film, no pimples and no irritations at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is expensive, but my skin loves it.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin and this light lotion works wonders for me.  It hydrates my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave it oily.</li>
    <li> I love Avene products, but I did not receive what I ordered! I had ordered the light hydrating cream to use on top of my 45 SPF sunscreeen during the day and to use solo at night. When I opened the package, I was disappointed to see that they had sent me an Avene moisturizer with 25 SPF...that is NOT what I ordered! I prefer NOT to use SPF while I sleep at night because it is completely unnecessary. Upon closer inspection, I noticed a secondary label had been placed on the box - I assume to expedite distribution, and that appears to be the culprit behind the error. Someone had put the wrong bar code on the box I received. I had no choice but to keep the product as I was traveling the next day &amp; was completely out of moisturizer, but I am NOT happy that I didn&#x27;t get the correct product! I hope that someone will read this and do some quality control on their bar code protocol!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same cream for a few years now. I really like it because it is very light but at the same time it gives me enough moisture. It is very helpful for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this product in Mexico as it was the only product the dermatologist recommended for sensitive skin.  It is the only one that does not clog my pores and it is very light not oily or heavy feeling, so I am quite pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> An excellent moisturizer for someone needing something light, but hydrating. I use this in the summer as my primary moisturizer and only trade off to a richer cream in the winter because I get so seriously dry. After using this for over a year, my sensitive skin has never been happier! No breakouts, stinging, or any negative reactions.</li>
    <li> suitable for those with oily skin - light texture</li>
    <li> the BEST crème ever for any type of skin issue.  Just removes the itch or pain.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the Avene products and wish I could find in stores more often, happy to be able to find online. Great light cream without oiliness.</li>
    <li> My favorite facial cream, great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> A great light weight lotion that doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts on my sensitive, oily skin. My husband even likes this lotion a lot!</li>
    <li> a GREAT cream at a bargain price. This brand works like crazy and is about a third of the cost of the &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; creams, and about 70% less than La Mer and the others</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing. Better if used during fall and winter. It may be too oily in summer for oily skin people.</li>
    <li> Great coverage; still lightweight and not greasy. Very, very light fragrance. Keeps skin hydrated and supple throughout the day. Great cream</li>
    <li> I stumbled upon this brand years ago and it&#x27;s just the best. It absorbs good and is not greasy. It feels very nourishing to the skin. I have lots of their stuff. Love it.</li>
    <li> Love this cream! Used it for a few weeks at night and I really like it.</li>
    <li> In the winter, I use it as is. In the summer, I wet my hand a little to dilute it. Love it. I use nothing but Avene on my face. No one can tell my age. I&#x27;ve been using Avene products for at least 10 years. No interest in anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay out of the sun and use Avene. Eternal youth.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 1 year now, during winters and summers. It is perfect for my skin. Most of my face products are Avene. They are soothing, won&#x27;t make my skin break and I love the smell.</li>
    <li> this product is great if you have very sensitive skin.does not have all the harsh chemicals to make your skin breakout.it&#x27;s a very light lotion which works great in the summer.</li>
    <li> My favorite cream ever!</li>
    <li> I was looking for an everyday face cream. this one is good, but i like oil of olay better, but this is a great product.</li>
    <li> This cream is very moisturizing and gentle, leave my skin soft but not oily. It is good for the winter.</li>
    <li> So hydrating and light at the same time... I can&#x27;t get enough of my Avene Hydrance Optimale Light Hydrating Cream. My dermatologist recommended it and she couldn&#x27;t have been more right about it,</li>
    <li> When my regular moisturizing cream was taken away at an airport check point in Paris, I was forced to find a substitute. I found this cream and liked it so much that it is now what I use exclusively.</li>
    <li> It works great with my crazy sensitive skin. Now I will only use this product.</li>
    <li> a very light cream but for my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I tried this cream as a replacement for the equally lightweight Avene Cream for Intolerant Skin (which can be tricky to find in the U.S.). While this product goes on lightweight, it irritated my extremely sensitive, eczema-prone skin. I was very surprised to learn that this product is NOT FRAGRANCE-FREE, as fragrance can be a real trigger for sensitive skin. For all of the care Avene takes in making its other products 100% sterile and formulated without preservatives or fragrances, I don&#x27;t know why they feel the need to add fragrance to this one. Will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Avene is my brand. I have a sensitive skin and Avene protects it and hydrates my skin very well.&lt;br /&gt;The shipment was great ... a bit pricey but worth it ! :)</li>
    <li> This is very pricey compared to what I have been using so far, but this is great! My skin feels smooth and I don&#x27;t get any breakouts. I think I&#x27;m gonna use this for wintertime.</li>
    <li> Took me awhile to find a facial moisturizer that goes on light</li>
    <li> Use this at nose chin area to not get pimples.</li>
    <li> This is a lightly fragrance face moisturizer. It works very well on my sensitive, combination-type skin.&lt;br /&gt;No reactions so far(been using it for 6 months now). Really like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels light on the skin, and readily absorbed. Moreover, it is hypoallergenic and non-comedogenic which I was looking for, because I am acne prone. My only gripe is that it is pricey. But I very rarely find a cream that suits my skin, so I&#x27;m going to stick to it.</li>
    <li> Great brand, it&#x27;s light and hydrating. Left my skin smooth. ;)</li>
    <li> This product is lightweight and mild. Great for sensitive skins. Many things can influence skin conditions, so it is hard to improve damaged or very sensitive skins by just using some skin care products. But this one really works for me. It is mild and lightweight and soothes my skin well. I got some skin issues last September and my skin looked &amp;#34;terrible&amp;#34; for almost half a year. My skin looks pretty good now. I don&#x27;t think these Avene products can change skin conditions dramatically in a short time but I do think they have a long-term good effect on mine.</li>
    <li> good product and value</li>
    <li> Great!!  Good for combination skin!</li>
    <li> Literally the most perfect face lotion I have ever used!!!</li>
    <li> Very soft for different kinds of skins. I really like it. Not too expensive and it is really good for use.</li>
    <li> Since I was looking for a light cream that is&lt;br /&gt;light enough just decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;It is really light, non-greasy, and non-comedonogenic&lt;br /&gt;in comparison with others that have sigh about it.&lt;br /&gt;Works excellent for me.</li>
    <li> I have sendintive skin and this works great,  I use this or the non spf version every day.  Not to heavy on the skin and the spf25 seems to do the trick.</li>
    <li> I love this light cream and use it for 1 year. It is really light and gentle on face skin.</li>
    <li> My wife likes it very much, good for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My skin loves this cream, is light and hydrating :)</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and have to be very careful what makeup I use or I will break out.  This is non-irritating, very light and sinks into my skin very quickly.  It doesn&#x27;t take much.  One tube lasts me quite a while.  I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for super-sensitive skin, it has become my go-to lightweight moisturizer for the warmer months. If only it contained some SPF as well.</li>
    <li> It is not fake stuff. I like it and plan to buy more.</li>
    <li> the cream is very light and absorbes in a short time, leaves a clean, smooth feeling. It has no parfum so it is  neutral in smell. I use it in the mornings under my make up and in the evenings. My skin is very sensitive , the cream does not irritate at all. I love it and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> this is very nice!! No greasy feeling at all only down side is that product is small - but it works! I don&#x27;t use it everyday since I actually have very sensitive combo skin - sometimes I feel this is not moisturizing enough for that reason.</li>
    <li> Lovely smooth and delicate on my acne prone skin. Love it. Does not break me out.</li>
    <li> I purchesed this for my wife, she loves it!</li>
