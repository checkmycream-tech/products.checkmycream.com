      <li>After I impulse-bought another bottle of Hourglass and started using it again, I remembered why I loved it so much.</li>

      <li>The first time I wore this primer, a friend asked me what I did differently with my makeup that day, because I looked nice.</li>

      <li>I highly recommend this one...</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to anyone with acne, wrinkles, or scarring.</li>
      <li>After trying so many primers I came across this one as I heard so many good things about it .It is on the expensive side that&#x27;s the only thing that sucks</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve just bought a new bottle of this primer</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fine product but not worth the money.</li>
      <li>Feels so soft!</li>
      <li>Less then  a pea sized dot is more then enough to cover the face.</li>
      <li>I have for years been trying to find a foundation that has all day coverage, that does not fade completely by the end of the day.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really think however that it makes my makeup look that different</li>
      <li>And I know the price is a bit high for primer, but my last bottle of it lasted well over 6 months.</li>
      <li>However, there&#x27;s a new problem of the scarring that my acne has left.</li>
      <li>If you still have any doubts and don&#x27;t really want to pay so much money for a product you are not sure of, try the travel size - 0.33 oz, you should get it for under 20 dollars.</li>
      <li>After spending a fortune trying every other primer on the market because I didn&#x27;t want to spend this much money on this one...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This was my first primer ever.  I bought it based on a Youtube review.  I have big pores on my nose and always had problems using foundation in that area.  This didn&#x27;t really make a difference in camouflaging them.  It does create a slightly slick surface but I didn&#x27;t think that made a difference in how the foundation look or how it was applied.  It smells nice and it didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts.  But it&#x27;s a pretty expensive product that did so little for me.</li>
    <li> I have for years been trying to find a foundation that has all day coverage, that does not fade completely by the end of the day. I have also tried other primers and they do not work either. This is truly worth every penny. My makeup (foundation , blush and eyeliner) stays on from morning to night and you do not need to use a lot of this product, so it will last a long time. I am not one to write reviews normally, but this product is worth it!</li>
    <li> Hourglass Veil primer is a must product for me. It feels so smooth and it&#x27;s a pleasure to handle it, little goes really a long way. Less then  a pea sized dot is more then enough to cover the face. It has SPF, it is water resistant, and takes care of the shine and redness.  It sinks into the skin fast and make up looks flawless. It is expensive but you really get what you pay for - a great quality primer. If you use only powder and no foundation or tinted moisturizer you should still buy it - it water proofs your powder so in the rain or humid weather the powder won&#x27;t run off your face. If you still have any doubts and don&#x27;t really want to pay so much money for a product you are not sure of, try the travel size - 0.33 oz, you should get it for under 20 dollars. You will not look back!</li>
    <li> This primer feels very pearly. I kind of like the way it feels on my face but I hate the way it feels on my hands when putting it on, and washing your hands afterward kinda doesn&#x27;t make it come off. I guess that&#x27;s a good thing because it must protect your face from water too. I don&#x27;t really think however that it makes my makeup look that different but I still use it anyways. Some other primers I have tried feel like Vaseline and this doesn&#x27;t so that&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin that&#x27;s been plagued by cystic acne for years. With extensive work and treatments I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s and thankfully it&#x27;s under control now. However, there&#x27;s a new problem of the scarring that my acne has left. Before this I was using Too Faced Primed and Poreless, which seemed to make my skin oilier at the end of the day. I&#x27;ve just bought a new bottle of this primer and I never plan on looking back. The formula is so lightweight that it seems to glide over my scars and just makes putting on my makeup a breeze. In combination with Urban Decay&#x27;s All Nighter spray, my makeup has been lasting well into the night with no new breakouts or marks. I highly recommend this to anyone with acne, wrinkles, or scarring. And I know the price is a bit high for primer, but my last bottle of it lasted well over 6 months. All you need is one pump for the entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Hourglass. You&#x27;ve made a loyal customer out of me. :3</li>
    <li> This has quickly become an HG primer for me along with OC Eight... I hate that it is so expensive but it really works... After spending a fortune trying every other primer on the market because I didn&#x27;t want to spend this much money on this one... I should have just bought this one first and saved the money... which is what I will do from now on.... I highly recommend this one...</li>
    <li> I was sold this product because I was told that it reduces redness and is \\&quot;natural\\&quot;. It&#x27;s a fine product but not worth the money. Even using sparingly it doesn&#x27;t last long. I&#x27;ll go back to Smashbox.</li>
    <li> this is the best primer i have ever used!! it feels like crushed pearls when you apply it! if your looking for the perfect primer you will hard pressed to find one that beats this!</li>
    <li> The first time I wore this primer, a friend asked me what I did differently with my makeup that day, because I looked nice. I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s when I decided I loved this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reasons I am in love with Hourglass Veil:&lt;br /&gt;- Smoothing it over my face feels like silk. It also just takes about 3/4 of a pump to cover your entire face.&lt;br /&gt;- My mineral makeup actually lasts all day when worn over this product. Since I hate reapplying, this is huge for me.&lt;br /&gt;- Shine is controlled and my T-zone is way less T-zoney.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I knew I liked this before, I didn&#x27;t repurchase after my first bottle ran out, because of the price (in this economy!?).  I tried samples that I picked up from Avon, Ulta, and Sephora, but they didn&#x27;t work as well for me, being too siliconey or just not as effective.

    <li> I have used a lot of different primers, and tried this after watching a makeup video on you tube using this, I tried it. Loved. Best ever, and only takes a little.</li>
    <li> Pretty pricey but excellent primer. The best thing is that it&#x27;s water proof so sweat will not allow makeup to was off your face. Worth the money and is very light weight</li>
    <li> After trying so many primers I came across this one as I heard so many good things about it .It is on the expensive side that&#x27;s the only thing that sucks but it does the job. I have combination skin with acne so I don&#x27;t like silicon or greasy primers ,with this I put it on my face before my makeup and it goes on so silky and smooth .and it makes my makeup last longer and gives me a very smooth finish.another thing I noticed was that it also helped my foundation from not oxidizing . Give it four stars because of its high price but I think it&#x27;s a good primer and it does the job.</li>
    <li> Makes you face feel so soft and beautiful. Put a bit on your eyelids as a primer. Nice and lightweight. Love this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best primer I&#x27;ve ever used.  It feels velvety on the skin, and is perfect for an oily complexion.</li>
    <li> This is a great primer, feels like silk on your skin, but you can find it for $20 less at sephora.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel so velvety smooth and really preps my skin for tinted moisturizer or foundation application. With SPF 15 to boot, how can you go wrong?</li>
    <li> It is very fine and smooth, feels like rubbing the pearl powder to your face. It is oil free, kind of absorbs oil, so it is good for if you have oily skin or you will apply oily foundation. I put it on top of the sunscreen containing lotion which usually very oily, and then apply the foundation.</li>
    <li> This product goes on like silk and sets immediately. No waiting before applying foundation. Awesome primer! Highly recommend this product and Sephora through Amazon,</li>
    <li> Loooooove this primer! Feels so soft! It only takes a little bit, so it last for a while! I have very oily skin and this primer really works for me!</li>
