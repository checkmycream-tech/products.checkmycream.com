<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I have long curly hair, so it gets tangled horribly. No matter how bad the tangle, this stuff always gets it out and makes it soft.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it makes my hair shine and smooth.</li>
    <li> This is really good to use once or twice a week. My hair smells wonderful, if I do say so myself, and I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Fast delivery</li>
    <li> My former beautician swears by this product and got me started on it. It really helped get my hair back in shape.</li>
    <li> I like this mask one a lot, I&#x27;m def trying the other ones from the line! thank you very much</li>
    <li> This hair mask is great everytime I use it I notice the difference inmediatly. It leaves my hair soft, smelling great and hopefully it will help my hair with all the chemical damage I&#x27;ve done with the years</li>
    <li> The best weekly conditioner I have ever tried. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This is a great deep conditioner that makes your hair shiny and conditioned without a greasy look.  I would definitely recommend this product .</li>
    <li> Makes your hair healthy! The more you use it -you will see that your damaged hair will look and feel better.Love it!</li>
    <li> excellent product that helps a lot after a straight treatment</li>
    <li> Used it today, wonderful soft hair, thank you</li>
    <li> I am African American woman with arm pit length relaxed hair. I&#x27;d been using the moroccanoil shampoo and the restorative hair mask as a deep conditioner for one year.  The product transformed and revitalized the texture of my hair. I no longer have split ends. I still use the sulfate free shampoo but have since switched to the moroccanoil intense hydrating mask, which is awesome.  I can run my fingers through my hair without any snags, my hair is shinny and very soft.  I recommend this product to anyone with hair that needs extra nourishment.  It is an excellent product!</li>
    <li> OMG, this is so great i love it, my hair stylist uses it every time i go and it leaves my hair health and i see a diff in my hair. Im doing the Dominican blowout and going natural and this is a great product for my hair. Also uses more of Moroccan oil products those are great too. When i got it in the mail it came in a good package was pleased.</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday. I do not use shampoo on my hair because it&#x27;s too drying and not really necessary. Use a small amount, about a teaspoon. Apply to hair when you first get into the shower, and rinse just before you get out.</li>
    <li> For years I searched for the right product to get my daughters relaxed, normally naturaly coarse/ mixed hair under control and stop the frizziness and dryness.&lt;br /&gt;all of the Moroccan Oil Mask are amazing . Even her hair dresser commented on it, and everyone thinks she is wearing extensions. We are so happy to have finally found a product that really makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t let the price scare you away, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for anyone who needs to add moisture and health back to especially flat ironed (daily)&lt;br /&gt;and / or relaxed african american/ or mixed texture hair .</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It smells great and leaves hair very soft and moisturized without weighing it down! Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Like the smell and shine on my hair after using the mask twice a week.</li>
    <li> I always come back to this product!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:28a836f5e2f1cf04fde6978d612ec327]]</li>
    <li> Loved it! And it got here super fast!</li>
    <li> I use the Moroccan Oil and love it, but honestly, this conditioner is just so-so.  Better options out there for the price.</li>
    <li> This hydrating mask is great! It has a wonderful smell, its very light weight &amp; it leaves the hair hydated with a nice shine and full of body.</li>
    <li> Cosmetic item arrived unsealed and very easy to open. It appeared to smell old and used. Some of the writing on the jar was erased/faded while the label on the lid looked brand new. The label on the lid didn&#x27;t fully stick on the edges, appearing as if an amateur had put it together. The cream inside had a large hole in the middle. I don&#x27;t know if that was due to the shipment. It appeared that 1/3 of the cream was missing. Next time, I will purchase from a reputable salon.</li>
    <li> Sadly, I feel this product and their shampoo do not live up to the Moroccanoil name. I bought it thinking I would like it since I use and love the Moroccan Oil Treatment oil and their Hairspray but was disappointed. No better than drugstore brands, therefore, is overpriced.</li>
    <li> I purchase products online all the time and i have never written a review but this is too good not to share. I am a repeat offender of coloring/highlights and using the straight iron, My hair hasn&#x27;t had the same shine in a while and its dry....I have tried everything on the market and always wind up looking for something else because nothing did what it claimed to do.....If this sounds anything like you and you are looking to repair damaged hair or just get shine back.. you have found the product.  After just a few uses my hair is soft, easier to style and my iron isnt getting as much use. I&#x27;ve gotten many comments that my hair looks so healthy (something i have not heard in years) this stuff is awesome, I&#x27;m hooked. cant wait to see what continued use will do!</li>
    <li> the maroocan oil products are all great.  My favorite is the oil itself which I have given as gifts to my friends and family.  This mask is hydrating without being too heavy.  The smell is terrific and the end result is silky smooth hair.  what else could one want?</li>
    <li> I like this product very much and it smells really nice.  I use it as a deep conditioner on dry hair.  I have dry, relaxed color treated hair.  I mix it with a little bit of olive oil then I moisturized my hair (no heat) for one hour then I wash it out and shampoo.  It is fabulous.  I just wish it came in a bigger size because I moisturize weekly.</li>
    <li> I recently colored my hair.  My hair went from being smooth and silky to really dry and shine-less.  This product makes my dyed hair shiny, smooth, and healthy.  Absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Moroccan oil products. If you have fine hair I recommend to comb through while rinsing to prevent greasy residue left on your scalp.</li>
    <li> I love this product. But it is too expensive to use everyday. I suggest only using it a few times a week.</li>
    <li> Makes the hair soft and easy to handle. Also smells great. And the most important thing- wasn&#x27;t tried on animals. Cruelty free!</li>
    <li> amazing! so worth the money. better than kerastase which is always top rated and twice as expensive. this makes your hair feel like silk.</li>
    <li> After years of trying several different products for my daughters hair which is relaxed and extremely dry, due to almost daily use of the flat iron,I was very skeptical of trying another product.   I have to say this is THE BEST product for any relaxed and dry hair. It was amazing after how just with one use of the Oil Intense Hydrating Mask , the oil treatment and glimmer shine spray her hair came alive.  As I read in other reviews I did not order the shampoo or the conditioner from this line , and plan on not doing so in the future. She uses the Glimmer shine spray daily with a few sprays before flat ironing and this is not only an amazing product but it smells amazing !!!!! Definitely recommend it and give it 5 stars</li>
    <li> I went from black hair to blonde hair and it really damaged my ends like nothing else! I bought this to try to revive them and keep them from splitting and breaking. I use it 2-3x a week and it&#x27;s amazing! It breathes new life to my hair. I have super oily hair but this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down *too* much. This is a treatment for dry or damaged hair so if you have oily hair, but it&#x27;s not dyed, I would say use it 1x a week or just 1x or 2x a month to see how your hair feels. I do feel like it makes my hair more manageable and less tangly. It&#x27;s way more hydrating than any other conditioner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> So far I like it has a nice smell to me, but it is expensive, I have some tips, this is what makes my hair feel wonderful, nourishing coconut milk anti breakage serum, by organix, and main and tail shampoo, it was orginaly made for horses, but it works for people to, I love that stuff, since I switch to that shampoo, my hair feels so silky.</li>
    <li> WOW! This is the best hair mask ever. I have very frizzy hair, and this mask leaves my hair sooooo smooth and managable. It&#x27;s a miracle product. The nice scent is a bonus.  I&#x27;m currently using the shampoo, conditioner, mask and oil. It gets a little expensive but sooooo worth it. I dont have to blow dry my hair anymore. I just let it air dry and if I want it straight, I&#x27;ll use a flat iron. What used to take me 1/2 hour now takes me 10 min. It&#x27;s amazing. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am a natural girl with 3c/4a curl pattern and my hair is DRY. This stuff literally goes on like butter and delivers moisture like I have never experienced in a product. I think it is definitely worth the purchase price. I also use it on my 8 year old daughters hair and you can truly see a difference. It makes your hair soft, and smells amazing. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this particular product. Definitely a staple product for my haircare regimen.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing! Not only does it leave my hair feel amazing, it also smells really good. I love using this product after I have straighten my hair and wash it the next day.  It makes my hair feel like I never damaged it. It brings the life back into my hair.  I naturally have really curly hair and used to find that whenever I straighten it then washed it, my curls were not quite the same. When I use this product it, makes my curls look like they were before I straightened them. I try to use this product at least once every 2 weeks, keeping the bounce and shine in from all the blow drying and straightening I put it through.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Morrocanoil Hydrating Styling Cream for over a year and it&#x27;s wonderful.  I decided to try the mask and all I can say is wow!  The mask is just wonderful, my hair super soft and shiny.  The order arrived in less than a week.</li>
    <li> Product works really well to give my hair the hydrating I need.      Seller got product out the door so fast and I received it sooner than I anticipated.  Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> The scent is a very caustic chemical smell which is why I think it works in making my hair smoother, but I dont recomend it and wouldnt buy it again because it reeks of formaldehyde.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Moroccanoil Hydrating Mask, and brought it in to my stylist today. After washing with the Moroccanoil Shampoo, she applied the mask for about 10 minutes....wow! We were both impressed by how soft and shiny my hair was. Although these products are pricey, I feel they are worth the price.</li>
    <li> My hair was very damaged from hair color &amp; perms. My hair was breaking off daily, dry and brittle. Within a week after using this product, I have noticed an extreme difference. The breakage has stopped and my hair texture is very soft &amp; shiney like virgin hair. I&#x27;m very impressed. Being a Woman of color, it&#x27;s very hard to find a product that works. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I think I may have got the wrong product in this line.   This hydrating mask did not do much to the condition of my hair.  I would not buy it again.   Perhaps I will try the deep conditioner next time.</li>
    <li> I arrived on before the preview day and the results of this product is amazing!</li>
    <li> I used this product on my very curly hair during some of the most humid days in July. The first time I used it my hair came out feeling smooth with very few tangles. After I dried it my hair was truly bouncing and behaving. A few weeks later I used it again (this is a treat for my hair since it is by no means inexpensive!). After following the same procedure I had more tangles when my hair was dry and lots of fly-aways. I am not sure if it was me or the product, so I tried again the first week of August on some very humid days. Tangles and fly aways again! I do like the way my hair feels after I have used it and will recommend it; however, I would like to know if I must use the associated shampoo to get the maximum effect (another treat since that, too, is not inexpensive).</li>
    <li> Excellent product, i recommend this seller!</li>
    <li> This truly is an amazing product! My hair loves it! It conditions like no other and combined with the oil treatment, that very first day my hair&#x27;s done, it looks sensational. However, for some reason the NEXT day, my ends tend to get a bit dry so I use Creme of Nature with Moroccan Oil Moisturizer and that does the trick! The combo of all these products really IS magic on my hair!!</li>
    <li> I love the Moroccanoil Intense Hydrating Mask!  I have think coarse hair, that I get relaxed. My hair was severly dry and damaged, and it brought it back to life! I use it once or twice a week. I add the Morrocain Oil Treatment to it as recommended and OMG!!     However the seller is quite pathetic! I ordered the product days ago!! But it&#x27;s still hasn&#x27;t even been shipped yet! I&#x27;ve purchased this thru another vendor before, but I thought I&#x27;d give this once a decision! Wrong decision! Yes, I will continue to buy the product! But, NEVER again from this slow poke, sit on my butt seller! X-(</li>
    <li> I just love using this mask.  I have long hair and I constantly abuse it with the blow dryer and curling iron.  This mask makes my hair feel so silky and moisturized and less guilty for all of the heat treating.  I have yet to find another mask or conditioner that works as well.  In fact, I sometimes use this as my normal conditioner on particularly heat-styled weeks and love it for that as well.</li>
    <li> I was kinda disappointed. I have AA hair and bought this after my hairdresser recommended it. I  felt that this product left my hair heavy. Not sure if I did it wrong but I&#x27;m kinda nervous to retry. It did add moisture and my hair was somewhat shinny but just felt heavy</li>
    <li> I paid extra to the quick deliver and put the adress of my hotel, but it arrived 3 days later and I was not in the hotel anymore, so I lost de order and nobody answer me. Lost $45...bad to bad..</li>
    <li> I guess it works well? didnt really notice a difference. A bit over priced and I didn&#x27;t like the smell. I wish I could pinpoint the smell to describe it better.  It&#x27;s not citrus or sweet.  Not flower-y. Kinda like an old lotion smell.. just weird</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once, but really liked it. My hair isn&#x27;t really damaged, but it can always use some help. I would recommend this to others. I took a shower and then applied more than the directed amount (because I have long hair) and then put it up in a clip and left it in for about 45 minutes. I can&#x27;t wait to use it again : )</li>
    <li> Moroccan Oil Intense Hydrating Mask is great for course thick hair. It hydrates and softens the hair leaving a wonderful scent. I have been using it for a couple of years and just bought my 21 year old niece a tub of this wonderful \\&quot;pudding\\&quot; for her hair too. A bit pricey, but the product lasts for several months if used once a week as a special treatment for your hair. I think it is worth the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a little while now, so this wasn&#x27;t my first jar. I always look for the best price, and I found it on here! This stuff is rich, thick and makes damaged, dry, frizz-prone hair like mine SO much smoother and sleek than it would be otherwise. After you use it, your hair is really sleek. I don&#x27;t use it as often as I should, (about once a week) and it still really helps. I put it on in the shower to my damp hair, and try to leave it on for 5 minutes or so. It can be left on longer and that gives it a chance to sink into hair even better. I&#x27;ve tried other brands of deep conditioners (Pureology, Joico, Goldwell, Aveda, many others) and I really like this one best. So far, it&#x27;s the one I&#x27;d recommend for hair that needs moisture and shine!</li>
    <li> I love the original moroccan oil and this product really worked for my hair. My hair has always been difficult for me to work with. It&#x27;s fine, wavy, fly-away, and has a tendency to get frizzy without the right hair products. But, if I use something too heavy or rich for my hair, it weighs it down very easily and my hair can look really greasy. That wasn&#x27;t the case when I used this product after shampooing my hair with the sulfate free, paraben free Moroccan oil shampoo. I woke up this morning and my hair is soft and hydrated. I literally can&#x27;t stop touching it. I usually apply the Moroccan oil treatment (I now use the light version because it is made for people with fine or color treated hair, so it is more liquidy and absorbs into my hair easier than the original.) and I finish off with the gold glimmer shine spray. Though this product worked for me, everyone&#x27;s hair is different. So, I suggest you give this a try. The results might not be as good if you only use one of their products. I would suggest trying the original moroccan oil treatment first and see if you like it. Then, move on to the Moroccan oil shampoo with this mask and see how it turns out.</li>
    <li> Love it! My hair is very soft and feels healthy.</li>
    <li> I received a different mask! Besides the different color and consistency, the QR code was removed! That proves the product was not original at all!</li>
    <li> I bought this from a local salon. Apparently, according to the general office in AZ, only certain salons are allowed to carry their brand. (I don&#x27;t know how Amazon sellers get it to offer it for sale.) Anyway, I bought it and tried it twice. Each time it was a total failure. I think it&#x27;s hype.  Everyone tells me my best feature is my hair. It&#x27;s very thick, luxurious, and long.  I&#x27;ve used other products and had pretty good results. However, my hair has been a bit dry lately, so I decided to purchase this since I really like the oil and the smell of thw product.  Let me tell you, it was not at all what I thought it would be.  After using it, my hair was limp (yes, I rinsed it out well enough) and my hair was also very dry even after I used this to alleviate the dryness.  A few weeks later I tried it again and had the same results.  It&#x27;s not worth it.  Perhaps the conditioner is better. The shampoo is no big deal either -- I can&#x27;t see the difference between it and other shampoos except for the odor which is delicious. (But the delightful odor in the hair gets rinsed out anyway.)  I undersand there is no alcohol in it to dry out the hair, but their are chemicals and I&#x27;m no chemist but I was told the product was natural -- I guess chemicals fall under the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; catagory?  So I would not waste my money on this particular one again, but will continue to purchase the Moroccan oil.  Be careful at beauty supply outets. They claim their Moroccan Oil is the same product and does the same job, but it is far from it. Look for the real markings: not the look-alike markings and colors on the bottles they sell at places that claim it is the real thing.</li>
    <li> This is a very thick and oily mask that helps to nourish the hair and it does a great job. My wife&#x27;s hair was badly damaged in a salon by improper coloring and this hydrating mask with the repair shampoo was the only thing that brought her hair back to life. After a month of treatment, it is almost 100% back to normal. Her new stylist recommended this to try to salvage her hair and it worked perfectly. Expensive but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I spent a lot of money on the shampoo, conditioner, mask, and curling creme.  After three months of weekly use of the mask (and daily of all else), my 2b/3a hair is curlier but still looks like a \\&quot;before\\&quot; picture -- frizz all over.  I&#x27;m not a fan of using dimethicone on my hair (based on principles), and I&#x27;m still not a fan based on results.</li>
    <li> I have never had better hair because of this product.  It leaves my hair feeling like silk!</li>
    <li> This product is fake!!! I have never written a review before, but this really made me mad. I thought it was a good deal because it is twenty dollars less than what I paid at the salon. The color and consistency are not even close. It smells the same and comes in the same container - that&#x27;s it!! I&#x27;m not sure how they pull this off, but if you want real Moroccan Oil ptoducts, don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
    <li> Great smell, great results.My daughter-in-law introduced me to the product. I now understand why some call it \\&quot;crack for hair\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s hard to stop using it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!!  I&#x27;m in the process of transitioning from relaxed to natural,  and it leaves BOTH textures soooo soft and shiny. I decided to purchase the smaller bottles just to &amp;#34;try out&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;ve gone through the entire hair care line (shampoo, mask, and leave-in oil) and I absolutely love it!!! It&#x27;s a must that I invest in the larger bottles.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product for any hair type! My hair was over processed and breaking from being bleached and it brought it back to life! My roommate also uses this product for her unbleached hair and she loves it as well.</li>
    <li> really good, i like it.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve found for my very dry hair.  As someone who&#x27;s tried a lot of products, this is the best by far.  Disclaimer: I used this product after shampooing my hair with the Moroccan Oil Moisture Repair Shampoo so I&#x27;m sure that the result may have been enhanced.  But like most lines of products, they probably are designed to perform at optimal level when used together.  My hair was shinier than ever, and this is right after I rinsed and towel dried!  I honestly have not had soft and shiny hair like this in years.  The smell is different, but it didn&#x27;t bother me.  I&#x27;ve used many different Aveda products with very prominent smells, so for me this was similar.    I&#x27;m a fan of this line of products.  Definitely solved my issues with dry and damaged hair.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent to hidrating</li>
    <li> After having fantastic results from using the Moroccan Oil, I couldn&#x27;t resist giving this hair mask a go. Unfortunately, this mask turned out to be very average. This is one of those cult beauty products that women rave about. However, I didn&#x27;t have any spectacular results. It did make my hair smell good. However, I saw little to no improvement in the softness or shine of my hair. This product is vastly inferior to the Moroccan Oil. The one good thing I can say about this product is that it did not weigh my hair down at all, which is the plus. Before you buy this product, do your research into other hair masks.</li>
    <li> Good price; the product works fine:</li>
    <li> I bought this product after alot of research I watch videos on Youtube and read plenty of reviews I had bought the moroccanoil and I love it but this product really disappointed me I Followed the directions step by step and the finish product was Horrible so Horrible that I had to wash it out the folllowing day because it wasnt really my hair that was dry it was my scalp I would not reccomend this product at all!!!</li>
    <li> I did not buy mine from Amazon and after reading someone else&#x27;s review about Amazon not having rights to sell this product I will go back to the same store as before. This product has a pleasant smell first of all and I often use the sauna when I put it on my hair dry then wash and shampoo, or leave overnight before shampooing. My hair is drie and damaged from heat and coloring but after I started using Moroccan oil intense hydration I can see significant improvement and my hair looks great and feels soft for several days, I am very pleased with result, I no longer need to use hair conditioner after shampoo, although I do still use leave in conditioner on occasion.</li>
    <li> Made my hair healthy- Gave my hair the moisture it needed.</li>
    <li> The Moroccanoil hydrating mask is awesome!  I have lots of fine, curly hair and this product makes it soft, manageable and shiny without weighing it down.  It&#x27;s really easy to use as it only takes about five minutes (or less) to achieve a great result. The smell is light, fresh and WONDERFUL!  In between shampoos, I put a small amount in an atomizer, mix with water and have a great treatment spray that adds wonderful shine and manageability that does NOT weigh my hair down at all.  In fact, it seems to add some volume!  This product is perfect. Especially the fragrance. LOVE IT!  P.s.  I use the atomizer with the product on my face too.</li>
    <li> I have only used it once but I like it a lot. I need to use it again. thanks for the reminder!!!</li>
    <li> Im a hair product junkie and Ive done everything to my hair from perming to straightening, color, highlights, and then back to color again as I feel like it. And the only conditioner that works as well as this is NONE!! Moroccan Oil Intense Hydrating Mask is the BEST, hands down!! Get the 16oz and it will last you longer. I just skim a bit off the top and youre golden! Leave it in while you shave your legs and...what ever, when you wash it out its as soft as silk.      ____  Also, just a side note, I donated my hair about 2 years ago and have been growing it out ever since and it seems to have grown like a weed by using M.O. products. We use the hydrading mask, intense curl cream, shine spray, and of course the actual moroccan oil in my house. I have super sensitive skin and I notice that I dont break out from using these products, but the mask can be heavy, so I wear my hair up at night and wash my hair at least 2x/wk. Since the 2 years, my hair has grown at least 2 feet, I get it cut frequently and loose about 4 inches every quarter, so...yeah, use this product if youre trying to grow your hair out ladies!! Cheers to sexy beautiful hair!!</li>
    <li> Good product. Works great and smells so good. Good price.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product to use for dry and damaged hair.  After having my hair over processed by my stylist, this is the one product that has helped restore my hair.  Would highly recommend for any type of damaged hair.</li>
    <li> Hi! It arrived earlier than scheduled which was so great!   This dealer is great and I recommend them! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Works great on my hair!</li>
    <li> This product is great to repair damaged and dry hair. Even if you don&#x27;t have either, using once every 2 weeks would do a great job. The smell is amazing and I love using it weekly.</li>
    <li> I originally was able to try this product in the beauty Solon I wanted to take a jar home but, the cost was over $65.&lt;br /&gt;I saved a great deal of money ordering on Amazon so I grabbed a jar. I have done 3 treatments and my sun blown, bleach&lt;br /&gt;hair seams to have a more hydrating appearance.</li>
    <li> This mask, mixed with the intense moisture repair conditioner works great. I&#x27;m not sure which of the products works best, or if it&#x27;s the duo together, but my hair LOVES this brand. I like how their are no sulfites, parabens, or other harsh ingredients in this line. I have slightly frizzy (due to coloring), medium thick, middle of my back length hair. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use anything else. This helps cut the frizz and makes my hair really soft. Great price on amazon compared to salon prices!</li>
    <li> This is the best treatment, I have compared with others, Aveeda, L´Oreal, etc, and this really really made my hair shiny, soft and smells wonderful.  I sometimes leave it through the night and rinse the next morning and it becomes incredibly soft, I won´t change it for anything, so worth it!</li>
    <li> My hair was so damaged by a perm gone crazy and this product has made a difference in the shine and it is more controllable.</li>
    <li> I am very hard on my hair.  I love to change up the color all the time, so my hair can sometimes get very dried out.  I bit the bullet and paid more than I normally would for a hair product, but I&#x27;m so glad I did!  After just the first use my hair felt brand new!  I continued to use it once a week for a couple weeks and now my hair is like silk!  It is so smooth and manageable!  My ends are so much more hydrated and look way better than they did a month ago!  This is a great product and way worth the money!</li>
    <li> I love this mask. I have course, bleached and overall pretty damaged long hair. I am a double process diva. My hair was not benefiting from this. Going from dark brunette to sunny gold blonde was great in theory, but my ends were shot and frizzy. My stylist sold me on this mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it one time as a mask and didn&#x27;t blow dry. I was not sure about it, seemed a bit greasy and heavy. My hair didn&#x27;t look so cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it again as more of a \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot; just a tiny bit and combed it through my ends and then waited about 3 mins and rinsed. Blow dried with a paddle brush and my hair looks amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously. This looks and feels better than a professional blowout. I am so so so sold.</li>
    <li> Dry and coarse hair is now soft and fluffy!  All the curl came back once I washed my hair in the shower, put on the Moroccan Oil Mask and then slipped a shower cap over it for really only about 5 minutes.  It is cold weather here now as it is Winter, and all the curl has gone from my hair and turned it more coarse and dry than my normally gray hair is.  Wow!  I am leaving this on longer next time, because if it does this well with 5 minutes what will it do with 10?  I love this stuff!!!!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing line of products.  The product not only works very well, it does exactly what it claims, and the scent is sooooo nice.</li>
    <li> Love! Makes my hair thick and lovely. I have very thin hair and I went from black to blonde. This makes my hair look like a million bucks. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I have thick, often dry hair and I also color it frequently. I recently lightened my hair from red to blonde and this has saved it&#x27;s life! My hair is so soft and shiny! I don&#x27;t use it very often, just once a week and it last a long time.</li>
    <li> Use with damp hair and arrived with appropriate packaging. Will repurchase in the near future.. I have 3b-3c curly hair.</li>
    <li> luv this stuff, i usually leave it in my hair for at least an hour and sometimes longer, it really softens my hair</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, especially on grey hair.  I would but it again, but I won&#x27;t do any more surveys</li>
    <li> I put this on my hair before putting on my bathing cap to swim laps.  Protects my color treated hair from chemicals in the pool water.  Also makes putting my cap on easier as it slicks back all the hair around my face that is hard to get underneath the cap.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> I use it for 2 weeks and I love it more and more every day! My hair become shine and good smell</li>
    <li> I like this product but my wife a little less so.  She feels it dries her hair out, but it doesn&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I just love it. I used it once and could see a major improvement in my hair, it felt soft and nice. definitely recommend!!!</li>
    <li> It hydratimg and. Great styler after blown dry hair is easiest and works best. I leave mine in all day.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a product good for the skin and hair and to keep it hydrated for over a lengthy periods of time. This awesome product works great with the oil, and shampoo and conditioner and it leaves your hair smelling so great for weeks.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best hair products out there, I have tried several differet hair mask over the years and this is one of my top ones. I love it and it has a great smell.</li>
    <li> I should&#x27;ve listened to the other reviews claiming the product is fake or old. I have purchased this product three other times and this is the only time it has been different. The smell is completely off and it is like sticking your hand in butter or crisco. It is normally a nice tropical scent and the product is so soft and silky. They shrink wrap it with a label suggesting you cannot return once you remove the shrink wrap. I will be making a complaint to Amazon for my money back. This product is either fake or extremely old. Do not buy this product. It is a bad representation of the actual product. The seller was U B U Beauty.</li>
    <li> I use it all the time at Bikram yoga and it makes my hair feel like silk afterward. Recommend puttting it on and sitting in a hot room anywhere - beach ,etc. Great results</li>
    <li> Best mask I will ever purchase and I&#x27;ve tried almost everything and this is the only hair treatment that I can use for both my curly and straight hair. It leaves my hair supper soft and hydrated this mask is a must have if you&#x27;ve recently or are planning to do any type of chemical service works even better when you use there Moroccan oil as a leave in.</li>
    <li> A gift for my daughter for Christmas, part of the package. If it&#x27;s as good as the oil then it will be excellent.</li>
    <li> I admit it...I&#x27;m in love with this product. I have very long, very thick, and very bleached hair that takes quite a beating from both the bleach and hot irons. Before I had MAJOR breakage products (seriously, it began to look like I had a 3rd grade boy&#x27;s bowl cut from the incessant breakage around the crown). I knew I had to change, but wasn&#x27;t quite ready to give up the platinum. This is where Moroccan Oil products come in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I threw out and said &amp;#34;buh-bye!&amp;#34; to my store bought shampoos and conditioners which had lots of alchol and sulfates in them, and switched to this product line. It can be expensive, but it&#x27;s worth it. Your hair feels amazing after using it, and I&#x27;ve gotten incredible results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s how I fixed my hair: Forget regular conditioners. I use this intensifying mask in leiu of conditioners. It&#x27;s VERY thick, and atfer shampooing I leave it on for about 5 minutes in the shower while shaving. As soon as you rinse it out your hair feels softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twice a week I will towel dry my hair a bit, coat my hair with this product, wrap/tie a towel around my head (or use a shower cap) and sleep in it, allowing it to fully penetrate the shaft. I don&#x27;t shampoo it out, just rinse with water, and the softness is incredible. My hair used to look (and feel) like straw. Every stylist I have gone to in the past year have commented they cannot believe what amazing condition my hair is for being so long and bleached. I no longer have breakage, and I no longer have to wear extensions. It&#x27;s now naturally the length my extensions were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is prone to tangles. I also have a six year old daughter with medium length hair, and after a day at school and recess on the playground, she will come home with major knots. I use this as conditioner and it makes the BEST detangler EVER. Leave it on for a few minutes, and you barely have to navigate the knots- they come out on their own. Nothing else compares for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could give it more than five stars- but what I can do is give my heartfelt, sincere recommendation of this product, wheter you&#x27;re just looking for a good conditioner, attempting to get healthy hair back, or need a miracle way to detangle hair. This does it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the smell is divine!</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! There are different ways to use it though and that determines your outcome. Have you ever tried using coconut oil with it? Its absolutely amazing!!! I have waist length extremely dry (Normally) extremely curly hair and I actually love this product. Not the first couple times I used it however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do is put it in and put a shower cap on and take a towel out of the dryer and wrap it around my head.  I do this or I sleep with a shower cap on and rinse it out in the morning. Sometimes I add coconut oil with it to my ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key is when I rinse it out is I use lukewarm closer to cool water and I DO NOT comb it again. Then I use Modern Organic Products Leave in Conditioner [[ASIN:B0016FVJQC MOP Leave- In Conditioner Unisex, 6.76 Ounce]]and let my hair air dry after applying and do not touch it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I started doing this I get complements on my hair almost daily!! Also I use a non-lathering, sulfate free shampoo (DevaCurl No Poo)[[ASIN:B000TKF15A DevaCare Cleanser, No-Poo, 32-Ounce Bottle]] and that has completely changed the texture of my hair:-)</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner mask. It makes your hair looks healthier and I love love the smell of it. As a professional I would definitely recommend it to every one who has over-processed, dry or damaged hair. You don&#x27;t need to leave it more than 10 minutes, it does a great job.</li>
    <li> I use this product 2 - 3 times in a week. I&#x27;m very happy with the results. My hair looks healthy and shiny. I&#x27;ll continue buying these products. They&#x27;re great!!</li>
    <li> This product is good, it makes my hair soft and manageable but I have tried many products in the market that gave me exactly the same effect with less price like zero frizz, I will not purchase it again as it didn&#x27;t give me better results compared to other products with less price. I tried the oil and its great and I love it but this mask wasn’t as expected. May be if it is with a lower price I would buy it again and recommend it but it doesn’t worth the money spent on it.</li>
    <li> Moroccan Oil is a great product for damaged hair. However way too pricy! I&#x27;m going back to another hydrating product which is much cheaper.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product and how quickly I received it.</li>
    <li> Moroccan Oil Intense Hydrating Mask is without a doubt the best treatment for your hair, ever.  My hair is very dry from coloring and 99% gray (underneath all that two color process) so I needed something that would give me smooth, manageable, gorgeous hair.  I use the heavenly scented hydrating mask once a week as a treatment - leave on 10 minutes and rinse.  There is nothing left but soft, well-conditioned hair - no oily residue that will weigh the hair down.  I use it as a sleep-in treatment once a month.  My hair feels great now and doesn&#x27;t ever look dry or over-processed.  I was ready to stop coloring altogether until my stylist used this product on my hair.  It also is a treat for your hands when applying to your hair!</li>
    <li> My hair is super long and gets tangled up after every shower. Using this product has made my hair silky smooth and easy to comb through. Love it!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product but I just can&#x27;t use it because the fragrance is so strong that it gives me a headache. This is unfortunate because of how much I paid for it and I can&#x27;t return it. I would have given it only one star but it does make my hair feel nice, but the scent it so strong and lasts for days so every time I move my head I can smell it so I have an almost constant headache for a week straight.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!! It is one of the best out there...I do not think I will use another mask :)</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff. My hair was really dry and frizzy due to blow drying and straightening it all the time. The first time I used it, I noticed a difference right away. I have thick, wavy hair that&#x27;s usually pretty poofy and frizzy but it made it SO soft and silky, this is the softest my hair has ever felt. It&#x27;s kind of expensive but most definitely worth it!!</li>
    <li> I have to say this product is a decent product.  Probably worthy of at least giving it a try.  It left my hair softer with less tangles although it might add a tiny bit of weight to it, it isn&#x27;t enough to dissuade me from buying the product.  What IS enough to make me not want to buy it is the packaging.  This jar was NOT thought through very well.  Sure it&#x27;s different and chic but try opening a WIDE lid with little to no grip in the shower with wet hands. 40% of the time I have to grab a towel or washcloth to get a grip.  And once opened you are left with a huge jar in one hand and the lid balancing between fingers scooping out the product with the other hand.  The fact that I haven&#x27;t dropped this during use is a miracle!!  Once open the cream is exposed to water getting in it.  It is just plain awkward to say the least.  Not to mention the jar seems to take up a lot of room on the narrow ledges or shelf inside my shower.  So until they make some sort of flip lid or smaller opening I think the effects this mask gives is not worth the risk of spilling it.</li>
    <li> wow... makes my hair so soft and beautiful!! highly recommend. I have very long and extremly thick hair whick i color every 8wks and this is a miracle worker...</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product, though it is heavy for fine hair. Next time I will pay closer attention, but I would recommed this product!</li>
    <li> Plan to reorder, helps with split end and adds shine!&lt;br /&gt;Also has nice scent, very good product. I highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;for damage hair.</li>
    <li> This item leaves my hair soft and smooth, I like it a lot</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many conditioners in my life that are both more expensive and less. None can compare to how my hair feels after using this. I have thick, long wavy hair if that matters.</li>
    <li> Been using for last few years to tame my frizzy, kinky hair into manageable, silky curls.  Use once a week---leave in 5-10 minutes.  Longer if I have time.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  It is awesome.  It really makes a difference in my hair.  I have used a lot of products and have problematic hair and this is really impressive.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mask now for almost 6 months.  I use it every time I wash my hair.  I wash my hair then put the mask on all over cover my head with a plastic bag (It looks terrific, for sure) and leave it on for about 30 min. depending on what I am doing.&lt;br /&gt;Then, rinse off, blow dry and straighten.  Hair turns out silky and smooth,  I also use Living Proof styling cream.  Love the results,</li>
    <li> I have no reason to believe this isn&#x27;t an authentic product as mentioned by some other reviewers. So far I think it&#x27;s great and I&#x27;ve used it twice. My only two problems are the tape that was used to seal the container of the mask has lifted off the label letters from the side of the product, thus making it hard to read the instructions. Also, the product states on the top that it&#x27;s for medium/thick hair. I don&#x27;t remember this being mentioned in the product description, if it is there, I missed it. My hair is very fine but even so, this does not weigh it down too heavy.</li>
    <li> This winter my normally oily hair decided to stay oily at the scalp but become very dry and lifeless on the ends. An attractive combination, I know. Enter Moroccanoil products... I use the hydrating masque as my conditioner every time I shampoo. I also use the Moroccanoil hair treatment with every shampoo (on damp hair prior to drying). I also sometimes put some oil on the ends of my hair when it&#x27;s dry. It makes it soft, shiny and smell oh so good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read so much about Morrocanoil, but am dissapointed with the line. I found this to be drying, not moisturizing. I find this line to be overpriced. You can get better results from a product at the drugstore. but the fragrance is wonderful.</li>
    <li> While the price point is high for conditioner, I felt like it was worth it. It starts to work instantly.</li>
    <li> meh~ results not as great as i&#x27;d hope. i love the smell though</li>
    <li> Love this product! It is very thick and smells great but your hair smells so good after you style it everyone notices.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and cannit live without it. I have super thick hair and it leaves it silky and healthy!!</li>
    <li> Really nourishes and hydrates hair. Great smell!</li>
    <li> First I&#x27;ll say from what I heard of this project my expectations were set high. I thought it would be better. It smells amazing, so I think and the smell of it stays in your hair for a few days which I loved. I may need to use it a bit more honestly before I judge it but from using it so far I&#x27;d say it works well, but not a miracle in a jar. From reviews and things I&#x27;d heard of the product using it just a few times and your hair would be amazing! Certainly when you put it in, in makes your hair feel great. My hair was so easy to manage the first day and pretty shiny, also so soft, much more than normal. But it didn&#x27;t hold up as much then when I started styling my hair. I happened to straighten my hair the first day and it lost some of the shine from the product, and my hair ended up being a bit frizzy then. Maybe you shouldn&#x27;t straighten your hair with it, I&#x27;m not sure, but with my hair type... my hair looked great with just with product in but my hair goes every which way and won&#x27;t go straight at all unless I straighten it. Overall I still think it&#x27;s a good product and will continue to use it, however it&#x27;s a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> Use any other mask from the drug store and it does the same. I can&#x27;t stand when people make a hype about a product. It is just the name and idea which boosts the price up.</li>
    <li> This conditioner works great. I use it once a week. I have extremely touch hair that gets dried out and frizzy in the winter. I love the smell of this product as well.</li>
    <li> My hair never felt better this product mad my hair soft, bouncy and just beautiful without having to put greese in it....my hair never looked and felt this good without going to the hair dresser.....</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick long hair (blonde too) and we recently moved to a rural area with hard water.  The hard water did a number on my hair, after purchasing the best water softner I was looking for anything to hydrate my really dry hair.  I have been struggling with split ends and dry hair, after reading the reviews I decided to try this product.  I really like it, my hair was soft and manageable and it smelled great.  The only negative was the shipping, when it arrived it container was shattered and the product was all over inside the package.  It appeared that a larger heavier package had crushed it or it was dropped while cold or something.  I contacted the company but would have had to ship it back and packaging and they talked like they would possibly replace it.  I decided to pick out the broken pieces and just use it, rather than going through all the work of sending it back.  I would order it again, but I think they should package it in a box not an envelope.  If it wasn&#x27;t for the shipping I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars.  I have purchased expensive hair conditioners from places like ulta or sophia and this is much better.</li>
    <li> First off I love the smell and I love how silky it makes your hair feel. Don&#x27;t put a ton on your hair, for a little goes along way! You don&#x27;t want to weigh down your hair too much! :)</li>
    <li> Love this product! I use it once every three to four weeks. It makes my hair so soft and silky and helps with frizz control without weighing it down. This makes my list of products I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
    <li> I purchase this oil treatment, because I have been loving with this brand&#x27;s hair oil, and it is so good with quality and smell. The treatment also doesn&#x27;t make me disappointed, good product,</li>
    <li> Great product to use weekly for hydration. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The product has a great reputation but I haven&#x27;t seen a noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Smells good, and most importantly makes my hair look amazing! Does not seem like a dupe. I&#x27;ve had this product before.</li>
    <li> You can rescue hair damage from the first use of this product. A little goes a long way and worth every penny</li>
    <li> Seems to be working - my hair is actually over-moisturized to the point where I&#x27;ve had to up my protein treatment.</li>
    <li> As an African American woman, Morocco Oil Intense Hydrating conditioner does a good job on my natural, color - treated hair.</li>
    <li> I used it years ago and started again when I was reminded about it recently.  I had gotten a service done at the W Hotel and the staff were selling this to me, but I realize I could get it much less on Amazon - and so I did!  I use this product once or twice a week.  I shampoo, rinse, then add this magical stuff and leave on for about 5 minutes in the steam shower.  My hair tends to be on the dry side, but I have a lot of it, so this stuff makes it nice, smooth, and tamed.  And I love the smell.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> I loved this product and delivery was perfect! My hair was wonderful and very soft. Exactly what I have read in the specifications.</li>
    <li> this mask really hydrates your hair, it leaves your hair like silk</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this product because I heard alot of great things. However, the company I made the purchase from made me a little skeptical. The shipment came fairly quick so there is no complaint in that. Once I got the product in my hands, it appeard to have been tampered with. Now mind you, the prouct arrived upside down, so im sure the product settled while being shipped.However, it just seemed as if alot less was in the container than what should have been. The bad part is, the conainer had no outside packaging, only what was packaged by the shipper, so I have no way of knowing whether it was tampered with or not!!!!</li>
    <li> Works well to soften and smooth my dry over processed hair ends. Great scent too.</li>
    <li> I can grow, and maintain my long hair with this product. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This an excellent product, all conditioners should be so good.  Hope it is never discontinued.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Moroccan Oil products &amp; you can read about their many benefits in the other reviews. The point I want to make is that according to a rep at the company, Amazon is not authorized to sell their products &amp; therefore these might be fakes. Specifically, the rep claims that the ingredient list for this product differs from that of their authentic product. Most worrying is that this product being sold on Amazon contains cancer-causing parabens. I know it&#x27;s tempting to jump on a good deal &amp; it&#x27;s convenient to use Amazon but to be on the safe side, I would avoid buying Moroccan Oil products through this channel.</li>
    <li> Works well and even use small amounts on my hair when it is dry mixing it with a little of the oil.</li>
    <li> excellent product for dry hair</li>
    <li> Awesome product, very good quality!! I would totally recommend this one! You can use the shamppo from the same brand or get your own shampoo and still is pretty good!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I wish it was cheaper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it once or twice a week and really let it soak in. it definitely helps my hair. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I have dry brittle bleached hair and usually cannot get a brush through it when it is wet. I used this mask and let it sit on my hair for a good 20 minutes. After I washed it, my hair was smooth and super manageable. Only reason I gave four stars is because its a little heavy for my thin hair, so it weighs it down a tad. But it WORKS!!! Does exactly what it says it will do!</li>
    <li> It was very hydrating, my hair is damaged due to coloring and daily heat styling. I typically apply the mask and sit in the steam room, seems to give me great results</li>
    <li> It was not the original Moroccan oil  intense hydrating it was something really bad does not have the ingredience or the right smile its something made in China very very cheap quilty and I don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone and I lost my money .</li>
    <li> It just made my hair so soft, shiny and healthy. I recommend it, 100% and definitely will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s brought a sensational hydration to my hair.  Since the first time I tried it, I can see the difference</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking it might be an intense mask for my very thick, course hair.  Pretty disappointing product.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d be great for someone with thinner hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered this online because the price is so much better than in a salon. Great product for over treated hair. I have straight hair and still have body using this product line.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I got introduced to the Moroccan oil products by my hair dresser. I now have the volumizing shampoo and conditioner and the root pump. I have naturally frizzy and dull hair and controlling the frizz has been a lifelong battle for me. I use the intense hydrating mask about twice a week in the shower and leave it on for 5-10 min. It smells amazing. I noticed an immediate difference in my hair. It was a lot softer, shiner, and less frizzy instantly after I blow dried it. For my hair, the effects last about 3 days and it is time for me to use it again. I have been been using it long enough to really feel the effects of it repairing my hair, but for now I love it and will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Fast;  cheapest; as described; no problems</li>
    <li> Good product as expected, have not been able to see results yet</li>
    <li> wife absolutely loves this. will not buy anything else. i am glad i found the big size bottle. a lot easier ont he wallet.</li>
    <li> this product does wonders for your hair.  this is my second jar and already I am hooked.  I&#x27;ve tried my products over the past 40 years and this by far out ways them all.</li>
    <li> I am currently deployed and the water is less than favorable! I have kinky, curly, unruly, natural hair and this brings it back to life every time. I don&#x27;t know what my hair would be without it right now!</li>
    <li> leaves hair shiny and soft. Smells amazing. This size lasts for a long time since the instructions say to use once a week only.</li>
    <li> I typically use this product twice a week on my colored hair.  Love how it leaves my hair soft and smooth.  Great stuff and worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have the ombré effect, my ends are really dry. Makes my hair softer. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far.</li>
    <li> Like all Moroccan products, it smells wonderful.  I have long hair and I  like to use this about every two weeks.</li>
    <li> This cream is the best, I love it... Every other week I was my hair and leave the cream on for 30 min and the hair looks AMAZING... Good price.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> Não gosto do cheiro, mas, hidrata bastante o cabelo.</li>
    <li> Works beautifully to get rid of dry frizzies, especially if you do a light mask on your towel-dried hair and leave it in overnight.</li>
    <li> my favorite hair mask.  I have relaxed, colored hair and this is excellent, I leave it on when I work out or do hot yoga so my hair doesn&#x27;t dry out. good price, received the product quickly. happy</li>
    <li> I have coarse, unrelaxed, Afr Am hair.  My dermatologist recommended this b/c my hair gets so brittle and does not respond to most products.  This stuff is very moisturizing and helps better than just about any other product I&#x27;ve used.  The smell is a bit odd but it doesnt hang around for long and it is a small sacrifice to pay for such a moisturizing product.  Additionally, I get brazilian keratin treatments and this works well along w/it b/c it does not have sulfates or salt.</li>
    <li> I ordered this so that it would get here soon after I had my hair colored, as I had read that it is good for color-treated hair. I love a natural product, and use argan oil on my face &amp; body so I was excited to try this mask. While not 100% natural (it doesn&#x27;t claim to be), I am happy to say that this stuff works wonders for me. I took a gamble and it paid off. I&#x27;ve used it twice now and my hair is soft, not at all greasy, and actually does have body. I think if you rinse very well you won&#x27;t get that heavy feeling others have complained of. My hair is fine but I have a lot of it; I would not hesitate to even use this every day, and I don&#x27;t really think it is necessary to also use their shampoo. I alternate between two LUSH shampoos - Godiva and Reincarnate - and this works great with either of them. It has a clean, fresh and alluring fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have also complained of silicones and other \\&quot;non-natural\\&quot; things in the ingredient list. In the case of this conditioner, I really don&#x27;t have a problem with that because this is so obviously a quality product. My skin is not sloughing off and my hair is not falling out, and I do not feel poisoned from using this. You&#x27;ll surely end up with worse things than this in your hair if you live in a large city (smog, etc.)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: If you have hair like mine and want it to look, feel and smell good &amp; healthy, then you&#x27;ve nothing to lose by trying Moroccanoil Intense Hydrating Mask.</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect - living in Las Vegas, my hair gets very dry. The Moroccan Oil Hydrating Mask is exactly what my hair needed.&lt;br /&gt;I just add a small tbsp full after I shampoo to my damp towel dried hair, clip it up, add a cap - to keep the heat of my scalp in,&lt;br /&gt;and I leave it in for about ~15 min. then I rinse it out &amp; go. Leaves my hair feeling soft for the weekends :)</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!  This is one of the best moisturizers and conditioners for hair!</li>
    <li> it does a great job on moisture and the smell is awesome but the price is a little steep but overall this is a great product</li>
    <li> My hair was falling out, and was super thin. I&#x27;ve been using this product for two months now - and wow! My hair looks fuller and is growing super fast!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen people commenting on that mask and I wanted to try it. My hair is dry, I normally use Argan mask and pay normally about 10$... So I bought that Moroccan mask and it come  with the barcode scratched and pulled off for some reason ... I didn&#x27;t like it as I felt it was fake or violated  product but I choose to use it to try. My hair got soft but nothing extraordinary, I get the same result by using the Argan Oil mask!&lt;br /&gt;Never going to buy it  again from that shop!</li>
    <li> If you want your hair to feel smooth and soft by this product!  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great &amp; makes my hair smell amazing.</li>
    <li> Great smell leaves the hair smelling magnificent. As for the intense hydrating i am still waiting for it to happen.</li>
    <li> This is the best product if you have frizzy hair.  I use it with the Moroccan oil after my shower and my hair is wonderful!!!</li>
    <li> Everything great as always.</li>
    <li> My hair tends to become frizzy if I don&#x27;t put the right kind of product in it. After two weeks of using this Oil, I could even stop using my conditioner because my hair felt very soft and was a lot less frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;I usually also apply a teaspoon of Moroccan Oil Intense Curl Cream before I dry my hair (always with a diffuser, of course), and it looks great. Quite frankly, I tried so many different products for my hair before I purchased this one, and none gave me the same results.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it to anyone with coarse wavy/curly hair!</li>
    <li> Great product,  I love every product I have tried with this brand. I received a sample of the Moroccan Oil at a Holiday Mart and I have been hooked since. I love their products…...</li>
    <li> I have colored aging hair and this product brings it to life without any heavy weigh down. At rinse out I leave some in my hair and skip any additional conditioning before comb out.</li>
    <li> This mask is great for hair that has been treated with color. At least in my case I was recommended to use it after some highlights went wrong and my hair texture was like hay.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this as a conditioner in a very small amount after I wash my hair and after a week of using it,my hair is softer,and much less frizzy than before using it.&lt;br /&gt;Also I noticed that the shine in my hair is back and my color lasts longer. Blow drying is taking longer (meaning that the hair is hydrated) so that&#x27;s a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using it along with other moroccan oil products.&lt;br /&gt;Is a bit pricey,but girls,the performance of this mask on damaged hair is fenomenal and it&#x27;s very high quality.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have permed hair with a short pixie cut. I find that when my hair is better moisturized it is much easier to mold and style. My hair comes out super soft after being styled making my cut manageable.</li>
    <li> Bought this from my hairdresser, I love it. It does need to stay on for a bit and rinse, but use 2xs a week and your hair is sooo nice and soft. Did use this 2 weeks before my wedding and my hair was in great condition for the occasion. Too bad they dont have it in JUMBO size. But its worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have tried many generic products and by far the best I&#x27;ve tried yet. Leaves hair soft, hydrated and smelling good.</li>
    <li> Immediate results and shine. When I use this my hair gets less frizzy in rain and humidity. Just don&#x27;t use too much. You only need a little so it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I use this mask about once a week along with other products in this line such as the oil treatment, shine spray, and hydrating styling cream. My hair is naturally dry and have tried other hydrating products but they tend to weigh my hair down but these products do just the opposite.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff. I bought at the recommendation of The Pioneer Woman and it does exactly what she said it would. Soft, healthy, salon feel, non frizzy hair! I feel like I have my 20 something hair back And the smell is a throw back to my favorite 70&#x27;s shampoo.</li>
    <li> I use this regularly &amp; have noticed astounding results.</li>
    <li> When the moroccan oil line first came out, I had to try this! I love the oil and wanted to see even more results by using this. Right after I use it, my hair looks amazing! I can comb right through it, and it feels so silky, but by the next morning my hair feels exactly the same as before I had used the mask. I like it for the immediate results, but as far as long term it didn&#x27;t impress me. I think I could find a way cheaper alternative.</li>
    <li> I used this after washing my hair at night. I tied a bandana around my hair and slept with it on (my hair was very dry). The next morning when I rinsed it out it was like silk, I noticed an immediate change. I already have been telling my friends about it - you should try it!</li>
    <li> Great, but over priced</li>
    <li> I really like this mask, but I can understand why it&#x27;s not for everyone. I have naturally long, silky hair and I was looking for a mask that would me keep it that way. My hair was starting to become dry this winter and was also curling up. This mask adds body and weight to help to keep my hair heavy, straight and voluptuous. I try to keep it on for several hours or overnight in the weekends for a deeper treatment. I also love the smell.</li>
    <li> Love this!  Made my hair feel A LOT softer and silkier on the first try. My stylist said not to use it too often though as protein may ultimately make the hair feel drier down the road. So I use it occasionally.</li>
    <li> Great product, I&#x27;ve been using it for the first time and I&#x27;m very satisfied. I will definitely buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> Not work well as it always does.</li>
    <li> I would always see product in People Style Watch &amp; think \\&quot;hmmm...if Eva Mendez uses it, then someone is probably paying her to say these positive things!\\&quot; Yeah, no-- best s*** ever.    My hair is naturally very, very dark (I&#x27;m half Asian). And like most girls, I like to make my hair a color that is virtually impossible to attain without the help of bleach &amp; a long visit to a hair salon. Since I&#x27;ve joined the exclusive group of \\&quot;blonde Asians,\\&quot; (blasian for short) my hair is suuuuuper dry &amp; brittle, so I needed nothing short of a miracle to make my misleading locks not look like that billow pad that&#x27;s been in your kitchen sink for 4 years longer than recommended.    A gift from God himself, this moroccan oil made my mane soft, shiny &amp; manageable. Leave it on as a quick conditioning treatment in the shower for 5 minutes &amp; rinse. If that doesn&#x27;t work, take it to the extreme &amp; submerge all 3 strands of what remains on your head before bedtime, cover w/ a shower cap &amp; let that s**** absorb overnight. Rinse out during your morning shower, style &amp; enjoy a day of Beyonce hair.</li>
    <li> I used this about a week ago after I got my hair dyed blonde at a salon, before I used it my ends were like cotton candy, but now they are silky smooth and healthy, I cannot wait to see what long usage of this will do to my hair.</li>
    <li> If you like your hair to be silky .. this is it! My hair stylist applied on my hair just for a &amp;#34;little lift up&amp;#34; after some color. She just put it on my hair and put a plastic cap.. no heat was necessary (but if you want, do it for about 15 minutes). Other then the smell, that is wonderful, the only other mask I would recommend would be the Macadamia Oil mask. Very happy!</li>
    <li> Great product ..will continue to buy it..Smells awesome, worth every penny</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that gets dry from blow drying and color. I use this conditioner with a heating cap weekly or 2X monthly and my hair looks great. Not greasy, just rinse well. Delivered quickly and the price is better than cost in salon.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I use it everyday to keep my hair from being too frizzy due to its curly thickness. I recently started using it on my daughter&#x27;s fine thin hair to help with knots in between shampooing days. It can be very costly but well worth its weight. I don&#x27;t use it the way they tell you to as into rinsing it out, I keep it in my hair after it has been washed.</li>
    <li> My hair had been quite damaged from lightening so I bought this product.  I&#x27;ve been using twice a week for about 3 weeks and have had excellent results!  At this point I&#x27;m going to start using just once a week. I don&#x27;t have any products I&#x27;ve used in the last to compare this to,  but I definitely have seen improvement.  My hair is fairy straight and fine,  so the product weighs it down the day I use it because of the moisture,  but doesn&#x27;t make it feel greasy.</li>
    <li> Actually made my hair drier amd very brittle and it started falling out</li>
    <li> I have intensely dry, damaged hair that is prone to frizz due to its natural waves, and I am on an eternal search for the products that will make my hair look its best.  It seems I have tried just about every product that&#x27;s ever been sold, and my bathroom cabinets often look like a salon&#x27;s shelves-- with dozens of brands of shampoos, conditioners, oils, masks, creams, and &amp;#34;treatments.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my stylist recommended this Moroccan Oil Mask, I was quite skeptical; she had recommended another treatment that I thought was garbage.  I bought this mask anyway, and gave it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask DOES soften my hair, and DOES enhance my hair&#x27;s waves for the day after the mask&#x27;s use, but that effect doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  If I get my hair wet at all, even if that moisture comes from rain, the &amp;#34;softness&amp;#34; of my hair is mostly gone, and it is back to its dry state.  That makes me believe that this mask is probably just coating my hair with something instead of actually moisturizing it.  The actual hair shaft doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb anything, but it instead just gets coated.</li>
    <li> This mask was great at hydrating my very dry colored hair</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews and carefully considering this product (loaded with silicons) I decided to cough up the 40 dollars and try it. My hair is thin and dry from dying it so I figured my hair needed a nice mask. This product failed in every category. It did not make my hair smooth, it smelt strange, and it actually feels more dry. I followed the directions and even tried leaving it on for more time than instructed. This product DID NOT WORK. I just finished returning it (thank you amazon)</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about a year and I can honestly say that my hair has become beyond healthy! Great product it is well worth the price. My hair was over processed and over dyed it was breaking off everywhere I was panicking because nothing was working. That is until I tried this product it was sort of like no other option because nothing else was working well the outcome was healthy silky shiny hair that is not breaking off anywhere. As with any new product be patient give it time to work I promise you will see a difference within a month. One last thing I use this product once a week every Sunday I put this conditioner in my hair and clean my house and cook dinner before I rinse it out and I have been doing this for a year and my hair is stronger than ever!</li>
    <li> I received it real quick, I tried it this weekend and my hair looks great! I hope with continued use it gets better, my hair is horrible from constant dying.</li>
    <li> product as described....took a little longer then i tugh to get the product...... was packed......will buy again but next time ill make sure to buy earlier then i need</li>
    <li> I bought this to deep condition my color treated hair. My hair is fine but I don&#x27;t feel like this weighs my hair down. Makes it really soft &amp; smells great!</li>
    <li> I love how my hair feels after using it and it makes it very easy to untangle</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Makes your hair feel thick and shiny. Gives it lots of volume. Will purchase again</li>
    <li> This will last you so long! And it&#x27;s really great for brining unhealthy hair back to life.</li>
    <li> Good for once a week treatments. But no more as it made my hair oily if it exceeded that.</li>
    <li> This is a must have for a dry environment or damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product is perfect for my curly hair</li>
    <li> Used this product on my over stressed and chemically treated hair and I liked it better than my more $$ hair masques. It definitely made a difference.</li>
    <li> Wow!!! When I first ordered this I was a little skeptical because I know some places that don&#x27;t have the real Moroccan oil products but this is definitely real. I used it this morning and my hair looks brand new and silky. If you purchase this item you will not be disappointed. I recommend this for everybody.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this same  product 6 months ago at a local hair salon and loved the product and the wonderful smell.&lt;br /&gt;The same product I bought from amazon has a nasty smell and is not the same quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My guess is that it is old and has fermented. I wanted to mail it back for a return however have not taken the time to do so. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  It really helps repair your hair.  The smell is fabulous!  I recommend using the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> What I love about this is that it doesn&#x27;t make the hair sticky or oily. My hair feels bouncy and beautiful when i use it :) Highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;So here is how I use it: I wash my hair with shampoo very well so it is not oily and clean.  I then put the mask on it by dividing it into strands. By the end of this process, all my hair is covered with the mask.  Just under my house there is a beautiful hair saloon which has a steamer. So I go use it for 20-30 minutes and wash it afterwards.  It feels awesome!</li>
    <li> This Moroccan Oil is a must for dry ,Frizzy Hair.I have to say i do use other Hair Mask also but i find from time to time i have to switch to another product because i have either used them to long or because i am not getting the same results, than when i go back to the other products they work great again.This is a 5 star product very simple to use after i wash my Hair i add a generous amount to towel dried Hair,than comb through from Roots to Ends the bottle says leave on for 5-7 minutes but if my Hair is really dry i leave on up to 20 minutes,i also use a shower cap and just read a Book or catch up on House work than just rinse out simple.The results are awesome leaves Hair with a nice shine ,great Texture,Good Bye Frizz and Dry unruly Hair.The scent is so good also.I use this twice a week  easy to maintain my Hair.I also have the MoroccanOil Weightless Mask too that works great too and recommended for fine,Dry Hair the one i just wrote about is for Medium to thick dry Hair i use them both and they both leave me with great results.</li>
    <li> Hair feels like silk after using this. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff worked wonders on my bleached blonde hair! Would definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> nice smell great buy will rebuy for seller</li>
    <li> I like the product but the one I received is not the real one. Does not have the big M. They are sending you the cheaper version I believe.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves the hair silky and shiny. What I don&#x27;t like is the smell. Smells like honey I think.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I would buy it again</li>
    <li> Kinda of dissapointed... Wasnt as good as the moroccan oil.  Also it was packaged like it could have been any creme in the jar. Nothing that could really tell it was original.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product for dry or over processed hair. I use it once a week and leave it on for the length of my shower and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great scent&lt;br /&gt;Good daily conditioner&lt;br /&gt;Not too heavy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Price&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t notice any real improvement in my hair. I&#x27;ve been using for over a month, and my hair feels conditioned but not really repaired.</li>
    <li> good care for my hair</li>
    <li> Foi um pedido. Quem usa afirma que funciona bem. Excelente para dar de presente. É da linha MoroccanOil, já bem conhecida e de qualidade.</li>
    <li> This product has a lot of hype behind it because of the brand. I have thick, curly hair and it softens my hair a bit, but it doesn&#x27;t provide a whole lot of moisturize for the price. I expected more. It&#x27;s ok, but for the price I expected a lot more. Not worth the money!</li>
    <li> I left this mask on for 30min with a shower covering my head. I almost couldn&#x27;t believe the results! My hair looked perfect... no joke. It was better even then a deep conditioning treatment I once got from a salon.</li>
    <li> At a good hair salon I spent double the amount of money priced here! But it works! My hair was drying out for whatever reason. So my hair stylist recommended this product. After i dry my hair there is still some dryness left but not like I had it before. And it seems that the more i use it (after shampooing) leaving it for 5 minutes or more, my hair gets better. Worth the money and it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair mask I have ever used.  I am an African American woman with natural hair and it just does wonders to the texture of my hair!!! And the smell is so great that my husband even commented on it :) This is a must have your hair will be bouncy, shiny and just really silky feeling no matter the texture :)</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical to purchase on line..... Which now I know I had every reason.&lt;br /&gt;Product I received was Not what I purchased, it was a knock off brand!</li>
    <li> I wrote a previous review on the Moroccan Oil Shampoo and Conditioner, and this is the other product from this line that I purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With sun and chemical damage done, along with using tons of heat styling tools, I was left with some damaged and brittle places. With the additives of Argon Oil and Keratin, these essential ingredients to shiny healthy hair are now available in this hair mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try and use this mask once/twice per week.  Shampoo and Condition like normal, then towel dry hair and smooth and comb through the Hydrating Mask.  Leave on for 5-7 minutes and then rinse.  After, I always put in a little of the Moroccan leave in oil.  I have to tell you, all of these products get 5 stars in my book! My hair has never been shinier, softer, or easily managed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never tried Moroccan Oil, don&#x27;t walk, but run to your stylist or salon and try it.  You will be amazed at the difference you see and feel in your hair.  It is essential for damaged/dry hair to be conditioned, and Moroccan Oil has it down to an art.</li>
    <li> I love this product as well as shampoo and conditioner.  If you&#x27;re hair us fine or thinning then it&#x27;s not for you. Works wonders to keep hsir hydrated and frizz free in high humidity.</li>
    <li> Works OK for me.  I have curly, dry hair and this product works as any other conditioner I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> great product, excellent. I have bought this before and love it, had to have it again. totally recommend it. excellent service too.</li>
    <li> No longer relaxed.. may try again.  This product did not work well on my hair at all.  I am African American, relaxed hair.  This product did not give my hair very much &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; and it did not detangle well after use.</li>
    <li> I have used Moroccan Oil products many times.  When I received the mask (which I have purchased before from a salon), there wasn&#x27;t a logo anywhere on the container and the consistency was totally different.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> MY GOSH!..THIS IS A WONDERFUL PRODUCT! MY HAIR IS SO SOFT AND LOVELY, I CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE IN MY HAIR FROM ALL THE OTHER PRODUCTS I&#x27;VE USED. THIS PRODUCT STANDS BY WHAT IS SAYS.  I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE.</li>
    <li> Expensive but made an immediate difference</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase.  My hairdresser suggested I try it so I went to Amazon &amp; found it for $20.00 less than she wanted to charge me.  My hair is so soft to the touch and still has plenty of body.  I recommend it to anyone who has thick hair that tends to dry out!</li>
    <li> Product is great so far.</li>
    <li> I do like this mask for putting in my hair at the beginning of the day (like up in a ponytail) (I don&#x27;t really use it as suggested---I just leave it in for the day without rinsing it out).  It helps calm the frizziness in my thin, frizzy hair.  I haven&#x27;t noticed that much long-term difference in my hair (and remember that I don&#x27;t use as suggested).  I do love the scent...it&#x27;s not too strong, but leaves my hair smelling very nice.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!!! I use it after the shower and drench and comb it through my hair, put a cap on and sit under a hair dryer for 10 minutes then either leave it on the rest of  the day or rinse it off with warm water and go about my day. Makes my hair feel fabulous and it really helps my color stay longer. I recommend doing this treatment 3-4 times a week.</li>
    <li> I applied the Moroccan oil hydrating mask after shampooing my hair and then sat under the dryer for 20 minutes then I washed my hair and results were superb!  My hair felt soft and easy to run the comb through, and it was still soft and shiny after one week after using the mask.  I have not had such nice and shiny hair even though I spent money on other products such as Aveda  and Kera care deep conditioning treatments.</li>
    <li> Love it. Leave it on longer to really condition. I use it every two weeks to keep up moisture in the ends of my hair.</li>
    <li> Really works! After shampooing, this product really moisturizes my hair and detangles making it more manageable!</li>
    <li> i use this this deep conditioner once a week, and it seems to be really working at keeping my hair nice and shiny!</li>
    <li> i thought this was gonna be bigger for the price, but i honesty dnt mind buying this product again &amp; again because it keeps my hair soft during the week!! love love it!!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase and cam very quickly.</li>
    <li> good product for the hair, my wife like it.</li>
    <li> It is fair enough. Good product, good price.</li>
    <li> this was for my wife. she loves this products.</li>
    <li> Gross product for my very thick and dry hair!  Has really improved my hair in a short time!</li>
    <li> My hair was destroyed due to the abuse of dyes and hair dryer, after i used this product the change was incredible my hair looks so healthy and shiny. I</li>
    <li> I have dry, thin, chemically treated hair and needed a product to help with breakage and for smoothing the flyaways. This Moroccan Oil has immediately helped with dryness and does what it claims to do. Excellent product I will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> Like all moroccan oil products it smells wonderful. It works well, but no better than similar products at much lower price points in my experience.</li>
    <li> I bought the shampoo and also the mask, they go great together and you should buy the oil as well.</li>
    <li> Wow I have only used this once and I could feel the difference right away. It is winter in Wisconsin and my curly/wavy/combination hair is dry anyway, but this stuff really made a difference. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I am not sure that this is great for all hair types, but it works really well for my hair. I have been using it for more than 3 years now. It makes my hair feel great and I like the scent. I only use it once every 6 weeks or so because when I used it more frequently, the benefits were not great. Again, the useful of hair products will vary from person to person, but I think this just might be worth a try.</li>
    <li> My hair was dried and damaged from years of coloring and heat, and I&#x27;ve been trying to get it healthy again. This worked the first time I used it, I noticed my hair was significantly more manageable and soft, so I use it twice a week. I love it!</li>
    <li> This mask transforms my hair.  I&#x27;m a 42 year old with processed, find and thinning hair.  This mask gives me &amp;#34;youthful&amp;#34; looking hair.. silky soft, shiny and full.  I don&#x27;t usually spend a lot of money on products, sort of a drugstore purchaser but I will buy this faithfully.. LOVE it!</li>
    <li> A big disappointment.  I expected more from MorroncanOil.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent.  It is a lot cheaper to buy on Amazon.com then it is to purchase it in the salons!</li>
    <li> I love moroccan oil and use their hair serum all the time. I was disappointed with the hair mask. Each time I used it, it seemed to make my hair frizzy and stringy. Not the results I was hoping for. I will look for something else for future hair conditioning.</li>
    <li> It did not arrive sealed. Also I have sensitive nose, so its smell is too strong for me.</li>
    <li> Works just as described, highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Product as described. Thanks</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  Delivers fantastic results in the first appication.  Was recomended by my hair dresser, and she was absoulutely right on with her choice for fast awesome results.  I have shared this amazing product recommendation to all my friends!!!  This is a must have item for hair products.</li>
    <li> This hair mask by Moroccan Oil is fantastic. It took a few months, but my hair is now gorgeous, shiny and full. Before I started using this product my hair was dry, coarse, and frizzy from over processing. Not anymore-definitely a big and very noticeable improvement. I highly recommend this hair mask and find it more effective than the much higher priced Keratase hair restoration products. Very glad I used it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting to try this product for a long time because I heard so many wonderful things about it.  I was concerned however, if my product would be the real thing.  I am happy to say it is and I am very happy with my experience.  My hair felt very hydrated, moisturized and soft when I applied it.  No tangles.  The same when I rinsed it out.  The product is creamy, yet not heavy on the hair.  I could feel a difference when I applied it opposed to other masks I have used in the past.  I am quite happy and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, just using once or twice a week for a month or so now I can see and feel a difference. I was a bit hesitant because I have fine hair, but I don&#x27;t get to the roots and don&#x27;t do it too heavily and focus on my ends. It&#x27;s what my hair desperately needed.  Will repurchase again and again!</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft and shiny without excessive fragrance. Very pleasant product for deep conditioning. I also like the Moroccan Oil shampoo.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be very good due to the great number of good comments. I was surprised to find out that it is not as effective. I do not know why it does not make my hair as soft and smooth as normal conditioner would do. I was disappointed indeed. I use Wella hydrate intensive hair mask and this is by far the best product for me. I do not know why there is so little comment on that product. Perhaps it is not so famous in the US market.</li>
    <li> When I put it in my hair then rinse it ,my hair feels so soft , and then after my hair is dry my hair feels dry and normal, means it goes back to its normal state ugh I hate this</li>
    <li> Very good for dry hair! I would highly recommend it. Use it twice a week and leave it in for 15 minutes then wash it</li>
    <li> LOVED IT! I&#x27;m glad I went for this instead of the Maccadamia brand. This mask  left my hair shiny and soft. You could see the difference inmediately. I reccomend this for people with very damaged and thirsty hair. The smell was ok, (not a fan of it)</li>
    <li> I love this product, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to keep your hair from drying out after a few days!</li>
    <li> This is a great hydration mask, with a good smell. I would recommend it for those who want to take care of the hair at home!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not 100% sure but when I opened this container, it looked to me to have been opened previously and tampered with.  The product was watery and not a full container either.  I think I&#x27;ve learned a big lesson here, only purchase Moroccan Oil products from their website.  I mean really when you think about it, how are these individuals selling this kind of product and making a profit.  I smell a rat.</li>
    <li> This is the best mask I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair.  My hair loves it.  I use once a week and I&#x27;m very happy with this so it&#x27;s a safe bet that I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
    <li> This was not the Moroccan Oil I wanted.  The package arrived opened, with am unusual smell.  It seemed to be mixed at home and packaged in a conferfeit bottle.  Not only did it not moisturize like an authentic Moroccan Oil product, it also made my scalp itch.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> I love this product it works great you can not go wrong with Moroccan  oil  it does not leave your hair oily</li>
    <li> This product is so toxic that it can cause excessive skin dryness, hives, irritate and inflame eczema on contact with your hands. The product contains less than 5-10% of the original oil in the formula. The formula consists of numerous toxic ingredients that are formulated to provide a smell and a feel of some type of oil. The Ingredients are on the box and not the container because they do not want the consumer to become aware the high level of toxins in the product. This products was placed and the hands of celebrities and the rest is history.&lt;br /&gt;Please do not buy it and do not waste your money on something what is bad for our body</li>
    <li> My at home masks are better than this one. Smells great though.</li>
    <li> I chose to purchase this hydrating mask because I have very dry hair due to coloring. In the past have used moroccan oil products that I absolutely LOVED. They made my hair feel amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to give this product a shot thinking it would work even better because it is a &amp;#34;intense hydrating mask&amp;#34;. After purchasing and using this product, the next day my hair was very oily and felt extremely heavy. It made my hair feel disgusting and I had to wash it two more times to completely remove it&#x27;s weight from my hair. I will NEVER purchase this specific mask again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love moroccan oil products!! However, if you have naturally straight hair that has a tendency to become slightly oily between washes, the &amp;#34;weightless hydrating mask&amp;#34; would probably work much better for you! The packaging is the same as this product except it has a white lid and is labeled &amp;#34;weightless hydrating mask&amp;#34;. Hope you found this helpful!</li>
    <li> i love the smell, love how it makes my hair feel.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use another product again ... I wish they had more in their product line.</li>
    <li> Love this leaves my hair so soft.</li>
    <li> i bought this from a salon. its ok, smells great as expected, but i didnt c any improvement post shower. im use to aveda moisture masque and coconut oil.</li>
    <li> Excellent lovee amazing thabku</li>
    <li> 유효기간이 없고 상단 뚜껑 종이 중 일부가 정사각형으로 잘려 나갔네요&lt;br /&gt;아마 QR 코드 부분으로 추측 됩니다&lt;br /&gt;이유는 문의를 해볼 예정 입니다&lt;br /&gt;하지만 제품 자체는 와이프가 좋다고 하네요&lt;br /&gt;국내에도 기본 케이스와 이름은 같은데 디자인이 다른 상품이 저렴하게 많이 파네요&lt;br /&gt;알아보고 구매 하세요</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something to truly moisturize your hair, then look no further!  This worked on my extremely dry (african american) natural hair!  Takes hardly any time to do so too!  Just a few minutes with a conditioning cap while you do something else and you&#x27;re done!  Great product!</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t used this, but my mother did. She says that it&#x27;s excelent for hair repair... so if you want to try it, go on.</li>
    <li> After my mid-40s my hair became extremely dry to the point I couldn&#x27;t pull a comb through it despite using a panorama of rich shampoos &amp; conditioners (both drugstore &amp; luxury brands) as well as styling oils and other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, you know how dry hair can really age you: mine had no luster, no softness or movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So hearing the hype about Moroccan Oil products, I overlooked its steep price and bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And - wow, what a **monumental** difference it&#x27;s made in my hair! Three days after I worked a large dollop into my rat&#x27;s nest hair, it&#x27;s now silky, glossy, the color rich and gorgeous. While my hair is silky-fine, this product doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. To the contrary, my hair has body, volume &amp; shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently you use it twice a week until the condition of your hair improves (and then weekly). Just work it through your hair and let it sit for 5-7 minutes and rinse out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth every single penny!</li>
    <li> Love the product,recommend the seller</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product. I only use this product once &amp; so far so good.</li>
    <li> I received a moroccanoil product different than the one that I requested. I didn&#x27;t received the product on the fotograph.</li>
    <li> I have dry, curly hair that is prone to frizz.  Since using this, my curls are bouncy and soft.  I love the smell as well.  Definitely see a difference in my hair after just one week of use.  Much better than the TIGI S Factor Serious Conditioner I used previously and I liked that stuff too.  Pricey but you don&#x27;t use much (a tablespoon *ish amount)  so it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> This product really does the job. My dry and color treated hair became softer and moisturized. I use it twice a week.</li>
    <li> great for thick hair as well. it works best when you really comb in thru the hair and let it sit with heat for 30 minutes. ive been using deep conditioners with out heat lately and i promise heat makes a difference not matter what deep conditioner you decide to you.</li>
    <li> love this makes your hair feel so soft!</li>
    <li> My hair is extremely hard to moisturize. Coarse plus sun and color-damage. This hydrating mask works. However I have YET to find a Moroccanoil SHAMPOO that is also hydrating.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent! This is the second time I buy it, and I love it. Good choice for my hair.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. my hair was damaged because of all the straightening and dyeing in the past. Nothing seemed to work for me except Moroccan Oil and the vitamin Biotin(can get at the drug store or on here). My hair is finally healthy. I&#x27;m not too crazy about the smell, but others seem to like it.</li>
    <li> Best treatment out there for your hair!!!!  It is great to put on befire bed and sleep in....your hair will feel like silk.</li>
    <li> it is not hydrating but rather oily.&lt;br /&gt;this is too pricey and it is like expensive wax. doesn&#x27;t do the job</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t as soft as my previous purchase from a different seller.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it once a week and it makes my hair so shiny and soft. I recommend it for people with dry hair; however, I have oily hair and this stuff works wonders.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and this one was fine, but not as good as the past few time.  I think this might be a knock off version I got.</li>
    <li> I have curly frizzy hair and only use heavy conditioners.  They hydrate a lot better.  This product is one of my favorites</li>
    <li> Great hair mask for dry hair! I loved it, smells nice too! If your hair is fine or oily use with great care. Dry hair, this is between salon visits cure!!!!</li>
    <li> I use it every time il wash my hair. It does miracles to my hair. Really great mask!!!! And my hair has been through A LOT!!</li>
    <li> I have tired, gray covered up, dry hair. After using this my hairdresser said he couldn&#x27;t believe the difference and asked what I had been using.</li>
    <li> I love this mask but be aware of the seller Mikeluge. I was just about to apply the mask on my hair when I smelled that unmistakable odor of old oil. When I checked the bottom of the jar, it expired on August 2013. Then, looking closely, the item is not even original Moroccanoil. Be aware of the seller! I can&#x27;t believe they do that to people.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I have curly hair after I  blow dry straight (2-3 days unwashed) I leave this product over night, wash and style curly the next day, my curls are back to normal. Beautiful and non frizzy.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! It really conditions my hair. I blow out my hair (straighten it) once a week. This is an awesome conditioner for someone who constantly uses heat on their hair. I don&#x27;t wash my hair very often because its not good for your hair. So I wash it once a week and I always use this conditioner. Its great! Nothing wrong with it. :D</li>
    <li> Love it!  The best deep conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. Made my hair feel stronger and softer. I&#x27;ll be recommending it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Excellent product  , fast shipping and love it</li>
    <li> The one that my wife was looking for. I have rcomended for lots of freineds and the loved it quite bit.</li>
    <li> I like this it is not something I would buy all the time but it is great for summer after sitting in the sun or swimming. I have other products that do the same and are not that much money and still name and salon brand.</li>
    <li> It leaves my hair soft and more manageable as I&#x27;ve chemically damaged hair. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s any better than the kiehls olive hair mask which I find the best in market and cost less.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING! I have been using this for 2 weeks now and my hair is so shiny and smooth. One of my favorite hair products by far!</li>
    <li> I have bleach highlights and my hair gets dried out easily.  Use this stuff once a week and your hair will feel like silk!</li>
    <li> Hmmm what can i say... if you leave it in your hair long enough it works. I&#x27;ve used it about 5 times and the morrocanoil smell has already left the product just smells like vasiline. if your in the shower to long after using the product the moisture decreases.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product that I use on my hair to help with softness, and conditioning. I use it every time I wash my haIr!</li>
    <li> BEST HYDRATING TREATMENT...and smells amazing!!</li>
    <li> My deep fat-fried blonde hair couldnt take much more. This mask is a lifesaver! My hair finally has some body back without heavy oil.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  Smells wonderful too, my hair is  so soft and shiny.  I use it a couple times a week my hair is past my waist so it needs a good conditioner.  This is it.....</li>
    <li> This is a great product for my extremely dry hair. It makes my hair silky and soft. Some products make my hair TOO soft and lifeless BUT this product is very balanced.</li>
    <li> Mi  wife loves this product.</li>
    <li> Moroccan Oil has many product and I have being using many of them and this product is nice. give it a try</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.  It smells so amazing and makes my hair smell fabulous!  I will never be without this product.  As long as they make it, I will buy it!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Let the soft, light hair with a nice smell. Improved the dry aspect of my hair. I use once a week. Super recommended product.</li>
    <li> I have coarse, color-treated hair and this product saves the day! I usually use it 2 times a week and use the Moroccan Oil every day after the shower.  This also smells PHENOMENAL!!!!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product that brings your hair back to life and makes it feel silky &amp; healthy again. Everyone MUST own</li>
    <li> good product, but I think is a bit expensive for what it does</li>
    <li> Good Product as everything on this line.</li>
    <li> Amazing hair product! Buy the oils as well, keeps hair healthy and not greasy at all!</li>
    <li> haircial for you hair!  smells divine! stays in your hair up to 3 days</li>
    <li> its smelly, and continuos smelly for days. and not soften my hair</li>
    <li> I have thick, frizzy hair, and upon reading all of the recommendations, I decided to give this product a try.  I immediately noticed a difference in the softness and managability of my hair.  I highly recommend Moroccan Oil Mask!</li>
    <li> I love this mask.&lt;br /&gt;I live in the desert and I use flat iron daily.&lt;br /&gt;So my hair is always super dry.&lt;br /&gt;This product saved my dry dull hair and now I have hair that actually glows!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I just use Shampoo daily and use this product a couple times a week.</li>

    <li> I have tried the product and love it. I don&#x27;t use it when blowing drying my hair but its AWESOME when doing my wet look. does not look dry or frizzie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my type of hair -- curly, frizzy, very dry and brittle. It&#x27;s so easy to use. I just shampoo, rinse, put a &amp;#34;slab&amp;#34; on my hair, work through with my fingers, rinse and done! I can actually comb out (with a wide tooth comb) and makes my hair so much softer. Really love it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT! MY HAIR NOW IS PERFECT! QUALITY MATERIAL! MY FRIENDS WANT THIS ONE TOO! I GREAT PRODUCT! GREAT PRICE TOO! I&#x27;M IN LOVE WITH...</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this given the average rating and reviews, but for me this did absolutely nothing. My mother bought it and neither of us had any results. Definitely not worth the money. Would not use even for free.</li>
    <li> very nice. not too heavy. I use it every time i shampoo.  wonderful product.  i need six more words so here there are.</li>
    <li> This mask is the best conditioner ever.  I work out and my hair often dried out but this conditioner puts the moisture back in my hair.  Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> I have A LOT of hair. I struggle finding a good hydrating mask bc most of them make my hair oily either immediately after or the next day.&lt;br /&gt;This one hydrates my hair but does not make it so oily. It brings out the shine and reduces the volume just enough. It calms my hair down perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes just use it as conditioner and when I have time I do what I&#x27;m supposed to: leave in for 20-30 minutes. Of course, the latter works best, but I don&#x27;t always have the time.&lt;br /&gt;This already is my 3rd pot and I plan on continuing to buy them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it almost 2 month at lease 2 times a week, but honestly havent really see any change on my partially damage hair (I had color and perm done before). I am not sure I wil keep purchasing it or no, but for sure will wait after I finish the Whole bottle to decide.</li>
    <li> Great product . My hair is extremely dry from daily wash and coloring but this product makes my curls soft and I people love my curls when I use this. If you have curly hair you really should get this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product out there! It provides shine and the mask in tandem gives the hair a soft healthy feel. Best mask product that I know! I&#x27;ve tried a good number of hair products.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a total bomb because it does condition somewhat and smell nice, but for the price point simply not worth it. Any other deep conditioner could do the job for a lot less.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, damaged hair and this product made my hair so unbelievably soft. It also smells great, like their other products.</li>
    <li> I have relaxed African American hair. My hair is dry and I have a lot of breakage and this literally made my hair softer smoother, less tangled and frizzy after one use. I washed my hair then towel dried my hair then put this product on really focusing on my ends. then wrapped it in a plastic cap and chilled with it for an hour or so (lol got caught up watching a movie) after I washed my hair I sprayed Its a 10 (another amazing product) and let my hair air dry. My hair feels and looks great. SO WORTH THE MONEY!! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for oily prone hair though its pretty heavy. But if you have chemically treated hair use this no more then twice a week, you will definitely notice the difference!!</li>
    <li> Morocanoil products are great and I´d highly recommend it to everyone looking for the perfect purchase, works like a charm</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the reviews.  I have fine, dry hair and for me, I didn&#x27;t see or feel a difference.</li>
    <li> I know this is supposed to be for heavy conditioning but it works great for every day use for me. I have normal hair. My hair is not thick or thin or wavy. It is just normal straight hair. This is a great product!</li>
    <li> Works great for my coarse hair. I&#x27;ve had frizz problems for years and this product has definitely helped me manage it better. Only problem is the high price. Use sparingly!</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair super soft and manageable. Morrocan oil is a very good brand and their products are phenomenal. love it</li>
    <li> I recommend this product. A little pricey but I think it is worth it because it will last a long time</li>
    <li> Wife was getting treatments done for her thick/wavy/curly hair at the salon for $100 a pop. Bought this to save money, she says it&#x27;s about the same result as the salon treatment. A lot cheaper. Helps keep her hair more manageable in the humid southern U.S. summer weather.</li>
    <li> happy with purchase, fast delivery</li>
    <li> This product works great! My hair feels soft afterwards and helps with stressed, dry hair. It&#x27;s a little pricy but worth every penny</li>
    <li> Cant imagine my life without Morrocan Oil. Hope it never gets discontinued. Hair is so so so soft after using it that nothing else in lige is necessary.</li>
    <li> I use this twice a week and it really helped my dead hair and the split ends too but you have to keep all the hair styling away to see this major difference on your hair</li>
    <li> If you want soft, lustrous hair, but what you&#x27;ve got is dry, dull, and lifeless, this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the high price.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!...one of the best products...I always buy it...recommended 100%.</li>
    <li> It works so well to condition my hair and make it stronger. My hair used to break in the winter due to dryness. Now it is stronger and beautiful.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  It&#x27;s super hydrating. Makes hair feel like silk.  It does weigh it down, so not for use when you really need to style it.  Great for blondes!  I&#x27;ve bought some for my friends too.  give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;Also, my husband loves the smell</li>
    <li> Just as background - I&#x27;m Puerto Rican with really curly hair.  It tends to dry out really quickly.  I have been using the Moroccan Oil shampoo and conditioner and really like it but needed some extra hydrating.  I towel dried my hair and applied the product and brushed it into my hair and clipped it up for about an hour before I rinsed it out.  After I rinsed it I used a little Moroccan Oil leave in conditioner for curly hair and then defused it.  My hair felt and looked really healthy - nice spiral curls and not a lot of friz.  I would recomment this product for people with course,curly hair that dries out and gets frizzy.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff..... Fast shipping</li>
    <li> I typically have very dry hair and this product works amazingly. It has lasted me a long time. This is the best brand, better than the knock-offs you see in the store these days that list their product as having argon oil in the product. This was the original before the argon oil trend. I notice it works best after I shampoo. Then I put in conditioner and apply to the tips and let sit for 5-10 minutes. I highly recommend and you should see instant results.</li>
    <li> I dye my hair so it tends to be dry. After using this mask along with conditioner my hair is healthy and silky smooth. It&#x27;s a little pricey but SO worth the money plus you only need to use a small amount each time. It actually lasts longer than you would think. Just make sure you comb it through your hair after application.</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair soft very nice product</li>
    <li> love this product. it works wonders on my hair. lasts a long time and makes hair soft, shiny and manageable.</li>
    <li> Perfect treat for dry  or colored hair.</li>
    <li> I am a 51 female who after years of processing her hair basically destroyed it all.  My new hairdresser, who is my age recommended the morccanoil products along with a SHORT hair cut in order to repair the damage, with cuts every 5-6 weeks. Also, needed to toss out the curling iron.  Wasn&#x27;t to thrilled with the idea of short hair but she convinced me I needed short hair, I must admit the cut was incredible.  She also spent two hours educating me on the care of my hair, how to use the products and how to style this new hair cut.  Have been Using the following Moroccanoil products for about 18 weeks: Moisture Repair Shampoo, Moisture Repair conditioner, Intense Hydrating Mask (twice a week), Hairspray - medium finish, treatment oil light and frizz control.  Just starting to have to replace the products after the initial purchase, still have half a bottle of conditioner, 1/3 jar of mask, half bottle of oil, 3/4 bottle of frizz control. The products are pricey however, the results are well worth every dime.  The condition of my hair now is that of a 20 year old.  All of the products leave your hair soft, shiney and of course the smell is awesome. Highly recommend all of these products.</li>
    <li> My hair loves this mask! It makes a huge difference in the winter, helping calm down those dry frizzy hairs. The  visible effects last for two or three days, and are particularly noticeable the first day. Also, I could really tell the difference when I skipped using the product for two weeks while I had the flu ... my poor hair once again began to feel like straw, and stuck out all over. As per the directions on the container, I  use quite a bit at once, and leave it in for a full five minutes before rinsing. Afterwards,  I massage a small amount two of pure Argan oil  or a Moroccan oil leave-in  mixed with an anti-frizz product like John Frieda as  (I do that daily, using ).  I&#x27;ve tried just massaging in the argan oil/anti frizz combo without the mask, but that doesn&#x27;t work as well on roots and shorter broken hairs (they either don&#x27;t get enough oil or they get too much). And, the mask alone doesn&#x27;t last long enough by itself, hence the combo. As a side note, the above has been my hair care regime since November; it may require less effort to maintain the good effects of the oil when spring comes. While it&#x27;s expensive, the bottom line is that I get compliments from my stylist on the great condition my hair is in when I use this ... and suggestions about products to buy that will fix the frizz when I don&#x27;t :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/21/2013  Still loving this mask. As I thought, I needed it less during the spring, and began using it frequently again during the winter. A tiny bit of the mask does wonders when applied to the driest parts of my hair once or twice during a regular shampoo. When used this way, the product lasts a very long time! It&#x27;s actually cheaper for me to use this way than most conditioners. I like it in combination with using Wen and/or a sulfide-free conditioning shampoo during the week; drops of Argan oil in both remain part of my hair care regime.</li>
    <li> I love this mask, its perfect for damaged hair. It also has a great smell! I would highly recommend this mask.</li>
    <li> I just love this stuff - great for my hair!!!</li>
    <li> Really gives your hair a softness that other products cannot. Works wonderfully when used with other Moroccanoil products. I have color-treated, natural, curly hair and it makes my hair feel healthy and hydrated. I don&#x27;t even need to apply it everyday. That&#x27;s what I love most about their products. Highly, highly recommend using this product along with others that they offer. They are a bit pricy, but your hair will thank you. I apply a generous amount to my hair and comb it through, and let it sit on my hair (with a shower cap) for about an hour. Then I rinse. DO not wash it out of your hair, rinse it out...very important distinction. Then style regularly. Excellent for blow dried styles!! And my favorite thing about Moroccanoil products is that they work on ALL HAIR TYPES. Thin/fine, straight, curly, coarse, etc. If you don&#x27;t believe me, ask a stylist about Moroccanoil to see what they say! If you are doubtful it will work on your hair, just try a sample! You can even buy a smaller size for about $10-$15 (sold by Moroccanoil, not sure about Amazon) if you want to test out the product. Please, please, please, if you are unsure or hesitant in any way, do yourself a favor, and at least spend the $10-$15 to test it out rather than going for broke buying the full size! You owe it to yourself to have beautiful, healthy hair. Whatever your hair goals may be, give Moroccanoil a try if nothing else has worked for you. Good luck on your future hair endeavors!</li>
    <li> I use this every shampoo.  Leave it on while finishing your shower and then rinse!  What a difference it makes!</li>
    <li> Great hair product. It helps to have a healthy hair. I love it. It  does magic</li>
    <li> Love this product, but the seller ripped me off!!! Product is the BEST for deep conditioning, but I had a bad experience with the seller!!!!</li>
