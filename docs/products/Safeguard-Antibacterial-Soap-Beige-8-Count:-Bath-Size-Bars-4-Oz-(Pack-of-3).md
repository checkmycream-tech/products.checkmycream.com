      <li>The scent is not as strong as some antibacterial soap bars.  </li>
      <li>The box arrived a bit smashed, but the product was fine.</li>
      <li>but fortunately it&#x27;s available in Amazon.</li>
      <li>and they had it available.</li>

      <li>Just a great product...smells nice, not too harsh, keeps me feeling clean all day.</li>
      <li>I liked it because it smelled nice and left my skin a perfect balance not dry and not creamy soft (like some Dove products</li>
      <li>My new favorite!</li>

      <li>My mother was very pleased and surprised when she saw the price on these bars of soap.</li>
      <li>It keeps me squeaky clean, yet doesn&#x27;t kill my skin.</li>
      <li>It gets you clean.</li>
      <li>I feel clean and I smell clean.  </li>
      <li>I used Lever 2000 soap, but just never felt clean or smelled clean enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It reminds me of the smell one may find in a semi-fancy therapists office, a scent that is clean and calming.</li>
      <li>Safeguard lathers well, rinses well and leaves you smelling clean, not perfumed.  </li>
      <li>Delivery was quick &amp; free as well.  </li>
      <li>This soap leave my skin feeling clean and I no longer experience after shower itchiness.</li>
      <li>This soap makes me sqeeky clean and smell that way all day.</li>
      <li>It left us feeling clean, it smelled good, and it was cheaper than Dial.  </li>
      <li>I can appreciate that, but for me, really, what is safe or not?</li>
      <li>it really feels like it&#x27;s better than all the rest.</li>
      <li>so I stocked up at a reasonable price and am still satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>I love this soap so much I have it on auto order.</li>
      <li>Makes the skin feel really fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>it gets you clean and leaves you smelling freshly washed.  </li>
      <li>I guess it is a mild bactericide.</li>
      <li>If you are the same type of guy like me who cannot stand the dove and other &amp;#34;fashion&amp;#34; &amp;#34;skin protection&amp;#34; and self advertised &amp;#34;nutritious &amp;#34; type soap that will leave sitcky or silky additives on your skin, then you&#x27;d better hurry in and get these packs, they are cheap and good and does what a soap supposed to be doing and some more: to protect you from bacterials.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
      <li>When I found that Amazon was selling bulk packages of classic Safeguard Antibacterial Bar Soap, I was very excited and immediately purchased some for my household.  </li>
      <li>Just a mild fresh scent, nothing fancy.</li>
      <li>It is available at Walmart for a much lower price.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money too..</li>
      <li>I have tried several different types of deoderant soap and Safeguard is by far the best available.</li>
      <li>I like the fresh scent without perfume smell or oily feel.</li>
      <li>For the price, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>I also like the way it does NOT leave a colorful residue on the surface on which it rests.  </li>
      <li>This shipment consisted of wonderfully fresh soap...</li>
      <li>I have used many other brands of antibacterial bar soap in the meantime, mostly Dial, and have not found another that I like as well as this old favorite.  </li>
      <li>Good for your skin and protects from body odor longer than any other soap...</li>
      <li>I think all adults will love the fresh feel left with them after using this soap.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad to see that others love this product! I thought I was buying and enjoying some small unknown brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I forgot how I first discovered this product - I know it was in a Rite Aid and I was just browsing - I think I was looking specifically at price and this was cheaper than most (ironically, years later in another part of town at a Pathmark this soap is not the cheapest, albeit not the most expensive either).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend at the time liked it because it lacked an ingredient she said was bad that was found in most other soaps. I liked it because it smelled nice and left my skin a perfect balance not dry and not creamy soft (like some Dove products do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell - The first word that comes to mind is &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34;. There is a natural scent to it that conjures in my mind a clean meadow with many small plants - no other people, no animals, no cars. Just you in a wide open field surrounded by many small plants on fresh soil, perhaps still damp from a rain storm several days ago. It reminds me of the smell one may find in a semi-fancy therapists office, a scent that is clean and calming. And the smell isn&#x27;t over powering. Touch your nose to your skin after you&#x27;ve toweled off and you&#x27;ll smell it, you won&#x27;t walk by leaving a trail of a soapy scent. Other soaps claim to have this fresh natural scent, take Irish Spring for example. I tried them but all I found was a very chemically induced scent that badly faked some natural smells. And worse it was too strong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The balance - Obviously I don&#x27;t want my skin dried out, but some are surprised I don&#x27;t want it &amp;#34;creamy soft&amp;#34; either and that&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve felt after those other products like my skin still had the stuff on it to make it feel that &amp;#34;creamy soft&amp;#34;. I didn&#x27;t like the sensation of a soap leaving something on me, soft or not! When I dry off, my skin feels natural, it&#x27;s the only way I can describe it. It feels like my skin is how it should be, with no film over it, no coating, nor does it feel dried out in any way. It&#x27;s... just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was kind of enjoying bottled soap that I could squeeze into a loofa. But I can rub these bars into a loofa and get enough soap to do the job. The bars look thicker than some. I once tried Dial&#x27;s Gold Antibacterial soap. The bar was thin, looked like it was made of the plastic of an action figure/doll and while the smell wasn&#x27;t overpowering, it wasn&#x27;t pleasant either. The Safeguard looks like a Monster Truck compared to the Dial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others have said, it&#x27;s been hard to find this soap. I can&#x27;t remember where I last was in which I couldn&#x27;t find it - it was a CVS or similar place. But I did find it at my Pathmark (along with my favorite deodorant, whatta ya know?). So I suppose try your local supermarket if you want to buy it in your area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note 1: I&#x27;m reviewing the version WITHOUT the aloe vera, but I&#x27;ve tried that one too. It was alright, but I prefer this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note 2: I find it disconcerting that the version here, which has a beige/tan color, appears to not be listed on the Safeguard Soap website. I hope the reason it&#x27;s hard to find it not because it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best soaps that I ever use. I try not to use anything else but this soap. I would recommend it to anyone. I give it two thumbs up</li>
    <li> Love it. Fantastic Soap! I have tried numerous brands; but this one is the best!! Definitely worth the money too..</li>
    <li> The only soap my family will use.  It is getting hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  It lathers nicely, smells great, and leaves no residue.  Makes the skin feel really fresh and clean.  My new favorite!</li>
    <li> I have Melanoma and this seems to be the only soap that doesn&#x27;t bother my skin at all. Love the clean smell and this was a great competitive price with fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap since I was a kid. It&#x27;s kind of hard to find it where I live but fortunately it&#x27;s available in Amazon. It lasts longer than any other soap I&#x27;ve used and the scent is not very strong. Its antibacterial feature is a big plus over plain scented soaps. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> What can I say about Safeguard soap . . . it gets you clean and leaves you smelling freshly washed.  There is no soap scummy feeling, so it rinses well.  And it&#x27;s antibacterial which is a plus in these days.  We have used it for many years and are very satisfied with the way it cleans and leaves you feeling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years but had been purchasing it at a local grocery or discount store. When I checked Amazon and found that I could buy it in \\&quot;bulk\\&quot; at a much lower price-per-bar, I immediately bought the 24-Pack. After all; it&#x27;s not as though I&#x27;ll not use them all!!</li>
    <li> For 13 dollars you get 24 bars of soap. The price value alone makes this a great buy. But the real reason I bought this is because of the antibacterial factor of it. I work in an environment that is high in germs and bacteria and I wanted a soap that could cut down my chances of bringing something home. I have tried other soaps that left my skin itchy, made my skin feel unclean/dry or had an industrial smell. This soap leave my skin feeling clean and I no longer experience after shower itchiness. The soap has a nice clean smell to it and does not smell like a lab soap. I am happy with my purchase and when my 24 bars are finish I will order another 24.</li>
    <li> I have tried several different types of deoderant soap and Safeguard is by far the best available.</li>
    <li> Safeguard Antibacterial Soap is always my soap of choice. After every use I feel clean and refreshed, but not dry and irritated. I would heartily recommend this soap to just about anyone. I&#x27;ve been using Safeguard Soap for several years and have not been disappointed. Happy Washing!</li>
    <li> Great soap, great price and I got free shipping with SUPER-SAVER SHIPPING. Essentially, it was cheaper than driving to Wal-mart to purchase.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I was having difficulty finding Safeguard soap in the stores, so I searched on line.  Not only did I find what I was looking for, but I could buy a lot of bars of soap at a reasonable price.  Delivery was quick &amp; free as well.  I&#x27;ll always buy my Safeguard soap this way from now on!</li>
    <li> I use this soap all the time because it leaves a nice clean smell to safeguard your skin. I don&#x27;t recommend using it on small kids as it may be to strong for their skin. I think all adults will love the fresh feel left with them after using this soap.</li>
    <li> The picture in the description is the safeguard bar soap that has 1.2% triclocarban.  I specifically bought this because the item pictured is the 1.2% version but what you get is the .75% version which is different from the box pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They should change their picture and specify the triclocarban concentration.  It matters when you are looking for a certain strength.</li>
    <li> For some reason bar soap is not in our local stores. If you use Safeguard then you can&#x27;t go wrong with the purchase of this product.</li>
    <li> This is the soap that I use the most for bathing. It does not seem to leave any noticeable residue nor does it dry my skin in the winter. I paid under $20 for three 8 packs. I see that much more is being charged for this soap by some sellers. Don&#x27;t over pay. It is available at Walmart for a much lower price. It is not a good value at more than $20 for THREE 8 packs.</li>
    <li> These soap bars work fine for us, as usual for Safeguard soap, and I cannot add further to the discussions about active ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped needing to use daily deodorant after I began washing my feet and underarms with this soap.  The old safeguard, and perhaps this as well, is to harsh for me to use all over, a dermatologist told me to keep a different soap in the shower for washing all else.  We only use the beige color to distinguish between this and the other soap in the shower, which is a beauty bar type such as Dove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really reduces bad smells in my husbands feet and socks, even in summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;24 bars is enough to last us for way to many years, but this is the same price as what you pay to get only 8 bars with shipping, and we have plenty of storage space for the extras..</li>
    <li> Always have used Safeguard antibacterial soap and have had very few colds, viruses, or any other common ailments.</li>
    <li> Product arrived promptly and without any damage to package. I&#x27;ve been using this soap for many years. It keeps me squeaky clean, yet doesn&#x27;t kill my skin. I recommend both this supplier and this soap- if you like bar soap</li>
    <li> This product works perfect for my oily skin. In winter the skin becomes too dry, but I apply some mild moisturizer. Have been using this product for a while now (almost 4-5 years).</li>
    <li> Good grime removal, rinses clean. I guess it is a mild bactericide. No way for me to test. Very good basic soap. I am a guy. I like the fresh scent without perfume smell or oily feel.</li>
    <li> Good for your skin and protects from body odor longer than any other soap...Try it, you&#x27;ll like it...Has a handy shape...</li>
    <li> Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> To me after trying different soaps for 53 years of my adult life.This soap makes me sqeeky clean and smell that way all day.I will settle for no other soap.At any time.</li>
    <li> I use this to pre-treat stains. From my husband&#x27;s collar stains, my kids food stains, markers, pen marks, paint, poop, pee, even blood from their boo boos! Works great!</li>
    <li> I am a 44 year old female who, for various reasons, sweats a lot.  I have tried many products to manage this issue, so that I do not look like a sweaty mess when I am at work (which is not ideal for obvious reasons).  I use Shower to Shower deodorant powder (works great) along with clinical-strength deodorant.  I used Lever 2000 soap, but just never felt clean or smelled clean enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember that I used this as a child/teenager and always liked it.  Not sure why I stopped using it years ago, but when I saw that it was antibacterial, I thought that I would give it a try again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, what a difference!  I can&#x27;t believe how much cleaner that I feel and smell.  I feel clean and I smell clean.  And, it lasts all day.  I have also started using this on my feet and it helps a lot with the odor and cleanliness, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that this product includes Triclosan, which is currently causing some debate about whether it&#x27;s safe or not.  I can appreciate that, but for me, really, what is safe or not? I don&#x27;t know.  I only know that this works better than anything else that I have tried and really helps with my confidence.  I ordered 3 packs of this 8-pack of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, one bar lasts much longer for me than any other soap that I have tried, including Level 2000.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for years and loved it. When I couldn&#x27;t find in stores any longer I turned to Amazon and of course found it there. Little things can mean a lot!</li>
    <li> I like the antibacterial quality which kept me from smelling mildewed when I lived in Phoenix.  I&#x27;m an old creature of habit, and I hate it when a manufacturer replaces my favorite products with something I don&#x27;t like.  This is one of the few places you can still get Safeguard soap, if you can even still get it here.</li>
    <li> The box arrived a bit smashed, but the product was fine. So happy to have my favorite soap in the house. It is so hard to find at Target and other stores. Thanks!</li>
    <li> These 24 bars are very cheap and very good for cleaning bacteria from your hands and body. I think the price is very competitive and you cannot get it else where than Amazon. I probably will not buy again until next year, since there are so many bars in the package.</li>
    <li> We searched for the kind of soap that would leave a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeing after rinsing it off, rather than &amp;#34;slippery smooth&amp;#34;, and bought this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it doesn&#x27;t feel slippery at all after use, but the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeing feels very fake, it&#x27;s like there&#x27;s a thin &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; layer of chemicals on your hand, to reduce slipperiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, my hand never felt dry while using another brand, but the back of my hand had small cracks and hurt after a few days of using this! Had to apply a lot of lotion after each use now, and I regret buying 8 of this soap at one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, antibacterialwise I guess it serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> Have found it hard to purchase in local stores lately so I stocked up at a reasonable price and am still satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> Always use this brand&lt;br /&gt;great value</li>
    <li> Safeguard has been a long-time favorite of my husband.  The scent is not as strong as some antibacterial soap bars.  Safeguard lathers well, rinses well and leaves you smelling clean, not perfumed.  Very convenient ordering 3 packages of 8 bars to stock up.  Amazon&#x27;s price was good.</li>
    <li> perfect for use when an antibacterial soap is needed.  great for everyday and doesnt dry your skin out.  the scent is also pleasant</li>
    <li> This is the only brand we all can agree on.  I started using subscribe and save for this item and am glad I did.  Saving trips to the store and saving money!  The best of both worlds.</li>
    <li> I like this soap - it&#x27;s a deodorant soap that doesn&#x27;t have an exceptionally strong or medicinal odor.  It gets you clean.</li>
    <li> Excellent price.  The beige can be hard to find in stores.  Like it better than the white bars.  Safeguard gives a good clean feeling without any buildup.  The whole family uses it.</li>
    <li> Look, i ride a bike a lot, and sweat a lot, so i need something that cleans very completely and prevents the occasional road rash from becoming something major. You will not smell like avocado birch with shea butter after showering with this. But you won&#x27;t smell at ALL like you did when you got into the shower which is likely all your significant other is hoping for.</li>
    <li> I love this soap so much I have it on auto order.It smells so clean and lathers so nice on a regulat wahcloth it really feels like it&#x27;s better than all the rest.</li>
    <li> I love Safeguard soap.  I wish I could find it in the larger size bar but the bath size will do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for a long time. Always the same, and always gets new clean. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of moisturizers or a strong scent. Just a mild fresh scent, nothing fancy.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years, love it.</li>
    <li> We used this soap for years, eventually getting it from Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save program.  It left us feeling clean, it smelled good, and it was cheaper than Dial.  However, we stopped using it at the beginning of this year after learning about triclosan (the active antibacterial ingredient) and the concerns about its safety in everyday use.  Major companies, like Johnson &amp; Johnson, are discontinuing the use of triclosan in their products because of these concerns.  So although we didn&#x27;t notice any ill effects, I would rather be safe than sorry in this case.  We switched to a regular, non-antibacterial soap.</li>
    <li> I grew up using Safeguard antibacterial bar soap.  I like the way it smells, probably because I grew up using it.  I also like the way it does NOT leave a colorful residue on the surface on which it rests.  For the past several years, I have had a very hard time finding this soap in my local supermarkets and pharmacies.  I have used many other brands of antibacterial bar soap in the meantime, mostly Dial, and have not found another that I like as well as this old favorite.  When I found that Amazon was selling bulk packages of classic Safeguard Antibacterial Bar Soap, I was very excited and immediately purchased some for my household.  Thank you Amazon for making this soap available to me once again!</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for at least 25 years and it is becoming increasingly difficult to find it so now I just have it delivered to my door every couple of months.  I have had a lifetime of scent sensitivity and this is the only deodorant soap  that doesn&#x27;t cause a migraine.  Last time I an out I searched store after store for it and them I finally checked Amazon and they had it available.</li>
    <li> Very good brand of soap.</li>
    <li> Love my soap very happy with this product and great services thank you</li>
    <li> For the price, it&#x27;s worth it. I pay triple the price where I live for 1/4. Anyone who has used Safeguard before will not be disappointed. Definitely recommended if you too have to deal with overpriced drug stores near you.</li>
    <li> The product is the best that you can buy.</li>
    <li> I love this soap and, for some reason, am having a hard time finding it in stores. This shipment consisted of wonderfully fresh soap...and I even had a choice of colors which I never see in stores if I am lucky enough to happen upon it at all. Just a great product...smells nice, not too harsh, keeps me feeling clean all day.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Hard to find in local stores. x x x x x x x x x x x x</li>
    <li> I love Safeguard soap. Great fragrance, and it gets me squeaky clean and leaves me feeling very fresh. The Safeguard I received from Amazon just a few days ago is no different in that regard. However, the Amazon listing specifies that this is the 1.2% Triclosan (Triclocarban) version of this product. It isn&#x27;t. The product that was shipped to me (and based on the review currently rated as most helpful, apparently to at least some others as well) is the 0.75% Tricolsan version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lower Tricolsan content is not a deal breaker for me. There&#x27;s some dispute about how effective/beneficial Tricolsan actually is when it comes to eliminating bacteria on the human body and also some interesting debate about whether or not Triclosan actually has the potential to be harmful in humans. On that front, the lower Triclosan content may be a blessing in disguise. That said, I&#x27;m rating this three stars for the description error until Amazon corrects it. The product described should be the product you get, and in this instance that is not the case.</li>
    <li> My mother was very pleased and surprised when she saw the price on these bars of soap. A pack of three for such a cheap price, that&#x27;s unbeatable. She won&#x27;t have to buy soap until the end of this year hopefully. A amazon, you win again.</li>
    <li> If you are the same type of guy like me who cannot stand the dove and other &amp;#34;fashion&amp;#34; &amp;#34;skin protection&amp;#34; and self advertised &amp;#34;nutritious &amp;#34; type soap that will leave sitcky or silky additives on your skin, then you&#x27;d better hurry in and get these packs, they are cheap and good and does what a soap supposed to be doing and some more: to protect you from bacterials.&lt;br /&gt;What more do you want !!? From a Soap!!</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY soap that one of my friends use, so I gave as a gift.  I&#x27;ve used this item several times in the past, but I now use other gels and body wash.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for at least 40 years. It&#x27;s antibacterial, has a clean scent and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.  I even use it on my face with no ill effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For several months, I&#x27;ve been unable to find it in the stores around here even though the company said some of them carry it.  I decided to try amazon.com and there it was! I just had to get a large pack.  Smaller packs are available if you prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002ZJW1VA Safeguard Antibacterial Bar Soap, 8 Count, Beige, 4.0-Ounces Packages (Pack of 3)]]</li>
    <li> I purchase this through Subscribe and Save and love getting this soap at an affordable price and on a regular basis.  The soap is very good and we have no complaints with it.  Love the Subscribe and Save....get many household items through the program.</li>
    <li> I love safeguard because it kills bacteria. I have 2 cats in the house, and I need this soap all the time. I&#x27;m so used to it now! It doesn&#x27;t damage my skin like some other soaps do, though due to the frequent washing (and I wash my hand a lot), I still get dry skin, but not as bad. I recomment this soap!</li>
