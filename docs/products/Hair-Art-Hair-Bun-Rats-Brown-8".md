      <li>have tried others and keeping using this one that is older because is the best</li>
      <li>Its great for a large bun.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Also, I saw the snaps in the picture but not in the description, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect - it has snaps, and now I will be using it as a bun roller rather than a rat for the 1940s</li>
      <li>I love this thing.  </li>
      <li>Well, what can I say, it&#x27;s a hair rat :)</li>
      <li>The Hair Art Hair Bun Rat 8\\&quot; works well and makes an excellent French twist.  </li>
      <li>LOVE IT</li>
      <li>Thank goodness for this hair rat :-)</li>
      <li>She was able to do her hair herself in under 3 minutes amd</li>
      <li>and it is the only one that gives you a perfect bun in seconds</li>
      <li>I have long hair, and it makes an awesome bun.  </li>
      <li>I have to say that it looks to be a fantastic size for a hair donut though :)</li>
      <li>EASY TO USE.</li>
      <li>Easily takes bobby pins too</li>
      <li>It is quite easy to use as well.  </li>
      <li>This is a fun toy to have for your hair!</li>
      <li>originally bought it for bumper bangs</li>
      <li>My daughter has super fine hair and quite a bit of it.</li>
      <li>It does it&#x27;s job, it seems to be of adequate quality to here&#x27;s hoping it lasts.</li>
      <li>This is the key to the Betty Paige bumper bangs that are so popular and</li>
      <li>The hair falls right off it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m buying another one right now.  </li>
      <li>with my very fine hair, it&#x27;s a bit too big.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not connected to the sponge very well.</li>
      <li>It takes too much time to get the look you want.</li>
      <li>&quot; would have been *much* too</li>
      <li>Makes my life so much easier when doing a vintage up-due.</li>
      <li>and it was wicked fast to arrive.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a rat that is made with real hair.  </li>
      <li>My fiance loves the whole rockabilly/40&#x27;s and 50&#x27;s scene</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>I had purchased one several years ago, but so far have not been able to find another one.  </li>
      <li>I think as I&#x27;ll get more practiced I&#x27;ll have less of the rat</li>
      <li>This hair item was so cheap and too difficult to use effectively.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was really unsure about the length, 6\\&quot; would have been too short for the bumper-bangs I wanted to make with the hair rat, 10\\</li>
      <li>Works great to make fake bangs, buns, and other pin-up hair styles</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a little darker than I expected from the picture, on my monitor the color more closely resembles the shaded part of the picture.&lt;br /&gt;Because of the length and the color you can see it a teensy bit in the bumper bangs, the only reason this product doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but this rat is a little too large for that in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;SUPER</li>
      <li>/&gt;To be quite honest, after two tries I think 8\\&quot; is a tad bit too long for my (really thin) shoulder-length hair.</li>

    <li> works great for bumper bangs</li>
    <li> Bought this for a 50&#x27;s Pin Up Bachelorette party. It does the job for the PERFECT vintage BUMPER BANGS!!! LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Perfect lenght and width&lt;br /&gt;I have tried others and keeping using this one that is older because is the best and it is the only one that gives you a perfect bun in seconds</li>
    <li> I bought this for the purpose of keeping it snapped into its round shape for a bun form. Maybe my hair&#x27;s too thick or something but it has never stayed snapped for me to finish making my desired look.</li>
    <li> I love this thing.  I&#x27;m buying another one right now.  I have long hair, and it makes an awesome bun.  It takes about 10 seconds to do my hair and get it out of my way.  Love this hair bun thing!  Awesome.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a rat that is made with real hair.  I had purchased one several years ago, but so far have not been able to find another one.  These do not work for me at all, I pin one side and the other side goes loose, they just do not work.</li>
    <li> My daughter has super fine hair and quite a bit of it. I was concerned that this was maybe to long but it came out perfectly. She was able to do her hair herself in under 3 minutes amd it came out awesome! There was some difficulty snapping it shut because it&#x27;s squishy but it just takes some getting used it. It also works great for the pompadour bangs and victory rolls no ratting required. Easily takes bobby pins too</li>
    <li> Much larger circumference than I expected, and with my very fine hair, it&#x27;s a bit too big.  Also, I saw the snaps in the picture but not in the description, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect - it has snaps, and now I will be using it as a bun roller rather than a rat for the 1940s look I was going for.</li>
    <li> I love it!  and it was wicked fast to arrive.  The only difficulty I have is that reaching behind myself to roll this size hair rat is not easy.  but the result is delightful and I think that I have to get some of the smaller rats for side coifs.  Wonderful product, responsive company.  I will order from them again.</li>
    <li> The Hair Art Hair Bun Rat 8\\&quot; works well and makes an excellent French twist.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Its great for a large bun.&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought it for bumper bangs but this rat is a little too large for that in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;SUPER EASY TO USE.</li>
    <li> My fiance loves the whole rockabilly/40&#x27;s and 50&#x27;s scene so I thought I would try to learn some if the hairstyles and I found this to be a must have for some of the styles.  This is the key to the Betty Paige bumper bangs that are so popular and it works great!!!  I bought a couple of them trying to see which variety would work the best and this one is definitely the winner.  It is quite easy to use as well.  Thank goodness for this hair rat :-)</li>
    <li> This is a fun toy to have for your hair! I used it to give me the perfect pin up hairdo for a party and it has now become a go to style!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a hair rat. It does it&#x27;s job, it seems to be of adequate quality to here&#x27;s hoping it lasts. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> I would not order this product.  The product did not snap close, even without putting it in my hair.  My product may have just been defective, but when I tried to return it, within the thirty day return period, I was notified that the seller has a very complicated return policy that they do not post on their adds. I would not recommend ordering this product or from this seller</li>
    <li> Works great to make fake bangs, buns, and other pin-up hair styles</li>
    <li> Makes my life so much easier when doing a vintage up-due. I need to get more of these! If you are thinking about it, I say go for it.</li>
    <li> After using this product twice, one of the snaps is already coming off. It&#x27;s not connected to the sponge very well.</li>
    <li> This was hard to use and I ended up tossing it.</li>
    <li> Well, what can I say, it&#x27;s a hair rat :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really unsure about the length, 6\\&quot; would have been too short for the bumper-bangs I wanted to make with the hair rat, 10\\&quot; would have been *much* too long.&lt;br /&gt;To be quite honest, after two tries I think 8\\&quot; is a tad bit too long for my (really thin) shoulder-length hair. I think as I&#x27;ll get more practiced I&#x27;ll have less of the rat showing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little darker than I expected from the picture, on my monitor the color more closely resembles the shaded part of the picture.&lt;br /&gt;Because of the length and the color you can see it a teensy bit in the bumper bangs, the only reason this product doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how sturdy the snap feels, but I have to admit that I haven&#x27;t tried using it as a hair donut yet. I have to say that it looks to be a fantastic size for a hair donut though :) (Was unsure about that because I had some trouble visualizing how big it would come to be when it was a circle)</li>
    <li> This hair item was so cheap and too difficult to use effectively. It takes too much time to get the look you want. Chucked it in the trash.</li>
    <li> It is difficult to clip and is not rough enough for hair to stick. The hair falls right off it.</li>
