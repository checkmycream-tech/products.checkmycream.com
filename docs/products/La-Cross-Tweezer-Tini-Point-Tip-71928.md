      <li>just grabbed, and pulled it right out.</li>
      <li>I have opened 2 packages now hoping the first one was just a fluke and an irregular.  </li>
      <li>I may buy more as gifts or simply so I have extras.  </li>
      <li>Good, but not amazing.</li>
      <li>I bought this same pair of tweezers about a decade ago, and it was great and obviously lasted a long time.</li>

      <li>The pointed tip is too thick... not slim and precise.</li>
      <li>This one says it&#x27;s pointed, but the point is not sharp enough to grab hairs.</li>

<li> She went through several sets of other brands of tweezers until I found these for her through Amazon.  </li>
<li> It gets the smallest hair and it&#x27;s tight enough to get the job done in no time at all.  </li>
<li> This was in no way the item that I expected</li>
<li> They are small enough to carry in your pocket and they grab the hairs you need to pluck.  </li>
<li> On average I pay about $5 each.</li>
<li> Can grasp tightly and get out the tiniest hairs.</li>
<li> What a waste.</li>
<li> So I&#x27;m not sure what the hype is about.</li>
<li> Very small and compact, and it comes with a synthetic leather sheath (the black thing behind it in the picture).  </li>
<li> They do not sell them at the stores anymore, or at least I cannot find them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I read a bunch of reviews of here, boasting these as &amp;#34;THE BEST&amp;#34; -- I got them on sale for $0.99, so I&#x27;m hardly upset (and I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking at a price like that), but these are just generic crap tweezers.</li>
<li> Not sure what changed, but it doesn&#x27;t grip was well, making tweezing very frustrating.</li>
<li> Sad that companies feel the need to change their designs.</li>
<li> The sheath smells weird, but I got over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Too bad I can&#x27;t find them in any stores anymore.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m sorry that I got it!!</li>
<li> These tweezers are worthless.</li>
<li> /&gt;Sometimes a ingrown hair can get so annoying, that you have to dig them out, and break skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I  am very disappointed!</li>

    <li> This little baby gets all types of hairs - super fine to coarse, it will get anything! Awesome grip and size, perfect fit in my wallet.</li>
    <li> They work great, without causing skin damage !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes a ingrown hair can get so annoying, that you have to dig them out, and break skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With these tini tweezers, I didn&#x27;t have to struggle to grab the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just grabbed, and pulled it right out.</li>
    <li> These are the best tweezers I have ever used.  They are small enough to carry in your pocket and they grab the hairs you need to pluck.  if you haven&#x27;t tried them you should</li>
    <li> These tweezers are worthless. They don&#x27;t work for plucking eyebrows, anyways. Hair just slips through. I would not recommend these to a friend. What a waste.</li>
    <li> My favorite tweezers. Been using them for YEARS! They are the best for getting very very short hairs without breaking the hair! Grabs excellent from the root. I have tried a great deal of expensive tweezers and these are BY FAR the best. I&#x27;ve purchased in stores, Amazon, and EBay. On average I pay about $5 each. Definitely recommend. This is not a sponsored review.</li>
    <li> I have an old pair of these tweezers and wanted to get a new one.  Every store I went into I would look for another pair only to find them here on Amazon.  I bought 5 pairs, 1 to be given to my daughter who loved my original.  I thought these would last me a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;Something has changed.  They don&#x27;t grab onto the hair as well.  They feel &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34; at the point.  I have opened 2 packages now hoping the first one was just a fluke and an irregular.  Nope.  I keep going back to my original one that I bought years ago.  Sad that companies feel the need to change their designs.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to these awesome tweezer back in 2008.  I love them more than any other tweezer&#x27;s I have ever used. They do not sell them at the stores anymore, or at least I cannot find them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought two just in case I lose one, as I did when I had to order these.</li>
    <li> I love this tweezers!!!! They&#x27;ve discontinued this model in stores everywhere, so i was so happy when I found it here in Amazon!!!  This is the only one that helps remove the stubborn baby brow hairs.</li>
    <li> Been looking for these tweezers everywhere! Have very clean eyebrows from the Tini point tip.</li>
    <li> The best I&#x27;ve used. Outstanding gripping. Love the small size.</li>
    <li> I bought this same pair of tweezers about a decade ago, and it was great and obviously lasted a long time. However, my husband started using it so I wanted my own pair again. I purchased this expecting it to be identical, but it&#x27;s not as good as the original. Not sure what changed, but it doesn&#x27;t grip was well, making tweezing very frustrating.</li>
    <li> These suck! I must have purchased a dozen needle nose tweezers looking for a pair that can actually do the job. The pointed tip is too thick... not slim and precise. I&#x27;ll keep looking...</li>
    <li> Good, but not amazing.</li>
    <li> My wife bought a pair of these tweezers once on vacation, and they became her favorite tweezers.  She used them for several years, but then lost them.  She went through several sets of other brands of tweezers until I found these for her through Amazon.  She says the point tips on these are great, strong, and out-perform all other brands that she has ever tried.  AND, they have a lifetime guarantee!</li>
    <li> I was just looking for a really precise, useful tweezer. I read a bunch of reviews of here, boasting these as &amp;#34;THE BEST&amp;#34; -- I got them on sale for $0.99, so I&#x27;m hardly upset (and I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking at a price like that), but these are just generic crap tweezers. They don&#x27;t work any better or any worse than the ones you can buy for $2 on the shelf at any drugstore. So I&#x27;m not sure what the hype is about.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers on the market. Can grasp tightly and get out the tiniest hairs. Too bad I can&#x27;t find them in any stores anymore. I used to buy them at CVS, but they no longer carry them. I always look in every drugstore I go into, and nobody has them.  I bought several on Amazon so I have them for the future since everyone in my house loves them and they disappear from my makeup case alot.</li>
    <li> They can remove even the smallest hairs and they are of superior quality.  I ordered the Sally Hansen and the LaCross am very pleased with performance of both and would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I did not get the product in the picture!! This was in no way the item that I expected and I&#x27;m sorry that I got it!!</li>
    <li> I had purchased the same item a few years ago, and loved it. This one says it&#x27;s pointed, but the point is not sharp enough to grab hairs. I ordered 3 of them, and they are all the same. I  am very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Very small and compact, and it comes with a synthetic leather sheath (the black thing behind it in the picture).  The sheath smells weird, but I got over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be a very good EDC item.  I&#x27;m going to start carrying it around in my change pocket because there have been many times when I wish I had it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers themselves work perfectly.  They get a perfect grip on small hairs, and require very little effort to control.  Every time I&#x27;ve used them, it&#x27;s been a stress-free experience.  I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d work well for splinter removal, too.  I&#x27;d recommend longer tweezers if you&#x27;re going to do long-term detail work, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan of La Cross products, and this product definitely doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  I may buy more as gifts or simply so I have extras.  At the low price, it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> This tini-Tweeze is great.  It gets the smallest hair and it&#x27;s tight enough to get the job done in no time at all.  I absolutely love it!</li>
