      <li>/&gt;The quality of the bag looks good especially inside and the handles are not too heavy either.</li>

<li> The reason I am going for 2 stars is that they sent me the GREY bag (bottom of the bag outside is grey), I could not find any brown on the bag at all, the inside is some what yellowish as shown in the pic,</li>
<li> Needless to say I&#x27;m back to using an old black bag that hold everything in without bulging out.&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all... this is a great overnight/weekend purse for put clothes in if I need to stay overnight with family or friends, but not for everyday use (for me at least).</li>
<li> It is half the size it looks in the picture and very short, the gray area is smaller than in the picture as well as the white.</li>
<li> There are other colors from the seller, but different links, such as purple.</li>
<li> This bags looks big and spacious and beautiful on the model but when I received it, I was very disappointed.  </li>
<li> even the pic for BROWN has grey bottom</li>
<li> The purse was smaller than what i had expected it to be.</li>
<li> It is a very long time before we get.</li>
<li> Only maybe half of the size pictured .</li>
<li> Although the product shipped as quickly as they stated I am not impressed with the quality.</li>
<li> NOT WHAT I EXPECTED, WAS SMALL AND NOT DEEP ENOUGH.</li>
<li> Little smaller than pictured</li>
<li> Expected the bag to be a little bigger and</li>
<li> Mine is falling apart and I have only had it for a few weeks.</li>
<li> But not what i expected.</li>
<li> Ou just have to be careful with the chains.</li>
<li> The wife and I are very upset, because for a long time waiting for this bag, and it came very poor quality.</li>
<li> Not worth the money you spend</li>
<li> But non the less i did find use for it.</li>
<li> I always buy black purses because...</li>
<li> the handles to be a little longer.</li>
<li> I was expecting the bag to be a little deeper.</li>
<li> I guess I was hoping it would have lasted a little longer or was a bit stronger.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> black matches everything!</li>
<li> I regret very much that he bought a bad gift ....</li>
<li> What you get is a poor quality, very small fabric tiny tote....</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s not big enough very very disappointed</li>
<li> I was little sad that it wasn&#x27;t as spacious as shown in the picture.  </li>
<li> but I thought it was way bigger than that.. :(</li>
<li> I want to return back and get something else I am so mad and angry</li>
<li> Poor quality workmanship.</li>

    <li> The bag was smaller than the pic, and the chains break really easily. It is a strong product as far as holdubg lots of stuff though. Ou just have to be careful with the chains.</li>
    <li> The pics are misleading and I can now see why many reviewers say its smaller than they thought. The product description says the height is 13&amp;#34; which is true but IT IS INCLUDING THE HANDLE. The compartment which I measured is not more than 9&amp;#34;, so better be prepared for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the bag looks good especially inside and the handles are not too heavy either. The reason I am going for 2 stars is that they sent me the GREY bag (bottom of the bag outside is grey), I could not find any brown on the bag at all, the inside is some what yellowish as shown in the pic, even the pic for BROWN has grey bottom and I thought they just did not have brown pics and they have only grey pics and that I would get brown when ordered which clearly did not happen. There are other colors from the seller, but different links, such as purple.</li>
    <li> It looks great and it is just made cheap but I guess that&#x27;s why only paid 15 bucks for it!!</li>
    <li> The purse was smaller than what i had expected it to be. But it was still cute. I only wished that it was bigger because i like big purses.</li>
    <li> I am happy with the product. Expected the bag to be a little bigger and the handles to be a little longer. Shipping was very fast.</li>
    <li> This bag is TINY. the Picture and description of the bag makes it seem like a large spacious bag.. I will maybe be lucky if I can fit more than a book, wallet and phone in it.</li>
    <li> Do not get this bag. Mine is falling apart and I have only had it for a few weeks. The material is cheap and rips very easily.</li>
    <li> I ordered this handbag under the assumption it was as big as shown in the photo. The bag is much much smaller it&#x27;s child size and the quality is very cheap. I would send it back but it cost more to ship than purchased. I&#x27;ll be donating this bag to my 3yr old niece for playtime it&#x27;s just her size. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I always buy black purses because... black matches everything! I didn&#x27;t want a brown purse because I don&#x27;t have a lot of brown in my wardrobe, but I wanted something different. I was very excited when it came in. I was little sad that it wasn&#x27;t as spacious as shown in the picture.  I&#x27;ve always liked bigger hobo/tote purses. It looks very bulky and doesn&#x27;t close with all my stuff in it. Biggest items I have are my makeup bag (carries my compact, 3-pallet eyeshadow, blush and a couple of glosses and pencils) and my wallet. Needless to say I&#x27;m back to using an old black bag that hold everything in without bulging out.&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all... this is a great overnight/weekend purse for put clothes in if I need to stay overnight with family or friends, but not for everyday use (for me at least).</li>
    <li> well here is the story, I did not order this purse, however it does not look bad, but I do not like the idea of ordering and paying for something and you get an entirely different item. And on top of that the seller does nothing about it wants you to take off the review I wrote, Imagine getting mad for paying for something you did not order. Not even I&#x27;m sorry let me replace it for you. just please take off the bad review. I will never order from Ginkgo Store again. Watch out if you do.I don&#x27;t like the way they do business.</li>
    <li> Received very quickly, great condition. Price is excellent. Only thing bag looks much bigger in the advertised pictured compared to what we received.  I would list te description as medium size. Other wise, nice steady straps and shipping is pronto!</li>
    <li> Very beautiful and nice bag. In the picture it looks kind of bigger than it is. But it is made of very nice material and looks so cute.</li>
    <li> this bag is great for a diaper bag or getting out fast bad. didnt know inside was plastic but great use for diaper bag</li>
    <li> I love it but I thought it was way bigger than that.. :( Its awesome though and all my friends love it!</li>
    <li> Although the product shipped as quickly as they stated I am not impressed with the quality. I am going to give it to my nieces to play house with it I wouldn&#x27;t be caught in public with it.</li>
    <li> I was not happy when i got my package it was broken. They really need to put an actual picture of the item before others buy it. I suggest noone buy this at all.</li>
    <li> I was expecting the bag to be a little deeper. It&#x27;s a very shallow tote bag, but I guess you can not beat the price</li>
    <li> I ordered this bag thinking it was larger, I think the model sporting it must be a very tiny person.</li>
    <li> Weird textue... did not like it&lt;br /&gt;Material really bad&lt;br /&gt;Smells like nylon&lt;br /&gt;Looks very cheap&lt;br /&gt;Would not advise anyone to buy it</li>
    <li> Little smaller than pictured but i love it. Good quality. This bag was for my daughter and she simply loves this bag.</li>
    <li> it was&#x27;nt what thought it would be. But non the less i did find use for it. Thank u!!! I&#x27;ll still order item&#x27;s in the future.</li>
    <li> I purchased this bag with the hope of using it as I travel.  It was smaller than the picture led me to believe and the quality of the material is substandard.</li>
    <li> i ordered this bag from two days,,it isnt delivered yet,,but i checked my order track now,,the picture of the bag is changed,,it was white*gray,,now i find another one.Im afraid that the wrong one was chipped !!!!</li>
    <li> The worse item I ever got from Amazon, this bag should be remove. The photo they use it&#x27;s NOT WHAT YOU GET!!! What you get is a poor quality, very small fabric tiny tote.... Not worth the money you spend</li>
    <li> Item no where near the size pictured . Only maybe half of the size pictured . It&#x27;s not even worth the returning</li>
    <li> Like it. But didn&#x27;t realize the straps are very short and the inside is not a dark color. It will do for now.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a nice bag if you like tote&#x27;s. could be used for shopping .  i used it to carry towels  to the beach.</li>
    <li> This bag is cute I&#x27;ll give you that but I wanted to use it for work but it is very small and the quality of threading isn&#x27;t that great either after two weeks the bag started falling apart I woudnt recommend this purchase at all</li>
    <li> Handbag is not the same size as shown on model. Deceiving advertising. Poor quality workmanship. PU Leather smells. cheap quality.</li>
    <li> my wife order it and it looks nice its cheap and nice for woman who like style great product !</li>
    <li> this bag is very differente from the picture in the size... it is nice... but I wanted a big one...</li>
    <li> Does not look like the picture is much smaller then what it looks on the picture and looks cheap!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;If I knew I would have not spent 19.99 for it.</li>
    <li> I have used this bag daily since I received it to bring my lunch and paperwork home and back to work.  It is already starting to fall apart around the straps.  I guess I was hoping it would have lasted a little longer or was a bit stronger.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually impressed with this bag. I like how it carries when its on my shoulder. Its reminds a bit of the [[ASIN:B007R2HQZQ Alicia Klein Hope Handbag]], which is a good thing. SO I definitely recommend this bag, especially if you are looking for a sturdy.</li>
    <li> Well first off the bag is nice but it is not as the picture portrays it to be it is must smaller.</li>
    <li> This bags looks big and spacious and beautiful on the model but when I received it, I was very disappointed.  It is half the size it looks in the picture and very short, the gray area is smaller than in the picture as well as the white. This bag should be removed from Amazon or a true picture taken of the bag.</li>
    <li> Its cute and all. material is nice. It was even shipped two weeks before the delivery time! But not what i expected. Its actually smaller than in the image posted above.</li>
    <li> Hi! I bought my wife a bag, wanted to please her. It is a very long time before we get. My wife once wore it. Potrebalas bag, pen broke. The wife and I are very upset, because for a long time waiting for this bag, and it came very poor quality. It can no longer wear!!! Why would you sell a product for once?? What do I do with this bag?? I regret very much that he bought a bad gift ....</li>
    <li> Daughter purchased as a book bag for school and she loves it.  Time will tell with her usage through the months, but cannot beat the price.  Looks just like the advertisement on line by way of color and design.</li>
    <li> i well thought that this purse was big but it is actually not I want to return back and get something else I am so mad and angry</li>
    <li> WHEN I RECIEVED THE HANGBAG FOR 1,IT&#x60;S NOT WHAT I EXPECTED, WAS SMALL AND NOT DEEP ENOUGH. AND THE MATERIAL LOOKED PLASTIC. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO FRIENDS</li>
    <li> This bag is nothing like the picture it&#x27;s smaller and the lining is cheap I loved the photos of it thought it would be s great all purpose bag but it&#x27;s not big enough very very disappointed</li>
    <li> I was hoping it was something a bit bigger and more roomy. It seems to be more fit as a small beach bag and not so much as a purse. If I had known, it wouldn&#x27;t have been something I would have paid more than $10 for.</li>
    <li> Love it looks great with sun dresses.  Thanks so much for packing it so well. Have a great day! Thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this bag because i thought it looked cute. It was smaller than i hoped it would be but cute enough to keep. EXCEPT the cloth strap was broken when it arrived. Soooo disappointed.</li>
    <li> The product is great but it wasn&#x27;t as big as I thought it would be but I still love it</li>
    <li> My straps came apart.  I thought based on the picture that the bag was much larger than it actually was.</li>
