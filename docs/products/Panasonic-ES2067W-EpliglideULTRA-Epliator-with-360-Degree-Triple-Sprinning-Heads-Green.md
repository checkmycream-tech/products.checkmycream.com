      <li>Unless you&#x27;re happy with shaving most of your body, this is the most cost-effective way of removing unwanted hair.  </li>

      <li>It comes with a shaving attachment too, which I honestly have never tried.</li>
      <li>With this, you buy it one time and then keep up your own hair maintenance in the privacy of your own bathroom.</li>
      <li>Ok, I just got this today and just tried it out for the first time - and I cannot believe how awesome it is!  </li>
      <li>Unfortunatelly i was no where near impressed!</li>
      <li>It is so nice having baby smooth skin for days and weeks!</li>
      <li>This is the 4th Epilator I have purchased and it is the best so far for my legs.     </li>
      <li>so I have to use it fairly often, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
      <li>There was some discomfort when I first used it, but nothing compared to the pain I experienced when I used the Epilady years ago.  </li>
      <li>I love that the epilator and razor can be used in the tub or shower.</li>
      <li>I like the Panasonic a LOT better.</li>
      <li>I think I bought this from QVC many years ago.</li>
      <li>I am glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>Works quicker and better than a No</li>
      <li>It pulls out hair in all directions causing too many ingrowns.</li>
      <li>I find that I have to hold the unit still over an area to get most of the hairs removed.</li>
      <li>LOVE produce.</li>
      <li>Met my expectations and more.</li>
      <li>but it has been an inspiration for me to wear as many dresses, skirts, and shorts</li>
      <li>It made it feel more like an exfoliating massage after a while.</li>
      <li>on Overstock any more either.</li>
      <li>Ok, so there are some things you should know about me -</li>
      <li>None of them are perfect, but this one does remove the most short hairs.   </li>
      <li>the more you use it.</li>
      <li>against the sink to shake out more hairs.</li>
      <li>:)    </li>
      <li>the tenderness and bumps go away as you use it more and your skin gets used to it.</li>
      <li>:)    </li>
      <li>I just can&#x27;t tell you how glad I am that I purchased this product</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s ok to dunk it.</li>
      <li>Does not grab hair, so many attachments cant figure out what to use first!!!  </li>
      <li>The interchangeable heads are nice and all are easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>Did I mention I love having baby smooth skin?</li>
      <li>recommend the Panasonic to those that want love smooth, hairless legs but do not want to spend 2-3 minutes shaving in the shower every cotton-pickin&#x27; day.</li>
      <li>recommend the Panasonic to those that want love smooth, hairless legs but do not want to spend 2-3 minutes shaving in the shower every cotton-pickin&#x27; day.</li>
      <li>I bought this primarily for my legs, but i use it much more often on my underarms.</li>
      <li>I have tried 3 other epilators and this one was the best.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used epilators for years and strongly recommend them as an alternative to shaving.</li>
      <li>I like to lightly rub conrnstarch baby powder under my arms or on my thighs before I epilate so the unit glides easily.</li>
      <li>So, I searched and searched until I found this exact same one again because it is the BEST!!!</li>
      <li>The 90 degree thing is important.</li>
      <li>Would have been 5 stars if faster or more powerful, although that might undo the gentleness of it.</li>
      <li>Bubble bath and lilac shave gel makes it more fun.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product.</li>
      <li>Light a candle.</li>
      <li>Keeps your legs smooth and if you use spray tan or liquid type tanners, we all know shaving takes it off, well this doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>But it works and leaves smooth skin.</li>
      <li>But, it is SO lightweight and comfortable in Either hand.   </li>
      <li>great product does the job, this is the second one I purchased.</li>
      <li>That being said about the legs, the spinning heads were WONDERFUL for underarm hair and actually worked really well.</li>
      <li>The product is good for the most part - hands, legs - esp for hands &amp; under arms where hair grows in different directions...</li>
      <li>I can quickly dispense with unwanted hair and get on with my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes apart easily for removal of depilated hair and cleaning.</li>
      <li>I will probably get the hang of it better as I go along because this is my first epilator.</li>
      <li>to use, friendly and knock punch</li>
      <li>The only part I am not too happy is the trimmer head, it did not worked for me, maybe because I have never used one...but the pull out heads are good enough to pull out all your stubborn hair even after shaving for months the trick if you have stubborn hair</li>
      <li>First of all, you&#x27;re able to use it in the shower and out of the shower, but I advise using it after bathing.</li>
      <li>This is well worth the money!</li>
      <li>I will still wax and then use this to clean up after.  </li>
      <li>What I like  about this unit is the washable/rinseable factor to clean it.</li>
      <li>I don´t think I have ever been able to either wax or epilate two whole legs in</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this product about 6 months ago. I am glad I bought it. I&#x27;ve used an epilator before, but not recently until this product. Is slightly painful first use, but after that, hardly notice. I like the fact that the head, because of it&#x27;s 3 heads, covers a large area with each pass. I need to use about twice a week, one use is main \\&quot;clearing,\\&quot; second is to clean up hairs that were too small for previous use. The razor function does not work well for me. Don&#x27;t use the smaller head often.</li>
    <li> I had the smoothest epilation ever! I have tried 3 other epilators and this one was the best. None of them are perfect, but this one does remove the most short hairs.   I epilate after showering. There is pain, but if you do it every couple days there is less hair, so less pain. This also gets hairs that were missed previously.  If I could, I would change one thing on this epilator. Cord power and not battery power. It runs out of juice in 30-45 minutes. It does fully charge in 1 hour though.</li>
    <li> This epilator definitely works; however, it kills!....I bought this primarily for my legs, but i use it much more often on my underarms. I thought my underarms would hurt more than my legs, but it doesnt! The first time on my underarms hurt the most but after that it wasnt bad at all. However, my legs are a different story. The front part of my legs do not hurt that much but the sides and the back of my leg (calf area) absolutely kills!</li>
    <li> Works great!!!! Delivery was great also!!!!</li>
    <li> To a hair removal virgin using it will be painful... BUT if you have ever used threading, plucking, or waxing, this is a walk in the park. The shave wasn&#x27;t super smooth or close, the trimming awesome, and the epilating attachment left a few hairs behind. The spinning heads make it less efficient but a lot less painful. It made it feel more like an exfoliating massage after a while. I will probably get the hang of it better as I go along because this is my first epilator. I love the fact that its like 4 products in one! Overall the product was good but not amazing. If I buy another epilator it will probably be a straighter (probably more painful) one, that works better on leg hair.</li>
    <li> Before purchasing this Panasonic Epilator I&#x27;ve solely used the Braun Silk Epil variety. I like the Panasonic a LOT better. It&#x27;s gentler AND it gets more hairs out faster, possibly because of the three rotating heads. None of the three I&#x27;ve used over the years worked quickly, but this one is indeed fastest. The great thing is that although it takes a LOT longer than shaving, not only will your legs and under arms be much smoother, but you&#x27;ll see regrowth much less often. I use it once or twice a week now, although during the summer I do occasional touch-ups between uses. Yes it hurts like heck when you first use it, but after maybe a half dozen times you likely won&#x27;t be feeling it much at all, IF at all. All I feel at this point is a tiny tugging feeling. I can&#x27;t remember the last time I thought it hurt. The crazy thing though, is that I seem to pull out more hairs when I just barely touch the epilator to my skin. If I&#x27;m in any way pressing the epilator against my skin it doesn&#x27;t work as well. That&#x27;s different from the other epilators I&#x27;ve used, unless I was just using them wrong all along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the Panasonic can be used on wet skin and with shaving cream, but after a few times doing this I mostly went back to using it dry. When my skin is dry it just seems to go faster. However, I try to do it JUST after showering as the hairs are easier to pull, and it tends to lead to fewer of those temporary red dots you might see after epilating. I usually just sit on the side of the tub with a book in hand while I do most of the epilating; it makes using it less tedious and makes me feel like I&#x27;m just having a little me-time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That tiny attachment head that&#x27;s supposed to be used for your bikini line and your underarms doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot in my opinion. I just use the regular 3 head thing for that. If you find you you&#x27;re gouging your skin when you do the fold-y areas of your body, like under arms or behind your knees, keep in mind epilators work better (and make you bleed less, haha) if your skin is taut. Just like eyeliner goes on easier if you pull the side of your eyelid taut before applying, pull your skin taut with one hand and keep it taut while epilating. It takes a bit of practice but BOY is it worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------&lt;br /&gt;MAINTENANCE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned just three epilators in the last 20 years (boy that makes me sound old!), and that&#x27;s pretty much all I&#x27;ve used on my legs and under arms in that time. They can usually last a long time if you maintain them well. My current one that I&#x27;ve used for seven months still works like new. I don&#x27;t know what the instructions say about cleaning as it&#x27;s been awhile since I looked at them, but this is what I do. Please note: I almost solely use the three-head attachment, so my maintenance information is about that attachment in particular, but most these steps could be related to the other attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep an old toothbrush in my little epilator bag. Every 1-2 times I use the epilator, I take off the plastic three-holed cover that goes over the three heads, use the toothbrush to brush off the heads. This definitely works best when the epilator and heads are dry. Just brush, brush, brush the heads, then turn it on for a moment over a sink to let hairs you&#x27;ve brushed loose fall out. This also makes the heads rotate so when you brush the next time, you&#x27;ll be getting another part of the heads. Tap the epilator (gently!) against the sink to shake out more hairs. Repeat this 2-3 times. And for your sake and everyone else&#x27;s sake in your home, rinse the sink out well when you&#x27;re done. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably once every month or so I also pour a bit of rubbing alcohol onto the naked heads while it&#x27;s tipped with the heads facing so the alcohol can drip down into the sink without totally drenching the whole unit. You want to do this when whichever attachment you were using is off. When I do that I do the whole brush, brush, brush thing. This really seems to get off any residue that may be building up on the unit -- soap, shaving cream, a little deodorant, whatever. All that buildup really does build up, and if you don&#x27;t deal with it pretty soon the heads will be turning slower and slower, and not catching nearly as much hair as they used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty long hair (on my head) and once in awhile a hair will fall loose onto my leg while I&#x27;m shaving.  If this happens to you, you&#x27;re going to have to pry it out. The easiest way I&#x27;ve found is to take off whichever shaver attachment you have on it, then get a tweezers and gently pull the hair while turning one of the heads in reverse and it should come out pretty easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the Panasonic to those that want love smooth, hairless legs but do not want to spend 2-3 minutes shaving in the shower every cotton-pickin&#x27; day. However, if you&#x27;re a person that wants that but expect the results REALLY fast or completely pain-free from the get-go, this probably isn&#x27;t the product for you.ms to get off any residue that may be building up on the unit -- soap, shaving cream, a little deodorant, whatever.

    <li> Ouch. Just gave ingrown hairs</li>
    <li> Unfortunatelly i was no where near impressed! This epilator takes a long time to do it&#x27;s job. However, don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does pull out alot more hair than my old one.     In other words, i continued to use my old epilator...</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. It is so easy to use and no pain like previous epilators I have tried.  The shaver part is also great. The attachments are really handy. I just can&#x27;t tell you how glad I am that I purchased this product</li>
    <li> The first time I tried this epilator I wanted to pack it up and send it back. See I used it dry and let me say that was the worse pain i have ever felt. I have over 15 tattoos in several painful places and they did not compare to the pain this machine caused me. Then I tried it wet and OMG was there a difference. The water and soap help it glide and seems to lessen the pain. It is still painful, but manageable. It took me about 3-4 showers before I finally got all the hair off my legs (upper and lower), but the results lasted for weeks. Now I only have to do a quick epilate every couple of days or so. I am a Latina, so I have a lot of hair and it is thick. The new hair is thinner and smoother than it was with shaving. I am a happy customer.  I had a problem with razor bumps and ingrown hairs on my upper legs, and after using this I do not get them anymore. It is true if you get through the first round of epilating all your hair, the next ones are easier and way less painful.</li>
    <li> this product is less painfull than other epilators and does a better job.  well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Ok, I just got this today and just tried it out for the first time - and I cannot believe how awesome it is!  So awesome in fact that I had to come and leave a review.  At 5 in the morning.  I&#x27;m a college student, and it&#x27;s been a looooong night, and yet I went ahead and tried out what I thought would be a torture device?  Yeah, what can I say, must be the sleep deprivation.  But I&#x27;m so glad I did!!!    Ok, so there are some things you should know about me - I have never used an epilator before, I have never waxed, and in fact, I have never even shaved.  I&#x27;ve been blessed with the common Asian trait of little body hair, so I&#x27;ve always just relied on a dab of nair or veet to take care of things.  However, the only place I really needed hair removal were the underarms, and the creams just don&#x27;t do the trick!  And also, I am a TOTAL wimp when it comes to pain - I still live in horror of getting shots at the doctor&#x27;s, so yeah, after ordering this, I kinda thought there was a 90% chance I would try it once and never ever go near one again.    So anyway, I get in the shower, and I am so nervous, and I start cringing as I bring the epilator towards me, and I&#x27;m ready to scream, and then - nothing!  Just a little pinch!  I swear, I could not believe it!!!  I went ahead and did both underarms, and it seriously DID NOT HURT.  Anyway, I totally love this thing, and I would recommend it to everyone!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator.  I was a bit skeptical, but it&#x27;s great!  I chose this one because of the wet/dry use, but I rarely use it in the shower because it seems to work better dry, and I live in a dorm, and the noise is kind of awkward when showering in a stall next to someone...  I have light skin so after shaving you could still see dark spots, this solved the problem! It does break some hairs at the surface, and hair grows at different rates so I have to use it fairly often, but it&#x27;s worth it! You do get used to the pain.I really like the triple head, I rarely use the smaller head that is like most other epilators. This is well worth the money!</li>
    <li> well packaged, promptly shipped- good seller. Would do bus w/again.   LOVE produce. wish i had bought it ages ago it makes life simpler --   I USE it when lathered/slathered in the shower. DO NOT recommend it used dry - ouch. But, it is SO lightweight and comfortable in Either hand.   I have minor phys limitations - can not reach/see right... so shaving became a challenge -blood and all, you know -- so this wks GREAT...no blood at all! Just charge it then use it in shower.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months now.  I use it about every 3-4 days, just to pick up the strays that I missed.  I just got back from a 9 day trip &amp; I&#x27;m just now starting to need to use it agian.  The bikini area is a little sensitive, but if you go very slow it is OK.  The under arms are very sensitive &amp; I can only use it in the shower. The warm water seems to open the pores a little to help with the pulling. Over all I love this Epiglide &amp; would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> The epilator works well with the large attachment, but if you switch to the smaller one it is rubbish. It doesn&#x27;t get but 1 hair every now and then...RUBBISH!!  I only use the large attachment now, and I have gone back to waxing the other bits.  So, if you are interested in using the smaller attachment, then I say keep looking because you are bound to find something better.</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator ever. I&#x27;m surprised that it works so well. First of all, you&#x27;re able to use it in the shower and out of the shower, but I advise using it after bathing. I don&#x27;t epilate frequently, but I find that when I do it without bathing recently, it hurts a lot. Not only does it hurt, but there have been times where I&#x27;ve wound up with the occasional bleeding folicle. As for other matters: cleaning the epilator is easy. There&#x27;s a smaller epilation attachment that&#x27;s nearly useless, but the one pictured with the three rotating heads is fabulous. It comes with a shaving attachment too, which I honestly have never tried. I wish the product came with more than one cleaning brush, since mine is very frayed-looking. If you can find it, go for it. Fantastic product.</li>
    <li> I have very dark, course hair and while I love the option to do this in the shower, I wouldn&#x27;t attempt it again. I had this thing working on one leg for 20 minutes in the shower and I could barely tell a difference. It does not work nearly as well as the single spinning head epilators that I am accustomed to. That being said about the legs, the spinning heads were WONDERFUL for underarm hair and actually worked really well. It would pull a couple of hairs out at a time (not good for legs, but great for sensitive areas) which helped with the pain issue in the underarms but did a whole lotta not much for the legs. I am keeping it just so I can use it on the underarms in the shower, but I will most definitely be sticking with my Braun Silk-Epil for the legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, using this dry was much faster and more efficient (but still didn&#x27;t work very well)</li>
    <li> The product is good for the most part - hands, legs - esp for hands &amp; under arms where hair grows in different directions... Trimmer is decent too. Only problem is cleaning is not very convenient and the epilator stops spinning at times - no idea why. Even after replacement. Battery life is decent but disappointed with the fact that you can use it only when NOT plugged.</li>
    <li> totally out of imagination, those spinning ... do not work as good as my whole family expected. one word:unusefull.</li>
    <li> I thought I would try this out because it had other features I thought would help. I can feel the hairs being pulled out of my legs but it really does not hurt!  The armpits are another story.  I have tried it there 4 times and it is very painful for me.  I guess we all have areas that are more sensitive than other people.  I did not give this a five-star because it does take a long time, not really something that you can do the morning of (like with shaving).  I have gotten in the habit of doing it while I read a couple of times a week. I find I have to go in many different directions to get it pluck out all the hairs. The hair does grow back a lot softer.  Overall I am pleased but it is a different experience than shaving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used epilators for years and strongly recommend them as an alternative to shaving. This one is the one does not hurt or cause any irritation or red bumps like others I&#x27;ve tried.    It does however take a few more attempts to remove all the hairs than my old epilator.    The smaller feature for bikini area is fantastic and I&#x27;ve switched to that rather than waxing so I&#x27;m saving quite a bit every month!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I bought this epilator.  It does a great job on face, underarms and legs.I don&#x27;t travel without it</li>
    <li> I bought this after much research and suffering. It&#x27;s good. It&#x27;s less painful than my sister-in-law&#x27;s Remington &#x27;yank your hair out&#x27; item. lol    I have back problems and do much better leaning back in the bathtub than bending down to epilate or shave. Bubble bath and lilac shave gel makes it more fun. Yanking my hair out does hurt. Less pain each time, though.   Note: yanking out long hair hurts a lot more than short. Really.     I love that the epilator and razor can be used in the tub or shower. It doesn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s ok to dunk it. I didn&#x27;t dunk it. :)    The person who said to use the little epil attachment on your face seems to have been wrong. lol It hurt really bad, removed very little, and made my upper lip really red. Other than that, most of the scary warnings in the instructions are just lawsuit avoidance. :) I suggest you look at other women&#x27;s pointers for doing this effectively. The 90 degree thing is important. The pressure should be about like shaving with a 1970&#x27;s women&#x27;s shaver. If you&#x27;re too young to remember that, ask your mother. :)    I am as pleased with this as I could be with anything that takes up my time for something so silly in a world that needs peace. Life is good. Light a candle. Pray for peace.</li>
    <li> I occasionally wax my legs/bikini area, so it wasn&#x27;t too painful.  I have  never used another to compare this to, but I can tell you that it does break off some hairs, and pulls about 85% of the hair.  I will still wax and then use this to clean up after.  We women all know that waxing the bikini area is hard enough, let alone finding strays that didn&#x27;t get pulled, and that&#x27;s where this comes in handy.    The smaller attachment that comes with it specifically for bikini/underarm didn&#x27;t work good at all.  The three heads worked great for underarm area.  The hair in armpit area grows in every direction, likewise very hard to wax, but great with this epilator.   I really wish I could try the new one that emjoi makes to compare them.  Spending $40.00 for this wasn&#x27;t too bad, but would be very disappointed if I were to spend more and still have to wax.  I am certainly not downing the item, I have only used it once and could be that I need more experience.  Time will tell.....</li>
    <li> This Panasonic model is as close to painless as epilation gets.  This model has never pulled my skin into the spinning heads or made me bleed.  All of my other models did so regularly.  Unlike some of the other reviews I&#x27;ve read, I didn&#x27;t think this epilator required a lot of passes to catch all the hair.  It seems at least as efficient as the other epilators I&#x27;ve tried.  This is the first one I&#x27;ve owned that could handle getting wet.  That makes a big difference in the speed of the hair removal and the comfort- open pores mean easier and less painful hair removal.      My only problem with this epilator is that it eventually clogs and becomes useless.  The cleaning that the instructions tell you to perform does not make a difference.  It is so frustrating.  I&#x27;ve tried taking the epilation heads apart on two of my three epilators and I can&#x27;t get them to work at all once I put them back together. Granted, the instructions tell you not to do that.       I did do some research on the Panasonic website, and the only thing that I think might make a difference in making this epilator last longer is being obsessively careful about the length of the hair one removes.  Don&#x27;t try to remove hair that is even one-quarter of an inch too long.  Just read the instructions.    I just ordered my fourth of these epilators.  Even with the clogging, it is worth it.  Buying a replacement epilation head from Panasonic is more expensive than buying a new device from Amazon.  The $45 this costs on Amazon is a bargain, even if the whole device only lasts for four months.  Unless you&#x27;re happy with shaving most of your body, this is the most cost-effective way of removing unwanted hair.  I plan to use this epilator model until I can afford laser hair removal everywhere I want it.      In all, I would recommend this epilator to anyone.  I am extremely demanding of my epilators, using them at least twice per week.  For a person with more normal hair removal needs, I imagine this product would last much longer, especially if it is well cared for.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing. I have never owned an epilator before, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to but it has been an inspiration for me to wear as many dresses, skirts, and shorts as I can this summer. I am pregnant, and was really getting tired of bending over in the shower every other day to shave so I decided to toss in the money to see what one of these little devices can do. I am so satisfied! I guess it does kind of sting the first time you use it, but maybe I have a high pain tolerence because it really wasn&#x27;t that bad for me. I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because I think the bikini/underarm attachment is a bust. I couldn&#x27;t get much done with that attachment but I used the main one for my underarms anyway. I think the instructions actually tell you not to use that attachment for bikini/underarm but I had no problems.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s painful as hell cause it rips hair out by the follicle. But it works and leaves smooth skin. I dunno why women are afraid of spiders but not afraid of these things, but it works very well.</li>
    <li> I bought this article some year ago, up to now perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;easy to use, friendly and knock punch proof!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THK</li>
    <li> I used this product 7 times and it just stopped working. That was it. Not sure why but it just stopped.....would NOT recommend it!</li>
    <li> For the most part I like this product enough that I&#x27;m not going to return it. It&#x27;s relatively comfortable and quiet and I like being able to use it wet or dry. I&#x27;ve used 2 other epilators over the years and this one is the least uncomfortable to use.  The interchangeable heads are nice and all are easy to clean.  On the down side, I feel like the unit is underpowered when running the triple head-- it doesn&#x27;t seem to spin the heads fast enough to &#x27;grip and rip&#x27; efficiently. I find that I have to hold the unit still over an area to get most of the hairs removed. Gliding it around, even slowly, misses as much hair as it grabs.  The regular shaving head actually works the best. So, if you want a good wet/dry shaver and a so-so epilator this is a good choice. Otherwise, wait until Panasonic comes out with a turbo version.</li>
    <li> This is the 4th Epilator I have purchased and it is the best so far for my legs.     I purchased another Panasonic Wet/Dry, ES2045P, which was my first that could be used in the shower. It definitely helps to do it in the shower, and you can use soap to help it glide but this is better, at least for legs. I don&#x27;t use it for anything else so I can&#x27;t say.    I agree with some of the reviews that it does take a bit longer than for instance the Philips, which was the first one I purchased, but it is a bit of a \\&quot;tortoise vs. hair(e)\\&quot; race in that this does a better/more complete job, which means being able to go more days between, which means less time in total.     I often found that with straight line epilators (vs. this, which spins the heads) I was having to try many different directions to grab the hair, which is very tedious, especially in hard to reach places like hamstrings, and the bottom of your bottom.    The spinning heads have a spring loaded ring around them which allows for pressing down to make the skin taught in areas where the skin is covering areas that have a bit more fat, like the inner thing, than for instance the quadraceps. I&#x27;ve never been able to get as far up into the inner thigh with another epilator. I still can&#x27;t get all the way up because the skin gets looser all the way up, and it gets into pubic hair, which is just plain painful to remove.     The second attachment head is useful for making a straight line when removing some of the pubic hair above the genitals.    The only thing that keeps it from getting all 5 stars is it is not useful for the pubic hair between the genitals and leg. I believe this is because the skin is not taught enough in this part of my body.     Perhaps a single spinning head attachment would work for this, becasue the spring loaded ring would hold the skin taught.     One other note: I splash on witch hazel after the shower and a rub in a little Triple Anti-biotic cream in the pubic area/upper legs to reduce redness and minimize infection. It seems to have helped with reducing the occurance of acne that forms when the follicle is injured.</li>
    <li> I tried both the wet and dry methods.  I use both methods but prefer the dry.  There was some discomfort when I first used it, but nothing compared to the pain I experienced when I used the Epilady years ago.  The discomfort lessened with each use and now there is no discomfort at all.  I have been using it for four weeks now and I really like not having to shave my legs every other day.  No more nicks or cuts and my legs feel so smooth. Panasonic has some great personal care products and this is one of my favorites along with the bikini shaper and facial groomer.  Thank you Panasonic!</li>
    <li> I think I bought this from QVC many years ago. I had tried Brauns and Silk Epils before that. I have been epilating for around 20 years so nothing hurts anymore, thankfully. What I like  about this unit is the washable/rinseable factor to clean it. It has lasted far, far longer than any of my corded epilators, including the Emjoi double head that just died on me after not even a year of use. I like to lightly rub conrnstarch baby powder under my arms or on my thighs before I epilate so the unit glides easily. I think this eventually kills the corded ones that I can&#x27;t rinse. I have kept this Panasonic to use in between the dead epilators :) and when I used it today, I had forgotten how much I like it. It is slower, to me, and I think like another reviewer mentioned, it&#x27;s because it is so under powered when using the triple head, which is all I use. But it hurts less, even though I barely feel it anyway, gets more hairs - eventually - can be used in very delicate places because it really is more gentle, leaves no red bumps and can really be cleaned well. I also use a toothbrush, tweezers for longer stuck hair and debris that gets stuck in and around the heads and I too, tap it gently on the rim of the sink to dislodge any hair particles. This sucker just keeps on charging and working and I&#x27;m very glad it is still being made as I might buy another just in case! Would have been 5 stars if faster or more powerful, although that might undo the gentleness of it. Great product.</li>
    <li> I had high expectations, but disappointed overall:  - hair removal takes much, much longer than with a simple, one (longer) spinning head epilator - this is due to the short spinning heads.  - hair stuck in the spinning head which is very hard to remove (it&#x27;s also due to the small head)    Pros:  - in wet application the hair removal is surprisingly painless (which is very good!!!)  - no red dots after wet hair removal    I gave 3 stars, because the time is really an issue for me</li>
    <li> This works wonders on fast growing impossible to tame leg hair! I&#x27;m one of those unfortunate souls who has to shave every day during the summer and after purchasing this I will NEVER have to do that again! I&#x27;ve used it 3 times and the results typically last a week for me which is a big improvement. I won&#x27;t lie it HURTS but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I don´t think I have ever been able to either wax or epilate two whole legs in one go before buying this epilator. Im really happy with this purchase. Of course its a little painful, but far away from the pain by other epilators ive tried.  realy nice that one can use it under water, and that it creates a lather if you drip some soap on the heads.  This is the epilator I will actually use.</li>
    <li> Great product! Met my expectations and more. Very easy to use and does a great job.  I would recommend the Epilator to anyone wishing to get rid of unwanted hair.</li>
    <li> Love it and it made my life 10 times easier now instead of shaving my armpits ever second day if not more often I do it every week if not every second week</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned Braun epilators in the past, and those are OK, but I never felt they were very effective considering the amount of pain they caused. This Panasonic epilator is different. The three rotating heads ensure that all the little hairs are plucked out even if they are not growing in exactly the same direction as the hairs next to them, and it even seems to be less painful than other epilators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this thing six stars if I could.</li>
    <li> I bought this product around Christmas time of last year and I haven&#x27;t been sorry since.  I&#x27;ve waxed myself a couple of times and I was curious to see what this machine would do.  The shaving head works like a charm and it really does leave your skin smooth and soft without nicking it.  The smaller epilation head for the bikini and underarm area I prefer not to use.  For some reason it&#x27;s more painful than the triple head attachment.  I&#x27;ll use the triple head attachment for just about anywhere, but it&#x27;s important to remember that to use either one of the epilators, you MUST SHAVE FIRST. Give it a day or two for the hairs to start growing back in and THEN use the epilator.  Otherwise you WILL be in pain.  All in all, if used correctly and treated well, this product is indespensable.</li>
    <li> If epilation is your preference, this is the best device. It does my lip hair and (yes I wash it) it does a good Brazilian, if you have patience. The more you use it, the less it hurts. I don&#x27;t even feel my armpits when I do this anymore, but my upper lip and around the brazilan area can be sensitive. After your first use, the area may feel a little like a slight sunburn, and you may get some light bumps after a day or two. the tenderness and bumps go away as you use it more and your skin gets used to it. Hair does begin to grow out thinner the more you use it. It is so nice having baby smooth skin for days and weeks! Getting waxed is so expensive. With this, you buy it one time and then keep up your own hair maintenance in the privacy of your own bathroom. I used my first one for 5 years and then the battery went out. I just bought my second one. Here is the math: If I went to get a brazilian, and my pitters, and my legs and my lip waxed every 2 months, I estimate that is about $100 a visit, (plus someone else sees my bits!) I would spend $3000 over the course of 5 years. So if you learn to do it yourself, you save money and yourself the humiliation. Did I mention I love having baby smooth skin?</li>
    <li> Works quicker and better than a No No.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this epilator. I have gone through several different kinds of epilators and have found this one to be the best. It is the least painful of all epilators I have used and does a much better job. I wil use this epilator from now on.</li>
    <li> Panasonic ES2067W EpliglideULTRA Epliator with 360 Degree Triple Sprinning Heads, Green    This seller is absolutely perfect. Description is accurate and packaging as well as delivery before promised time made this experience uniquely appreciated. Thanks!  Lise</li>
    <li> Since I purchased this item I have not visited any salon for waxing is goo enough for my legs. The only part I am not too happy is the trimmer head, it did not worked for me, maybe because I have never used one...but the pull out heads are good enough to pull out all your stubborn hair even after shaving for months the trick if you have stubborn hair is to do the same area a couple of times ( so it may take a bit longer time) so do it when you are not in a hurry, overall: I am very please with it.It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> I had this epilator for over a year and a half and love everything about it.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad it is not available any more.Assuming mine will not last forever I would like to buy one more.&lt;br /&gt;Last summer I found them from seller on Ebay for a friend that couldn&#x27;t get it outside of US.Now it&#x27;s gone  from ebay too.&lt;br /&gt;None on Overstock any more either.Too bad :(</li>
    <li> I had the exact same product for about 4 years and it was stolen from me. So, I searched and searched until I found this exact same one again because it is the BEST!!! Please continue to make them because I woulld cry if something happened to this one and I couldn&#x27;t replace it.  I JUST LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple different epilator, desperately trying to find something that is comparable to the Epilady from the 90&#x27;s(?). Until now, all I had ever found were devices with two rows of depilating heads. Very time consuming and not all that effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three spinning heads harken back to that Epilady and perform much better than the two-row epilators. I can quickly dispense with unwanted hair and get on with my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes apart easily for removal of depilated hair and cleaning.</li>
    <li> Well, this product did what it was supposed to, but it hurt so badly I returned it.  If you are insensitive to pain, it might work for you.     To be fair, I also tried the Braun 5270 and that was just as bad.</li>
    <li> back and forth. decided I dont like it. Initially it irritated me so bad I thought I&#x27;d go into shock. Company was great and was going to let me return it. Then I got used to it. Now, 6 months later, newly married, I need a better job done if Im going to spend 20 mins, 3 times/week, yanking hairs out. Feel like shaving or electric shaver is not only quicker, but smoother, less painful, and better. yikes, dont even think about this on your bikini line or underarms unless youre a behomoth. glass of wine is a piece of advice Id have to agree with</li>
    <li> It pulls out hair in all directions causing too many ingrowns.Using the small attachment that came with it for tiny areas.&lt;br /&gt;Such a disappointment.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my legs after seeing a review on the net.  It took me a while to open it but when I did, what a surprise it was.  I never have to shave my legs now and I use this about once a week to start, now, about once every 3 weeks.  Keeps your legs smooth and if you use spray tan or liquid type tanners, we all know shaving takes it off, well this doesn&#x27;t.  love it!</li>
    <li> Does not grab hair, so many attachments cant figure out what to use first!!!  Nice product design!</li>
    <li> great product does the job, this is the second one I purchased.</li>
    <li> I have spent thousands of dollars over the years dealing with facial hair, including many clinical laser appointments and the like and nothing has worked as well for me as this epilator. It does require a high pain tolerance, especially for the first few sessions. It is definitely more painful than laser removal but has ultimately been a successful solution for me. I use it 2x a week or so and that is extremely effective.</li>
</ol>
