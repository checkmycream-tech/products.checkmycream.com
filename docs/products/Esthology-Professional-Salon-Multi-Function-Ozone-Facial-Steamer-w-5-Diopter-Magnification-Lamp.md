      <li>Works better</li>
      <li>My husband called and they did absolutely everything they could do to keep us happy.</li>
      <li>use it many times a day.</li>
      <li>I had the mag - light steamer combo for about 6 months and the power switch popped off, however, The customer service was just amazing.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>But you&#x27;re not getting more either.</li>
      <li>I even called to talk within them about this and did not get the most friendly employee.</li>
      <li>Ozone is a beautiful blue.</li>
      <li>I have asked the seller to just ship the magnifying glass arm as everything else works fine.</li>
      <li>Cheaply made item.....</li>
      <li>I received the product today (on time) but the light bulb was shattered.</li>
      <li>Just received this steamer as a gift for my skin care studio and so far so good.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>I called and the woman I spoke to was very calm and helpful</li>
      <li>Very pleased with the same day shipping, not to mention it was free!  </li>
      <li>It came originally from China with no breakage at all.  </li>
      <li>(though the phone lines were a bit of a pain, they did not go straight to the automated system, just kept ringing I had to call many times to get through).</li>
      <li>Steamer heats up quickly and works well.</li>
      <li>This is the second Multi Facial Steamer I bought from this company it works great, the price is very affordable and very easy to put together, it comes in a good double box package so nothing is damaged during shipping.</li>
      <li>And I was right.</li>
      <li>Nice and quiet, full steady stream of steam.</li>
      <li>Replacing the lamp with a LED light 5X and new switch bought from electric supply.</li>
      <li>, I plan on leaving it in the box until the new light bulb arrives.</li>
      <li>My only request is that there would be more directions for the product.</li>
      <li>I purchased the machine and the first day I received it...</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ve had comments on the blue light even!  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t get the lamp to work at first.  </li>
      <li>All three steamers have stopped working and the light completely broke off of two of them within two months of use.</li>
      <li>One broke in the first month .</li>
      <li>We actually ended up upgrading to a better model and paying the difference.</li>
      <li>She has had it for 2 years and absolutely adores this product !</li>
      <li>The lamp is not good quality and doesn&#x27;t hold on angle but steam works great but not the switch.</li>
      <li>I hope the company will ship a new product to me right away.</li>
      <li>The price was reasonable as well</li>
      <li>Very unstable.</li>
      <li>NO ONE WANTS TO COMMUNICATE WITH ME</li>
      <li>I decided to purchase a steamer that costs twice as much.....</li>
      <li>Packed very well.</li>
      <li>It works well in my salon and its very manageable.</li>
      <li>Even though there is a warranty I was told that I was responsible for shipping both ways.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Any help is much appreciated.</li>
      <li>and I really like the ozone</li>
      <li>I did not understand why because where the light attaches to arm broke on both, the attachment was flimsy to begin with, obviously defective.  </li>
      <li>But other than that, I like it.. :)</li>
      <li>I just wish maybe the timer could be a digital or being more quiet.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t purchase these for any high traffic spa or business.</li>
      <li>Even though it clearly states on Amazons product page that unit comes with 1 year warranty and before returning the lamps was told via e-mail from their customer service department that repairs would be covered under warranty and that I was just responsible for shipping.  </li>
      <li>I adjusted the arm of the lamp today and the whole arm came out and nearly fell onto my client.  </li>
      <li>AND I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO ORDER A NEW ONE EVERYTHING HAS FALLEN</li>
      <li>I bought this item several month ago to be able to perform 2 facial treatments at the same time at our spa.</li>
      <li>This thing is huge and heavy and will cost me a lot to return....</li>
      <li>the timer ticks too loud.</li>
      <li>the plastic used to cover each leg was so old that they were falling apart.</li>
      <li>DO NOT waste your money.</li>
      <li>So if you turn the lamp and the steamer arm to the same side, it seems top heavy on that side.</li>
      <li>Excellent quality and sturdy base.  </li>
      <li>I bought this along with the high frequency galvanic roller beauty facial skin care for my mother in law&#x27;s spa salon and she loves it</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend this facial steamer/mag lamp combo unit.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very pleased with the same day shipping, not to mention it was free!  Excellent quality and sturdy base.  Would highly recommend this facial steamer/mag lamp combo unit.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item and received a used item. I was so disappointed because the carton is large and heavy, they had a real cheap looking carton with holes in it, the we opened it and there was another carton, then another carton inside it. the Protective packaging was broken. By then I knew that this is not a new item. And I was right. when I opened the wheels showed wear on them like someone used them for months. the metal legs had markes on them indicating that they were assembled before. the plastic used to cover each leg was so old that they were falling apart. Then the unit itself showed that it has been used for a long time. You could see the residues of water minerals in the container.&lt;br /&gt;Bad supplier. They must think people are stupid.</li>
    <li> We recently sent back the lamp attachments to be repaired on two units.  Even though there is a warranty I was told that I was responsible for shipping both ways.  Once they received products they told me there is a repair fee?!?!  I did not understand why because where the light attaches to arm broke on both, the attachment was flimsy to begin with, obviously defective.  I asked why there was a fee since it was covered under warranty.  They responded that there was no warranty on the product.  Even though it clearly states on Amazons product page that unit comes with 1 year warranty and before returning the lamps was told via e-mail from their customer service department that repairs would be covered under warranty and that I was just responsible for shipping.  They told me they needed to talk to a manager and would get back to me.  After 48 hours of waiting I e-mailed again to ask if they had figured it out.  They finally responded that the fee was a deductible on the warranty!  They are completely taking advantage of us and there is not much I can do because they still have the lamps.&lt;br /&gt;So I just thought that people should know that the company actually selling the products through amazon is SUPER SHADY and being quite frankly, DISHONEST.  I&#x27;ve never had a company charge shipping both ways on their own defective product, then add fees to repair them.  Save your self the hassle and DO NOT USE this company to order anything!!</li>
    <li> I LIKE IT BUT, I HAVE USED IT NOW FOR 2+ YEARS AND I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO ORDER A NEW ONE EVERYTHING HAS FALLEN APART THE WHEELS KEEP FALLING OFF THE SCREWS KEEP FALLING OFF THE TIMER HAS QUIT AND THE ON OFF SWITCHES FOR STEAM &amp; OZONE HAVE FALLEN OFF! BUT IT STILL WORKS I HAVE JUST BECOME A MINI ELECTRICTION PUTTING IT BACK TOGETHER</li>
    <li> Magnifying glass came scratched. I reach out to seller 3 times and still have not heard back. Its extremely heaving and not easy to ship back. I have asked the seller to just ship the magnifying glass arm as everything else works fine. No response from seller. I would not suggest ordering this product as you might have the situation as me.</li>
    <li> Steaming smells funny, but it works perfect.. The lamp works perfect too but I&#x27;m not sure if I like how it&#x27;s so difficult to position it, I feel like its about to break everytime I move it around.  But other than that, I like it.. :)</li>
    <li> I purchased three of these and I&#x27;ve had them less than one year. All three steamers have stopped working and the light completely broke off of two of them within two months of use. DO NOT waste your money.</li>
    <li> I like the product and the cost. The steamer works great and the magnifying glass is very adjustable... Only one thing...the timer ticks too loud. I just wish maybe the timer could be a digital or being more quiet.</li>
    <li> i receive on time but the ligth bulb was broken, they have to be more carefully send item like this because is too expensive...[[ASIN:B005BFGYVI 2 IN 1 MAGNIFYING LAMP FACIAL STEAMER PRO Grade BEAUTY SALON SPA Equipment]]</li>
    <li> I received the product today (on time) but the light bulb was shattered. I called and the woman I spoke to was very calm and helpful (though the phone lines were a bit of a pain, they did not go straight to the automated system, just kept ringing I had to call many times to get through). Just an fyi there is a little circle in the middle of the mag. glass which was not described anywhere before purchase, I had never seen this before, I was told that it is for extra magnification. I have not set of the steamer yet, I plan on leaving it in the box until the new light bulb arrives.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with the high frequency galvanic roller beauty facial skin care for my mother in law&#x27;s spa salon and she loves it</li>
    <li> I figured it was time to write a review. Yes, it does tick tick tick as the timer counts down, but I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s annoying enough to deduct for. It works 100% and has worked well for me.</li>
    <li> This unit is just wobbly and awkward .  The steamer and light work great it just isn&#x27;t ideal for the treatment room so buying them separately is my suggestion .</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife so that she can use it on me at home.  The steam smell bad not sure why.  Is the smelling going to go away b/c I get dizzy smelling it?  Also, the light and the steamer get tangle up and little hard to move them around.</li>
    <li> Works better then I expected. Would buy again and would recommend it to a friend .I use it many times a day.</li>
    <li> Not very sturdy at all.</li>
    <li> Great product and easy to use n clean..It works well in my salon and its very manageable.My Facialist loves to use it</li>
    <li> Has a ticking timer and a bell!</li>
    <li> Very bad after I received the steamer didint work, so I have to send it back  I was disappointed  with this machine</li>
    <li> I almost didn&#x27;t order this. It had a lot of bad reviews. I&#x27;m not sure why. I think it&#x27;s absolutely great. Love it.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re not getting something worth less than $178. But you&#x27;re not getting more either. If you&#x27;re looking for the finest technology, then this  machine isn&#x27;t going to cut it. For me, it works, it fits, it was much cheaper than any other machine. It&#x27;s not the best quality, however it&#x27;s not falling apart. The instructions were minimal, but I managed to have it fully out of the box, put together, and box/packing discarded within 20 minutes.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied! I love the fact that you can raise or lower your steam to accommodate your client. The price was reasonable as well</li>
    <li> The light part was broken and it cut my hand when I was opening the package. I hope the company will ship a new product to me right away.</li>
    <li> IF YOU DO NOT WANT A LAWSUIT I SUGGEST YOU DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! I purchased the machine and the first day I received it... The machine burned my client In her face!!! I have contact the company and NO ONE WILL RESPOND... I&#x27;m seeking further actions of this lawsuit because the client received 2nd degree burn... NO ONE WANTS TO COMMUNICATE WITH ME SO SAVE YOURSELF THE HEADACHE THAT IM RECEIVING.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Product as described.</li>
    <li> When this arrived, It was a bit banged up. I decided to keep it due to the hassle of returning it. Well, that was a mistake! Only 4 uses and it broke!!!  I have a non profit and every dollar is needed, so now I am aware that they do not do free shipping for returns!!! This thing is huge and heavy and will cost me a lot to return.... Super sad about this company and product! I even called to talk within them about this and did not get the most friendly employee.</li>
    <li> ok product for the price</li>
    <li> I had the mag - light steamer combo for about 6 months and the power switch popped off, however, The customer service was just amazing. My husband called and they did absolutely everything they could do to keep us happy. We actually ended up upgrading to a better model and paying the difference. Very happy customer. Will buy from them again.</li>
    <li> Steamer didn&#x27;t even work upon arrival. Very unstable. I should&#x27;ve listen to the reviews. Please do not buy this.</li>
    <li> Great steamer. Nice and quiet, full steady stream of steam. Ozone is a beautiful blue. Timer does ding upon completion of timer.</li>
    <li> I bought this item several month ago to be able to perform 2 facial treatments at the same time at our spa. After it&lt;br /&gt;arrived with that broken water container we informed the company and never heard one word back. This item is not&lt;br /&gt;very expensive but than if you are not able to use it, yes, it becomes an expensive, space taking piece of s......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy it because if it is broken you will never get service on it and are stuck with a broken machine.</li>
    <li> Shipped with a missing water tank cap, not too big of a deal but steamer is less than a year old and the on/off button has broken rendering it useless.  Cheaply made item.....I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the second Multi Facial Steamer I bought from this company it works great, the price is very affordable and very easy to put together, it comes in a good double box package so nothing is damaged during shipping.</li>
    <li> I just got my shipment - there is no steamer - only the mag lamp. This is NOT the peice of equipment I ordered! I am so dissapointed and I sincerely hope that this is just a mistake....</li>
    <li> This steamer arrived in perfect condition. Packed very well. Everything seems to work correctly. Before I purchased, I read others reviews that this product wasn&#x27;t the best. I&#x27;ve been in the esthetics industry for 10 years. Steamers aren&#x27;t made to last. They are something you need to replace every so often. This one is no different.</li>
    <li> nice just as discribed</li>
    <li> The base is so poorly constructed it causes the steamer to be top heavy. After 10 months the base gave out. I decided to purchase a steamer that costs twice as much.....hopefully it will be constructed much better.</li>
    <li> Looks substantial, makes great steam and has a large,easy to use mag light. We have happily used it for one day.....</li>
    <li> So far so good. I just started using this machine a week ago but have had no problems with it.</li>
    <li> This manufacturer is impossible to find where to get parts or order a new glass container. I now have a useless unit because I cant find another glass container that broke when it first arrived. Please can someone help me find how and where to buy replacement parts or the 1800 number to the manufacturer. I googled it and found nothing as well as the manual it came with does not have a number, how weird... Any help is much appreciated.</li>
    <li> The unit is loud, ticks constantly. The ozone light is way too bright for your clients. The steamer runs out of water within 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;The unit is definitely not worth the money</li>
    <li> i have had 1 mag lamp and 1 steamer for 15 years. yes i do get attached to my tools, you think? its so white and new. Love the 5D. my cabana is much more spacious and not so cluttered looking.  1 tailor is much better than 2. what do you recommend for removing wax on the plastic areas?</li>
    <li> Steamer heats up quickly and works well. Good quality for the great price.  My only small complaint is that while I can rotate the steamer arm, I can&#x27;t adjust it&#x27;s height without unscrewing and adjusting the entire height of the machine. That&#x27;s different from others I&#x27;ve used. Otherwise, I love this machine :)</li>
    <li> Good product. Arrived safely. The description should mention that the timer clicks aloud while in use and dings at the end, which has been a neusanse to me during facials. Despite those things, it works wonderfully</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother who loves skin care &amp;#34;appliances&amp;#34; . She has had it for 2 years and absolutely adores this product !</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these steamers for my Spa. One broke in the first month . The switch went out and the second one stand won&#x27;t stay together. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase these for any high traffic spa or business. They are not made to last.</li>
    <li> Just received this steamer as a gift for my skin care studio and so far so good. It works as says. And is also very easy to put together as well.  Would purchase this again</li>
    <li> I want to send this back because I received it in really bad shape. The steamer looked as if it was used and not new.</li>
    <li> Product was shipped as expected; all parts were intact.  My only complaint with this product is that the whole thing feels flimsy.  The steamer arm is not adjustable by itself up and down (you can turn it left &amp; right) --you have to release the pole that it is inserted into up or down, which is a bit of a pain. Also the mag lamp arm part of it goes into the machine like a peg into a hole and is not secured.  So if you turn the lamp and the steamer arm to the same side, it seems top heavy on that side. I adjusted the arm of the lamp today and the whole arm came out and nearly fell onto my client.  But for $180 it does the job, and I&#x27;m just getting started in my business so I can manage with it for now.</li>
    <li> So it came just the lamp, not the ozone facial steamer...so I am very disappointed. The lamp itself is good...but not very good. Sorry.</li>
    <li> This machine is just perfect for my spa. I couldn&#x27;t get the lamp to work at first.  Finally, I found out where I could replace the fuse and that did the trick. My only request is that there would be more directions for the product.</li>
    <li> My daughter who is an Esthetician loves it.  It came originally from China with no breakage at all.  It is a very good machine and compact.  My daughter also told me that it is very easy to assemble.</li>
    <li> I received this steamer on time, with nothing broke.  The box looked a little rough so I was concerned but opened it and took out everything and it was all in tact.  The steamer works great and I really like the ozone, I&#x27;ve had comments on the blue light even!  I would recommend this steamer, for the price it&#x27;s great!!</li>
    <li> The lamp is not good quality and doesn&#x27;t hold on angle but steam works great but not the switch. Replacing the lamp with a LED light 5X and new switch bought from electric supply. Works well.</li>
    <li> This is a great product works very well. It also steams nice and consistent, the magnifier is a pleasant surprise also works well.</li>
    <li> Apply steam in just 5 minutes from the time you start heating the water.  Great value for the price!</li>
