    <li> Very Happy with my order.</li>
    <li> This soap is what I use everyday.  It is somewhat expensive, but it smells divine &amp; lasts a lot longer than Dove, or other grocery store soaps.</li>
    <li> Roger Gallet has always  been one of my favorites soaps.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this brand!</li>
    <li> Good, but never up to old time standards, when made? and packed by hand in the larger size.</li>
    <li> Arrived exactly as expected</li>
    <li> My mom loves these soaps and I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere.  Fast shipping and Mom is happy.</li>
    <li> Ben using it for years after finding it in Paris. Luv the smell.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite soap - expensive yes, but a delicious fragrance and long lasting.  A lovely treat for&lt;br /&gt;myself or my overnight guests.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to beat anything about these hard-milled soaps: size, fragrances, quality. Well, they could be a little bit cheaper.</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance, classic quality soap</li>
    <li> Started using this soap in Paris. Great soap; lasts a long time;  great fragrance that is not too strong , yet noticed.</li>
    <li> Can be used by women or men. Nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> Unless the bars of soap were radioactive, the amount of non-degradable packaging used was unconscionable.  Obviously this shipper has no sense of environmental responsibility.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend, and she was delighted with the scent and texture. Probably will buy some again for gifts.</li>
    <li> I  first  discovered  this  soap  when  I  was  in  Paris  and  it  was  so  memorable  that  I  had to  get  some  for  home.  The smell  is  heavenly  and  lingers so  that  it  permeates  the  bathroom  and  my  adjoining  bedroom .</li>
    <li> This soap has a beautiful spicy fragrance. Though expensive it lasts much longer than most soaps of similar quality. Try it!</li>
    <li> I am very allergic to most perfumes. It took me 20 yrs to find the Extra Vieille scent. Since R &amp; G was taken over several years ago, the scent only seems to last for about 1/2 of the usage of the soap. I will continue to use this product, because it&#x27;s the only one my allergy will tolerate.</li>
    <li> Love this soap for its soothing feel and wonderful fragrance. It&#x27;s very good for dry skin but not oily at all. Advised for dry winter skin.</li>
    <li> I had not used Roger &amp;  Gallet in years.  I vacationed in Paris this year and saw it in a store.  I decided to come home and purchase from Amazon rather than purchasing in Paris and having to pack it in a suitcase.</li>
    <li> Really nice fragrance, doesn&#x27;t smell cheap.  Great for putting in your clothes drawers as a sachet, besides using on your body in the bath.</li>
    <li> I used the carnation fragrance for 40 yrs...so sad that is has been discontinued (I have 1 box left).  I am searching for a new favorite and I am starting with this one.  This is the BEST soap I have ever used...</li>
    <li> All went well with the order, arrived fast, great product.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, love the item, product was handled with care and packaging was really good. Will most likely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Wanted the soap at Sofitel Europe hotels and this is it! Smell much stronger than hotel bars but stashed one in my drawer and seems to be getting gentler</li>
    <li> I love these soaps and keep extras in the house at all times.  They are special and remind me so much of my childhood and all the traveling we did around Europe. The scent is suitable for men and women and are the perfect addition to any bathroom.  Forget about antibacterial except for appropriate times and replace all your ugly pumps with these beautiful, milled soaps.</li>
    <li> The perfume in this soap reminds me of 4711, the unisex cologne which used to be &amp;#34;sophisticated&amp;#34; when I was a child. I don&#x27;t use it anymore but I&#x27;ve always liked this aroma!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy this brand for my two round soap holders and it is the best option I&#x27;ve found. The soap is a pleasure to use with a nice foam. The cakes are thick and substantial and last a long time.</li>
    <li> Had average reaction to this product . Nice enough but  would not reorder.</li>
    <li> Excellent soap! A classic scent and goes with all activities, day or evening. I have used it for years.</li>
    <li> The only soap that both my husband and I really like, so we don&#x27;t need &amp;#34;his and her&amp;#34; soaps on the bathroom shelf, but just the one.  I love the scent, and the creamy quality  of the soap.  Worth the price.</li>
