    <li> If you are looking for a good quality and affordable flat iron than this one is for you. Karmin provides salon quality at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. My hair never gets caught up in it like it does in some other brads. Use it everyday!!</li>
    <li> Great straightener, and great customer service. My first iron began sparking and they replaced it very quickly, and even sent me a newer model! Love the pink color too! Best straightener I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve been through a few.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t think it would be that good, but you really pay what you get for. The price is not that cheap, but worth .</li>
    <li> I bought this after my  Chi iron broke. I had never used another brand, so I was hesitant to switch. I figured I could return it if I didn&#x27;t like it. At first, I was unsure - the tool felt lighter than my Chi and I thought it would lack the weight/grip to be effective. I&#x27;ve had the Karmin iron for several months now and I&#x27;m very happy with it. The iron gets hot very quickly - and stays hot. As long as you follow the instructions (move slowly, use smaller hair pieces), the results will be great. I&#x27;ve also used it to add curls, which works well, too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a professional product: I have used it and i can recommend this straightener to people with curly hair: It&#x27;s beautiful</li>
    <li> I got this straightener Summer 2012 and it is still going strong! It heats up quickly and straightens my very curly hair really well. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this straightener! I have very course, wavy, thick hair, and most straighteners take multiple passes to straighten my hair, but this one does it on the first pass. I also love that is automatically turns off if you forget to turn it off. Also many straighteners damage my hair, but this one has never pulled or damaged my hair.</li>
    <li> This straightener is nice and does the job, but I&#x27;ve used better ones and probably wouldn&#x27;t have spent this much money had I known I wouldn&#x27;t get the results I wanted. It straightens my hair okay, but it still pulls my hair like my old straightener used to, and isn&#x27;t as hot as I&#x27;d like it to be.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this product as it performs well. They also stand behind their product when there are issues.</li>
    <li> I have very long and thick hair and this straightener actually gets my hair straight! I absolutely love it and was a great investment. I thought I would never find a straightener that would straighten my hair and leave it looking healthy. Amazing product!</li>
    <li> I got this in pink and I love the color. So not only it looked pretty but it worked good too. I already had a straightner but I needed to get one that can glide better and I can create curls easier. This did the job! I liked how that the plates are black so that the products you put on your hair prior using the straigthener doesn&#x27;t show too much on the straigthner (my previous straightener had light color plates and I have to wipe it down every time I finished using it.)&lt;br /&gt;I also liked how it came with a bag and a cooling pad, very thoughtful.</li>
    <li> This straightener is just average. I wish I would have purchased a crock but chose the Kar min due to the warranty.  I ordered a black straightener and was thoroughly disappointed when a Barbie doll pink straightener arrived. Ugggggh!!!!! The shipping was very quick.</li>
    <li> Got this straightener for my girlfriend last Christmas. She absolutely loves it. We are now married. Thank you karmin..... thank you.</li>
    <li> I love the straightener.  My hair is thick and coarse and the Karmin works perfectly on it without much effort.  The result is shiny hair, either as straight as I want, or with some wave at times, depending on my mood for the day.</li>
    <li> It works very well!! I love how it leaves my hair so shiny and silky looking, I would recomend this product</li>
    <li> I really liked this product, it makes my hair shine and it doesnt damage it. I advise you to try it&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend it,</li>
    <li> I love my karmin straighten I have been using it for about a year now and it still works great.  I have pretty coarse hair and when I straighten my hair it lasts for the entire day. Worth the cost!</li>
    <li> Great straightener that works quickly on my thick hair. Doesn&#x27;t seem to damage my hair as much as previous straighteners have.</li>
    <li> Really awesome price on a flat iron. It heats up FAST and my hair doesn&#x27;t get caught on it at all like my old straightener.</li>
    <li> Straightens like a charm on Dry hair. Can only do small chunks of hair at a time. I have thick wavy hair?</li>
