      <li>This is an excellent product.  </li>
      <li>a great seller!</li>
      <li>It stays charged about 2 wks and works great.</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>I am happy with it.    </li>
      <li>[...]  This is an excellent shaver with an excellent price, much cheaper than in the stores.</li>
      <li>The one I had to replace was very good, but this one is even better.    </li>
      <li>I would have rated it 5 stars, but it is fairly noisy.    </li>
      <li>The charger even seems like a good quality one.  </li>
      <li>Good shaver</li>
      <li>For now, I am a happy camper, pleased with Remington.</li>
      <li>Comes with some attachments as well, I am very satisfied.</li>
      <li>:  This razor gives a great shave -  close and smooth.  </li>
      <li>It is still a good buy and maybe yours will have a better battery life?</li>
      <li>However at $30 it is pretty good!</li>
      <li>The pop-up trimmer works great, but it could 1/16th of an inch higher.</li>
      <li>This razor gives a very smooth shave.</li>
      <li>The razor has nice grips and is easy to handle and is well-balanced.</li>
      <li>But I would recommend spending a bit more and getting the Braun which is much better and smoother.</li>
      <li>and I find it much better than the Remington.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had Remington shavers for many years.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes even more.   </li>
      <li>You pay more</li>
      <li>I will buy more</li>
      <li>I gave it a 3 because it did the job for me for many years.</li>
      <li>For some reason, I always seemed to get better shaves with the 2-head Remington than with a 3-head.  </li>
      <li>it shaves faster and better than any electric razor I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
      <li>I am definatly glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>The replacement is much better for battery life.  </li>
      <li>2- The top compartment does not mount well and sometimes pops off.   </li>
      <li>It is very easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this shaver for 3 years now, and i&#x27;m finely getting around to replacing the blades.  </li>
      <li>This shaver is also dual-voltage, which is great because my work occasionally takes me overseas.</li>
      <li>The MS-2 is fantastic.</li>
      <li>3- Fairly comfortable    </li>
      <li>I chose Remington for my first one, and I am still choosing the latest style.</li>
      <li>This new shaver gives a great shave, as good as my last shaver, but the battery will not hold a charge for more than one shave, which means that I must plug it in every night in order to shave the next day.  </li>
      <li>And when I finally did replace the microscreen and the heads, the shave is not as good.</li>
      <li>Lucky to get 3 or 4 shaves from one charge.</li>
      <li>It gives me a close shave (not as close as my shave cream and blade shaves) and is quick.</li>
      <li>It leaves a smooth shave with no uncomfortable nicks or cuts.  </li>
      <li>There is a green light that will tell you when the shaver is done charging, which it does very quickly (surprisingly so).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the razor for 4 months, and overall, this is a nice razor.  </li>
      <li>I decided to write a review even though its too early because, before purchasing I looked for reviews and did not find many.</li>
      <li>This is a powerful razor that I would recommend to anyone.</li>
      <li>In this case, I got my money&#x27;s worth, still using it</li>
      <li>not only was the product good quality, as i expected, but the service and time in transit was outstanding.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this electric razor for the past 2 years and it has done a great job.  </li>
      <li>Much more power than any other shaver, easy to use</li>
      <li>I have a Remington MS2-290 that I have had for several years that I liked so much</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and this shaver works well for me and Stan&#x27;s up good to daily use.</li>
      <li>This one shaves pretty well, but it is not the closest shave you can get with an electric.  </li>
      <li>And, Yes I did fully charge it per directions before the first use.....</li>
      <li>It is easy to clean and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>Surely the battery should last longer than this.</li>
      <li>A single charge lasts the better part of a week.</li>
      <li>In that amount of time, I can&#x27;t really accomplish much.  </li>
      <li>why, but you can tell when the charge is getting low because the sound changes on the shaver.    </li>
      <li>Now he has to plug it in immediately before he wants to use it.  </li>
      <li>This shaver works very well.</li>
      <li>It shaves very well but plan on returning it not knowing how reliable the battery will be.</li>
      <li>Previous Remingtons were much better quality.</li>
      <li>(it does a decent job)</li>
      <li>A complete charge - which took a full day, followed by using it until it completely discharged, and then another complete recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After decades of using Norelcos, I highly recommend this model Remington.</li>
      <li>It has always had to be recharged after about 10 minutes of use since it was brand new.</li>
      <li>1- Very loud.</li>
      <li>However, from the first time I used this razor, the charge only lasts about 20-30 seconds.  </li>
      <li>This is the first electric razon I have had that actually works .</li>
      <li>I previously had a similar model but the battery life was much better than this one.</li>
      <li>I am happy with the shaving quality of the unit, I have a medium tough beard, need to shave in the morning and if going out, later that evening, do a second shave.  </li>
      <li>This is replacing my 8 year old remington microscreen.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this shaver as a replacement for my husband&#x27;s 20 year old Remington that had worn out.  </li>
      <li>It vibrates and makes loud noise.   </li>
      <li>It takes between 18 and 22 hours to completely recharge.  </li>
      <li>With my old one I shave over a week before it needs to recharge.</li>
      <li>This shaver gives me a close enough shave that I really don&#x27;t need to use the blade to have a better-than-passable shave.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve owned several different electric shavers over time and this one does pretty poorly if I try and use it once a day, but if I shaved in the evening as well as my usual morning ritual, it does great!  </li>
      <li>Maybe with Remington newer doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean better.</li>
      <li>My old remington is 40 years old and other than new heads, has never failed me....</li>
      <li>It is a bit tricky changing out the foils, you need to be mechanically inclined with fine dexterity to push out the rubber groumets or bumpers, not sure what to call them, then the foils pull through.</li>
      <li>For me no other shaver comes close.</li>
      <li>Its use is generally reserved to vacations, weekends away from home or when I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
      <li>There is a red light on the thing that is pointless.  </li>
      <li>Although it&#x27;s only a two screen head (vs my old 3 head Remington model)</li>
      <li>my old Remington recharageable razor would only run for 5-6 shaves before recharge.</li>
      <li>I have only had this unit for about 3 days, so far I like it.</li>
      <li>Typically the power supply on inexpensive chargers get hot.  </li>
      <li>This one barely gets above room temperature, if even that.      </li>

    <li> The first one got sent back for poor battery life.  The replacement is much better for battery life.  This is replacing my 8 year old remington microscreen.  This one shaves pretty well, but it is not the closest shave you can get with an electric.  However at $30 it is pretty good!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several different electric shavers over time and this one does pretty poorly if I try and use it once a day, but if I shaved in the evening as well as my usual morning ritual, it does great!  That does make it a minor inconvenience to use, but overall the time I use to shave (once taking into account the time to slather on the shaving cream before and aftershave afterwards) is less than before.  I personally haven&#x27;t had any issues with the battery life that others mentioned.</li>
    <li> I have had low vision for a few years and I had to change to an electric shaver. I chose Remington for my first one, and I am still choosing the latest style. It gives a clean,smooth shave. It is easy to clean and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  For some reason, I always seemed to get better shaves with the 2-head Remington than with a 3-head.  This shaver is also dual-voltage, which is great because my work occasionally takes me overseas.</li>
    <li> I have a Remington MS2-290 that I have had for several years that I liked so much I wanted another one at a second location. For the one I received the battery only holds a charge for three shaves, and at that point the charge drops to 0 in an instant, and the trimmer needs assistance to deploy. With my old one I shave over a week before it needs to recharge. It shaves very well but plan on returning it not knowing how reliable the battery will be.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with Remington razors for about 10 years now. I&#x27;ve had the MS-290 about 3 years. I recently changed to a Braun 340 and I find it much better than the Remington. I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t make the change earlier. Here are the pros and cons:     Pros:   1- Close shave  2- Gets almost all of the hairs with the exception of few here and there and on the neck.   3- Fairly comfortable    Cons:   1- Very loud. It vibrates and makes loud noise.   2- The top compartment does not mount well and sometimes pops off.   3- Does not support cord shaving. Only cordless.  4- After the first 2 years, battery starts getting pregressively bad so one has to change shaver not because it doesn&#x27;t work but because battery won&#x27;t hold a charge.   5- long charge time. 15 min charge time for a shave  6- Have to move shaver over face over 5 times to shave all hairs. Sometimes even more.   7- No spring flexed cutting head. As a result shaving is somewhat rough.     I gave it a 3 because it did the job for me for many years. But I would recommend spending a bit more and getting the Braun which is much better and smoother.</li>
    <li> This product was described as \\&quot;worldwide voltage\\&quot;. On looking at the charging lead it said 120V AC. I e-mailed Amazon and my enquiry was forwarded to the supplier who told me to return the shaver and eventually I received a refund less postage.</li>
    <li> Have owned this model electric shaver for over  4 years ( it has been a long time, forgot when I got it ) ..have replaced the foils at least every year because they have worn through. Gone through about 4 to 5 foil kits. I replace them , when it starts nicking me, then I look for that hole in the foils. Have not noticed any problem with battery holding a charge, have gone a couple of days in our motor home without electricity, and shaved. It is a bit tricky changing out the foils, you need to be mechanically inclined with fine dexterity to push out the rubber groumets or bumpers, not sure what to call them, then the foils pull through. I have worn out the rubber protector over the \\&quot;on\\&quot; and \\&quot;off\\&quot; switch, have been using it this way for over one year. So I guess my only complaint right now, is that that rubber protector over the switch will eventually wear through after 4 years and expose the white plastic switch. I recommend getting a spare foil kit, in anticipation of replacing them, so you will not be without a replacement foil for several days.    I am happy with the shaving quality of the unit, I have a medium tough beard, need to shave in the morning and if going out, later that evening, do a second shave.  In this case, I got my money&#x27;s worth, still using it</li>
    <li> Although it&#x27;s only a two screen head (vs my old 3 head Remington model) it shaves faster and better than any electric razor I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  When I received my Remington electric razor I charged it for the required 24 hours.  Since this initial charge, over 3 weeks ago, I haven&#x27;t had to recharge, and that&#x27;s using the razor 6-7 days a weeks!  Unbelieveable battery capacity!  Note: my old Remington recharageable razor would only run for 5-6 shaves before recharge.</li>
    <li> Good shaver but let down by poor battery life. Lucky to get 3 or 4 shaves from one charge. Surely the battery should last longer than this. I previously had a similar model but the battery life was much better than this one. Maybe with Remington newer doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for 3 years now, and i&#x27;m finely getting around to replacing the blades.  The shaver works just as it&#x27;s supposed to day after day.  The battery lasts about two weeks.  There is a green light that will tell you when the shaver is done charging, which it does very quickly (surprisingly so).  The charger even seems like a good quality one.  Typically the power supply on inexpensive chargers get hot.  This is due to poor quality, and just wastes electricity.  This one barely gets above room temperature, if even that.      There is a red light on the thing that is pointless.  I thought it was supposed to show you low charge, which it doesn&#x27;t.  It lights up when you&#x27;re USING the product.  I have no idea why, but you can tell when the charge is getting low because the sound changes on the shaver.    I would have rated it 5 stars, but it is fairly noisy.    It shaves close, and I haven&#x27;t had a single problem with it.  My over-all cost so far has been significantly less than buying blades.</li>
    <li> My Braun recently died on me after serving me well for a number of years.  My wife went out and bought the Remington and while I have no qualms about the shave itself (it does a decent job) the battery life is downright horrible.  Does not hold a charge for very long and the most disappointing thing is that there is no visual indicator that it is low on charge nor can you shave while it is plugged in!  Going back to Braun.  You pay more but I find you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This razor gives a very smooth shave. But after using it for about 8 months I decided to replace the heads and screen. Not easy. Getting the microscreen out of the holder is next to impossible. And when I finally did replace the microscreen and the heads, the shave is not as good.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shaver as a replacement for my husband&#x27;s 20 year old Remington that had worn out.  Unfortunately, I returned it today because the shaver would not hold a charge.  I am hoping for a refund.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I have had Remington&#x27;s in the past, inexpensive and reliable.  However, from the first time I used this razor, the charge only lasts about 20-30 seconds.  In that amount of time, I can&#x27;t really accomplish much.  This purchase was a complete waste of money and now I am stuck using the old razor I was attempting to replace.  Now I am faced with starting from scratch.  BUYERS REMORSE!</li>
    <li> shaver had broken trimmer on receipt  returned to discount jungle on may 3,2010   still no credit received unit returned vis ups tracking #  1zf485700342778433 very poor supplier         Paul T Cheponis</li>
    <li> This is the first electric razon I have had that actually works . It is not perfect but it gets me by. I am definatly glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Remington shavers for many years.  This was a replacement for one that lasted 10 years, before it became difficult to find replacement foil/cutter.  This new shaver gives a great shave, as good as my last shaver, but the battery will not hold a charge for more than one shave, which means that I must plug it in every night in order to shave the next day.  If I forget - no shave that day. I didn&#x27;t think this would be that bad, so I didn&#x27;t return the shaver (which is a pain), but this defect has proven to be a major annoyance.  I am very disappointed in this product, not what I have come to expect from Remington. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> The MS-2 is fantastic. I am on my fourth... I&#x27;ve been using them for over 20 years. Much more power than any other shaver, easy to use and i travel around the world with it. The reason I&#x27;m on my fourth is that the internal battery eventually wears out. Thats it. For me no other shaver comes close.</li>
    <li> [...]  This is an excellent shaver with an excellent price, much cheaper than in the stores. Comes with some attachments as well, I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> not only was the product good quality, as i expected, but the service and time in transit was outstanding. a great seller!</li>
    <li> This is a powerful razor that I would recommend to anyone. It stays charged about 2 wks and works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this electric razor for the past 2 years and it has done a great job.  It leaves a smooth shave with no uncomfortable nicks or cuts.  The battery life allows for 1-3 shaves on each charge.</li>
    <li> This shaver works very well. The only complaint I have had with it is the run time. It has always had to be recharged after about 10 minutes of use since it was brand new. I have owned several other Remington shavers in the past and the battery life was MUCH LONGER than this one. But, Who knows, maybe I just got a bad battery? It is still a good buy and maybe yours will have a better battery life? And, Yes I did fully charge it per directions before the first use.....I have owned this product for 1 year.</li>
    <li> I have only had this unit for about 3 days, so far I like it. The shave is closer and smoother than I used to get using regular razor[Gillette Sensor Excel]. I am happy with it.    I decided to write a review even though its too early because, before purchasing I looked for reviews and did not find many. Hopefully my review will help others in their decission making.    I will write another review at the end of 30days.     For now, I am a happy camper, pleased with Remington. Will continue to use it. I even used the pop-up trimmer on side bruns it works well.</li>
    <li> I thought I was buying a duplicate of the shaver that was stolen from my motel room when I was on a business trip.  The one I had to replace was very good, but this one is even better.    I have a very tough beard (I typically use the electric shaver before taking a shower, then a traditional hot lather-and-blade shave afterwards).  This shaver gives me a close enough shave that I really don&#x27;t need to use the blade to have a better-than-passable shave.  In addition, the charge seems to last forever.    After decades of using Norelcos, I highly recommend this model Remington.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the razor for 4 months, and overall, this is a nice razor.  However, its battery/electrical features are poorly designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:  This razor gives a great shave -  close and smooth.  Never a nick and never a pulled hair. The razor has nice grips and is easy to handle and is well-balanced. It is very easy to clean.  I get 8-9 days of shaves out of it. I think the battery lasts a bit longer than the 60 minutes advertised.  However, I also followed the instructions in \\&quot;conditioning\\&quot; the battery before using the razor.  A complete charge - which took a full day, followed by using it until it completely discharged, and then another complete recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:  No battery life indicator or low battery warning.  And even worse, it won&#x27;t run on the electrical cord.  So if the battery dies and you haven&#x27;t finished your shave, you are out of luck.  Plugging it in doesn&#x27;t make the shaver run.  Also, it has a ridiculously long recharge cycle.  It takes between 18 and 22 hours to completely recharge.  Who designed this?  The pop-up trimmer works great, but it could 1/16th of an inch higher.</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my husbanfd who had it for about 2 months before it refused to hold a charge.  Now he has to plug it in immediately before he wants to use it.  Previous Remingtons were much better quality.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this razor ever day. Its use is generally reserved to vacations, weekends away from home or when I&#x27;m in a hurry. I like the product a lot. It gives me a close shave (not as close as my shave cream and blade shaves) and is quick. A single charge lasts the better part of a week. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is if the battery is dead I cannot plug it in and use it immediately. I have to do at least a partial charge before I can finish my shave. Were it not for this I would rate it 5 star.....My old remington is 40 years old and other than new heads, has never failed me....</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this shaver works well for me and Stan&#x27;s up good to daily use. No problems.</li>
    <li> Works great. I will buy more</li>
