      <li>I&#x27;m very happy and satisfied with this cream and it cost me less than $4</li>
      <li>Just be sure not to use all over your skin because it seems pretty potent.</li>
      <li>It does work, I am light brown skinned</li>
      <li>I wanted to lighten, and both were much lighted in a matter of days!!!</li>
      <li>For now it&#x27;s working fine on me in my first week of used.</li>
      <li>You must be very consistent with this product to see results</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to put it on right now.</li>
      <li>It really works!</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>and It does exactly what the description says.</li>
      <li>It works pretty well.</li>
      <li>I cant really give a review on something I didn&#x27;t use ....its too oily for my liking.</li>
      <li>and it gives my skin tone a much brighter look.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very moisturizing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
      <li>I really need something for the darkness around my daughters arms and neck .</li>
      <li>Very dissatisfied</li>
      <li>This really works.</li>
      <li>and my elbows has lightened up so much.</li>
      <li>BUT the spot I used it on came back darker than it originally was after I stopped using it for a month.</li>
      <li>Working well so far, delivery was also very fast</li>
      <li>Works faster on newer scars or still in the process of healing wounds than on older scars.</li>
      <li>Its an older formula that works  </li>
      <li>Not for whitening skin, it mainly just to take of acne scars and sun spots</li>
      <li>Be cautious of where you apply it on your face; if youre not careful youll end up like me - super white cheeks!</li>
      <li>would not advise a dark skinned person to purchase this product it works on light skin.</li>
      <li>I was surprised that this product works!</li>
      <li>i wouldn&#x27;t overuse as there is only so much information out on bleach with the FDA from what I understand.</li>
      <li>but I have been too busy.</li>
      <li>I use soft soap and a wash cloth once a day.</li>
      <li>It works very well as long as your consistant.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used it three times, and can clearly see a clearing of my freckled complexion.</li>
      <li>But be careful because it WILL lighten your skin fast and noticeably.</li>
      <li>As a mid-thirties woman living near the beach, I have a lot of sun damage, especially on my chest.</li>
      <li>All I wanted was a tiny skin discoloration to fade away slightly, not even expecting it to disappear.  </li>

<li> Since I was young I always have dark elbows</li>
<li> I use it now at night when I spend a long time in the sun to avoid my face and body from being two seperate colors.</li>
<li> Complete waste of money.  </li>
<li> I mean this cram is kind of weak, works but takes too long!!!!</li>
<li> I have dark skin above my lip and age spots</li>
<li> I am glad it wasn&#x27;t very expensive.</li>
<li> If I start getting &amp;#34;bumpy&amp;#34; I use witch hazel mixed with a little rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball all over.</li>
<li> It is working like I expected to according to the reviews I read before I purchased.  </li>
<li> But honestly if I were to recommend a creme it would be piona, it&#x27;s a lotion base and works well with all completions.</li>
<li> I usually buy this product from Wal Mart because it is actually cheaper</li>
<li> There is a reason it&#x27;s banned in other countries.</li>
<li> This substance does the work as whiter in hard solid material.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m dark brown and used this for acne scars.</li>
<li> I started using this product when i was a child for the dark spots, ie elbows and knees.</li>
<li> I still would not recommend it to Dark skinnned people.  </li>
<li> i&#x27;m black and noticed no difference.</li>
<li> I had a problem with picking at a black head on my nose &amp; it started to scar &amp; during the healing process</li>
<li> The rings around the neck will be much less noticeable after using this for a few days.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t notice any marks gone just my complexion a little softer.</li>
<li> It did barley a little fading</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
<li> but you have to apply this product everyday to get maximum results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> After four weeks, the dark pigmentation on my chest has faded to the point where it is hardly noticeable.</li>
<li> I bought this to fade a rather large birthmark that I&#x27;ve always hated.</li>
<li> this works but very slowly.</li>
<li> The delivery was fast, but the creme itself was a waxy feel to it leaving my skin horribly oily.</li>
<li> In one week, my face was in bad shape.</li>
<li> just oily skin :-(</li>
<li> I hated it</li>
<li> omg, This is the worst cream ever.i have never had acne or pimples before.</li>
<li> but like I said I can&#x27;t give a horrible review on something I haven&#x27;t used</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to work. I wish it did . I really need something for the darkness around my daughters arms and neck . Very dissatisfied</li>
    <li> It is working like I expected to according to the reviews I read before I purchased.  I am glad it wasn&#x27;t very expensive.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!!! I noticed visible lightning within 3 days! I have dark skin above my lip and age spots I wanted to lighten, and both were much lighted in a matter of days!!! Very happy!!!</li>
    <li> this product is amazing !! i had acne scars alllll over my face after using it for just one month my scars are 90% erased !!!</li>
    <li> It did work to get rid of my melasma and hyper pigmentation with about a week or two BUT the spot I used it on came back darker than it originally was after I stopped using it for a month. DON&#x27;T trust hydroquinone. There is a reason it&#x27;s banned in other countries.</li>
    <li> And it works. I still have to keep using it but taking away the blotchy patches on my neck and upper chest. My face looks good but as they say...it&#x27;s all about the neck. The rings around the neck will be much less noticeable after using this for a few days. I&#x27;m going to put it on right now. Works well. REMEMBER to wipe it off the eyebrows so you don&#x27;t bleach them. i wouldn&#x27;t overuse as there is only so much information out on bleach with the FDA from what I understand.</li>
    <li> omg, This is the worst cream ever.i have never had acne or pimples before. In one week, my face was in bad shape. I had to trash this cream</li>
    <li> Great product. Not for whitening skin, it mainly just to take of acne scars and sun spots</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this product. As a mid-thirties woman living near the beach, I have a lot of sun damage, especially on my chest. I&#x27;ve only used it three times, and can clearly see a clearing of my freckled complexion. The oiliness is no problem if you are diligent about cleaning your face. I use soft soap and a wash cloth once a day. If I start getting &amp;#34;bumpy&amp;#34; I use witch hazel mixed with a little rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball all over. It works great!</li>
    <li> Yes. It is not from the bottle picture with cream. This substance does the work as whiter in hard solid material.</li>
    <li> Very great product, They have the same product at Walgreens or Walmart for only $3.00.  It does work, I am light brown skinned and it gives my skin tone a much brighter look.  It does lighten your skin but you have to apply this product everyday to get maximum results.&lt;br /&gt;I would not advise a dark skinned person to purchase this product it works on light skin. I have tried the Nadinola which has 3% Hydroquinone and I still ended up going back to this product.  Its an older formula that works  and thats been around for years. I still would not recommend it to Dark skinnned people.  It has bleached my skin I am already light skinned and it looks healthy.  I LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> The delivery was fast, but the creme itself was a waxy feel to it leaving my skin horribly oily. It did barley a little fading I didn&#x27;t notice any marks gone just my complexion a little softer. But honestly if I were to recommend a creme it would be piona, it&#x27;s a lotion base and works well with all completions.</li>
    <li> been using this every night. No results</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t work at all!!!!</li>
    <li> this works but very slowly. Works faster on newer scars or still in the process of healing wounds than on older scars. I had a problem with picking at a black head on my nose &amp; it started to scar &amp; during the healing process I kept putting this on the skin &amp; it healed with no discoloration &amp; no issues. Another scar on my thigh that I&#x27;ve had for 5 years started to lighten up &amp; get smaller. You must be very consistent with this product to see results</li>
    <li> I usually buy this product from Wal Mart because it is actually cheaper but I have been too busy. So I ordered it. I love this product and have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> This cream didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
    <li> no change in skin tone</li>
    <li> I am still qaiting for the result.</li>
    <li> It really works! I use to put it on 3 times a day because of my acne scars, but I only need to use it about once of twice a day now. Be cautious of where you apply it on your face; if youre not careful youll end up like me - super white cheeks! It&#x27;s also very moisturizing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Its cheaper at Walmart, I get it there for $2.00.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me on knees which is what I bought it for.</li>
    <li> I was surprised that this product works! I have acne scars all over my face, and so I&#x27;ve been using this product every night. I&#x27;ve seen improvements and my acne spots have faded/ have become lighter.</li>
    <li> The product didn&#x27;t meet my needs..still have a lot of spots..have to use makeup to cover it up...after weeks of using this product..</li>
    <li> Noticeable changes, nothing drastic but within two weeks I&#x27;ve gotten about a shade lighter and my skin is a lot clearer.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> This product works perfectly for me. It makes my skin oily so i wouldnt recommended to use it during day time. It is better to apply before you go to bed and you can see your skin tone changing within no time.</li>
    <li> Working well so far, delivery was also very fast</li>
    <li> Within a couple of months, scars will fade away</li>
    <li> This really works. I&#x27;m dark brown and used this for acne scars. Your skin will definitely become brighter and smoother/glowy. But be careful because it WILL lighten your skin fast and noticeably. Unless you&#x27;re intentionally trying to lighten your skin..</li>
    <li> Complete waste of money.  Did nothing for me.  All I wanted was a tiny skin discoloration to fade away slightly, not even expecting it to disappear.  This did not do it for me even when I was religiously applying it morning and night.</li>
    <li> I bought this to fade a rather large birthmark that I&#x27;ve always hated. It works pretty well. Just be sure not to use all over your skin because it seems pretty potent.</li>
    <li> After four weeks, the dark pigmentation on my chest has faded to the point where it is hardly noticeable.</li>
    <li> not a difference have used it all applied twice per day for 2 months. i&#x27;m black and noticed no difference. just oily skin :-(</li>
    <li> I cant really give a review on something I didn&#x27;t use ....its too oily for my liking. I used it once and its been sitting on my counter ever since ....but like I said I can&#x27;t give a horrible review on something I haven&#x27;t used</li>
    <li> Great price fast shipping. Thank you</li>
    <li> Great so exited just came in on time I&#x27;ll give another rating based on the results</li>
    <li> I started using this product when i was a child for the dark spots, ie elbows and knees. I use it now at night when I spend a long time in the sun to avoid my face and body from being two seperate colors. It works very well as long as your consistant.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me, maybe it will work for another person.</li>
    <li> I thought it was in a bottle as shown</li>
    <li> This cram works only if you combine with stronger cram. I mean this cram is kind of weak, works but takes too long!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this cream 4 weeks ago and I am amazed how well it worked . Since I was young I always have dark elbows I hated it and I was embarrassed . Ive been using this cream for 4 wks  now and my elbows has lightened up so much. I&#x27;m very happy and satisfied with this cream and it cost me less than $4</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! and It does exactly what the description says. For now it&#x27;s working fine on me in my first week of used.</li>
    <li> I am using this on a scar- Working good</li>
