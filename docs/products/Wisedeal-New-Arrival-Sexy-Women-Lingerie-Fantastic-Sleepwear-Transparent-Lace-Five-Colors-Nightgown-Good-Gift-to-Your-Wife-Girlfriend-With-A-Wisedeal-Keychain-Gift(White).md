      <li>And the wife said she loved it to.</li>
      <li>and this fit perfectly.</li>
      <li>I think it looks good, my wife hates it.</li>
      <li>I give a great rating cuz my wife is sexy as hell...</li>
      <li>it is cute, but the fabric there is not so great.  </li>
      <li>sexy, good quality for price</li>
      <li>A real shame because its perfect and we both love it.</li>
      <li>Most would say petite...</li>
      <li>Thank you :)</li>
      <li>Really sexy to wear on.</li>
      <li>Why do I try these cheap companies,  aaah !</li>
      <li>This one looks way better up close.</li>
      <li>Looks great on my wife, she loved it, good fit, would recommend it to any hot blooded male as essential purchase.</li>
      <li>It fit like it was made for a child.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t fit into the item.</li>
      <li>So soft and its nicely made.</li>
      <li>Cute lil white lingerie.  </li>
      <li>Note that it really is for Asians though.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping</li>
      <li>really set,s it off.</li>
      <li>The fabric barely has any give (which is normally not a bad thing for lace)</li>
      <li>First off, shipping time is like a month: they let you know this when you order it, but still a bit far.  </li>
      <li>The small / medium might fit my 10 year old grand daughter but not for 10yr old.</li>
      <li>Includes a little see through matching panties with it, really cute.</li>
      <li>This was pretty, only to sit in my drawer.</li>
      <li>Now, as to the garment; the lace quality is fair, but the stitching in some areas (particularly the knots that open the neck) is not great.  </li>
      <li>Not all that clear on the sizing.</li>
      <li>Also, it is pretty short: my girlfriend is 4&#x27;11&amp;#34; and the bottom barely reaches her crotch.  </li>
      <li>Overall a decent item, especially for the price I paid, but certainly nothing I would buy again.</li>
      <li>In the neck area there are three knot and loops that must be opened to loosen the neck enough to put it on; the first one came off okay, but the second two knots are about two - three times the size of the loops, making it impossible without taking the loops apart and re-doing them.  </li>
      <li>Was shipped quickly, but the size runs very small.</li>
      <li>Materials are scratchy, they are tiny small,  and if you decide to buy a larger size the fit is not right.</li>

<li> Was shipped quickly, but the size runs very small.</li>
<li> Materials are scratchy, they are tiny small,  and if you decide to buy a larger size the fit is not right.</li>
<li> /&gt;However this biggest concern is mainly that the material does not seem to be of any quality that will last even a few washes...</li>
<li> It was too small for me for a large</li>
<li> Now, for the real point killer: this thing is small.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t imagine they will last too long, even hand-washing.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately I dont think this would fit anyone bigger.</li>
<li> worry how long it will handle wear and tear in the long run</li>
<li> Cute but small and the little buttons are hard to do alone</li>
<li> This wasn&#x27;t even long enough to cover my bottom half.</li>
<li> so I can imagine that anyone above size 2 would not fit this at all</li>
<li> My wife is smaller than average and is not comfortable in this at all.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s bad when I started crying when I put it in and couldn&#x27;t fit it.</li>
<li> but it looked ridiculous and started to frey after only one hour of wear.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s a bit tight.</li>
<li> It is extremely tight on her chest, and she&#x27;s a 34B.</li>
<li> Wasted money.</li>
<li> one size does not fit all.</li>
<li> This get-up is tight!</li>
<li> Size runs way small.</li>
<li> but it was too small</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a small girl</li>
<li> Wish I had some warning if knowing the sizes run small before purchasing.</li>
<li> If you are usually a small, order medium.</li>
<li> Just beware that this is a very small piece.</li>
<li> terrible fell apart poor quality</li>
<li> Stupid...</li>
<li> they are worthless</li>
<li> It was awful and I never got my keychain either.</li>
<li> SEXII AS CRAZY!!!!!..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I order a size up but it was too small</li>
    <li> Material Quality is acceptable for the price...the outfit fits my girlfriend nicley although she is a petite Asian female... 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; 109lbs&lt;br /&gt;I worry how long it will handle wear and tear in the long run</li>
    <li> terrible fell apart poor quality</li>
    <li> First off, shipping time is like a month: they let you know this when you order it, but still a bit far.  No points off for this, just thought people would want to know.  Now, as to the garment; the lace quality is fair, but the stitching in some areas (particularly the knots that open the neck) is not great.  In the neck area there are three knot and loops that must be opened to loosen the neck enough to put it on; the first one came off okay, but the second two knots are about two - three times the size of the loops, making it impossible without taking the loops apart and re-doing them.  This could be an issue with just this one item, but points off still.  Also, it is pretty short: my girlfriend is 4&#x27;11&amp;#34; and the bottom barely reaches her crotch.  The g-string that comes with it is cute, but the fabric there is not so great.  I don&#x27;t imagine they will last too long, even hand-washing.  Now, for the real point killer: this thing is small.  Again, my girlfriend is 4&#x27;11&amp;#34;, size 0 (in some cases 00), and she couldn&#x27;t put this on by herself.  The fabric barely has any give (which is normally not a bad thing for lace) so I can imagine that anyone above size 2 would not fit this at all (and it would probably take some ingenuity for anyone above 0 to get it on).  Overall a decent item, especially for the price I paid, but certainly nothing I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Why do I try these cheap companies,  aaah ! Sucked in again!  Please don&#x27;t think they are the photos. Materials are scratchy, they are tiny small,  and if you decide to buy a larger size the fit is not right. The waist will look like a sack. This was pretty, only to sit in my drawer. Wasted money.</li>
    <li> The small / medium might fit my 10 year old grand daughter but not for 10yr old. Size runs way small.</li>
    <li> This thing is way too small.&lt;br /&gt;Girl is 5&#x27;7&amp;#34; and a size 2 and this didn&#x27;t go pass her wait. It is extremely tight on her chest, and she&#x27;s a 34B.</li>
    <li> Not all that clear on the sizing. My wife is smaller than average and is not comfortable in this at all. I think it looks good, my wife hates it.</li>
    <li> Drives the guys nut. Note that it really is for Asians though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Asian and I am 5ft and weigh 100lbs. This wasn&#x27;t even long enough to cover my bottom half. It fit like it was made for a child. I tried to wear it as a shirt but it looked ridiculous and started to frey after only one hour of wear.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and It was great.</li>
    <li> Looks great on my wife, she loved it, good fit, would recommend it to any hot blooded male as essential purchase.</li>
    <li> It is for girls on shape!</li>
    <li> Was shipped quickly, but the size runs very small. I didn&#x27;t fit into the item. Wish I had some warning if knowing the sizes run small before purchasing.</li>
    <li> Wife is 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; about 120 lbs, 34c with athletic build. Most would say petite... This get-up is tight! I give a great rating cuz my wife is sexy as hell... Just beware that this is a very small piece.</li>
    <li> SEXII AS CRAZY!!!!!.. Perfect for the wife... I LOVED THEM I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a bit tight. please add a size chart.</li>
    <li> Cute lil white lingerie.  So soft and its nicely made. No werid thread hanging out. Cant wait to wear it</li>
    <li> sexy, good quality for price</li>
    <li> Cute but small and the little buttons are hard to do alone</li>
    <li> The look is great, the panties well... they are worthless but then that&#x27;s not what this was bought for. (Also part of the rating being only 4 star)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However this biggest concern is mainly that the material does not seem to be of any quality that will last even a few washes... this is almost a disposable piece that may make it through a hand washing 2 or 3 times. A real shame because its perfect and we both love it.</li>
    <li> Really sexy to wear on. Includes a little see through matching panties with it, really cute. Thank you :)</li>
    <li> It was too small for me for a large I&#x27;m a small girl and it&#x27;s bad when I started crying when I put it in and couldn&#x27;t fit it. It was awful and I never got my keychain either.</li>
    <li> I am 5&#x27;0&#x27;&#x27;, 105 lbs and this fit perfectly. Unfortunately I dont think this would fit anyone bigger.</li>
    <li> This one looks way better up close.Great product. It has a shiny collar that you can,t tell from the ad.satin l believe..really set,s it off.And the wife said she loved it to.</li>
    <li> one size does not fit all. Stupid...</li>
    <li> Love it and he loves it to fits great!!!!!</li>
    <li> If you are usually a small, order medium. So I would suggest ordering 1 size up.</li>
