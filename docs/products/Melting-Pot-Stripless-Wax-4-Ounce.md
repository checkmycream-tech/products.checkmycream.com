      <li>Very happy with purchase which I use with the Melting Pot La Grande.  </li>
      <li>I wax at home and this is the best wax I have ever used.</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t grip the hair QUITE as well as the Bliss wax, but it is very good nonetheless.</li>
      <li>well the wax is very good</li>
      <li>and it works great.</li>
      <li>I was so happy and relived to find it online.</li>
      <li>Great Product, Repeat buyer.</li>
      <li>Not at all happy with this product, Didn&#x27;t even do a good job at remove nay of the hair.</li>
      <li>This is a good strip-less wax.</li>
      <li>Good for your skin</li>
      <li>I am very glad I did, as this fit perfectly into the unit, warmed up well, and did wonders!</li>
      <li>Best hot wax on the market.</li>
      <li>This is a really great wax product with easy clean-up.  </li>
      <li>I was kind of bummed about the size.  </li>
      <li>but it is much more effective.</li>
      <li>Love love love this wax!</li>
      <li>and I love it, but</li>
      <li>This stuff feels more like a latex when it dries and doesn&#x27;t do so well on the thicker stubborn or shorter hairs.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t take my skin off but is aggressive with the fur :)</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Works much better than the microwave options on the market.</li>
      <li>but I prefer a more wax like substance.</li>
      <li>perfect size for personal use!</li>
      <li>I have to say better then</li>
      <li>Make sure you have the machine to melt the wax in before purchasing this item.</li>
      <li>This is okay</li>
      <li>and I was able to pull out the hair to the bulbous root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Affordable and very worth it!</li>
      <li>Most of the staff i got work fine</li>
      <li>This was is a staple and a new favorite, it&#x27;s just as good as ewc&#x27;s wax.</li>
      <li>even  if you drop  some on the floor by accident it comes off easy.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fine</li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t drip everywhere, clean, even strokes with texture application).</li>
      <li>Had to use hot soapy wash rag to clean the rest off.</li>
      <li>and it comes right off, even on clothes</li>
      <li>It grips the hair and pulls it right out.</li>
      <li>it gets SUPER HOT and VERY</li>
      <li>L&amp;#60;))</li>
      <li>Love this stuff compared to the traditional sticky wax.</li>
      <li>I always come back to buy more when I&#x27;m out.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t venture into large area applications unless you have a lot on hand.</li>
      <li>this wax works very well</li>
      <li>Works great and doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of stray hairs behind.</li>
      <li>On the package, it states to set on high for 20 minutes or until a honey like consistency.</li>
      <li>For me, it took a little bit more like 25-30 on high until this happened.</li>
      <li>The wax is fine but without the La petite wax melter which doesn&#x27;t seem to be available any longer, it&#x27;s pretty useless.</li>
      <li>My only suggestion is don&#x27;t let it harden too much before you rip it off, it tends to break off into pieces and not get much of the hairs when that happens.</li>
      <li>The only thing was that the seller I got it from described it as a plastic container that  you could use in the microwabe....but its actually in a tin that requires a special wax heater.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I realized how much money I was throwing away on a regular basis by going to salons.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t used the wax so far.</li>
      <li>As far as consistency and effectiveness, I cannot lie; this product does the trick.</li>

<li> As far as consistency and effectiveness, I cannot lie; this product does the trick.</li>
<li> This on the other hand was easy to use and works well without irritating my skin.  </li>
<li> Different settings for the wax, no strips needed, you use the wax itself to pull it off the skin, which takes 2 seconds to dry.</li>
<li> Also, if you heat the wax for too long-</li>
<li> It never completely comes off.  </li>
<li> With this said, when applying try to use clean strokes with thick outer edges, otherwise the edges are difficult to remove and you are left with tiny pieces of wax in your pit, etc.</li>
<li> This is a little different from the brand I used to use</li>
<li> You do need the la Petite wax warmer for this size and after it melts the wax in a few minutes, you can use it as long as you have the warmer plugged in.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s the only wax I&#x27;ve found in years that works well and hurts the least.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s thick enough when it drys that you can pull it without using strips.</li>
<li> but I do have coarse- thick hair.</li>
<li> but if previously shaved the area it may not do so well.</li>
<li> Gigi and  less pain.</li>
<li> I was sick of spending $40 for the Bliss Poetic Waxing refills, so I got this with a warmer, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
<li> The wax did remove the hair, but when applied it was a stringy mess, and when removed it did not all come off.</li>
<li> /&gt;It has taken a few attempts to get the technique down (swirling the stick</li>
<li> I purchased the little melting pot also from another web site.</li>
<li> Yes, this took me a little getting used to</li>
<li> but I need to take a few off.</li>
<li> Totally wasted money on this item.</li>
<li> This small container lasts me for months.</li>
<li> was using Gigi  hard wax  </li>
<li> Hard to use- sloppy stringy mess and not pleasant smelling.</li>
<li> its a very small can.</li>
<li> but I was not happy with the results of the product.</li>
<li> Put the wax on a bit thicker as it is difficult to remove if applied too thin.</li>
<li> sorry</li>
<li> liquid-like making the wax too watery and difficult to apply.</li>
<li> The strip&#x27;s fabric just get stuck in the wax and breaks off, making the process annoying.</li>
<li> I found that to be a tad bit annoying but it can be overlooked.</li>
<li> I hate the strip wax.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I just recently received this product, I have used it to do my sideburns, eyebrows, upper lip and bikini area and it works great.</li>
    <li> I used to go to Sally&#x27;s or purchase GIGI but I was not happy with the results of the product. This is a little different from the brand I used to use but it is much more effective. Buy one and try it out for yourself. L&amp;#60;))</li>
    <li> Best hot wax on the market. Doesn&#x27;t take my skin off but is aggressive with the fur :)</li>
    <li> Love this stuff compared to the traditional sticky wax. Works well and doesn&#x27;t leave sticky residue.</li>
    <li> well the wax is very good I wax  myself,  was using Gigi  hard wax  I have to say better then Gigi and  less pain. and not sticky  does the job , even  if you drop  some on the floor by accident it comes off easy. one thing  I didn&#x27;t like  its a very small can.</li>
    <li> I purchased the wax based on reviews. I need to go back to using strips, this wax does not come off with a wash cloth as claimed, you need to peel it off and it hurts.  I used the wax for my upper lip, but there&#x27;s no way that I would use this on my eyebrows.  I gave 2 stars because the wax works, but I would not recommend this wax to a friend.</li>
    <li> I like this type of wax. It&#x27;s thick enough when it drys that you can pull it without using strips. The only thing was that the seller I got it from described it as a plastic container that  you could use in the microwabe....but its actually in a tin that requires a special wax heater.</li>
    <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of stray hairs behind.</li>
    <li> This is a really great wax product with easy clean-up.  Works much better than the microwave options on the market.</li>
    <li> Thought this was microwavable, IT IS NOT! Make sure you have the machine to melt the wax in before purchasing this item. Totally wasted money on this item.</li>
    <li> It works! I purchased the little melting pot also from another web site. Put the wax on a bit thicker as it is difficult to remove if applied too thin.</li>
    <li> hope works, all do i was expecting something bigger o well. Most of the staff i got work fine so i hope this too</li>
    <li> Great Product, Repeat buyer.</li>
    <li> Hard to use- sloppy stringy mess and not pleasant smelling.</li>
    <li> Had a fishy smell when warming.</li>
    <li> perfect size for personal use!</li>
    <li> Not at all happy with this product, Didn&#x27;t even do a good job at remove nay of the hair. sorry</li>
    <li> This is okay but I prefer a more wax like substance. This stuff feels more like a latex when it dries and doesn&#x27;t do so well on the thicker stubborn or shorter hairs. Lots of plucking afterwards for me. If using on never before shaved areas it&#x27;s fine but if previously shaved the area it may not do so well.</li>
    <li> I wax at home and this is the best wax I have ever used. It grips the hair and pulls it right out.</li>
    <li> This was is a staple and a new favorite, it&#x27;s just as good as ewc&#x27;s wax. It&#x27;s not sticky &amp; if you spill it let it harden and it comes right off, even on clothes</li>
    <li> Love love love this wax! You do need the la Petite wax warmer for this size and after it melts the wax in a few minutes, you can use it as long as you have the warmer plugged in. Different settings for the wax, no strips needed, you use the wax itself to pull it off the skin, which takes 2 seconds to dry. This small container lasts me for months. Good for your skin and you can do the same area over without damaging your skin like regular wax. I always come back to buy more when I&#x27;m out. Affordable and very worth it!</li>
    <li> I hate the strip wax.  It never completely comes off.  This on the other hand was easy to use and works well without irritating my skin.  I was kind of bummed about the size.  I guess I should have looked closer.</li>
    <li> The wax is fine but without the La petite wax melter which doesn&#x27;t seem to be available any longer, it&#x27;s pretty useless.</li>
    <li> I realized how much money I was throwing away on a regular basis by going to salons. I purchased this wax to go with my La Petite Waxing unit I received as a gift. I am very glad I did, as this fit perfectly into the unit, warmed up well, and did wonders! On the package, it states to set on high for 20 minutes or until a honey like consistency. For me, it took a little bit more like 25-30 on high until this happened. I found that to be a tad bit annoying but it can be overlooked. As far as consistency and effectiveness, I cannot lie; this product does the trick. It cools rapidly and DOES NOT NEED AND/OR WORK WITH STRIPS! I tried it on one application to satisfy my curiosity, but it indeed does not work. The strip&#x27;s fabric just get stuck in the wax and breaks off, making the process annoying. Yes, this took me a little getting used to but after I caught on, I was waxing away in no time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. This size is optimal for lips, face, brows, bikini area. I wouldn&#x27;t venture into large area applications unless you have a lot on hand.</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase which I use with the Melting Pot La Grande.  Very happy with purchase and shipping!</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Haven&#x27;t used the wax so far.</li>
    <li> I was sick of spending $40 for the Bliss Poetic Waxing refills, so I got this with a warmer, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. This doesn&#x27;t grip the hair QUITE as well as the Bliss wax, but it is very good nonetheless.</li>
    <li> This is a good strip-less wax. My only suggestion is don&#x27;t let it harden too much before you rip it off, it tends to break off into pieces and not get much of the hairs when that happens.</li>
    <li> The wax did remove the hair, but when applied it was a stringy mess, and when removed it did not all come off. Had to use hot soapy wash rag to clean the rest off. Don&#x27;t know if I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Added Comment: I had given this 5 Stars but I need to take a few off. The product is still the best and I love it, but I am heartbroken that cost for this item has doubled in price in a years time. A few dollars I would understand but to double makes me very unhappy.&lt;br /&gt;Best product out there for waxing eyebrows etc. I had always purchased this locally, but they stopped selling it. I was so happy and relived to find it online. It&#x27;s the only wax I&#x27;ve found in years that works well and hurts the least. Love this product.</li>
    <li> The wax did the job! I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but I do have coarse- thick hair. In terms of removal- compared to a salon job- this wax works very well and I was able to pull out the hair to the bulbous root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has taken a few attempts to get the technique down (swirling the stick so I don&#x27;t drip everywhere, clean, even strokes with texture application). Also, if you heat the wax for too long- it gets SUPER HOT and VERY liquid-like making the wax too watery and difficult to apply. With this said, when applying try to use clean strokes with thick outer edges, otherwise the edges are difficult to remove and you are left with tiny pieces of wax in your pit, etc.</li>
