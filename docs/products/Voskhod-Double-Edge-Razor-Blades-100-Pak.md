      <li>Throw the blade is a mild razor and get a great middle of the road shave.</li>
      <li>and when I first used this blade I immediately ordered them and haven&#x27;t used any more in the sampler pack.</li>
      <li>Use them with the best razor you have and you&#x27;ll have a BBS without a lot of hard work.</li>
      <li>Got my hubby a razorock safety razor and he absolutely loves these excellent Voshkod blades far better than any other blade.</li>
      <li>These blades are just super.</li>
      <li>Really good blades, somewhere between an Israeli Personna on the high end and a Lord Stainless Classic on the mild end.</li>
      <li>To me, it&#x27;s worth it at 18 cents a blade.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price for 100 blades.</li>
      <li>This is the best double edge blade I have tried yet, and I&#x27;ve been through quite a few.</li>
      <li>Sharp and smooth blade but longevity is not as good as a little more economically priced razor blades on the market.</li>
      <li>you want a very cheap costing blade with almost as much sharpness as feather, but a little more forgiving go with BIC.</li>

      <li>These Russian blades are well made like most of the ones out of Russia.</li>
      <li>From the first stroke this blade was a pleasure.</li>
      <li>At only a couple dollars more for a 100 pack over Bic</li>
      <li>those first two times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>At only a couple dollars more for a 100 pack over Bic</li>

      <li>The quality seems about the same but these do not seem to nick you as easily.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend these!</li>
      <li>They did not perform well on my mild razors (Parker 99R or my Above the Tie S2 Slant Open Comb), but they were amazing paired with my aggressive ones (Above the Tie H2 and R1 baseplates)  </li>
      <li>And coupled with an aggressive razor like an open comb or slant they blow away any beard around, at the cost of not being anywhere near mild on your face and larger learning curve for less experienced shavers.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>for the three good shaves this blade delivered, I had to do two poor shaves.  </li>
      <li>If you use Astra, Derby, Personas, and most other Gillette blades, you are in for a real treat as these are head and shoulders above those.</li>
      <li>If there is any negative to these blades, it&#x27;s that they are only good for maybe 3 two-pass shaves.</li>
      <li>The customer service was top notch as usual from anyone associated with Amazon in my experiences.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the teflon or russian elf magic, but these are smoother than Feathers and seem just as sharp.</li>
      <li>I mainly use these in my straight bar and not in my Open combs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>have sensitive skin and with this i don&#x27;t have any irritation i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s for Teflon but are very soft and not aggressive.&lt;br</li>
      <li>these are still 50% of the price of feather and thanks to the Teflon at the beginning of the first shave these blades seem to last an extra shave or 2 over Bic.</li>
      <li>these are still 50% of the price of feather and thanks to the Teflon at the beginning of the first shave these blades seem to last an extra shave or 2 over Bic.</li>
      <li>However the feather blade goes dull after a shave or 3 depending on your hair and how many passes per shave you do.</li>
      <li>However the feather blade goes dull after a shave or 3 depending on your hair and how many passes per shave you do.</li>
      <li>you want to spend money and don&#x27;t have a sensitive face use feather.</li>
      <li>I can usually get a &amp;#34;damn fine shave&amp;#34; in 2 passes with ANY blade, and a baby butt smooth shave with a select few.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Voskhod is a little more or just as mild as persona lab blues and just as sharp with Teflon coating and a little sharper and just as mild as lab blues and almost as sharp as Bic after Teflon wears off (Teflon wears off after about a half a pass or a single full pass).  </li>
      <li>I alternate between these super smooth Voskhod, the slightly sharper Gillette Silver Blues and sometimes indulge in the more expensive and extremely sharp Feathers.  </li>
      <li>Sharp and consistent.  </li>
      <li>Definitely the smoothest and closest shaves I have ever gotten so far.  </li>
      <li>but they don&#x27;t seem to cut that well, definitely not anywhere near Bic or feather</li>
      <li>Very sharp first shave.</li>
      <li>It was so sharp that I was unwilling to really get after it and even attempt to go for a BBS shave</li>
      <li>The price is reasonable and when you break it down to an individual shave, we&#x27;re talking about pennies.&lt;br</li>
      <li>blade would probably work well for a person with a very heavy and thick beard with wiry hair (my own beard is medium.)  </li>

    <li> I&#x27;ll probably earn 40 lashes with a wet boar brush for writing this, but I&#x27;m not a fan of these blades.  The basic problem is that they are just TOO sharp!  I very rarely nick or cut myself, but the first two shaves with this blade, I sure did.  It was so sharp that I was unwilling to really get after it and even attempt to go for a BBS shave those first two times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that, it did settle down nicely, and deliver two very nice, very smooth shave.  By the end of  it&#x27;s fifth and final shave, it was losing efficiency, and got binned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good is that all of these shaves were irritation free.  No razor burn at all, and feedback with the alum block was negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for the three good shaves this blade delivered, I had to do two poor shaves.  Not a bargain in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blade would probably work well for a person with a very heavy and thick beard with wiry hair (my own beard is medium.)  The price is certainly good, but for my own face there are better blades for the money.</li>
    <li> These are packaged much better than Feather (dislike how they sometimes leave glue residue).  The quality seems about the same but these do not seem to nick you as easily.</li>
    <li> Every blade is different for each person. Having said that, these blades are great for me. They are a regular for me in my rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are sharp, but doesn&#x27;t feel thin like Feathers. They last for about 4 shaves with me. I mainly use these in my straight bar and not in my Open combs.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend any wet shaver trying these.</li>
    <li> Very sharp first shave. Less so second shave, and iffy on the third shave. I&#x27;m used to getting a week&#x27;s worth of shaves with each razor but at the price it is a good value.</li>
    <li> Very good blade, right now it&#x27;s a toss up between these and the Murkur both are great shaves</li>
    <li> Fantastic blade.  Sharp and consistent.  I have a rough beard and usually need to go over it twice with moth double edged blades.  NOT with the Voskhod!  However, it isn&#x27;t so sharp that I am cutting myself, it provides a smooth shave.  Best blade for me, and I will continue to order.&lt;br /&gt;I find that I get a good number of shaves with this before needing replacement, as well.</li>
    <li> Every shaver needs to find that one blade that is both cost efficient with performance that matches their skin attributes, this blade meets the criteria.</li>
    <li> These blades are just super. I&#x27;ve experimented with so many blades that I&#x27;ve lost count. In the last six months I&#x27;ve narrow down my favorites to a handful. The reviews on the Voskhod were really excellent and they are deserving of them. The price is reasonable and when you break it down to an individual shave, we&#x27;re talking about pennies.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a fan of Polsilver, Personna Med Preps, Personna Blue Labs, Personna Reds and now the Voskhods go on to my All Star Team. Great smooth shave without cut or nicks. Use them with the best razor you have and you&#x27;ll have a BBS without a lot of hard work.</li>
    <li> My Go to razor very smooth for 3-6 to six close shaves.</li>
    <li> One of the sharper blades that I&#x27;ve tried. Not quite as sharp as a Feather but much more smooth (READ BETTER) and delivers one of the nicest  shaves you will get. Highly recommend these along with Gillette Silver Blue blades as the best I&#x27;ve tried. If you use Astra, Derby, Personas, and most other Gillette blades, you are in for a real treat as these are head and shoulders above those.</li>
    <li> Sharp and smooth blade but longevity is not as good as a little more economically priced razor blades on the market.</li>
    <li> Definitely the smoothest and closest shaves I have ever gotten so far.  Tnese are top notch blades and my favorite of all the ones I&#x27;ve tried.  Top Quality!!</li>
    <li> Slow shipping, however it is worth the weight. These blades are really sharp and last 3-4 shaves before they start tugging. Definitely worth the price for 100 blades.</li>
    <li> Excellent blades for the price.</li>
    <li> These Russian blades are well made like most of the ones out of Russia.</li>
    <li> Many things come into play with how a blade will work for you. What kind of skin you have, what kind of hair you have, how well your skin is hydrated, how well you hair is hydrated, what kind of soap you use, what kind of brush you use, what kind of razor you use and how you take care of your precious face post shave. So this review is based on me and what works best for me. This may work for you. Or not. Try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these blades. I use to use only Feather and Bic blades after trying a massive variety pack years ago. I settled with feather for my expensive blade and BIC for cheaper blade. I bought some of these Voskhod, some persona lab blues, and Kai blades to try out recently because they were not in the variety pack i used a while back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care for the Kai blades they seem to be a very mild blade in terms of irritation but they don&#x27;t seem to cut that well, definitely not anywhere near Bic or feather so if you have a sensitive face these might be good for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Persona Lab Blues seem to cut better than Kai but not as well as Bic but are even more mild than Kai which is great but they cost more than feathers which are already expensive. There are die hard fans out there. Im not one of them. You might be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Voskhod is a little more or just as mild as persona lab blues and just as sharp with Teflon coating and a little sharper and just as mild as lab blues and almost as sharp as Bic after Teflon wears off (Teflon wears off after about a half a pass or a single full pass).  These Voskhod are half the price of Feather and less than half the price of persona labs but more expensive than BIC by a couple dollars for 100 pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to spend money and don&#x27;t have a sensitive face use feather. They are the sharpest out there. And coupled with an aggressive razor like an open comb or slant they blow away any beard around, at the cost of not being anywhere near mild on your face and larger learning curve for less experienced shavers. Throw the blade is a mild razor and get a great middle of the road shave. However the feather blade goes dull after a shave or 3 depending on your hair and how many passes per shave you do. I will never stop using these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a very cheap costing blade with almost as much sharpness as feather, but a little more forgiving go with BIC. In an aggressive razor it feels a lot like feather but still not there in terms of cutting power but close. Bic are not only half the price of feathers but also seem to last about 2 times longer before being dull, practically making these around 25% of the cost per shave as feather. I have noticed that these blades are not that great in a mild razor but in an aggressive razor is where these blades shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a razor that is leaps and bounds more forgiving than Bic in terms of being mild and almost as sharp as a BIC get this blade. At only a couple dollars more for a 100 pack over Bic these are still 50% of the price of feather and thanks to the Teflon at the beginning of the first shave these blades seem to last an extra shave or 2 over Bic. Putting these blades at around the same price per shave a Bic. These blades are now added to my rotation and almost replaced the Bic if it wasn&#x27;t for Bic being a little sharper and cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing, for me I use Feather, Bic, and Voskhod. Feather for cutting power, Bic for less cutting power but easier on the skin, and Voskhod for a little less cutting power than Bic but double the forgiveness to skin. All depends on how much growth I have and how lazy I feel. Don&#x27;t shave with a feather when half asleep you will look like a cat attacked your face. Grab the Voskhod next time.less experienced shavers. Throw the blade is a mild razor and get a great middle of the road shave. However the feather blade goes dull after a shave or 3 depending on your hair and how many passes per shave you do. I will never stop using these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a very cheap costing blade with almost as much sharpness as feather, but a little more forgiving go with BIC. In an aggressive razor it feels a lot like feather but still not there in terms of cutting power but close. Bic are not only half the price of feathers but also seem to last about 2 times longer before being dull, practically making these around 25% of the cost per shave as feather. I have noticed that these blades are not that great in a mild razor but in an aggressive razor is where these blades shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a razor that is leaps and bounds more forgiving than Bic in terms of being mild and almost as sharp as a BIC get this blade. At only a couple dollars more for a 100 pack over Bic these are still 50% of the price of feather and thanks to the Teflon at the beginning of the first shave these blades seem to last an extra shave or 2 over Bic.

    <li> I bought a RazoRock TTO and after trying Feathers, Astra Platinums, Sharks chrome, and Lords Platinum. I thought maybe I had gotten a bad razor, razor burn and uncomfortable shaves for 3 weeks. From the first stroke this blade was a pleasure. After a 4 pass shave I had the best and most comfortable shave in 3 years of DE shaving. Give this one a try</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to try these for the longest time and finally got a chance to score 5 of them for a buck. I don&#x27;t have a tough beard. I can usually get a &amp;#34;damn fine shave&amp;#34; in 2 passes with ANY blade, and a baby butt smooth shave with a select few. This is one of those blades. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the teflon or russian elf magic, but these are smoother than Feathers and seem just as sharp. If there is any negative to these blades, it&#x27;s that they are only good for maybe 3 two-pass shaves. To me, it&#x27;s worth it at 18 cents a blade. I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy 100 of them.</li>
    <li> They are very good Double Egde Razor Blades for the price,&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and with this i don&#x27;t have any irritation i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s for Teflon but are very soft and not aggressive.&lt;br /&gt;this and the Astra are my ones to go.&lt;br /&gt;worth a try</li>
    <li> The best blades that gives me a smooth and no irritation shave.  I have tried feathers and crystals and have to say they don&#x27;t come close to voshkod.</li>
    <li> At this price point (.17¢ per blade) This is the best double edge blade I have tried yet, and I&#x27;ve been through quite a few. The quality is consistent and I am always able to get two comfortable shaves per blade. that&#x27;s 200 days of shaving for $17! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> These are by far the best razors I have ever used and I been going through a 75 blade sampler pack over the the last few months and when I first used this blade I immediately ordered them and haven&#x27;t used any more in the sampler pack. There is no tugging, no irritation. It is an incredibly sharp blade that provides the closest shave, but at the same time it is not a blade that feels to sharp or aggresive.</li>
    <li> These are great blades with a smooth shave. Held a great edge for multiple shaves. I would highly recommend these!</li>
    <li> Got my hubby a razorock safety razor and he absolutely loves these excellent Voshkod blades far better than any other blade.</li>
    <li> The customer service was top notch as usual from anyone associated with Amazon in my experiences.  The blades arrived earlier than anticipated and neatly packed.  A few weeks ago, a friend gave me a pack of Voskhod Teflon Coated blades to try out.  They did not perform well on my mild razors (Parker 99R or my Above the Tie S2 Slant Open Comb), but they were amazing paired with my aggressive ones (Above the Tie H2 and R1 baseplates)  I bought 100 of these after achieving a 3-pass (with, across and against grain) BBS 4 days in a row without burning or irritation.  I alternate between these super smooth Voskhod, the slightly sharper Gillette Silver Blues and sometimes indulge in the more expensive and extremely sharp Feathers.  The Voskhods are the only ones I buy in bulk due to the value and performance.</li>
    <li> Really good blades, somewhere between an Israeli Personna on the high end and a Lord Stainless Classic on the mild end. These blades do dermabrade, so use plenty of good slip soap, and a light hand, and you will be pleased.</li>
