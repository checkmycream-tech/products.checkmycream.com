### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great color!</li>
      <li>so its perfect!</li>
      <li>Also they stain the lips beautifully!</li>
      <li>And while these pricier makers have excellent products, I just can&#x27;t always dish out $25 for some gloss, lipstains, or balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not quite the perfect fuchsia</li>
      <li>The color of this balm is beautiful!</li>
      <li>, the darker colors are very good payoff they stain the lips longer than the lighter shades.</li>
      <li>a gorgeous color though!  </li>
      <li>Beautiful color.  </li>
      <li>These are great.</li>
      <li>Everything else worked great.</li>
      <li>there would be great difficulty in opening it.</li>
      <li>This is a great color.</li>
      <li>I hoped it would be it&#x27;s not for long-wear but great for reapplication</li>
      <li>feels great going on, but you will get feathering.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
      <li>very nice product that doesn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
      <li>and I was good to</li>
      <li>I would still wear it, and often, for it&#x27;s a gorgeous color.</li>
      <li>reference, I&#x27;m a MAC NC42, so a deeper skin tone, and this gives me good color</li>
      <li>The color is beautiful and glides on smoothly!</li>
      <li>i love so much great for all ages</li>
      <li>Revlon needs to put out more shades!</li>
      <li>And the minty smell is pleasant and slightly refreshingly tingly on the lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just like an eye crayon, which is nice.</li>
      <li>It has a nice minty smell like I just chewed on some minty gum, and it feels like butter going on.</li>
      <li>The good ones were 20 bucks or more.</li>
      <li>But the balm wasn&#x27;t as moisturizing as I would have liked, so I followed with some carmex</li>
      <li>easy to apply, color as promised and stays in its place for good time.</li>
      <li>The color lasts about 5 - 8 hours and is very easy to apply.</li>
      <li>They could have a better range of choices though.</li>
      <li>but it is more on the pinkish side</li>
      <li>Lovely lip-stained look.</li>
      <li>Love the twist-up applicator.</li>
      <li>love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
      <li>I plan to get more.</li>
      <li>I love the look of the product it&#x27;s shaped like a pencil.</li>
      <li>This lip balm is ok.</li>
      <li>love the color, stay all day, i can drink or eat and the color is still there</li>
      <li>Much more &amp;#34;stay in place&amp;#34; and easier to use than the Stila lip stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>None drying like many 12 hour lip products and stays on until I take it off.</li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t drying like most stains but every one I have tried have too much color, too bright.</li>
      <li>But other than that great buy!</li>
      <li>Here is a more economical one that has a nice shine (not as shiny as a true lip gloss or lacquer),</li>
      <li>This is so easy to use and after about 30 min</li>
      <li>that it&#x27;s a pencil, it makes it easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>some moisturizing (not overly), and so easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and easy.</li>
      <li>It looks like a crayon and goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>Overall a great product.</li>
      <li>glides on smooth.</li>
      <li>The application is creamy and comfortable.</li>
      <li>so I had to apply that color lightly</li>
      <li>The product is of good quality , feels moisturizer and is very beautiful, but the color is different from that seen in the photo which received fuchsia pink and purple photo is</li>
      <li>Very smooth and consistent application that can be lighter or darker, as you wish.</li>
      <li>when I first applied it I noticed a minty smell to it and also that it went on smooth and the color was very rich.</li>
      <li>When applying I made sure to exfoliate first before applying....</li>
      <li>Was excited about a lip stain, this is not what I would call a stain, have used lipstick that lasted longer.</li>
      <li>Still worth it!</li>
      <li>You will get it on cups, straws, significant others, etc.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great color, and it lasts a REALLY long time!</li>
      <li>I currently own three of them and intend to purchase more next time</li>
      <li>I was looking for a plummy kind of look and on my lips this was more red than anything</li>
      <li>Fast shipping is always a plus. :)</li>
      <li>The color lasts but I liked the old Revlon lip stains.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d have given it 4 stars if the colors they show were true to life.</li>
      <li>color is bold and seemingly pigmented until I go about my day.</li>
      <li>The color is very pretty and tastes like candy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments at work on my new lip color.</li>
      <li>Definitely will buy more!</li>
      <li>The applicator tip is large and smooth.</li>
      <li>nice .. wish it stayed on just a little better</li>
      <li>I might try again if I can find the right shade.</li>
      <li>It it looks darker mauve, it&#x27;ll probably be bright, hot pink</li>
      <li>It is bright hot pink!</li>
      <li>Vibrant, rich colors</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to put on, which I appreciate, and it&#x27;s soft and doesn&#x27;t bleed at the edges.  </li>
      <li>Creamy, long lasting, and a beautiful color.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Despite this, I love these two distinct stains and buy them in different colors.</li>
      <li>This is perfect, considering I love my lip colors to be a little on the dark side to better suite my complexion - I mix in a  little lip liner, or bold red lipstick if I&#x27;m feeling spicy :)  </li>
      <li>Stays on pretty well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pretty color</li>
      <li>I bought smitten first and was a bit dissapoited</li>
      <li>I put it on at 7:30 pm, and my lips still had most of the color the next day at noon.</li>
      <li>The color is long lasting and it goes on nice and smoothly.  </li>
      <li>A genuine marriage of &amp;#34;stain&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;balm.&amp;#34; Less stainy than a pure stain, but more moisturizing and shiny.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works wonderfully and doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips like nearly all other lip products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>very nice color payoff ( just bitten is a deep pink color),</li>
      <li>I love the thick crayon style; it is fun to apply and goes on smooth.  </li>
      <li>I love these lipstains they are great for everyday use it going out because you can make them very sheer or very deep in color!</li>
      <li>then it&#x27;s relatively easy to open otherwise</li>
      <li>If you tend to have dry lips you may need to use lip balm on top of this.</li>
      <li>This lip balm is very vibrant and really accents my lips.  </li>
      <li>I really should reapply it at lunch because it does start to fade, but it lasts about 6 hours.</li>
      <li>It does come off a bit too readily, which is why it doesn&#x27;t get 4 or 5 stars from me.</li>
      <li>I really like them for general daily use (as opposed to the richer, pricier ones for more dress-up occasions).</li>
      <li>long-lasting lip stain; easy to apply; lips don&#x27;t dry out</li>
      <li>The product itself is nice, the stain lasts long enough.</li>
      <li>and I like the color much better, if you have dark skin or pigmented lips</li>
      <li>The color does fade eventually and there is some transfer particularly if you moisturize before using it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommended though.</li>

    <li> The product is of good quality , feels moisturizer and is very beautiful, but the color is different from that seen in the photo which received fuchsia pink and purple photo is</li>
    <li> such a pretty color and has a hint of glimmer/shine.  almost a candy apple pink (not red) has a deliciousness to it&#x27;s color and really stays on!!!!  i usually apply gloss or lip balm later on after putting on because color is deep and doesn&#x27;t need to be re-applied as often as you&#x27;d think but i need to keep lips moist.  i&#x27;ve bought as gifts for my nieces i love so much great for all ages&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i put four stars because you do have to be careful not to apply too much for it can get a little bright and you do need to check it.  a gorgeous color though!  i totally recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Creamy, long lasting, and a beautiful color. This purchase is my 2nd for this color, so nowhere is one in my bath when I get ready, and one is for my purse.</li>
    <li> Lovely lip-stained look. Stays on pretty well. May need reapplication after eating.</li>
    <li> The product itself is nice, the stain lasts long enough. If you&#x27;re eating and drinking you will need to reapply (duh). My only real concern is the colour (lovestick) which looks pretty in the package but on my lips is a kind of purply pink which i&#x27;m not very fond of.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully and doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips like nearly all other lip products I&#x27;ve tried. The color is bold and even mixes well with other lip colors/products. This is perfect, considering I love my lip colors to be a little on the dark side to better suite my complexion - I mix in a  little lip liner, or bold red lipstick if I&#x27;m feeling spicy :)  I also combine this with my lip stain to add a little moisture and shine.  It does smudge off, but no more than your average lipstick. Blotting helps!</li>
    <li> Was excited about a lip stain, this is not what I would call a stain, have used lipstick that lasted longer. Will try another brand I saw on Amazon soon.</li>
    <li> ... I ordered this Revlon color.  It&#x27;s not quite the perfect fuchsia (it needs a little more purple), but it&#x27;s become one of my favorites anyway.  It&#x27;s easy to put on, which I appreciate, and it&#x27;s soft and doesn&#x27;t bleed at the edges.  It does come off a bit too readily, which is why it doesn&#x27;t get 4 or 5 stars from me.</li>
    <li> nice .. wish it stayed on just a little better</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty color and I like it but it doesn&#x27;t stay very long on your lips.  Not sure if I&#x27;ll reorder.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only worn it one time due to the fact I just received this product today. Very long lasting for me. The only problem is when I remove from my lips they start to peel. My lips never had this problem before. The color is beautiful and glides on smoothly! I would just need to keep some Chapstick around when wearing this. I highly recommended though. Fast shipping is always a plus. :)</li>
    <li> I have other stains (some that cost upwards of 25), that don&#x27;t last as long and when they start to fade it looks terrible, this is truly a stain. I&#x27;m not saying you don&#x27;t have to reapply, but at least it fades nicely.  .  Smells  minty, feels minty on the lips.  But here are some truths:&lt;br /&gt;1. don&#x27;t believe that is kissproof - it is not.  You will get it on cups, straws, significant others, etc.&lt;br /&gt;2. feels great going on, but you will get feathering.&lt;br /&gt;3. It is a stain.  I will put it on throughout the day and when I go to bed, my lips still have a hue.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is ok. The color was totally wrong for me so that might be why I don&#x27;t care for it. It goes on smooth and easy. Doesn&#x27;t last all that long. I might try again if I can find the right shade.</li>
    <li> Great color! Not incredibly moisturizing but no where near as bad as mattes usually are. Still worth it!</li>
    <li> The color is long lasting and it goes on nice and smoothly.  I like that it&#x27;s a pencil, it makes it easy to apply.  It didn&#x27;t dry out my lips like a lot of lipsticks and lip stains do.  Overall a great product.</li>
    <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
    <li> I love these lipstains they are great for everyday use it going out because you can make them very sheer or very deep in color! Also they stain the lips beautifully! I bought smitten first and was a bit dissapoited I was looking for a plummy kind of look and on my lips this was more red than anything so I had to apply that color lightly, lovesick however is similar to smitten but it is more on the pinkish side and I like the color much better, if you have dark skin or pigmented lips keep that in mind when buying these I&#x27;ve never had a lip color that mind, the darker colors are very good payoff they stain the lips longer than the lighter shades. I also have darling which reminds me of berry haute. Revlon needs to put out more shades! But other than that great buy! I recommend buying these in the store cvs always has sales.</li>
    <li> The color shown is different from the color received. The color is just awful. It is bright hot pink! I happened to find at the drug store and the color at the store is darker. What gives?</li>
    <li> long-lasting lip stain; easy to apply; lips don&#x27;t dry out</li>
    <li> love the color, stay all day, i can drink or eat and the color is still there</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great color, and it lasts a REALLY long time! I put it on at 7:30 pm, and my lips still had most of the color the next day at noon. The application is creamy and comfortable. It is not as bright of a pink as Emma Stone&#x27;s lips in the picture though, which is a little disappointing. Still, it&#x27;s a pretty cool-toned pink that I like a lot.</li>
    <li> The applicator tip is large and smooth. It&#x27;s just like an eye crayon, which is nice. It is easier to apply than the other Revlon lip stain called \\&quot;Just Bitten Lipstain Plus Balm\\&quot; (the double ended one), but I like the double ended one a bit more, which I rated 5/5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It glides on smooth. But the balm wasn&#x27;t as moisturizing as I would have liked, so I followed with some carmex and I was good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is bold and seemingly pigmented until I go about my day. It does not last nearly as long as the other Revlon lipstain. You have to reapply this sometime during your day, unlike the Revlon Just bitten Lipstain Plus Balm, I never had to reapply in a 12hour period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite this, I love these two distinct stains and buy them in different colors. I just noticed this color dosen&#x27;t have lasting effects like the other colors. I would still wear it, and often, for it&#x27;s a gorgeous color. I will try to post a picture</li>
    <li> The color lasts but I liked the old Revlon lip stains. This comes off everywhere and gets all over my coffee glasses.</li>
    <li> Vibrant, rich colors but they&#x27;re WAY brighter than they&#x27;ll look here. It it looks darker mauve, it&#x27;ll probably be bright, hot pink and it seems to develop and deepen as you rub your lips together. That being said, the color does last (not as long as the dryer, marker-like stains) and it&#x27;s moisturizing. I&#x27;d have given it 4 stars if the colors they show were true to life. Love the twist-up applicator.</li>
    <li> It looks like a crayon and goes on smoothly. The color is very pretty and tastes like candy. Highly recommended if you are into lip balms.</li>
    <li> I love my balm stain, its a little dry once it sets, but its incredibly lasting, I bough several stains, and none worked as expected, this is a kind of matte pink, that could last up to 5 hours. I have thin &amp; small lips, and it looks great! easy to apply, color as promised and stays in its place for good time.</li>
    <li> I love the look of the product it&#x27;s shaped like a pencil. The colors I like are smitten, crush and adore. The packaging was plastic once you find the perforated side then it&#x27;s relatively easy to open otherwise there would be great difficulty in opening it. The balm color is as you see it but slightly darker and your lips look naturally \\&quot;bitten\\&quot; that is it doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing lipstick. When applying I made sure to exfoliate first before applying....when I first applied it I noticed a minty smell to it and also that it went on smooth and the color was very rich. But as the hours progressed you will notice that your lips do become dry if you don&#x27;t reapply or use something to moisturize your lips. Later in the day I did notice that the inner part of my lip became chapped. The color does fade eventually and there is some transfer particularly if you moisturize before using it. I do see where initially your lips does feel moisturized like a lip balm but sadly to my dismay it is not the dream lip stain I hoped it would be it&#x27;s not for long-wear but great for reapplication</li>
    <li> This lip balm is very vibrant and really accents my lips.  The color lasts about 5 - 8 hours and is very easy to apply. I love the thick crayon style; it is fun to apply and goes on smooth.  You can line your lips as well as fill them in.  It&#x27;s moisturizing but not the same as lip gloss.  If you tend to have dry lips you may need to use lip balm on top of this. There is a slight minty smell and flavor to the lip balm, which I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pencil does not need sharpening, you just twist the bottom.  The crayon is not in the entire length of the tube, only about half way so you are not getting a lot of product.  If I have any complaint it is that you don&#x27;t get a full tube. There is no strong odor nor does the product feel heavy on the lips.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color.  I would like it to be a bit more pigmented, but I think that is perhaps hard to do with a &#x27;balm&#x27; type of lip stain.  It lasts and lasts, especially if I don&#x27;t put gloss over it.  However my lips run on the dry side so it&#x27;s hard for me to not add some gloss too, which does make the color fade very quickly.  A little bit seems to stay on though so my lips still look a pretty, slightly pinker version of natural.</li>
    <li> The only reason I don&#x27;t give this a 5 star is because the moisturizing feeling fades within a few hours. Everything else worked great. It has a nice minty smell like I just chewed on some minty gum, and it feels like butter going on. The color lasts for hours and the shine is pleasing. They could have a better range of choices though. I warn you that your natural pigment will play a part. I currently own three of them and intend to purchase more next time I have the money.</li>
    <li> These are great. I have them in 3 colors. They stay on well and moisturize your lips. And you just swivel then up, rather than sharpening them.</li>
    <li> The color of this balm is beautiful! It applies effortlessly and I would recommend to anyone. Definitely will buy more!</li>
    <li> I love the price and the idea behind these. They aren&#x27;t drying like most stains but every one I have tried have too much color, too bright. I like a more subtle color.</li>
    <li> These stay on for  such a long time!</li>
    <li> This is a great color. I find it does not get as pink as the romantic color during the day (as the tint oxidizes on your lips and the sheen is gone). None drying like many 12 hour lip products and stays on until I take it off. It does take a little bit to set, which is fine. Fast delivery and this color is difficult to find in stores. If you order it will state color burst (I think) or just bitten. Revlon has changed the name on this line.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought so many colored balms over the years, and a lot of them give very little payoff. The good ones were 20 bucks or more. Here is a more economical one that has a nice shine (not as shiny as a true lip gloss or lacquer), very nice color payoff ( just bitten is a deep pink color), some moisturizing (not overly), and so easy to apply. Very smooth and consistent application that can be lighter or darker, as you wish. A genuine marriage of &amp;#34;stain&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;balm.&amp;#34; Less stainy than a pure stain, but more moisturizing and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, these are not as creamy and lip-softening as the MAC balms. Much more &amp;#34;stay in place&amp;#34; and easier to use than the Stila lip stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very nice product that doesn&#x27;t break the bank. And the minty smell is pleasant and slightly refreshingly tingly on the lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a bunch of Nars and MAC lip products, and I&#x27;m totally addicted to glosses. And while these pricier makers have excellent products, I just can&#x27;t always dish out $25 for some gloss, lipstains, or balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope Revlon keeps these around and widens the color range. I really like them for general daily use (as opposed to the richer, pricier ones for more dress-up occasions). I plan to get more. Thumbs up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I&#x27;m a MAC NC42, so a deeper skin tone, and this gives me good color (doesn&#x27;t disappear on my pigmented lips.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments at work on my new lip color. I never used to wear any because I hate having to constantly reapply and since I touch my face a lot I always end up smearing it off, or across my face. This is so easy to use and after about 30 min it doesn&#x27;t wipe off anymore so its perfect! I really should reapply it at lunch because it does start to fade, but it lasts about 6 hours.</li>
