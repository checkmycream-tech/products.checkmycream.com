### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is the best hair spray!  </li>
      <li>Great price through Amazon Mom!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to have an unscented product.</li>
      <li>And I know the Aquanet hold is great.</li>
      <li>/&gt;probably works great on hair too...</li>
      <li>And I know the Aquanet hold is great.</li>
      <li>Great value, good product.  </li>
      <li>Great if you need a strong holding hair spray.</li>
      <li>This is a nice hairspray and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
      <li>best brand ive tested so far at keeping ABS and PLA prints stuck to the bed without warping.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My kids love this spray but when ordered it arrived with no cap and lots of spray in the box.</li>
      <li>if i am gonna bother to use hairspray, it better had hold my hair into place</li>
      <li>I will purchase more when these are used up.</li>
      <li>Better alternatives out there.</li>
      <li>Strong smell.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful hairspray that does not leave your hair too stiff and you can comb out whenever you want and it will then give your hair more body.</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s a pretty nice scent.</li>
      <li>This is just the same size as you would buy in the store but for a great price.</li>
      <li>I do also realize some things have their own natural scent that you cannot avoid.</li>
      <li>sure if it matters, but mine is in the new packaging</li>
      <li>and this does exactly that!</li>
      <li>, the top is no longer silver, the top is the same color as the canister, and the number 10 on the canister is not the same color.</li>
      <li>While it does provide a good hold, it&#x27;s flaky and extremely stiff.</li>
      <li>Every once in awhile, I get the urge to try a different brand, but this &amp;#34;heavy hold&amp;#34; spray is as good as many of the brands that are much more expensive.  </li>
      <li>even nice compared to other hair spray.</li>
      <li>Won&#x27;t buy any other kind anymore.  </li>
      <li>Maybe the scented Suave product was accidentally put in the unscented can at the factory, but I doubt it since they make hundreds of thousands at one time and that kind of mistake should have triggered a recall once they received a few</li>
      <li>This product is not only NOT UNSCENTED, but the fragrance that&#x27;s been added to it is sickeningly sweet.</li>
      <li>The smell is even decent....</li>
      <li>I ended up buying \\&quot;Aquanet Extra Super Hold 3 Unscented\\&quot; (UPC 067990600115).</li>

      <li>I sprayed it into the air to see if these new cans had the same sickeningly sweet fruity chemical smell.</li>
      <li>I sprayed it into the air to see if these new cans had the same sickeningly sweet fruity chemical smell.</li>
      <li>that holds.d\\&quot;, 11 ounce - and the UPC number is exactly the same:</li>
      <li>But this product is clearly and without a doubt scented with an added fruity perfumy chemical smell/scent.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price, and I know what to expect as far as performance.</li>
      <li>If you are really sensitive to fragrances, this might not be the brand for you.</li>
      <li>I get so busy</li>
      <li>but I recommend you stay far away from it if you truly need an unscented hair spray - unless you&#x27;re buying it in a store and can smell it for yourself before you pay for it</li>
      <li>anyone who needs and uses unscented products due to allergies, asthma, or other sinus/lung problems you know how important it is that an item is truly unscented.</li>
      <li>When I spray this it comes out too wet and doesn&#x27;t really hold my style well.  </li>
      <li>It holds really well and doesn&#x27;t really make my hair hard (depending on the amount used).</li>
      <li>But it is in fact the same product - Suave, Extreme Hold, 10, \\&quot;unscented\\&quot;, 11 ounce - and the UPC number is exactly the same:</li>
      <li>A little too much hold.  </li>

    <li> My kids love this spray but when ordered it arrived with no cap and lots of spray in the box. Not happy with no cap. Great price through Amazon Mom!!!</li>
    <li> If I could rate the hold factor separately from the \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; feature I&#x27;d give the hold 4 stars and the so-called \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; feature NEGATIVE ten stars! Yes, it is that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who needs and uses unscented products due to allergies, asthma, or other sinus/lung problems you know how important it is that an item is truly unscented. Some people also want unscented products because they don&#x27;t want different scents on their body to compete with each other. What ever the reason, when the average person buys an unscented product they seriously want unscented. This product is not only NOT UNSCENTED, but the fragrance that&#x27;s been added to it is sickeningly sweet. It smells like a combination of fruit and chemicals similar to bug spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize unscented means no scent added, so I do also realize some things have their own natural scent that you cannot avoid. But this product is clearly and without a doubt scented with an added fruity perfumy chemical smell/scent. Maybe the scented Suave product was accidentally put in the unscented can at the factory, but I doubt it since they make hundreds of thousands at one time and that kind of mistake should have triggered a recall once they received a few complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on with Suave and this product but I recommend you stay far away from it if you truly need an unscented hair spray - unless you&#x27;re buying it in a store and can smell it for yourself before you pay for it - maybe you&#x27;ll get a newer can that has the correct product inside it. I got mine through mail order (through Internet ordering) and when I finally got around to using it, it was too far past the date it arrived so I could not return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it matters, but mine is in the new packaging, the top is no longer silver, the top is the same color as the canister, and the number 10 on the canister is not the same color. But it is in fact the same product - Suave, Extreme Hold, 10, \\&quot;unscented\\&quot;, 11 ounce - and the UPC number is exactly the same: 079400181589.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3-27-12:&lt;br /&gt;Went to three stores today that sell this product. I sprayed it into the air to see if these new cans had the same sickeningly sweet fruity chemical smell. Yep. All three at three different stores. I also test smelled a few other brands of \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; hair spray I found on the shelves. I ended up buying \\&quot;Aquanet Extra Super Hold 3 Unscented\\&quot; (UPC 067990600115). I did detect a very slight fragrance but it did not linger (unlike this Suave that lingers for a few hours after it&#x27;s use, the smell sticks to the walls) and in order to smell it I had to put my nose right into the mist (unlike this Suave that I can smell from 20 feet away in another room). And I know the Aquanet hold is great. I used it in the past then could not find it for a while which is one reason I bought this Suave. So for now I think I&#x27;ll use Aquanet again until I can find a truly unscented hair spray that holds.d\\&quot;, 11 ounce - and the UPC number is exactly the same: 079400181589.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3-27-12:&lt;br /&gt;Went to three stores today that sell this product.

    <li> if i am gonna bother to use hairspray, it better had hold my hair into place and this does exactly that!</li>
    <li> While it does provide a good hold, it&#x27;s flaky and extremely stiff. Looks like you have dandruff in your hair. Better alternatives out there. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> A little too much hold.  I prefer a pump spray.  Next time I&#x27;ll order a pump, rather than an aerosol.  Great if you need a strong holding hair spray.</li>
    <li> When I spray this it comes out too wet and doesn&#x27;t really hold my style well.  I need finer mist.</li>
    <li> i actually use this stuff on the glass plates for my 3d printer. best brand ive tested so far at keeping ABS and PLA prints stuck to the bed without warping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;probably works great on hair too...</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my 3D printer. It&#x27;s great to have an unscented product. My wife likes it for her hair too!</li>
    <li> I have to warn everyone. Even though it says unscented, it is! However, it&#x27;s a pretty nice scent. (I like it anyways.) Other than that, this product does what it says. It holds really well and doesn&#x27;t really make my hair hard (depending on the amount used). I&#x27;m a ballet dancer and this held through a three hour class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will totally buy this product again!!</li>
    <li> This is a nice hairspray and the price can&#x27;t be beat. The extreme hold lives up to its name, even in somewhat wet weather the hairspray manages to hold.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair spray!  Won&#x27;t buy any other kind anymore.  The smell is even decent....even nice compared to other hair spray.</li>
    <li> I get so busy I forget to buy hairspray and when leaving for meeetigns in the morning a bad time to need some.  Buying this way keeps some always on hand.</li>
    <li> Great value, good product.  Just can&#x27;t beat the price!  Works as well as any designer brands I&#x27;ve tried over the years,</li>
    <li> Not unscented.  Strong smell.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful hairspray that does not leave your hair too stiff and you can comb out whenever you want and it will then give your hair more body.</li>
    <li> Suave Extreme does not seem to be much diffirent than other sprays I&amp;#34;ve used. You jmay like it. I can&#x27;t say anythng I don&#x27;t like about it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and I like how it performs.  It always had a trace of fragrance, but the cans I have recently purchased have fragrance that is quite noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is &#x27;unscented&#x27; I hesitate to think what the &#x27;scented&#x27; version must be like.  If you are really sensitive to fragrances, this might not be the brand for you.</li>
    <li> Every once in awhile, I get the urge to try a different brand, but this &amp;#34;heavy hold&amp;#34; spray is as good as many of the brands that are much more expensive.  For that reason, this is usually my go-to hair spray.  Can&#x27;t beat the price, and I know what to expect as far as performance.</li>
    <li> These arrived intact. This is just the same size as you would buy in the store but for a great price. I bought five to last my a while. I will purchase more when these are used up.</li>
