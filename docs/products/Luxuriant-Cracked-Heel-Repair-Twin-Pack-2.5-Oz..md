      <li>Thank you so much Melody G</li>
      <li>guess  the skin on the heels is so much thicker that it may take longer to heal than the elbows.</li>
      <li>I am almost out of this product and nothing has really improved.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>

<li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a direct result of using this, but I haven&#x27;t used anything else on my feet other than the heel repair.</li>

<li> IT IS TRULY THE ONLY HEALING PRODUCT ON THE MARKET FOR DRY HEELS.</li>
<li> After a few weeks the roughness went away and now 7 months later the cracks have disappeared completely.  </li>
<li> Three weeks of continuous use, every single day, sometimes three to four times a day, has not \\&quot;improved\\&quot; my cracked heel (I only have issue with one).</li>
<li> I would definitely recommend this item to anyone, especially to those who have extreme cracked heal skin.</li>
<li> I have been using it for years and will keep using it as long as I can find it.</li>
<li> Not a big fan of socks, except in closed toe shoes, hence the dry heels.</li>
<li> We both spend a lot of time on our feet and get dry cracked bleeding feet.</li>
<li> I had really really dry, cracked heels.  </li>
<li> The only trouble is that I have to keep on using it, otherwise the dry skin comes back.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I have tried many heal repairs and extremely disappointed with all of them.</li>
<li> In addition to receiving an apology from the company I received  samples of other products included with the replacement</li>
<li> I have used other products for my feet and they work just as well as this.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
<li> I used it for about a week before I noticed a dramatic difference, but now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
<li> When I use regularly, I completely avoid the deep, painful cracks.</li>
<li> It healed in within a few days.</li>
<li> I have been using this a few years and my knees show no signs of dryness.</li>
<li> I have seen such a dramatic improvment in my feet.  </li>
<li> It helps keep my swollen feet much smoother and less painful.</li>
<li> have also been having trouble with an awful looking elbow for years (cracked, bleeding skin and nothing&#x27;s been able to heal it).</li>
<li> This product is like a secret weapon against dry, cracked feet.</li>
<li> In fact, another issue has propped up; tiny bits of skin on the bottom of both my feet are \\&quot;peeling off\\&quot; so badly that it bleeds under them.</li>
<li> At times, especially in the winter, the cracks were quite painful.  </li>
<li> MY husband will touch them again, no more wearing through sheets and no more painful cracking.  </li>
<li> These have a faint medicinal scent.  </li>
<li> Sorry</li>
<li> I had callus cracks in my heels so bad that it was difficult to walk.  </li>
<li> , it is crazy.  </li>
<li> They were really bad.      </li>
<li> I was very disappointed when I started using it, it smells horrible!  </li>
<li> I had terrible cracked heels and they hurt like hell.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is absolutely fantastic!!!  I have been plagued for most of my adult life with cracked heels and nothing worked.  At times, especially in the winter, the cracks were quite painful.  I started using this 7 months ago twice a day: in the morning after I shower and at bedtime.  I do put on white athlete socks so I do not get the balm on the flooring and bedlinens.  After a few weeks the roughness went away and now 7 months later the cracks have disappeared completely.  When I now go for pedicures my heels no longer need to have the calluses cut away!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> the only product i use on my heels</li>
    <li> I had really really dry, cracked heels.  The kind that i had to put slave and band aids on becasue they would crack and bleed.  MY husband would not touch my feet and we were going through sheets so fast because my feet were so rough that they were causing the fabric to wear through.  They were really bad.      Then my mom got me this product and i have been using it religiously with socks every night for 3 months.  I have seen such a dramatic improvment in my feet.  MY husband will touch them again, no more wearing through sheets and no more painful cracking.  I love this product.  I would reccommend to anyone who buys it to use it everynight with socks and make sure that you also use like a Ped-Egg (that&#x27;s what i use.  I found it to be the only thing that wouldn&#x27;t cut too deep and cause more pain) and Ped-Egg or pumice at least 3 times a week til you get that initial rough layer down.      For me my feet are soft from the inside out now, no painful cracks and i love this product.</li>
    <li> It works!&lt;br /&gt;I was so glad to find these on Amazon. I am outdoors a lot wearing heavy boots and this product does a great job of helping with itching/cracking skin on my heels.&lt;br /&gt;It works best for me when applying after taking a shower.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite foot product and he has tried a lot. we first bought from a home shopping channel butthey are  not currently selling it. So, I was lucky to find  it on Amazon. This is the 2nd time I have purchased. This is the best seller. She shipped quick and shipped the correct size and included a free sample. If ordering make sure you are buying the large 2.5 oz size  and not the smaller 1 oz.</li>
    <li> This was the second supply I bought, but from a diff manufacturer.  I was very disappointed when I started using it, it smells horrible!  My husband finally said he couldn&#x27;t take the smell.  I did some research and found the product I originally purchased and reordered it.  It has a very soft almond scent.  The product does work, if you can handle the smell.  I will not reorder from this manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product. Easy to apply - great smell and works better than ony other athletes foot/heel crack cream I have tried. Update: I received a defective item and it was replaced in a timely manner. In addition to receiving an apology from the company I received  samples of other products included with the replacement</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000QFQ364 Luxuriant Cracked Heel Repair Twin Pack 2 piece]]&lt;br /&gt;I like to tell everyone that this also works for your knees. My knees dry up easy. It works great. I have been using this a few years and my knees show no signs of dryness.</li>
    <li> The people at Sparkle Beauty Products, who sell this product thru Amazon, are the nicest and most helpful I have ever experienced.  I have been using the Heel Stick with tolnaftate for many years.  It helps keep my swollen feet much smoother and less painful.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand how this stuff works, but it is a miracle!  I had terrible cracked heels and they hurt like hell.  I bought this product and I rolled it on at night and put white socks on.  I slept the entire night for about 9 hours, I got up the next day and I swear my feet were almost totally healed, it is crazy.  I did the same thing for 3 nights straight and my feet are perfect!!!  I truly don&#x27;t get how this stuff works, but if you want your feet fixed, trust me, this is it!!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have cracked heels, but I do like to pamper my feet. This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Luxuriant Cracked Heel Repair doesn&#x27;t smell really good, but IT REALLY WORKS…almost overnight for me because my skin wasn&#x27;t cracked, just dry as a bone and had hard flakes!  It isn&#x27;t oily, greasy or sticky but glides on smoothly with a rich, silky feel and goes about making my heels and feet feel soft and smooth. It rolls on like a solid deodorant, so you don&#x27;t get it on your hands.  I love it and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;ve had and used these for about 2-3 weeks, my heels have seen improvement.  The best part of this balm is that you don&#x27;t have to touch it; it works like a roll-on so your hands don&#x27;t get tacky.  I use these after I shower at night and just before bed; these also work quicker if you wear a pair of socks after application.  These have a faint medicinal scent.  The directions say use twice daily, but I use it once @ night and not during the daytime.</li>
    <li> This product is like a secret weapon against dry, cracked feet. I wear sandals almost all year and my feet are always soft and crack free because of this. I would recommend this to anyone! I used it for about a week before I noticed a dramatic difference, but now I can&#x27;t live without it. I have been using it for years and will keep using it as long as I can find it.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my elderly mother who has problem w/dry, cracking feet/heels.  I apply this to her feet after her showers, and they stay soft, with no cracks now.  Fragrance is somewhat strong, though not unpleasant - but when I try to use, my dogs don&#x27;t like the smell!</li>
    <li> I have tried this product before and I was happy with the results, and I received it promptly at a fair price. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love the way this works.  Because of the design of the product it is nice, no-mess product.  Definitely would reorder.</li>
    <li> I am always walking around barefoot. Not a big fan of socks, except in closed toe shoes, hence the dry heels. I used this religiously every night for about 1.5 weeks. I put it on, then put on socks at night (this is torture for me, by the way). While it is working and my heels are nicer, this has not \\&quot;healed\\&quot; the cracks (which were and are not that great or noticeable). It&#x27;s definitely made my heels look better but no \\&quot;healing\\&quot; there.&lt;br /&gt;I have also been having trouble with an awful looking elbow for years (cracked, bleeding skin and nothing&#x27;s been able to heal it). I put this on and it&#x27;s helped tremendously. It healed in within a few days. The only trouble is that I have to keep on using it, otherwise the dry skin comes back.&lt;br /&gt;I guess  the skin on the heels is so much thicker that it may take longer to heal than the elbows. I don&#x27;t know. I have used other products for my feet and they work just as well as this.&lt;br /&gt;In the end, paying $9.95 for this little thing just to use on my elbows - I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s worth it. As for the feet, you can get a $2 tube from Walgreens and you&#x27;re better off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;U P D A T E: Three weeks of continuous use, every single day, sometimes three to four times a day, has not \\&quot;improved\\&quot; my cracked heel (I only have issue with one). It still works for my elbow, but if I miss a day, my dry elbow comes back with a vengeance. I will definitely not be purchasing this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using this for almost two months now, as directed. I am almost out of this product and nothing has really improved. The cracks are still there (just softer looking). In fact, another issue has propped up; tiny bits of skin on the bottom of both my feet are \\&quot;peeling off\\&quot; so badly that it bleeds under them. I have stopped using this product and I am going to see a podiatrist. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a direct result of using this, but I haven&#x27;t used anything else on my feet other than the heel repair.</li>
    <li> I have tried many heal repairs and extremely disappointed with all of them. I tried Luxuriant&#x27;s heal repair and was able to walk without pain from the cracked skin. It was the first time in years I have been able to wear shoes, socks and walk without debilitating pain. I would definitely recommend this item to anyone, especially to those who have extreme cracked heal skin. Wonderful product!!</li>
    <li> This is a second order - I have used the prior order and am quite satisfied. When I use regularly, I completely avoid the deep, painful cracks. It applies nicely and works just great.</li>
    <li> I was expecting two 2.5 ,, bottles but the bottles were only 1 ounce.  This product works very well but at this price just buy it at Ultra.</li>
    <li> I purchased through Amazon and this product does works.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s extremely easy to apply and does not require you to get your hands messy. It has a very nice herbal smell and no problem putting on your socks immediately after the application. It did clear up my cracked heels and did everything it promised. The supplier also sends along \\&quot;freebies\\&quot; of some of there other products which I also liked and made me feel like I got a little extra bang for my buck. If you stop using it, however, don&#x27;t be surprised if your cracked heels come back again. It&#x27;s not a cure.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, works in only one night!  My husband loves it too!  I will recommend this product and continue to buy it!  Thank you for a superior product!</li>
    <li> THERE IS NO PRODUCT LIKE THIS FOR HEEL HEALING. I BUY THIS FOR EVERYONE IN MY FAMILY AND MYSELF. IT IS TRULY THE ONLY HEALING PRODUCT ON THE MARKET FOR DRY HEELS.</li>
    <li> This is the best I&#x27;ve found for cracked heel repair, other than shortening and plastic wrap under socks (try sleeping in all of that).</li>
    <li> the real product ...not a knock off fast delivery</li>
    <li> Sorry but I find it too greasy for me.  I prefer the one I get from Isabella&#x27;s catalogue with Tea Tree Oil that I prefer.</li>
    <li> It couldn&#x27;t be easier to use and works great.  I had callus cracks in my heels so bad that it was difficult to walk.  This cleared them up in no time and, because I use it regularly, they haven&#x27;t come back!</li>
    <li> amazing product.  it actually works as promised.</li>
    <li> I have never found a product that was so good for my feet. They were cracked and hurt all the time.  This product cleared it right up and would not be without it.  Thank you so much Melody G</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 twin packs one for my son and myself. We both spend a lot of time on our feet and get dry cracked bleeding feet. This product gave us both instant relief.</li>
