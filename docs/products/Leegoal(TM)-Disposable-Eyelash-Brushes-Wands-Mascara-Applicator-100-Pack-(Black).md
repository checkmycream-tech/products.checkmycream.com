<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The best way to ensure you don&#x27;t get eye infections.  I also use these to comb eyebrows or streak on some hair highlighter.  Good quality.</li>
    <li> cheap, good price, fast shipping. i&amp;#34;ll buy it again. recommended.</li>
    <li> just as expected. good purchase. no mystery here</li>
    <li> Nice and soft.  Came on time.</li>
    <li> These took forever and a day to get to me BUT they were exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> These are a very good value for the price, great for blending eyebrows...</li>
    <li> The handle and neck of the brushes are sturdy. I use them to comb through my eyelashes after I apply mascara. I would give the item a 5-Star review, but I didn&#x27;t receive the exact same product that was pictured on Amazon. The curvature of the bristles was not identical, but the brushes I received are acceptable.</li>
    <li> As expected and for a great price!</li>
    <li> These are just what they claim to be. Great price, great quality.</li>
    <li> Great value...better quality than more expensive ones I have used and they arrived quickly.  Will reorder.</li>
    <li> Product as described. Shipping is slow.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m completely satisfied</li>
    <li> Happy with this product as it was exactly what was shown and described when I ordered.  Although it took along time to receive this product, it came about a week earlier than the estimated delivery date.</li>
    <li> Great Price for disposable eyelash wands.  I use these to apply castor oil on my lashes which helps them to grow.  Don&#x27;t expect any serious growth overnight, but after about two to three months, you should see a difference. I used to use my fingertips, but these are so much easier to use and I can even apply the oil to my lower lashes.  Also works as a brush for eyebrows when arching. The wand bends so it&#x27;s great for angles.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re little, they&#x27;re functional, they&#x27;re cheap. What else is there to say? I use these when dying my eyebrows and I won&#x27;t be running out anytime soon.</li>
    <li> I am a free-lace makeup artist, and i needed disposable mascara brushes that do not cost me an arm and a leg. These are great brushes, perfect size, and it doesn&#x27;t allow lashes to clump up.</li>
    <li> I purchased these disposable mascara wands for makeup gigs.  They serve the purpose, but I didn&#x27;t realize that they came with plastic sticks....meaning you cannot bend the wand.  Without being able to do so, it is much more difficult to apply mascara on clients...</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.  These are very useful.  I keep them stashed throughout the house in various places.  Handy little eyelash brushes</li>
    <li> So many in one pack ! i had enough to share with my coworkers and reminded them to brush their brows so they will look nice n neat :)</li>
    <li> Perfect for lash extension stylists!</li>
    <li> It should be in every woman&#x27;s toolbox.</li>
    <li> GREAT FOR MAKEUP ARTISTS</li>
    <li> These are great and they work well for what they&#x27;re supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Great price, great quality. Thank you! will order again!</li>
    <li> Disposable and very portable. Great for travel.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used these yet but they look like mascara wands I have from Lancome.  Video on youtube- no way.</li>
    <li> Arrived as at when due</li>
    <li> The product is perfect for my classroom! The beakers work wonderful and the are plastic so no worries. Thanks! Fast Shipper!</li>
    <li> Cheap enough to be disposable, but nice enough to reuse multiple times.  I am very happy with the quality!  Great deal!</li>
    <li> As advertised. All good!</li>
    <li> Perfect but took FOREVER to get to me.</li>
    <li> Great for eyebrows &amp; eyelashes - good quality at a great price t</li>
    <li> These wands are perfect for sampling mascara to customers. Would not recommend for makeup artists.</li>
    <li> Cheap disposable wands. Just what I needed. Shipping took quite a bit longer than advertised, but that may have been because of the holidays.</li>
    <li> decent product; good price. I would order from this seller again</li>
    <li> Great product; excellent value!</li>
    <li> Great Quality-- Great Price--</li>
    <li> Shipping was slow but overall I&#x27;m happy with the product</li>
    <li> I LOVE the amount of brushes for the low price!!!! Thanks, for allowing me to purchase these items at such a low cost.</li>
    <li> Exactly as I expected them to be.  Took a while to arrive though.</li>
    <li> Great product especially when used because of medical requirements such as blepharitis, love them.</li>
    <li> First, I like it that they are disposable, with eye items this is very important. I found it easy to use after I applied my mascara to separate the lashes.</li>
    <li> I bought these for a small makeup event I was doing. Worked perfectly and I am glad I had some left over for my stash.</li>
    <li> I think, whatever your expectations for a mascara wand are... you&#x27;ll be pleased with these. I use them to dye my eyelashes, which is a very precise and possibly messy job. These wands help me keep the gel where it needs to be and separates while coating the entire lash. The wands even stand up to washing! Excellent Value! Fast Shipping Too!</li>
    <li> Nice quality and price.</li>
    <li> I use these after applying mascara, to remove any clumps.  Makes my lashes perfect.  Then I just throw it away!</li>
    <li> so cheap for all these brushes. Basic mascara brush. useful for when you get clumps or need to tint eye lashes.</li>
    <li> I am prone to eye infections from mascara and end up having to throw them out every two weeks to avoid the problem (this can happen with dry eye). With these I&#x27;m able to use it up completely as long as I never double dip. It&#x27;s been a lifesaver.</li>
    <li> I use these to clean out headphone jacks and between wires on circuit boards with DeOxit. They&#x27;re perfectly sized with sufficient force for cleaning without damaging surfaces. Highly recommended if you wish to restore fragile components!</li>
    <li> These were an absolute bargain at the price I paid. I have bought from other places and paid a lot more for a lot less.I use them for tinting brows and lashes, but they are also great for applying mascara.They separate lashes well, and because they are disposable , they help keep your mascara free from germs. A must for professional makeup artists or anyone who wants to keep their mascara free of contamination.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a freelance makeup artist so I needed these for my kit. They are perfect for sanitary application to my clients and were super affordable!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these to help shape my eyebrows. They work well, and you can&#x27;t beat the price for how many you get.</li>
    <li> I really like these and will buy more.</li>
    <li> Great product ,Disposables are great , sturdy and great quality. A must have in MUA kits.</li>
    <li> I like to use these when applying mascara to separate lashes and remove any clumps.  I also use them on my brows to blend  /smooth out or lighten unevenly or over- applied brow pencil.  They last forever but I like to discard them every few weeks for cleanliness.  You can certainly afford to with these.</li>
    <li> Disposable wands as described and came in when expected</li>
    <li> I have no idea what I&#x27;m going to do with 45 of these but for 3$, it&#x27;s just not a big deal.</li>
    <li> this was a great deal!</li>
    <li> I am not using them for my eyelashes, but for painting.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Love them, thet came in handy for my event and I will b ordering more soon! Shipping was quick!</li>
    <li> Love these for eyelash dying. Use a clean one for moisturizing eyelashes with olive oil. Keeps everything clean and sanitary</li>
    <li> I love love love these little things! Very versatile and helpful! I use one to brush my eye lashes before I put mascara on, then again after I put mascara on! (a different one) So I can separate my eye lashes, and free any clumps,if I got any at all! I do the same thing on my lower lashes as well! Then I use a new one for brushing/shaping my eye brows! Works perfectly for this perpose! I have actually been using one, cleaned every single time, to brush along softly on my lips, so if there&#x27;s any deals skin at all, it comes off softly! Very versatile product! I love that they&#x27;re little, because I keep a couple in my get away bag! Plus it comes with so many, I swear ya could not go wrong with this product!</li>
    <li> Purchased these and when they arrived they are not the exactly what is pictured. I recieved wants they are just not the shape of what is pictured. When I attempted to request them to return it for this reason they were very rude but agreed to take them back. I sent them back over a month ago and still have not been refunded. When I contact them to check status I get one sentence emails saying we will look into it. Luckly its an inexpensive product so I wont loose much for them not refunding me if Amazon cant help me. Unless you dont care about the shape of them pick another one because if you have to deal with this company youll give up before recieving your money back. Its just not worth it. Go for a different company or brand. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I like these for putting color on my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> .. I ordered these on April 1.  It wasn&#x27;t until AFTER I placed the order that I was notified that it could take as long as May 15 before it arrives.  It&#x27;s April 22 and still no brushes.  In this day and age when I have received an order over night  from one coast to the other without having to pay extra... this makes no sense to me.  What is REALLY infuriating is that I got an email that said it shipped but that there is no shipping information.  This is to placate the \\&quot;must ship in 3 business days\\&quot; that Amazon requires, I guess.  Unless this package is attached to a turtle walking backwards for delivery, there is no way that this should take 6+ weeks to deliver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;04/23/14 update:  these brushes just arrived.  They are not bad... the bristles have some \\&quot;give\\&quot; to them unlike other cheap brushes I&#x27;ve seen.  Haven&#x27;t actually used them yet as I just now opened the package, but I wanted to get an update posted.</li>
    <li> These wands are what I always needed but never knew I needed!  I use them every day to groom my brows, and I just used them to color my brows - instead of the wood sticks that came with the color.  What a perfect solution!  These wands can be re-used and washed many times - they&#x27;re just great, and very portable - they fit in any size purse easily.  What a find!</li>
    <li> I bought them to apply oil to my lashes at night, they work very well for that and also I&#x27;ve used them to comb through clumpy mascara and that&#x27;s a super use for them.</li>
    <li> These brushes work great for applying mascara without contaminating your entire tube. The brush is really soft and distributes the mascara without clumping. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These are perfect in everyway and come in handy when applying or cleaning up my mascara to seperate my lashes.</li>
    <li> For this price they are excellent brushes.</li>
    <li> I am a makeup artist and these are a necessity. I like that I can throw them in my kit and I&#x27;m good to go. Great find for the price.</li>
    <li> Great quality mascara wands - brush head is perfect for easy application.</li>
    <li> Great little brush and such a good price for a gazillion of them.</li>
    <li> just came in a small zip lock baggy thing .. ??? not really professional ???</li>
    <li> These are a life saver for an aspiring and or professional MUA. Great for doing brows and if your doing multiple faces great for applying mascara w/o contaminating.</li>
    <li> Bought these to use with cake mascara; they seem to fit the bill.  Not sure I really like the cake mascara, but may try these instead of the built-in wand on a new tube of mascara to see if it helps keep it from getting so clumpy.</li>
    <li> Some of the questions asked are &amp;#34;N/A&amp;#34; (not applicable). I got in order to have disposable mascara applicators, in order to minimize germs. They work perfect for this purpose (except that right now, I don&#x27;t know where they are). I would definitely recommend, especially if you prefer to keep your mascara as sanitary as possible.</li>
    <li> Arrived early, nothing broken. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Sorry about last review, did not realize that I marked few stars. I really love this brushes. Thank you</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. Strong n firm, and does not fall apart. Can be used&lt;br /&gt;more than once if desired. The price was good, but be sure to order with&lt;br /&gt;other products to avoid the high shipping rate.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my husband to clean bicycle parts.  I don&#x27;t know how they work for applying mascara but it would seem to me that they would work well.  They are not terribly lush but for 1 application, they should work fine.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use with my eyebrow color kit and they work great.  Sturdy and inexpensive brushes. Good purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought these to stock my makeup kit for when I&#x27;m doing a client&#x27;s makeup. They are great for general wands but too short to be used in some mascara tubes.</li>
    <li> Exactly like the ones I had in makeup class. They work, without being flimsy. What more can I ask for?</li>
    <li> Vey pleased with time came early than expected date. I was not sure since it was being shipped from over seas but everything was great and I use them nightly . I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Handy for many jobs and great value for a whole bagful.</li>
    <li> These are very nice. I think they&#x27;re better than a lot of wands that actually come with mascara. I take out my mascara wand and use these instead.</li>
    <li> I use this to apply Godefroy 28 Day Mascara.  These work great with that product.  Highly recommend so that you can use two and dispose.</li>
    <li> Came earlier then I thought it would and the wands are perfect for what I need.</li>
    <li> i love these because they are highly portable. So if your mascara starts clumping you can just just use a wand and then toss it.</li>
    <li> These can  be used for all sorts of things. From applying lash dye to cake mascara, to curling lashes, these little babies have a million uses.</li>
    <li> these are actually pretty durable. i havent lost a spooly in the mascara tube yet. will probably repurchase this in the future.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great product.  Mascara brushes are sturdy and apply mascara just a well as if you were using the mascara itself.</li>
    <li> Arrived as expected and works as it should. Adds another layer of professionalism to my swevice.</li>
    <li> Perfect little brushes take out any clumps of mascara and separate my lashes at the same time.  Also for good hygiene, I can discard the brushes every week or so and still have plenty to last me a good long time.</li>
    <li> great to use for applying mascara to my brides or quinceañeras</li>
    <li> Although the information says &amp;#34;in stock,&amp;#34; these items are not in stock. After I placed the order, my order record was updated to show that these wands would not be delivered for SIX WEEKS. That seems unreasonable for something that is advertised for being &amp;#34;in stock.&amp;#34; These are readily available in many places and from other sellers, so there is no reason to wait  month and a half for a common item.</li>
    <li> Worth the value. Arrived 2 weeks earlier than expected date.</li>
    <li> Totally Satisfied!! Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for any MUA&#x27;s kit. Bought at a beauty supply store you spend the same amount of not a lot more for less! Very fast shipping! Was delivered NEXT DAY WITH PRIME!&lt;br /&gt;Can be used with any style or brand of mascara with no need to fuss over the &amp;#34;fancy brush&amp;#34; the brand designed.</li>
    <li> DId get this item much earlier than they posted so yes happy with product and will order again thank you.</li>
    <li> Wish there could be some made out of metal, or wood, or even rubber. But, if you are in need of some quick eyelash work, these are great! They are sturdy and get the job done. I personally got them to dip in castor oil then to apply to my eyelashes so they grow.</li>
    <li> Not mascara, just disposable brushes.</li>
    <li> I get through a lot of mascara wands in my work.  These were excellent value and quality.  I&#x27;m hoping to buy more!</li>
    <li> Nice and long, easy to use!</li>
    <li> For price, quality and quantity, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Great &amp; inexpensive. I love free shipping :)</li>
    <li> Works well, you can keep you mascara clean.  I usually wash one and use it for a few applications and then throw it away and the bristles start to lose their shape.  Good product.  I have lots left.  Will buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Love them they are the same as the ones that are testers in the stores.  I was happy with the shipping because I wasn&#x27;t in a rush to have the items and love the price.</li>
    <li> It was good. The only not so good thing is that there&#x27;s a metal tip which is pretty sharp. If you&#x27;re not careful, you might scratch yourself with it. Other than that, its pretty good.</li>
    <li> The wands are good quality. I just started selling Younique 3D Fiberlash Mascara, and I want everyone to try it!  Now I can give make-overs.</li>
    <li> arrived much quicker than expected, incredible value!</li>
    <li> I believe that this is my second time around buying these and they are perfect for samples at a flea market or a farmer&#x27;s market! They came way earlier than I ever thought they could! I use the wands for samples, and then throw them in some alcohol to repurpose them! Ask me for a recipe of mascara that you can make at home for pennies at [...]</li>
    <li> Perfect! I had forgotten I bought these and they came early so it was a nice surprise! I like to use these to just even out my lashes before I put mascara on and I like to apply oil to my lashes before I go to bed. These are really great for that, the bristles are very firm and don&#x27;t fall apart. I recommend these!</li>
    <li> The package took a while to arrive, but that&#x27;s ok because these are the BEST mascara wands I have ever used. I don&#x27;t use the want that comes with my mascara instead, I dip one of these in the tube. The design of the bristles is perfect, no clumping with an even distribution. I like the fact that the bristles are hard, and they really grab all of my lashes. Makes for a sky high lash that are properly separated. TIP: Use makeup remover to wash your wands.. they are made very well, should be able to keep using them for quite a while.</li>
    <li> These work great, they are what they are just standard disposable mascara wants. I use these a lot for work doing lash extensions, brow waxes and makeup services.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed for thinning out my lashes after applying masscara</li>
    <li> Great seller and product!!!</li>
    <li> they do what they are supposed to do.  you can avoid eye infections by not using a wand too may times.</li>
    <li> They are sturdy and get the job done. As a makeup artist I am happy with them.</li>
    <li> Nicely made mascara wands at a good price. The bristles are soft yet firm enough to separate lashes and align eyebrow hair. I originally ordered these to apply eyelash dye, but I did not realize that they were sold by a seller from China. They arrived undamaged in three weeks. I had already dyed my eyelashes. Check the location of the seller if you are not prepared to wait several weeks for shipping.</li>
    <li> Handy and keeps my main mascara tube bacteria free.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s what was excepted--thanks</li>
    <li> exactly as orderd :) great for all eye lash creams lotions or product</li>
    <li> I have an immunodeficiency currently and have to keep everything, including my make-up, as sanitary as possible.  These are doing the trick... as I never have to contaminate my mascara tube with repeated use of the same wand.  These have been a life saver, quite literally!</li>
    <li> Yes they were perfect. Just what I was looking for, but they took a very long time to arrive. I use them to apply mascara and brush my eye brows in to place.</li>
    <li> Product was as I hoped it would be, and it arrived earlier than scheduled date. I love using this eyebrow brushing method over others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> FAST FAST SHIPPING VERY PLEASED</li>
    <li> These are useful cause i use these for my eyebrows mostly.</li>
    <li> these are brushes...and great for make up parties</li>
    <li> Keeps mascara clean from eye infections</li>
    <li> Great time great product</li>
    <li> I use mascara everyday and love having these spoolies around which can help with clumping mascara or combing eyebrows. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my work, to be used in lab for experiments. It is a great buy and good product for the purpose we are using it for.</li>
    <li> we are always searching for brow aids. this one lets mom add a bit of wet shadow to her brows and color them in just a bit more than they grow naturally.</li>
    <li> Great product for the money.  Pack your patience since it takes a while to arrive.</li>
    <li> Great to use with eyebrow pencil!</li>
    <li> Great quality and fast shipping!(:</li>
    <li> because it doesn&#x27;t exactly do what was promised in the article I saw in the LA Times. Thought it would separate lashes but they don&#x27;t really?</li>
    <li> They were in great condition and they apply mascara really well to lashes of my clients. Highly satisfied. Thanks! thanks!</li>
    <li> Not much to tell.  They mascara wands.  They&#x27;re very sturdy though</li>
    <li> Awesome applicator and works great for grooming and brushing out brows after being filled in!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the  product. No problems.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t what to say. Tried one and get rid of the rest of them. Totally wasting money..so disappoint! Don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> Very well made. Shipping took some time, but totally worth it! I can see this one pack can last me life time :)</li>
    <li> Were exactly as described. Complete disposable, which is what I wanted, and priced well.</li>
    <li> The wands are perfect for eyebrow shaping,tinting,and keeping mascaras sanitized. They work very well for all of our beauty needs.</li>
    <li> very cheap and useful</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to write a real product review, but I am still waiting for the product. Placed the order 11/29 and on 1/6 still waiting!  It shipped weeks ago. This is available from other sellers, so don&#x27;t bother with this one!</li>
    <li> Great product; definitely gets the job done. It&#x27;s not like using the applicators that come with the mascara, but they still work great.</li>
    <li> the wands are good but I only received 25 but I didn&#x27;t make a big deal out of that since I didn&#x27;t pay a lot of money for it.</li>
    <li> Great product and price</li>
    <li> After awhile the tip falls of the stem. This occurs about every other month applying color to eyebrows each week. I guess that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s so many in the shipment.</li>
    <li> I use these everyday. They are good quality and make your lases seperate nicely. Perfect companion to the Image Travel Bottle Pack.</li>
    <li> Just what you would expect</li>
    <li> Got what I needed for a GREAT Price</li>
    <li> Great for the price but shipping took to long</li>
    <li> Good price for large amount</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. I just bought these for personal use but wanted quite a few so I could having them in a variety of places ... the bathrooms in my 3 homes, my purse, etc., etc.  You never know when you will look into the mirror and find a couple of rogue eyebrows pointing this way and that ... ha ha ha  Mine go haywire sometimes, so I like to smooth over my eyebrows with some chapstick and then brush them with one of these wands ... that does the trick for me. Since I am the only one using them, I don&#x27;t have to dispose of them after each use ... they are well made so I can use the same one over and over. Fifty wands are going to last me a lifetime, but that&#x27;s okay, I like them and they were a great price. I would recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Product arrived early as pictured. Took a little over three weeks to get here, but it was clear when I ordered that it&#x27;d be a bit of a wait. For the price, these cant be beat. Very happy to have them.</li>
    <li> I actually bought these for another use.  I use them to clean my hummingbird feeders.  The little brushes they sell at the store are anywhere from $2.00 to $4.00  A PIECE, and these are stronger.</li>
    <li> These are great disposable brushes.</li>
    <li> All I ordered was a simple package of mascara brushes. It took a month to get here and the Package was in Chinese and was mailed from China.....I was also mortified to see that the plastic brushes package was already cut open!! Will be sending these back!! This is Ridiculous!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the product, my expectations were met and I don&#x27;t regret this purchase. Happy I bought it. AJW</li>
    <li> Great price and they were as expected! They came in two plastic bags tapped together. I&#x27;ve used them to apply eyebrow tint and they work like a charm.</li>
    <li> I use these to apply eyelash dye.  They may be disposable, but for this purpose (my own personal use), it is also easy to wash them and use them again.  50 is probably a lifetime supply - I&#x27;m delighted.</li>
    <li> Good for separating clumpy eyelashes, esp. if you like to put on multiple layers of mascara. Can&#x27;t find these in the stores, so ordering them is the way to go.</li>
    <li> I bought these to comb my eyelash extension. They worked great. Such a cheap price. I have them EVERYWHERE so I can find them when I need it!</li>
    <li> I wanted extra brushes to condition my eyelashes and you can&#x27;t use your brush that has makeup on it. It works great.</li>
    <li> I bought these to help me pull out fewer eyelashes at work while trying to remove dog hairs from my face! they work fabulously!</li>
    <li> They work great.  The item came in unbroken.  nothing bad to say.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so versatile! I use it to apply my DIY eye lash serum. I use it to separate lashes when I apply mascara. I use it to apply baby powder to eyelashes to make them longer! I use it to brush my brows before applying brow gel. It&#x27;s awesome and lasts forever!!</li>
    <li> Arrived in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what I expected them to do, great for my use.</li>
    <li> What can I say?  They&#x27;re mascara wands, great quality at a great price!</li>
    <li> These are great to keep handy to use for applying mascara or eyelash conditioner.  It is a great way to keep your mascara from getting contaminated and keeping your eyes and products cleaner with less chance of cross contamination when using more than one mascara as I do.</li>
    <li> I have lash extensions and these are perfect for maintaining.</li>
    <li> There was NO mascara at all in the brushes - just brushes.  Very disappointing..</li>
    <li> The item was better than expected! Wands were very heavy duty. Best price around. Shipping was a bit slow but that&#x27;s because it came from overseas.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about most mascaras these days.  They are very dark (I&#x27;m blond and fair skinned) and look heavy, clumpy, and unnatural on me.  These brushes let me remove some of the excess, and makes the lashes look longer and well defined.  Much more natural and pretty effect.  Works well with a second coat for a more dramatic evening look.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from these Disposable Eyelash Mascara Brushes, but they&#x27;re great.  They provide a lot of separation, nice stiff bristles.  I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> A great deal! If you don&#x27;t need mascara wands immediately then definitely try these instead of hitting your local beauty supply it&#x27;s worth it. Great quality and a lower price. Perfect! Thank you.</li>
    <li> What I got in the mail was not what the picture shows. I got a tube container of small purple sticks that I would not use to apply mascara.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use on clients (i&#x27;m getting into freelance makeup) and I like these wands better than the wands that actually come with the mascara they make my lashes look so lone and amazing. The shipping takes long but well worth it, definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Seller was prompt and you get lots of brushes i use thes brushes to add a little shine to my mascara with just a touch of baby oil on the brush also brushes help with eyebrows....</li>
    <li> Just what I needed and the right price- I don&#x27;t have to steal the cosmetic store testers anymore :)</li>
    <li> I was very happy to find these brushes in such a large quantity, as this is a very hard to find item.</li>
    <li> Good transaction.  Will recommend.</li>
    <li> The brushes work just fine. I do like them. They r firm and are serving it&#x27;s purpose. You will like them for whatever purpose you have.</li>
    <li> I have not used the mascara brushes yet, but at this price it is a great bargain and I&#x27;m so happy I was able to buy them at such a great price.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and great to have on hand. I have used them to separate eye lashes when too much mascara came out,brush my brows, to apply product,and to brush my lips when they were dry and flaky in the winter. Just apply lip balm to the little brush and gently brush your lips :)</li>
    <li> Nice brushes and well made.  Took a long time to get them.  They do stink.  Wash them before using them.  I took them all out of the bag and washed in antibacterial soap, let them air dry and got a new bag to store them in.  They are great for breaking up clumps of mascara after applying your mascara and for brushing the eyebrows into place.  I also used a couple of them as general cleaning brushes for small items and for cleaning jewelry.  Lots of uses.  Just remember to wash before using.</li>
    <li> took forever to receive, but were good quality and what I expected</li>
    <li> Exactly as described love these!</li>
    <li> These are awesome, can&#x27;t beat it for the price!</li>
    <li> Needed something small to add with another makeup item I purchased for my wife... these are awesome and she uses them often in her makeup kit!</li>
    <li> Perfect and timely delivery!</li>
    <li> Perfect for brushing your eyelash extensions.  Great product. Each client gets theirs to take home after lash extension service. Cheap enough to rebuy.. great quality</li>
    <li> Was exactly what I wanted.  Couldn&#x27;t find these in stores here.  Of course Amazon had them and at a price where I almost feel like I stole them!  Will order these again!</li>
    <li> Super easy to use. I use these to brush my eyebrows. I can use one brush for weeks.</li>
    <li> Look good, but haven&#x27;t actually used them yet. They seem a bit small for the job of applying eyelash tint.</li>
    <li> These work perfectly for tinting my lashes.</li>
    <li> great for eyebrows, an every day must! and great for combing through eye lashes to separate and de-clump too! lots for a good price! with a wand that is long enough they are not hard to hold and don&#x27;t get lost.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s a great price for the amount, but I only got 45 brushes instead of 50. I paid for 50 brushes, that&#x27;s what angered me. However, overall, the color is correct, it came in a week early and works well.</li>
    <li> Just the thing I needed. I&#x27;m so glad I bought these. They make shaping my eyebrows much easier. I recommend these.</li>
    <li> Great after a toddler brings home pink eye!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have eyelash extensions and I bought these to brush my extensions because I loose the brushes easily. They brush the eyelashes great! They will work for eyebrows great too. They are sturdy and have not had any of them break.</li>
    <li> These products are SO VERY HANDY.  They will last me a long time but when they are all used up I will get more.</li>
    <li> Great price. Great product.</li>
    <li> Nice and firm. What more can I say? Does what brushes are supposed to do. Good value for what you get.</li>
    <li> Had to use disposable wands due to eye infection and these worked great. Worked better than the brush that comes with my mascara.</li>
    <li> These are great!  Perfect for what I wanted them for and good quality.  The only reason for 4 stars is that they took forever to arrive and arrived after the projected delivery date.  I wasn&#x27;t in a hurry for them and they came from China.  For the price the wait was fine.  I was just concerned that I was being charged for something that I was never going to receive.</li>
    <li> Great deal for your money!  As a makeup artist I go through these very fast and you can&#x27;t beat the price and great quality, just make sure you order about 3 weeks ahead of time because they sometimes take a while to arrive as they come from overseas, definately worth the wait.  Sally&#x27;s beauty supply sells a pack of 12 wands for almost $5 I would go through that in 2 appointments.</li>
    <li> Great product. Just what you would expect and good quality. Just expect to wait a month for delivery.</li>
    <li> Tired of clumpy mascara?  It probably is not the mascara that&#x27;s the problem.  It&#x27;s most likely the mascara brush.  I kept buying more and more expensive mascara because I got sick of it clumping all the time.  Since I started using these I no longer have clumps.  Highly recommend these very inexpensive mascara wands.</li>
    <li> Good deal and but shipping from China is slow</li>
    <li> Tons of them! I feel like I robbed the manufacturer. I&#x27;ll definitely buy more when I need them NEXT YEAR! Lol.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon said they&#x27;d take a month to get here, but instead they took nearly two weeks. That&#x27;s because they had a very looong journey. Worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Such a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> Good quality, no issues</li>
    <li> Great!  As advertised and pretty fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> helpful little tools!</li>
    <li> I use these to apply castor oil to my eyebrows and lashes and they do the job in a hygienic way.</li>
    <li> It took awhile to get here but is good quality and I would buy again</li>
    <li> great price however the bristles are a bit too stiff</li>
    <li> I wish my order never got lost! I&#x27;m sure these are very nice to have.</li>
    <li> very handy easily disposed of.</li>
    <li> These are mascara brushes without mascara.</li>
    <li> bought these to use after putting mascara on.  My eyelashes tend to clump together no matter what type I use, and I have to separate them.  These do the trick</li>
    <li> I find these wands to be very helpful for using after mascara,to separate lashes for a more natural look.</li>
    <li> Products good.. Delivery was good..</li>
</ol>
