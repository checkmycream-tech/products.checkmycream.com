      <li>This eye butter is THE BEST I&#x27;ve ever tried!  </li>
      <li>Best Keys product I tried</li>
      <li>On with my search for a great eye cream....</li>
      <li>greatly recommend.</li>
      <li>It is the perfect eye cream for night use as it is very rich.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand why they can&#x27;t make it odorless or slightly pleasant.</li>
      <li>It is a good eye cream to put under makeup.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good deal for the price</li>
      <li>Feels good on my lid.</li>
      <li>Maybe more for people in their 20s!?</li>
      <li>It is silky smooth and feels great.  </li>
      <li>My wife liked this cream, but she prefers &amp;#34;Insta Natural&amp;#34</li>
      <li>Nice eye cream.</li>
      <li>Excellent product, fast delivery</li>
      <li>It glides on smooth &amp; feels so good.  </li>
      <li>I recommend a very light powder around the eyes for any shine you may get with the use of the eye butter.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love that this product has a 0 rating on EWG&#x27;s Cosmetics Database.</li>
      <li>I like this cream better, but I don&#x27;t like the twist cap.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m able to wear the eye cream under my makeup with no problem.</li>
      <li>It was definitely more of a night eye cream, as it went on rather sticky.</li>
      <li>At first I liked its moisturizing effect.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gluten free too... wish my husband would use it</li>
      <li>A tad greasy but goes on smoothly without pulling on the skin.</li>
      <li>This eye cream was recommended and feels smooth and creamy when applied.</li>
      <li>eye cream is rich but absorbent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;----------------RATING IS ON THE ORIGINAL VERSION</li>
      <li>ORIGINAL VERSION:&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Really rich eye butter.  </li>
      <li>Great all natural (rates very well in terms of no cancer causing/toxic ingredients) eye cream.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is wonderful for night but must be careful not to use too much during the day because&lt;</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to stay with my Intelligent Nutrients facial cream, drink more water, and see what I can do to get those 7 hours of sleep a night more regularly!</li>
      <li>I did not see anything special with this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This was okay, but it&#x27;s one of those creams that doesn&#x27;t make much difference.</li>
      <li>good and lasting moisturizers.</li>
      <li>It came it a different and better container than on the picture!</li>
      <li>I am sensitive to most everything (eczema &amp; mild rosacea).  </li>
      <li>Smooth to put on and gentle on the eyes.</li>
      <li>Well, it is too early to know if it truly does reduce the appearance of those lines, but I love the way it makes my skin feel.  </li>
      <li>I love that this eye cream is a natural product and it works really well!  </li>
      <li>They are very sensative and this stuff works!</li>
      <li>and I find that it holds up throughout the day pretty well.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pump container for which I had difficulties using at first.</li>
      <li>only healthy ingredients.  </li>
      <li>The consistently is thicker and there is quite a bit of product in it.</li>
      <li>Really, why mess with a good thing, Keys?</li>
      <li>At first it wouldn&#x27;t come out, but I ran the bottle under some warm water cuz the cream is thick, and it started to pump just fine.</li>
      <li>As with most all natural skin care product, don&#x27;t expect any fragrance smell, it just smells like natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>The problem I have is that many of the creams make the skin around my eyes feel just as dry after putting on the cream as it felt before.</li>
      <li>I would recommend for a person with an extremely dry eye area, rather than someone like me who just wants more of a wrinkle prevention eye cream.</li>
      <li>It goes on so silky, and really makes my skin feel moisturized.  </li>
      <li>Then I had a week when the skin under my eyes, one more than the other, was puffy, and at the time I didn&#x27;t make the connection.</li>
      <li>The price is great for how long the jar lasts, and it helps my more expensive daytime eye cream go farther!</li>
      <li>Pump container seems cheap and the new container already feels empty.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used the new version</li>
      <li>but nothing spectacular.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back, to other eye creams/gel that work better.</li>
      <li>Finally - a natural eye cream that works!  </li>
      <li>not sure it&#x27;s much different from the face cream, but it&#x27;s nice and cream and non-reactive.</li>
      <li>So far, no problems at all.  </li>
      <li>however, overall, I really like it.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles or dark circles or puffiness (still pretty young)</li>
      <li>I really like the ingredient list of essential oils;</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m skeptical about trying it when I run out of the good stuff.</li>
      <li>I only use natural products....and this fits the bill!  </li>
      <li>BONUS-it is really natural and has very low score concerning toxicity levels on EWG!</li>
      <li>No ugly smells and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>This was a very natural and extremely moisturizing product.</li>

<li> No ugly smells and a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> This was a very natural and extremely moisturizing product.</li>
<li> The only other eye cream I have tried is one by Lush.</li>
<li> So far, I do notice the moisturizing effects, but overall, I can&#x27;t say that it has done anything to improve dark circles or wrinkles.</li>
<li> is the only eye cream I have used in my entire life that keeps the skin around my eyes from feeling dry ALL DAY LONG!</li>
<li> However, I&#x27;ve started looking for eye creams the last couple years, and have been particularly looking for ones with few foreign chemicals, though I have tried one anti-aging eye cream.</li>
<li> Since my skin is very dry overall, this cream is a gift.</li>
<li> Very moisturizing to the delicate eye area.</li>
<li> It works for me because I tend to get very dry around the eye area.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t like the wet look under my eyes.</li>
<li> USE A SMALL AMOUNT, really, barely push down the pump.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
<li> eye make up will come off due to the cream.</li>
<li> If you need something extremely heavy due to very dry skin this is the product.&lt;br</li>
<li> and I have tried at least 20 different kinds.</li>
<li> just a small amount goes a long way.  </li>
<li> Average.</li>
<li> Can be used during the day as well just use a little less.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s heavier than other eye creams and I&#x27;m not sure that it absorbs as well as  the lighter creams.  </li>
<li> but, the little bits I had are no longer noticeable.  </li>
<li> I ended up seeing my acupuncturist and an herbalist about this... and it went away within a few days to a week.</li>
<li> However, it was little too thick and moisturizing for me, as it was clogging pores and causing milia under my eyes.</li>
<li> saw they changed the formula where now it a foam, not in the small bottle.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, however, after a few weeks orange mold appeared on the surface of the butter</li>
<li> This eye cream is very thick</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very thick and creamy -</li>
<li> so there is 0 chance of missing any!!!!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve emailed and rung the manufacturers but received no reply and have been unable to return my jar as there is no address on the website.</li>
<li> It is also a bit greasy--perhaps because of the vegetable wax which is used as the base for the oils....</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It&#x27;s a pump container for which I had difficulties using at first. Was not as pictured.</li>
    <li> not sure it&#x27;s much different from the face cream, but it&#x27;s nice and cream and non-reactive.</li>
    <li> My wife liked this cream, but she prefers &amp;#34;Insta Natural&amp;#34; Night Cream now.</li>
    <li> It is silky smooth and feels great.  I love it. No ugly smells and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product at a health food store, enough to use it several times. At first I liked its moisturizing effect. Then I had a week when the skin under my eyes, one more than the other, was puffy, and at the time I didn&#x27;t make the connection. I ended up seeing my acupuncturist and an herbalist about this... and it went away within a few days to a week. That was 4-6 weeks ago. Then last night I used the cream again, and guess what... puffy under the eyes again this morning! I&#x27;m going to stay with my Intelligent Nutrients facial cream, drink more water, and see what I can do to get those 7 hours of sleep a night more regularly!</li>
    <li> This eye cream was recommended and feels smooth and creamy when applied. Unfortunately, however, after a few weeks orange mold appeared on the surface of the butter and I had to stop using it when itching occurred around my eyes. I&#x27;ve emailed and rung the manufacturers but received no reply and have been unable to return my jar as there is no address on the website.</li>
    <li> Average. I did not see anything special with this product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the wet look under my eyes. The combination of ingredients I could of made it myself. Pump container seems cheap and the new container already feels empty.</li>
    <li> I really like the ingredient list of essential oils; no chemicals.  it&#x27;s heavier than other eye creams and I&#x27;m not sure that it absorbs as well as  the lighter creams.  It is also a bit greasy--perhaps because of the vegetable wax which is used as the base for the oils....however, overall, I really like it.  It&#x27;s a good deal for the price and I find that it holds up throughout the day pretty well.  It works for me because I tend to get very dry around the eye area.  I recommend a very light powder around the eyes for any shine you may get with the use of the eye butter.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is the BEST of the best and I have tried at least 20 different kinds. BONUS-it is really natural and has very low score concerning toxicity levels on EWG!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, fast delivery</li>
    <li> Best Keys product I tried but the smell could still stand improvement. I don&#x27;t understand why they can&#x27;t make it odorless or slightly pleasant.</li>
    <li> i like Keys regular cream and eye butter cream. good and lasting moisturizers. eye cream is rich but absorbent. greatly recommend.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a pump container. Pump never worked. Sawed it open. Ick. Recommend you purchase only in jar form.</li>
    <li> I have psorasis and it effects my eyes. They are very sensative and this stuff works! Only thing I would change is the container. I would rather it be in a jar not a pump so there is 0 chance of missing any!!!! That&#x27;s what I had last time but couldn&#x27;t find it when I ordered this time.</li>
    <li> Feels good on my lid.</li>
    <li> I purchased this since there wasn&#x27;t any retinol and I needed eye cream desperately.&lt;br /&gt;This was okay, but it&#x27;s one of those creams that doesn&#x27;t make much difference. Felt like a lotion but nothing spectacular.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back, to other eye creams/gel that work better. On with my search for a great eye cream....</li>
    <li> Did not deliver the results I was hoping for. Maybe more for people in their 20s!? It came it a different and better container than on the picture!</li>
    <li> A tad greasy but goes on smoothly without pulling on the skin. Does what it says it is supposed to do!</li>
    <li> I love that this product has a 0 rating on EWG&#x27;s Cosmetics Database. It is the perfect eye cream for night use as it is very rich. Can be used during the day as well just use a little less.</li>
    <li> If you need something extremely heavy due to very dry skin this is the product.&lt;br /&gt;It is wonderful for night but must be careful not to use too much during the day because&lt;br /&gt;your eye make up will come off due to the cream.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I&#x27;m 29 and not an eye cream expert. However, I&#x27;ve started looking for eye creams the last couple years, and have been particularly looking for ones with few foreign chemicals, though I have tried one anti-aging eye cream. The problem I have is that many of the creams make the skin around my eyes feel just as dry after putting on the cream as it felt before. This is definitely not the case with the Keys Eye Butter. My skin feels moisturized, but at the same time not greasy. I&#x27;m able to wear the eye cream under my makeup with no problem.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this product. It&#x27;s very thick and creamy - I would not personally recommend it as a day cream - but it stays with me all night and the skin around my eyes still feels moisturized in the morning. The price is great for how long the jar lasts, and it helps my more expensive daytime eye cream go farther! I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles or dark circles or puffiness (still pretty young) but of course I use eye cream for preventative measures - and this stuff \\&quot;fits the bill\\&quot; perfectly!</li>
    <li> I love that this eye cream is a natural product and it works really well!  It&#x27;s gluten free too... wish my husband would use it</li>
    <li> Great all natural (rates very well in terms of no cancer causing/toxic ingredients) eye cream. USE A SMALL AMOUNT, really, barely push down the pump. At first it wouldn&#x27;t come out, but I ran the bottle under some warm water cuz the cream is thick, and it started to pump just fine. As with most all natural skin care product, don&#x27;t expect any fragrance smell, it just smells like natural ingredients. Very moisturizing to the delicate eye area.</li>
    <li> This was a very natural and extremely moisturizing product. It was definitely more of a night eye cream, as it went on rather sticky. However, it was little too thick and moisturizing for me, as it was clogging pores and causing milia under my eyes. I would recommend for a person with an extremely dry eye area, rather than someone like me who just wants more of a wrinkle prevention eye cream.</li>
    <li> Really rich eye butter.  A little goes a long way.  I am sensitive to most everything (eczema &amp; mild rosacea).  So far, no problems at all.  My undereye feels firmer when I put it on.</li>
    <li> The only other eye cream I have tried is one by Lush. I like this cream better, but I don&#x27;t like the twist cap. I would prefer it to be  pump. The consistently is thicker and there is quite a bit of product in it. So far, I do notice the moisturizing effects, but overall, I can&#x27;t say that it has done anything to improve dark circles or wrinkles. It is a good eye cream to put under makeup.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is very thick and I use this for night only.  It is too greasy for day use or under makeup.</li>
    <li> Finally - a natural eye cream that works!  Well, it is too early to know if it truly does reduce the appearance of those lines, but I love the way it makes my skin feel.  It goes on so silky, and really makes my skin feel moisturized.  Since my skin is very dry overall, this cream is a gift.</li>
    <li> ORIGINAL VERSION:&lt;br /&gt;This is the only eye cream I have used in my entire life that keeps the skin around my eyes from feeling dry ALL DAY LONG! I will now use no other.&lt;br /&gt;----------------RATING IS ON THE ORIGINAL VERSION ONLY--------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;EDITED VERSION:&lt;br /&gt;I saw they changed the formula where now it a foam, not in the small bottle. I haven&#x27;t used the new version and I&#x27;m skeptical about trying it when I run out of the good stuff. Really, why mess with a good thing, Keys? Why?</li>
    <li> Nice eye cream. Smooth to put on and gentle on the eyes. I actually bought it for my puffy eyelids but it does not do anything for that.</li>
    <li> This eye butter is THE BEST I&#x27;ve ever tried!  I only use natural products....and this fits the bill!  Contains no water or alcohol.....only healthy ingredients.  It glides on smooth &amp; feels so good.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months, day &amp; night, and have never had any issues with it.  I&#x27;m 53, but, have almost no visible lines around my eyes.....In just this short amount of time, its made a world of difference.  I&#x27;m not saying I had deep lines before....but, the little bits I had are no longer noticeable.  I also use organic olive oil on my face...and these two items together are trans-formative!  An excellent product! Not greasy at all.....just a small amount goes a long way.  I&#x27;ve recommended it to everyone I know.</li>
