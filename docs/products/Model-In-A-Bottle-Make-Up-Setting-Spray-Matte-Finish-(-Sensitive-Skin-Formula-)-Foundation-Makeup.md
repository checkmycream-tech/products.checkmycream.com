      <li>The smell is amazing.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>This product is truly amazing.</li>
      <li>This product was amazing.  </li>
      <li>and the product is simply amazing.  </li>
      <li>I always buy this setting spray because it works amazing</li>
      <li>Am working on my own homemade formula to save some money though--</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to purchase again but am very glad I had.</li>
      <li>When I do get a good even spray, it has a strong alcohol smell to it.  </li>
      <li>has a very strong smell,&lt;br /&gt;*And</li>
      <li>I bought some before going to hot and humid (yet beautiful) Florida and used it every day there and not once did my make-up melt off.  </li>
      <li>Which is wonderful for any skin type and a natural primer for makeup.</li>
      <li>That was the true test for me!!  </li>
      <li>sprays a very fine mist.  </li>
      <li>My favorite makeup setting spray- the sensitive skin formula is the best.</li>
      <li>First of all, it doesn&#x27;t spray very well at all (kind of spotty/blotchy is the best way I can describe it).  </li>
      <li>Since this item cannot be Returned and I am stuck with 2 bottles of it, I am going to try to start using it more often</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>I will make sure to purchase again.</li>
      <li>per ingredient list is mostly alcohol</li>
      <li>I feel my makeup looks better longer and the shiny areas of my face don&#x27;t get as shiny.  </li>
      <li>but I paid more for this....</li>
      <li>My makeup stays put all day even in the hottest, most humid weather.</li>
      <li>Her makeup stayed flawless throughout the before photo sessions, the ceremony, the after photo session and the entire reception.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I read many beauty blogs and subscribe to many youtube channels about makeup and beauty.  </li>
      <li>I have read so many reviews on this make up setter</li>
      <li>It is not mattifying and has not been able to keep my makeup in place.</li>
      <li>so sure it is helping with that either.</li>
      <li>Literally allows makeup to last, looking flawless all day/night.</li>
      <li>This is simply the best setting spray!  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I used this with Neutrogena Healthy Skin Enhancer.</li>
      <li>But I wish it came out as more of a mist, instead of a stream.</li>
      <li>After you spray it on your face be sure to wait the 30 seconds and then don&#x27;t touch your face after that for a minute or so.</li>
      <li>cuz I did not have any reaction :)</li>
      <li>Not as pleased with this setting spray as I thought I would be.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Works okay</li>
      <li>The product worked ok...</li>
      <li>No to sure yet...</li>
      <li>Maybe if I use waterproof mascara and eyeliner it will stay better.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>but most importantly it has an amazing price :)</li>
      <li>It smells refreshing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Sprayed at least a foot away from my face and it left spots, like liquid spots, in my makeup.  I use bareminerals and you could clearly see that I had sprayed something on my face.  Wont use again.  I would return it if I could.</li>
    <li> This product was great, however, even though it stated sensitive skin...........I broke out with a rash!!!!!!!  My skin is uber sensitive and i try to stick to products that says sensitive skin or hypoallergenic.  Even though i broke out with a rash, it did the job of keeping me shine free and keeping my makeup in check.  It just didn&#x27;t work as well on my sensitive skin issue.</li>
    <li> Great for my wedding day - set my make up to where I had no problems all day.  I didn&#x27;t even need to touch up.</li>
    <li> Seemed like it was water and was not the actual product</li>
    <li> Does great.  Keeps makeup from disappearing in hot weather and keeps it looking fresh longer.</li>
    <li> Amazing to set your make up for the entire day! You look flawless from morning to night!</li>
    <li> This is the only setting spray I have ever used, and my second time purchasing this product. The way it keeps my eye makeup from budging is nothing short of miraculous. Without this spray, my eyeshadow and mascara would turn into raccoon eyes within a couple hours. With this spray, I once fell asleep without washing my face and woke up in the morning with my makeup looking as if I just applied it! I have sensitive, acne prone skin and I have never experienced irritation or breakouts as a result of using Model in a Bottle. That being said, I wear makeup only occasionally and do not have to use this spray more than a few times a month.</li>
    <li> Leaves a sticky residue on face. It will burn any of your dry/sensitive skin, also your eyes. Too harsh to be labeled as &amp;#34;sensitive.&amp;#34; Does little to nothing in oil control.</li>
    <li> Hello! I wrote another review for this product after the first try and it was pretty indifferent towards the product. However, after about a month of use, I DO see a difference with how much I need to reapply my \\&quot;face\\&quot; so I would recommend it to someone like me who checks on their makeup several times a day... It has made my life a bit better and I will buy again!</li>
    <li> This stuff is hardcore awesome! It will keep your makeup in place for hours upon hours! I have VERY oily skin, especially when I go out and get hot, but this will keep your makeup lasting and looking great! I will but this product until the end of time♡</li>
    <li> Discusting product not my money back</li>
    <li> I love this! my makeup dont move at all and I also use it in my makeup kit and spray it on my dancers, they dance for hours sweat and everything and the makeup is like new every time. I have to say its a thrill for something to work so well and I will continue to use it in my kit and in life!</li>
    <li> This product is so awesome! Just a couple of sprays in the morning and I&#x27;m good to go all days!</li>
    <li> Highly disappointed ! I got this product because Carli (makeup artist on YouTube) recommended it but this was horrible ! I had never used setting spray before so I didn&#x27;t know how it would work or what to expect. The first time I used it the spray came so hard on my face and not even ! So I was left with water spots . I ignored it thinking maybe this is how it works . Throughout the day if I touched my face or tried to retouch my makeup  the makeup would like ball up if that makes sense and come off! Every time it happened ! I&#x27;m not sure what the hell !</li>
    <li> This certainly did not live up to expectations or claims.  The product did not work for me.  My make-up stayed on no better than before use. Save your money!</li>
    <li> Product works great!  This is my wife&#x27;s second bottle.  Keeps makeup in place even when sweating.  However the product came without a straw attached to the spray nozzle. Therefore you can&#x27;t spray it.</li>
    <li> great stuff. it works.</li>
    <li> I use primer and mac studio fix liquid foundation. This spray bottle is not very good, but I read reviews before I purchased so I also purchased a spray bottle. It extended the wear of my makeup but not significantly enough for me to purchase again. I will be trying another brand.  I do not know if this is ideal but my friend did use it on her bare face on a night out to see if it would reduce shine and it did. Sometimes it made weird spots in my makeup.</li>
    <li> Honestly, not for sensitive skin at all. I put it on my face over my makeup and immediately my skin felt as if it had just been burned. The stinging sensation and redness lasted for nearly an hour. On top of that my makeup did not stay in place all that  great.</li>
    <li> Was dying to try this product from YouTube. Definitely foes the job I can rub and it will keep my makeup in place. Even though that&#x27;s a very good quality a setting spray can have here&#x27;s my problem.&lt;br /&gt;1. The smell....I hate lavender.&lt;br /&gt;2. If I was to scratch my skin with my nail the makeup would come off in a clump as if its just sitting on my face a problem I don&#x27;t have with other setting sprays.&lt;br /&gt;3. You have to let your makeup dry before applying it or I will run and i mean run ( time I don&#x27;t have)&lt;br /&gt;4. It makes your makeup feel heavy and sticky if you sweat.&lt;br /&gt;So I can ditch the no smear goodness because of these downers.</li>
    <li> I have had this product in the past. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to purchase again but am very glad I had. It came super quickly and was just as described. I have oily skin and the matte finish this product gives leaves my makeup looking up to par for the entire day!!</li>
    <li> Helps your makeup stay on all day!</li>
    <li> It looked okay at first upon spraying it, but hours later I looked in the mirror and was horrified to see that my foundation was flaking off. My entire face was flakey, so I had to wipe my foundation off with a tissue, which wasn&#x27;t that hard... So much for being budge free though. The formula smells like rubbing alcohol...which isn&#x27;t surprising, as the first ingredient listed is \\&quot;SD Alcohol 40B\\&quot;.  Not very surprising that it caused flakiness, as I believe alcohol dries out your skin.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I had been wanting to try this for a while and finally ordered it. this makes my make up last all day!!</li>
    <li> I use this product several times a week and absolutely love it! It doesn&#x27;t cause you to break out or dry out your skin like the original formula does. My makeup stays put all day even in the hottest, most humid weather. The way the bottle is designed, however, does make it hard to get the spray out at times. If they re-designed the bottle this would be perfect.</li>
    <li> Great Product. I work on a busy floor in the hospital and this makes my make-up stay put and last all day. First time I used it, it did sting a little bit, but my skin is VERY sensitive and I used too much. When applying I spray one pump in the sink to get the mist going and then spray one or two into the air and let it fall gently onto my upturned face. Works like a charm every time.</li>
    <li> This is simply the best setting spray!  I look the same in the evening as I do when just finishing my makeup after using the spray.  I have tried less expensive setting sprays with disappointing results.</li>
    <li> The spray itself works well.  My only issue is the bottle itself sprays very harshly, not like a mist at all.  This takes a lot away from the functionality of the product over all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a setting spray before. I&#x27;ve heard of them, but what got me curious to try this was a makeup guru on YouTube Kandee. She had model in a bottle in one if her videos (sensitive formula) and she said was in southern heat/humidity and makeup stayed in place. I know of the original formula, but they say sensitive is good for people with rosacea and its fragrance free. I ordered mine on eBay for $17+free ship. Holy smokes! I did my makeup, sprayed 2 times and wow, the results are amazing. My eye shadow, mascara, eyeliner did NOT move one bit over 7+ hours. I live in NC and it can get pretty humid mid July. Everything from my foundation, blush to my eyeliner stayed put! The scent is a light lavender and doesn&#x27;t bother me. Just one little thing I wish it sprayed more of a fine mist. The nozzle sprays more narrow and not wide. Solid 4 stars!</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t press hard enough it will squirt out in one spot on your face, so make sure to not be afraid to spray your face with it so it mists all over. Otherwise it&#x27;s a great product and and keeps your makeup in place. For those hotter days, bring your brushes with you so you can rebrush your makeup to get rid of the shininess.</li>
    <li> I was so excited for this... Until i tried it.  First the way the spray comes out is awful.  Your left with droplets all over your face.  Second the smell.... It says lavender but that is no lavender its a strong chemical smell.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin so i knew it was bad when i sprayed it and it burn so bad. So once i got passed all that i was like ok fine let&#x27;s see how it works..... It pretty much makes every pore in your skin show.  It felt sticky and my make up didn&#x27;t last.. It started to slide all over and if i would touch it it would come off in clumps.  I&#x27;ve tryed it multiple times with different foundations thinking that was the problem but the results are always the same.  Like i said i was so excited to get it</li>
    <li> Works well for me! Cheaper then mac&#x27;s fix plus so it&#x27;s worth it! Only con is that it doesn&#x27;t smell that great. But besides that it works! It&#x27;s like hairspray for your face!</li>
    <li> I have been using an Urban Decay product (which I really like) for a few years and decided to try Model in a Bottle since I read some great reviews.  What I don&#x27;t like is that the sprayer is not a fine mist but like spraying yourself in the face with a squirt bottle.  It just seems too &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; of a spray to even want to point it in your face to spray it.  I have used it 3 times and I cannot say the actual product works any better than what I was using before.  I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I tried the Urban Decay spray before but I didn&#x27;t like it that much . This one on the other hand holds my make up in place the whole day........ Absolutely awesome😊</li>
    <li> This is my first makeup setting spray and it kind of stings my face when I first apply it but it does what it is supposed to and makes my makeup last longer.  I used it when we went to an amusement park last week and my makeup stayed on all day even though I sweated and rode some water rides.  If it didn&#x27;t sting at first I would give it five stars.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd bottle. It works!  It keeps your makeup on all day. I only reapply lipstick.  I love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the perfect spray to set my makeup.  Works well with my sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate or burn.  Love-Love-Love it!</li>
    <li> Made my make up last all day, no need for touch ups. The added moisture of the spray helped make my tinted foundation cream look more natural like my own skin. I used this with Neutrogena Healthy Skin Enhancer. The combination of the two has people believing I have naturally beautiful skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only rated 4 stars however and even considered giving it 3 only because I wanted this spray to waterproof my make up as some sites claim it will do but which it did not.</li>
    <li> This stuff was very effective at keeping my mascara and eyeliner in place all night and through to the next morning with no smearing or running (through many wedding tears). However, when I sprayed it over my base and powder, it made my face VERY shiny. I suggest applying all eye makeup, spraying the setting spray, allowing it to dry COMPLETELY, then finishing with facial make up on top of it.</li>
    <li> Totally grossed out. They sent me a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; bottle with nasty floating things in it! I have purchased this product in stores… and it NEVER looks like that! Amazon had my back and I did get a refund, but do yourself a favor and DONT buy this online.</li>
    <li> This is a good setting spray! I have both kinds of Model in a Bottle, this one gives a dewy finish. It also makes your make-up really last I pair it with Milani eyeshadow primer for a creaseless long day! You should consider grabbing both of these setting sprays. I love em! They did change the bottles, its a tubeless, ball and socket (sort of system) it works much better than their old bottle. Love!</li>
    <li> love this, it works, keeps my makeup in tact all day even when I dance salsa &amp; sweat! it hasn&#x27;t made me break out either.</li>
    <li> I loved this product the first time I used it. My makeup says well all day long. I do have to still use a primer and use powder or blot throughout the day, as my skin is quite oily. Also I think it may be irritating my skin and breaking me out even though it is the sensitive solution. I have decided to not use it everyday because of that, but I do like what it does. It smells a little odd the first time you use it but I haven&#x27;t noticed the smell since. After you spray it on your face be sure to wait the 30 seconds and then don&#x27;t touch your face after that for a minute or so. It may still look wet but that clears up after a minute or so.</li>
    <li> Good product, great seller, thank you!</li>
    <li> I tried the normal Model in a Bottle and noticed it stung a little on my face so I wanted to give this Sensitive Solution a try.  Same lasting formula but without the stinginess from the original! will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> Made my skin crazy oily. Would throw it away if i could remember where i put it</li>
    <li> Not sure if its just me but im not liking the way i look after i spray my face. Its not appearing matte like i was expecting. I find myself applying more powder to my face after i spray to get back the matte look i had bf i sprayed which kinda defeats the purpose of this product! LOL! As far as my makeup staying put, im really not so sure it is helping with that either. Perhaps its bc i have oily skin and thus i havent noticed that my makeup is any different from before. I still need to constantly blot my face with oil absorbing sheets. Sorry thats my input. Hope that helps</li>
    <li> Not as pleased with this setting spray as I thought I would be. It is not mattifying and has not been able to keep my makeup in place. Much prefer Mac or makeup forever.</li>
    <li> love!!!! love!!!!! love!!!!</li>
    <li> After completing my makeup application, I applied Model in a Bottle and it made my face shiny and sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Not happy with the product and will not recommend Model in a bottle to anyone.</li>
    <li> I was happy that item arrived quickly, but when I opened the package, the bottle was empty!!!  I couldnt even return or get my money back because it is considired hazardous liquid.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.  Don&amp;#34;t Purchase this item.</li>
    <li> I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 only because the sprayer got clogged up after about 15 uses and now sprays unevenly. This keeps my foundation on until the end of my workday at least. Make sure mascara is dry before using or it will smear.  A great product otherwise.</li>
    <li> *I did not get the one like in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;*It has a very strong smell,&lt;br /&gt;*And it burns my face.</li>
    <li> Like it better than all the others! I have bought several bottles and love the new packaging/bottle.  Glad they make a formula for my sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what to say. I mean it does hold ur makeup. Once I&#x27;m outside or began to sweat. There is no touching ur face. I feel when I pat it. It removes my makeup. Kinda like a layer of tape that&#x27;s lifted it seems like. I cannot use my sunglasses. If I do. Theres ring left on my nose. From where the glasses have lifted makeup in that spot. It&#x27;s ok in fresh weather. I don&#x27;t use outside.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used yet and didn&#x27;t realize the bottle was so small!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the hype on this, i saw nothing different. I used up the entire bottle hoping to see some magic but..nothing.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first about this product. I have tried UD all nighter and macs finishing spray but this product is different. It holds your makeup better than UD, it does have a slight fragrance but it doesnt bother me.  I partied all night and my face stayed put.</li>
    <li> I was totally unaware that this product was not returnable due to the \\&quot;flammable nature\\&quot;. I had high hopes for this product. My make-up is usually gone by the middle of the work day,so I was really hoping this product would work its wonders on me. This product did not do anything for me but make my skin looked cracked. The imperfections on my skin were magnified x100. It was pretty horrifying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going back to my urban decay all nighter spray. I was really hoping that this would be a good product. Utterly disappointed in the return policy.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the speedy delivery and the service of the seller. The product itself I have yet to evaluate, since the first time I used it I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with it. I will give it a few more tries and see if I like it as much as my all nighter Urban Decay.</li>
    <li> I read many beauty blogs and subscribe to many youtube channels about makeup and beauty.  One of the makeup artists that I really like, recommended this setting spray.  I usually love all of the products this makeup artist recommends but I&#x27;m not too wild about this one.  First of all, it doesn&#x27;t spray very well at all (kind of spotty/blotchy is the best way I can describe it).  When I do get a good even spray, it has a strong alcohol smell to it.  I am not sensitive to smells so this isn&#x27;t a big deal to me but it might be a factor to other people.  As far as how well it sets my makeup, eh....... I think my inexpensive e.l.f. setting spray that costs about $3 does just as good of a job.  Will I purchase this product again? I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
    <li> Used the product once. My face felt sticky and I had to use powder over it. My make-up didn&#x27;t last any longer than usual. It smells like rubbing alcohol, which it probably is. I could have bought that at the drugstore for 59 cents.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this 3 times &amp; its sticky &amp; everytime I spray it on it sprays out crazy &amp; when it hits my lips accidentally it burns or turns my lips red &amp; I will NOT purchase again</li>
    <li> I feel the same as many other reviewers here. While the product didn&#x27;t make my make-up flaky or my face sticky, it didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I live in CO, and it doesn&#x27;t get too hot here. (Maybe 100 on a bad day.) I wore this in 80 degree weather and my make-up still melted off all the same. I was really excited for this. Unfortunately, it just doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype. I&#x27;ve now used it multiple times and with no change, retiring it.</li>
    <li> Used this for my wedding. It worked well and kept my makeup in place for an outdoor wedding in Kansas in August! I have very sensitive skin and was a little scared of a breakout from this product but it is very gentle. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I personally did not notice a difference when using this product. The major downsides that I found is that 1. It doesn&#x27;t mist, it is like a jet stream out and 2. It doesn&#x27;t not smell the greatest. I only bring the smell up because it&#x27;s on your face so you have to smell it until you take it off.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much. I use t for photo shoots and it reallu does help keep makeup in place. The smell is amazing.</li>
    <li> dries on my face with spots showing</li>
    <li> Bought this and the shipping was amazing in a few days I had my product.Tried it out last night for the first time and loved it.Keeped my makeup on no messing up or nothing.Defenitely worth the price,wait,and cant wait to try more products from this brand.</li>
    <li> My favorite makeup setting spray- the sensitive skin formula is the best.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Really works on keeping makeup on all day. Still a strong scent, so if sensitive to that, beware.</li>
    <li> The product worked ok...nothing really all that special about it really.  The pray nozzle sucks, big tme!!!!!! It streams out. I opted to pray on a sponge and pat it on the actress I was working on.  It was a little embarrassing -_-</li>
    <li> The product took a very long time to get to my door but I was still very excited when I got it, however I am utterly disappointed with this model in a bottle spray. It does not spray evenly on my face and once it dries it leaves cracked flakey patches on my skin making my foundation look horrible! I would not recommend it to someone else. I&#x27;m sticking with my Urban Decay de-slick setting spray. It works wonders.</li>
    <li> The only reason I am giving this product a 1 star rating is because I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s that great. I didn&#x27;t find it comfortable to wear or long lasting, maybe it&#x27;s just my weird skin but this product is heavy and sticky (stayed sticky all day long), doesn&#x27;t stay matte and smears easily. I would not suggest this product to anyone, as I&#x27;m still searching for a good matte makeup setting spray that works, this one most definitely does not.</li>
    <li> This left weird dried product marks on my face, will not be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product at all. The scent is a horrible cheap perfume smell and it didn&#x27;t lightly mist over my face just splattered. I don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Works wonderfully. Bought this before and the sensitive version is fantastic. Very prompt delivery too</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It has a gorgeous scent. It makes sure you makeup stays in place without irritating te skin. I always buy this setting spray because it works amazing but most importantly it has an amazing price :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. It really works. I perform under hot lights that melt my makeup but this keeps everything in place!</li>
    <li> Words great!! Used this product a few times and it works great! Weird smell at first but still good thing!</li>
    <li> I love this and I used it on every special occasion that I know am gonna sweat and my make up still look the same..</li>
    <li> I purchased this after a few makeup artists recommended it. It smells refreshing. As far as setting my makeup it didn&#x27;t hold my makeup well at all. However, if you have dry skin this would probably work for you.</li>
    <li> Very soothing and light fresh scent!  I feel that my makeup stays on! Would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This stuff is magical!!!  I bought some before going to hot and humid (yet beautiful) Florida and used it every day there and not once did my make-up melt off.  That was the true test for me!!  Love this stuff.  Just bought some for my daughter now and will continue to use it myself!!</li>
    <li> Ever wished you could put your makeup on and not worry about it melting in the heat of the night as you dance till dawn?  How about your wedding where you&#x27;ll have your picture taken for HOURS?  Like to look good while working out but worried your makeup will smear and look disgusting?  This is the product for you!  I have used this product for about 2 years ( an aestatician told me the secret!) and the product is simply amazing.  I&#x27;ve received compliments and some very envious comments about my makeup always looking like I just put it on.  I always tell the secret....its Model in a Bottle!</li>
    <li> I work in a restaurant and the kitchen gets HOT. Like over 100 degrees. With that, and running around a dining room all night, I tend to get sweaty, and my makeup melts off my face. This stuff really cuts down on that. It keeps my foundation and blush in place through a busy 8 hour shift of constant movement. My eye makeup stays pretty well, but after maybe 4 hours, my mascara and eyeliner do start to fade or run, giving me black smudges under my eyes. That&#x27;s the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars. Maybe if I use waterproof mascara and eyeliner it will stay better. But hey, 4 hours is better than nothing! And on slower days when I&#x27;m not constantly running around sweating, all my makeup does stay in place. I love that it&#x27;s for sensitive skin, too, because I am break-out prone and this does not clog pores. I would recommend it to pretty much anyone, especially if your job isn&#x27;t as physically strenuous as mine. If you work in an office, this would probably be perfect at keeping your face looking flawless!</li>
    <li> I love this. I never used a setting spray and decided to try this not thinking it would work but It really does. My makeup looks so fresh and like I just did it 8 hrs later. I will always buy.</li>
    <li> I just received the product in the mail and when I opened the box there was a strong smell. When I opened the product from the package the bottle was DEFECTIVE! When I was about to file a replacement I was not allowed to. My bottle was leaking already! What a waste of a product. I WAS excited for this product. However, now I am disappointed for the quality of my bottle.</li>
    <li> I bought this item hoping it would keep my makeup on all day for an outdoor wedding that was in the Texas hill Country which tends to be very hot and humid at times. However I felt that it kind of made my face oilier than usual even though it did keep my makeup on</li>
    <li> No to sure yet... A few more try&#x27;s..</li>
    <li> I still have my bottle full... It doesnt spray right..</li>
    <li> I normally use Urban Decay makeup setting sprays and thought I would try something a little less expensive with a familiar brand name. I&#x27;m not happy with the scent of this spray or how the nozzle distributes the spray. I feel like I&#x27;m being rained on rather than spritzed.</li>
    <li> I heard about this product from a photographer friend who sprays it on brides&#x27; faces to protect their make-up during the day for photo shoots. I tried it because it is for sensitive skin and I have very oily skin that requires attention all day. Guess what? It works! It feels like liquid drops of hairspray -- so that is a little odd. Don&#x27;t breath for 30 seconds and make sure your mascara is dry. Then it dissapears like magic and sort of glues your makeup on to dry perfection without a trace. Once in a while I have to blot my face and respray during the day but it works like magic and even helps my skin stay clear by preventing oily build-up during the day. I&#x27;m a believer and going in for my repeat purchaser status.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!!! I have oily and acne prone skin.  My make-up has always smudged off after only an hour or two of wear.  I had pretty much given up on finding a setting spray that actually works.  Then I discoverd this and my world has changed!  My make-up now lasts 10+ hours!  I really wouldn&#x27;t have believed it unless I witnessed it with my own eyes.  I am blown away with this product.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the smell.  It has a very strong lavander scent but luckily it fades once the spray dries.  Other than that I have no complaints about this product.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this has a slight burning sensation  when I first used it.  I got use to it, but I probably will not order this again.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I never wear make up without it. It keeps my make up looking fresh all day. If you wear make up, you need this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad bottle or what but when I went to spray this, I did a test spray first to make sure I had product up the nozzle then I sprayed it at my face and all it did was splatter huge drops instead of a fine mist. Absolutely no mist spray at all just the big splattering drops that were 2mm all over my face from just one spray. It was like getting flicked with water. I already threw my packaging away or else I would return this in a heartbeat. Very disappointed. It stung too when the drops hit my face.</li>
    <li> I saw people on YouTube raving about this so I decided to give it a go! I was so excited because I live in southern California and it can get really hot over here. I was tired of my makeup melting off so fast! The first time I tried it, it literally felt like I was spraying hairspray on my face. But I&#x27;ve heard people call it hairspray for your face. So I thought to myself that I guess they were being literal when saying that. Lol! But here is when it gets bad! I was out and about and I scratched an itch on my face. My makeup literally balled up! I was mortified because it was very noticeable! So the day went by, and my makeup kept on flaking off! I thought, did I not shake it well enough? Maybe it&#x27;s having a bad reaction with the foundation I was wearing? I gave it a fighting chance and tried it a few more times because I really wanted to like it! But no such luck. Was I doing something wrong? Has anybody else had this reaction with this product???</li>
    <li> I had purchased this product on a whim because I leave for Disney World within the next week and needed something to set my makeup against the crazy humidity. I was appealed by the sensitive skin because rarely do I find a product that doesn&#x27;t redden my skin or blow it up like a balloon. I received it promptly and on a 14 hour day of work I decided to try it out, wow. I was absolutely impressed at how well my makeup held after the day. Besides the smell (only lasts a few seconds) this product is amazing and something I will most definitely keep in my must haves!</li>
    <li> the pray leaves uneven pray pattern and visible shiny spitmarks on the face. also was furious i could not return it, since it is &amp;#34;hazardous material&amp;#34;. it is somewhat ironic , that make up that goes on your face is hazardous enough to be refused s return!&lt;br /&gt;BTW alcohol content is very high in this product indeed.</li>
    <li> Ive used maybe half a bottle--the sensitive one.  I feel my makeup looks better longer and the shiny areas of my face don&#x27;t get as shiny.  It feels like nothing is on.  dries quickly.  sprays a very fine mist.  Am working on my own homemade formula to save some money though--is a bit pricey for the amount.  per ingredient list is mostly alcohol</li>
    <li> Only one thing to compare this to. Lavender scented  hairspray on your face.</li>
    <li> Works...but for a &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; spray it sure does have a slight sting and an unpleasant smell (which does go away pretty much right away)</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to using and loving this makeup setting spray, but unfortunately it left my makeup with small clumps! Maybe the product was old, not sure. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product but am disappointed in the results.  I have very oily skin and have difficulty staying matte.  This sprays very blotchy spraying from arms length which is as far as I can go.  When on my skin it is visible where the drops have landed and does not absorb into my skin even after waiting minutes and is very sticky!  I have gently blended the product into my skin to help it.  Most importantly this does not help shine at all.  I noticed no difference in my skin using this.</li>
    <li> This product was amazing.  It absorbed in my skin quickly and kept my makeup on. I will make sure to purchase again.</li>
    <li> I heard and read such great things about this product and I&#x27;m so upset it did not work. I have a NYX setting spray and this model in a bottle works just as bad but I paid more for this.... It does nothing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely great to use. I would recommend it to people.  But sometimes I feel like you can see the spray on my face...other than that it&#x27;s weight less and holds all day.</li>
    <li> Works okay but it does not come in the same bottle as the picture! I wish I could return it but there is no option for this item kind of disappointed.</li>
    <li> I saw this used by a makeup artist from Glamour Magazine in a youtube video and thought I would give it a try since I had an outdoor wedding coming up in the summer.  In a dry heat this was fantastic!  The trick is to lightly spray from top of forehead to nose, chin to nose and then side to side for even coverage.  I have rosacea and my skin is bright red under my makeup.  This product kept my foundation and eyeshadow from creasing or melting in the heat and no redness showed through.  My skin is also incredibly sensitive but this does not increase the redness or cause breakouts.  I can tell you it worked for me and I am now using it daily- at least during the summer.  I did receive the bottle pictured so I don&#x27;t know if the bad reviews were actually for this product.  I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Made my makeup Cakey and blotchy</li>
    <li> I recieved the product in a different bottle, not pictured in the review. Pretty upset because I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s genuine, plus it made me break out like no other. I&#x27;m not sure if I really recieved what I paid for.</li>
    <li> I first heard about this while watching a you tube tutorial.  This is my second bottle that I have ordered and will be using forever.  I really hope they do not discontinue this product because it is a staple in my daily routine.  I am a business traveler and have many occasions that I need to leave in the early morning hours, hop a plane, rent a car, go to a venue and train all day.  By using this product I look as fresh walking into training as when I left my home that morning.  Keeps make up in place and is so light you have no idea you are wearing it.  Also prevents that dreaded late in the day oily look.</li>
    <li> I bought it cuz my Make up always fade though I don&#x27;t use heavy one!! Only a CC cream and a setting powder. The product made my face look plasticy which I don&#x27;t mind, but the spray dots were all over my face appearing !! Don&#x27;t forget to tell about the smell. It smell soOoooooo chemical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes its made for sensitive skin cuz I did not have any reaction :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I don&#x27;t recomend it</li>
    <li> First time I have tried a make up setting spray. Was skeptical whether it would actually work or not but it does! My make up stays in place all day. Will definitely be reordering this product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t hold my makeup in place at all. The only reason I even gave one star is because it had a nice scent.</li>
    <li> works ok, not sure it makes a huge difference on me</li>
    <li> I have read so many reviews on this make up setter so I decided to order both the sensitive and the original spray.  I was so disappointed when I finally got to try it. The mist made my mascara run to my under eye area (annoying).  My makeup did not last longer like this \\&quot;Magic Potion\\&quot; claims, it was no different than any other day.  The only reason I did not give this a 1 star is because I have not used it very many times. Since this item cannot be Returned and I am stuck with 2 bottles of it, I am going to try to start using it more often and if after a while for some \\&quot;MAGICAL\\&quot; reason this starts working and keeping my make up on for long periods of time, I will REVISE this review. For now.. it is what it is.. this sucks!</li>
    <li> The spray is uneven and not a fine mist at all. Makes application very difficult. I would not use this on clients because it&#x27;s like getting sprayed in the face with a water bottle. I don&#x27;t know if I got a defective bottle or what. However, it does do the job. My makeup stays in place but it has a tacky/sticky finish. I&#x27;ll be going back to Urban Decay setting spray.</li>
    <li> it smells good, but it didn&#x27;t  make any difference with my make up, good or bad.....save your money and skip it.</li>
    <li> This is ok.  My problem is it makes my makeup slightly sticky.  But I can stand that because it also makes it stay on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard many good things about Model in a Bottle and when I found out they had a Sensitive Skin product, I took the bait and bought it. From the very first time I used it, I was disappointed. However, I kept using this spray for over a week, hoping it would change my mind. Unfortunately, it did not. The spray comes out of the bottle not in a fine mist like I&#x27;d hoped, but fairly heavy. It burned my skin as soon as it hit my face. The smell was very chemically strong and burned my nose, eyes, and lungs. The skin burning and smell finally subsided after a couple minutes, but I could still smell the product on my skin all day. I would NOT recommend this to anyone who is sensitive in any way, be it sensitive skin, sensitivity to smells, or any one with breathing problems. I gave it 2 stars because it does actually help prolong makeup wear, but the disadvantages way outweighed the advantages for me. I will never buy this product again.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff! Just make sure to cover your hair when you are spraying your face or your hair will be very sticky.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really liking this product.  It allows my make up to last hours longer.  I&#x27;m very oily so usually after a few hours my foundation starts to wear off.  But this product helps it last longer.  It does contain Alcohol, so I try to avoid spraying under my eyes since it may be too drying and cause wrinkles. It does sting when I first put it on. So keep eyes closed. And avoid spraying on hair.  Otherwise, once it dries it can cause flaking in the hair (like hairspray does). I&#x27;m not sure if this product would be good for dry complexions. It may be too drying with the alcohol.  Instead dry complexions can just use 100% aloe vera. Which is wonderful for any skin type and a natural primer for makeup.</li>
    <li> I did my daughter-in-law&#x27;s bridal makeup for her on her wedding day and used this to set it.  Her makeup stayed flawless throughout the before photo sessions, the ceremony, the after photo session and the entire reception.  If you have a special event and you want your makeup to look just as pretty at the end of the night as it did at the beginning, then this stuff is worth every penny.  And the bottle will last you a long time.  It only takes a couple of sprays to set your full face.</li>
    <li> Product works well, I would have given it 5 stars. But I wish it came out as more of a mist, instead of a stream.</li>
    <li> I live in the most humid climates on earth. This is the only stuff that keeps my makeup in place.</li>
    <li> Excellent product,  great seller, great experience!</li>
    <li> I would give this 0 stars if possible. I read all the reviews about this product and have heard it&#x27;s amazing so I bought it. I used this one time on my skin and it felt like I put hairspray all over my face. Other setting sprays I have tried, urban decay, nyx, have never felt like this. My face felt sticky and so uncomfortable. This spray also came spraying out staright rather than a light mist so my face had big splotches of this product. Save your money on this product and spend the extra money to get a better setting spray!</li>
    <li> This product did work for me and my daughter. I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> PERFECT setting spray! Literally allows makeup to last, looking flawless all day/night. I have super sensitive skin and it usually breaks out with most sprays/lotions. This product is truly amazing. Hasn&#x27;t caused any reaction and really holds things in place. I highly recommend it !</li>
    <li> today is the first day that i use this product and so far i love it!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;My make up stayed on my face all day.</li>
</ol>
