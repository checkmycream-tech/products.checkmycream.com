      <li>I got the delivery quickly.  </li>
      <li>Good product - a little think in the winter months - does not spread that easily as opposed to when it is warmer.  </li>

      <li>This was my first try at using a mineral/physical sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>bought it because it does not contain oxybenzone, or retinyl palmitate and because it is largely zinc</li>
      <li>Not irritating to my tender face.</li>
      <li>This went straight into the trash and</li>

<li> which didn&#x27;t happen with the Neutrogena dry touch)</li>
<li> This is my first venture into physical sunblocks and I am not impressed.</li>
<li> They felt very dry, even after washing and applying a lotion.  </li>
<li> the itching and redness has subsided, but I have little bumps on parts of my arm and neck, actually, my neck still itches a bit.  </li>
<li> My mom and I used this while hanging out at the beach - never got wet,</li>
<li> I expected that after reading reviews of sunscreens with titanium and zinc.  </li>
<li> It was kinda thick and left a slight white cast, on my arms and chest/neck.  </li>
<li> At the end of the day I took a shower, and noticed a few little red bumps on my arm.  </li>
<li> Consumer rating review had this caution, &amp;#34;Products that contain the active ingredients titanium dioxide and zinc oxide may contain nanoparticles.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, it burns and swells your eyes like crazy and it does not do a good job of protecting from sunburn.  </li>
<li> I found this one to be difficult to spread--it&#x27;s also very tacky when applied, and I found that my hands felt strangely sticky for a few hours after application.</li>
<li> It is so incredibly hard to rub in and leaves my already white face looking like a sheet.</li>
<li> Many reviewers discuss how annoying it is to apply this sunscreen, which I agree with.</li>
<li> While labeled as unscented, it does have a slight oat and plastic smell.</li>
<li> So our child walks around in looking slightly face-painted.</li>
<li> Also I felt it had less protection then others that I tried.</li>
<li> The 7th Gen goes on easier but it leaves a little shine on your face.</li>
<li> We used this all summer on Mom, Dad, and 2 little girls, plus friends as-needed.  </li>
<li> but I really disliked how my hands/palms felt after applying the product.  </li>
<li> This product was difficult to rub into the skin and then it left a subtle white film on the skin.  </li>
<li> It looked very odd.  </li>
<li> What if this had been put on a baby or small child???  </li>
<li> However, as with other less-toxic sunblocks, it&#x27;s very hard to blend in.</li>
<li> The bottle of sun lotion I previously used was purchased 2 years ago with expiration date late in 2015!  </li>
<li> The unscented product is almost devoid of smell, but still smells faintly of...well, plain lotion.</li>
<li> with any zinc product, it is thick and hard to rub in.</li>
<li> It does not go on smoothly and feels awful on my skin.  </li>
<li> This sunscreen lays way too thick on the skin</li>
<li> So thick and did not rub in well, it seems they have issue with consistency.</li>
<li> The lotion is too thick.</li>
<li> The instructions say to reapply after perspiring, which would mean (in my case, anyway) reapplying almost continuously.</li>
<li> Not a great on-the-go sunscreen.</li>
<li> I took a shower, and it seemed difficult to remove the sunscreen.  </li>
<li> It is a sad product.</li>
<li> Other reviewers didn&#x27;t like the smell, but I think they are awfully picky.</li>
<li> I did not get any bad reactions on my arms and legs though.  </li>
<li> I am just disappointed to get something that will expire so soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> The lotion is too thick.</li>
    <li> I try to stay away from too many chemicals so it is nice to find a sun screen I feel safe putting on my self and my child.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen lays way too thick on the skin but I could have lived with this if the product would have worked. While wearing this sunscreen and following the instructions through I developed a wicked sunburn on my shoulders.</li>
    <li> I like that this is free of all sorts of toxic junk, as the EWG database shows. However, as with other less-toxic sunblocks, it&#x27;s very hard to blend in. So our child walks around in looking slightly face-painted.</li>
    <li> If you want good sunscreen that isnt gross on your skin, doesn&#x27;t smell bad AT ALL and actually WORKS - then buy this product! It has a really good rating on the EWG&#x27;s Sunscreen report.  Skin cancer runs in my family, so knowing what i can about sunscreen is really important, and spending money on a product that is good for me and actually works is also REALLY important!</li>
    <li> I got the delivery quickly.  The expiration date is May 2014.  The lotion either has been on the shelf for a long time or it has a very short shelf live.  I think it&#x27;s the former.  I live in New York, summer is over in this region.  I bought the lotion because I ran out and needed to replenish.  The bottle of sun lotion I previously used was purchased 2 years ago with expiration date late in 2015!  I am just disappointed to get something that will expire so soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sun lotion, although it&#x27;s for children and/or people with sensitive skin.  My facial skin is still too sensitive for it.  I did not get any bad reactions on my arms and legs though.  So, I am still on the hunt for a good SPF sun lotion suitable for very sensitive facial skin.</li>
    <li> I thought other people were exaggerating, but they&#x27;re right, this product stinks.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it because it does not contain oxybenzone, or retinyl palmitate and because it is largely zinc based.&lt;br /&gt;As with any zinc product, it is thick and hard to rub in. However, because it is more natural than the dangerous ingredients listed above, I don&#x27;t mind the &amp;#34;hard to rub in&amp;#34; ghostly whiteness: After all, sun cream protection is not for your looks. It&#x27;s so you don&#x27;t get freaking skin cancer, people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this both on my son and on me. The smell lingers a long time, especially if you put it on your face. I&#x27;m thinking about ordering the scented version and seeing if there is a noticable difference.</li>
    <li> It goes on smoothly and has no harmful chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that Aubrey uses natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Most of the companies use chemicals.</li>
    <li> This product was difficult to rub into the skin and then it left a subtle white film on the skin.  It looked very odd.  I returned this product for a refund and would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of this sunscreen.  It does not go on smoothly and feels awful on my skin.  Also I felt it had less protection then others that I tried. All in all I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Works well sun blocking with adequate zinc with out being too white and washes off easily. Not irritating to my tender face. love the unscented.</li>
    <li> Good product - a little think in the winter months - does not spread that easily as opposed to when it is warmer.  Also a bit drying to my skin - hoping that wont be a factor when the humidity strikes here in the south.  I blend it with another product for a more moisturizing feel.  Finding a good natural moisturizer with SPF is a tough battle.</li>
    <li> This was my first try at using a mineral/physical sunscreen.  I&#x27;ve been using a spray-on chemical sunscreen with no problems, except that I don&#x27;t like how it makes me all shiny and feel greasy.  I got the Aubrey sunscreen at my local healthfood store.  It was kinda thick and left a slight white cast, on my arms and chest/neck.  I expected that after reading reviews of sunscreens with titanium and zinc.  Day one:  okay, but I really disliked how my hands/palms felt after applying the product.  They felt very dry, even after washing and applying a lotion.  At the end of the day I took a shower, and noticed a few little red bumps on my arm.  I applied some cortisone cream.  Day two:  I put on some disposable gloves (yes! &#x27;cause I want this to work!) and applied the product to my arms/ shoulders/ chest and neck.  By the end of the day, my right arm had a lot of little red bumps and itched, so did my neck.  I took a shower, and it seemed difficult to remove the sunscreen.  I put on some cortisone cream.  Day three:  the itching and redness has subsided, but I have little bumps on parts of my arm and neck, actually, my neck still itches a bit.  I&#x27;ve never considered myself to have &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34;, so I&#x27;m really surprised to get this kind of reaction.  I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m reacting to, either.  Could it be the titanium or the zinc?  Boo!  It&#x27;s supposed to be better than using chemicals.  I&#x27;ll be returning the product to the store, and trying some Neutrogena sunscreen, for now.  I may try another brand of physical sunscreen in the future.  Maybe just zinc, no titanium.  If anybody has some idea what could be causing this reaction, or alternative sunscreen suggestions, please let me know.</li>
    <li> excellent price.  Consumer rating review had this caution, &amp;#34;Products that contain the active ingredients titanium dioxide and zinc oxide may contain nanoparticles. These compounds have been linked to reproductive and developmental effects in animals.&amp;#34;  this product has those ingredients.</li>
    <li> It is not harmful to the skin, (organic), it stays on  &amp; my husband likes it , too. He is outside for his work &amp; constantly uses sunscreen. It causes no problems for his sensitive skin, yet protects him from the strong skin damaging rays of the sun.</li>
    <li> Many reviewers discuss how annoying it is to apply this sunscreen, which I agree with. However, I think the hassle is well worth knowing that my sunscreen doesn&#x27;t include harmful ingredients.</li>
    <li> This is my first venture into physical sunblocks and I am not impressed. It is so incredibly hard to rub in and leaves my already white face looking like a sheet. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> i love the lack of harmful chemicals&lt;br /&gt;in this product. i think it still breaks&lt;br /&gt;my face out. would recommend.</li>
    <li> While labeled as unscented, it does have a slight oat and plastic smell. I&#x27;m not fond of it, but I can see how some people enjoy it. The consistency is pretty thick, and takes work to evenly spread onto skin. It also leaves my skin noticeably whitened, even after thoroughly applying it and having it on for an hour. I will use it until it is gone, but I will not be buying more.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to give a lower spf sunscreen a try on my fair-skinned daughter.  She tans fine, and does not burn easily, but we have always used spf 50.  We are happy with the quality of this product, but I just cannot say it totally compares to ThinkBaby.  It was a little greasy (not bad, and definitely usable.)  In a pinch, I would for sure buy it again.  But, we will likely stick to ThinkBaby and ThinkSport.  This one did not seem to last as long, or work quite as well.  (My husband and I use ThinkSport, which is also spf 30 - and compared it to this one.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, do not be discouraged from giving it a try.  Great ingredients, which is SUPER important!</li>
    <li> Not greasy at all. What a godsend for skin allergy sufferers!</li>
    <li> Was runny and ineffective</li>
    <li> So thick and did not rub in well, it seems they have issue with consistency.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the product. Nice switch from Neutrogena products with avobenzone. Other reviewers didn&#x27;t like the smell, but I think they are awfully picky. The unscented product is almost devoid of smell, but still smells faintly of...well, plain lotion. It also disappears shortly after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a runner and I don&#x27;t find that this product stings my eyes much when I exercise, which is a big improvement over the Neutrogena and Walgreen&#x27;s products I used to use. I&#x27;m not saying you should put a glob in your eye, but it&#x27;s far better than other products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do notice that this product has a white tinge to it, so you look a bit paler than normal (which didn&#x27;t happen with the Neutrogena dry touch) but I don&#x27;t mind that.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I read it was one of the top 5 \\&quot;most healthy\\&quot; sunblocks available.  Unfortunately, it burns and swells your eyes like crazy and it does not do a good job of protecting from sunburn.  It is a sad product.</li>
    <li> What I am looking for in a sunscreen: safe/nontoxic, unscented, and effective. This sunscreen meets the criteria for safety (according to the EWG Skin Deep Cosmetics Database), and is unscented. The problem I have with it is that it is quite oily and causes my face to sweat. Once I&#x27;m out in the sun, I feel like I&#x27;ve been basted. The instructions say to reapply after perspiring, which would mean (in my case, anyway) reapplying almost continuously. This really negates any benefits from the sunscreen! Will continue to search for a sunscreen that is equally nontoxic, but not as oily.</li>
    <li> One of the better all natural sunscreens. I gave it a 4 only because it seemed much harder to rub in than some of the other natural brands I have.</li>
    <li> My mom and I used this while hanging out at the beach - never got wet, no sweating, just sitting on a towel.  Reapplied to higher-risk areas (nose, shoulders, etc) just to be safe after an hour of sun exposure.  The result?  We BOTH got sunburned!!  The areas that had one application and two applications both got noticeably burned.  What if this had been put on a baby or small child???  This went straight into the trash and the hunt for effective natural sunscreens continues.</li>
    <li> I found this one to be difficult to spread--it&#x27;s also very tacky when applied, and I found that my hands felt strangely sticky for a few hours after application. Not a great on-the-go sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I researched dozens of sunscreens since I live in Hawaii and my kids play lots of sports.  I bought this and 7th Generation Baby Sunscreen, SPF 30 and I like this one best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is truly unscented.  The 7th Generation has a light citrus scent which is not unpleasant, but I don&#x27;t like having to get used to a smell on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave a ghost mask on my kids&#x27; faces.  After rubbing in, your face looks clean and normal.  The 7th Gen goes on easier but it leaves a little shine on your face.</li>
    <li> We used this all summer on Mom, Dad, and 2 little girls, plus friends as-needed.  Applies easily for an organic sunscreen, easy to rub all the way in.  Kids don&#x27;t mind it, and despite our fair skin, no one burned this summer, even though we weren&#x27;t fully vigilant about reapplying.  Good stuff!</li>
