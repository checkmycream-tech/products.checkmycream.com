<ol>
      <li>so I know perfectly well how this is supposed to smell.</li>
      <li>Great deal!  </li>
      <li>great price, great scent.</li>
      <li>Great</li>
      <li>The soap has a great scent.  </li>
      <li>each, great bar of soap.</li>
      <li>All in all a great product.</li>
      <li>He is happy to use it.  </li>
      <li>If they could improve these two things it&#x27;d be great.</li>
      <li>Great smelling soap and my son loves it.</li>
      <li>Smells good.</li>
      <li>I guess anything that gets you noticed is good advertising.  </li>
      <li>Like others said it has a very unique shape perfect for holding and doesn&#x27;t fall apart like most bar soaps.</li>
      <li>I gifted this to someone in my household and they smell great</li>
      <li>:) Will purchase again!</li>
      <li>It smells amazing.</li>
      <li>Got this as a stocking stuffer for the family guys are Christmas and everyone really liked it.</li>
      <li>kind of annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>To be honest, its not my favorite scent</li>
      <li>May not be suitable for face wash</li>
      <li>It has a great cologne scent that makes you feel and smell fresh.</li>
      <li>The gel is more strongly scented, however, and I wish the bar soap could smell as good.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll drop the soap for sure, and that is saying something in the man world.</li>
      <li>My lady likes me more now.</li>
      <li>If you love the deodorant, you&#x27;re gonna love the soap.</li>
      <li>This six pack of bar soap with the same fragrance is a perfect solution.  </li>
      <li>The Dove Mens body soaps are way better than this stuff.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love the swagger anti-antiperspirant but not soap.  </li>
      <li>This fragrance is very clean and lasts on my body all day.</li>
      <li>The old spice swagger bar soap is a great soap to use.</li>
      <li>The scent was not as strong as I had hoped, but it is a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; scent and is just fine.  </li>
      <li>The scent is fine, but the soap doesn&#x27;t rinse well.</li>
      <li>If you are a real man and use cologne I would recommend the James Bond stuff, compliments this nicely.</li>
      <li>Worth the price, if you want bar soap, but the body washes are better.</li>
      <li>IT IS VERY FRESH.</li>
      <li>The scent of this soap is very fresh.</li>
      <li>this difficulty was non-existent thanks to the top curved edges smoothing out from use.  </li>
      <li>This is quickly overcome and I found by the 5th or 6th time</li>
      <li>I LIKE THE SMILE OF THIS BAR SOAP.</li>
      <li>I love Old Spice&#x27;s liquid soaps like their AFTER HOURS shower gel.  </li>
      <li>Smells nice, but moderate lather</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like the scent at first</li>
      <li>Its like trying to lather up with a Hot Wheels car.</li>
      <li>And we save all the expense of buying very many bottles of watered down</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m a new user to old spice, love the deodorants and decided to try the soap.</li>
      <li>It is mostly flat on the bottom and curved on top</li>
      <li>The price is right and it is Old Spice, so it is worth it.  </li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>I refuse to buy body washes, because they contain too much non-recyclable packaging and water.  </li>
      <li>It has a generic and cheap fragrance you&#x27;d expect from an off-brand soap.</li>
      <li>Smells up the whole house when he&#x27;s taking a shower.</li>
      <li>Old spice got it right with the soap idea</li>
      <li>The soap is just as strong and the smell lingers long after you shower.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is not as good as its Old Spice Swagger bodywash counterpart, and doesn&#x27;t last as long either.</li>
      <li>Their TV marketing spin was &amp;#34;Imperial leather rests on its name&amp;#34; bemoaning the fact that people leave the bar label-up because its such a pretty label.</li>
      <li>If you focus on wearing out those sections first, you can manipulate its shape into a regular bar...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice Swagger deodorant for well over a year as well as their body wash</li>
      <li>My son likes Old Spice swagger body wash.  </li>
      <li>The shape of the soap is not the normal curved bar, it is has two bubbled out sections on the bottom like a back massager or something.</li>
      <li>If you lather your washcloth by broad strokes across your washcloth and not by rotating on the horizontal axis I would assume you wouldn&#x27;t have this issue.  </li>
      <li>I purchased a 6 pack of Old Spice Red Zone Swagger bar soap.</li>
      <li>However I find that it&#x27;s starting to dry out my skin a bit, just my chest really.</li>
      <li>I thought these would have the same complex, masculine aroma, but instead they just smelled sickly sweet.  </li>
      <li>Personally, I prefer Imperial Leather bar soap, an old English brand.  </li>
      <li>... Dollar off coupoun, fast delivery, Six bars for less than .50</li>

    <li> You&#x27;ll drop the soap for sure, and that is saying something in the man world. Its like trying to lather up with a Hot Wheels car. The shape of the soap is not the normal curved bar, it is has two bubbled out sections on the bottom like a back massager or something. If you focus on wearing out those sections first, you can manipulate its shape into a regular bar... kind of annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not as good as its Old Spice Swagger bodywash counterpart, and doesn&#x27;t last as long either. Tons of compliments when I use the body wash.. that literally does last 8 hours after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have to go with bar soap, I would recommend the Dove Men+Care \\&quot;Aqua Impact\\&quot; bar soap. Similar smell, regular soap bar shape.</li>
    <li> If you love the deodorant, you&#x27;re gonna love the soap. The soap is just as strong and the smell lingers long after you shower. :) Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Medium quality.  May not be suitable for face wash</li>
    <li> Smells nice, but moderate lather</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m a new user to old spice, love the deodorants and decided to try the soap. Like others said it has a very unique shape perfect for holding and doesn&#x27;t fall apart like most bar soaps. However I find that it&#x27;s starting to dry out my skin a bit, just my chest really. In addition I think it&#x27;s irritating my nipple, crazy itchy, but nothing serious like an infection. If they could improve these two things it&#x27;d be great. For now I&#x27;ll just use moisturizer until I finish the rest of the soap. No need to waste it.</li>
    <li> Simply god like in all aspects. Fully ascends all expectations and keeps me smelling like a boss all day everyday. If you are a real man and use cologne I would recommend the James Bond stuff, compliments this nicely.</li>
    <li> The scent of this soap is very fresh. I also purchased the swagger body spray. This fragrance is very clean and lasts on my body all day.</li>
    <li> It smells amazing. But if used for more than one shower a day your skin starts to dry out pretty badly. I don&#x27;t use lotion or anything but I&#x27;m sure if you do you may not even notice.</li>
    <li> The scent is fine, but the soap doesn&#x27;t rinse well. I&#x27;m just going to stick to body wash.</li>
    <li> I love the swagger anti-antiperspirant but not soap.  These dried out and cracked within one week of use.  Left my skin feeling very dry.  The Dove Mens body soaps are way better than this stuff.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THE SMILE OF THIS BAR SOAP. IT IS VERY FRESH.</li>
    <li> I prefer the bar soap to the shower gel. The gel is more strongly scented, however, and I wish the bar soap could smell as good.</li>
    <li> I love Old Spice&#x27;s liquid soaps like their AFTER HOURS shower gel.  I thought these would have the same complex, masculine aroma, but instead they just smelled sickly sweet.  Not something you want to rub all over your body.  I can&#x27;t recommend these; I gave them away to someone who wanted them for a soap project.</li>
    <li> Great... Dollar off coupoun, fast delivery, Six bars for less than .50 each, great bar of soap.</li>
    <li> I gifted this to someone in my household and they smell great and it seems to be lasting as  well as any other soap.</li>
    <li> Great smelling soap and my son loves it. Smells up the whole house when he&#x27;s taking a shower. He loves the lather.</li>
    <li> To be honest, its not my favorite scent but it has lasting power.</li>
    <li> The old spice swagger bar soap is a great soap to use. It has a great cologne scent that makes you feel and smell fresh. I would recommend this soap to others.</li>
    <li> My son likes Old Spice swagger body wash.  I refuse to buy body washes, because they contain too much non-recyclable packaging and water.  This six pack of bar soap with the same fragrance is a perfect solution.  It works the same, smells the same.  He is happy to use it.  And we save all the expense of buying very many bottles of watered down soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One curious thing, is the paper wrap around the bar says &amp;#34;soap on a rope without the rope&amp;#34; in two different languages.  I guess anything that gets you noticed is good advertising.  Personally, I prefer Imperial Leather bar soap, an old English brand.  It has a metallic label on each bar which works as a platform to keep your counters soap-free as the bar gets thinner.  Their TV marketing spin was &amp;#34;Imperial leather rests on its name&amp;#34; bemoaning the fact that people leave the bar label-up because its such a pretty label.</li>
    <li> Old spice got it right with the soap idea</li>
    <li> great price, great scent. Got this as a stocking stuffer for the family guys are Christmas and everyone really liked it.</li>

    <li> The soap has a great scent.  I didn&#x27;t like the scent at first but it has definitely grown on me.  The shape of the bar makes it awkward to lather up your washcloth initially.  It is mostly flat on the bottom and curved on top this makes rotating it on the horizontal axis difficult.  This is quickly overcome and I found by the 5th or 6th time this difficulty was non-existent thanks to the top curved edges smoothing out from use.

    <li> Love it. Smells good. My lady likes me more now. haha</li>
    <li> I purchased a 6 pack of Old Spice Red Zone Swagger bar soap. I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice Swagger deodorant for well over a year as well as their body wash so I know perfectly well how this is supposed to smell. This bar soap doesn&#x27;t smell at all like the deodorant or the body wash. It has a generic and cheap fragrance you&#x27;d expect from an off-brand soap.</li>
