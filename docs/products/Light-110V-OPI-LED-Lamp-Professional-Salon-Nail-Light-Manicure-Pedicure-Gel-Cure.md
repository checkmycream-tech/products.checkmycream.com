    <li> No issues, works great :)</li>
    <li> Just as described in product description.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my friend who got her nail tech license, so was looking for a larger LED lamp than the one she has, she told me she is super happy with it and that it does that job great.</li>
    <li> Every good for use . Thanh you</li>
    <li> This thing payed for itself after 3 gel manicures. Can&#x27;t go wrong with DIY rather than paying salon prices. What used to cost me $35 plus tip in the salon now costs me NOTHING!! Great investment if you love getting manicures but have crippling student loans, etc. like myself.</li>
    <li> I bought a cheaper light at first and sent it back the next day. This OPI LED Lamp is so awesome and the same one the salon I went to uses. It&#x27;s worth the higher cost and I love being able to do my nails at home at my convenience. You will not be disappointed with this awesome gel polish cure light.</li>
    <li> It arrived sooner than I expected it to.&lt;br /&gt;Also works great just as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Cuts the time in have than my other curing light.</li>
    <li> Seriously, just buy a 60- 100w led light bulb, plug it into any lamp in your home, and just hold your finger or hand close to the lit bulb for a minute. It works! I have a professional uv lamp but when I&#x27;m just repairing one or two nails and don&#x27;t want to be bothered with pulling that out, I use the household lamp method. So cheap, I feel like an idiot for buying the salon lamp in the first place!</li>
    <li> This light is unreal. I can feel the heat as it cures and my gel is HARD after its done. FIrst time I have ever don&#x27;t gels and they actually stayed past a week and didn&#x27;t start separating from my nail! This is the same light that my previous nail tech used, and now I know why. SO worth the money.</li>
    <li> This lamp does not work well with gel polish . I was very dissappointed after I bought it , cause it said that it works very good with any gel polish and supposed to dry in 30 sec , I cured it for maximum minutes but the polish it&#x27;s still sticky .</li>
    <li> its usable and i no longer have trouble with the gel not curing properly. smudgy and smears have been reduced by alot. alot faster than using the uv light to cure gel too.</li>
    <li> My wife asked for one of these lights.  We researched a number of different makes/models and obviously settled on this one.  It seems ruggedly built and like it will last.  She seems happy with it and if she&#x27;s happy...  Well, you know...  :-)</li>
    <li> Well worth the initial investment!!! It is easy to use and reduces the manicure time in half when comparing it to my other UV lamp. Love this product!</li>
    <li> This product works as promised; it is fast and efficient.  It enables me to have a salon like manicure at home.</li>
    <li> This is what they use in the nail salon I used to go to and I didn&#x27;t know that a non professional could  buy it as well; thanks to amazon. I have known how well it performs but got the opportunity to rate it now. It dries the nail gel in a twinkle of an eye and this is because it is an LED which safe to use without the harmful rays. The best part is that I am now doing my nail at home, which means a lot of savings.</li>
    <li> I bought almost a year now. And light it seen no longer work as before. ( less bright) . So anyway that I can fix or change the light inside ?</li>
    <li> TAKES A FEW MINUTES FOR EACH HAND AND IT COOKS COLOR VERY WELL.  I HAVE BOUGHT THE CHEAPER UV LIGHTS AND BIG MISTAKE THEY DONT WORK AS WELL.. THIS IS DEFINATLEY WORTH THE MONEY</li>
    <li> AS descripted works great.  Enough heat to dry shellac polish.  Better then cheaper Creative brand.  Would highly recommended to anyone.  Little expensive.</li>
    <li> The person for whom I purchased this item for really loves it especially when she is doing the gel nails. She sets the timer and the timer is activated by the customers fingers,  Thus all the customer has to do is move their fingers and the timer resets..Since it is her own light she does not have to search for a &amp;#34;curing light&amp;#34; when she needs one. Also there is no light bulb to replace.</li>
    <li> This is the best LED lamp I&#x27;ve owned. A little pricey but so worth it!</li>
    <li> Great product-----Great Amazon service!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product.. Highly recommend. The sleek, modern design is a plus.. Cures gel polish 3 times faster than uv light.. Love this product from OPI</li>
    <li> Works like a dream come true.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I have had other Manicure lamps.

    <li> Sturdy unit with multiple times available.  The mini-shelf for your thumb is a nice feature since you don&#x27;t need to twist!</li>
    <li> love this machine. I cannot say enough about it!  it does the job EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.  I don&#x27;t really see the need to set it for 45 seconds because l use it on 30 all the time and it dries them perfectly. I will say that the metal prongs you pull out to raise it up so ur feet can fit under it-- came off the first day. they won&#x27;t stay on. so I have to prop it up on books now for my toes.</li>
    <li> as described, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Love it! Worth the money.</li>
