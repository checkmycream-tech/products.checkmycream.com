<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> All good except the cost of the product has gone up. :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  It&#x27;s gentle and non-irritating, and it works!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years and so nice to get it delivered to my home.</li>
    <li> Love the product!! Have used it for&lt;br /&gt;many years</li>
    <li> Good cream - love it.  however,  ordered one jar -shipped from Paris, France and had to pay about $28 for shipping.</li>
    <li> Hard to get out of bubble package.  Cream is good, but its too difficult to deal with the hard sealed package.</li>
    <li> My mom introduced me to this product. I LOVE this moisturizer, so much so that I ordered one for my daughter. It smooths your skin and I actually have seen a visible difference on my skin&#x27;s appearance. Not oily and smells nice too. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Perfect for your woman!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for the last 5+ years, and have always regretted it if I ever discontinue its use. I just turned 50 and the only two times I did not get compliments about my &amp;#34;still good skin&amp;#34; were when I had not been able to use the cream regularly. My family lives abroad and every time I visit (annually) I get asked what I do to have such smooth skin. This cream hydrates and moisturizes my skin like no other, smooths out fine lines, evens out my tone, and I have never been bothered with any breakouts, or irritation. I have sensitive and very dry skin, so I think a lot before I put something on it. For what you get from it, the value for the price is unbelievable. I used to buy it from Costco. In December, I was going abroad for a whole month and put off purchasing a new jar till too long. Alas, Costco stopped selling it, &amp; I had no time to get it until almost a month later. I can actually post my pictures to show the difference between my skin mid-November &amp; mid-January. I ordered it and started reusing it 2 days ago, and my husband, (who never notices such things), said my skin looked &amp;#34;good&amp;#34;. :) In the meanwhile I tried 3 different brands, one of them really expensive, and they don&#x27;t even come close. I put off posting reviews until long, but the change I see in my skin in just 2 days of use prompted me to post this right now! There is no better cream for this price on the market!</li>
    <li> My wife loves it and it helps with some of her deep blemishes and wrinkles. She is acquiring more of their product suggest that you do the same.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Can&#x27;t say enough about it, I have bought 3 more elizabeth Arden face products since this one because it worked so well. I have always had acne here and there and so I use acne face wash and pads. But none of it worked that well. This Elizabeth Arden face cream I started using and within one week I saw a difference in my face. No more acne, and my skin looks overall healthier and smoother and feels great. I would recommend this product to anyone! Seems expensive at first until you see how long the cream Will last you and how well it works.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I start noticing a difference in just one week. I don&#x27;t ever want to go without it. Thank you for supplying this for such a great price.</li>
    <li> good but not as moisturizing as I expected</li>
    <li> This is the only face cream I can wear due to my sensitive skin.  It never irritates my skin, even my eye area!  I try others when I run out, and I always come back to this.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t remember how many years I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer but it&#x27;s been a long time. I have very sensitive skin and this is the only moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. It feels very silky on your skin and does a great job of moisturizing. Love it.</li>
    <li> great price and quality.&lt;br /&gt;I cant even buy this for that at wholesale.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks. I like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;Cynthia</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product and has used it before.</li>
    <li> This is a fresher product and cheaper than what you can find at the mall/stores!</li>
    <li> Visible Difference is one of my favorite &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34;  beauty products. Goes on like silk and your skin drinks it in. Not greasy. Makes your skin luminous and super soft.</li>
    <li> Everything was just perfect, thanks for a great buy!</li>
    <li> Can say more than I love it and have used it for years.  Gently perfumed and sinks into your skin beautifully.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream longer than I can remember and believe it is the reason I get many compliments from people who know my age and remark on the condition of my skin.  I had never used this supplier and was pleased with the price and free shipping.  Everything arrived on time and in good condition.  There was no outside wrapping on the individual boxes and I intend to check this out the next time I&#x27;m in a department store to see if the boxes usually come wrapped.  Everything looks, smells, and feels all right but all my other Elizabeth Arden products have an outer wrapping</li>
    <li> Was not happy about the small jars..only 2.5 oz....I got the 3.4 oz jars before for the same price,,!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years because it goes on rich and melts into light and natural moisture.</li>
    <li> Revisited after many years can&#x27;t remember why I stopped using it but so pleased to have found it again as my skin has never been so good and friends keep commenting on how good my skin looks</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the BEST face cream on the market...bar none! I used to be able to get it at Costco but they discontinued carrying it. Consequently, this is the best price I have found and even better, it comes with free shipping. Truly a well named product...it does make a visible difference!</li>
    <li> Very please to have found this product on line, I have used this for years and wanted to continue but found it to expensive at the stores. Good buy on line.</li>
    <li> Although the box looked new, the cream inside is very old. Can&#x27;t use it. That&#x27;s why it was so cheap.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my sister who has been using this product for about 5 yrs.</li>
    <li> The product good. Price its OK. But you can find it cheaper at COSTCO, plus an additional product. My wife is happy and that&#x27;s w3hat it counts. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and will continue doing so.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is great, and it is not expensive.  I have very dry skin and this is the only moisturizer that does the trick.  After trying the expensive creams, I&#x27;ll stick with my Elizabeth Arden!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and expected the texture to be more creamy.  What I have feels &amp;#34;dried out&amp;#34; and does not feel as moisturizing as goes on my face</li>
    <li> Actually I have been using this product for over twenty years and the consistency is not the same anymore. It is think and rubbery and I will call them on this. This product has been a constant joy to use in the past, I would like to continue with this product, if they so not change what already works.</li>
    <li> Mother loves this product</li>
    <li> My wife really likes this product, and so do I!!</li>
    <li> Have used this for many years.  Glad to be able to order it</li>
    <li> It makes me feel good and I don&#x27;t have to worry about allergy.  I bought it at Costco before ,but they don&#x27;t sale anymore. I am so happy I can get from your place, and same price as Costco.</li>
    <li> Twice the quantity at half the price of the smaller jar at Macy&#x27;s...go figure. It can be shipped from UK to Western US and still sell for a pittance compared to department store prices.</li>
    <li> I panicked when Costco stopped selling this product. I received my order about 2 weeks after I placed it through Amazon. This product has brought so many compliments. After 30 days I saw a difference. After 60 days, my friends and coworkers started telling me I looked different. A great product that lives up to it&#x27;s claim!</li>
    <li> moisturized my skin very well.i have very sensitive skin and this cream not causing my skin allergy reactions. i used this cream&lt;br /&gt;under my sun cream every day.</li>
    <li> Love this moisture cream.  Previously purchased at Costco and they discontinued, so was happy to get it at Amazon.  Good price, as well.</li>
    <li> Excellent product at  about half the price of retail department stores. Also, speedy delivery~~~even though it came from ENGLAND! Good Job!</li>
    <li> I have oily skin, yet, I do get dry patches on occasion. The last thing I want to do is add any oily shine to my face. This is the best cream ever for me. Lasts a long time and does a great job treating the dry areas without adding the oily shine that so many creams create. Doesn&#x27;t block pores and even works well under makeup.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. First got it at Duty Free and liked it enough to re-order. Paying a bit more for the thick fancy glass jar I&#x27;ll bet.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and it really keeps my skin soft.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer! My face feels smooth.&lt;br /&gt;but I got this from costco about 3 wks ago for $16.</li>
    <li> Makes a really good night cream.  Absorbs in and doesn&#x27;t stay greasy all night.  Have used it for years and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait a little while before gushing over this product.  My sister turned me on to Elizabeth Arden when I was 30ish and I didn&#x27;t use it.  I should have but it was too expensive for me at the time so I didn&#x27;t even try it.  How dumb was that!  She did get me to use cream daily from a early age which she said was the smartest way to keep your face looking young.  When I retired a few years back I quit doing my daily (ready for work) face which included that daily application of cream.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t done that as I can see there are consequences.  I remembered her bragging about how good Elizabeth Arden was so I decided to give her cream a try as nothing else was doing it.  Not only is it available on Amazon but it was only $24.  I ordered some and by mistake my husband threw it in the dumpster.  You should of seen him going out in 8 degree weather dumpster diving.  Evidently someone else found it earlier in the day.  I ordered another bottle and now I&#x27;m writing about good it is,  It took almost 2 weeks for me to see a difference but it&#x27;s there and its a good difference.  No it doesn&#x27;t keep your face from sagging but it gives it a healthier glow and helps moisturize your skin.  I had two places on my face that showed my age and they are beginning to fade away.  That alone has made my day.  I&#x27;m going to buy another bottle now if it&#x27;s still on sale because I know a good thing when I see it.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product from perfume world.its fake.looks different, smells different and giving me pimples.I never expected this from amazon .com</li>
    <li> It provides the moisture that my skin needs. I only use  it during fall and winter when, my skin is most dry.  I have less breakouts with this and my skin remains supple and hydrated.</li>
    <li> Love this cream.  It&#x27;s all I use (night and day) and I love what my skin looks like.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this. I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 years and it&#x27;s definitely improved my face better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I certainly highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast service.</li>
    <li> THE Absolute Best!!  Need only very little.  Non greedy. Non sticky. Facial skin like a baby&#x27;s ass on no time. And I&#x27;m 67. Mom was &amp;#34;a lifer&amp;#34;  of these products and friends who hadn&#x27;t seen her in 50 yrs raved about her still beautiful skin.. When she passed 2 weeks ago @97</li>
    <li> Love this product. Iv used it since I was 38 yrs old. Im 70 now. and buy it regardless of age. Amazon has a good price.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for an older person with dry skin.... She loved it!</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with all the items I purchased</li>
    <li> Good price .i love it</li>
    <li> Product as promised and great delivery.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer, the price is great. I previously bought this at a national whole sale club but they no longer carry it. This price is almost as good as theirs was - and my aging skin is doing very well with Elizabeth Arden.</li>
    <li> My wife has used this product for 10-15 years. This jar has a different color and consistency than normal. It also has a second label over an original label on the bottom of the jar.</li>
    <li> you can feel the difference...you don&#x27;t need alot.  a little goes a long way.  I get it all the time for my mom.&lt;br /&gt;she&#x27;s 82, but you&#x27;d never know it.  of course that&#x27;s mostly genes, but this helps alot.</li>
    <li> This cream goes on so smooth! It softens my skin and has gotten rid of the redness &amp; dry area I have on the sides of my nose. 10/10 would buy again.</li>
    <li> The cream was hard packed into jar, not at all creamy as the product should be, useable but I would certainly not recommend this sellers product</li>
    <li> This product has been my only moisturizer since I was 20 yrs. old.  I&#x27;m now 70 and because I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles most people guess my much younger than my chronological age.  It allows my skin to breathe.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for decades.&lt;br /&gt;Very, very happy with it, for skin care and moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;Does not bother eyes. Seems non allergenic.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream at bedtime for years. When Costco stopped selling it, I tried a couple of others. Now I&#x27;m back, The just purchased jar is the big size, so be sure you look on Amazon for the best buy for 3.4 oz.</li>
    <li> the only one my daughter can use.  very good</li>
    <li> Very great price for what it&#x27;s really worth! Love this cream. Makes my face smell and feel amazing. My boyfriend lives using it too! Perfect for dry or sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> It is something I can use that doesn&#x27;t cause and allergic reaction and is very soothing.</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer since the age of 28.  I am now 63 years old and people think I am 43-45 years old. This is not a greasy cream. Ladies don&#x27;t forget to moisturize your neck and chest.( I also  have no wrinkles there.) Great product !</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years, and absolutely swear by it.  It is a light cream, that sinks in well and does not leave a greasy film, just soft skin, while slowly erasing minor skin imperfections over time.  I&#x27;ve even seen it reduce or completely remove brown sun/age spots over the course of several months use.&lt;br /&gt;This is a product I fully intend to continue to use.</li>
    <li> My skin suffers horribly in the winter.  It&#x27;s so hard to find something heavy enough to moisturize but not too heavy that it clogs pores.  This is awesome.  The scent can be overwhelming though, smells too herbal, or powdery.  The third ingredient is Squalane (look it up) vs. Dimethicone like in so many other night creams.  It&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
    <li> I have used the product for years and always purchased it at Costco.  They no longer carry it so I was on a search for as near to their price as I could get.  It is much more expensive than this at department stores.  This is the exact same size jar as I used to get and with the exception of the small bottle of perfume that was included in the Costco item it is relatively the same price.  I really like this product and it&#x27;s quality a lot.  I get compliments on my skin quite often and I think the fact that I&#x27;ve been using this for more than 8 years has definitely enhanced my skin&#x27;s appearance.</li>
    <li> I have used this produce for 30 years!  It is an excellent moisturizer, very light and pleasant. I have not found a reason to change to a different product.</li>
    <li> I have used Visible Difference for about 40 years and my complexion is very good.  As long as they make it, I will buy it.</li>
    <li> I have used it for years.  Good price.</li>
    <li> mom liked it very much, should be 5-star if it matches costco price.</li>
    <li> Always the best cream for your face and neck.  I have been using this since I was in mhy 20&#x27;s and am now 67 and my skin looks great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Visible Difference for 15 years or more. The packaging looked right, but there was no little inner cover, my first clue. The smell was unfamiliar and the texture was like Crisco. I don&#x27;t know WHAT this stuff is, but it&#x27;s not Visible Difference!</li>
    <li> It is great, use it every night for many years.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer. I have used it many years,,highly recomended.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream for my mother who has used the cream for years and did not like the one that I purchased for her through Amazon. Her words to me were &amp;#34;it&#x27;s fake&amp;#34; not the same. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have been using your product for a long time and love the results!!!!</li>
    <li> Cream is light yet moisturizing.  Love It.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and have had bad experiences with several skin care products. This is the first that I have found which had no negative side effects and which I have seen a noticeable improvement in my complexion.</li>
    <li> Not the same cream I was used to. Elizabeth would have been upset if she had received it ( Maybe it was past its expiration date ?).</li>
    <li> Very thick cream; much different than orders I&#x27;ve made in the past.  It is hard to apply.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer...and is perfect for applying before using primer.  It smooths out the skin and is never greasy!!!!!!!</li>
