      <li>good product.</li>
      <li>Good Quality Polish.</li>
      <li>The Holographic effect is Awesome when the light hits it on your fingertips.</li>
      <li>and I for sure want some more great nubar colors!</li>
      <li>As a side note, it took FOUR coats before it wasn&#x27;t transparent on its own.  </li>
      <li>Beautiful color, fast drying.</li>
      <li>Very light in color and coverage.</li>
      <li>this is a high quality product, goes on beautifully.  </li>
      <li>Love this polish.  </li>
      <li>I am going to order some more colors.</li>
      <li>I love this color...</li>
      <li>we love it and have used it a couple of times..</li>
      <li>I love to catch the sunlight with my nails after I use this polish.</li>
      <li>i love nubar products.</li>
      <li>When used with a top coat, it lasts for  a week</li>
      <li>I Love the color, the sparkle,</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t even apply a top coat</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this color...</li>
      <li>Dries quickly, looks nice.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a jelly-type polish with microscopic holographic fine glitter.</li>
      <li>It wears fantastic and I get so many compliments.</li>
      <li>All the colors are for sure to catch your eye on something special.</li>
      <li>It turns out, 3 coats is the magic number to get the full holographic depth effect.</li>
      <li>This nail laquer is not such dark as you can see on the picture, but the quality is very good, very charming</li>
      <li>the shine I would definitely recommend it was packaged great .</li>
      <li>and i got light purple instead.</li>
      <li>This polish applies smoothly with a glossy and iridescent finish.  </li>
      <li>On it&#x27;s own (with 2 coats), it&#x27;s a gorgeous light pink color</li>
      <li>this polish is spectacular, it drys quickly so getting the 4 coats I need to make the holo pop was easy and fast.</li>
      <li>but now that I&#x27;ve gone back to it, I would say that it&#x27;s one of my favorite colors of the moment!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed, it just wasn&#x27;t what I thought it was going to be.</li>
      <li>The more layers you add, the more holo and shine you get - especially if you use a top coat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I loved the thickness of this polish, a nice indication of lasting wear, but the depth in color isn&#x27;t as advertised, and that was my main reason for purchase.</li>
      <li>if you don&#x27;t have time for a clear top coat, you can go without!  </li>
      <li>It looks best under sunlight or direct light; so it probably won&#x27;t be noticed too well at the bar or club for you single ladies.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>But in hindsight, I should have paid more attention to the reviews of this product as I never would have ordered it if I had known absolutely that it would be the way it is.  </li>
      <li>, now that I have been outdoors in it, I have to admit that the holographic effect is pretty cool!</li>
      <li>this is OK, the color is not that vibrant, i have other hologram effect nail polishes that are way more holographic and better colors, this one is just ok</li>
      <li>And it was delivered so quickly</li>
      <li>Dries quickly too.</li>
      <li>This collection is highly recommended and a for sure must have.</li>
      <li>When I first bought this polish, I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan...</li>
      <li>but once you do its very pretty.</li>
      <li>nail polish looks good on my nails and lasts long.</li>
      <li>I thought about returning it, but others are right - as a topcoat, it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
      <li>Hard to describe, gorgeous to wear!</li>
      <li>Nubar Brilliant is a gorgeous holographic pink (with tones of green, yellow, and purple depending on how you see it in the light).</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t exactly look exactly like the picture  but its very pretty tho.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it still looked great, but I guess the darker colors have more &amp;#34;depth&amp;#34; to them.</li>
      <li>thank you very much.</li>
      <li>I love this polish and have bought it several times.  </li>
      <li>and it only gets that star because of being okay as a topcoat.  </li>
      <li>I definately want to get more holo&#x27;s in the future</li>
      <li>She applied it without a basecoat or top diamond coating just to try it on and at first it looked dull, so she applied one more coat.</li>
      <li>but my nails grow fast.  </li>
      <li>I really like the way it looks on her.</li>
      <li>and she absolutely loves it, and</li>
      <li>It absolutely looks nothing like this picture at all.  </li>
      <li>However, I really like what it does look like.</li>
      <li>I thought this color was really cool and actually ordered another as well.</li>
      <li>As a top-coat, it gives polish an extra shimmer (super holographic sparkle).  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>The odor is way better than average!</li>
      <li>It ends up more of a pale lavender with a bit of a shimmer.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s one of my new favorites.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s long lasting, doesn&#x27;t damage or stain my nails, and removes easily.</li>
      <li>They are pretty, sheer shades</li>
      <li>It is not super glittery except in the sun light.</li>
      <li>It shows up almost clear.  </li>
      <li>, I was surprised .</li>
      <li>The picture and the description are completely misleading and you can&#x27;t return it.  </li>
      <li>The color is paler than the photo, by far, but in the sun you do get a shimmering of lots of colors.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While it took me 4 coats to build up to an opacity I liked, it wasn&#x27;t overly thick or streaky, which is a definite plus in my book.</li>
      <li>Next time I&#x27;ll spray it with nail quick dry!!  </li>
      <li>has a pretty sparkle, but appears to be just pink.  </li>
      <li>and at least on me once I applied my top coat they were Rock solid and didn&#x27;t chip..</li>
      <li>The holographic effect isn&#x27;t very apparent either.</li>
      <li>Has pink tint but is clear when applied.</li>

<li> The only short coming is that it takes too long to dry.....</li>
<li> color, in comparison to the others I ordered (Absolute and Treasure) was actually the least holographic.</li>

<li> At first I was really not happy with the color</li>
<li> , I can&#x27;t go to the store without coming home with at least one new bottle.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This nail polish goes on beautifully, and when it dries it has an almost microscopic holographic shimmer. Not glitter, a deep holographic shine. In the peach color are overtones of rainbow. Hard to describe, gorgeous to wear! I love to catch the sunlight with my nails after I use this polish.</li>
    <li> i love nubar products. nail polish looks good on my nails and lasts long. the only thing that i didn&#x27;t like about this one is color. on the picture it looks orange and i got light purple instead. i like it but it&#x27;s not what i was expecting to get....</li>
    <li> I love this polish and have bought it several times.  It wears fantastic and I get so many compliments. Dries quickly too.</li>
    <li> Love this polish.  I have over 50 bottles of nail polish, I can&#x27;t go to the store without coming home with at least one new bottle.  So when I say the Nubar nail laquer is great, I know of what I speak.  You can very the color of the base color to change the rainbow effect.  I used two different colors of blue for base, and put two coats of the pink Nubar rainbow glitter over it.  It looks like a sunrise!!  The only short coming is that it takes too long to dry.....it was still tacky after an hour.  Next time I&#x27;ll spray it with nail quick dry!!  And it was delivered so quickly, I was surprised .</li>
    <li> I love this color...it&#x27;s one of my new favorites.  As a top-coat, it gives polish an extra shimmer (super holographic sparkle).  On it&#x27;s own (with 2 coats), it&#x27;s a gorgeous light pink color w/ plenty of holographic shimmer.  It also has plenty of shine, so if you don&#x27;t have time for a clear top coat, you can go without!  When I first bought this polish, I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan...but now that I&#x27;ve gone back to it, I would say that it&#x27;s one of my favorite colors of the moment!!</li>
    <li> I like the colors of the polish. It does take a few coats to get the full color to be dark enough but once you do its very pretty.</li>
    <li> this is a high quality product, goes on beautifully.  but i&#x27;m not sure about the color.  have not seen the \\&quot;holographic\\&quot; tones.  has a pretty sparkle, but appears to be just pink.  will test it in the sunlight and see if other tones how.  very nice transaction, great communication and shipping info from seller.  thank you very much.</li>
    <li> There is nothing Brilliant about this color at all.  It absolutely looks nothing like this picture at all.  I applied 5 layers and just got this nude pink color, thats it.  A serious waste!  What am I going to do with polish thats going to collect dust in my drawer for the next 10 years?</li>
    <li> It shows up almost clear.  Nothing how it looks in the pictures.  Not impressed. I would not recommend this. :(</li>
    <li> I loved the thickness of this polish, a nice indication of lasting wear, but the depth in color isn&#x27;t as advertised, and that was my main reason for purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 different shades of this brand and was very disappointed at how sheer they are. They are pretty, sheer shades but, even after 3 coats, they are not anywhere near as dark or the same color quality as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;Lovely sheer color for the spring and summer though.</li>
    <li> this is OK, the color is not that vibrant, i have other hologram effect nail polishes that are way more holographic and better colors, this one is just ok</li>
    <li> The color is different from what is shown. I was disappointed but not worth returning. Very light in color and coverage.</li>
    <li> This color is slightly shimmery but is one solid color - no holographic color at all. No gold.  No blue as stated in the description.  The picture and the description are completely misleading and you can&#x27;t return it.  Will not buy from this collection again.  Wish I had read the reviews!</li>
    <li> This collection is highly recommended and a for sure must have. So don&#x27;t wait around until there gone. All the colors are for sure to catch your eye on something special. I can&#x27;t wait for my other colors to come!</li>
    <li> The color is not nearly as deep nor as multifaceted as the picture. However, I really like what it does look like. It ends up more of a pale lavender with a bit of a shimmer. The odor is way better than average! It is holding up well under wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, now that I have been outdoors in it, I have to admit that the holographic effect is pretty cool! You have to see it in sunshine. The color is paler than the photo, by far, but in the sun you do get a shimmering of lots of colors. I like that it is free of those usual nasty chemicals too.</li>
    <li> I thought this color was really cool and actually ordered another as well. Like them both front shorter finger nails.</li>
    <li> good product. works great.</li>
    <li> SO disappointed in this - not even in the same ballpark as the photo!  :(  In fact, I had to look up the name of the polish here on Amazon because I didn&#x27;t even recognize the color as one I would have ordered!  I thought about returning it, but others are right - as a topcoat, it&#x27;s not bad.  But in hindsight, I should have paid more attention to the reviews of this product as I never would have ordered it if I had known absolutely that it would be the way it is.  As a side note, it took FOUR coats before it wasn&#x27;t transparent on its own.  BTW, even with FOUR coats, or even as a topcoat, I NEVER saw any \\&quot;rainbow holographic\\&quot; or any holographic effects at all.  Severely disappointed - rating this 1 star...and it only gets that star because of being okay as a topcoat.  Misleading, to say the least.</li>
    <li> This nail laquer is not such dark as you can see on the picture, but the quality is very good, very charming and I like it.I am going to order some more colors.</li>
    <li> Not at all like it is advertised...very dissapointed!  The polish is watery and lacks any of the holographic features that seem to be present in the picture of the product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my girlfriend and she absolutely loves it, and I really like the way it looks on her. She applied it without a basecoat or top diamond coating just to try it on and at first it looked dull, so she applied one more coat. It turns out, 3 coats is the magic number to get the full holographic depth effect. It looks best under sunlight or direct light; so it probably won&#x27;t be noticed too well at the bar or club for you single ladies.&lt;br /&gt;This color, in comparison to the others I ordered (Absolute and Treasure) was actually the least holographic. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it still looked great, but I guess the darker colors have more &amp;#34;depth&amp;#34; to them.</li>
    <li> This nail polish has some of the neatest colors out there.  When used with a top coat, it lasts for  a week but my nails grow fast.  I would highly recommend it.  I have it in several colors.</li>
    <li> Not as durable as some polishes but above average.  The color is very nice. It is not super glittery except in the sun light.</li>
    <li> This polish applies smoothly with a glossy and iridescent finish.  So far I&#x27;ve applied only one coat (over a base color coat) and it&#x27;s not quite as variegated as the photo in the ad.  I&#x27;ll try another coat.</li>
    <li> this was not the brilliant multi colored polish I was hoping for...very dissappointed. the quality of polish is good but color off..</li>
    <li> This polish looks nothing like the picture. No holo effect whatsoever. Just a very thin pinkish sparkle. The seller-Rock &amp; Glamorize was not willing to exchange or let me return the item and sent one of the worst email replies I have ever received from a company. Incredibly bad customer service.</li>
    <li> It was delivered on time and the color was very beautiful..we love it and have used it a couple of times..you just have to paint it a couple of times to get the darker color..thank you</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this color...it has lasted on my toes for almost a month now...and it&#x27;s winter, so shoes and socks have not diminished the look of this polish!</li>
    <li> This polish is beautiful I Love the color, the sparkle, the shine I would definitely recommend it was packaged great .</li>
    <li> Has pink tint but is clear when applied. Need base coat and even then takes tons of coats to get enough sparkle.</li>
    <li> The actual polish looks nothing that what you would expect from the photo. I was expecting something opaque with a ton of holographic effect. It&#x27;s more of a jelly-type polish with microscopic holographic fine glitter. At first I was really not happy with the color but then I put an extra coat on and I have to admit, I do like it. It&#x27;s a very nice quality polish. Dries quickly, looks nice. I didn&#x27;t even apply a top coat and it&#x27;s got tons of shine and held up great. I will definitely try this shade over another opaque polish to see how it looks. I&#x27;m not disappointed, it just wasn&#x27;t what I thought it was going to be.</li>
    <li> It is a great product with a great price. I am happy I purchased the product have told my friends</li>
    <li> this polish is spectacular, it drys quickly so getting the 4 coats I need to make the holo pop was easy and fast. and at least on me once I applied my top coat they were Rock solid and didn&#x27;t chip.. I only took off the polish so I could change my color!!! I definately want to get more holo&#x27;s in the future and I for sure want some more great nubar colors!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a big fan of Nubar colors. Nubar Brilliant is a gorgeous holographic pink (with tones of green, yellow, and purple depending on how you see it in the light). The more layers you add, the more holo and shine you get - especially if you use a top coat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it took me 4 coats to build up to an opacity I liked, it wasn&#x27;t overly thick or streaky, which is a definite plus in my book. I&#x27;ve also used it with one coat to add a holographic effect to my regular polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s long lasting, doesn&#x27;t damage or stain my nails, and removes easily.</li>
    <li> The color looks like a dull purple, not like the pink that is pictured. The holographic effect isn&#x27;t very apparent either. I am very disappointed!!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t exactly look exactly like the picture  but its very pretty tho. Can&#x27;t wait to give myself a manicure and use it</li>
    <li> Beautiful color, fast drying.</li>
    <li> Good Quality Polish. The Holographic effect is Awesome when the light hits it on your fingertips. My clients LOVE IT!!!</li>
