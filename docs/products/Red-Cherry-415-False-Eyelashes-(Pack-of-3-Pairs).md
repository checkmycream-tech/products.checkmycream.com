      <li>but these are my absolute favorite!</li>
      <li>They maintain they&#x27;re shape and are so easy to clean.</li>
      <li>So light and airy.</li>
      <li>I was really excited for these lashes to come in for my prom.</li>
      <li>The self-adhesive is not too strong so I would get extra eyelash glue, but overall these are great!</li>
      <li>I would recommend these to anyone who is going to a special event or just on a date.</li>
      <li>but they are very pretty and can&#x27;t wait to buy some for myself</li>
      <li>Natural look  and very light</li>
      <li>The lash is soft and blends with my real lash nicely.</li>
      <li>They look natural, I love them.</li>
      <li>I wore it on Valentine&#x27;s day and love how natural they looked.</li>
      <li>Despite all the trouble, these lashes were great at really making my eyes pop in photos.</li>
      <li>they look amazing on any eye shape, their fluffy and Natural :)&lt;</li>
      <li>They stuck on the whole night!</li>
      <li>but otherwise I love how it looks especially on camera.</li>
      <li>I usually wear a pair for a week, they are that good of quality.</li>
      <li>After I cut them to my length and width, they hold up very well.</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t really give a review</li>
      <li>and I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I used my new onedollar eyelash glue with it and it stayed on all night.</li>
      <li>I have cut them to look very natural.</li>
      <li>Those were perfect, these were a little too dramatic for a formal evening wedding.</li>
      <li>They were very high quality, but next time I will buy a shorter length.</li>
      <li>At first I didn&#x27;t like the lashes because I thought it was too dramatic for me, but after using it a few times it&#x27;s really comfortable and easy to work with.</li>
      <li>Make them small snips..to see them better put them over a white pc of paper.</li>
      <li>I ordered this after looking at the reviews and although they are very pretty, the lashes were a little too long.</li>
      <li>These are very dramatic, not for everyday but fun for more formal events or for date night.</li>

<li> These are very dramatic, not for everyday but fun for more formal events or for date night.</li>
<li> After a couple tries I learned that it was better to apply these lashes so that they curve &amp;#34;outward&amp;#34; instead of vertically and looking way too dramatic.</li>
<li> I hear ppl say, Oh they are too long...</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used other lashes from Red Cherry</li>
<li> Only thing that bothered me was the band felt a bit stiff</li>
<li> They look natural but give a total dramatic look.</li>
<li> Take a small pr of shears and using only the tip cut into the ends of the lashes.</li>
<li> They are both long and thick.</li>
<li> The curse of the lash base fits my eyes pretty well.</li>
<li> I knew that they were considered &amp;#34;long,&amp;#34; but the length was CRAZY long for me, the lashes were up to my eyebrows!</li>
<li> so it was a bit uncomfortable</li>

    <li> Excellent lashes and super fast delivery. Thank:)</li>
    <li> I love these lashes. I usually wear a pair for a week, they are that good of quality.</li>
    <li> I love them! Fast shipping and great price!</li>
    <li> These eyelashes are great! I loved them! The glue that I wore with them also were greaat! They stuck on the whole night! I even fell asleep with them on, and in the morning not even the edges were peeling off!</li>
    <li> I Love these Lashes! they look amazing on any eye shape, their fluffy and Natural :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;totally recommend these lashes to anyone &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> The best lashes ever.  So light and airy.</li>
    <li> I was really excited for these lashes to come in for my prom. I knew that they were considered &amp;#34;long,&amp;#34; but the length was CRAZY long for me, the lashes were up to my eyebrows! After cutting them with scissors they looked obviously cut and completely unnatural, I was glad that it came with 3 packs of lashes. After a couple tries I learned that it was better to apply these lashes so that they curve &amp;#34;outward&amp;#34; instead of vertically and looking way too dramatic. I also learned that these did not come with their own glue so I had to buy that separately. Despite all the trouble, these lashes were great at really making my eyes pop in photos. They were very high quality, but next time I will buy a shorter length.</li>
    <li> Loved them ! They maintain they&#x27;re shape and are so easy to clean.</li>
    <li> these weren&#x27;t bought for me but as a gift so I can&#x27;t really give a review but they are very pretty and can&#x27;t wait to buy some for myself</li>
    <li> Great product! These are very dramatic, not for everyday but fun for more formal events or for date night. The self-adhesive is not too strong so I would get extra eyelash glue, but overall these are great!</li>
    <li> Great lashes. Very comfortable to wear. Love the quality. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> These are some of the best eyelashes I have come across. After I cut them to my length and width, they hold up very well. I have cut them to look very natural. I hear ppl say, Oh they are too long...well, cut them. Take a small pr of shears and using only the tip cut into the ends of the lashes. Make them small snips..to see them better put them over a white pc of paper. Then you can see what you have cut better and see if you are getting something falling onto the paper. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I saw these on youtube tutorials and decided to get it. I wore it on Valentine&#x27;s day and love how natural they looked. I used my new onedollar eyelash glue with it and it stayed on all night. Only thing that bothered me was the band felt a bit stiff so it was a bit uncomfortable but otherwise I love how it looks especially on camera. Very sexy and I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like the lashes because I thought it was too dramatic for me, but after using it a few times it&#x27;s really comfortable and easy to work with. The curse of the lash base fits my eyes pretty well. The lash is soft and blends with my real lash nicely. Over all I love this lash!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other lashes from Red Cherry but these are my absolute favorite! I used these at prom and they stayed on all night. The quality of these lashes are fantastic! They look natural but give a total dramatic look. They are both long and thick. They feel weightless and as if you aren&#x27;t even wearing lashes. I would recommend these to anyone who is going to a special event or just on a date. They are perfect for any occasion!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this after looking at the reviews and although they are very pretty, the lashes were a little too long. The ends of the lashes were hitting the top of my eyelids! I bought these and another set 747s, for a wedding and after trying these out, decided to go with the 747s. Those were perfect, these were a little too dramatic for a formal evening wedding. These might work from some, but did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Luv these lashes and I am so picky!!! I have tried a couple of them but I seem to come back to these. Natural look  and very light</li>
    <li> Like the picture 100% .. I will order again .. :)</li>
    <li> They look natural, I love them. Add a bit of mascara and Dunzo :)</li>
