      <li>I used the product precisely for two weeks and didn&#x27;t have very good results.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to be able to purchase Proactiv items from Amazon instead of having to join the Proactiv \\&quot;club\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>It arrived exactly as ordered and in excellent shape.  </li>
      <li>:) use it, it does work!</li>
      <li>Proaciv is a highly effective acne treatment brand but, here&#x27;s the catch</li>
      <li>I have the cystic kind of acne(mostly on my chin area), ive had it all my life...</li>
      <li>Nice to not be locked into a monthly payment/agreement and can order what I need when I need it.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive acne prone skin and let me tell you this stuff Works great!  </li>
      <li>but if you put on moisturizer, you should be fine!</li>
      <li>It was very important to me that the order be delivered to him packaged well and on time.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s effective to make the face smooth after using it.</li>
      <li>I AM PLEASED WITH ALL OF THE PRODUCTS RECEIVED.  </li>
      <li>I HOPE THAT I MIGHT BE ABLE TO ORDER THE CHANEL LOTION SOON.</li>
      <li>I used this as soon as I got it ans within a week my skin cleared up and I absolutely love it</li>
      <li>I am so glad I purchased it.</li>
      <li>We are hoping that in another month&#x27;s time we will see even 25% more improvement.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
      <li>I love proactiv.</li>
      <li>Stridex pads worked better for us.  </li>
      <li>I had better results by using that instead.</li>
      <li>I love Proactiv -</li>
      <li>It hasn&#x27;t even been a month of me using Proactiv, but already my face looks better, and feels better.</li>
      <li>it works great and was shipped fast........ will keep buying fom here</li>
      <li>My face felt very clean but it did nothing for my breakouts.</li>
      <li>I loved it at first- until it looked like I had a chemical peel.</li>
      <li>All the hype, but just did not deliver to expectations... as far as myself and my teenager experienced.  </li>
      <li>I have the advanced blemish treatment tube but was extremely pleased with the results from this 4 piece treatment system.</li>
      <li>I received these items very quickly.</li>
      <li>I have been using Proactive for 2 days and already see a huge difference.  </li>
      <li>Works great on my teenage daughter !  </li>
      <li>got free 2 day shipping</li>
      <li>We have tried quite a few products and this one is the best one we can find.</li>
      <li>This is a good product so far as we can tell.</li>
      <li>Easy to use with quick results.  </li>
      <li>so I made sure I followed the directions exactly.</li>
      <li>I wish this 4-pc kit was in the original package</li>
      <li>also tried using the refining mask as spot treatment as many other people recommended that to be the most effective way to use the system.</li>
      <li>During the day I would use their super light moisturizer and did the mask 3 times each week (putting it on all over my face and letting it set for 20 minutes before rinsing).</li>
      <li>i am possitive that if i continue using the full solution that i will have beautiful, clear, and soft skin.</li>
      <li>On the website it says it can take 8 weeks for the product to take full effect.      </li>
      <li>So, folks looking for a quick solution to their problem (i.e. - clearing up your skin in time for prom or a wedding, for example) will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The 2 month supply has been quite worth the money, although he is out of step 1-the</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard a lot of reviews about ProActiv and thought it was worth a try.</li>
      <li>I love how soft my skin feels after use and has been working well under makeup.  </li>
      <li>Better off with the store brand zit clear up washes.</li>
      <li>I find this product completely worth its price</li>
      <li>Clear skin is about more than just using the right brands....</li>
      <li>/&gt;What&#x27;s more, apparently the latest research shows that in severe cases of acne there is bacteria under the skin that must be treated by antibiotics and that treating it superficially isn&#x27;t likely to help much.  </li>
      <li>This stuff really works!</li>
      <li>Started working after the first day of use.  </li>
      <li>If you have a friend who has this product I would try theirs first to see if it works for you before investing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say use this product if you can afford to consistently buy it.</li>
      <li>This is much better than after 3 months of doctor&#x27;s topical cream prescriptions and a tetracycline prescription which did nothing at all to the acne on his cheeks.  </li>
      <li>Thanks again !</li>
      <li>Be aware, there is an expiration date on the product.</li>
      <li>If you have a friend who has this product I would try theirs first to see if it works for you before investing.</li>
      <li>three separate times...thinking it would just magically work eventually) to treat my acne...as well as going to 3 different dermatologists and nothing worked.</li>
      <li>I called at 7pm and got a live person rather quick</li>
      <li>I called at 7pm and got a live person rather quick</li>
      <li>She&#x27;d tried quite a few other cleaning routines but seems to likethisone the best.</li>
      <li>really - you just HAVE to be consistent and give it time.</li>
      <li>I honestly chose to stop using Proactiv, it&#x27;s just not worth the money for me.  </li>
      <li>it is one of the best products that i have used for it, for all the other ones dried my skin or oiled it to much.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll find a better deal right here on Amazon, just search for \\&quot;Super Size Proactiv\\&quot; and you&#x27;ll find it, and get much larger sizes with free shipping (usually).     </li>
      <li>And that is not saying much.</li>
      <li>I really, REALLY like the refining mask.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>but he may have used 2 much of it at times.  </li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t work very well</li>
      <li>It kept my skin for breaking out too much</li>
      <li>I am going to have to pay much closer attention to the size of items order.  </li>
      <li>They advertised the MAX outta  this, and I was expecting a real gem.</li>
      <li>Dries out my face WAY too much.</li>
      <li>I can get rid of the acne very easily.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
      <li>but she want fast results, I tell her beauty do not happen over night</li>
      <li>, was getting more active and talking to a dermatologist.</li>
      <li>But again I could see this working for someone with mild acne but not moderate to intense acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>they don&#x27;t market it with lies like many of the other products do!</li>
      <li>Got this for my son who is a high school freshman and is has a mild to mid case of acne.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend.&lt;br</li>
      <li>then I started using one product at a time and now the complete set works very well for me.</li>
      <li>old son very well</li>
      <li>She is 11 years old and this was really getting to be an issue.  </li>
      <li>Very encouraged by the results thus far.</li>
      <li>I have found a Proactive kiosk in the mall which sells the 2 month system for pretty much the same price, just in case you can&#x27;t wait for the shipping.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Proactiv is GREAT, but this configuration will leave you very disappointed. The sizes are small for the price and you might as well buy the \\&quot;Mega\\&quot; Supersized bottles instead for an additional $10. There is no way that the sizes in this configuration would last for 60 days of use. This ad is misleading.     You&#x27;ll find a better deal right here on Amazon, just search for \\&quot;Super Size Proactiv\\&quot; and you&#x27;ll find it, and get much larger sizes with free shipping (usually).     Conclusion: Proactiv is Recommended! (but buy another configuration).</li>
    <li> Proaciv is a highly effective acne treatment brand but, here&#x27;s the catch - you have to keep at it. Firstly, it takes a few weeks before you see significant results. This is the case for any acne treatment product really - you just HAVE to be consistent and give it time. So, folks looking for a quick solution to their problem (i.e. - clearing up your skin in time for prom or a wedding, for example) will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it is not a magic potion capable of \\&quot;curing\\&quot; acne. Once you stop using the product, your acne will return unless you take active steps to maintain the health of your skin. It is often believed that merely using a product can be the only change made to help your skin. Clear skin is about more than just using the right brands.... having clear skin is about understanding skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say use this product if you can afford to consistently buy it. If you can&#x27;t, understand the ways to help keep your skin healthy since, if you don&#x27;t take those steps, it is HIGHLY likely be disappointed once you stop using Proactiv.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a problem with acne for quite a while. It&#x27;s never been too bad but my skin has never been completely clear either. I&#x27;ve heard a lot of reviews about ProActiv and thought it was worth a try. It worked just like every other face wash I&#x27;ve every used. It kept my skin for breaking out too much but I still broke out. I would just stick with the less expensive stuff then spend over $50 on this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Proactive for 15 year and it never cleared my moderate acne. I had to quit using it because my acne was getting worse and it was over drying my skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this product last week, got it today. The purchase was suppose to include a 2.5 oz mask and it came with a 1oz mask instead. Waste of money!! We&#x27;ll see if they do anything about it...</li>
    <li> I love Proactiv - I&#x27;ve used it for years and it&#x27;s very effective. I don&#x27;t think it is pricy at all compared to other similar products on the market.     It&#x27;s great to be able to purchase Proactiv items from Amazon instead of having to join the Proactiv \\&quot;club\\&quot;. Everything arrived on time and in great shape.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for little over a month now and it seems to be doing a good job.  I am still getting small spots, but they come up quickly, are not half as painful as before, and are gone within a day or two.  On the website it says it can take 8 weeks for the product to take full effect.      Put it this way, once I have finished these bottle I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
    <li> It keeps the acne to a minimum if used as directed. We took pics as he started and are on week 3 and there is some improvement but not like we expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 37 and I&#x27;ve had acne all my life.  I&#x27;d get hopeful and buy these expensive items that claimed to work, only to stop using them because they weren&#x27;t working.  I understand that you need to be patient in the beginning because some will make your condition worse before it clears up.  I&#x27;ve had the problem of picking at my acne and so when things get worse, I&#x27;m a lost cause.  I was pleasantly surprised that my acne cleared up within a month of using Proactive.  I haven&#x27;t had the temptation to pick at my face, and I don&#x27;t have to wear foundation every day to cover them up.  I live in the desert and make-up just melts off my face.  I find this product completely worth its price and I will continue using it as long as I continue to get these results.  Plus my confidence level has gone up.  Yay!</li>
    <li> This is working for my 16 yr. old son very well, thank you Pro Active!</li>
    <li> I have tried about 100 different products (including this one..three separate times...thinking it would just magically work eventually) to treat my acne...as well as going to 3 different dermatologists and nothing worked. I FINALLY found a product that has worked for me and I&#x27;ve been telling everyone about it. My sister has started using it as well and her acne cleared up in less than a week. It was crazy. I wouldn&#x27;t waste you money on anything else before you try what I&#x27;ve been using...plus it&#x27;s way cheaper.    Just copy the link below into your browser and check out their website.  (I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to put a link in here?!?)    [...]</li>
    <li> My teenaged son has had a bad case of acne for more than a year now.  We&#x27;ve tried a variety of different medicines, one of which actually made his acne worse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like nothing we tried worked, so after hearing several friends recommend Proactiv, we decided to take the plunge and buy a 2-month supply, even though it&#x27;s a little expensive.  After using it for several weeks now, we&#x27;ve seen a very slight improvement in our son&#x27;s acne, but nothing major.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We finally got fed up with all of the over the counter stuff and decided to visit our pediatrician.  He told us that our son had 3-4 level acne on the Pillsbury scale which classifies the severity of acne from 1 to 4.  Our doctor said that what&#x27;s in Proactiv isn&#x27;t really that much different than what&#x27;s in most of the other over the counter products.  He also said that the main reason people who used it showed some improvement is because it motivated people to be regular in their acne hygiene routine - something teens are notorious for not being faithful with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s more, apparently the latest research shows that in severe cases of acne there is bacteria under the skin that must be treated by antibiotics and that treating it superficially isn&#x27;t likely to help much.  So now we&#x27;re moving from using Proactiv to using prescription antibiotics and some stronger prescription acne medicines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish us luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a less severe case of acne, then Proactiv might be for you: the main thing is to use it consistently.  But if you have a severe case, it&#x27;s not likely to help very much, and you&#x27;ll probably have to get a prescription for something stronger.</li>
    <li> Bought this since I had tried everything else for my bad skin. I loved it at first- until it looked like I had a chemical peel. The face wash and lotion are great- it&#x27;s the toner that killed my skin. My face turned red like I had a bad sunburn and my skin got really tight. I wish you could just buy the face wash and it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> proactiv helped me ALOT. i used to have a blotchy, red, pimply and full of black heads face. as soon as i got proactiv, skin began to clear up. 1 week later, and i had a few pimples here and there. i am possitive that if i continue using the full solution that i will have beautiful, clear, and soft skin. it is one of the best products that i have used for it, for all the other ones dried my skin or oiled it to much. this is just PERFECTO. :) use it, it does work! they don&#x27;t market it with lies like many of the other products do!</li>
    <li> I received these items very quickly. I was very skeptical because like most people I have tried many products for acne before and they have all worked a little or failed. But I was pleasantly surprised by the third day I had noticed a change in my skin. Its been about a month and I am very pleased with the results. You will HAVE to use it everyday twice a day or you will still see breakouts. Also I prefer the deep cleansing wash for face and body over the cleanser that comes in the set. I had better results by using that instead.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Despite religiously adhering to it including a slow warming up period in the beginning all it did was kind of irritate my skin into a state of raw red horribleness.</li>
    <li> I tried this as a teenager and it didn&#x27;t work very well but thought I&#x27;d try again as an adult but still no results after using it for 3 months.</li>
    <li> All the hype, but just did not deliver to expectations... as far as myself and my teenager experienced.  They advertised the MAX outta  this, and I was expecting a real gem. Was not the case.  Better off with the store brand zit clear up washes. Stridex pads worked better for us.  And that is not saying much.</li>
    <li> Got this for my son who is a high school freshman and is has a mild to mid case of acne.  After two days of using this prodct we noticed a remarkable difference in his face and skin.  This stuff really works!</li>
    <li> She&#x27;d tried quite a few other cleaning routines but seems to likethisone the best. We will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive acne prone skin and let me tell you this stuff Works great!  It definitely cleared my face.</li>
    <li> Great solution for acne problems.  Would recommend for any age. Be aware, there is an expiration date on the product.</li>
    <li> Ordered a set of Proactive for my grandson at Texas A&amp;M University.  Had order sent to him by next day at his apartment.  It arrived exactly as ordered and in excellent shape.  Thank you for excellent service.  Would definitely recommend this site to anyone wanting 100% customer satisfaction !.  It was very important to me that the order be delivered to him packaged well and on time.  It was !  Thanks again !</li>
    <li> Our 11year old daughter, with some pimples, was looking for something that could help reduce her flare ups and promote quicker healing. This product is 4 separate applications some of which come without clear instructions on how and when to apply. In fact, it wasn&#x27;t clear whether or not all 4 were to be used in sequence at all time or even at all. The results for this overly complex process were no better than using an over the counter commercially available product.  Takes too much time with minimal rewards.</li>
    <li> Definitely decreases acne and clears skin. Watch for dryness. I definitely decreased the amount of acne but also bleached my towels.</li>
    <li> After having tried a multitude of acne treatments, creams, cleansers, medications and gels, I have to say that Proactiv actually works. Not only does it eradicate acne, but it create an even skin tone, and after using it for four months already I&#x27;m almost at a point where I don&#x27;t need to wear foundation anymore.  It also does not dry your skin out, unlike many other acne treatments, and I noticed dramatic results in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I tried this product out of desperation. I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s and have had moderate acne since I was a teen and nothing ever really works long term. I really wanted to give this a treatment a solid chance so I made sure I followed the directions exactly. I washed my face twice a day with step one and followed it with step two each time. During the day I would use their super light moisturizer and did the mask 3 times each week (putting it on all over my face and letting it set for 20 minutes before rinsing). I used the product precisely for two weeks and didn&#x27;t have very good results. My small bumps that didn&#x27;t come to a head were minimized so I could see this working for someone with mild acne. I still continued to get new white heads and large red pimples the entire time. My skin was very sensitive during this time but I expected it to be, but hoped it would ease up over time, it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried using the refining mask as spot treatment as many other people recommended that to be the most effective way to use the system. I was not happy with the results with this. I tried putting it on at night as the last step of the system and it would make the white heads larger the next day and the larger red pimples more inflamed. But again I could see this working for someone with mild acne but not moderate to intense acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think their automatic re-ordering is rather shady as there is no way to opt out of the automatic re-ordering when placing your first order. I tried to go in right away to post-pone my re-ordering options and it wouldn&#x27;t allow me to do soon until product was delivered (which they delivered to the wrong address-my billing address-yet they sent to invoice to the shipping address).  I pushed the date back as far as it would go 16 weeks as I didn&#x27;t want them sending me new product right away (it defaulted to 2 weeks from when my initial order was place, but my kit was supposed to last 90 days!). They do not allow you to cancel your account online, you have to call their customer service line. I called at 7pm and got a live person rather quick and I explained my dissatisfaction with the product and that I wanted to cancel the account. She stated she would cancel the account but wouldn&#x27;t give me any sort of cancellation number. I asked if I would receive notice of the cancellation and was told I would be mailed one, but haven&#x27;t received it yet.  My card hasn&#x27;t been charged yet for additional shipments (as I&#x27;ve heard happen to other people) but I&#x27;ll be watching it for the next 16 weeks to see if they try to continue my account. I was also disappointed that I wasn&#x27;t offered any kind of refund or option to send the product back for a partial refund as their ads and web site state they offer this. I&#x27;m out $40 for a 30 day supply (after shipping) which isn&#x27;t awful, but not cheap for something that didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m going back to the dermatologist to try again. So overall I could see this working for mild acne but for people with moderate acne or worse, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it/sign up for their program. If you have a friend who has this product I would try theirs first to see if it works for you before investing., you have to call their customer service line.

    <li> My daughter has become a regular user.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.  I wish this 4-pc kit was in the original package but this is minor. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Well, 6 weeks into using the Proactiv system, we have seen about a 50% improvement in my son&#x27;s skin.  This is much better than after 3 months of doctor&#x27;s topical cream prescriptions and a tetracycline prescription which did nothing at all to the acne on his cheeks.  We are hoping that in another month&#x27;s time we will see even 25% more improvement.  There was so much damage that I think it is just going to take some time to repair the scarring/brown and red marks on the cheeks.  The 2 month supply has been quite worth the money, although he is out of step 1-the Cleanser already...but he may have used 2 much of it at times.  He still has step 2 &amp; 3 which should last another 2-3 weeks.  He will probably continue to use this system for quite sometime.  Just as a side note on purchasing...I have found a Proactive kiosk in the mall which sells the 2 month system for pretty much the same price, just in case you can&#x27;t wait for the shipping.</li>
    <li> My daughter was having terrible acne on her forehead.  I mean TERRIBLE!!  My friend brought her the refining mask and told her to use it as spot treatment overnight.  I was amazed at the results.  Her forehead is totally clear.  She is 11 years old and this was really getting to be an issue.  This is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I gave this a two star...because I like the toner and its ingredients.     Otherwise, I used this and initially it cleared my skin...so I kept using it...then my skin got bad again...so I got into the cycle of using it because of the initial skin clearing and was afraid to stop for fear of it getting even worse. I used it for a long time and then started researching ingredients..there are ingredients that are acne causing in this. So initially the BP and stuff cleared my skin, but then the pore clogging, acne causing ingredients starting causing the acne again. I thought my skin itself was just getting worse, but the proactive was the culprit. Its a vicious cycle.     Well, anyway...I stopped using it and my skin improved, not better just improved. I have the cystic kind of acne(mostly on my chin area), ive had it all my life...I am now 40. I have found something that works well for me now, I dont know if I can name it on here though...It is sold at B&amp;BW, and it is almost a miracle for me...I have dealt with this acne all my life and have found something that almost eliminates it. This stuff, to me, is just a crock.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve ever used Proactiv, this is just like that.  I honestly chose to stop using Proactiv, it&#x27;s just not worth the money for me.  It works well, especially if your acne is the scary kind.  I really, REALLY like the refining mask.  Does some good work.  Never was a fan of the lotion (Step 3), doesn&#x27;t moisturize enough for me.</li>
    <li> Burned my face. Christmas morning I looked like I have been out in the sun for days, face swollen, red, burned</li>
    <li> This is the actual product factory sealed and long expiration date.  Nice to not be locked into a monthly payment/agreement and can order what I need when I need it.</li>
    <li> We got this product for our 17 year old son last year.  He asked for it for XMas 2010.  Not only did we get it for him for XMas, we also purchased it for our 13 year old son.  This is a good product so far as we can tell.</li>
    <li> At first I broke out really bad then I started using one product at a time and now the complete set works very well for me.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all. Not worth wat I paid !</li>
    <li> the first step is a little different than I thought&lt;br /&gt;but still good&lt;br /&gt;hope make me better&lt;br /&gt;good production&lt;br /&gt;got on time</li>
    <li> The product is the same as the discription below the picture. It&#x27;s effective to make the face smooth after using it.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling to get rid of my acne for months now, and at times it would go away but would always come right back. After a week of using this, all my acne started to clear up, yes my face dried out but if you put on moisturizer, you should be fine! It hasn&#x27;t even been a month of me using Proactiv, but already my face looks better, and feels better.</li>
    <li> I love proactiv. I have the advanced blemish treatment tube but was extremely pleased with the results from this 4 piece treatment system. I am so glad I purchased it. I was getting a bit of trouble with acne spots after a very long time since I had a pimple. But saw great results even over a couple of days. Proactiv...you are the best!</li>
    <li> This product did not give me any results for my adult breakouts. My face felt very clean but it did nothing for my breakouts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 36 and still have breakouts.  This is the only thing that works for me.  I wish I&#x27;d found it earlier.  I recommend purchasing online so you won&#x27;t be auto charged and have it ship automatically.  This way you can get it when you need it and it&#x27;s actually a little cheaper.</li>
    <li> Product is great and price was also competitive. It took too long to get it. Will buy it the next time also.</li>
    <li> I have never had acne in my life....until about 2 years ago.  I tried everything, and nothing worked.  I have been using Proactive for 2 days and already see a huge difference.  I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping, however stated that I would receive on March 1st.  Did not receive product until the afternoon of March 2nd.  No big, but when I pay for shipping, I like to have it the day it is scheduled.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t do a thing for my face.  Very unhappy with proactive.</li>
    <li> Dries out my face WAY too much. I had red bumps all over!</li>
    <li> Works great on my teenage daughter !  Easy to use with quick results.  Will order again. Would recommend to others who have teenagers.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why we were so hesitant to try Proactive, but within a week my daughters&#x27; acne improved substantially.  Very encouraged by the results thus far.</li>
    <li> it works great and was shipped fast........ will keep buying fom here you can get a intro price from proactive but its only for your first time buying.</li>
    <li> I think this will work if it is used everyday. My daughter have very bad acne and scars but she want fast results, I tell her beauty do not happen over night it takes time. Well she said she don&#x27;t have time. I wish I could help her cause her acne made her have very low self esteem.</li>
    <li> I am going to have to pay much closer attention to the size of items order.  It&#x27;s my fault, but I was disappointed at the quantity of the product in comparison with the price.</li>
    <li> The Lotion bleaches clothing! I had put some on my shoulder and it bleached my sports bra! I have accidentally gotten some on pants also and it bleached them too! Once I discovered the source I stopped using the lotion altogether. I still use proactive just not the lotion. I buy what I need separately.</li>
    <li> My son use it and it clears his face. But when he got lazy, the pimples come right back. We have tried quite a few products and this one is the best one we can find.</li>
    <li> Proactiv works on my skin. I can get rid of the acne very easily.&lt;br /&gt;Works everytime I buy it.&lt;br /&gt;Its half the price online !!&lt;br /&gt;I got free 2 day shipping so thats great as well.&lt;br /&gt;It came in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I was struggling with acne when I was 15 and 16. I thought I would try this because some of my friends use it and it works for them however they never had acne as bad as I did. I started using it when i was a bout 15 and a half, it helped a little but no major change. I kept using it for a year and it did nothing. I used it just as the directions say, and I even tried talking to one of their sales representatives and they told me it should work but it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;What did work however, was getting more active and talking to a dermatologist. Within a month or so my face was perfectly clear. unless you only have one pimple every few days this is a waste of your time and money. save yourself some money and scars and talk to a dermatologist instead.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years.</li>
    <li> Started working after the first day of use.  I love how soft my skin feels after use and has been working well under makeup.  I would recomend to anyone!</li>
    <li> I AM PLEASED WITH ALL OF THE PRODUCTS RECEIVED.  I HOPE THAT I MIGHT BE ABLE TO ORDER THE CHANEL LOTION SOON.</li>
    <li> I used this as soon as I got it ans within a week my skin cleared up and I absolutely love it</li>
</ol>
