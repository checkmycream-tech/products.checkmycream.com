    <li> Product was just as advertised</li>
    <li> Well made and durable.  Just what I need to match the mask.</li>
    <li> Great transaction. Everything was just perfect!</li>
    <li> This item was a replacement part for a CPAP machine.&lt;br /&gt;It was just as described and was exactly the same as the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a problem with USPS delivery and I thought that the product wouldn&#x27;t be delivered on time at the hotel.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve complained to CPAP Deals and they answered in the same day with some options and instructions.&lt;br /&gt;The item arrived on time at the hotel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say that I&#x27;ve experienced with CPAP Deals, one of the best after sales customer support.&lt;br /&gt;I do encourage companies like CPAP Deals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much, and again sorry for any inconvenience!&lt;br /&gt;Naomi Kawasaki</li>
    <li> The headgear and filters was exactly like the one I got from my doctor! Love that I don&#x27;t have to go through my specialist, pay copay, ECT. And shipped sooner than expected!</li>
    <li> Great replacement, exactly like original.  However, please know that this product DOES NOT include clips.  If your clips are broken, you will need to purchase them separately.</li>
    <li> very happy with the product and it was at a great price.</li>
    <li> Hubby needed a new part for his breathing machine.&lt;br /&gt;He says that this works great and was pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for&lt;br /&gt;Fits my mask perfectly and will buy another when needed. Seems a bit pricey for the material/</li>
    <li> Works like it should  I knew it does not come with clips. Cheaper to buy here than at drs office if deductible isn&#x27;t met for the year.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a new one but, it was so dirty like a used item. I could not use because of the bad smell and spots.</li>
    <li> Fits the original mask very well.  Performs better than the original.  Severely overpriced when you consider the little bit of materila and time that goes into the manufacture.  But, what is the alternative?  They have you by the short hairs.</li>
    <li> exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> Its a genuine Resmed headgear, enough said.</li>
    <li> The cushion doesn&#x27;t seem form enough. This causes air leaks I did tighten it but is uncomfortable having it so tight</li>
    <li> Works as expected. Big improvement now that mask fits correctly again.</li>
    <li> When I noticed that the velcro was no longer adhering on my ResMed mask, it was time to go shopping for a replacement.  Since Amazon seems to carry one of almost everything, that&#x27;s always where I go to find things I need.  Especially when I need it quickly for my quality of sleep and so that my wife doesn&#x27;t pay the penalty of having a leaking/whistling mask keep her awake at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My order came more quickly than I expected and was delivered in an official ResMed sealed package.  It matches the one that I&#x27;m disposing of perfectly.  And of course the price was reasonable--especially for something that I had to have and quickly.  I don&#x27;t know what else you could ask for!</li>

    <li> Great quality and value.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to don</li>
    <li> This fit my husband perfectly, and he&#x27;s got a pretty big bowling ball of a head. It seems a smaller person, like a petite woman would need a smaller one, maybe.</li>
    <li> amazing product .  great quality.&lt;br /&gt; packaged and delivering was perfect.</li>
    <li> The Resmed headgear ordered is exactly what we had originally from the sleep clinic.  The price was less expensive and it arrived very promptly.</li>
