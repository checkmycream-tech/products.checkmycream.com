      <li>I liked the non-greasy feel, and the nice smell.  </li>
      <li>It smells nice, not like sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>Handy size.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find a good moisturizer that can do more than just treat my acne.</li>
      <li>The smell is light but very nice.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very nice smell, sort of fruity and sweet</li>
      <li>But more is better!</li>
      <li>The first time I used the product, it worked great.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s very light and non greasy.</li>

      <li>I love to garden and hike, so I need a product that protects me and doesn&#x27;t come off.  </li>
      <li>I love this for wearing under my make up.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what it is, but I think this lotion sits on top of the skin rather than sinking in and manages to migrate into my eyes every time I use it.</li>
      <li>I love all of Garnier&#x27;s products from skincare to haircare.</li>
      <li>I really love this Garnier skin care product.  </li>

      <li>I love it that it also has sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Love how this smells, very clean.  </li>
      <li>My skin tone has evened out and is soft and beautiful.  </li>

      <li>The first time I applied it, I loved the moisture this gave my face, and it feels silky smooth.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product because I walk in the sun a lot it makes my face really oily, but I still think it is a good product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love it, I have a super very dry sensitive skin, but I do not have any allergy reaction problem with this product, the best part I love of this product is... it&#x27;s high in spf, but very light never have greasy or sticky feeling.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone, it is the best face cream I have ever had, I use it daily, plus it has an anti-sun damage in it. I really love this product and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year now, and I like it better than other moisturizers I have tried in the past.  If you put it on after washing your face (which is when you are supposed to apply moisturizer anyway) it is less greasy than a lot of moisturizers that have spf.  I can say that it I have noticed a great improvement in my complexion.  The only complaint I have about the product is that it tends to make me look pale when I use it because it is not tinted.</li>
    <li> I just started using the Garnier Skincare Skin Renew about 2 weeks ago.  I goes on very well and does make my face feel greasy, nor does it clog my pores, thus far.  I also started using the Garnier Dark Spot Corrector along with this, and I have definitely noticed an improvement in the overall evenness of color on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;m a true believer in Garnier!</li>
    <li> I tried this product. It is expensive for the amount you get. It is way too greasy. Even after hours of waiting upon application.  Coppertone oil free sunscreen spf 45 is lighter than this stuff. As for the benefits, I understand you have to use it daily for 3 months for any. Some say sun damage is irreversible. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> YUCK, if you want a shiny greasy face and larger pores to hold all of the greasy thick lotion, then this is it.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this product and tried it.  (I am always looking for something that can mask the fine lines around my eyes and something with SPF?  Score!)  The first time I used the product, it worked great.  The next day when I used it, I noticed that it burned.  I thought that this would end shortly.  Wrong.  It burned all day!  The next day, when I woke up, both of my eyes were so swollen, I could barely see.  I realize that the eye area is very sensitive, but I guess this product is too heavy for my eyes.</li>
    <li> I picked this up after trying Neutrogena&#x27;s spf 35 oil-free moisturizer, which made my face burn. While Garnier&#x27;s Nutritioniste didn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s much too greasy and chalky, making it impossible to wear makeup over it. I&#x27;ve even tried waiting twenty minutes for it to \\&quot;sink in\\&quot; but it still chunks up once I start to put foundation on. I end up looking like my face is peeling all over and I feel like any spf is lost. Save your money!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell. My skin feels oily and looks shiny for a long time. It does protect my skin from getting burned, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in my skin. The fine lines around my eyes and lips are still there. Update: 6/7/10, I tried this again, but used a lot less. My skin was less oily, not as shiny and the product was absorbed much more quickly.</li>
    <li> I like the way this product works on my face, even only after a couple of weeks. What I didn&#x27;t care for was how the pump on the dispenser does not work at all now. I have tried redistributing the product inside the container, I have cleaned out the pump, but it just does not want to work. If anybody knows how to get this working again, that would be great. But that is my only beef with this product! :D</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a good moisturizer that can do more than just treat my acne. I have sensitive, oily, acne-prone skin. I like to be out in the sun and therefore I have uneven skin tone as well. Here, I thought that I could use this for my moisturizer. I literally just bought it yesterday and have only used it twice. It is far, far too greasy for my skin and makes me look shiny as can be. It looks as if I&#x27;ve worked out for an hour and haven&#x27;t dried off the sweat. It&#x27;s nasty and have wasted money on another product that just can&#x27;t do what I expect it to. That&#x27;s my luck.</li>
    <li> Product is as describes and tastes good.</li>
    <li> Has a fairly neutral smell and definitely not medicinal or &amp;#34;beach-y&amp;#34;.  The small size makes it easy to carry.  The dispenser is efficient and reliable.  It appears to work as a sunblock but I don&#x27;t know if it is any better at that than anything else.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to get rid of dark spots and it is still too soon to tell whether they are fading, but this is an excellent moisturizer.  It is not too greasy or too dry for me.  Also, I didn&#x27;t see any issues with the applicator yet.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product for what it promises -- sun protection, even coverage, lightening spots and so on. And it feels good on my skin. It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy and absorbs well. And the price isn&#x27;t bad either. But after two days I returned it. Day one I noticed it had a strong perfumey smell, but hoped I&#x27;d get used to it. Instead I could smell it all day and I felt like my tongue had gone all powdery (I am sensitive to some highly fragranced products). Day two I&#x27;d hoped I&#x27;d adapt, but it was the same thing -- distracting smell and gulping water like crazy with no relief. So I returned it at the drug store where I&#x27;d purchased it. I&#x27;m disappointed because I really was looking forward to lightening some sun spots and evening out some discolorations but the smell is too strong. Garnier, please cut back on the fragrances! I love your products -- especially your hair styling products -- and those have a strong scent, too, but on the face it&#x27;s too much!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer but does not reduce dark spots. Have been using as a daily moisturizer only.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a moisturizer.  I really don&#x27;t care for the ones with sunscreen in them because they are thick and you can feel them on your skin.  This one has it but it isn&#x27;t that thick.  It smells good too.</li>
    <li> I have to say I really want to like this lotion. I like the fragrance and it feels light. In the very short time I used it I didn&#x27;t notice any greasiness, and I have combination skin. In fact, it didn&#x27;t seem to be enough moisture for my dry areas.    However, the second day of using this my cheeks looked and felt like they had a chemical burn. They felt hot to the touch and had a slight rash. Adding even my mild lotion (Aveeno Posititively Radiant Daily Moisturizer with SPF15) hurt. I may have an allergy to something in it, although I never seemed to have one with other lotions. I personally can&#x27;t use this product.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this moisturizer so I tried it. It smelled good and wasn&#x27;t greasy, but about 12 hours after I put it on, my face broke out in a rash. I thought maybe I was having a reaction to something I ate for dinner, but the next day, it happened again in the exact same places. I stopped using the lotion and the rash hasn&#x27;t come back. I read that this product contains fragrances that may cause irritation, so I guess that&#x27;s it. The friend who recommended it is now getting the bottle.</li>
    <li> third time i&#x27;ve bought this.  great stuff.  smells nice too</li>
    <li> It got rid of my sun spots which I was very happy about! The pump does stop working though. I have gone through two bottles and both stopped working with a good amount left. Have to take pump out and shake it into your hand. Annoying but not a deal breaker. I don&#x27;t find it greasy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a long time! I will continue! A bit pricey though, but goes on smooth.</li>
    <li> I have not noticed any difference on the many brown spots on my hands. I have applied the product many times a day. As I have found in ALL products.....promises promise . but NO results.........Phoebe Lou Roome.......</li>
    <li> I keep buying other, more expensive moisturizers but in the end, this in my go to.  The price is right, I love being able to subscribe and have it delivered automatically as I need it.&lt;br /&gt;It is not oily.  And though it has sunscreen in it, I use it at night.&lt;br /&gt;I recently discovered the Garnier tone corrector serum.  I put that on first then a layer of this moisturizer.  My skin tone has evened out and is soft and beautiful.  I&#x27;m a dabbler in all products but I keep coming back to this one because it performs!</li>
    <li> I live and work on a ranch and so I need something that keeps my face moisturized in the winter with sun block in the summer, isn&#x27;t greasy and smells great and this lotion covers all the bases! I don&#x27;t wear a ton of makeup so I don&#x27;t need to worry about how it works with that. If I have dry patches it takes care of them but is Never greasy. If I&#x27;m outside riding all day in the sun, I don&#x27;t get burned, and did I mention that I love the smell? It&#x27;s NOT over powering at all and I can&#x27;t even smell it once it&#x27;s on. It makes my skin smooth and soft and I love it!</li>
    <li> My skin likes this product, I use it as a moisturizing sun screen.</li>
    <li> This make my skin feel refreshed</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I walk in the sun a lot it makes my face really oily, but I still think it is a good product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading mixed reviews hoping that it would work for me (a 19 year old who frequently goes to tanning beds). Garnier said this was an excellent base for makeup--it is NOT! It is unbelievably oily and leaves your skin so greasy, even after using just a tiny drop, you&#x27;ll still look oily hours later. I debated using it at night, but the smell is really powerful (it&#x27;s not unpleasant, just very strong) and I don&#x27;t want to constantly smell that at night. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for 6+ years now, Folks say I do not look my age. Its a great moistureizer.</li>
    <li> I am always on the look out for a good moisturizer that isn&#x27;t greasy, doesn&#x27;t clog pores, and doesn&#x27;t make my face all shiny. I was using this moisturizer from Garnier without the anti-sun damage, and really, really liked it. When I saw it advertised that they had the moisturizer and it helped prevent and correct sun damage, I figured that this would be an added bonus to an already great moisturizer, and it was! This moisturizer is creamy and rich, but doesn&#x27;t make the skin oily or clog pores. It really helps makeup go on smooth, and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the skin. It has really helped my skin look smoother and help fade my sun spots from former sun damage, while having SPF to prevent new sun damage. The price is a little expensive, but Garnier usually has coupons once a month in our Sunday paper at least, and I always buy this moisturizer on sale. If you are looking for a really good moisturizer that will help the conditioner of your skin without being too expensive or too heavy or oily, this is it. I especially recommend this for people in their 20s who want a moisturizer but maybe not the heavy ones that are targeted for aging skin.</li>
    <li> Ok, I know you aren&#x27;t supposed to EAT it.  But sometimes while rubbing the lotion into your face you do get a little on your lips, and MAN does this stuff taste AWFUL.  It smells awful as well...kind of like the bottle has been sitting around for 40 years kind of smell (even a brand new bottle!).  I do like the skin SPF protection, and it goes on smooth although I am not sure how much actually sinks into my skin and sometimes I just feel like it&#x27;s sitting on top on my skin, not absorbing (and therefore not moisturizing!).  Becuase of this i do notice it looking kind of greasy much earlier on in the day than I had hoped.  I will probably finish out this bottle--maybe---but I will not buy THIS particular product from Garnier again.</li>
    <li> I know that everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so for skin products unfortunately we all end up buying some products we can&#x27;t use. This, however, was the first moisturizer with an SPF that goes on nicely, doesn&#x27;t feel, look, or smell like sunscreen, and most importantly, does NOT give rise to pimples like many other face lotions do for me! I am pleased with it. I would only give it four stars because I assume there are better moisturizers, but for this price, I don&#x27;t think you can beat it.</li>
    <li> Allow to work but is doing the job. No returns.</li>
    <li> The package of Garnier skin renew anti sun damage lotion we received on June 17, 2015, was manufactured in December 2014. Not too bad at 6 months old but not superior since it expires after 3 years.</li>
    <li> I used this product for at least 8-10 months and when it ran out, I didn&#x27;t think about it and just bought another moisturizer. I started using Aveeno tinted moisturizer (which is also very good, but it is not for sun spots). For the past month or so, I have been freaking out because all of my sun spots and freckles are coming back full force and are more pronounced. I didn&#x27;t know why and did not make the connection that my skin had looked so good because I had been using Garnier anti-sun damage spf 28.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went out and bought it last night and used it this morning. I am not kidding, but I noticed a difference in my skin immediately. I saw the rose come back in my cheeks and my skin tone evened out. I use this in conjunction with the Garnier dark spot corrector 2x a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this spf -- for me it&#x27;s the best one out there, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 2 years (having replaced my old favorite - Oil of Olay.  It goes on smooth, light, and dries quickly.  I use it on my face, neck, and upper chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living in San Diego, we get a lot of sun so having the built in sunscreen protection on my face saves me time and money by not having to apply another sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it fits in your TSA toiletries bag.  The top screws off so when you run out (which will take a few months), you can fill it with sunscreen or another item.</li>
    <li> Makes my face greasy &amp; my skin is not greasy.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It works great on sun spots and feels good on my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over eight years.  My dermatologist has commented on my skins appearance, and wanted to know what I use.  It has really helped with age spots and sun spots.  I apply daily to my face, neck, and hands.  This is a great price.</li>
    <li> I have really tried to like Garnier&#x27;s skin products. But honestly they keep leaving me disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Me, I am a 26 year old with combination skin. I don&#x27;t need miracles but I&#x27;d like some small changes in my skin. I have some skin spots I wanted to lighten on my face. And geez, I have tried so many things I decided to give this a try when it was on sale at a local store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I used it as instructed through the entire bottle and there were no results. None. I kept thinking that there&#x27;d be even a small change to warrant another purchase, but alas nothing happened. And I believe I know why it didn&#x27;t work for me. Everytime I put it on it did not absorb into my skin well. It would just sit as this filmy layer on top of my skin. It reminded me of playing withe Elmer&#x27;s glue as a kid, how you could put the glue on your fingers and then rub it off in little balls. That&#x27;s exactly what happened with this stuff if I even lightly touched my face. Forget about putting make up on with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, yes I did have my skin clean and exfoliated. It just didn&#x27;t absorb for me which makes me think that&#x27;s why it didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it is just my skin type though. Maybe it could work better for someone else!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy! It covers nicely, without being to thick and chalky. Works well in direct sun light as well.</li>
    <li> I love this for wearing under my make up. It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t make my face greasy! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It did not repair the red/brown marks on my skin from sun damage.  They are still there for all the world to see.  All it did for me was lighten my wallet.</li>
    <li> I&#x60;ve been using for a couple of months and I really like it. great under makeup.</li>
    <li> Great for diminishing visable age spots on tops of hands, feet and anyetx</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a year now. It&#x27;s actually superb. Leaves my skin feeling so great I don&#x27;t find the need to wear foundation most days. Get it!</li>
    <li> Did not moisturize very good, still had some dry areas I had to use another moisturizer on. But it&#x27;s not greasy and is good for sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year now.  Actually bought the spf 28 by mistake.  Used to by the lesser spf. But more is better! This is the only daily face moisturizer that I have found that is light and doesn&#x27;t break me out! And I&#x27;m 51 yrs old.  I&#x27;m a beach bum so this is great to use daily, as well as take with you to reapply when in the sun.  I&#x27;ve spent a lot more on Mary Kay anti-aging, Oil of Olay anti-aging, etc.  They all broke me out like a teenager.  If anti-aging means adding oil to my skin, I can&#x27;t do it.  I always go back to this product which costs 1/3 or less of the others.  I&#x27;m sticking to it this time!</li>
    <li> Love it, have sensitive and a lot of allergies, works well for me and does not burn my eyes or cause me any problems.. Does well in the very hot sun, no burning...</li>
    <li> I have used this product off and on.  I liked the non-greasy feel, and the nice smell.  I started using it more regularly after getting sunburned,and it turned out that I was allergic something in the ingredients.  I ended up going to immediate care--and getting prescriptions for oral and topical steroids.  I have combed the Garnier website to find a full list of ingredients, but have been unsuccessful.  I find I am also allergic to Garnier&#x27;s BB cream.  This is probably very specific to me--but wanted to let others know to watch out.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! I have dry skin and began using it two years ago. After using it the first week, my face and neck felt much softer and no longer dry or itchy. I love it that it also has sunscreen. I always apply it after cleansing my face.</li>
    <li> I love how this feels on my skin, and it works well to protect my skin from the sun.</li>
    <li> Great lotion! I love this stuff! It&#x27;s all I use.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I use it not only as a moisturizer but also as my daily sunscreen, because it works and because it doesn&#x27;t have that heavy, greasy feel of regular sunscreen.  I even convinced my husband to start using it daily as well, because he hates regular sunscreen.  After using it for awhile, he said it&#x27;s also improved his skin.  We highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week, and while it&#x27;s probably doing its job where sun protection is concerned, it&#x27;s leaving me very shiny and oily-feeling. I&#x27;ve broken out in little pimples on my face since using this product, likely because of the thickness of this lotion. If you&#x27;re prone to pimples at all or have sensitive or oily skin to begin with, skip this product and look for something else!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 5 years and will continue to use it for skin protection</li>
    <li> I started using this moisturizer after watching a Consumer Reports feature where they stated that out of multiple moisturizers tested in all price ranges, this was the only one found to truly work. I have rosacea and sensitive skin and this does not irritate my skin. Offers a little light daytime moisture and some additional SPF.</li>
    <li> This cream seems to work quite well but as other people have mentioned, the pump quite working on mine too. That is very frustrating. I have to take the top completely off and it gets pretty messy. Otherwise, the cream isn&#x27;t greasy and it does seem to lighten up my brown spots.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this, I was looking for a dark spot remover.  I dont know how this ended up on the list of what I was looking for therefore I domt think I can say that it worked for me.</li>
    <li> SEEMS TO WORK VERY WELL!  AND IN FLORIDA, YOU NEED SOMETHING LIKE THIS BECAUSE THERE&#x27;S NO WAY YOU CAN AVOID THE SUN 24/7.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me. It caused irritation immediately. I also noticed it left my face really shiny. I have very dry skin and have had this problem with other products. If you have sensitive skin I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I really love this Garnier skin care product.  My skin is dry and just sucks it up.  The cream has SPF 28 which my fair skin must have. My make-up glides over the product. If you have dry skin, try this product and I think you will like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Product arrived just as promised.  I think the product itself is one of the best on the market.  I would highly recommend it and the merchant I purchased it from.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer/sunscreen is a little too greasy for me to use in the summertime.  That being said, it will be fine once the winter weather sets in.  My skin is a bit oily and this moisturizer is kind of heavy but probably fine for normal to dry skin.  I love the fact that it has a high SPF and that I don&#x27;t have to use two separate products.  It smells nice, not like sunscreen.  It obviously contains oil of some sort or glycerin, which like I said, will be good for the drier winter months.  I prefer to use Mario Badescu&#x27;s oil free 30 SPF moisturizer in the summer with an added dose of Joy and Karma&#x27;s hyraluronic acid serum (which I use all year round), which is a fast absorbing gel.  I am giving this Garnier moisturizer four stars instead of five because it&#x27;s a bit too rich for my skin type.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a nice basic moisturizer with sun protection. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have never found a product that does not make my skin breakout until now.  I started using this to fade sun spots on my face and after a couple months I noticed it has made my skin feel and look so much healthier.  I love the sun and my skin was starting to really show it&#x27;s age.  I&#x27;m 48.  My skin looks tighter and smoother and is much softer.  It hasn&#x27;t really gotten rid of the sun spots, but they have faded a little.  I am so happy with this product.  I use it every night and every morning.  A little bit goes a long way, too.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other moisturizers and always come back to this one. It is a good product for people with sun damage and want a stronger Spf. I use glycerin, vitamin c serum, and finish with Garnier Anti-Sun Damage. I am very happy with the look of my skin, as I spend a lot of time in the Florida sun.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the SPF and on recommendation from several people I know who swear Garnier products aren&#x27;t irritating to sensitive skin. The first time I applied it, I loved the moisture this gave my face, and it feels silky smooth. It didn&#x27;t cause any irritation at all. It also didn&#x27;t feel chalky or look ashy like a lot of products with higher SPFs can. I was very impressed, but the feeling unfortunately didn&#x27;t last. I used about half a bottle before writing this review, getting more irritated every time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hours after applying, the fragrance lingers. It&#x27;s a very nice smell, sort of fruity and sweet but when it&#x27;s on your face you can&#x27;t get away from it. I&#x27;ve never used a moisturizer whose scent didn&#x27;t dissipate in a very short time, but I could still smell this one in the evening when I applied it in the morning. I also noticed that no matter how careful I was about not getting it around my eyes, it wound up in them anyway. I don&#x27;t know what it is, but I think this lotion sits on top of the skin rather than sinking in and manages to migrate into my eyes every time I use it. It does leave a little bit of an oily layer on my skin, but not enough that its bothersome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m harumphing over this lotion because in some ways I really like it, but you can&#x27;t wear something that smells like someone shoved a fruit basket up your nose all day and runs in your eyes.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for a week now and my skin has already shown significant improvement. My skin on the left side of my face has been getting progressively darker and splotchy. I have started spending a lot of hours in my car and the sun damage was beginning to show. I have dark skin so I was amazed at how powerful the uv rays are and how in such a short span of time have changed my skin. I tried the Shiseido 40 urban environment uv protection cream spf 40, but it was too heavy and gave my face a ghastly white tint.&lt;br /&gt;This product goes on creamy and light and absorbes into my skin instantly. My skin is brighter and more even toned now than it was only seven short days ago.&lt;br /&gt;For even more corrective power I pump equal parts of this product and my retinol cream every third night.</li>
    <li> Objectively, I did try the 4 weeks it states on the bottle (and actually another month.  Applied this product morning and night after cleansing my face.  For visible sun damage already that exist--it did nothing for.  It did not even lighten it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for taking \\&quot;current\\&quot; care of your skin it does work well.  My skin is softer and does look \\&quot;younger.\\&quot;  This Garnier product didn&#x27;t clog my pours or cause break outs.  I&#x27;m in my mid-30&#x27;s and my skin is in that annoying place of facial creams.  Facial moisturizers for oily skin or dry skin tend to make me break out.  Or moisturizers for more mature skin will give me rashes on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I am satisfied with it&#x27;s general performance, but not for the claim of fading previous sun damage.</li>
    <li> This is the best face lotion out there. For just a little bit you get all day moisture with sunscreen and all sorts of other good things for your skin. Sometimes if I don&#x27;t feel like wearing make up I put this on and I&#x27;m out the door. I also wear it at night, especially in the winter when my skin feels a little drier.</li>
    <li> Hello, I bought this product in hopes that it would help fight against sun damage. However, the minute i got it i looked at the ingredients and found out that it has the all the same ingredients has regular sun block. I say SAVE YOUR MONEY AND JUST BUY REGULAR SUNBLOCK, because that is all this is.</li>
    <li> I bought this product mainly for the possiblity it might even out my skin tone. My chin is always red and I have tried many different things to soothe it. The first time I tried this product, it evened out my blotchy red skin and my face was noticeably softer. After the first day, and the first week, my face has evened out, my sun spots have faded, and my face feels awesome. I highly recommend this product. I love it. My face looks so much better. Oh, and if you have large pores on your nose, this product has made mine noticably smaller! Big plus!</li>
    <li> Not greasy, seems to be working on my sun damaged skin.  I will definitely be using this as my go-to moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Garnier Skincare Renew Anti-sun Damage Spf 28 since it was first sold.  I&#x27;ve worn it every single day to protect my face from sun damage.  I love to garden and hike, so I need a product that protects me and doesn&#x27;t come off.  This product does that.  It feels good, not sticky, greasy, or overly creamy.  Unfortunately, Garnier seems to have stopped making it and seems to have stopped making their night cream also.  The night cream is just as good as the day cream.  Too bad that good, reasonably priced products and the ones we count on are suddenly gone.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT GOES ON CLEAN NOT STICKY</li>
    <li> I have tried so many creams over the counter as well more expensive but I have used this for over a year.  It not only is a moisturizer but it lighten any dark spots as well.  I no longer want to try any others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for some time and been very happy with it. Recently I decided to order it from Amazon rather than buying locally. Because another Amazon customer had noticed a difference in packaging and had discovered her bottle was nearly out of date, I called the company to check the production date when I saw that the bottle I received looked different. The product I received was more than three years old, outside the tested validity limit for the sunscreen. The seller is refunding my money, but I should not have had to do this sort of checking for product quality--and I would not have known to do it but for the report of another customer.  Loss of a star on this goes to Amazon for allowing this to take place rather than to Garnier for its product.</li>
    <li> Not greasy.  I was happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Love how this smells, very clean.  Good sunscreen also.</li>
    <li> Its way too thick and breaks me out. I had the garnier light moisturizer spf 15, and LOVED it! but decided I should be using a broad spectrum and atleast a 30 spf for true sun protection so naturally I chose this one based on my experience with the 15. I really don&#x27;t like it and will just use it as an expensive body sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about the spf and the anti-sun damage protection, but I find this moisturizer to be really good. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s &#x27;heavily scented&#x27; like some people claim.  It sinks right into your skin and is very lightweight in feeling afterwards. It smells great, and didn&#x27;t bring me any allergic reactions or anything.  I would definitely buy this again, great for combination skin.</li>
    <li> Almost emptied the bottle now. My face got a little brighter . I think it is working for overall face shade. Not had changed for my dark spots yet..</li>
    <li> Good production, love it.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for about 2 years, I live in Phoenix so have to be careful about UV... this is working</li>
    <li> love the smell of this lotion and it&#x27;s very light and non greasy.</li>
    <li> No change in my skin tone.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this is a good sun block for me....moisturizing but not greasy</li>
    <li> I get one each year to use as a sunscreen and it does a fantastic job--prevents burn without being causing pimples. Used as a daily moisturizer, it provides plenty of moisture for summertime skin.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite moisturizer. I like the higher SPF, but it doesn&#x27;t smell too much like sunscreen. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out or look oily.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.  Both my boyfriend and I use it.  He has sun damage from years of driving for a living but this product has greatly improved the sun damage done to his skin.  I have some sun damage as well, and I&#x27;ve really seen improvements.</li>
    <li> SO far I loke this product and I like all of Garnier&#x27;s products.  The smell is light but very nice.  I will come back and update the results after a few weeks.  I really am curious to see if it helps correct dark spots, but of course, lemon juice will do that.  Just cut a lemon and rub on your skin, and it&#x27;s all natural.  And lemon will tone, has natural fruit acids, and did you know that lemon kills bacteria?  But lemon doesn&#x27;t moisturize or provide UV protection, so -</li>
    <li> i actually bought this to have a quick and easy higher SPF hand lotion in my purse during the summer, especially when driving.  unfortunately, it leaves a really greasy residue, much more so than my aveeno face lotion (but the aveeno bottle is weirdly shaped to carry in your purse, hence my purchase here).  greasy finger prints on car doors, on my desk, phone, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also really stung my eyes the few times i tried to use it while touching up make-up.</li>
    <li> I use this product along with the Garnier Skin Care to remove dark spots.  Since I have only been using both products for about 10 weeks, I still have not seen any lightening of the dark spots on my face.  I will continue using it because it is also a moisturizer and give it more time to take effect.</li>
    <li> Used this product for years.  It has a light texture and great scent.  It is not greasy like other lotions.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I love all of Garnier&#x27;s products from skincare to haircare. They work great. They smell great. They don&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
    <li> Smells like sunscreen. When you read the active ingredients, it says it is a sunscreen. Guess I should have purchased sunscreen, which would have been less expensive. I guess I should have realized that&#x27;s what &amp;#34;Anti-sun&amp;#34; meant, but I expected it to do a bit more about the dark spots.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t really help with my dark spots even though I used it everyday and went through two full bottles of this stuff. Maybe &#x27;cause I didn&#x27;t have really dark spots? I don&#x27;t know. All I know is I&#x27;ll be finding another product to use.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years. Lightweight lotion, no over-powering smell. Good base for my Bare Minerals makeup. Absorbs well. Handy size.</li>
    <li> Garnier products including hair care burn my eyes even in proximity. I do not like their products. Threw it away.</li>
    <li> My skin is a combination of extreme oily and extreme dryness (from using acne medication). I have a lot of acne blemishes and wanted to try something that wasn&#x27;t too expensive. When I was using it, it really did work- that was the only pro for me. The cons are that it is too oily and heavy feeling. Also, there&#x27;s a fragrance, which smells nice, but it causes my dry skin to feel irritated. All in all, I would recommend this if you don&#x27;t mind a oily, heavy cream.</li>
    <li> Got rashes all over my face..I have a sensitive skin and it&#x27;s not suitable for my skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product a long time.  I love the sunscreen in this lotion and it does not make me break out.  I have pre-skin cancer and this product has been excellent in keeping it under control.  It wears well under my make-up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and I really love it. I am a cosmetics/skin care junkie. I have tried really expensive moisturizers and I always come back to this one. It&#x27;s light and fresh and gives you a brighter look. I like the smell -- it&#x27;s not offensive like some of them (I&#x27;m talking to you, Aveeno). It&#x27;s a great price point and it has good SPF for every day.</li>
    <li> Used as a moisturizer under makeup, great smell!</li>
    <li> I find that this product works well. However,  I can hardly get past the smell. I can only describe it as a mechanical/oil/chemical smell. I definitely will not purchase this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I wear this to keep my skin hydrated, also as a foundation primer. Works great,good SPF... but if you have sensitive skin, may sting after washing your face</li>
</ol>
