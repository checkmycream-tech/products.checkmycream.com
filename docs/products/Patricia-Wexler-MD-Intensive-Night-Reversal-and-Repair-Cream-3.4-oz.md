    <li> Love the Wexler products, I have been using them for several years</li>
    <li> I like this night cream, it is substantial but not too heavy, and works very well for dry skin and is gentle.  Good value for the money.</li>
    <li> My wife has been buying Wexler products and really likes them.  I purchased this as a gift for Christmas.  The only problem I had was when the shipment arrived, it was only the 1.7 oz size when I had paid for 3.4 oz size.  I contacted the shipper (email was on the enclosed receipt) and quickly received a apology for their mistake.  They stated they would ship me another 1.7 oz bottle immediately at no additional cost.  I am happy to report that I did receive the additional shipment as promised and have found the shipper to be reliable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product at least 5 times. I&#x27;ve never used a product for this long a period of time. It&#x27;s not that it does drastic improvements but it keeps my skin healthy &amp; moisturized. I have very sensitive skin &amp; still prone to breakouts (58 years old). It&#x27;s one of the few products I&#x27;ve found in years that I have bought more than twice so I guess that&#x27;s saying something!</li>
    <li> Been using it for years, and it strengthens and softens my skin while I sleep.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years ...love it.  I use this for my night and day cream as I found the day cream to greasy for my skin.</li>
    <li> I am 59 and I live in AZ.  Need I say more?  I use Retrinol (a Retin-A product) which is great for keeping my skin young-looking, but I still end up with dryness.  I slather this product on and my skin just drinks it up. It is well worth the money.  The 3.4 oz size lasts a long time.  I put it in a small container for travel so my supply stays fresh.  The other Bath and Body Works products have been disappointing, but not this one.</li>
    <li> This is amazing night cream.  I does not irritate my skin in any way and I love the way my face feels after a wash and application of the Night Cream&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Patricia Wexler&#x27;s skin care line works wonders on my mature skin!  The Intensive Night Reversal and Repair Cream is one of her best products.  I&#x27;m so glad to find it here, where the price comes in a little under what this product usually costs during an exceptionally good sale at Bath and Body Works.</li>
    <li> I just purchased the Intensive Night Reversal and Repair Cream.  I have only used it for two nights so far and I LOVE IT!  It felt amazing right after I put it on.  When I awoke the next day, my skin really looked like it was glowing.  I have been living in Nevada and have had a lot of sun exposure over the last year and a half (even though I DO use SPF daily).  This cream moisturized my skin and I can tell it is evening out my blotchy spots, and this was only on day 1.  I really look forward to bedtime so that I can put this on my face, and every morning I love to wake up and see what it has done overnight.  I also purchased ther daytime moisturizer with SPF.  It seems to work well and moisturize.  I noticed my skin was slightly irritated the first day that I used it but I was outside in the sun for about 2 hours.       I thought the price tag was a bit hefty, but I think this will last me for 5 to 6 months at a once a night ritual.  I would highly recommend this product to any and every woman out there who is looking for a serious moisturizing system that makes your skin look and feel amazing and evens out your skin tone.  Give it a try, worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I purchased this from a brick and mortar for twice the cost for years.  It&#x27;s an outstanding product with consistent and noticeable results and I am thrilled to have a new vendor who supplies a terrific product at an even better price.</li>
    <li> Bought this cream, the day pink gel in the white container, the eye cream and the 2 step glycol pads. Been using over 3 months and I have seen ZERO results. In fact my face has gotten worse. My pores are horrible. Waste of all that money. I don&#x27;t tan or sit in the sun either. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel wonderful!</li>
    <li> This is the best night creme I ever used!</li>
    <li> I love it . I use this cream for about 8-10 years and I am very happy. Thank you Patricia Wexler !</li>
    <li> Amazing cream. It really helped my complexion. I was mistaken for my daughters sister!</li>
    <li> I have been able to find better products.  I have found it to be better than products purchased at retail stores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years as well.  It&#x27;s not too oily, but sometimes I feel like it&#x27;s not moisturizing enough.  But I like to err on the side of less oily so until someone convinces me otherwise, I&#x27;m sticking to this.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS BEFORE BUT FOUND PERLIER FACE LIFT CREME BETTER</li>
    <li> I love her products.  I have used this for years.  Nothing is better.</li>
    <li> Wonderful - medium-thick cream, but it doesn&#x27;t lay heavily on your skin. It&#x27;s just right.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about 2 weeks, honestly I don&#x27;t see any difference.....  Feels good when I apply it at night though... Hoping I will notice something after longer use.....</li>
    <li> My wife loves this cream.  It&#x27;s more expensive than many other face creams, but she believes it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Love this face cream, have been using it for years.  Recommend it totally!</li>
    <li> Been using this product since this line was sold at Bath and Body Works.  As sparingly as we use this (just need a little for forehead and around eyes and face) it lasts almost a year...close to it.  Never experience a reaction to this product, and I notice the results of continued use.  I&#x27;ve purchased this for at least 7 or 8 years.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really a night reversal cos all the strain will zapped off by morning.But will write better review when I have used it for a longer period.</li>
    <li> Definitely not worth the money.  Very heavy.  My pores got clogged&lt;br /&gt;There are so many better night creams than this</li>
    <li> While I really do not have wrinkles I noticed my face was looking dry in photographs. My sister told me about and let me use the Night Cream while I stayed with her for about a week. I noticed a difference in two days. It&#x27;s magic.</li>
