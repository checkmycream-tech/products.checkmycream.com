      <li>Zim&#x27;s is the best hand creme that I have found to combat dry winter weather.  </li>
      <li>Best hand creme for dry, cracked hands.</li>
      <li>This is the greatest product for dry, cracked skin.  </li>
      <li>My mother-in-law introduced Crack Creme to me many moons ago, in it&#x27;s original (I believe</li>
      <li>but I could just as easily be convinced it&#x27;s a 5 star product.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the fast delivery and great price.    </li>
      <li>I was so happy to find it online at Amazon because the local wal marts and meijer stores where I used to buy it no longer carry it.</li>
      <li>No other product works as good as this Creme.  </li>
      <li>Without a doubt, absolutely the best product for severely dry cracked hands.  </li>
      <li>Get the original formula - I tried the diabetic formula and it seems greasier</li>
      <li>the original folrmula</li>
      <li>Long time user of this product- works great.</li>
      <li>I have always used the original formula and thought I would try this one.</li>
      <li>I still prefer to use original formula at night when I go to bed and the creamy daytime formula during the day when needed.</li>
      <li>The whole family is pleased with this.  </li>
      <li>It works great, smells fantastic and solves the dry heels problem for the whole family.  </li>
      <li>I was lucky to find the product on Amazon very reasonably priced and immediately available for shipment in a pack of 4 tubes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for dry crack hands like we all get in our New England winters!</li>
      <li>Thanks for having it available for us.</li>
      <li>they always have it and the price is right and they will ship it right to your door.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
      <li>always get  get my order right from this site</li>
      <li>Love this product and will use it as long as it is available.</li>
      <li>This is an amazing formula for dry hands...  </li>
      <li>It really worked well, and healed my hands quickly.</li>
      <li>This is a Great Product but hard to find in stores.</li>
      <li>It is the first thing to work, so I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.</li>
      <li>Like most of these &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34; lotions on the market, this one also falls short of expectations.</li>
      <li>Bought it a second time to be sure.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just basically a hand lotion that smells funny.  </li>
      <li>;-) .</li>
      <li>Zim&#x27;s Crack Creme is fantastic for hardworking dry hands (skin), it has a neutral odor and gets absorbed pretty quick.</li>
      <li>To be honest, I don&#x27;t use a hand cream regularly (lack of discipline), and in the winter, my hands become dry and cracked, primarily because I wash my hands a lot.</li>
      <li>Of course it moisturizes and soothes skin that has been a victim of the elements; but it also has ingredients that help the skin to repair itself rapidly, relatively quickly sealing the break and making an effective protective layer that feels fairly natural but has a bit of leatheriness about it--actually a reassuring quality when one&#x27;s immediate interest is fast healing.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works but it smells funny</li>
      <li>Very non greasy.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t have to defer any work because my fingers hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much.</li>
      <li>I purchase this for my husband and he says it really works.</li>
      <li>Twenty four is too much to pay for one tube.</li>
      <li>I have an unusual situation, I think.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon for being there for me.</li>
      <li>This cream works very well.</li>
      <li>I think the manufacturer changed (weakened) the formula, or watered it down, so it&#x27;s nowhere near as effective as the first tube I bought at a drugstore.  </li>
      <li>The creamy daytime formula is wonderful 24 hours a day and completely absorbs in no time - yet has lasting, serious healing effect.  </li>
      <li>but this is an easy fix for a minor annoyance.</li>
      <li>I previously bought some Zim&#x27;s at Walgreens for dry cracked hands and it was great.  </li>

    <li> Zim&#x27;s Crack Creme is the best product for dry cuticles/hands, etc.  It smells a  little, but the results are worth it!!  I have been using it for 5 years since  recommended by a great friend.  Now more of my friends are using it also.  Can&#x27;t go wrong - highly recommend it and one tube lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> My husband has the worst dry hands and this is the only cream that works for him. Not greasy and soaks in fast and give instant relief and no sweet or flowery scent.</li>
    <li> This non-greasy cream is perfect.  The cream contains arnica which is a minor pain reliever as well.  Used to be carried by Walgreens and now I can only find it at Amazon.</li>
    <li> I am a violinist, so I can&#x27;t ever use lotion on my hands that leaves any residue.  Consequently, I often suffer from cracks in my skin during winter. . . UNTIL another musician friend told me about Ziim&#x27;s Crack Cream!  The creamy daytime formula is wonderful 24 hours a day and completely absorbs in no time - yet has lasting, serious healing effect.  I have also tried a nighttime formula that is more of an oil - also very good, but not as quickly absorbed.  Being able to buy Zim&#x27;s Crack Cream in a 4-pack at Amazon is a great deal.  THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for years but was having trouble finding it in stores.  Thank heavens I found it on Amazon.  I ordered the 4 pack so I wouldn&#x27;t run out.  The service was great and the price was very good.  I will be ordering more again when I run out.  Works wonders during the winter when hands get so dry and cracked, this stuff really works to heal sore hands.</li>
    <li> The name says it all: \\&quot;crack cream\\&quot;. In the cold weather, the skin around my thumb nails dries out and then cracks and bleeds. It&#x27;s not the worst thing that can happen to you but this is an easy fix for a minor annoyance. It&#x27;s not a general moisturizer (at least I do&#x27;t use it that way). I just make sure to work it in on my finger nails and it simply works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned by someone else, it don&#x27;t seem to be the \\&quot;same\\&quot; product I recall seeing years ago, but time marches on and formulas change. All I know is that it does what I want it to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am rating it as 4 stars (it is, after all a skin cream) but I could just as easily be convinced it&#x27;s a 5 star product. Maybe I&#x27;m just in a bad mood today? ;-) .</li>
    <li> I live in a very rural area an panicked when my local Wal-Mart and Walgreen&#x27;s discontinued this product. I was lucky to find the product on Amazon very reasonably priced and immediately available for shipment in a pack of 4 tubes. This amount will hold us for a while. This product works so well I can;t imagine bring without it. Thanks for the fast delivery and great price.    mariah</li>
    <li> I previously bought some Zim&#x27;s at Walgreens for dry cracked hands and it was great.  This is not the same stuff and I don&#x27;t know why.    It&#x27;s just basically a hand lotion that smells funny.  The previous stuff smelled the same but really worked.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest product for dry, cracked skin.  The liquid product works a little quicker but the lotion is easier to use.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful cream for your hands to keep them from drying out.  It smells so good.</li>
    <li> This is the only hand cream that heals and keeps the winter cold from drying and cracking my fingers. So glad to be able to order it in quantiy.</li>
    <li> Needed this for dry and cracked winter hands. It really worked well, and healed my hands quickly. This is a good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years.  It&#x27;s great for dry crack hands like we all get in our New England winters!</li>
    <li> Great lube!  I used it in cracks I never knew were there before..</li>
    <li> A friend of mine got me using this cream a few years ago.  I don&#x27;t really have problems in the summer, but in the winter, in Indiana, my hands are really rough and I get cracks in my fingers around the nails. This cream is the only thing I have found that helps keep the cracks away.  My daughter and son-in-law love it too and I always stick some in their stockings at Christmas.</li>
    <li> Creamy Daytime Formula by Zim&#x27;s Crack Creme is a sensational product. To be honest, I don&#x27;t use a hand cream regularly (lack of discipline), and in the winter, my hands become dry and cracked, primarily because I wash my hands a lot. Several winters ago, my hands were in particularly bad shape, dry, cracked and bleeding. Quite painful, in fact. After hearing a Zim&#x27;s commercial on radio, I purchased a tube of Creamy Daytime Formula.  Immediately upon applying Zim&#x27;s, all pain and discomfort disappeared. I continued applying it several times a day, and within about 48 hours, my hands were completely healed and back to normal. I&#x27;ve never had such success with any other lotion or cream. Additionally, I love the fact that it&#x27;s not the least bit greasy. I am now a certified Zim&#x27;s junkie.  I have the 6-oz. pump in the bath.  Also, I keep two or more 2.7-oz. tubes and a supply of the vanilla stick lip moisturizer around at all times (perfect for desk, briefcase, travel bag, coat pocket, etc.)</li>
    <li> I purchase this for my husband and he says it really works. Now our son uses it too, he tinkers on racing engines. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This stuff is terrific for hands damaged by the cold, dry winter. One of the bottles broke open during shipping, and PharmaFrag quickly sent a replacement.</li>
    <li> A wonderful product that takes dryness of the most dry and hardened feet and hands.It would probably be more popular if the changed the name.I even like to smell. Very non greasy.Many times better then all the designer softeners.</li>
    <li> When I asked my pharmacist what might help my dry and cracking hands, she pulled Zim&#x27;s out from behind the counter.  It is the first thing to work, so I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.</li>
    <li> I have been using Zim&#x27;s for years now for skin irritation.  It works.  It sooth&#x27;s real dry skin and starts the healing process.</li>
    <li> This is a Great Product but hard to find in stores. Every winter my thumb and finger will crack open around the fingernail. I have tried several different cremes and lotions. I even had a prescription creme but did not work as well as the Zim&#x27;s Crack Creme. I bought  extra tubes because I have a cleaning crew that works for me and their fingers were also cracking open due to drying out being in and out of water. One lady said her fingers healed quickly and loved it. Now she has recommended it to her company.</li>
    <li> Zim&#x27;s is the best hand creme that I have found to combat dry winter weather.  Helps speed healing and protects from the cold dry air.</li>
    <li> We love this product.  It works great, smells fantastic and solves the dry heels problem for the whole family.  We continue to use it year round and since we have a couple of basketball players in the family, they pack it in their gym bag!!  It is our &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; foot creme!!!</li>
    <li> Have used Zims for years.  Keeps northern winter cracked hands in better shape.  Not greasy, no residue.  Pleasent clove like scent.</li>
    <li> I suffer from terrible cracking of the skin around my fingernails, and Zim&#x27;s Crack Creme works better than any other hand creme I have ever tried. I also like that it is hardly greasy at all, such that I can use a bunch of it and massage it into my hands and then immediately begin typing or writing without that slippery feeling. I like the mild, slightly spicy smell, too, and I&#x27;m usually quite sensitive to fragrances.</li>
    <li> I have Raynaud&#x27;s disease.  In the winter months I am very, very uncomfortable with the cold and my finger-tips!  This crème helps to heal all the cracks that rapidly appear on my finger-tips seemingly over-night!</li>
    <li> Zim&#x27;s Crack Creme does a great job of healing skin that is cracked from winter dryness. Of course it moisturizes and soothes skin that has been a victim of the elements; but it also has ingredients that help the skin to repair itself rapidly, relatively quickly sealing the break and making an effective protective layer that feels fairly natural but has a bit of leatheriness about it--actually a reassuring quality when one&#x27;s immediate interest is fast healing. The leatheriness lasts as long as it needs to and then reverts to normal softness once the healing completes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should elaborate on what I mean by \\&quot;relatively quickly sealing the break\\&quot;: This is not a liquid-bandage type of product, so be prepared for it to take a few days to work its magic. I consider the thoroughness of the repair, along with the product&#x27;s excellent emollient qualities to be preferable to merely a quick fix.</li>
    <li> And I&#x27;ve been using it exclusively for over 10 years after trying Bag Balm, Corn Huskers, Gold Bond, you-name-it. No other product I&#x27;ve found comes even close to the effectiveness of this cream on severely chapped, dry, and /or cracked  skin on hands and feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A dollop smaller than a marble is totally adequate for both hands or both feet. Absorbed fully within a few minutes. Forget wearing gloves to bed. I&#x27;ll guarantee you that applying it, oh, say 15 minutes before going to bed for 3 to 4 nights in a row will cure all but flesh-eating bacteria! Not hype - fact!</li>
    <li> I have always used the original formula and thought I would try this one. It works just as well and not as messy. Rubs into your skin good and doesn&#x27;t leave it oily. I still prefer to use original formula at night when I go to bed and the creamy daytime formula during the day when needed.</li>
    <li> Because I only received one tube for 24 dollars. I was supposed to receive 4 tubes. Twenty four is too much to pay for one tube.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  In the winter I have really dry skin on my legs.  In addition I do dishes a lot and my skin dries and cracks. Crack Cream moistens &amp; heals it usually within 24 hours.</li>
    <li> I think the manufacturer changed (weakened) the formula, or watered it down, so it&#x27;s nowhere near as effective as the first tube I bought at a drugstore.  No reflection on the very fine seller.</li>
    <li> I have been a letter carrier for the postal service for over 31 years.  I have a lot of problems with the skin on my fingertips splitting near the nails.  This is the best product to help moisturize to prevent this and to heal it after it happens.  I have tried many different creams and lotions over the years and this is the best.  Developed by a pharmacist.  I was so happy to find it online at Amazon because the local wal marts and meijer stores where I used to buy it no longer carry it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before, but could not find it in local stores.  So on line I went.  The price was great and it arrived sooner then they projected.  What could be better?</li>
    <li> Not a big fan of those smelly, gooey cremes. Zim&#x27;s Crack Creme is fantastic for hardworking dry hands (skin), it has a neutral odor and gets absorbed pretty quick.</li>
    <li> This was a reorder of this product. I keep it on hand and stored in several places. Do not leave it in a vehicle in the summer time, you will have a mess to clean up. I also use the pump bottles. Although I have never seen where it was used for treatment of a toenail fungus, I kept spraying it on a big toe that had an annoying fungus under it. For six months I sprayed it on my toe nail and rubbed it in. Fungus is completely gone. It took 6 months for the nail to grow all the way out, the fungus was actually dead before that, but it was 6 months before the nail was clear.</li>
    <li> I have had problems with my fingertips cracking, which is very painful. After using this cream, I have gotten relief, and I thank you for carrying this product.</li>
    <li> My mother-in-law introduced Crack Creme to me many moons ago, in it&#x27;s original (I believe liquid) form.  I love this cream.  It moisturises without leaving your hands oily and it smells like &amp;#34;Bay Rum&amp;#34;.  Queer that I would like that but my parents were from central america and &amp;#34;Bay Rum&amp;#34; was the antidote to everything.  The smell brings me back to my youth.  The other plus is if someone has stolen your tube, the scent is a dead give away as to who has &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; it ... ahem ... dear husband!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> My husband has used this product for a number of years for his dry cracked hands in the winter. Unable now to purchase it locally,  we were so glad to be able to locate it through Amazon.  It does everything it says and more. My husband uses it faithfully and loves the results.</li>
    <li> It is working great on our cracked hands.  We have been able to purchase it locally until recently.  Thanks for having it available for us.</li>
    <li> top of the line does the job</li>
    <li> My hands are extremely dry and this product definitely moisturizers and soothes them. And as an added bonus, I like the clove smell. My local drug store used to carry this in the store, but now I have to order them on Amazon. When I run out of this product, I am also using Gold Bonds Ultra Healing with Aloe. It works pretty good too.</li>
    <li> I have never used any other product that works as well as Zim&#x27;s Crack Creme to heal cracks in your skin and help prevent dry skin in the winter.  It has a strange smell, but the creme seems to be absobed almost immediately into your skin, leaving no oily residue.  Get the original formula - I tried the diabetic formula and it seems greasier and I don&#x27;t think it worked as well as the original folrmula</li>
    <li> I have an unusual situation, I think.  I have two fingers on my right hand (index and middle fingers) that split open and are very painful.  The fingers split for no apparent reason, using Zims helps to lessen the impact of the cracking so I don&#x27;t have to defer any work because my fingers hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> Great seller, but Ingrediants have changed.  I no longer recommend.</li>
    <li> Best hand creme for dry, cracked hands.</li>
    <li> Without a doubt, absolutely the best product for severely dry cracked hands.  Moisturizes those painful fissures at the end of your fingers.</li>
    <li> MY WIFE USES THES AND SWEARS BY THEM! WE HAVE RE-ORDERED 3 TIMES!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years for wintertime dry skin and cracks.  It has a very mild, pleasant odor like very light cinnamon; which is important to me as I detest the perfume smell of most creams.</li>
    <li> Bought it a second time to be sure. Like most of these &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34; lotions on the market, this one also falls short of expectations.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing formula for dry hands...  Can&#x27;t live without it!  I have a tube in my purse, diaper bag, car, and bedside table!</li>
    <li> This cream works very well. I have several tubes going at one time in everyplace I go, truck, home, vacation home, etc. My hands take a beating being in water so much all year round.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hand cream for several years if your fingers split and crack on the tips like mine do&lt;br /&gt;you will never find a better product to use. Within a couple days of steady use your fingers will be healed up.&lt;br /&gt;In fact once you have applied cream you can feel it going to work. I used to buy this cream at WM but they quit&lt;br /&gt;selling it so I buy from Amazon they always have it and the price is right and they will ship it right to your door.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion it doesn&#x27;t get any better :)</li>
    <li> This stuff really works but it smells funny so don&#x27;t put it on before a romantic date. But it WILL cure your dry hands and cracked skin. It trumps any lotion you find on the shelves in the beauty aisle.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find locally. Good product. Well pleased.</li>
    <li> Zim&#x27;s is by far the best seasonal crack creme I have ever used. There&#x27;s no overpowering aroma. It&#x27;s non greasy. And, most of all, it repairs damaged skin on my fingers, ankles and heels. The tips of my thumbs are the hardest to heal, but Zim&#x27;s does the job in no time.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products available for keeping your hands from cracking in the winter.  Love this product and will use it as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> As I have gotten older my skin is thinning, this absolutely works on my hands and arms and legs, great stuff!!</li>
    <li> I have used Zim&#x27;s Crack Cream for years to help my  feet from cracking and hurting in the winter times.  It is really great and within two or three days of using it, my friend who had suffered for years with large painful cracked heels was cured.  Use to be able to get it at Walmart but now I can only find it at Amazon.com.  Thanks Amazon for being there for me.</li>
    <li> Best product ever. If you work in construction or you clean your house and have dry soup hands zims Will rejuvenate your skin.</li>
    <li> The whole family is pleased with this.  WE try to keep extra tubes on hand(ha!).  We never run out.</li>
    <li> My husband is a letter carrier so he&#x27;s out everyday all day through the winter weather with his fingers exposed.  He gets terrible cracks at the tips of his fingers.  This is the first product that has actually worked for him.  He packs a tube around with him everywhere he goes.</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t live with out it  great for my cracks in my hand from work  always get  get my order right from this site</li>
    <li> Long time user of this product- works great.</li>
    <li> I Have used this product for years. Recently I tried to find it locally but they no longer carried it.  I buy more than one at a time, so this Pack of 4 worked perfectly for me.  No other product works as good as this Creme.  My husband likes it too</li>
    <li> i have used it for years, it is hard to find in stores. when my feet crack and bleed it is the only thing that helps immediatly</li>
    <li> Smells great and softens skin</li>
    <li> My husbands hand are extremely dry in the cold winter.  The best thing I have found to help his problem.</li>
