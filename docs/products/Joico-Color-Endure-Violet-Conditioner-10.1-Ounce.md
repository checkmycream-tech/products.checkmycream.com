### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I use it twice a week and my hair looks great!</li>
      <li>Smells good!</li>
      <li>Amazing product!</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant scent that isn&#x27;t over powering.</li>
      <li>Love this product!  </li>
      <li>It tones my bleached hair perfectly to take out that yellow tone.</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>In my opinion, the shampoo works much better than the conditioner.</li>
      <li>So be sure to use a leave-in conditioner or re-condition your hair with another brand after using.</li>
      <li>Three years of trying products this is the best grey hair enhancer I have found.</li>
      <li>Perfect for every blonde to keep color fresh.</li>
      <li>It helps me keep my colour (which for me is a plus), it helps md when combing not lose so much hair, and smell s nice.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed!</li>
      <li>After awhile my blonde turns yellowish-brassy and this makes my hair a beautiful blonde shade.</li>
      <li>I used this tonight for the first time.</li>
      <li>Keeps my platinum blonde highlights fresh.</li>
      <li>This works but not nearly as well and as quick as the shampoo does.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair soft, too!</li>
      <li>My hair truly feels clean after I use it, unlike some other toning shampoo and conditioners.</li>
      <li>I have an ombr&amp;eacute; hair color, and in just one use I saw a change in my hair, all the brass and &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34;  highlighter yellow had minimized and the ombr&amp;eacute; even seem to blend a little better.</li>
      <li>Shampoo leaves hair soft anyways.</li>
      <li>Works very well, but doesn&#x27;t necessarily condition your hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been letting my naturally premature white hair grow out and bleached my brown dyed hair to help me transition to white.</li>

    <li> Three years of trying products this is the best grey hair enhancer I have found. Just enough bluing to bring out the silver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been letting my naturally premature white hair grow out and bleached my brown dyed hair to help me transition to white. The bleached blonde was starting to get brassy. I used this tonight for the first time. It toned down the brassiness with just the kne use. It has a purplish tiny but it didn&#x27;t stain anything in my shower or cause a mess. It has a pleasant scent that isn&#x27;t over powering.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner. It tones my bleached hair perfectly to take out that yellow tone. I use it about every 3 days or so, and it works like charm. It also doesn&#x27;t feel like it damages my hair or leaves a residue. My hair truly feels clean after I use it, unlike some other toning shampoo and conditioners.</li>
    <li> Meant to order the shampoo! This works but not nearly as well and as quick as the shampoo does. Shampoo leaves hair soft anyways.</li>
    <li> Smells good! Its the only conditioner that I use on my high-lighted hair. It helps me keep my colour (which for me is a plus), it helps md when combing not lose so much hair, and smell s nice.</li>
    <li> Took the brassy out of my blonde!!</li>
    <li> Rec&#x27;d totally wrong product!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I hate the brassiness on bleached hair.  This takes away any orange hues and brings out the brightness.  Doesn&#x27;t dry my hair or scalp.</li>
    <li> Zero brass on my silver blonde hair. I use it twice a week and my hair looks great! Perfect for every blonde to keep color fresh. Leaves hair soft, too!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I have an ombr&amp;eacute; hair color, and in just one use I saw a change in my hair, all the brass and &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34;  highlighter yellow had minimized and the ombr&amp;eacute; even seem to blend a little better.</li>
