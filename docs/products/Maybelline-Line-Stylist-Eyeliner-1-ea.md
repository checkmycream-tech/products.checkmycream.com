      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>It always draws the perfect line.  </li>
      <li>I was very happy to be able to buy this product since it has been discontinued.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many eye pencils over the years and this one has to be the best around.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how this got good reviews.</li>
      <li>good price.</li>
      <li>This is the best, thinnest, blackest,  most precise liner!</li>
      <li>It would be great in those out-on-the-town emergencies, and if nothing else would feel more honest for what you get.</li>
      <li>It is great with fine lining and does not feel like a needle or pencil when applying.</li>
      <li>nice color.</li>
      <li>I love this eyeliner</li>
      <li>My Favorite eye liner of all time.</li>
      <li>I love this eye liner pencil.  </li>
      <li>I love this eyeliner.  </li>
      <li>I was pleased with the person who I had purchased it from.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s accurate -</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t break easily, doesn&#x27;t scrape my eye.  </li>
      <li>This eyeliner is quite easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It breaks way too easy and crumbles.</li>
      <li>easy to use.</li>
      <li>Breaks easily and does not apply smoothly.</li>
      <li>Looks great especially defining.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t smear unless rubbed.  </li>
      <li>free shipping.</li>
      <li>It glides on smooth and does not break.  </li>
      <li>but you can make that look with any eyeliner if you are precise.</li>
      <li>I am very precise and gentle and this will still break and crumble.</li>
      <li>but it was too light and didn&#x27;t really make my eyes pop, nor did it show any \\&quot;sparkles.\\</li>
      <li>The line is just the right width.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply, and leaves a nice dark, even, straight line.  </li>
      <li>This item arrived very fast.</li>
      <li>But the value isn&#x27;t there for me, and for essentially a travel size of product, travel size packaging would be better suited.  </li>
      <li>Doing the math actually puts the price in perspective, as well - 40x more product for 3x the price...</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just a matter of packaging, but I expect a long pencil to have more product in it.  </li>
      <li>That said, these are minor quibbles, and this has been my favorite eye liner for a couple of years now.</li>
      <li>, I like this product very much, but I did take away one star for the annoyances (which are not annoying enough for me to stop buying it).&lt;br /</li>
      <li>I say save your cash skip this product and be more precise to make a small line with thicker eyeliners.</li>
      <li>It would be nice to know when you are running low, but I generally have a couple around anyway.  </li>
      <li>Such a fine, controlled line.</li>
      <li>I had tried to fine this eyeliner again at my local drug store chains with no luck.</li>
      <li>It is the only eyeliner I&#x27;ve tried that  can give a fine line and not smudge.</li>
      <li>I only use a pencil eyeliner on my lower waterline, opting instead to let my eyeshadow or mascara do the talking, and even then I feel like I used this pencil up SO quickly!  </li>
      <li>and they ship very rapid and is just like they described it will shop with them again</li>
      <li>Much cheaper than what I used to pay at stores.</li>
      <li>would really recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>By contrast, one of my other preferred pencils is 0.04 oz - that&#x27;s 40 times more product.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It still gets 3 stars because it does work well, draws a very thin and accurate line, and the color shows nicely.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find one with the right thinness because I like to draw thin lines on my lids and underneath the eye, so this product was perfect.</li>
      <li>I like very fine lines for my eyeliner, so I always wasted a lot of product with frequent sharpening.</li>
      <li>I love basic black and that&#x27;s exactly what this is.</li>
      <li>I keep going back to this product after trying so many other liners.</li>
      <li>First of all, you can&#x27;t tell how much you have left, so you have to have a back up, because you&#x27;ll run out with no warning.  </li>
      <li>I find this eyeliner to be a huge waste of money.</li>
      <li>I thought it was a fluke the first time, but after giving it a second go around with similar results I have decided to start looking for a new brand.</li>
      <li>I have used tons of high end eyeliners and still come back to this one.  </li>
      <li>Really lands where I put it without smudging and bleeding; plus lasts all day long.</li>
      <li>The biggest complaint I have about this liner is that it runs out so quickly!</li>
      <li>I only wear a modest amount of eyeliner maybe three times a week.</li>
      <li>Most of your products will be broken off or crumbled off.</li>
      <li>and I love a thin line.  </li>
      <li>I especially like that it&#x27;s easy to draw thin or thick cat eyes at the end too, and if I make a mistake, it&#x27;s easy to rub off with a Q-tip or even with my finger if I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
      <li>but I thought it would be like Chapstick, or something), because it doesn&#x27;t roll down; the twist only goes one way, and if you roll it up a little too far, the end will crumble off with light pressure (say, applying it to your eye-type pressure) since it&#x27;s so</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the best, thinnest, blackest,  most precise liner! I don&#x27;t understand why it was discontinued!!</li>
    <li> I hate this eyeliner! The tip makes it very difficult and awkward to make any sort of straight pprecise line on the upper lid. It breaks way too easy and crumbles. Will NEVER purchase this eyeliner again.</li>
    <li> NOT THE SAME EYELINER FROM THE STORE. Breaks easily and does not apply smoothly.</li>
    <li> very hard to find in our area and they ship very rapid and is just like they described it will shop with them again</li>
    <li> This item arrived very fast. Much cheaper than what I used to pay at stores. Great product! Can&#x27;t buy it anymore it is not sold in any stores.</li>
    <li> The line is just the right width.  Not too thick.</li>
    <li> I only use a pencil eyeliner on my lower waterline, opting instead to let my eyeshadow or mascara do the talking, and even then I feel like I used this pencil up SO quickly!  Maybe it&#x27;s just a matter of packaging, but I expect a long pencil to have more product in it.  And yes, I know that it says it has 0.001 oz, I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s accurate - I&#x27;m only speaking to the perception of the packaging and that you have no way of knowing it&#x27;s gone until it&#x27;s gone.  By contrast, one of my other preferred pencils is 0.04 oz - that&#x27;s 40 times more product.  Doing the math actually puts the price in perspective, as well - 40x more product for 3x the price...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It still gets 3 stars because it does work well, draws a very thin and accurate line, and the color shows nicely.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  But the value isn&#x27;t there for me, and for essentially a travel size of product, travel size packaging would be better suited.  It would be great in those out-on-the-town emergencies, and if nothing else would feel more honest for what you get.</li>
    <li> I love this eye liner pencil.  It always draws the perfect line.  I have tried so many eye pencils over the years and this one has to be the best around.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to be able to buy this product since it has been discontinued. I was pleased with the person who I had purchased it from.</li>
    <li> I have tried countless brands and types of eyeliner, and I will never find another quite like this one.  Easy to apply, and leaves a nice dark, even, straight line.  Doesn&#x27;t break easily, doesn&#x27;t scrape my eye.  It would be nice to know when you are running low, but I generally have a couple around anyway.  Onyx is the way to go.  Black sparkle is almost gray.</li>
    <li> I like very fine lines for my eyeliner, so I always wasted a lot of product with frequent sharpening. Then I found this, which never needs sharpening.  So, eye makeup Nirvana.  Well, almost.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like this product very much, but I did take away one star for the annoyances (which are not annoying enough for me to stop buying it).&lt;br /&gt;  First of all, you can&#x27;t tell how much you have left, so you have to have a back up, because you&#x27;ll run out with no warning.  Also, you can&#x27;t just twist it all the way up to look and see how much is left (yeah, yeah, but I thought it would be like Chapstick, or something), because it doesn&#x27;t roll down; the twist only goes one way, and if you roll it up a little too far, the end will crumble off with light pressure (say, applying it to your eye-type pressure) since it&#x27;s so thin.&lt;br /&gt;  That said, these are minor quibbles, and this has been my favorite eye liner for a couple of years now.</li>
    <li> nice color. good price. free shipping. easy to use. would really recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a few other colors as well.&lt;br /&gt;thanks maybelline!</li>
    <li> I have used tons of high end eyeliners and still come back to this one.  I hate liquid and I love a thin line.  This is perfect for me.  There&#x27;s no sharpening involved, it simply rolls up and makes the thinnest line possible.  I love basic black and that&#x27;s exactly what this is.</li>
    <li> I never really got used to liquid eyeliner since it&#x27;s so messy and tend to smudge, but I really like this pencil/crayon eyeliner.

I like the Onyx and Espresso the best. I&#x27;ve tried the Black Sparkle before but it was too light and didn&#x27;t really make my eyes pop, nor did it show any \\&quot;sparkles.\\&quot; It&#x27;s cheaper to buy through Amazon too versus the usual $7 or $8 at stores.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner.  I bought it in espresso as well.  It glides on smooth and does not break.  The color is just what I wanted</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner it goes on smooth,easy and the line is slim or thick whichever way</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this got good reviews. I like that it&#x27;s tiny for small lines....but you can make that look with any eyeliner if you are precise. I find this eyeliner to be a huge waste of money. Most of your products will be broken off or crumbled off. It&#x27;s very very weak. I am very precise and gentle and this will still break and crumble. I say save your cash skip this product and be more precise to make a small line with thicker eyeliners.</li>
    <li> Such a fine, controlled line. I keep going back to this product after trying so many other liners. A negative is that you don&#x27;t know how much is left, but still worth using. Really lands where I put it without smudging and bleeding; plus lasts all day long.</li>
    <li> My Favorite eye liner of all time. It doesn&#x27;t run down my face and lasts all day at work. Very happy.</li>

    <li> Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t smear unless rubbed.  Looks great especially defining. It is great with fine lining and does not feel like a needle or pencil when applying.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is quite easy to apply. It smudges a little but but stays on longer than average. The biggest complaint I have about this liner is that it runs out so quickly! I only wear a modest amount of eyeliner maybe three times a week. This product is gone in 2-3 weeks max. The eyeliner stick itself is thin and prone to breakage so you end up losing quite a bit of the eyeliner when it breaks off and falls to the floor. I thought it was a fluke the first time, but after giving it a second go around with similar results I have decided to start looking for a new brand.</li>
