<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This gel really boosts your skin moisture content.  I used it for a couple of days before my wife spotted it and made off with it.  She&#x27;s in her late 40&#x27;s and she says it really worked well.  We don&#x27;t ge much sun so product like this work really well for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this as a cost-effective moisture boosting gel.</li>
    <li> This gel feels really nice when I put it on. It absorbs quickly, feels nice and cool, and doesn&#x27;t make a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am prone to extremely dry skin - dryer than most. I also live in a dry climate that is currently very cold, and none of this helps things. That said, I need a lot of this to make a noticeable difference, and I need to apply it often. I&#x27;ve found that three times a day really is the minimum, and even then my face has a dry patch or two. I had my mother try it, just to see how it worked for her, and she had much better results than me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that this is a good gel that will work for a lot of people, but it simply did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Having dry skin during winter can be frustrating because most moisturizers make the face more or less oily and if you are at a party where your picture is taken, you end up with a shiny face in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel solves the problem.  You get the moisture and hydration you need for your skin without the oily result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the portion is a little more generous.  However, I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great facial cleansing product by Neutrogena again. I have a combination skin that tends to get dry in the winters in the cheek area. Using the HydroBoost water gel was great for both the dry and oily area. It gave it enough &amp;#34;hydro boost&amp;#34; that lasted for 4-5 hours.</li>
    <li> I REALLY like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on with no scent, my skin sucks it right in. And unlike any other moisturizer type product I have used--my face feels absolutely great after I put it on. It feels really smooth and fresh--no sticky feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been going makeup free for several days, just using this after I wash my face in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem with it--is all mine, I open things at a tilt and some of it plopped right out the first time I opened it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would get this again and recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Love this gel!  It smells great, goes on without leaving any film/residue, and feels so refreshing.  This is perfect for the cold weather, when my skin gets dry and chapped easily--I just put this on after a shower and after washing my face and it lasts for the entire day.  I will definitely be picking this up again once this jar runs out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Hyaluronic Acid Serums and they have replaced all my other moisturizers.  They are the best because they go on clean, don&#x27;t clog pores, don&#x27;t have excess fragrances, absorb quickly, feed my skin, leaves no residue, and lightens my dark spots all in one.  I was excited to try this product and was severely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does not have much in common with the hyaluronic serums I&#x27;ve been using.  It&#x27;s thicker than serum, has blue coloring, has a stronger (yet pleasant fragrance), and leaves a residue on my hands.  It&#x27;s very, very slight - but it&#x27;s there.  The slippery residue on my hands takes about 10 minutes to go away.  It does do a good job moisturizing, but I really prefer the clean serums over this product that has extra chemicals in it like the blue coloring and the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is nice and the jar is very pretty with it&#x27;s light, clear blue appearance.  But it&#x27;s an open jar that you dip into to get the product.  Other products that I&#x27;ve bought that came in jars, they supplied a little plastic scoop of some sort so that you don&#x27;t have to use your finger to dip into the product.  This one does not supply that.  So unless you have a little scoop, you will have to resort to using your fingers.  Make sure your hands are clean, otherwise you can contaminate the product!  LOL  Maybe I&#x27;m the only one that thinks of these things - it&#x27;s probably not a big deal to most people - but I figured it was worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely prefer my serums and would not recommend this product over them.  If you&#x27;re used to heavy, cream moisturizers with artificial coloring and fragrances - this would seem to be a nice, light moisturizer in comparison.</li>
    <li> Makes your face and neck smooth and soft but only slightly more than a regular moisturizer.  The color of the gel is blue in the container, but it goes on clear.  The scent is relaxing though it disappears quickly.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel is a very smooth gel. It has a light floral aroma. It absorbs quickly and evenly. The color is more or less the color of the jar. It is not greasy. I&#x27;m not allergic to it and it hasn&#x27;t made me break out. The plastic jar is quite substantial. I think it works great.</li>
    <li> I have tried many lotions, creams and gels and I like this one very much. It goes and feels clean and refreshes the skin. Is as advertised, a nice hydro boost for skin.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel gives you a pleasant  little tingle when you first put it on your face and/or neck. The gel absorbs quickly and immediately removes that stretched and  tight feeling of dryness felt by those of us weathering winter in the Midwest. Your face will feel soft and nourished for about 6 hours with little or no feeling of stickiness. I have been using it twice a day....first thing when I wake up and right before bedtime and am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Light to the touch, pleasant scent, and seems to hydrate winter-worn skin nicely, this product is one I will definitely buy again. While I think aging skin is just that -- aging and therefore of a different texture than that of your people, it is definitely drier and needs a bit more lubrication/hydration to make it through the day, and this product provides that without making the skin greasy. It is light and seems to be quite effective, and the container is pretty on the bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> ditch the dye &amp; fragrence and you have a winner. The oil-free gel is a nice change from the light creams I use for my 50 year old fair skin. Wearable under my makeup (foundation and blush). The product looks gorgeous - so maybe as a gift from sister to sister or when you want to try a new product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can apply once or twice a day. After cleaning your face you can even apply a light lotion to enhance the effect of the Hydro Boost. At the end of the day you can repeat. I use a makeup sponge to apply or my finger tips when fresh from a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hyaluronic Acid and Olive Extract moisturizes which smooths your skin and reduces the appearance of wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is Purified Hyaluronic acid? In prescription strength it has been used to treat skin issues like eczema. In this priduct it is listed as the 14th ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingrediants: water, dimethicone, glycerin, dimeticone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer, phenoxyethanol, polyacrylamide, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, dimethiconol, C13-14 isoparaffin, dimethicone crosspolymer, chlorphenesin, carbomer, laureth-7, sodium hyaluronate, ethylhexylglycerin, fragrance, C12-14 pareth-12, sodium hydroxide, blue 1</li>
    <li> Winter arrives and the skin&#x27;s ability to retain moisture is dramatically challenged. I am always looking for a good moisturizer that is easy to apply, not greasy, and without a foul/strong smell. The Neutrogena product certainly seemed to be a good one. The company makes good, reasonably-priced products, so I was eager to try it. In shot, it feels great going on. A little dab will do ya really, it does not take much to get the benefit from this gel. Because it is winter, it goes on relatively cool, has a good scent, and provides good temporary moisture. This is my reason for the 4 star review. The moisture is just not sustainable over any extended time period. The publicity mentions something like 24 hours. But that just does not happen, particularly in the dry winter months....</li>
    <li> I saw this product when one of my fav actress said it helped her a lot, so i choose to purchase this product. when i got it in the mail i was excited. when i first used it was smell great and after a couple of use i noticed my pores are getting smaller like there about to vanish and i have large pores, my skin feels clean and healthy. i will be purchasing this again</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for two nights so far, but I love the way it feels on my skin. No grease. No feeling of a coating. It goes on smoothly and easily and leaves your skin feeling clean. I plan to buy more of this product; it is the best I have used.</li>
    <li> Update June 2015:&lt;br /&gt;I have continued using this product since my initial review in December, and now I have seen an improvement in fine lines and wrinkles. This product has definitely lived up to its promises with continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*******************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased with the performance of Neutrogena&#x27;s Hydro Boost Water Gel. Although I don&#x27;t find it does much to reverse fine facial lines and wrinkles, it does help my skin feel very soft and smooth. It also reduces the tightness of my dry skin so that my face feels more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within five minutes of application, I feel a noticeable difference in my skin texture. My face becomes soft, smooth, and the itchy dryness disappears. This lasts for several hours. The roughness on my cheeks is totally gone. Gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is light, somewhere between a gel and a cream. It is not stiff or gooey like a typical gel, and it does not feel greasy like a cream. I&#x27;ve never used anything quite like it. It doesn&#x27;t take much, and it dissolves completely within minutes. I love that there is no sticky residue and that it does not leave my skin shiny. My face &amp;#34;breathes&amp;#34; through it and does not get sweaty with minimal activity as with all other creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the unexpected benefits that I absolutely love is the effect on makeup application. I use a cream to powder one step compact, and if I use Hydro Boost first, it glides on smoothly and stays fresher throughout the day. No more dry or flaky powder patches. As I&#x27;ve aged I&#x27;ve noticed that foundations and powders tend to accentuate in my lines and wrinkles instead of covering them. Using Hydro Boost prevents this from happening. Maybe it is plumping them up a bit. Somehow it prevents the makeup from settles into the wrinkles and reduces the &amp;#34;Grand Canyon&amp;#34; affect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is sensitive, and I have to be careful what I use. Although I feel a very slight tingle when using this product, I&#x27;ve had no adverse affects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only have one gripe: why use colors and fragrances? I understand that the blue color reminds one of water, and it is a lovely shade, especially encased in the crystal clear blue glass container, but why add unnecessary coloring to such a great product? Also while the fragrance is very faint and vaporizes almost instantly when applied, why add it? The scent is vaguely familiar and pleasantly light, but again, totally unnecessary. I can barely detect faint notes of almond but am not sure of the rest. The combination of the light blue color and the pleasing scent is relaxing, so it fulfills its marketing purpose. I just would prefer they were not there.ances?

    <li> It does make my skin feel smooth and fresh after I use it but I do have very dry skin and that effect doesn&#x27;t last more than half hour so I have to use it again... It also makes my skin feel irritated while I&#x27;m applying it. I guess My skin is very sensitive, so far I have just found one moisturizer  in this price range that doesn&#x27;t does that to me... It was a mistake to &amp;#34;try&amp;#34; a new brand. It wasn&#x27;t bad. But didn&#x27;t really work wonders for me.</li>
    <li> This product is so awesome for my skin..my skin feels refreshed every time I use it.. it drys up quick and it has a good smell to it.. #BehindTheGlow</li>
    <li> I DONT NOW IF THE PRODUCT IS NEW OR NOT</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! It&#x27;s the very first moisturizer that I&#x27;ve ever used that works for my very oily skin. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all but it really moisturizes quite well. I get this on subscribe &amp; save and I adore it! Give it a shot if you&#x27;ve got oily skin. I keep it in he refrigerator and use it after cleansing my face morning &amp; night. Very Refreshing!!</li>
    <li> i have been using this for the past week  now an my skin is in love with it you cn use it day or night or when ever it smells great an it not leave your skin feeling sticky like most face products. its easy to use just apply with  your finger tips an your good to go.within mins of putting it on you can feel the difference in you skin,. I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Wow! This stuf feels amazing and fixed my super dry face from the brutal WI winter. I use it at night and my dry spots are gone after 4 nights. I&#x27;d prefer scent free but I don&#x27;t mind the light scent. I might try for day use but it doesn&#x27;t have any sunscreen. Try it!!</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel is a light but hydrating moisturizer.  It feels great going on my skin, and it absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft and hydrated but not at all sticky. My skin is left feeling fresh and clean. My makeup goes on nicely over the gel - it works as a primer of sorts. I would recommend Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel to anyone who could use an intense yet light moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product through Influenster in exchange for sharing my honest opinion of the product. Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
    <li> The rating this product gets from YOU may vary from my rating, and I’ll explain why. This particular moisturizer is water-based, rather than oil-based.  What does this mean? It means that it will absorb quickly, won’t leave a “film” on your face or make you feel greasy, and is not sticky.  Those are the pros. Basically it’s a great moisturizer for people who don’t need THAT much moisturizing.  If you have very dry skin, this product won’t be enough for you.  But if you have oily or combination skin, this product will be great.  My skin tends to be dry, so for the winter, this product doesn’t replenish my skin well enough, however it’s fine for the summer when my skin tends to be more oily. The product itself is a pretty pale blue color and is a gel format, easy to spread on. It does have a fairly powerful scent, but that dissipates quite fast. All in all, a reasonably priced moisturizer for those without very dry skin, or for summer use (put the moisturizer in the fridge and it will feel great going on in the hot weather). (***Testing &amp; Review by Ann Latner)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the neutrogena hydro boost water gel! My skin feels so soft and hydrated after using it. I like that it isn&#x27;t greasy and it is so light. This is the perfect product for the harsh winter we have had this year. Thanks to Influenster I was able to try it out for free and I definitely plan to continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> What can i say? This stuff is just awesome! I have very dry skin..im starting to get deep wrinkles at the age of 38. I have used creams, lotions, coconut oil etc but they all make me feel and look greasy. This moisturizer soaks in like pure water leaving no greasy residue. It gives me that dewy look of youth and is great even under makeup because its not heavy or oily. I love the texture of my skin, kind of like baby skin..new and fresh feeling..soft..velvety. I am also impressed with how long it lasts. A little goes a long way. If you&#x27;re looking for a deep moisture gel that feels weightless yet lasts all day this is the gel for you.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t a terrible product. It did not irritate my skin. However, it did not hydrate my skin as I had expected it to. I was still left with dry patches on my face. I have to use this product with other oils and serums to get enough hydration. I am disappointed but it might be fine for someone with mildly dry skin.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I did receive this product for free to try through influenster, but all these opinions are my own. I have dry to normal skin and am incredibly picky about how moisturizers dry on my skin. I can&#x27;t stand if they do not dry completely or leave any sort of residue. The Neutrogena Hydro Boost does not do that! It dries completely in seconds and leaves me skin feeling incredibly soft and smooth. I have been using the product for a little over a week and have seen a noticeable improvement in my skin. I can&#x27;t wait to try the other products in this line!</li>
    <li> New favorite! Super hydrating, fast absorbing, non oily, leaves skin smooth and hydrated. Smells lovely. Can&#x27;t say enough good things! It&#x27;s wonderful. I recieved this product compliments of Influenster for review purposes.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is super versatile - I love that I can put it on at night and get great hydration before bed, but also wear it during the underneath my makeup! The best part though is the texture of your skin after applying it. This made my skin feel incredibly soft! I&#x27;ll definitely be getting this again!</li>
    <li> I was given this free for the purpose of review by Influenster. The entire two weeks I&#x27;ve been testing it, I&#x27;ve also been sick with bronchitis, and my skin is hardly showing the signs you&#x27;d expect from not only being sick, but being on a strong antibiotic. In fact, my skin has never felt softer or more hydrated!</li>
    <li> Feels wonderful on your face.  Looks good and feels good all day.  I think it looks more natural than heavier moisturizers.  It is not at all greasy.  You can use it with Retinol because it has no oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great product.</li>
    <li> After more than 14 days of using Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel, I am very pleased. Initially, when I first cleaned my face and then applied this water gel, it absorbed very quickly into my skin. It was like my skin was a sponge and I didn&#x27;t see any moisture or glow. I have combination skin and have dry skin in certain areas of my face so I first used this product without applying makeup all day and went out on my errands. By the end of the first day, I noticed how my skin was actually glowing and had a calm, supple, appearance. The water gel definitely appeared to work from the inside out without making me look greasy. I also used this product with the my makeup application process and noticed that it did not conflict with that routine either. There was not too much moisture to conflict with my makeup. Ironically, I was finished with another moisturizer that I was trying until I found a permanent one, and then I was invited to test this Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel for free. I am glad that I had the opportunity to try it. I like it a lot and will continue to use it as my now permanent moisturizer. Although, I was invited to test Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel for free, this review is totally my opinion and my opinion alone.Your experience may vary.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Hydro Boost Water Gel for about two weeks now. My skin is typically oily, yet still dry in some areas due to be in the sun a lot. I have been looking for something to use at night that would help with the dryness, yet not make me even more oily or cause a breakout issue. So far I have noticed a huge difference in my skin. The dry spots are going away and I&#x27;m not breaking out like crazy, wooohoo!!! I put this on at night after a shower. It&#x27;s super light and a little goes a LONG way. It goes on nice and smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or make me feel &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34;. I wash it off in the morning and carry on with my normal routine.  I was sent Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel for free, but all opinions are mine. When I finish this jar I WILL be buying another!</li>
    <li> Love this, I use it as a moisturizer for my face after I cleanse it. It makes me feel refreshed and my skin absorbs it so fast. Has a nice soap-y smell to it, but doesn&#x27;t irritate me at all (and I have pretty sensitive skin). If your skin is very dry though I don&#x27;t think this would be work for you, its not oily so doesn&#x27;t moisturize much. I think its perfect for combination skin types.</li>
    <li> Good product to make your face feel cool and refreshed, It does not leave the skin feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! It applies in smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling afterwards. It dries perfectly into my freshly cleaned face. I&#x27;ve felt m face feel smoother since it bought this product!</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this moisturizer in my walmart beauty box and it was love at first try! I have oily/combination skin and it&#x27;s perfect for my skin. It absorbs so fast and leaves my skin looking matte. It smells wonderful! I love it so much!!! The shipping was super fast, I got it in 2 days! Will definintly be ordering again from amazon</li>
    <li> I love this product. It feels like liquid ice or it could just be subliminal. Anyway, it glides on so soft and absorbs into the face in seconds. No trace of anything. Leaves my face feeling so light and fresh. It has such a light tranquil scent when you first put in on but the scent fades so its nothing offensive or strong. My skin look like satin and stays that way throughout the day. I am hooked.</li>
    <li> I received this product for free to test from Influenster. At first I was so excited to try it given it is such a high value product, but I have to say that it has not lived up to my standards. First off, I have to say when it comes to skin care I am very particular about what I put on my face. I like natural products. I typically either use Argan or Tsubaki oil as a moisturizer on my face, which tends to be VERY dry in the winter and combination in the summer. My first impression of this product was that it was very thin. And my second, almost immediate impression was the heavy fragrance. It smelled literally like someone&#x27;s (bad) perfume. I don&#x27;t know why skincare companies have to put fragrance in their face products. If I were to use this in the morning and then eat breakfast all I can taste is the perfume from this product. The thin consistency is due to its water based formula that is packed full of dimethicone - which is a silicone and kind of sits on top of your skin and doesn&#x27;t get absorbed. For instance, silicones in hair products are bad because they cause build up. I was wary of these silicones and did not like the slick texture of this product. Additionally, it has Blue dye No. 1. Why? Why would Neutrogena put a synthetic dye in a face product? There is absolutely no need for that. When I used the product on freshly cleaned skin it did absorb but did not leave my skin feeling hydrated. In fact, you could still see some dry patches on it. I think that even though I did not particularly like this product, that someone with very oily skin would find it nice to use as a light moisturizer. For me, something with the word &amp;#34;hydro&amp;#34; in it should definitely have been more hydrating than it is. I think that Neutrogena has to come out with a fragrance free alternative for us customers with sensitivity to fragrance. It literally makes your eyes water. Even though I got this for free I do not recommend it nor do I I think I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I just received this wonderful Product in the mail from Influenster for free to review!! I have to say that I put this on about 10 minutes ago and my skin still feels amazing! It’s a very lightweight product and feels sort of like water.  It does not have any crazy smell to it. I have some acne on my skin right now and it did not bother it at all. I am very impressed with this product as I have always had a hard time finding something to hydrate my face and this does just that! I would definitely buy this product again and again! as again, I did get this product for free, but the opinion of this product is my own. :)</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product! I have very dry skin on my face. Since using this product my skin feels AMAZING! I highly recommend the neutrogena hydro boost! I tested the Neutogena Hydro Boost for free, but this opinion is my own. #BehindTheGlow #Infuenster</li>
    <li> Love the way this hydrates ! Best moisturizer I have found this Clinique&#x27;s dramaticly differnt moisturizing lotion! No oily feeling face since its water based! Definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> I am loving this gel... I normally don&#x27;t use moisturizers in my face since I have combination skin.. But when I was sent this product via influenster.com to review, I immediately was impressed... My skin feels supple but not oil. It&#x27;s water based which means of you have oily skin you&#x27;re not using more oil to moisturize.. I am loving this product. This product was sent to me by influenster.com to review.. But the opinions are true and honest.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve want to try this product since I first saw it on store shelves. I was very excited to try it when I received it as a sample compliments of Influenster. I absolutely loved it. I loved the way it instantaneously hydrated my skin. It is a great and cheaper solution for these cold winter days. It has been a great addition to my face routine and I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for anything. Loving this product. Thank you neutrogena and influenster.</li>
    <li> I am loving this product! Usually around this time of year my skin is very dry from the Cincinnati weather. This product has kept my product clean, fresh &amp; moisturised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was given to me to test by Influenster</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!! It makes my face feel great!😃😃😃😃</li>
    <li> This gel is light weight on the skin, quickly absorbed and has long lasting effects.  I wish I would have found this is the dead of winter because I really could have used the extra hydro boost then.  I&#x27;ve been using this in my nightly routine about 2-3 times a week and can see and feel a difference in the morning.  I particularly can see a difference in my under eye area which is almost plumped after using this.  Fine lines remain but overall my skin feels extra hydrated and soft.  I&#x27;m surprised how long this feeling remains even after going without a two nights in a row.  The gel is cooling and refreshing when applied.</li>
    <li> Tried this out today, it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. Very lightweight. And my skin feels instantly hydrated! Soft too! No strong fragrance. I wonder about *some* of the ingredients, prefer all natural, but it really makes my skin feel great! I got to try it for free, but be ensured my review is completely honest! I recommend it esp in the winter time!</li>
    <li> I got this as a free sample via influenster to test. I really enjoyed it! I thought it was very light, but lasted a long time. It is more liquid than other lotions (because it&#x27;s a gel) and I accidentally spilled some the first time I opened it (which was my fault), so be careful!</li>
    <li> I prefer a little more oil base in my facial moisturizer.  So, I am a little skeptical to use it often.  I do use it at least once a week.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of Neutrogena products so I am not new to this brand. I have been using their facial cleanser for years and people always comment on how great my skin looks, so I didn&#x27;t think there would be any problem with this product. I used this product immediately after washing my face with the facial cleaner. I absolutely love the smell, texture, lightweight and smoothness of this product. It&#x27;s not sticky at all and you can&#x27;t even tell its on your face once you rub it in. Unlike other products I have tried that leave my face looking oily or greasy this one doesn&#x27;t! So far I love everything about this product expect that now my face is breaking out which usually happens whenever I introduce a new neutrogena product into my regimen. I think after a few more uses I will end up buying this product from now on! I also tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free thanks to Influenster, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this about 2 hours after using my Influenster Neutrogena® Hydro Boost Water Gel with hyaluronic acid and I must say that my skin is still super soft and springy. My T-zone is normally really dry and cracked especially during winter and especially since I&#x27;ve been sick lately, but at this point my skin is so smooth, my fingers feel like they&#x27;re gliding over my face. I&#x27;m super happy with the immediate results, and even now it still have that fresh washed face feeling that I had when I first applied it. I highly recommend for people with super dry skin like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Product featured was received free to test and review by Influenster.</li>
    <li> This Gel is as good as the one Clinique makes but much cheaper.</li>
    <li> I was able to try and test a jar of Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions expressed are my own.  I  received this awhile back and wanted to  use it for several weeks to see what it really does. I was suitable impressed as it did indeed hydrate my skin by week two of using the product  My skin actually felt dry to the touch and I  could not wait to apply this to my skin.  It was not oily or greasy to touch and went on rather smoothly.  I would have preferred it to have no scent but I can deal with it. ANd now a MONTH LATER i CAN ATTEST THAT IT HAS INDEED MADE MY SKIN FEEL SMOOTH AND SOFTER.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the way my skin feels after applying the gel.  I have only been using it for a couple weeks so, of course, there is nothing dramatic and being a realistic senior I am not expecting miracles.</li>
    <li> I never realized how thirsty the skin on my face was until I started using Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel! This is the first product that I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve used hundreds!) that I actually felt work instantly. My skin literally absorbed the Hydro Boost Gel instantly and didn&#x27;t leave any stickiness or residue behind. By the next morning, my face was so smooth I actually told my husband that it felt &amp;#34;As smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!&amp;#34; and I wasn&#x27;t exaggerating! This stuff is the closest I&#x27;ve ever come to witnessing a miracle. If you have any doubts, try it for yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are my own!</li>
    <li> I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are my own...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not expecting much when I received this moisturizer, But I am so glad I got to try this item!! I have tried sooo many moisturizers and none have really helped with my dry skin. I thought that it being water-based it wasnt going to do much. I was wrong! This leaves my skin so soft! I love using it in the morning before I go to work or a few minutes before I put my makeup on. I highly recommend this, I will definitely buy this on my own!</li>
    <li> I live in Colorado and I swim quiet frequently in an indoor pool here... needless to say my skin is DRY and ITCHY a lot of the time. This has been the best thing I have used on my face/neck for this problem to date. I don&#x27;t feel oily or that I&#x27;m hurting my skin with this product at all. I love it, plus it&#x27;s made my skin look better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are your own.</li>
    <li> Just started using this water gel but so far I really love it! It makes my normally extremely dry skin feel so soft and moisturized without making me break out! The texture is a bit weird at first and feels like it&#x27;s going to drip off your fingers, but you get used to it after a few uses. Definitely recommend it to anyone else with chronically dry and sensitive skin like mine.</li>
    <li> I received the Hydro Boost Water Gel from Influenster for testing purposes and I&#x27;m super glad I was chosen for this campaign.  I have the hardest time finding moisturizers for my face.  My skin is dry and sensitive and a lot of products leave my skin feeling greasy and sticky.  This water gel is AMAZING!  It goes on so smooth and easy, my skin absorbs it entirely within 30 secs to a minute and there is no greasy or sticky residue.  I can put my pressed powder makeup on over it and it goes on smooth without making it look heavier.  My skin feels so smooth and soft.  It has a very light pleasant scent and it&#x27;s cool to the touch when applying.  I will definitely be purchasing this on my own once I run out.  Can&#x27;t wait to try the rest of this line!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  2 people asked me if I was using something different on my face just weeks after I started using it.  I have told family and friends about it and they are now using it too.</li>
    <li> I do have sensitive skin. This product states it is for all skin types and is non comedogenic (won&#x27;t cause breakouts)  I read about water based moisturizers in a magazine, and this particular one was mentioned, so I looked for it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied it to my forehead only,  to make sure it was an OK product for me.  This was prior to going to bed in the evening. The smell was strong, and reminded me of some type of &amp;#34;ocean breeze&amp;#34; scented air freshener. I did not care for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once on my skin, my face felt a bit of a sting. I went to sleep and woke up with a forehead covered in bumps.  A nightmare breakout! I am quite disappointed. I will have to look into returning this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may work for some, but I would never want to put this on my face again. I csnnot tell if my skin is softer, as it feels too broken out to tell.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! My skin feels fresh and moisturized all day! I even had my husband use the product on his dry skin and the Hydro Boost helped make his skin smooth and fresh over night! YES, OVERNIGHT!&lt;br /&gt;I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> My first impression was that the &amp;#34;water gel&amp;#34; is definitely more water than gel, it has kind of a runny consistency which made me hesitant because thicker products are usually more hydrating in my experience. The second thing that I noticed was the scent, this product has a clean scent that almost reminds me of laundry detergent or a clean linen scent, which I love... but not on my face. The blue color was also somewhat off putting because I&#x27;m not a fan of added dyes to skin care products, they don&#x27;t seem to irritate me (they can for some people) but it just seems unnecessary.  When I used this product (on a fresh clean face of course) it immediately absorbed into my skin and felt very light, not greasy and had a semi matte finish. After about 5-10 minutes my skin feels like the product is completely absorbed and gone and my face starts to get that tight dry feeling like I never put anything on it. I tried using this moisturizer several times and always ended with the same result I needed something heavier on top to keep my skin hydrated for more than 10 minutes. I tend to love products with hyaluronic acid but after checking the ingredients list and seeing how far down on this list HA was in this product, 15 out of 20 (just slightly above fragrance, and the blue dyes), I&#x27;m not surprised my skin didn&#x27;t really feel its effects.  I was sent this product to review, opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I recently received the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel to test free for free. I have had dry skin my entire life, so of course I was hesitant about another product. Finding a product that helps with moisture is never easy. Here are my own personal thoughts on the product. From the moment I opened the container I knew I would love the product. I wish I could bottle the smell as a perfume. It smells amazing!! It smells like a day spa. I also love how it feels on my face. It&#x27;s light, but has a nice cooling, moisturizing feeling. I definitely recommend this product for people with dry skin.</li>
    <li> I was super excited to try this! I love Neutrogena&#x27;s products, and have used their cleansers and moisturizers for years. Upon opening the package, I immediately got the product all over my hands - it is not exactly gel, but almost a thick liquid! The smell is next to nonexistent, so good thing for sensitive noses and skins, but next was the application. I used barely a pea size and it felt as though it would never soak in! I have usually combination skin, but by the end of the day my skin is dry and almost scaly - and I&#x27;ve begun to break out on my temples and forehead. Usually my chin is the problem spot, but for some reason this Gel isn&#x27;t sitting well with me. I&#x27;m bummed, because I really love the products normally but I&#x27;ll have to give this one the boot. I received the Hydro Boost from Influenster VoxBox to try and review for free, but wasn&#x27;t given anything to say - this is just my opinion!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I am so happy i got a chance to try it. MY skin is extremely dry everyday when i wake up, i started to use Neutrogena Hydro Boost and gradually i woke up with amazing skin. This product has a very light feel which is great and did not make my skin oily. I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I received this as part of Influenster &amp; I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting to like it. I have sensitive skin &amp; not a lot of products agree with me. However, this is one that I really like! It feels so good on my skin &amp; really feels like it&#x27;s giving my skin some serious love in the moisture department!</li>
    <li> I have been trying the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel for free for the last week! My opinion of the moisturizer- you can instantly feel the moisture soak in to your skin. I use it twice a day and it has replaced my moisturizer &amp; serum combo I was using. So happy to find something that puts moisture where needed without feeling oily!</li>
    <li> I struggled between giving this an &amp;#34;It&#x27;s Okay&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;I Like It&amp;#34;.  I was so very excited to try this product because it guaranteed moisture to my skin (which I SO desperately needed the last month or so - let&#x27;s just say MI weather is a jerk to my skin) and the product does give you the hydration that you are looking for but not as long as you would hope it would.  I normally use this in the morning before putting on my make up and my skin feels AMAZING but 2-3 hours later (after I have been outside and commuted to work) I do not feel like my skin is a hydrated as the hydro boost water gel guarantees.  I also struggle a bit with the smell - for a product that is supposed to be so hydrating you would think it would smell like fresh water? Not so much... Smells like my grandmas perfume that had been sitting in the bottle for WAY too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the product does hydrate your skin very well  - just not as long as you would like for it to.  I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free through Influenster, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I live in the California desert weather where it is extremely cold and extremely hot. Really there is no happy medium. I have to carry moisturizer in both seasons, but especially in the winter. I have combination skin and in the summer where my mouth and nose area tends to dry and peel. In the winter, the same areas tend to be tight and itchy along with my chin and cheekbone area. Needless to say, I have all sorts of moisturizers. I am in love with the fact that I do not need to reapply this gel multiple times throughout the day. I apply the Neutrogena Gel once in the morning and once in the evening after I have washed my face. That is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I apply the Hydro Boost Water Gel my skin immediately feels refreshed, smooth, and vibrant. To date, this is the only product that has made me feel like this on first application and with no side effects. It absorbs quickly into my skin and my face is not extra shinny, it does not burn, and it is not greasy. All positive factors in my book. My skin is no longer itchy, tight, red, or peeling. I have somewhat sensitive skin and I feared the interaction between the chemicals in this product and ProActiv. To my surprise there was no reaction, no worsening or peeling of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it and am shocked that it did not have the same results for others. On the positive side for these folks it that there is Hydro Boost Gel-Cream for Extra Dry Skin! I will be purchasing the Hydro Boost Gel Eye Cream....hopefully this has fantastic results for me also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received and tested this product for free from Influenster. This review is my honest and personal views after testing the product for 3 weeks. I am hooked and I can honestly say that I will continue to use this in the winter....and hopefully in the summer as well. We will see how that goes as I haven&#x27;t had the pleasure to test this product in the summer.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin and eczema. Since I&#x27;ve introduced this product to my daily skin routine, I haven&#x27;t noticed any dry patches. My skin feels completely hydrated and smooth. I feel I look more youthful with proper hydration.</li>
    <li> First off, I received this free as part of a trial. Second, it may make your face soft, but it takes chemically created ingredients to do it. It burned my face and eyes about 5 minutes after applying and I barely got close to the orbital bone, then after about 30 minutes I simply had to wash it off because the overly pungent fragrance made me sick to my stomach and is not at all necessary. I love the concept, I do, but I&#x27;m not going to put God knows what on my face to get there. I threw it away, I wouldn&#x27;t even give this full jar to friends or family.</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of Neutrogena products and this hydro gel is no exception. I really like the way it smells and the way it is absorbed by my skin. I do feel that in particularly dry areas (i.e. my nose) it is not as effective. However that being said, the more I use it the more it tends to be working! My favorite things about the hydro gel is how quickly I can apply my makeup afterwards. My only wish is that it contained some SPF in it. My makeup does, but for products used on my face my attitude toward SPF is the more the merrier! I would purchase this product in the future.&lt;br /&gt;I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost for free but all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> This Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel is said to instantly quench skin and keep it looking smooth, supple and hydrated day after day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is Oil-Free, Non-comedogenic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just apply evenly to face and neck after cleaning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes in a big 1.7 oz (48g) container&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Anyone who has been to my blog before knows that I normally would like to go for more natural products. They tend to break my sensitive skin out less and cause less irritation altogether. This being my first time being chosen to review an item from Influenster I was super excited because I found out that it was a Hyaluronic Acid product and you all know how much I love those!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited that I actually did the unboxing and thought I was filming and then come to find out I wasn&#x27;t and had to redo it. Here is my unboxing video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try this product for a few weeks and didn&#x27;t have any breakouts with it. It is a really watery gel. I&#x27;m not sure I like the container, I much rather have a pump style container because I don&#x27;t like germs especially when applying something on your face and around your eyes. I just made sure I washed my hands before dabbing around inside there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell even though it was really hard for me to describe. It smells really watery and fresh. VERY pleasant for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product absorbs super fast and leaves your face really soft and supple. I fount when using this product before applying makeup it would help the makeup with coverage and smooth out the surface for better coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really liked this product, Though I would probably still stick with my more natural approach I have going on with the current products I use, I would definitely recommend it to others. It does exactly what it says it will do on the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you found this review to be useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product free in a VOXBOX to share my honest opinion about it.&lt;br /&gt;@Neutrogena @Influenster #BehindTheGlowee in a VOXBOX to share my honest opinion about it.&lt;br /&gt;@Neutrogena @Influenster #BehindTheGlow</li>
    <li> The product is cooling &amp; soothing but doesn&#x27;t seem to have any significant moisturizing effect. I would not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I have fairly dry skin, so skin moisturizers are very important to me and I&#x27;m always eager to try the latest and greatest thing.  I received a pot of Neutrogena&#x27;s water gel in a beauty subscription box, and hoped it would be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed as I opened the pot was the fragrance.  It has a very fresh, clean scent - the sort of perfume that would be sold under a name like &amp;#34;Cool Water&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Tranquility&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s strong enough that I can smell the cream as it soaks in, but after thirty seconds or so the scent has dissipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel absorbs into the skin very quickly, and afterwards my skin smooth and soft.  The sensation doesn&#x27;t last long, however.  After an hour or so, my skin starts to get that tight, itchy feeling that dry skin has when it is utterly out of moisture, and I have to reapply.  So if you have dry skin, and especially if you have very dry skin, this product will not perform well for you.  For myself, I would only rate it one or two stars because even when used as a mid-day &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34; to the skin, it just doesn&#x27;t have any sort of lasting effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for a friend with oily skin, this was a satisfactory product.  She didn&#x27;t see any long-term effect to her skin, but appreciated that it gave a little moisture boost without leaving her skin feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> Unusual product. Absorbed quickly, not greasy and leaves my skin feeling ultra silky and soft all day.</li>
    <li> Love it! Not greasy. I have rosacea and oil products are not recommended.</li>
    <li> The Beauty of this gel is that you can apply is as base and it makes yours feel hydrated, and when you apply your regular moisturizer on top, it does not feel like it is too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently was in warmer weather and I can honestly say that this item saved me from peeling as much i typically would have  otherwise. Since I also live in cold weather and since winter does not seem to want to go away... i did notice that it help keep my skin more hydrated than if i used my moisturizer alone.&lt;br /&gt;It is a lightweight skin product that does what it says is does, and it makes you feel more hydrated.  It is strongly advised that you accompany this product with your regular moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Very smooth going on and you only need the smallest amount to cover your whole face. It lasts all day and smells fresh not chemically by mid day when touching my face it feels very soft</li>
    <li> This product is Amazing! I have super dry skin, especially with the current weather it&#x27;s making it even harder to keep my skin fresh. The day I got hydro boost water gel I immediately put it on. Instantly my skin felt hydrated and super smooth! The dryness was gone, and it didn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky at all. So I proceeded to out it on my boyfriend and my mother because they couldn&#x27;t understand why I was so excited! And they both loved it too! This is seriously a product I have been waiting for, and I am so glad I can use it daily to keep my skin fresh and moisturized!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer!!!!! It feels cool going on,  not heavy at all.  It does have a slight scent,  but it is definitely not overly so. My skin feels so soft!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it!  I have always had very good looking skin even with in being &amp;#34;oily skin.&amp;#34;, even into my into my sixties!  Didn&#x27;t think acne ! 40. For the past 2 years, my skin changed and I was shocked to realize it dulll &amp; dry. This stuff made a my skin feel fab but firm. No love touching my face.  It&#x27;s only been five days of use twice a day..  Good price too!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about two weeks and it is amazing so far. I have very oily skin, and I love how this product does not leave a sticky, greasy feeling on my face. It absorbs so fast and it feels so smooth. My face doesn&#x27;t look shiny afterwards and it doesn&#x27;t feel like I have any actual product on my face, which I love. Overall, this has been amazing for me, especially during the summer!</li>
    <li> This product is super great for oily skin to replenish moisture.  If you have dry skin, it would be too light.</li>
    <li> This burned my skin.  Later the batch I was sent was recalled.  I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Very nice product...non greasy or sticky feeling...will order again.</li>
    <li> I use it at night as a moisturizer before I go to bed after washing my face and applying some toner. It has a subtle, delightful fragrance and it really smoothes and moisturizes my face. It leaves it feeling super clean and healthy feeling. I&#x27;ve been having dry skin recently, and it does a good job of keeping my face hydrated.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product from Influenster and first off let me tell you it smells amazing! I have dry/combination skin and this feels like silk going on. I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times so we will see how it goes in the long run but for now I am pleased! It&#x27;s really hard for me to find something that gives enough moisture without feeling greasy and this product does it for me! Yay!!</li>
    <li> This product is great as a moisturizer for my combo skin. At first, I only used a thin layer (as I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would hold up on my skin), but my skin quickly sucked it up. I put on a little thicker layer next time and it absorbed perfectly! Note: This is a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; so it is a little thinner than most creams.  The jar it comes in isn&#x27;t the best packaging for my little hands and I&#x27;ve dropped it numerous times. Be sure not to store this on its side, for when you open it, it will spill out (Happened to me a couple times). That being said- this product is great and light and the smell is not overpowering. Highly recommend this product. I received this product free to review but the opinions and comments above are 100% true and accurate.</li>
    <li> Hydro Boost water gel has become my absolute favorite! I use it immediately after I shower &amp; it makes my face feel so silky smooth. I love it. It is not too thick or too watery. It is light weight &amp; smells so refreshing. It is a great product for the winter, so I think it will be equally amazing in the Summer.&lt;br /&gt;(I was given this product complimentary but review is of my own true opinion)</li>
    <li> I love  this moisturizer. Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel has left my skin feeling smooth and moisturized.  During this time of the year my skin gets dry from being inside all day with the heat running.  The heat dries out my skin so bad.  It is a constant struggle to keep it  moisturized.  This product has helped reduce the patches of dry flaky skin.  I would like to thank Influenster for sending me this product to test for free.  I will continue to buy this product once my sample runs out.</li>
    <li> Great product for moisturizing. I use it at same time as Lumere Vitamin C  BB serum. Best results I&#x27;ve ever had with any products even those that cost much more!</li>
    <li> As I have combination skin I always look for a cream that is less oily still gives hydration to the skin. I am using this water gel for the first time and liking it so far.</li>
    <li> finally a face cream where I can tell the difference. Not sticky, gives me a glow, helps smooth out redness.  Just a nice moisturizer. No spf though. Will continue to buy on subscribe and save and add to my daily and nightly routine.</li>
    <li> I recently received this to try.  I normally have dry skin due to facial cleansers, been on a search to find a facial moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin shiny/oily.  I was pleasantly surprised by this product, my skin is close to matte with this product.  The fragrance is a bit strong, could do without the fragrance, but it&#x27;s not overpowering.  A little goes a long way!   Doesn&#x27;t interfere with my makeup routine, can apply make up right after application without my face feeling weighed down.  Will purchase in the future!</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin, and usually I have to choose between either letting it stay dry or letting it feel greasy by applying coconut oil in abundance -- up until now, that was the only thing that would relieve my dry skin. I received this gel to test (for free), and I&#x27;ll admit, I was skeptical at first. Having tried other similar products by different brands (who shall remain nameless), I didn&#x27;t expect this product to be any different. I was wrong. This gel actually alleviated my dry skin, without leaving an oily or filmy residue. It also left my skin feeling refreshed and hydrated. And unlike other brands, Neutrogena Hydro Boost actually smells good -- it doesn&#x27;t have a chemical smell, but rather it has a light, pleasing aroma. If you have dry skin, give this product a try. It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gel for a little over a week now. While it is nice enough as moisturizers go, I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s my favorite and I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be turning to it again in the future. Yes, it makes a go at keeping my normal skin moisturized all day, I struggle with a lingering greasy feeling for up to an hour after application, despite a very modest usage. I like the clean scent, and yes, it does moisturize as promised, but not as well as other products I&#x27;ve tried. Good effort, but not the best.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for so many years... Probably around 8 years. It was only available in Asia before and I am not sure why Neutrogena didn&#x27;t offer it in the USA. Most moisturizers in the USA are too heavy for summer and I had a difficult time to find something lighter in drugstores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, speaking as a user of this product for 8 years, this is a great product for the summer, when the humidity is relatively high. Usually I apply twice on my face and it&#x27;s good to go. Quick absorption. Not sticky. It&#x27;s not enough for me during the winter, but I use it as the &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; before applying richer moisturizer. Also I use it to moisturize my skin before putting on makeup.</li>
    <li> Man I love this stuff, its so much better than any cream I&#x27;ve every used! I will always re-order!</li>
    <li> I saw the commercial for this and decided to give it a shot. My skin tends to be dry which causes peeling/flaking. Which is dumb because the rest of my face is oily.There&#x27;s nothing worse than having oily skin with dry spots. I&#x27;ve tried everything from coconut oil to various lotions. I used this hydro boost gel and after the first use I was stunned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs really fast since it&#x27;s water based. It hydrates really well, but since it&#x27;s oil free your face stays clean. No shine! It tingles a bit and leaves your face feeling so fresh and clean. It literally makes your skin look beautiful. To other people it may just be just be another moisturizer but to me this is a life changer. To finally have the confidence to take a closeup selfie is amazing.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product with the intention of possibly replacing my Clinique  gel moisturizer. Unfortunately, the Neutrogena Hydro Boost caused an allergic reaction and now I&#x27;m walking around with a red, swollen face.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this product because it contains hyaluronic acid for my aging, combination skin. I really like the silky feel of this moisturizer and the fact that it is absorbed by the skin quite quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling. I wear it under foundation or alone and the moisture seems to last all day; I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see lasting results but I can see this becoming my daily moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I use this product as a nighttime moisturizer on my combination skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff leaves my face feeling amazing! The best description I can give for how my face feels after application is dewy and that&#x27;s a good thing! It feels so wonderful and does my face wonders!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different moisturizers on my face, and while many of them make a difference, at least when I use them consistently, very few actually leave me really happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena&#x27;s Hyrdo Boost Water Gel makes me happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I didn&#x27;t notice a scent, unless I really stuck my nose up next to the jar and sniffed.  When I&#x27;m just putting it on my face, I don&#x27;t notice it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I&#x27;m at that menopausal stage of life, which means I have very dry skin on much of my face, but huge outbreaks of acne on my chin.  My chin is always dry too, and no, I can&#x27;t explain it.  When I first used the Hydro Boost, I avoided my chin.  I put the gel onto my cheeks, around my eyes, on my forehead... and it just soaked in quickly and left my skin feeling cool and smooth.  Like I had just given it a drink of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of days, I tried it on my chin too, and have been doing so ever since.  The acne isn&#x27;t any worse, and in fact, my chin feels healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes... something I can put on my whole face that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, just light and fresh.  It&#x27;s a winner in my book.</li>
    <li> I love this product &amp; only wished it came in a larger size.  I lavish it on my face &amp; neck where it is completely, rapidly absorbed.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for 2 weeks now and find that  each day I have noticed a softness and my  fine lines are not as noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; And stay that way much loner than my usual moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using my regular moisturizer and now just use Neutrogena Hydro Gel and like the softness and boost of a younger looking  complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. I tend to shy away from moisturizers because I have oily acne prone skin, but some of the acne products I use will create rough patches. The first day I used this I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my face because it was so soft. It wasn&#x27;t greasy or heavy at all. It soaked right in and smelled wonderful. Almost like an ocean type scent that&#x27;s very faint. By the third day or so my skins condition improved quite a bit. The pores were looking much smaller and my face just had a natural glow. It also looked less tired and sunken in around the eyes. I simply cannot say enough about this.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It is extremely lightweight to the point of a water-type gel consistancy. I have never experienced a moisturizer like this before that was so lightweight but so hydrating.  This is suitable enough for me to use morning and night (although I do pair a heavier cream ontop of this at night before I sleep) and I have experienced absolutly no breakouts using this product. Moistrizers are very hard for me to find with my picky and stubborn acne prone combo-oily skin. This is definitly a HG product for me.  This product does contain fragrance, but I find that it disappears quickly after application.  The only sugguestion I have for this product is that I believe it would be better packaged in a squeez or pump tube. I find that is is very easy to get too much product in a jar, and I also have sanitation issues in mind.  Edit: 12/30/15  Contamination has been an issue with this product. Where it is in a tub it has slowly, over the last several months, become contaminated. I believe this is the cause of a major forehead breakout I recently experienced!  Even using a spatula, this could not be avoided.  This really could be a great product, but oh how I wish they had it in a pump bottle!</li>
    <li> Seriously love this!!!! I generally have more oily skin, but my forehead gets so dry and flaky and I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that will take care of that, while still being light enough for the rest of my face to handle. Enter perfection in the form of Neutrogena Hydro Boost. It makes my skin so soft and smooth all day, while not making it excessively greasy. It&#x27;s been the best thing I&#x27;ve found for my face in a long time - maybe ever.</li>
    <li> I did like the way it moisturized my face but after a few days my face broke out.  I use it every so often and have had no more problems.</li>
    <li> I recently received this product and tested it for free and I will definitely be buying it when my first jar runs out! It smells fantastic and really made my face feel moisturized and refreshed. It did this without feeling greasy or heavy, which is always a concern of mine. The only downside is that it is going to run out fast because my husband loves it too!</li>
    <li> So far so good. I finished the jar. (It lasted for about a month). It really hydrates my skin. It replaced my high priced Hydramucine Creme. The only drawback is that I still have to use another cream that has spf. But my skin is moistured and smooth which says a lot because we are in the middle of an ARCTIC Winter.</li>
    <li> I am new to this product, but so far loving it! I&#x27;ve become much more aware of what&#x27;s in my products the older I get and avoiding synthetic oils whenever possible. The hydro boost water gel is water based, very light, the scent isn&#x27;t cloying and it absorbed into my skin right away. Even better, there was no film left behind, irritation or feeling of tightness afterwards. My skin immediately felt some relief, even in the midst of this ridiculous (and drying) Northeast winter we&#x27;re having. I think this would feel so good after being in the summer-time sun too-- it&#x27;s rare to find a product that can withstand big changes in temp, but this may be it. Give it a whirl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Disclosure: I was provided a complimentary product for review purposes, but all opinions are entirely my own.**</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely loving Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel! I did recieve it complementary for testing purposes however my love for this product is 100% real! I&#x27;ve never found a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin at least slightly greasy, but this one does not at all! My skin feels hydrated and refreshed, without any heavy or greasy feeling. The scent is light and fresh and really makes you feel pampered when using it.  I&#x27;m definitely a huge fan and will be buying another jar once this one runs out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I&#x27;ve had to keep it hidden from my husband bc he loves it too!</li>
    <li> goes on smooth and makes skin feel nice. I got this free to try from influenster and I have to say its one of my favorite things they sent me</li>
    <li> This product looks, smells and feels amazing! The packaging is lovely as well. I tried it today after washing my face using my face brush and Neutrogena clear pore cleanser. My skin drank it up! My face was smooth and felt like silk! Would definitely recommend this to others and can&#x27;t wait to see how continued perfects my skin. Thanks to @influenster @influenstervoxbox and @neutrogena for sending me this product! #BehindTheGlow #neutrogena #contest</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff!  It has a tingle when first applied but the sinks in and is not at all greasy.  It smells great and hydrates without causing breakouts.  Wish I had this earlier in the winter as it had gotten rid of the flaky spots I get in the dry Iowa winters.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena products from acne on the spot to sunscreen lotions since I was a teenager. I got a chance to try the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel and it has so many pros: affordable, easy to use, refreshing with a light fragrance, lightweight to easily absorb in the face and neck -- keeps the skin hydrated &amp; smooth, and oil-free (won&#x27;t leave a “film” on your face or make you feel greas). I would recommend mainly for spring/summer time.</li>
    <li> I love using this Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel! After I wash my face at night and pat my face dry, I use this water gel product on my skin. It feels amazing on my face. It dries pretty quickly and leaves my face feeling hydrated without being or feeling oily! (It smells great too and is not overwhelming). For the rest of the night my face feels smooth and healthy. I definitely recommend trying this product, I don&#x27;t think anyone would regret using it. I used this product for free but it has no bearing on my review of the product.</li>
    <li> I think the scent is amazing!  The texture of the product is a gel and very smooth.  The product is easy to go onto the skin and absorbs into the skin almost instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I however do not think the product sticks with me very long.  It is a breath of fresh air when you put the product on but I wish that breath stayed with me longer.  I am 36 years old so my skin is not what it used to be.  I do need to use the product longer to give it more of a chance but right now I am neutral on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive his product for free for testing purposes however that has no bearing on my review of this product.</li>
    <li> I use this two times a day.  Right after I wash my face in the morning and right after I get out of the shower at night.  I have extremely sensitive skin and it gets very dry especially during winter time.  This product feels amazing on the skin and definitely left my skin feeling hydrated!  I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free from influenster and I was hesitant to try at first due to my sensitive skin.  However, the gel did not leave my skin feeling irritated at all!  I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for something to hydrate their skin based on my personal experience.&lt;br /&gt;*This review is based on my personal experience and my own opinions.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using a gel instead of a cream moisturizer and I was extremely surprised at how effective this product is! I was immediately impressed with the light fragrance and cool feeling that it provided on my skin. I did not have to use much and my skin was instantly well moisturized and smooth. I love how fast it absorbed and didn&#x27;t leave any kind of residue and the benefits lasted all day. I&#x27;ve been using this product for several weeks now and I have been recommending it to everyone I know! It works even better than the $50 cream I&#x27;ve been using for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I did receive this product for free from influenster for testing purposes but the opinions above are all my own--I love this product and I&#x27;m so glad I tried it!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! At first the look and texture was unexpected but I love the color and feel of it. It instantly moisturizes your skin and you can see the moisture immediately. The directions say to use on your face and neck but I have been using it on my arms as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m testing this product thanks to Influenster.</li>
    <li> I was sent this product to test out from Influenster and I&#x27;m really glad I got to try it out. The Neutrogena Hydroboost water gel is a gel moisturizer that claims to instantly quench skin and provide moisture day after day. It contains hyaluronic acid, olive extract, and glycerin. Upon first use, the moisturizer is very wet feeling. It does take a few seconds to really absorb into the skin. While its absorbing, it leaves the skin feeling cool and refreshed. After it is fully absorbed, you don&#x27;t feel it at all (some gel moisturizers still feel sticky). I have combination oily skin so I&#x27;m not sure that this will be all that beneficial in the summer months but it was definitely a godsend for my dryer skin in the winter.I was sent this product to test for free from Influenster but all opinions of the product are my own.</li>
    <li> After a face mask this weekend, I needed some additional moisturizer. The winter has admittedly been a little rough on my skin, especially my poor, dry cheeks. I am so used to lotions and creams, so it was a different feel to use a gel. It was immediately cooling on my face, which felt very good, especially post-mask. Most importantly, it wasn&#x27;t at all irritating as I find many products are. I did notice my skin feeling significantly more hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I was nervous about this product when I first received it from Influenster, but it has quickly become a favorite.&lt;br /&gt;The gel leaves my face smooth without being tacky and allows me to move on with my makeup unlike other moisturizers that require drying time.&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks and feels softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy I have this and a little goes a long way so it will last a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I also received this product for free through my relationship with Influentster, all opinions are my own. Although I got this as a free trial, I will honestly say that this product is quite nice. The only cons are that it is a little pricey for me and not very thick for the winter months. However, the silky feel of the water gel is so refreshing! I love that it has a nice calming smell so I&#x27;ve been using it at night after I wash my face. I wake up with smooth skin and I can then use my regular moisturizer with spf in the morning. However going to sleep with this calm smell has been really nice.</li>
    <li> The Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Water Based - Good for people with allergies&lt;br /&gt;Goes on light&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin feeling smooth and soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Water Based - (a pro too, I know) - I have to put this on twice a day to really keep my skin from feeling super tight and dry, however the weather in Los Angeles has been really dry, so that might just be me.&lt;br /&gt;Feels like it might wear off more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m having a good experience with this product. It leaves my skin feeling nice and soft. I like that it doesn&#x27;t really feel like I&#x27;m wearing anything at all and doesn&#x27;t affect how my makeup goes on in a negative way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel compliments of Influenster for testing purposes; all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I normally have combination skin.  At 8 months into pregnancy, my skin is more unpredictable than ever. That is why when I had the opportunity to give Neutrogena’s Hydro Boost Water Gel a try, I was excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within moments of apply this product to my face I had a noticeable different in the texture of my skin. My rough texture on my jaw line was gone, leaving my face smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying it was a breeze.  It has a different type of consistency similar to that between a cream &amp; a gel but without the sticky texture of gel or the greasy feeling of some creams.  It did not make my skin “shine” with leftover residue, instead it provides a natural “glow”.  (I’ve finally gotten the “pregnancy makes you glow!” comments.  I’m not afraid to share my little secret that pregnancy has nothing to do with it!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are of my own.  I will be continuing to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> As someone with combo skin and acne prone, it&#x27;s hard to find a product that both moisturizes well and doesn&#x27;t clog pores (believe me I&#x27;ve tried them all). I&#x27;ve used pure hyalauronic acid, the magic moisturizing ingredient in this, in the past and it didnt absorb well. But years of harsh acne treatments have left my skin weak, red, and sensitive, and I was desperate for some hydration. After all the good reviews I tried this. What attracted me was that hyalauronic acid works by binding to water, and I liked the idea of moisturizing via &#x27;water&#x27; rather than some oily chemical. This product is great! It glides on easier than any product I&#x27;ve ever used and my skin feels very soft and smooth. The problem is that it kind of burns shortly after being applied and makes my cheeks turn bright red and blotchy, which takes about 30 minutes to fade. I initially thought this might be caused by the strong retinoid I use, so one night I applied the water gel right after cleansing with a gentle cleanser, holding off on the retinoid. But my cheeks turned red regardless. I also tried other cleansers, but right after I apply this my face gets red still. It has to be the water gel. This surprised me because it comes across as a gentle product. Upon reading the ingredients closer I found hydrogen peroxide. Peroxides can be extremely damaging to the skin if used regularly. Thats the whole reason I stopped using benzoyl peroxide for my acne. But despite the redness, I continue to use it. I hope I am not damaging my skin or irritating it further!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product once a day for about a month now. It does a great job with keeping my skin hydrated and soft.  On days where I don&#x27;t feel like wearing makeup, I will just splash water on my face and neck, pat lightly with a towel, then apply this gel, then a moisture cream for a clean, natural look.  Drawback is it&#x27;s a tad expensive for a drugstore brand, but I will definitely buy some once I use mine up. It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling, can&#x27;t detect any odor, and seems to be absorbed quickly, even on top of makeup. My skin has definitely improved from using this product. I was lucky enough to be able to try Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> it feels and smells great!</li>
    <li> Though I like the hydrating aspect this gel has a fragrance that the &amp;#34;ultra hydrating&amp;#34; gel-cream does not.  As I&#x27;m sensitive to such this will be going back or given to a friend who isnt</li>
    <li> Lots of moisture added to skin.  I use it often.</li>
    <li> I received the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel to test and review. At first I thought it was a face cleanser, but it is actually a moisturizer. I’ve been using Clinique’s Dark Spot Corrector and a SPF Moisturizer for my daily routine but decided to try this after an evening shower since I didn’t need to worry about needing SPF. It has a nice clean scent, although personally I don’t like putting scented stuff on my face as I always worry it’ll negatively affect me. Luckily it didn’t. This was definitely very moisturizing and felt much more lightweight than I was expecting based on what it looked/felt like. Even though this is a facial moisturizer, my legs have been peeling from a sunburn so I decided to use it on them too and I really liked how it worked. Granted, this product is a little pricey to be using all over my body. If this product had SPF in it, I could see it replacing my current daily moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: This complementary item was received for review purposes. All opinions are my own and no compensation was received.</li>
    <li> Great product! In addition to having an oily t-zone, I have normal to dry skin everywhere else. However with Hydro Boost, my skin seems to even out all-over and is very soft. I love it!</li>
    <li> When I received the product I was surprised by the small size.  But big things do come in small packages.  This 1.7 oz gel will last me for a while, You don&#x27;t need to use a lot.  It&#x27;s smooth.  It&#x27;s like giving your skin a drink of water.  I love the product and the results.  Buy it!</li>
    <li> Great night-time moisturizer for when your skin is super dry.  Feels great, smells great, works instantly.  A bit on the expensive side, but it works really well.</li>
    <li> Cool when applied, quick dry.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin, so I am always careful with moisturizers. This is a very lightweight gel. After applying it to my face and neck, I noticed no residue or oiliness. It is absorbed by the skin really quickly. I thought this was going to be my nighttime moisturizer, but it can be used for the day without worrying about making the face too oily. The only issue with it being the day moisturizer is that it does not offer UV protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to its effectiveness, it seems ok. I would not use this at night. I personally use a heavier moisturizer at night. But this is perfect to use before the makeup.</li>
    <li> There were a number of things I liked about this product.  It is a very lightweight, gel-type moisturizer.  It was very easy to apply to my face and spread very easily.  I felt it did an adequate job of moisturizing and softening my skin.  I don&#x27;t have particularly dry skin and my forehead tends to be oily.  What I really liked about this moisturizer is that it actually seemed to help the oiliness of my forehead.  At the very least, it didn&#x27;t make it worse and this was a first for me.  Anything I apply to my forehead seems to make it more oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus is the size of the container; it is large and hold a lot of the moisturizer.  One jar of this stuff should last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t detect any funny or offensive odor which can bother some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all a good, basic moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Very Light and hydrating to the skin. Love that its not sticky. A nice pleasant scent. I would recommend this product to others</li>
    <li> I have had nothing but great experiences with Neutrogena products, and this one is no exception. I have been using this product, day and night, for over a week and it has been doing a great job with my dry winter skin. I personally despise the oily goopy texture of oil based products, and so I love this water &#x27;gel&#x27; and the slight tingle that I get when I put it on my skin. There is a light fragrance, but definitely not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would tell people to watch out for, is that it has a very runny consistency, so a little goes a long way. Also the jar is very slippery and heavy for its size so if it falls out of your hand, it&#x27;s easier for the contents to get spilled :/</li>
    <li> I like the way Neutrogena&#x27;s white, lardy-like cream smells and feels on the skin, and I use that all the time, and this is very very different. It is gooey and blue, like Icy Hot, but not quite as thick. Be careful the first time you open the jar as it splashes right out on you. It doesn&#x27;t have any particular smell and doesn&#x27;t feel cooling or warming, but at least it seems to soak in really fast so you don&#x27;t have a gooey face. Does it hydrate? Can&#x27;t tell until I finish the jar and have not grown a day older in that time.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product.  So many moisturizers out there are scented, but as someone with sensitive skin, I appreciated this Neutrogena gel having no smell.  It feels great on the skin and moisturizes it well. The gel itself doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and you don&#x27;t need to put on a lot at a time for it to work. Overall, I would definitely recommend this Neutrogena product.</li>
    <li> As far as how the product feels and works: I like it, just a little does a great job of moisturizing without clogging your pores or feeling heavy on your skin. I also think it smells really nice, to me it smells similar to roses, but I have been told that I have a weird sense of smell so I wouldn&#x27;t guarantee that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that did bother was the word&amp;#34;acid&amp;#34; in the front label. I thought, &amp;#34;Gee is it really a good idea to spread acid on your face every morning??&amp;#34;&amp;#34; So I looked it up on webmd here is part of what they say about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Hyaluronic acid is a substance that is naturally present in the human body. It is found in the highest concentrations in fluids in the eyes and joints. The hyaluronic acid that is used as medicine is extracted from rooster combs or made by bacteria in the laboratory...&lt;br /&gt;There is also a lot of interest in using hyaluronic acid to prevent the effects of aging. In fact, hyaluronic acid has been promoted as a &amp;#34;fountain of youth.&amp;#34; However, there is no evidence to support the claim that taking it by mouth or applying it to the skin can prevent changes associated with aging.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether that is something you are comfortable with or not is up to you but I thought everyone should know. This product does work, but I have been using aloe vera gel with vegetable glycerin for months and it works just as well, is cheaper, and isn&#x27;t made from rooster combs or bacteria in a lab. I think this is a nice product and works well but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it when there is cheaper, more natural and just as effective to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Hydro Boost Water Gel all over my face (not the eyes, of course) for about a week now, 2x a day, in the bitter cold of Minnesota in the winter. I can tell you that it moisturizes without leaving a film or greasy feel. It rubs in smoothly (since it&#x27;s a water gel, I imagine) and has a GREAT smell, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the driest, coldest weather I experience, this has been a perfectly hydrating product. My face feels clean and smooth and it makes me very happy to have this on hand for the rest of the winter!</li>
    <li> I have always been a huge Neutrogena fan! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever tried one of their products and not loved it. Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel is another awesome product that I&#x27;m not going to be able to live without.  This moisturizer is just perfection. First of all, it feels fantastic going on. It&#x27;s cool and refreshing and light. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, or leave a sheen. And best of all, it leaves my skin soft and supple. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin looks healthier, brighter and even my pores seems to shrink. I absolutely adore this product!</li>
    <li> I love this cream and plan on getting more this coming summer. It&#x27;s a little light for the winter (for me) but I love the clean, refreshing feel of it and like I said, I&#x27;m buying more this summer. I have fair, combo skin that is now aging so it&#x27;s always a problem finding a nice cream that is not greasy. This cream is wonderful--it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all and absorbs right in. I feared it might not go on very well because of it being a &#x27;water gel&amp;#34; but it is very, very smooth and goes on great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is not perfumey, either, which I really appreciate. It has a very light and pleasant odor that I personally find refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not quite &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; enough for me for winter wear when the dry areas on my face really get dry, but for other seasons, this is the perfect cream for me. I really like it under makeup, too, because it doesn&#x27;t make my makeup &amp;#34;slip off&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;clump up&amp;#34; or go on in weird patterns which some other crams can do to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that this would not have much of a smell, but it actually makes me sneeze throughout the day.  So, if you have allergies, stay away.</li>
    <li> Wow straight from the gods! Idk how I&#x27;ve lived my life without this product!</li>
    <li> use with a good Vit C serum or by itself.  stuff is amazing, and lasts a long time.  I use day and night.</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle of Hydro Boost Water Gel I have purchased from Amazon. I really like how it absorbs quickly into my skin. I use a prescription retinol each night in addition to this. I will apply the retinol and wait about 20 minutes and apply a thin layer of the Hydro Boost..it tingles slightly but it actually feels pretty good:) I have somewhat oily skin also and it doesn&#x27;t make me any more oily during the day when I apply before putting on makeup. Has a great smell too..very clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite moisturizer! I have dry  very acne prone skin. This suffering feels and smells amazing! When my skin gets dry and flaky this stuff helps it go back to normal over night! Since using this my skin has less breakouts and is incredibly soft! Softer than my skin has been in a long long time!</li>
    <li> I found mine like opened before since there was something black in the gel. But tbh, it&#x27;s worthy and a good gel for moisture.</li>
    <li> Ehh.  It smells nice, and feels nice.  But I need a little more cream and thicker product.  Its not my go to, but I keep it on my countertop.</li>
    <li> One word AMAZING! I have a really hard time with most creams because they are usually too greasy and I hate grease on my face especially if I am putting on makeup in the morning and at night I feel like if the cream is greasy it will come off on my pillow and cause a big mess. Most creams don&#x27;t completely absorb, but this one is completely different. Its so cool and refreshing when it comes on and the smell is just amazing. Absorbs within seconds and lasts all day.  Best cream I have ever tried, and I have tried many, expensive ones and none come close to this one.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s enough for my extreme dry skin. I need something that is oil based. But that is my preference.    Overall, I&#x27;m disappointed in the jar packaging, which leads to the breakdown of ingredients. It&#x27;s also very unhygienic. And the addition of fragrance in this product is so unnecessary. Fragrance is no skincare. A great concept, but poorly executed.    *This product was provider to me for free for testing purposes and all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Simply amazing stuff. I am very picky about any type of moisturizer I put on my face as I break out easy but this product is the best I have tried. I even loved it so much I tried it on my knuckles as they were so dry they hurt and were about to peel... 2 days they are almost PERFECT. In shock. Love LOVE love</li>
    <li> This lotion is very light and airy once on.  It soaks up easily and leaves behind a soft feel.  It&#x27;s almost like putting baby powder on your skin so that it&#x27;s soft but not greasy.  I&#x27;m definitely sold on this product and would highly recommend it to anyone who is in the market for a moisturizer that is worth your time, effort, and money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the opportunity to test Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free from Influenster, but all of the opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I got this to try free from influenster and im so glad I did. These winter months have been harsh on my skin and just after several uses my skin is feeling better. Its such a refreshed hydrated feeling honestly I dont thing my skin has ever felt this great. I was looking to get into a good skincare regimen and this is absolutely perfect im glad I got this!</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a new moisturizer as this winter has been brutal on my skin. After some research I knew I wanted to try gel because I have oil and acne prone skin with some dry cheek patches and any time I put something creamy on it feels so heavy and greasy. I tend to slather on moisturizer heavily because if I don&#x27;t I feel like it never works, so when I saw how expensive the gel moisturizers were at some high end places I just chose not to buy them. I did some searching online and found  Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel and was like JACKPOT!  Now here is the funny part, after I bought this for myself I was actually asked to test it (for free) by Neutrogena! Now I have two jars and will be soft skinned basically forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a wash and exfoliation I rubbed in a good dollop of gel. I was worried I grabbed too much but it wasn&#x27;t greasy and absorbed in my skin really really well. My skin feels clean and soft like the day after a facial. I can&#x27;t stop touching my cheeks. Now it wasn&#x27;t miraculous but it&#x27;s a super solid daily moisturizer for the girl who doesn&#x27;t want an oil slick of moisturizer under her foundation or on her pillow. Perfect for the all dreaded combination skin.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product. It&#x27;s lightweight and doesn&#x27;t feel like there is any residue left on my skin. I&#x27;ve been using it at night and in the morning before putting on my makeup. It makes my skin soft and take away dryness before making my make up application easier&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this product for free, but the opinions are solely my own.</li>
    <li> I just received this product from Neutrogena via Influenster free of charge to test and I have to admit, it&#x27;s actually pretty amazing. It feels cool once I put it on my face and doesn&#x27;t feel oily. Definitely loving so far!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a couple of days, but I&#x27;m headed into the 5 star area. However, since I&#x27;ve only used this twice I can&#x27;t give a full review. My first impression of this was &amp;#34;WOW!&amp;#34; My skin felt soft (and it&#x27;s like a desert wasteland) so immediate first impression is awesome! The smell is light and clean. I like that I don&#x27;t have that greasy residue or weird film on my skin after use. This literally sinks into the skin leaving it soft and supple. OH, and a little goes a long way! I&#x27;m expecting this to last a good 6/8 months with daily use.</li>
    <li> I received the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel From the Influenster Vox Box for free for review. I like this product alot. It is refreshing and moisturizing without being too heavy, cakey or leaving behind a filmy residue. However I have two complaints that keep it from being a 5 star. There is no SPF so I dont think it provides enough coverage to be an amazing day time moisturizer and there is no salic acid for night time moisturizing to prevent acne. Other than that great moisturizer that needs a bit of accompaniment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something to help my dry skin on my face and I&#x27;ve found it! This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used. I put it on before bed and my skin stays soft throughout the next day. Even the smell of this is good! I will be buying again!</li>
    <li> Sodium Hydroxide is a toxic material and according to OHSA can cause serious skin conditions burning and lung problems.  I am returning it for a full refund and I just received it today.  Always conduct a research investigation of the product ingredients prior to purchase.</li>
    <li> Full disclosure: I received this product free for testing purposes through Influenster.com. As always, all opinions and views expressed are entirely my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel smooths easily all over your face and neck, and feels so cool and refreshing. It also dries quickly with little scent (and the scent it does have is great.) Despite its quick absorption, I can definitely feel the difference on my skin for hours. It feels so smooth and soft, not to mention the long-term effects: no more dryness or itchiness, plus a radiant glow. And I&#x27;ve only been using it about a week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are a couple of my favorite things about this product:&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s oil-free, lightweight, and leaves no negative effect on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;-The gel can be worn under makeup, so I use it after washing my face at night and in the morning before getting ready.&lt;br /&gt;-A little goes a long way, so I know that this jar will last me a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is awesome and can be applied and dried in less than 30 seconds- which fits right into my busy schedule! I really can&#x27;t wait to see more long-term results and I would 100% recommend this product to anyone who needs a healthy moisturizer. Not to mention, this is the perfect time to repair your skin from the harsh winter weather and prep it for the summer sun that will be here before you know it!</li>
    <li> very, very moisturizing; absorption rate is fantastic</li>
    <li> Adds moisture to skin without that greasy feeling</li>
    <li> This product has a very nice feel and a light, refreshing scent. It is a very light moisturizer, which I personally prefer. A little bit goes a LONG way, which is nice. The reason for my poor review really comes down to the ingredients. I personally don&#x27;t feel that fragrance and &#x27;blue 1&#x27; are necessary in skin care. I&#x27;ll freely admit to being fairly crunchy on the skincare front, so this is probably something I&#x27;ll pass along to a friend with less sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The first time using the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel was a surprise! It was different. It was unlike a product I have ever tried. It is a gel but the consistency is much lighter. It may feel very liquid like but it absorbs quickly and efficiently. I have only used the product in the evening but it is perfect to wear under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel after cleansing and then follow with another moisturizer for added hydration. While I do not need the second layer of moisturizer, I like to keep my face feel soft.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!!! I have really oily skin but In the winter time it gets dry in certain spots!!!  I needed something that would moisturize my skin but wouldn&#x27;t make it oily like every other moisturizer I have used!!!! This stuff is great! My skin feels baby soft after I use it as well! I cannot wait to go out and buy the eye cream to this line!!! I did get Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are my own!</li>
    <li> The cold winter we&#x27;ve been having in New York has made my skin incredibly dry, red and windblown. I started using this product a few weeks ago and I have seen a great deal of improvement. I have been using it twice daily, before applying makeup in the morning and after washing my face at night. I love the way it makes my skin feel super smooth and makes foundation application very easy and gives my face a great smooth looking finish. Even though I received the product free for review, it is definitely something that I will repurchase in the future.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel is now my absolute favorite face product that I have in my skincare routine. It makes my skin feel extremely refreshed and hydrated. It has a light cooling effect that makes your face feel very clean. I use this at night and the hydration lasts throughout the next day. It does not make my face oily or break it out. It feels like sunshine &amp; ocean on your face. I would highly recommend this product to EVERYONE! I even have my boyfriend using it now because it is such a great product. I no longer suffer from dry, winter skin. I was fortunate enough to receive this product for free through Influenster for my review. This review is 100% how I feel about the product and the opinions of the product are my own.</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel...soft and hydrated.  I also love the smell.  It&#x27;s light and reminds me of my Nana who always put lotions on her face and she had beautiful skin, even at 90 years old.</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be much heavier/dense. I was delighted when it should up and really felt like water on my skin! Hydro boost is definitely an appropriate name!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I think it made me break out on the first couple days of using it, but I&#x27;m hoping that goes away with time.</li>
    <li> I was wary of trying this product as Neutrogena products in the past have irritated my skin and eyes.  Well they must have changed their formula because this is amazing.  I love this product.  It is so hydrating but so light.  This winter, as we all know, has been brutal in the East Coast so this has really kept my skin from getting dried out.  I have been using this product for 2 weeks and this may replace my current Olay moisturizer.  It does not feel heavy at all on my skin and blends seamlessly with my makeup.  I love the packaging and the blue tint to the product.  It has a light fresh scent which I surprisingly like as I really don&#x27;t like fragrances in my facial skin care products.  Overall this product is fabulous.  The only reason I gave it 4 starts instead of 5 was because, as I previously stated, I am not a fan of fragrances in facial skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free for testing purposes but my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I normally feel like I need an actual cream to do the job, but I have to say this stuff is amazing. I started using it after I had my baby and my skin was looking dull and gray. A week and a half later I look like my self again and my skin isn&#x27;t dry at all. I&#x27;ve even been using this instead of my night cream.</li>
    <li> Received this to try out and I must say it&#x27;s amazing.  Never had a moisturizer quite like this it leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I got this free from Influenster for testing purposes. All opinions are mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the packaging of this product it really does fit in with the name &amp;#34;water gel&amp;#34;. The actual moisturizer is very very light which I liked very much and I really felt that my face was moisturized after it as applied. It is very light another plus as I hate having heavy creams on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe with this which has me toggling between I like and it&#x27;s ok is that I don&#x27;t find it lasts all day and it is not spf. I would like to continue to use this for some more time before I actually decide it it&#x27;s a LOVE</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS GEL!!! Let me start of by saying that I do not have bad skin. I average about 7 breakouts a year. I have used Proactiv+, the &amp;#34;proclaimed gift from God&amp;#34; for skin, and this is better than any Proactiv+ product, in my opinion. Proactiv+ has a 3 step program that always left my skin a bit oily when I woke up from a nights sleep, took days to rid my face of mild acne, and it is TOO EXPENSIVE!! The Hydro Boost gel left my skin soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom and oil-free. 10 hrs after putting it on, which was before bed, I woke up looking radiant! I already use a face brightening scrub, but this enhanced the brightness in my skin tenfold. It gave me a more even skin-tone, which I LOVE because I am weening myself off of makeup. The clearer my skin is, the quicker I can stop clogging my pores with makeup! I have never used Neutrogena face products before, but I will continue to use this as long as they sell it. It doesn&#x27;t have a harsh smell, it applies smoothly, and it lasts! It does not have the consistency of an actual gel (like the thick, jell-o ones you use for your hair), it is more of a light, airy cream that has a blue tint to it. I love to overdo everything. I always feel that the more product I use, the better off I&#x27;ll be, but trust me when I say that you do not need that much product. Which is another pro. When I first saw that this little container was $15, I was hesitant because I am used to buying products over the counter that costs less than $10, but you really get your money&#x27;s worth. I see this lasting me two months, and I wash my face twice a day. An extremely little dab covers my whole face. I am so glad I came across this product. In case you wanted to know, my daily regimen is as follows: scrub in cleanser (with my clean, washed hands...never clean your face with dirty hands) for 2min. to exfoliate, apply astringent to further clean my face of any dirt the scrub didn&#x27;t get, and then I moisturize with the gel. My skin has never looked better and I am truly thankful for this affordable product. Excellently priced and does a great job. As I said before, I don&#x27;t have bad skin...so if you&#x27;re looking for a miracle to help with cystic acne or anything of the sort..I wouldn&#x27;t look to this product for salvation. However, it definitely helps with the occasional break out. I am also adding a clay mask to my face regimen, which is supposed to exfoliate and unclog pores so hopefully that even furthers my skin success. I wish you all good luck in determining which product is right for you. I know narrowing it down can be hard, but I hope this review provides some perspective!</li>
    <li> My skin loves this moisturizer! It absorbs quickly and locks in moisture all day long. My skin usually absorbs my moisturizer and makeup very quickly. Now I have a new morning routine. I rinse my face with lukewarm water, then apply the hydro boost water gel and then all my makeup. I now have this awesome glow and my skin looks replenished without feeling oily. My other issue is dry skin in the morning. I apply the hydro boost water gel at night and wake up with a great glow and my skin feels smooth and not oily at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t dislike the fragance but I could do without it. It smells clean but I can smell it for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel for free.</li>
    <li> I got this to test via Influester and their VoxBox. The packaging is pretty! On first sniff, the scent is light but nice. A deeper sniff brings me some floral with the typical &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; smell. The texture is light and is easily spread over my skin. It absorbed quickly and my skin does feel a bit smoother. As someone with dry skin, this is fantastic for adding a bit of moisture to my skin. However, because it is so light, it&#x27;s not a great long term moisturizer but more of a I need a touchup during the day. My skin feels cooler after using it too!</li>
    <li> I really like that it&#x27;s oil-free and feels very light weight on my skin. It goes on smoothly and isn&#x27;t heavy. But it doesn&#x27;t really seem to moisturize my skin that well. I noticed that my skin was still very dry. #BehindTheGlow</li>
    <li> This Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel is a thin, clearish/white/blue gel that absorbs very quickly into your skin. The scent is smells soapy but it is very light. The hyaluronic acid in this gel helps you cells absorb up to 1000 times their weight in water.  It also has olive extra to protect your skin from moisture loss and glycerin to replenish lost moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it helps moisturize your skin this is NOT a moisturizer.  Unless you have very oily skin, you will need a moisturizer with this.  It should be part of your regular skincare routine.  Personal I apply it right after cleansing.  Once it dries (about 20 seconds) I put on my eye cream and then my moisturizer.  I received 2 of these jars to try for free to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a very good gel if you use it everyday you will notice a difference.  I am going to purchase the Hydro Boost Gel-Cream (not to be confused with this Water Gel) as my skin is extremely dry and I feel that will be a much better alternative to me especially in winter.  I will use the Water Gel in spring &amp; summer when my skin isn&#x27;t as dry.</li>
    <li> I was able to test this product for free. The first night I used it after washing my face before bed. I really liked the way it felt on my skin. I continued to use it everyday instead of my oil based moisturizer. By day 3 I could see that thyou product was not strong enough for my skin. I would apply it and a few minutes later I could see that my face was still dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I did like the product at first, it wasn&#x27;t enough for me. I might try it in the summertime when my skin is not as dry as it is in the winter. I think it would work great on someone with normal or oily skin. But not people with dry skin.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer reminds me of one of my former favorites: Clinique Moisture Surge. It&#x27;s a similar light, water-based formula with a similar texture and feel (but it&#x27;s blue rather than pink -- to differentiate more than anything?). It absorbs incredibly quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, sticky, or greasy on my face. When I wanted a light moisturizer that wouldn&#x27;t bring on a breakout (which is to say, when I was in college), this is just the kind of product I chose. Now that I am a little older and have wrinkles to worry about, I prefer something a little more intense and nourishing. Still, for young skin, for summer, and for alternating with a richer cream, this gel formula does the trick. Please note: I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free from Influenster, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by this gel. It doesn&#x27;t have an intense smell and feels clean and smooth when I put it on, but it hasn&#x27;t really quenched my dry skin like I was hoping. I live in Minnesota so the constant winter and cold air destroys my cheeks. I get itchy dry spots. I&#x27;m on day 3 (I know that&#x27;s not that many) and I feel myself wanting to reapply by the afternoon - even if I haven&#x27;t been outside. I gave it four stars because I like how it feels. I don&#x27;t feel like I have a heavy protectant cream on my face nor does it feel like a sticky gel, just fresh and clean. I will continue to use it but not sure I&#x27;d buy a bottle myself. I received mine from Influenster for free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I was given this product to review from Influenster - opinions are my own. I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple days, both morning and night. I have moderately dry skin. It is great to apply right before applying foundation; really nice base. However, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s hydrating enough to use at night. My skin is still pretty dry when I wake up. Bottom line: this is a great pre-makeup moisturizer. Find something else for your night cream</li>
    <li> This product has a nice, clean, spa-like scent, and features a cooling, refreshing sensation when applied to the skin. I find that it doesn&#x27;t absorb right away, but once it does my skin doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or oily in the slightest. I used this as both a night cream and a day cream. Unfortunately, just a couple of hours after applying this moisturizer my skin starts to feel tight and itchy in a few spots; dry patches popped up in a couple of places as well. This may be a fine moisturizer for those with normal skin, but for someone who suffers from very dry skin during the winter months, this product is simply not hydrating enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel compliments of Influenster for testing purposes; all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a little over a week and I love it so far. I usually apply it in the mornings right after I shower when my skin feels dry the most and works amazing. I immediately feel the difference and hydrates my face immediately without making oily.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin, so i got it to use in the summer. I live in Arizona and when its 100+ using cream on my face is not going to happen, so will have to let you know as we get into summer.</li>
    <li> Hmmmm... I&#x27;m torn on this. It&#x27;s expensive, but not as expensive as the Clinique Moisturizing Gel that I use both day and night currently. I&#x27;m looking for another alternative to the Clinique moisturizer for night time because I need more hydration at night. The reviews were great on this product, so I decided to try it out and I&#x27;m a bit disappointed after the initial use. It felt great going on and it definitely hydrates my skin, but it has a scent and, about an hour after applying it, my face felt slightly itchy. I&#x27;m wondering if I&#x27;m going to have irritation from this stuff now... This is odd because I never react to Neutrogena products. It&#x27;s a shame because I think this would have worked great for night time use (it&#x27;s too thick to go under makeup and leaves my skin slightly sticky - I barely used any too, just a small amount of product that had accumulated on the lid). I&#x27;m going to use it a few more times just to make sure that my skin isn&#x27;t randomly itchy or because of another product. If it continues to cause itching, I might return the product next week.  Update: I&#x27;ve used this product once as a night moisturizer and, yes, it moisturizes, but it doesn&#x27;t keep my skin moisturized all night. The itching seems to have subsided and it is no longer a problem. There is a very, very slight greasy feel to the product, which I&#x27;m not a big fan of, but it&#x27;s not awful. I bought an actual night cream that I&#x27;m going to apply at night that I really like, so I&#x27;ll use this during the day when I&#x27;m not wearing make-up, like on the weekends. It does the job, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s an intense moisturizer. I also wouldn&#x27;t put this under my makeup because of the hint of an oily residue that it leaves... My skin is combination, but more on the dry side. It&#x27;s just an okay product. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love how this product feels on my skin - it really moisturizes it well and it has a very mild scent that I love. I have always been challenged with moisture retention. Needless to say, I was very happy to get a chance to try this product. It truly helped with the dry patches on some parts of my face - specially on some parts of my nose and around my eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. Iâ€™m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end userâ€™s standpoint.</li>
    <li> Love.. Love .. Love.. this product. If you have normal to oily skin and looking something that makes your face fresh without that flimsy feeling of other moisturizers, then this is the one. My face breaks out very easily but after switching to Hydro Boost, I have zero break out. I love this product. Super gel, goes inside the skin so fast and makes it dewy fresh. Of course, gels are not for dry skin and using it on dry skin in winter will require other products as well.</li>
    <li> I received it as a tester item from Influenster. Since it is winter time, my skin gets a little dry. I&#x27;ve been using the hydro boost water gel and it has been wonderful. My skin feels really good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light and keeps your face smoothe. My hubby noticed the glow it left after a few days. It took me a whole week before I saw it in my own face. :) the smell is amazing! I puteam on my face every morning before applying makeup and after washing my face before bed. And I didn&#x27;t feel like it would make my face super greasy. I also LOVED using it after a cleansing mask once a week :)</li>
    <li> After receiving this product for sampling by Influenster I was excited to try it! I have been using it for almost a month and i can honestly say i love this stuff! I takes just a tiny bit and it smells great! I feel refreshed and hydrated! I love that this is not oil based but rather water based! Thank you influenster. It does not help my with redness</li>
    <li> I have always used neutrogena. I look for products with hydro acid. Very good for your skin. Just started using. Makes my skin feel good. I will give it a couple months.</li>
    <li> Recently, I was given the Neutrogena Hydroboost Water Gel to try out and review.  I actually really like the product for a couple reasons, and not just because it was free:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this really does feel like water.  It glides on smoothly and gives my face a cool burst.  It is really light-weight and doesn’t sit on top of my face like a lot of night creams.  My face feels like I just splashed water on it and does a really great job of absorbing into my skin and leaving it feeling hydrated.  This contains Hyaluronic Acid, which helps increase smoothness and decrease wrinkles.  Woohoo!  And it’s oil-free, so your skin isn’t left with that sticky feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit does go a long way, so I think I could use this product for months before having to buy it again.  After a week of using this Hydroboost Gel, my skin does appear smoother and has a glow to it.  Having dry skin makes it hard for me to find a product that helps with flaking and Neutrogena really did a great job with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’re out of your current cream or looking to try something new for your nighttime routine, I definitely recommend trying this out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this product out for free, but all opinions are my own :)</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Very hydrating, but not greasy. Smells great too! Wish it had a sunscreen. But other than that, I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic for oily skin.. Feels great on skin and plumps it up.. Wonderful smell too..</li>
    <li> I have always loved neutrogena products especially for winter because my face completely dries out and is gross. This gel definitely helped rehydrate my skin so that it wasn&#x27;t so scaly! I use it mostly before bed and in the morning. I was lucky enough to test it for free and I&#x27;m glad because I would definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product 1-2 times daily for about 3.5 weeks and I think it works well to provide light hydration to my skin. This is going to be a great moisturizer for the Summer months. This product did not clog my pores or cause a breakout. I love that it has Hyaluronic Acid in it. I think this product could be improved by packaging it in a squeeze tube. I don&#x27;t like having to stick my fingers back in the jar each time. I think it wastes product and a little bit of this gel moisturizer goes a very long way. I also used this on my neck and chest. I loved how soft it made the back of my neck and chest. The smell is also very nice and fresh.  I would recommend this for anyone looking for lightweight hydration. I was sent this product to test for free but these opinons are completely my own and I am always 100% honest in my reviews.</li>
    <li> I like the way my face feels and smeels when I use the Hydro Boost. My skin is very soft but It doesnt last all day.</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I got a chance to try out Neutrogena&#x27;s HydroBoost water gel! (Complimentary from Influenster for review purposes) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have tried it on my own. &lt;br /&gt;I noticed a difference after the first use! My skin felt super soft and hydrated (which has been nice, since I&#x27;m in the process of repairing my hair and skin from Winter Damage). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorite parts of the water gel, is the natural/healthy glow (or &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; look) that I&#x27;m noticing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a very easy change in my Skincare routine too. After I wash my face, I apply my Vitamin C Serum, Toner, then Neutrogena&#x27;s Hydro Boost Water Gel!&lt;br /&gt;(Side note: I have beyond sensitive skin, and I have no issues while using this product)</li>
    <li> This is WONDERFUL.  The first time I used it, I had bathed and then sat on the bed, took 3 fingertips into it and spotted it over my face.  It soaks in easily, glides as you smooth it across your face, get into the creases and down the sides of your face.  It dried quickly, did not leave my face feeling tight, and there was no sticky gooey mess.  My face felt so smooth and soft.  Since I&#x27;ve started using it, my make up glides on without leaving any in the pores.  It doesn&#x27;t use a lot and I now am including my neck and upper chest area and it&#x27;s all feels so soft.  This is one product I will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> This product is incredible! From the second I opened the package I was in love with the scent. It smells so fresh and clean. I applied a thin layer after washing my face and it sunk into my skin so nicely. I was a little weary being it is water based but I really like it. It is refreshing and makes your skin feel silky!    *This product was provided to me for free through Influenster for review and all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I have combination oily/dry skin. Mainly oily with a few dry spots. After washing my face before bed I use the Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel. My skin felt replenished and refreshed. It didn&#x27;t feel greasy or too heavy. I will definitely use this product again. It will be perfect for the summer when it gets hot and humid. Perfect moisturizer not too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all of my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I have loved Neutrogena products all my life. My mother raised my sister and I on these products. Whenever a new one comes out I&#x27;m excited to try it. This Hydro Boost came out at the perfect time. My skin is so dry and tight this time of year. I received a full size product for free thanks to Influenster. I washed my face as normal and then applied this gel. My skin felt amazing just after 1 application!  My skin felt nice and hydrated, no greasy. Neutrogena did it again with a fabulous and affordable product!!</li>
    <li> I love this product! Neutrogena has a total win here. I wanted to use it for a couple days before I posted my review to make sure it worked as good as it did on day 1. I have completely given up my face moisturizer and now just use this product! My face felt smooth and hydrated all day! I hope Neutrogena makes one for the whole body because I would totally give up lotion for this.</li>
    <li> I recently began using this product every morning after I shower. I live in Colorado where it is very dry in the winter time (I used to like in Georgia where there is some humidity in the winter time that doesn&#x27;t completely dry me out). I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a moisturizer that keeps my face hydrated all day long. FINALLY I found my product! I have noticed such a huge difference in my how my skin feels after just a week of using this moisturizer. It is softer and always feels hydrated! Just wish they made water gel lotions for your WHOLE body! I also love that it doesn&#x27;t take much of this product to cover my whole face. This a great product that I was lucky enough to test out as a free sample. All opinions are my own and will most certainly be buying more when my sample runs out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only reason this product did not receive full stars is because I still find it to be a little on the expensive side for a drugstore moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This product has become the perfect alternative for me to replace using face lotions that, even ones for sensitive skin, were still clogging my pores and felt heavy.  However, this gel is so light, it dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel.  After a few days of using both morning and night, I have noticed how much softer and more hydrated my skin feels.  As an added bonus, the gel smells really good so it is refreshing to put on my face in the morning and before bed.  The clear jar is pretty, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel for free, but these are opinions are my own from testing this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product! I&#x27;ve tried a million different moisturizers for my combination skin, but nothing has helped without breaking me out, until now. Because this product is water based it&#x27;s very light &amp; &amp;#34;airy&amp;#34; as opposed to thick &amp; greasy like most moisturizers. After the first application, I immediately started seeing results. My skin was instantly softer &amp; I was even able to put liquid foundation over it without a breakout. Thank you, Neutrogena! ðŸ˜ƒ  *I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost free for Influenster*</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion from Neutrogena. It goes on light and gives you a fresh feeling.</li>
    <li> Love how it adds moisture to my skin, it feels very hydrated.</li>
    <li> I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free through Influenster but all opinions are my own. I live above 6500 feet, which means it&#x27;s very dry here and my skin shows it. I used the Neutrogena Hydro Boost in the evenings or early mornings and then covered with a sunscreen. I can honestly say my skin feels a lot more hydrated and moisturized throughout the night. I also really like the scent of the product as it&#x27;s light and refreshing. I don&#x27;t really feel the need to gob this product on. I use a small pea sized amount and lightly spread it across my skin. It doesn&#x27;t take much. If I use to much it feels a bit heavy and doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well. A little goes a long way. The only downside to this product is that it&#x27;s a bit higher priced than I&#x27;d imagine for an every day drug store type product, and that&#x27;s my reason for rating it 4 instead of 5 stars.</li>
