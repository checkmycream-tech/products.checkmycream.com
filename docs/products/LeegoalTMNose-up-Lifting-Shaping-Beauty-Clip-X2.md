### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Your product is great, though!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
      <li>&lt;3</li>
      <li>and I am thrilled!!</li>
      <li>It matched my features beautifully.</li>
      <li>GREAT result yet</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t stay on, makes a great clip for potato chip bags though.</li>
      <li>I  can already see an amazing difference!</li>
      <li>This clip takes discipline to see results, so wear it every morning and evening for a good fifteen minutes.</li>
      <li>Arrived on time, I thought the price is good, still testing them out.</li>
      <li>Its a good deal considering that you get 2 clips, just incase one breaks.  </li>
      <li>The product arrived on time and in good condition but there is no instruction on how to use it.</li>
      <li>Good thing</li>
      <li>I also felt like it would be good if i use it when i was swimming</li>
      <li>im definitely satisfied with this product!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Rulav its much better!</li>
      <li>These things are amazing when you want to drain your nose and helps over time with the size of your nose.</li>
      <li>I would be seen as gorgeous or stunning.</li>
      <li>Product arrived quickly and was packed nicely and great customer support.</li>
      <li>For quite some time I started to notice I wasnt found as pretty, or merely attractive.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>Hmmm..not sure if it&#x27;s working.</li>
      <li>but I got used to it and was able to wear it and forget I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
      <li>It will be interesting to see.</li>
      <li>I love them and it works</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t stand not being able to breath through my nose.</li>
      <li>Thats what ruined my face the most.</li>
      <li>Will shop again and buy more products from this seller.</li>
      <li>I can now breathe so much better than before.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My nose was more defined, and it was slimmer.</li>
      <li>but surely it is working</li>
      <li>These work ok.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t expecting it to work, glad it was so cheap</li>
      <li>Comfortable but make sure oil is removed on nose or it will slip off.</li>
      <li>so I love these cheap 2 packs</li>
      <li>i really recommend this product for every one who has a big nose to become more beautiful and look good guy .</li>
      <li>I honestly dont think that it lifts your nose up, but it does temporary right after you take them off.  </li>
      <li>Rinsing was effective up to a point, as there was a blockage in my nose on the right side.</li>
      <li>breath through your nose when wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap and easy to use.</li>
      <li>and i saw a huge difference.</li>
      <li>It also helps to make sure your nose is oil free (I use hot water and Neutrogena soap) and to warm the silicone parts with hot water before you put the clip on.</li>
      <li>i guess its worth the try though, since its so cheap!</li>
      <li>cheap... doesn&#x27;t work</li>
      <li>it makes any miracles i only use em once in a great while</li>
      <li>I am excited and look forward to feeling pretty again.&lt;br /&gt;Please be sure to use this as it was intended to - for 15 minutes or so a day.</li>
      <li>Sometimes you just have to think &#x27;Out of the Box&#x27; and work with an original idea.</li>
      <li>You have to clean your nose with a toner or alcohol so clip doesn&#x27;t slip off.</li>
      <li>Nothing permanent but a quick temporary fix.</li>
      <li>I love it, and I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I am excited because I will look forward to sculpting my nose to the exact way I&#x27;d like it to look -</li>
      <li>it made my nose smaller and prettier :) i want to thank the person who made this product!</li>
      <li>so i really dont know if they work but why not try em they cheap anyways</li>
      <li>It&#x27;d be nice if it came in &amp;#34;jumbo&amp;#34; as well as the regular size.</li>
      <li>IMO-totally worth it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can pay more $$$ on other brands like the nose right and nose magic, but try this instead.</li>
      <li>rIght.</li>
      <li>right I began to see a gradual change.</li>
      <li>right I was considering rhinoplasty.</li>
      <li>when i heard of noseright, i wanted to try it out right away because nose surgery cost like 5 thousand dollars</li>
      <li>Make sure your face has no oils on it and is very clean or it will slip off, other than that it does its job!</li>
      <li>its better to do it while your skin is clean and dry.</li>
      <li>When I researched the surgical process I became more scared of actually having surgery -</li>
      <li>I ordered this Jiahe clip and it has definitely changed my nose shape for the better.</li>
      <li>Work pretty well if I must say.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t spend too much money on these!</li>
      <li>First of all I ordered the two pack.</li>
      <li>Be gentle!</li>
      <li>I bought this since the bone on top of my nose is short</li>
      <li>if you have major changes or a huge nose-</li>
      <li>And your nose, in the middle of your face - is the most important feature and central to the symmetry of the face.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this product is fine for some, but I have a diviated septum and the clip was actually too small to fit around the bone.</li>
      <li>Now I have a huge dent on the left side of my nose.</li>
      <li>Came fast.  </li>
      <li>This contraption is straight up torture.</li>
      <li>These clips REALLY work.</li>
      <li>Maybe it can work as light maintenance against any further growing/widening as can happen with age.</li>
      <li>This really works I leave it on for 25 minutes</li>
      <li>but I dont really see a difference yet.  </li>
      <li>I use for 5 mins or longer and really helps slim the nose.</li>
      <li>Very dissatisfied.</li>
      <li>I would go out, and I wouldn&#x27;t be seen as cute or average.</li>
      <li>This is the (asian)Jiahe Nose up, which looks and more than likely is exactly the same as the american Nose right.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen a SLIGHT change, but a change for sure.</li>
      <li>Less is more here.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m looking forward to see what happens in a few more weeks of wear.</li>
      <li>But overall well worth the price.</li>
      <li>Laugh at it as you might this product is actually functional!</li>
      <li>Nose Up is fantastic and extremely inexpensive - about the cost of a Starbucks.</li>
      <li>This DOES work if you stick with it, because your cartilage is very soft and will change with continuous use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It suposed to softly hold and lift your nose, but I can&#x27;t stand it!</li>
      <li>I used it at first, but I stopped using it because I would get red marks on my nose that would take some time to disappear.  </li>
      <li>If u have old school Michael Jackson nose</li>
      <li>which is straight and symmetrical to my face - and possibly thinner.</li>
      <li>i mean the product  is ok not like</li>
      <li>The pink is okay, but it slightly hurts.</li>
      <li>Gives u a quick fix but definitely doesn&#x27;t last long term ....</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like them, I can barely breath and I wear them for a long time (8 hours a day)</li>
      <li>the white part has now turned yellow, and the white part now wants to stick together even with the one i didn&#x27;t use.  </li>
      <li>These really don&#x27;t do anything for anyone with a bump on their nose, it probably works for those with a wide nose however.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything. I know people who are desperate enough to buy this will hope it will...but it doesn&#x27;t, save your money and buy some gum.</li>
    <li> It got here in about 5 days.  No directions, but all you have to do si clip it onto your nose.  It was not very comfortable the first time I put it on, but now I am used to it.  Ive been using it for about 1 week now. I wear it was long as I can, which is about 15-30minutes at a time.  I think my nose may have gotten smaller but I dont really see a difference yet.  ps: i have a wide nose.    Heres a little something I learned: its better to do it while your skin is clean and dry. If you have oily skin, like me, wash and dry your nose so the clip wont slip off.  And, i have to breathe through my mouth when i wear this.   Its a good deal considering that you get 2 clips, just incase one breaks.  This is the (asian)Jiahe Nose up, which looks and more than likely is exactly the same as the american Nose right.</li>
    <li> Before I knew about the nose right I was considering rhinoplasty. It was going to cost me about 5000 dollars, and spending that amount of money was just not practical before attending college. So I held off. I wouldn&#x27;t say I was ugly through out my years before the nose right, but I always felt as if something was off. My nose wasn&#x27;t horrible, but I always felt it needed a slight change. For quite some time I started to notice I wasnt found as pretty, or merely attractive. It bothered me, and scarred me. I didn&#x27;t find myself as hideous, but that&#x27;s how I was being treated. It was embarrassing and often left me confused. The way I thought I looked, wasn&#x27;t me at all. Once I started wearing the nose right I began to see a gradual change. My tip was slightly bulbous, and my nose was a bit crooked. Those flaws began to vanish after about 2 weeks. My nose was more defined, and it was slimmer. It matched my features beautifully. As my nose changed, so did my confidence. I would go out, and I wouldn&#x27;t be seen as cute or average. I would be seen as gorgeous or stunning. My nose balanced out my face. I could go on and on about the nose rIght. It&#x27;s a life savior. I can now enjoy my life, without always being insecure. Confidence is truly key. I love it, and I highly recommend it. &lt;3</li>
    <li> This really works I leave it on for 25 minutes and my nose is noticeably thinner. I love it</li>
    <li> Hmmm..not sure if it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> Tried this out, not much of a fan of this item.</li>
    <li> I must have been in a weird mood. I used it for a few weeks and realized it was a waste of time nd money.</li>
    <li> I thought this theory would work because several years ago I wore very heavy sunglasses and my nose became enormous with a huge bump and was lower because of the weight of the glasses. Thankfully I realized what was happening and stopped wearing them and my nose eventually went back. My nose was deviated several years later when I was swimming breaststroke and hit the side of the pool head on.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I would need rhinoplasty and even was recently approved for insurance coverage. When I researched the surgical process I became more scared of actually having surgery - it is not like having a haircut! And your nose, in the middle of your face - is the most important feature and central to the symmetry of the face. I thought I would try Nose Up and ordered it on Amazon for dollars. I  can already see an amazing difference! Very subtle which is exactly what I wanted - and it will continue in increments. It is the same theory as elongating the neck, etc. - Slowly but surely it is working and I am thrilled!! Sometimes you just have to think &#x27;Out of the Box&#x27; and work with an original idea. Nose Up is fantastic and extremely inexpensive - about the cost of a Starbucks. I am excited because I will look forward to sculpting my nose to the exact way I&#x27;d like it to look - which is straight and symmetrical to my face - and possibly thinner. It will be interesting to see. I fully recommend this product if you need a slight adjustment such as a straightening. I&#x27;m not sure how it would work for other considerations. I am excited and look forward to feeling pretty again.&lt;br /&gt;Please be sure to use this as it was intended to - for 15 minutes or so a day. Less is more here. I wore the Nose Up for over an hour and there was some swelling. Be gentle!</li>
    <li> I really havent tired it yet cause I barely got it so I dont know what to tell you tbh .</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time. Doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I used it once and it made my nose look slightly thinner already. I know that if I keep doing it, it will permanently become thinner.(: I was using the blue one however, but I actually thought I&#x27;d get two blue ones. The pink is okay, but it slightly hurts. Perhaps because I&#x27;ve been using it incorrectly. Your product is great, though! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and was packed nicely and great customer support. I did see some shaping but the product was to tight and it caused a little pain when I removed them.</li>
    <li> I ordered this Jiahe clip and it has definitely changed my nose shape for the better. I&#x27;ve been wearing it faithfully for several weeks. I&#x27;m told by friends, it made my nose straighter. Looks aside, I can say definitively that the pressure improved some internal problems with my nose and saved me from having to get surgery. I have sinus problems and rinse often with Neil Med sinus rinse during allergy season. Rinsing was effective up to a point, as there was a blockage in my nose on the right side. After using this clip for three days, the clot loosened from the pressure and came out. I can now breathe so much better than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can pay more $$$ on other brands like the nose right and nose magic, but try this instead. This clip takes discipline to see results, so wear it every morning and evening for a good fifteen minutes. It also helps to make sure your nose is oil free (I use hot water and Neutrogena soap) and to warm the silicone parts with hot water before you put the clip on.</li>
    <li> It works! Although, like exercise, you need to be religious to obtain results. Wear it for an hour before applying makeup and it does slim the nose. Nothing permanent but a quick temporary fix. Go ahead and order it.</li>
    <li> It works- you have to wear it daily.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t breath through your nose when wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Believe it or not these clips actually work, I use them everyday for 15 minutes because I wear it around the house they get lost and sometimes just get dirty after awhile so I love these cheap 2 packs so I can keep a supply.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, I thought the price is good, still testing them out. But overall well worth the price. So let&#x27;s hope it does its job.</li>
    <li> its not the price, its the purpose, they are slipping off my nose in like few seconds, can&#x27;t keep them on, I don&#x27;t see, how useful they can be.</li>
    <li> These clips REALLY work. The seller only sent me one instead of 2 that&#x27;s why I give 4 stars instead of five. They take few days to difference but u want the cartlidge in your nose to stay trained/slim w/out clip and that takes few weeks.It depends on what your starting with. If u have old school Michael Jackson nose that&#x27;s months of training.  You need 2-3 clips because if one breaks or the pads come apart u want to have a BACK-UP clip. You have to clean your nose with a toner or alcohol so clip doesn&#x27;t slip off. Wear it like 20 min 2-3 times a day. Sometimes they can be a bit uncomfortable but beauty is pain. Will shop again and buy more products from this seller.</li>
    <li> Product was as I expected it to be. Came within two weeks. I would recommend seller. As far as the product actually working I haven&#x27;t seen any results.</li>
    <li> First of all I ordered the two pack. And they only sent me one. This is why I gave it two stars.</li>
    <li> This nose huggie works for about a minute after leaving it on for a few minutes. I used it for a week now it&#x27;s somewhere in my bathroom drawers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Make sure your face has no oils on it and is very clean or it will slip off, other than that it does its job!</li>
    <li> i mean the product  is ok not like it makes any miracles i only use em once in a great while when i rememnber i have them so i really dont know if they work but why not try em they cheap anyways</li>
    <li> It is little bit hard. When I get it down from my nose after a few minutes, I got two red square on my sides of my nose......</li>
    <li> I love them and it works</li>
    <li> These really don&#x27;t do anything for anyone with a bump on their nose, it probably works for those with a wide nose however. It did me no good sadly.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use these for what they are intended for I use them to clamp my nose for exerices.</li>
    <li> These are a complete waste of money!&lt;br /&gt;They are too tight to the point that I can&#x27;t breathe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say use them for one hour for two weeks and you will see changes all I saw was indents in my nose!</li>
    <li> Gives u a quick fix but definitely doesn&#x27;t last long term ....</li>
    <li> Bought because of the price.. if it didn&#x27;t work, at least it didn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.&lt;br /&gt;Very uncomfortable to leave on longer than 5 minutes, yet to achieve the results you want you need to let it sit for at least an hour a day, everyday.. NO THANKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Into the trash it goes</li>
    <li> I wear mine for 20 minutes a day and it has actually changed the form of my nose. Laugh at it as you might this product is actually functional! I got the idea from a video on You Tube, Carli Bybel website. Love it!</li>
    <li> i cant leave it on for longer than a minute! not only does it hurt, but you cant breathe! i dont see a difference in my nose, but it might be because i cant leave it on long enough. i guess its worth the try though, since its so cheap! oh and shipping took forever!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on, makes a great clip for potato chip bags though. Wasn&#x27;t expecting it to work, glad it was so cheap or I&#x27;d be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Will not change nose to any noticeable degree.  Maybe it can work as light maintenance against any further growing/widening as can happen with age.</li>
    <li> This contraption is straight up torture. The only thing this clip will do is stop blood flow. I turned these little monsters into bag clips for my chips. Work pretty well if I must say.</li>
    <li> These things are amazing when you want to drain your nose and helps over time with the size of your nose.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m saying this...but this product DOES work. I&#x27;ve had it about 2 weeks or so, and I wear it about 5 minutes at a time, 2-3 times a day. I can&#x27;t wear it longer than that because it hurts! and I can&#x27;t stand not being able to breath through my nose. I&#x27;ve seen a SLIGHT change, but a change for sure. I wanted to get a rhinoplasty because of a bulbous tip, but the thought of someone cutting into my face terrifies me. I can see the sides of my nose, near the nostrils, are actually a tad slimmer. there is definition that didn&#x27;t use to be there. It&#x27;s only a few millimeters of a change, but ask any facial surgeon and they&#x27;ll tell you even millimeters matter when it comes to your nose. if you have major changes or a huge nose- don&#x27;t bother. this isn&#x27;t the same as surgery-obviously. but if you&#x27;re looking to make a minor change, give it a try. it&#x27;s only a few bucks, what do you have to lose? IMO-totally worth it. i&#x27;m looking forward to see what happens in a few more weeks of wear.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard of these working for others so I decided to give it a shot. I know a lot of people try this for a couple of weeks then stop and claim it doesn&#x27;t work, I faithfully used it everyday for at least 20 minutes a day (while I was reading/studying/watching TV etc) and I try to move my nostrils every once in awhile with it on (such as flaring and scrunching it). For the first couple weeks I would literally wear this for hours straight, it was painful at first but I got used to it and was able to wear it and forget I&#x27;m wearing it. This DOES work if you stick with it, because your cartilage is very soft and will change with continuous use.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a huge difference, but my nose is slimmer and people can notice. I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and in good condition but there is no instruction on how to use it. So far there has been a slight change on my nose, i&#x27;ll give it a month to see if it will work.</li>
    <li> This does not work, after a while it will leave 2 red marks on the side of your nose.</li>
    <li> I used it at first, but I stopped using it because I would get red marks on my nose that would take some time to disappear.  the white part has now turned yellow, and the white part now wants to stick together even with the one i didn&#x27;t use.  But overall it has a very firm, tight grip if that is what you are looking for.  I honestly dont think that it lifts your nose up, but it does temporary right after you take them off.  I would have kept on using it  for about 5 minutes everyday if it doesn&#x27;t make my skin so red and irritated after it.  I also felt like it would be good if i use it when i was swimming but of course there are separate nose clips for swimming.</li>
    <li> i really recommend this product for every one who has a big nose to become more beautiful and look good guy .</li>
    <li> Maybe it was just the way my nose is shaped, I don&#x27;t know but this was the experience I had.  Not worth the cost of returning though.</li>
    <li> Came fast.  Comfortable but make sure oil is removed on nose or it will slip off. Works as described but will have to use for a long time to see permanent results</li>
    <li> I have been using the nose up lifting beauty clip for about a month now and I don&#x27;t think my nose looks any slimmer. I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> I think the bruises give the illusion of a thinner nose. It created temporary contouring via broken blood vessels haha. No long term effects though... and only do it at night or you&#x27;ll leave the house saying &amp;#34;Hi guys, I had a clip on my nose earlier.&amp;#34; I think you can skip this. Every time you think you want a smaller nose and you start to look up products for it-- set that money aside for rhinoplasty. Upside: you can use these to seal bags closed, not a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> it hurts after a while</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this product is fine for some, but I have a diviated septum and the clip was actually too small to fit around the bone. I always knew I had a wide nose, but I was dissappointed that it was too small for me! It&#x27;d be nice if it came in &amp;#34;jumbo&amp;#34; as well as the regular size. Now I use it as a &amp;#34;snack clip&amp;#34; on half eaten bags of chips. Can&#x27;t be mad -- they were so cheap!</li>
    <li> I bought this since the bone on top of my nose is short so i needed this to help it look pointy and at some point to make it symmetrical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No GREAT result yet since I only use this two times a week. Will probably try doing it daily and will update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No need for me to complain because the price is not that bad.</li>
    <li> I use for 5 mins or longer and really helps slim the nose. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Family suffers from winter nosebleeds and this is easier than pinching your nose for 6 minutes. Be very careful about leaving this on for too long, I remove it after a couple of minutes when it becomes uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> Before noseright, i was really insecure with my nose. Thats what ruined my face the most. when i heard of noseright, i wanted to try it out right away because nose surgery cost like 5 thousand dollars and i watched a vid of a doctor performing nose surgery, it was disgusting -_-. i would do anything besides nose surgery to reshape my nose. i mean i dont have a really ugly nose but its just a bit wide, although most of my friends said that its nothin. i used noseright for at least a month already and i saw a huge difference. im definitely satisfied with this product! it made my nose smaller and prettier :) i want to thank the person who made this product!</li>
    <li> This product made my nose cave in. Now I have a huge dent on the left side of my nose.</li>
    <li> It suposed to softly hold and lift your nose, but I can&#x27;t stand it! it hurts! Good thing I didn&#x27;t spend too much money on these!</li>
    <li> cheap... doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> These work ok. Not to crazy or don&#x27;t hate this product. It sure does thin your nose but if left to long it can create pressure marks on your skin. Careful.</li>
    <li> A total waste didn&#x27;t work..</li>
    <li> i guess this will work if you have patience similar to Job of the Old Testament. i do not. however, i can see a VERY slight difference after about three weeks. i&#x27;ll just pray i can afford plastic surgery someday.</li>
    <li> Seems to work but you have to wear it a long time. Cheaper than a nose job.</li>
    <li> Hello, the item I received today doesn&#x27;t even open. It&#x27;s as if the clips are glued together. Once I finally got the clips open the cushioned part for my nose had fallen off.!! Very dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like them, I can barely breath and I wear them for a long time (8 hours a day) and I haven&#x27;t seen any changes yet. Rulav its much better! :S</li>
