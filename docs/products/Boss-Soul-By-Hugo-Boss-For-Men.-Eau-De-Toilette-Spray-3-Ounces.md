      <li>Husband&#x27;s favorite!</li>
      <li>so i saw so many good ones of this one but to be honest with all of you</li>
      <li>nice</li>
      <li>I really liked this product.</li>
      <li>Everything is nice.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is not a casual cologne, but rather one best used in the evenings, especially in slightly more formal situations.  </li>
      <li>If you want a soft fragrance that lasts all day, you have to buy the Boss Soul which is excellent.</li>
      <li>not so strong, not so light, really really good smell, is not intoxicating</li>
      <li>This is my cryptonite, I absolutely love this.</li>
      <li>Looking forward to more Boss perfumes.</li>
      <li>smells great sticks to you the whole day at work what else could i ask for?</li>
      <li>I would buy it again for sure.</li>
      <li>I recommend this perfun.i love it</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite cologne.  </li>
      <li>This one is in the top two for sure.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this parfume.</li>
      <li>The price was okay.  </li>
      <li>my husbend likes it as well:)</li>
      <li>Excellent product seems to last for hours.  </li>
      <li>Smells great and arrived fast.</li>
      <li>Nice, high quality product for decent price, satisfied, do recommend!!!</li>
      <li>It just not a pungent/strong type,I would said it&#x27;s soft and attractive smell</li>
      <li>I liked this product very much.</li>
      <li>I love being able to purchase this on Amazon and have it shipped right to my home, saves on having to take a trip to the mall.</li>
      <li>While I don&#x27;t consider this to be an every day cologne, it does make a very nice addition to the collection and works very well in the right situations.</li>
      <li>Certainly, HB Soul is a COOL but strong cologne,&lt;br /&gt;Cologne lovers: buy it, spray it and have more cats around !</li>
      <li>Seems genuine from what we could tell.</li>
      <li>but the smell is light</li>
      <li>Very nice for daily use.</li>
      <li>The smell is just right, not too strong not too sweet.</li>
      <li>However, that quickly fades, and what lingers is a suprisingly pleasant and mysterious scent which I would describe as a chocolate wood smell with a hint of cinnamon.  </li>
      <li>I love the Hugo Boss brand in general, but this was is definitely my favorite one.</li>
      <li>cool</li>
      <li>i love it thanks alot</li>
      <li>i bought this product it is not bad</li>
      <li>This item is ok but will never buy it again, anyway thank you Hugo Boss for several compliments I recieved becouse of you :)</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s good for a contemporary gentleman, since young men might prefer something lighter!</li>
      <li>mmm Smell really good and stay on your body all night long...</li>
      <li>When first applied, it has a overbearingly strong orange pepper scent that isn&#x27;t really to my liking.  </li>
      <li>Shipped very fast...</li>
      <li>this is the first Boss perfume I have got.</li>
      <li>Bought this first at TJ Maxx.</li>
      <li>I really really like Boss Soul.</li>
      <li>It is a real man&#x27;s scent.</li>
      <li>so I decided to give a try to this one but didn&#x27;t not like it that much.</li>
      <li>and I liked it, but its not stays long enough</li>
      <li>i will say this is just a normal Toilette Spray.</li>
      <li>itts got a unique fragrance which is long lasting</li>
      <li>The smell didn&#x27;t last much</li>
      <li>I really like this one however it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
      <li>We&#x27;re currently processing your review and we will email you as soon as at justino_trompetero@hotmail.com this is complete.</li>
      <li>The bottle arrived in the box but the spray top was broken off, causing it to leak everywhere and get all over your hands when you spray it.</li>
      <li>The sprayer is broken and the perfume leaked already from the top of the bottle.</li>
      <li>The perfume Boss Soul by Hugo Boss, Eau de toilette spray 3 ounces  for men arrived broken in i the top and open.</li>

    <li> Started buying this for my husband a few years ago and also purchased for my dad. I love being able to purchase this on Amazon and have it shipped right to my home, saves on having to take a trip to the mall.</li>
    <li> This smell last for a day if you are not running around/outdoor person. It just not a pungent/strong type,I would said it&#x27;s soft and attractive smell and yet it serves as deodorant.:)&lt;br /&gt;4.5 out of 5</li>
    <li> I have used almost all of the Boss fragrances for men over the years and have yet to find one I didn&#x27;t like. This one is in the top two for sure. It&#x27;s not flowery and not musky. It is a real man&#x27;s scent.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this scent, and I found it here cheaper than the usual place we get it.  Arrived quickly, no issues.  Seems genuine from what we could tell.</li>
    <li> This is my third bottle and I have dozen others but this I keep going back to. Excellent fragrance.</li>
    <li> I am using this daily for my office and I liked it, but its not stays long enough that&#x27;s the reason i gave 3 stars</li>
    <li> This item is ok but will never buy it again, anyway thank you Hugo Boss for several compliments I recieved becouse of you :)</li>
    <li> I like it&lt;br /&gt;thank you so much&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate your product its awesome&lt;br /&gt;good job&lt;br /&gt;keep it up forever&lt;br /&gt;so cool</li>
    <li> When first applied, it has a overbearingly strong orange pepper scent that isn&#x27;t really to my liking.  However, that quickly fades, and what lingers is a suprisingly pleasant and mysterious scent which I would describe as a chocolate wood smell with a hint of cinnamon.  This is a gourmand with a touch of class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a casual cologne, but rather one best used in the evenings, especially in slightly more formal situations.  I find it lasts a bit longer than some of the other Hugo products.  While I don&#x27;t consider this to be an every day cologne, it does make a very nice addition to the collection and works very well in the right situations.</li>
    <li> Smells great and arrived fast. Purchased it as a valentine&#x27;s day gift for my fianc&amp;eacute; and he loved it!! Would order again</li>
    <li> The bottle arrived in the box but the spray top was broken off, causing it to leak everywhere and get all over your hands when you spray it.</li>
    <li> I always like to raed the reviews before i buy one product so i saw so many good ones of this one but to be honest with all of you i will say this is just a normal Toilette Spray.</li>
    <li> The perfume Boss Soul by Hugo Boss, Eau de toilette spray 3 ounces  for men arrived broken in i the top and open.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite cologne.  It is woodsy and long lasting.  The rumor is that Boss is dropping it from its line.  That&#x27;s a shame.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this parfume. It has masuline smell. very good and sofisticated. my husbend likes it as well:)</li>
    <li> Nice, high quality product for decent price, satisfied, do recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried different Hugo Boss colognes before so I decided to give a try to this one but didn&#x27;t not like it that much. The smell didn&#x27;t last much</li>
    <li> There was plastic wrapping on the box and when I opened it, the bottle was leaking. The bottle leaks when it is tilted. Seems its not sealed correctly.</li>
    <li> i love it thanks alot</li>
    <li> Received a damaged product. The sprayer is broken and the perfume leaked already from the top of the bottle. Tried to return this item but there is no return option.</li>
    <li> I really really like Boss Soul. The problem I have always had with Soul is it doesn&#x27;t last, So I&#x27;ve made Armani Code my #1 fragrance. I have since solved the issue of how long it lasts by obtaining one of those little Travalo fragrance atomizers  so I can freshen up anytime I like. Very nice fragrance, and the price was irresistible.</li>
    <li> Perfect delivery time, the product it&#x27;s like the description seller, but the best thing is, this it&#x27;s a original soul by hugo boss. mmm Smell really good and stay on your body all night long... Awesome product!!</li>
    <li> Bought this first at TJ Maxx. I love the Hugo Boss brand in general, but this was is definitely my favorite one. Paid $40.00 for 1.6oz. This seems like a steal! You definitely wont regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 2 in my arsenal that I must have: the Hugo Boss Soul and the Lacoste Red Style</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000C1VXNA Boss Soul By Hugo Boss For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3 Ounces]]&lt;br /&gt;  very good colony</li>
    <li> nice but the smell is light</li>
    <li> Excellent product seems to last for hours.  I have always like the boss products.  The price was okay.  Shipped very fast...</li>
    <li> excelente perfume lo recomiendo.. me gusta mucho el aroma.. lo entregaron antes del tiempo indicado excelente muchas gracias.. recomendado 100%</li>

    <li> I really like this one however it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> i bought this product it is not bad it is badest the badest ,horrible its doesnt last for 30 min my decision never to buy from amazon any fragances</li>
    <li> Husband&#x27;s favorite! I don&#x27;t understand why they stop making them. The smell is just right, not too strong not too sweet.</li>
    <li> If you want a soft fragrance that lasts all day, you have to buy the Boss Soul which is excellent. You can buy with confidence that you will not lose your money. Excellent!</li>
    <li> I liked this product very much. Excellent prize. Very nice for daily use. I would buy it again for sure.</li>
    <li> This perfume is excellent.. this is the first Boss perfume I have got. Looking forward to more Boss perfumes. itts got a unique fragrance which is long lasting</li>
    <li> not so strong, not so light, really really good smell, is not intoxicating, you will let your touch where you are</li>
    <li> excellent gift for a boyfriend, delicious scent and also quite sensuous. I think it&#x27;s good for a contemporary gentleman, since young men might prefer something lighter!</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. Excellent quality. The product is identical to that described by the supplier.</li>
