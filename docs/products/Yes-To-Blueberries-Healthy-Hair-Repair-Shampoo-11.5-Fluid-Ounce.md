      <li>It is vegan if that is important.</li>
      <li>We all want to be good to ourselves using natural products.</li>
      <li>but I really don&#x27;t mind it since I love the shampoo.</li>
      <li>and if I really wanted to love what the shampoo did for my hair</li>
      <li>It gets my hair clean and leaves it feeling fresh, and that is all I care about.</li>
      <li>I normally use Yes To Cucumbers shampoo and have been pretty happy with the results, but I was hoping for something that would leave my color-treated, dry hair feeling a bit softer and more moisturized.</li>
      <li>Love the smell, and my hair is very soft with this product</li>
      <li>This is the first shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used that truly makes my hair feel clean -</li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll try another kind next.</li>
      <li>but I was looking for something more natural.  </li>
      <li>hair is short, very fine, wavy, and is color treated.</li>
      <li>I have very, very fine hair that breaks constantly, and I feel like using this shampoo</li>
      <li>The scent is kinda strong while you&#x27;re shampooing, but after it&#x27;s rinsed and dried, it&#x27;s a very light to nonexistent scent.</li>
      <li>When I first used the shampoo I was in the shower having that</li>
      <li>but I am pretty sure that is just about the same thing...</li>
      <li>works great for short or long hair.</li>
      <li>I am on my first week with the shampoo and conditioner</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only just started using this shampoo, but my hair looks better already.</li>
      <li>Love this company and especially the hair line</li>
      <li>The only thing is I wish it smelled better</li>
      <li>Instead, it&#x27;s just CLEAN but still has its natural oils!</li>
      <li>It makes my hair feel clean and soft.  </li>
      <li>Then the conditioner really complemented the duo and felt very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>It had a very plastic smell to it.</li>
      <li>really hope they never stop making this.  </li>
      <li>I had to spend so much money (Aveda).  </li>
      <li>But this does make it alot easier to start being gentle to your hair.</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t really repair your hair.</li>
      <li>I really like this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I really like this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I have found other shampoos that were OK</li>
      <li>I love the smell, and when I have to switch back to a different shampoo for whatever reason, I can really tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Was not sure if I would like it but had tried the conditioner from another store and liked it</li>
      <li>I mean, I&#x27;ve used a lot of shampoo that cleaned my hair, but the first time I used this, my hair felt clean, soft, and light (does that makes sense?)</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t foam as much either, which was weird at first, but still went into my hair nicely.</li>
      <li>My favorite thing is that the ingredients are friendly and it is hard to find a natural or organic hair care that actually exceeds expectations.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t that great to be honest, but also not the worst I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>My hair went from feeling like a hay bale to feeling as soft as baby hair!</li>
      <li>I am surprised that Yes To Blueberries leave my hair even softer!</li>
      <li>It rinses clearly and leaves my hair very soft and shiny.  </li>
      <li>soft and silky results.</li>
      <li>Both have an very herbal smell because of the rosemary and other natural ingredients in it.</li>
      <li>They leave my hair very soft, compared to other brands I&#x27;ve tried (even high end salon brands).</li>
      <li>I bought it for it&#x27;s all natural ingredients, and the fact that it&#x27;s free of parabens and other harsh chemicals.</li>
      <li>It does not dry out the hair, and has virtually no smell.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping this shampoo and the conditioner will help repair my hair from the light damage caused by chemical processing with a blonde hair kit and flat ironing a couple of times over the past couple of months.</li>

<li> In the past, Pantene was the only one that leaves my hair soft</li>
<li> This has left my hair softer and less frizzy than other regular big brand shampoos.</li>
<li> It should be noted that I let my hair get almost completely dry before hitting it with the hair dryer -- if you dry your hair immediately, you probably will need conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The YTB shampoo left my hair feeling a bit greasy and weighed down but not any softer or moisturized.</li>
<li> It is good for my hair, but it makes my scalp itch so badly!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little bit thinner than regular shampoos.</li>
<li> bought it due to a review that said it worked well without sodium laurel sulfate.  </li>
<li> Seems to be calming my frizz slowly and not stripping my hair dry like other shampoos.</li>
<li> (I dilute it slightly in another bottle.)</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t call it a blueberry smell but yummy none the less.</li>
<li> But just after one washing, my hair looked smoother, shinier, and had less tangles.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not rich</li>
<li> I bought it because there are few affordable options for paraben and sulfate-free hair care.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed because it felt like it stripped my hair more than other shampoos I have</li>
<li> /&gt;Overall I am not impressed with this product.</li>
<li> and you feel ripped off for spending your hard earned money on a disappointment!</li>
<li> I won&#x27;t be buying this again unfortunately :(</li>
<li> You get this and its crap</li>
<li> has helped it not be so terrible.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this and the conditioner and love them both.  I also like the Yes-to-carrots so I switch between the two.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, and my hair is very soft with this product</li>
    <li> We all want to be good to ourselves using natural products. You get this and its crap and you feel ripped off for spending your hard earned money on a disappointment!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while.  It does not dry out the hair, and has virtually no smell.  I think it is a very good product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff and so does my hair.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t really repair your hair. It feels fine, lathers OK, smells like Fruit Loops cereal. I bought it because there are few affordable options for paraben and sulfate-free hair care. I&#x27;m going to keep looking.</li>
    <li> Love this company and especially the hair line</li>
    <li> I normally use Yes To Cucumbers shampoo and have been pretty happy with the results, but I was hoping for something that would leave my color-treated, dry hair feeling a bit softer and more moisturized. This wasn&#x27;t what I was hoping for. The YTB shampoo left my hair feeling a bit greasy and weighed down but not any softer or moisturized. Although this doesn&#x27;t contain any silicone, it left my scalp feeling itchy as if I were using a product that did. To me the scent wasn&#x27;t pleasant either. It had a very plastic smell to it. So I went back to my YTC shampoo.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. The lather is good and I love the smell. The conditioner is HG, but this is nothing to sneeze at.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only just started using this shampoo, but my hair looks better already. I bought it for it&#x27;s all natural ingredients, and the fact that it&#x27;s free of parabens and other harsh chemicals. But just after one washing, my hair looked smoother, shinier, and had less tangles. I will definitely continue to use this shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice - reminds me of lemon bars - and has a good lather.</li>
    <li> this stuff is great. it definatly works wonders. works great for short or long hair. soft and silky results. wonderful</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It smells wonderful and works fantastically. I am excited to try more of their products now!</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo.  It makes my hair feel clean and soft.  I can even see the difference.  I have found other shampoos that were OK and if I really wanted to love what the shampoo did for my hair I had to spend so much money (Aveda).  I&#x27;m not rich but I care about my hair and well my sister told me to try this and I&#x27;m happy I did.</li>
    <li> Was not sure if I would like it but had tried the conditioner from another store and liked it so I thought I should try the shampoo to go along with it. I like it a lot. Works well for my hair. Protects your hair shaft and makes it feel silky !</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo, and the carrots line!</li>
    <li> Love it! My short pixie cut is silky &amp; shiny!</li>
    <li> My hair went from feeling like a hay bale to feeling as soft as baby hair!</li>
    <li> It left buildup in my hair. It wasn&#x27;t that great to be honest, but also not the worst I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I tried this after using the &amp;#34;yes to tomatoes&amp;#34; shampoo and conditioner. I think perhaps the tomatoes one makes my hair a bit nicer but the fragrance was overpowering. Maybe I&#x27;ll try another kind next.</li>
    <li> I had a friend turn me on to this while staying with them on vacation.  It is vegan if that is important. It is very clean and no additives. It gets my hair clean and leaves it feeling fresh, and that is all I care about.</li>
    <li> My hair has never looked better since I started using this.  The only thing is I wish it smelled better but I really don&#x27;t mind it since I love the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought several products from the Yes To brand because they don&#x27;t contain any Sodium Laurel Sulfate or Parabens. This shampoo uses something called Sodium Coco Sulfate which is derived from coconuts so it still lathers without chemicals. I always use this shampoo with its matching conditioner and the combination of the two leaves my hair silky and shiny.</li>
    <li> This is the first shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used that truly makes my hair feel clean - I mean, I&#x27;ve used a lot of shampoo that cleaned my hair, but the first time I used this, my hair felt clean, soft, and light (does that makes sense?) and even after using it for months, it still feels the same.  I have very, very fine hair that breaks constantly, and I feel like using this shampoo has helped it not be so terrible.  I love the smell, and when I have to switch back to a different shampoo for whatever reason, I can really tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hope they never stop making this.  I ended up giving it a shot because Say Yes to Tomatoes became unavailable, and though I loved that one too this is worlds better.</li>
    <li> I have Mazani type 5 curls, and this shampoo by far is the best I have ever used--I have been using it for six months now and it leaves my hair so soft, I can comb it out with no tangles or nots (this is without using a conditioner).  And it leaves my hair strong.</li>
    <li> It is good for my hair, but it makes my scalp itch so badly! I won&#x27;t be buying this again unfortunately :(</li>
    <li> I am on my first week with the shampoo and conditioner and I just love them both. I bought this on a whim because I like blueberries and did not expect it to be that great. When I first used the shampoo I was in the shower having that yes yes YES moment. It lathers nicely and smells good and had a nice slip to it but felt like it was cleaning my hair. When I rinsed the shampoo off, my hair felt smoother already. Then the conditioner really complemented the duo and felt very moisturizing. My hair seems to feel softer and look nice after. My favorite thing is that the ingredients are friendly and it is hard to find a natural or organic hair care that actually exceeds expectations. Listen, its not going to fix your hair into something that it&#x27;s not, but that is what haircuts are for. But this does make it alot easier to start being gentle to your hair. I use to dread going to shower but now I feel excited!!! Please don&#x27;t discontinue or change ingredients in this product!</li>
    <li> Somehow I accidentally bought this shampoo thinking it was the conditioner instead.  I love the yes to blueberries hair conditioner. I think the shampoo is okay, but will stick with the conditioner instead. Both this shampoo and the conditioner to well together. I don&#x27;t think I will buy the shampoo again.  But I will buy the conditioner again. Both have an very herbal smell because of the rosemary and other natural ingredients in it. I&#x27;m hoping this shampoo and the conditioner will help repair my hair from the light damage caused by chemical processing with a blonde hair kit and flat ironing a couple of times over the past couple of months.</li>
    <li> I really love the Yes to Blueberries Shampoo/Conditioner combination. They leave my hair very soft, compared to other brands I&#x27;ve tried (even high end salon brands). In the past, Pantene was the only one that leaves my hair soft but I prefer something &amp;#34;greener&amp;#34;. I am surprised that Yes To Blueberries leave my hair even softer!</li>
    <li> This shampoo does it&#x27;s job but is nothing remarkable.  Before I tried this shampoo I used john frida products but I was looking for something more natural.  I was very disappointed because it felt like it stripped my hair more than other shampoos I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it due to a review that said it worked well without sodium laurel sulfate.  However, it does contain sodium coco sulfate, I am no chemist but I am pretty sure that is just about the same thing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am not impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> I rotate among several shampoos, and this is always on hand.  It rinses clearly and leaves my hair very soft and shiny.  (I dilute it slightly in another bottle.) On humid days, I don&#x27;t even need conditioner.  It should be noted that I let my hair get almost completely dry before hitting it with the hair dryer -- if you dry your hair immediately, you probably will need conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is short, very fine, wavy, and is color treated.</li>
    <li> Amazing shampoo. SLS free. Terrific smell. Seems to be calming my frizz slowly and not stripping my hair dry like other shampoos. Instead, it&#x27;s just CLEAN but still has its natural oils! Use with the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. It&#x27;s a little bit thinner than regular shampoos. It doesn&#x27;t foam as much either, which was weird at first, but still went into my hair nicely. The scent is kinda strong while you&#x27;re shampooing, but after it&#x27;s rinsed and dried, it&#x27;s a very light to nonexistent scent. This has left my hair softer and less frizzy than other regular big brand shampoos.</li>
    <li> My hair feels so good after use &amp; it smells delicious.  I wouldn&#x27;t call it a blueberry smell but yummy none the less.</li>
