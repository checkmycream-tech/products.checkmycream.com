      <li>Been taking these a week now, joints feel a touch better and no fishy burps.</li>

      <li>No bad side effects.  </li>
      <li>I just got back my latest labs from the annual physical and this stuff works great.  </li>
      <li>I will give them another chance, but if it happens again I will have to look for a source of fresh products.</li>
      <li>I am actually confident that this brand isn&#x27;t the only good one out there, but it&#x27;s the only one I use.</li>
      <li>The capsules are so soft, I love taking them.</li>
      <li>Buyer beware:  the prices set for these \\&quot;value\\&quot; packs is actually much higher than if you were to buy the bottles individually (a bit over $15 each on their own).</li>
      <li>The capsule is soft and easy to swallow.  </li>
      <li>The soft gels are easy to swallow and there is no fishy aftertaste because they are made with algae not fish oil.  </li>
      <li>As a vegetarian I really want to get the right amount of EFAs without having to ingest fish.  </li>
      <li>It is a vegetarian Omega 3 supplement that is higher in DHA than most other supplements I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
      <li>Prior to the pregnancy, this product was fine.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s also reassuring to know that the product is 100% free of PCBs and mercury because the plant sources are grown outside of the ocean.  </li>
      <li>I have told other friends about it and their joints feel better also.  </li>
      <li>No bad burps or tastes later.</li>
      <li>So glad this product exists, and no funny aftertaste!</li>
      <li>These are a great vegan omega product which is difficult to find elsewhere.</li>
      <li>These actually taste nice - slightly herbal.</li>
      <li>This product seems to wake up my lazy head and give me a bit more energy.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll go in for a blood test in about 6 months to see if it&#x27;s helping with my overall cholesterol reading, particularly the LDL cholesterol readings.</li>
      <li>They contain higher amounts of EPA/DHA then other fish oil alternative capsules that I have  found.</li>
      <li>We take two soft gels daily.</li>
      <li>I realize bad things happen sometimes during manufacturing and bottling, but good QA should catch it</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love that I can get vegetarian supplements at Amazon.  Great for us with sensitivities.  This product seems to wake up my lazy head and give me a bit more energy.  I will continue using it, as I have for the last 3 months.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and does not smell fishy</li>
    <li> These actually taste nice - slightly herbal. No bad burps or tastes later.</li>
    <li> Good source of Omega 3 if you have a fish/seafood allergy.  No bad side effects.  Excellent value, quick shipping.  I take these regularly.</li>
    <li> I just got back my latest labs from the annual physical and this stuff works great.  I like it better than the DEVA brand cause it doesn&#x27;t smell (which never bothered me) and has more amount of EPA/DHA.</li>
    <li> Some damaged capsules were in one bottle; the results were unpleasant.  I realize bad things happen sometimes during manufacturing and bottling, but good QA should catch it; I don&#x27;t want to deal with it.</li>
    <li> These are a great vegan omega product which is difficult to find elsewhere.I would recommend these to anyone looking for a vegan source of omega-3 made from the algae that actually supplies the omega-3. It&#x27;s also a sustainable source .</li>
    <li> This is working great for me so far. I&#x27;ll go in for a blood test in about 6 months to see if it&#x27;s helping with my overall cholesterol reading, particularly the LDL cholesterol readings. I&#x27;m hoping this will help.</li>
    <li> My wife and I take these Ovega vegetarian capsules regularly. Good, reliable product and delivery.</li>
    <li> Great choice for people who have fish (fish oil) allergies.</li>
    <li> I was told that Ovega-3 was better than Omega 3/Krill oil.  Since I started taking 1 pill a day for over 6 months now my left knee no longer pops out.  I have told other friends about it and their joints feel better also.  I will continue to promote this product.  JLG</li>
    <li> I am pleased with these capsules. They contain higher amounts of EPA/DHA then other fish oil alternative capsules that I have  found. I am a repeat buyer of this product.</li>
    <li> No aftertaste and is a great Vegan alternative</li>
    <li> Great product and fast delivery.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> Love the algae-based source of this DHA + EPA Omega-3 supplement.  It surely does not have fishy smell and aftertaste.  It&#x27;s also reassuring to know that the product is 100% free of PCBs and mercury because the plant sources are grown outside of the ocean.  As a vegetarian I have been trying to get Omega-3 from chia seeds, but Ovega-3 makes it more convenient.  The capsule is soft and easy to swallow.  I have been taking it during pregnancy, so far all checkups are great and baby is very healthy.  My only concern is the leaking capsule -- so far the two bottles I have consumed contain some sticky capsules due to leakage, some of them even get stuck to the bottom of the bottle.  Wish Amerifit can enhance its quality control.</li>
    <li> Last order damaged and rancid. When we went to return them after opening, received notice that the return window was closed. If I buy these again, I will not buy two at a time since it means that if the second bottle is damaged, it will not be possible to return it. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> I purchased a two pack and one of them was rancid. All the capsules stuck together. I have ordered this product from Amerifit Brands many times, and this is the first time it happened. I will give them another chance, but if it happens again I will have to look for a source of fresh products.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t go back to fish oil. I just figure, going to the original source of omega-3&#x27;s is the best. I am actually confident that this brand isn&#x27;t the only good one out there, but it&#x27;s the only one I use. The capsules are so soft, I love taking them.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast. Been taking these a week now, joints feel a touch better and no fishy burps.</li>
    <li> Great product: good concentration of DHA and EPA from a vegan source. No fishy taste!</li>
    <li> Re - ordered these twice as they appear to be helping my husband.</li>
    <li> We take two soft gels daily. We can see a difference in our dryness of our eyes and skin has changed for the better. The nice thing about Ovega is it is more of a pure form of Omega-3. No fishy aftertaste!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking Ovega-3 since prior to and during my pregnancy. Prior to the pregnancy, this product was fine. During the pregnancy, I&#x27;ve had to freeze the entire bottle because the smell is unbearable to me. Even after freezing, I have difficulty swallowing this pill due to the smell.</li>
    <li> Love the idea of vegetarian Omega-3 but I don&#x27;t want to deal with broken and nasty capsules any more. My wife and I are vegetarians and began using this product about a year ago. Things were fine until the last two orders where three of the four bottles had broken capsules and a nasty smell. Not sure if something changed in their production process or in the warehousing but I&#x27;m not going to take the risk of getting bad product any longer.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware:  the prices set for these \\&quot;value\\&quot; packs is actually much higher than if you were to buy the bottles individually (a bit over $15 each on their own).</li>
    <li> Great find, and working very well as a replacement for Fish Oil Gels. Very impressed with the results in my latest blood test, after 3 months of use.</li>
    <li> I love this product and would give this a full five stars if the price were a bit better. This is a great alternative for those allergic to seafood.</li>
    <li> The capsules often leak and make everything in the bottle oily and smelly.  I still use, but am not able to put them in daily medicine dispenser as they make other vitamins taste bad. On trips, I have to take both containers now.  Can you do anything about it?</li>
    <li> Best omega 3 I&#x27;ve ever used. No fishy taste,because it&#x27;s vegetarian. I wanted a supplement that tasted good and worked.Ovega 3 does both.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dietitian and always recommend this product to patients.  It is a vegetarian Omega 3 supplement that is higher in DHA than most other supplements I&#x27;ve found.  I always encourage clients to check the amount of DHA per capsule when comparing products.  You may find a cheaper product out there, but likely not with the same concentration of DHA.  The soft gels are easy to swallow and there is no fishy aftertaste because they are made with algae not fish oil.  These are also suitable for use during pregnancy.</li>
    <li> As a vegetarian I really want to get the right amount of EFAs without having to ingest fish.  So glad this product exists, and no funny aftertaste!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad there&#x27;s an alternative to fish oil.  This product is great.</li>
    <li> No fishy taste but does cost a bit more.Great vegetarian source of DHA</li>
    <li> Ordered 2 pack.&lt;br /&gt;Recieved only one.</li>
