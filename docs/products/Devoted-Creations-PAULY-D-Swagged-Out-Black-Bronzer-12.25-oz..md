      <li>Im in Love with this stuff....</li>
      <li>I love the bronze color it creates without making me too orange.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use this more than once a week, or you might start to turn orange.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent heavy bronzer.</li>
      <li>I am a seasonal tanner with my own tanning bed and this is by far my favorite lotion.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend, make sure you wipe your hands after u apply!</li>
      <li>The color payoff is worth the funky smell, though.</li>
      <li>Good stuff, dark tan.</li>

      <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
      <li>You see color from first use.</li>
      <li>Seems to work ok but the bronzer will turn your hands orange and in between the fingers will be a gross brown color.</li>
      <li>Then found it on line at a large savings.</li>
      <li>I have smelled the real snagged out before.</li>
      <li>Wife really enjoys it</li>
      <li>A lot of them smell about the same, because of the high amount of dihydroxyacetone (self-tanner), so the smell wasn&#x27;t a huge issue to me.</li>
      <li>use a high pressure bed.&lt;br</li>
      <li>WOW</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like the smell, can&#x27;t not express this enough.</li>
      <li>however if you don&#x27;t switch lotions it will turn you orange unless you have a natural tan body to start with.</li>
      <li>Keeps you a normal looking dark brown for longer, smells a lot better than other products before and after tanning.</li>
      <li>Dj Pauly Ds cheeper version called sexy black bronzer and paid for the more expensive one that I wanted.</li>
      <li>i was curious about getting a fast tan cause</li>
      <li>It gets me darker than any other and twice as fast.</li>
      <li>Had trouble getting the right shade overall.  </li>

<li> This lotion will stay in my rotation for a long time.</li>
<li> This lotion definitely brings out the color faster than other bronzers I am using.</li>
<li> However i am really white and had to use other lotions for awhile before switching to this one</li>
<li> im so dark, still wearing my tan 1 week later!</li>
<li> I got the same results as a medium spray tan, and I got a lot of compliments on how dark I was.</li>
<li> I was not sure If I was gonna go with Pauly D or Jwow, the lady at the tanning bed told me they were selling out of the big bottles and had 1 pack left</li>
<li> Product was not real.</li>
<li> I was expecting to get Dj Pauly Ds swagged out black bronzer.</li>
<li> In the two times i have used it the smell is bothering me less, but it has devolped my tan better.&lt;br</li>
<li> If heavy bronzers are your thing, check out Ed Hardy&#x27;s Black Elixir and Devoted Creations&#x27; Couture Noir as well.</li>
<li> I can put up with the smell for a few months to get that tan, FYI</li>
<li> I&#x27;m so pale but after 2 SESSIONS of tanning for 20mins</li>
<li> Must have for the serious tanner!</li>
<li> sadly the smell.</li>
<li> but I am unable to do that at the tanning spa once I am already lotioned up for my tanning session.</li>
<li> The product I recieved was the wrong product!</li>
<li> TERRIBLE PRODUCT.</li>

    <li> i was curious about getting a fast tan cause I&#x27;m so pale but after 2 SESSIONS of tanning for 20mins im so dark, still wearing my tan 1 week later! Highly recommend, make sure you wipe your hands after u apply!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell, can&#x27;t not express this enough. I bought this for my wedding so i don&#x27;t look like a ghost wearing a ivory dress. It gives you a great color and feels great! sadly the smell. If this is was Pauly D smells like no wonder they aren&#x27;t on the telly. I can put up with the smell for a few months to get that tan, FYI i work in a cave so I am extra pasty white! In the two times i have used it the smell is bothering me less, but it has devolped my tan better.&lt;br /&gt;key facts:&lt;br /&gt;I am a skin type 3&lt;br /&gt;go mon, wen, fri (or plan on those days)&lt;br /&gt;I use a high pressure bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also if you plan on buying this buy online!!! 1/3 the price</li>
    <li> Good product. Wife really enjoys it</li>
    <li> Best bang for your buck,  this stuff works.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t streak, smells good, but will stain your hands so wash after applying.</li>
    <li> The product I recieved was the wrong product! I was expecting to get Dj Pauly Ds swagged out black bronzer. Instead I got Dj Pauly Ds cheeper version called sexy black bronzer and paid for the more expensive one that I wanted. I have time and time again ordered for Amazon and not once have had a problem with anything but this time i did! Use caution when buying!</li>
    <li> Great love this product tattoo Protector and great color</li>
    <li> best s*** I ever used</li>
    <li> Keeps you a normal looking dark brown for longer, smells a lot better than other products before and after tanning.</li>
    <li> I am a seasonal tanner with my own tanning bed and this is by far my favorite lotion. It gets me darker than any other and twice as fast. I love the bronze color it creates without making me too orange.</li>
    <li> Bought to tan with because of the tattoo ink protectant.  Highly recommended!! Works as described!!! Would use again! Lots cheaper than the price the tanning salon wanted.</li>
    <li> Good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jedi disks Josh&#x27;s Josh&#x27;s Isis Josh&#x27;s hehs disb FCC FoC ins hav dsc USB RBI it rt a bvu</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I was looking for and works great! There is no bad odor after tanning and within one use, I was much darker</li>
    <li> Great lotion! Smells amazing! Awesome deal! Works better than any lotion ive ever used! Must have for the serious tanner!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent heavy bronzer. A lot of them smell about the same, because of the high amount of dihydroxyacetone (self-tanner), so the smell wasn&#x27;t a huge issue to me. You will however, reek of DHA after tanning since it&#x27;s loaded with it. So don&#x27;t use this on a day you have to be around a lot of people. The color payoff is worth the funky smell, though. I got the same results as a medium spray tan, and I got a lot of compliments on how dark I was. I wouldn&#x27;t use this more than once a week, or you might start to turn orange. Definitely wash your hands immediately after applying, or they will stain. If heavy bronzers are your thing, check out Ed Hardy&#x27;s Black Elixir and Devoted Creations&#x27; Couture Noir as well.</li>
    <li> Seems to work ok but the bronzer will turn your hands orange and in between the fingers will be a gross brown color. The manufacturer recommends washing so this does not happen but I am unable to do that at the tanning spa once I am already lotioned up for my tanning session.</li>
    <li> Product was not real. Paul d products do not stink this lotion stunk. I have smelled the real snagged out before. The scent was nothing like the bottle i purchased here. Would have give a 0 but couldn&#x27;t rate then. TERRIBLE PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Had trouble getting the right shade overall.  Then found this at a tanning salon bought it.  Then found it on line at a large savings. WOW</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion for my son and within three days he was so tan! Very happy with this product, he has gotten many compliments.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing.... however if you don&#x27;t switch lotions it will turn you orange unless you have a natural tan body to start with. However i am really white and had to use other lotions for awhile before switching to this one so i didn&#x27;t come out looking like a pumpkin.</li>
    <li> Always delivers quickly and this product is amazing! You see color from first use.</li>
    <li> I bought a pack of this lotion at my tanning salon to try out I was not sure If I was gonna go with Pauly D or Jwow, the lady at the tanning bed told me they were selling out of the big bottles and had 1 pack left I used it and it was excellent made me look way darker way darker!!!!!! I ordered on Amazon for a third of what the salon wanted for it. Im in Love with this stuff....</li>
    <li> Having a fair skin complexion this did give me a nice glow and helped me to tan darker but if it is not rubbed in evenly orange streaking may occur.</li>
    <li> I have been alternating this lotion with 2 others while tanning. This lotion definitely brings out the color faster than other bronzers I am using. The smell is great... I don&#x27;t smell cooked after I tan! This lotion will stay in my rotation for a long time.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, dark tan. Smells eh though.</li>
