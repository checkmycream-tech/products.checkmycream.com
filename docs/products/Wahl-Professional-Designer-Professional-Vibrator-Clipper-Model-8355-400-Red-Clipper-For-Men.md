<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love it except it gets pretty hot in 15-20 min or so.</li>
    <li> These clippers certainly haven&#x27;t let me down.  I thought, hey, why not save some money and cut my own hair?  Did it for about 5 years straight, and the results were great.  These clippers have never let me down and were offered at a very reasonable price. I didn&#x27;t get too creative, mostly sticking to buzz cuts, but these clippers did a fantastic job for me.</li>
    <li> We bought our current Wahl Designer in 2002, just before we left for Alaska in an RV for 3 months. Our hairdresser gave us some tips on using it. Since then, my wife (no prior experience) has been giving me great haircuts. I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair so the #2 attachment works well. The Wahl is just starting to make a clattering noise and I couldn&#x27;t adjust it out with the side adjustment screw. It served us well for 13 years so we&#x27;re ordering another one just like it.</li>
    <li> I used to have a Conair and upgrade to this Wahl, what a difference.  Superior cutting which in comparison seems effortless.  Very nice razor!!!</li>
    <li> Real clippers baby!  Let the hair fly.  Theses are really nice.  Jump on while you can....sweet deal!  Shall I say more</li>
    <li> This product has great value with its 6 different lengths.  It works perfectly and seems very sturdy and reliable.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who likes to cut their own hair or have a friend do it at home.</li>
    <li> Great clippers, but I still suggest getting the wahl se&amp;ntilde;ors over this one</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Wahl professional clippers.  I cut my 3 boys&#x27; and my husband&#x27;s hair once a month.  I had gotten my last one from Sally Beauty Supply but they are more expensive than here on Amazon.  My last set lasted about 8 years.  So I ordered more.  There is no comparison to the cheap sets you find at Walmart, etc.  All I do is order new blades from Amazon every year or two and make sure I oil the clipper with every use.  I have only used this new one a couple times so far since receiving but so far so good.</li>
    <li> The first 3 uses of this clipper worked well.  Very easily to cut hair, cool to warm temperature of blade, looks good.  After literally the 5th to present number of uses, the problems so far:&lt;br /&gt;1.  The temperature of the blade becomes unbearably hot after about 15-20mins.  It gets worst in the summer when its humid.&lt;br /&gt;2.  The blade actually started to rust!  Had to wipe off the rust repeatedly to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took care of this thing very well:  oil blade before and after use, brush off hairs and cut hair only once a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:  The bad reviews on this thing is true.  I would not purchase this again or recommend anyone to buy this.</li>
    <li> Great clippers but was also best price around</li>
    <li> Works great! Bought as a replacement for an old set of cutters...very happy! Quality!</li>
    <li> I purchased this particular clipper over 8 years ago under the guidance of my hairdresser ( who taught me how to cut my husband &amp; two boys hair ) &amp; it has been an incredible money saving investment! It still is running flawlessly, I am preparing to buy another just to have on hand, if and when it dies. I believe the key to a long life is taking care of it, reading the instructions and cleaning it regularly. I oil it and use the turn key adjustment slot on the side (which is what makes it so noisy) to clean out the hair at least every 2-3 cuts.</li>
    <li> These are an excellent pair of clippers. I got these as a replacement for my old clippers that had begun to pull hair instead of actually cutting it. These new clippers are very sturdy and fell like they will last awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read other reviews that complained about the noise of the clippers and had some worry in that regard, but that proved to be unfounded. The clippers are no louder than any other pair of clippers I experienced from when I&#x27;ve had my hair cut in barber shops. The directions for first using the clippers include a step about adjusting a screw (turning it one way till the clippers make a loud noise, and then turning it 1/8 turn in the other direction). When making the adjustment, the clippers did indeed make that loud noise, and so I&#x27;m wondering if the other reviewers maybe haven&#x27;t made this screw adjustment yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pair of clippers was recommended to me by a friend who has used his clippers for over 2 years now and he has nothing but positive comments about it, as well.</li>
    <li> i DO NOT recommend these! they are so loud they leave ears ringing throughout my house! i cut my husband&#x27;s hair on a regular basis and got these when my old conair clippers started going out (hubby had taken them to the desert, go figure.) i&#x27;ve only used these a couple times because i can&#x27;t stand the noise. last time, i tried doing it on our balcony so as to not wake the baby and you could still hear it in every room of our place. it has an adjuster screw on the side to adjust the speed of the blades/quietness overall, but if you get it to a reasonable noise then it won&#x27;t cut hair - very slow and pinches all over. take my advice and stay away from them.</li>
    <li> Used these on my last deployment. Cut an entire shop&#x27;s hair for nine months. I&#x27;d buy&#x27;em again</li>
    <li> Twice as powerful and much faster than other clippers.  But does not come with combs 5 and 7.  Had to call Wahl for them.</li>
    <li> Just like the professional&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This clipper replaced an older Wahl set that I&#x27;d been using to cut my husband&#x27;s hair for 10 years. The old one still works, but sometimes it acts a little funny when turned on, so I bought this as a back-up. I like this set a lot better. The combs are just a tad bit wider, and there are more sizes included since the old set only had 1-4. I have cut my husband&#x27;s and my son&#x27;s hair with this set and I get great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I liked about the old set was that it came with a plastic storage case. This set does not. Not a huge deal, but the box that it comes in is not all that sturdy.</li>
    <li> I originally paid $75 for these clippers at the store.  After about 6 months they crapped out on me.  After talking to some stylists they told me that it was just a fluke and these are a great brand.  I purchased the new pair for $35 and they work just as good as my original pair.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about getting this as I have owned a no name model of similar construction in the past that didn&#x27;t cut well. I can say the Wahl 8355 Designer works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still using my rechargeable model for the beard and trimming, but for my hair, running the unit for extended periods, the Wahl is a better choice. It is strong and cuts clean. The attachment combs stay on firmly and provide good guidance. I had hoped it would come with a slanted comb for the ears, but it didn&#x27;t. As others have said, it runs cool and quiet as long as you read the manual and do the described power adjustment and maintenance.</li>
    <li> Truly fine clippers...a joy to use!</li>
    <li> I bought this so we could start saving $$ on haircuts for the men in my house. I&#x27;ve been happy with how it handles, and while my toddler gets a little tickled by it, it doesn&#x27;t scare him or hurt/pull hair. His daddy holds his face still (toddler tries to hold still, but he&#x27;s only 3) and I trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this on my husband&#x27;s hair, and it dose a great job. I&#x27;ve had it for about a year and hope to get many more happy years service out of it.</li>
    <li> I can buzz my own head cleanly and evenly in about 10 minutes.  These clippers mow through my thick hair like a hot knife through a stick of butter.  I just can&#x27;t imagine hair clippers being any better than this.  I shopped every clipper model including the very expensive Andis line, but I&#x27;m so glad I decided on this Wahl set.  Buy a bottle of Wahl clipper oil to go with these.  Your barber might resent you, but you&#x27;ll save a lot of money on haircuts.</li>
    <li> Not the best if you are looking to buzz your head with a #2 guard, misses many hairs on first sweep.  Not bad for the price though.</li>
    <li> The machine heats up. I thought it would take longer for the price. But within one hour it was hot. Is an ok machineok but can&#x27;t do many combinations for tapers.</li>
    <li> This is my second one (dropped the first one after many years of use).  Perfect haircuts for the family.  Quality product.  Electric clippers need to be oiled before and after every haircut. Yes, that is true.  Do it and this clipper will last forever....or until you drop it on the concrete floor.</li>
    <li> Love this clipper for many reasons, one it has a nice heavy feel for comfortable handling and cuts hair better than many clippers i have used before. Definitely worth investing in if your trying to save some money. Pays for itself after just a few cuts, why take the trip to the barbers when you can do it right from the comfort of your home.</li>
    <li> Two haircuts have already paid two thirds of the purchase price!!!&lt;br /&gt;My wife had never used a set of hair clippers before, she watched one video on U-Tube (Betty Ciao) and I ended up with a better haircut than I had been getting from a good local hairdresser!!&lt;br /&gt;The clipper is easy to use, just follow the very straight forward directions, it is well made and should last many years with the appropriate care.&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead and buy this product, you won&#x27;t be disappointed and you will be saving cash every time you use it!!!</li>
    <li> Great clippers. I have been a barber for I&#x27;ve 16 years and have used this in the past. After trying different clippers I always come back to the designer clippers. These clippers are just an all around great machine.</li>
    <li> we bought this to cut my hair.  according to other reviewers, wahl was the best so i went with them.  a little more expensive but glad i did.  this one was easy to use, quiet, and includes the guides and a small bottle of clipper oil and some other doodads.  we had never cut hair before and my friend was unenthusiastic about being blamed for poor results. (blame? me?) we watched a couple of youtubes to get the hang of it.  first time was easy and fun.  worked really well.  just as good as a hair shop.  did i mention free?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;yes you can do it!! very easy and quick. no appointment necessary.  you&#x27;ll wonder why you didn&#x27;t do this years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost a year later and no issues at all. After we got comfortable using it, we have tried other guides that come with it.  For us the cutter works best on dry hair with no product in it.  Easy to use with great results!</li>
    <li> I have had these clippers for a few years now. I barely used them for the first 2 years (about one a month or so). Now that I have a new job and my good clippers pooped the bed I am using the Wahl Designers. They leave long hairs behind, making my haircuts take longer because I have to go over the hair 5 or so times. I do 8-15 haircuts a shift. I feel these were good clippers before I had to use them so frequently, amaking them ideal for home use. They are on the cheap side and I would say worth the money if you would like to cut your hair at home once or twice a month. A professional looking for a clipper? This is not the one haha.</li>
    <li> This thing is solid. I bought it back in 2010 ant is still running strong. However, keep the oil handy because the blades WILL rust no matter what. I live in a place with high humidity in the air and the thing got rust after only 1 week i bough it. Watch out.</li>
    <li> I have only use designer professional for years.  It is normal to get hot after a  prolong use, it makes noise-you can adjust this.  But it does have a normal noise.  Bottom line:  Designer clip last a long time.  So I am going to purchase my third, not because my second is broken.  I need another one, so when I am cutting my dogs&#x27; hair I can switch to another hair clipper and continue.  When I use it on myself (yes, I cut my own hair), I only need 15 minutes and I am done. This brand is a great design.</li>
    <li> I truly love these clippers. I am a mother of two wild boys and a husband who rely on me for their haircuts. Our old set of clippers were wearing out so I thought why not these look like a good deal and have decent reviews. Well I&#x27;m glad I did. For the price they can&#x27;t be beat. They cut smooth and I don&#x27;t think they are loud at all. We have had them over a month and used them multiple times. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> excellent buy and excellent piece of equipment.</li>
    <li> This little clipper is WONDERFUL!!! Works amazingly well, won&#x27;t have to spend money on a new one every few months because I can really sharpen the blade! YAY!</li>
    <li> Product was making a terrible noise, after a while of not able to use, we checked and found out it came broken.</li>
    <li> These work real well and have all the standard attachments.  That said, the attachments have really sharp edges, so be careful with that.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t have a built in beard-trimmer style thing, which I&#x27;ve found helpful to bridge the gap between the #1 attachment and going attachment-less, so for those two reasons I&#x27;m going with a 4 out of 5.  Also, it&#x27;s powered by an electric motor that doesn&#x27;t get bogged down at all, but that motor heats well up if it&#x27;s running continuously for an extended time, so also be careful of burns.</li>
    <li> I got this clipper as a birthday gift for my boyfriend as his previous clipper was fading. It runs smoothly, has a good assortment of attachments, and &amp;#34;gets the job done quickly&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Marinello gives them out to there students. Very good and silent. adjustable head. Comes with its own clip on&#x27;s. nice.</li>
    <li> Just like the barbers use. Excellent quality!</li>
    <li> These are great clippers that are professional grade.  The cutting guides snap onto the blade to make cutting hair easy for even those with little or no experience cutting hair. We replaced a 20-year old Wahl clipper set with this set, as the old clippers were finally starting to get a bit dull.  This new set is every bit as good and really is a great value!  Just think of what you pay for a haircut - several haircuts equal the cost of this clipper set.</li>
    <li> This is a professional model clipper and it makes cutting hair so easy.  No tugging or pulling hair like the cheaper clippers.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is the same clipper my barber has been using for years.&lt;br /&gt;I got tired of traveling to the barber and waiting for him to get to me.&lt;br /&gt;After the first 2 haircuts this thing paid for itself.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have these clippers I can have a haircut anytime I want and I can maintain my hair the way it is instead of waiting for it to get messy to go to the barber. It comes with a tiny bottle of oil and instructions say to oil before and after use. I never saw my barber do that but I do it anyway. You might want to order a little oil too.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> Work good so far. Great price and Fast delivery too.</li>
    <li> Purchased for home use.  Had never used a clipper myself before this.  The unit was very easy to use and works really well.  Now I just need to get used to controlling the clipper while looking at my reflection in a triple mirror....LOL...</li>
    <li> the last one i had, lasted about 5yrs. im hoping for the same result out of this one, since the last one that was the same model lasted that long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned these clippers before so i already knew what to expect . i cut my hair pretty much every week and these definitely get the job done. for the price of these you get a good set of clippers! so overall if your looking for a decent pair of clippers that wont break your bank definitely check these out! BTW dont get those cheap walmart clippers! they break so easily!</li>
    <li> Works good, came two days early, and I got it at a great price</li>
    <li> Local retailer wanted $53 for this.  Amazon&#x27;s price beat it by far.  Cuts through my hair and my son&#x27;s thick wavy hair with ease.  No pulling or tugging and lots more power than the Wahl MC home model that it replaced.  AND all of the attachments from my old home model fit on this Pro level model.  I&#x27;ve only had it a couple of weeks so can&#x27;t speak about durability but my last Wahl lasted 12 years.  I&#x27;m very happy so far.</li>
    <li> Awesome clippers,,  they cut the hair really nice, I would cut my husband hair tell he&#x27;s last days he past away April 2013 ...&lt;br /&gt;affordable</li>
    <li> I called two barbers of my friends asking them about the best brand. Both recommended this product. I checked the price in the beauty store it was 59 dollars. I bought it from Amazon 38 only. I used it without adjusting the shaving degree for two weeks and them I reduced the degree and it is even better. I highly command this product. It is worth it.</li>
    <li> Definitely a step up from the basic unit bought at wal-mart and the like.  Very happy with it.  I use it for my beard too and have been very pleased at how well it works with the thicker hair</li>
    <li> These clippers are terrible. They got hot enough to burn my hands when I cut my son&#x27;s hair, the first haircut out of the box.</li>
    <li> Rather a of of vibration - especially to the recipient of the hair cut. Does cut well and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> They are great clippers, everything is good! Fading is well also. The only reason i went 4 stars is because its a little loud but over all they are great clippers.</li>
    <li> They sent the designer clipper but it was an older model, not the one shown in the listing. And the older model I got does not have the eyebrow attachment.</li>
    <li> I bought my wahl designer about a year ago and im going to replace them soon. These are great for a student learning about fades but if you are already in a salon doing many haircuts, these won&#x27;t last. My co-worker had the same clippers,purchased it  recently, had to replace them due to bad alignment and noise (the same problem I&#x27;m having),Yes we did oil them before and after haircuts and took good care of them. I suggest to look for other types of wahl.</li>
    <li> Works great! Cuts like its supposed to, not disappointed! :)</li>
    <li> I just had my first haircut with this particular model.  At first, the clippers sounded like a well tuned strong running engine.  After three minutes they lost power and seemed to be chewing pieces. I have tried different Wahl models and found the chrome corded model with the smaller battery trimmer was and is the most reliable and consistent model.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one!</li>
    <li> These shears are great quality, they cut very smoothly&lt;br /&gt;and easily. I totally recommend them to any looking to&lt;br /&gt;do their own hair at home. Great price for a professional&lt;br /&gt;product.</li>
    <li> Great hair clippers for the in home amateur, do it yourself &#x27;er.  Compared to my old Walmart cheapo set I had, this thing is the real deal.  Nice product and looking forward to years of use.</li>
    <li> This unit replaces an identical unit we have been using for years. Cuts very good. Will save old unit for clipping the dog.</li>
    <li> The one key feature with this rechargeable shaver is you can still operate it while it is charging. No downtime.</li>
    <li> Just got this product today, and I immediately performed a haircut on myself, and what more can I say about this great clipper by Wahl. Instructions are short and compact and the grooming kit is included (pretty much every guards you&#x27;ll need, including eyebrow trimming guard and oil for the blade). It does it&#x27;s job perfectly!</li>
    <li> Just used the hair clippers ordered and found them to be exactly as advertised. Comparing these clippers to the clippers I had been using previously the job was completed quickly &amp; easily.  The price was an incredible $18 less than I could purchase them locally. Recommend them for anyone doing home hair cutting.</li>
    <li> They were EXTREMELY noisy, had to keep adjusting the power screw after every haircut. Then the blades stopped moving after 4 months. Its not even worth the effort of trying to send back. I&#x27;ve had cheaper Wahls that lasted longer than this and weren&#x27;t as noisy. I think I&#x27;m through with Wahl clippers. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> the best clippers I&#x27;ve owned. I have been cutting my hair for 15 yrs. I have thick black hair and these clippers do not freeze up when cutting. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Best clippers I&#x27;ve used by far.</li>
    <li> Had this for almost a year now and its held up great. I buzz my head every week with it with no guard and run it under water and alcohol once in awhile. No rust and runs great. I just wish it got a bit closer, it leaves about 1/8 inch of hair.</li>
    <li> I use *this for cutting my mentally disabled son&#x27;s hair.  He hates to get his hair cut, but with this clipper I&#x27;m able to do it so fast and it comes out really short and even.  Easy to clean and does a great job....looks like a barber cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I do use the Wahl Peanut trimmer also for trimming around his ears, as this clipper is too large to do a good job around that area of his head.</li>
    <li> Have used once and am happy with performance to this point. It is a bit heavy and the \\&quot;vibrator\\&quot; part takes some getting used to but it does a good job of trimming. Provided attachments also work well.&lt;br /&gt;Good value for the money.</li>
    <li> This feels much more solidly built than the previous $20 ones I&#x27;ve bought from the department stores. Does an excellent job cutting my hair (I&#x27;m black.) The fully variable cut height is useful. It buzzes a little and the blades can get quite warm, but I&#x27;d buy another one. Recommended.</li>
    <li> very effective, while price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd set of Wahl Clippers I have owned but my first set of Professional Wahl Clippers. Each set has lasted me quite a long time. The last set lasted about 4 years before it started making a super loud buzzing noise. I cut my hair with these yesterday and they just seemed to cut a lot better than my old set did. It might be because the old set was four years old and the blades were getting dull but what I can tell you is that my first impression is that these are a great set of clippers!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my friend&#x27;s Wahl hair clipper for a long time now, so I decided to buy my own. I already knew (by using my friend&#x27;s all the time) that this brand is good.</li>
    <li> They are doing great. I typically have my ladyfriends cut my hair and they are never professionals and take a long time. These clippers do get fairly warm eventually, but never too hot (my cellphone and computer both get hotter when under load). It seems well made and is easy to operate. My favorite part is that they are quiet. I have sensitive hearing and am easily upset by loud environments, and these have yet to trigger my aural disdain.</li>
    <li> Nice clipper, no problems with it</li>
    <li> I read some comments about how loud these clippers are but I don&#x27;t think they are very loud.  I had two sets of clippers (one was an old Wahl set that I had for well over ten years) and this replaced them both.  Well worth it.</li>
    <li> I cut my hair once a week with these. They never pull my hair. I get a smooth clean cut every time.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended Wahl clippers when I asked about clippers for cutting my husband&#x27;s hair. This product works very well and cuts in one pass. Saves me time, although my husband&#x27;s hair is a buzz cut and doesn&#x27;t usually take a lot of time. The old clippers (a drugstore brand) would take several passes to get the same effect. The Wahl clippers are definitely several notches above the drugstore brand. My husband also studied the choices available and is very happy with this selection and price on Amazon. I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The clippers cut very evenly, and I have absolutely no complaints so far. I&#x27;ve owned them for about a month and already have recouped my $$. It is a bit heavy, but I assume a quality product should have a bit of weight to it.</li>
    <li> Broke even on the cost of going to the barber the second time I used it.  As good as the ones the barbers were using.  I don&#x27;t use the snap on level adjustments but tried them and they work great.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  I have been using this for over six months to cut my children&#x27;s hair.  Works great.</li>
    <li> Amazing product and seller!!!, no defects, fast shipping, great quality, could not be happier!</li>
    <li> Amazing clippers! They blend perfect I love them</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had about 10 haircuts with this clipper, it&#x27;s much better than the cheap one we had that kept jamming. Keep it oiled and it should last a long time.  It cuts through thick hair decently.  The vibration gets bothersome when used around the ears, but isn&#x27;t too bad.  I&#x27;d buy Wahl&#x27;s again, the quality is good and the price is decent.</li>
    <li> I had never cut my own hair before but when I got tired of paying $16 every  3 weeks and seeing what everyone else&#x27;s hair cut looked like, I thought I could cut my own..I read the reviews and decided on this Wahl..I love this clipper. Even my biggest critic, my wife, says My self haircuts are better than the $16 kind.I don&#x27;t miss the traffic, the cost of gasoline to get there, the wait, the barbers stories or the waste of time every three weeks..I&#x27;ve cut my own hair twice now and I m getting pretty good at it..You can too..This Wall 8355 Vibrator clipper is the best thing since sliced bread..</li>
    <li> These are my reserve. My first clipper of this kind from 2011 is still working just as if I bought it today.</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper for my son for Christmas because I had bought my other son a Wahl Designer Clipper about 15 years ago and it is still performing like new.</li>
    <li> I bought this to clip my three-year old&#x27;s hair after seeing it in the kid&#x27;s salon.  It is super quiet, and I saved $25 by clipping his hair myself.</li>
    <li> Love these clippers. Have owned 3 Remingtons, will never go back. They feel solid, they cut evenly, glide smoothly across my scalp, and don&#x27;t catch on my skin like some others have. My parents owned a wahl growing up, now I know why it lasted so long. These are build to last.</li>
    <li> This is my second Wahl Designer clipper.  The first was great, lasting 5 years, it just got dropped.  Went with this again...you can&#x27;t beat the quality for the price.</li>
    <li> I am a hairdresser and have used wahl clippers for almost thirty years. The clipper I was using was almost that old before I had to replace it with this one. Works just as wonderfully as the previous one...sturdy enough for years of use!</li>
    <li> Well made, easy to use, good price. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I asked a professional hair stylist what clippers I should get and these are what I was told would be the best. For the price the quality is very good I use these weekly for my own personal use and I am very happy with how these perform they feel very well built when in hand they were definitely a good investment</li>
    <li> Cuts great but is a bit heavy. Understanding that Professional clippers are made of better quality, the weight is worth the extra effort.</li>
    <li> Im in beauty school and use these every day I had the chi clippers that came with my kit but all of us have replaced them with these</li>
    <li> Really professional grade clipper.  Rock solid. they never clog.  They cut real well.  I highly recommend them.  They seem like they will last for many years.</li>
    <li> Nice clipper, my dog got my old one yea.</li>
    <li> I ordered these clippers after looking at many sets. They haven&#x27;t disappointed me at all. We have a long haired small dog and they cut her hair very well. The clippers are quiet and the hair doesn&#x27;t jam them up. I&#x27;m sure our dog appreciates them also as its 103 degrees out today.</li>
    <li> Good clippers. Blade can be adjusted. Doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
    <li> These are the best clippers I&#x27;ve owned so far. As a stylist, I&#x27;ve tried many different clippers. Most clippers advertise they can cut through wet hair, long hair, and dry hair. In my experience, The Wahl Designer does exactly like they&#x27;ve advertised. They cut through hair wet or dry hair like butter. When I was using the Oster Free Riders they kept getting stuck in my clients hair and pulling it. Not to mention, they did a terrible job of cutting through wet hair and longer hair. Of course, this caused my clients much discomfort. Needless to say, I lost a few clients due to not having the right equipment. Live and learn. Use Wahl.</li>
    <li> Just got my new Wahl Designer clippers. Just a note, when you open the box the blade combs and oil may be underneath the plastic insert so don&#x27;t think they were left out of the box like I did.  They worked great on my hair and gave an even cut. I don&#x27;t think they vibrate that much like some other review mentioned. If you want to cut your own hair give these a try. Great price for a good set of clippers.</li>
    <li> those clippers were for my daughter,she loves them thank you.</li>
    <li> A well made clipper that is going to last me a long time. Cuts hair like a charm, doesn&#x27;t miss anything. Cheap clippers will hestiate/stall and pull my hair because i have such thick hair, but not a problem with theses clippers. Bottom line, I recommend them to anyone who wants a quality clipper.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. worth every penny. This clipper has paid for it self several times over. Wahl does it again.</li>
    <li> Nice pair of clippers!!! I bought the same pair from sally&#x27;s beauty supply previously and they lasted me over a year. I work in a very busy shop, most of the time they done last 6 months.</li>
    <li> I have tried and sent back a few of these types. This one, so far seems really good. the cord is nice and thick and seems very professional.</li>
    <li> Clippers are ok ,they get hot if used for long period of time. They do a nice mens taper cut</li>
    <li> This product has met my expectations.  It works as advertised which can be a rarity in this day and age of declining commitment to quality products and service!</li>
    <li> If you fear this newer model may not be up to the standard of the traditional very heavy duty Wahl units, fear not. It does the job in the same highly professional fashion, with the same strong motor and sharp blades that have been the earmark of Wahl. Just a little shinier and prettier than the old ones! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have had the clippers for only a few weeks and the head is starting to rust. I have used Wahl for  30 years never had that happen before.</li>
    <li> so happy, super sharp tho!  watch your sensitive parts!  a bit loud, but perfect opperation!  just what we needed, thanks!</li>
    <li> Saw these in sally&#x27;s the other day for much more than on here.  Much quieter than I expected, but we were using really old walmart ones. They work very well for our at home haircuts.</li>
    <li> I looked, I found, and I am happy. This clipper replaces another brand, that finally gave out after 50 years. I&#x27;m certain it will outlive me as I am 77 years old. Thanks</li>
    <li> Cut really good fade well i cut my own hair and i do diffrent look all the time i like them lot</li>
    <li> Too loud and ineffective and did not work well on curly hair. I would not recommend it, it gets 2 stars because it looks good lol</li>
    <li> Cuts quickly. The combs snap more precise than another Wahl I bought. Keeps cool even when I cut three back-to-back.</li>
    <li> I love this clipper.It will pay for itself the first or second time you use it.It works excellent.</li>
    <li> I owned this buzzer for around 7 years, using it weekly to shave my head and my beard. I treated this buzzer like crap, I never oiled it and occasionally left it wet after cleaning it. By the end of my 5th or 6th year owning it started to rust a little (my fault only) but it still worked great. Eventually, I dropped it on the floor and the razor edge fell off and I couldn&#x27;t find all the same pieces, so I decided to buy another one. This doesn&#x27;t have a ton of bells or whistles but the quality is there and its worth it, especially if you use it weekly or monthly -  Every time I shave my head I think about the 10-20 dollars I just saved, so you make your money back very quickly!</li>
    <li> Great for salons or personal use.</li>
    <li> Very good jus had to set the adjustment level</li>
    <li> Cuts through hair like nothing</li>
    <li> Pretty good clipper for the $</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my family&#x27;s hair for nearly 20 years now and this has to be the best purchase we&#x27;ve ever made for clippers.  The clippers provide a nice smooth cut with virtually little noise. It came with an assortment of guides, a sturdy comb, oil with brush, and an easy-to-use black storage bag. It&#x27;s wonderful for doing an all over cut and for just trimming up the hair line. What I use to cut by hand, is now a breeze to do with these clippers... It&#x27;s light weight and the cord has plenty of length to manuever around my family. I would definitely recommend this clipper as it&#x27;s easy to care for and easy to use! [[ASIN:B000EDNCJO Wahl Professional 8355 Designer Professional Vibrator Clipper]]</li>
    <li> I ventured into cutting my own hair and did some research on which clippers to buy. I settled on these one and I’m happy with my purchase. My first hair cut was quite the experience though. I cut my hair using the #1 guard; then took the guards off and left the bathroom. I came back to the bathroom and picked up the clippers and started cutting (without the guard on). I immediately realized the mistake but it was too late, so I just finished my hair with the guards off. I’ve cut my hair about 3 or 4 times so far…I’ll keep doing it unless my wife schedules us for family pictures, I have a wedding or some other formal event; I’ll head back to the barber for a quick cut</li>
    <li> Works great on beard maintenance and this machine is well built. So glad I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Wahl is still made in America and making a quality product.  Really love Amazon.com, got the clippers on black friday.</li>
    <li> Only used once, but I can tell this is a quality product as well as powerful and useful.  It&#x27;s not too big, but it is slightly heavy which isn&#x27;t a problem especially when consider it&#x27;s heavy because its made with quality parts like more metal instead of cheap plastic.  They blade really does adjust depth with the gizmo on the side.  My previous clippers had the adjustment but it was silly and didn&#x27;t function.  It vibrates and is very strong in the cutting arena.  I have thick hair that would bog down all the clippers I&#x27;ve ever tried from Walmart and Target but not this Wahl... finally what appears to be the last clippers I&#x27;ll have to get mad at.  I&#x27;ll only know for sure after a year of using, but I&#x27;m certain this is going to pass the test.  It didn&#x27;t come with the two attachments I had from a previous Wahl that my wife uses on the cats - the two clipper attachments I&#x27;m referring to are the ones for going around the ears.  Totally not a reason to purchase a different clipper.  I&#x27;m only saying don&#x27;t throw your old ones out yet, they might fit this Wahl.  I just had to cut the tangs a little bit on the old ones, took 3 minutes.  Oh, it says it was made in America which mattered to me.</li>
    <li> I really like the Wahl brand. My last set of clippers lasted 10 yrs and I hope this one will do the same. Amazon is great..</li>
    <li> Arrived on time,  brand new,  they work great and cheaper than in store prices</li>
    <li> I bought my old clipper 15 years ago at Walmart.  A the end of its life span, I was making 50 passes over my head and it still missed bits.  The Wahl Pro Designer, brand new, didn&#x27;t miss anything, it mowed my head!</li>
    <li> AFTER USING SO MANY YEARS CLIPPERS FROM RITE AID AND OTHER BIG STORES I AM DECIDE GET PRO CLIPPER.&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S LIKE NITE AND DAY.I LOVE IT.THIS IS PRO TOOL WITH GOOD PRICE FOR HOME USE. I AM SO HAPPY I GO WITH THIS MODEL. I GET NICE AND CLEAN PRO CUTS .HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
