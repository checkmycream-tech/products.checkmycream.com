    <li> Seems like it would be a great product but just a lil too dark but I put a lil face powder over it to even out color. Wish they would include a brush or applicator with product though.</li>
    <li> I love this product it awesome but the way they have it set up on the site made me think I was getting 3 different colors instead of one.</li>
    <li> This is terrific. It does not irritate. It is translucent and sets your foundation. I was professionally photographed and my skin looked flawless with no shade variations.</li>
