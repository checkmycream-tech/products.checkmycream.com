    <li> This is the best body wash I ever used. It&#x27;s quite refreshing! It smells really good and moisturizes the body well. I have been using this product for many years, and I also recommended it to many family members and friends. I truly enjoy the aroma of this product. My favorite is the lavender and chamomile.

    <li> I could appreciate the generous size.  Beautifully scented.  It lathered nicely.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> smells wonderful and is very calming</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price. But it smells NOTHING like lavender. If you look at the ingredient list, lavender is not even listed.</li>
    <li> This smells heavenly for my a.m. shower, as well as post-workout. So relaxing and refreshing. Even my cat loves it! She stands up and leans on me after I use it:)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this was lavender with patchouli and citrus.. It&#x27;s very soapy smelling and seems to hydrate well, but I was just looking for a sweeter smelling body wash. I would like to see some ridges or texture to the bottle.. it is very heavy when full and as slippery as a fish. It is not easy to hold a pouf in one hand and pour the product on with the other</li>
    <li> Nice, relaxing fragrance.</li>
    <li> This one really is over the top for calming effect.  Take more baths than I should because I&#x27;m addicted to the scent!</li>
    <li> I love lavender and I bought this to go with a natural lavender shampoo.  My favorite way to use it is in bath water.  So very relaxing!  No regrets here.</li>
    <li> Smells delicious  and makes my skin very soft. Reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this body wash.  They used to sell it at the Exchange but they stopped and I have been looking for it.  I should have know I could find it on Amazon, they have everything!!!</li>
    <li> Nothing natural about this product!  Tons of un-natural ingredients.  I ended up giving it away as it made me itchy!</li>
    <li> My wife loves Village Naturals Bath Wash. She stays in the tub for hrs. (just kidding) She likes the suds and says it&#x27;s not as drying like so many others. And she smells great after.</li>
    <li> I adore this body wash, the aroma and the feel it leaves on my skin is amazing, I simply love it.</li>
    <li> My favorite bath and body wash. Very thick and creamy and makes a lot of suds. A nice companion to the other Village Naturals bath products that come in the same scent.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot, but wish it had a stronger smell.</li>
    <li> I like how it moisturizes; just wish the lavender fragrance was a tad stronger.</li>
