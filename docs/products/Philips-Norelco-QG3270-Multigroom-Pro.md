<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;d been using this trimmer for the last 4 years and fully satisfied with its performance and working. I would recommend this to everyone. It has great battery-backup.</li>
    <li> Originally ordered as a tool for cutting hair.  It comes with a selection of clippers that allow for a complete tool to create a professional-looking cut.  No nicks.  No scrapes.  A nice even cut.  The product is actually a lot easier to use (great design) and a lot more useful than I had expected.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It serves as a beard trimmer as well as a hair groomer for me. The attachments were a bit hard to connect/disconnect initially but later on they fit perfectly with a click. The battery life is a good 60-90min.</li>
    <li> I use the adjustable trimmer for my mustache and beard. The plastic slide adjustment isn&#x27;t very sturdy and can change the adjustment setting by just gripping the groomer. I found myself starting on setting #8 and when I was finished I found the slide adjustment down to #4.  Not very happy with this product. I liked my old Norelco T-900 much better.</li>
    <li> Worked great and as expected for 5 months then died and now is worthless...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t recommend it although Philips are intending to send me a replacement under warranty...</li>
    <li> The Norelco groomer has all the attachments and quality that I was looking for in a product in this price range.  The battery life is great and the unit feels well made.  No issues whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Very nice tool for both beard trimming and buzz cutting of hair with selectable length up to about 3/4\\&quot;.  I liked it better than my corded Wahl hair trimmer.</li>
    <li> have had it for a time now and it works great. very light and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it had some more close trim settings.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend who had a similar style.  I went off the ratings from the other Men &amp; my Man likes this!  You cant go wrong Ladies, it has all the attachements they need for their look.</li>
    <li> This is a great little trimmer for quick, \\&quot;light\\&quot; jobs. It seems well built for the price with a good design that makes it easy to handle. I&#x27;ve had no issues with it trimming my hair. It also uses a lithium ion battery which is a plus (lighter weight and more power). Should anything change then I will update this review.</li>
    <li> I used it once to shave my head and another time to trim my beard and then the battery died. It won&#x27;t charge or even work while it&#x27;s plugged in. shell out a little more money and get a more reliable product. Only had this item for 5 weeks and they wont take it back. DON&#x27;T WAIST YOUR MONEY !!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Sideburns, beards, and quick trims to your neckline are a breeze, but I feel the width of the trimmer is too narrow to fully cut your own hair.  I&#x27;ve been using trimmers to cut my hair myself for years, but it would take me too long with this one.</li>
    <li> **Thoughts on this product below are written by my Husband. **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous to the Norelco, I had a plug-in ConAir clippers. They cut my hair fine, but the cord was a bit of a bother. I&#x27;d normally have to use an extension cord to be able to use it where I would make the least amount of mess. The case it all came in wasn&#x27;t all that huge, but it contained a myriad of attachments and finding the right one was a bother. Cleaning the inside of the clippers was a real chore and took  far longer than it should. You had to remove the blades to do it. Enter the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing I noticed was the size. It&#x27;s much more compact than my previous clippers. It plugs in to charge, so when I used it, I didn&#x27;t have to worry about the cable limiting me or getting in my way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also only a total of 6 attachments, and all are small. There are two sized (width) of clippers, and one adjustable sizing attachment for each. No more digging around for that #2. The clippers and guides work together in harmony, with a pair of designators on the clippers that align with the guides so it&#x27;s very easy to see what setting it is on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers are also super easy to clean. You just take them off and can blow them out and use the included brush to remove the hair waste material. The brush has two different sides that reach and clean all the various bits you might want to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s also a nose hair clipper attachment, and a mini shaver. I suggest keeping the latter on when you store the Norelco and attachments in the handy bag. If somehow the clipper gets turned on, it&#x27;s least likely to cause any damage. You should keep at least one attachment on to keep the Norelco clean and to keep the moving part grease on the moving parts from getting all over stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco is a dream. There&#x27;s less bits to mess around with, and the bits there are all work fantastically. I cut my hair and beard in no time with none of the fuss of my previous clippers. I adore it.</li>
    <li> This little tool works even better than I&#x27;d hoped.&lt;br /&gt;First, it has various specialized \\&quot;heads\\&quot; or attachments for everything from hair cutting, beard or mustache trimming, and even a nose and ear hair attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially appreciated is a micro electric shaving attachment for those hard to reach spots that usually produce razor burn from trying to shave around the nose or chin with a regular size razor or \\&quot;Good News\\&quot; type razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments all can be changed and cleaned quickly and easily, and the batteries charge easily and hold the charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> This is a good product for the price.  The attachments work well and are easily cleaned.  My beard and mustache have rarely looked so good.</li>
    <li> This is a fine product at a great price. It comes with a variety of implements that should meet all the major grooming and touch-up tasks one will need. It comes with a carrying case/bag that&#x27;s about the same size as, say, an overnight kit, and all the accessories fit nicely into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve really only used this to trim my beard, and it&#x27;s worked perfectly. It&#x27;s not a shaver, exactly, but the closest blade setting does a terrific job of cutting the hair close enough that I haven&#x27;t needed to shave with a razor since getting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It charges quickly and holds its charge well- the last recharge saw me through four weeks of bi-weekly use. Cleanup is simple, and its design limits &#x27;trapped hairs&#x27; in the mechanisms, so there isn&#x27;t any &#x27;buildup&#x27; of hair over the course of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In brief, it&#x27;s solid, well-made, and it performs well. The variety of grooming tasks it can perform make it a great value.</li>
    <li> Form:    The body sports a slim black body with a silver reflecting surface mounted on the side where the on-button is located.  On the bottom side of the body is the push-button that can be depressed to release the various adapter heads.  Practically every trimming task one would pursue, from carving out a goatee to boring out unsightly nose hairs, are all provisioned by the easily removable adapter heads.  For a buzz cut, the kit also includes two different offset adapters, allowing one to make buzz cuts ranging from the thick and burly to the thin pixie.  A corded A/C adapter slides easily into the bottom of the shaver to provide a full overnight charge towards your next morning grooming session.    Function:    The in-line shavers made clean cuts on the sideburns while the nose hair trimmer was surely felt doing its job when inserted.  One would be well advised to not use the nose hair trimmer adapter as one would a plumbing snake, for the blades are a bit exposed.  Cleaning up the job was easy since the adapters are light and are cleaned off well by merely rinsing with hot water.  The black drawstring baggie that it comes with is water-resistant and gives a snug fit to the shaver and its accessories.    Overall:    A multi-functional trimmer in a compact, easy to use package.  The price is about right.</li>
    <li> This first caught my eye because it was cheap and had good reviews. And after having it for a while, I love this thing. It does everything you need it to do, some more efficient than others. For example, the mini foil shaver is extremely small so it&#x27;s going to take forever and a day to get that bare skin look. It&#x27;s best to use another razor if that&#x27;s the look you are going for. I don&#x27;t let my beard grow out too long and I don&#x27;t use it to cut my hair. So for what I use it for, it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Norelco made thee best groomer years back. Sadly; they no longer make that line of groomers.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands but I have found them to be much worse so I will only use a Norelco. I bought a similar unit with the built in vacuum. The vacuum works well actually, other manufactures similar products the vacuum failed to work well. However, it was missing the built in detail razor due to having the vacuum it just isn&#x27;t possible due to the design to have both the detail trimmer and the vacuum feature. I find that trimming my mustache with the vacuum model cumbersome. When I saw this new model, I bought it instantly! I love all the attachments, it&#x27;s light and thinner than previous models. It has a cool chrome look to it. Swapping attachments is simple and the lithium battery is a vast improvement over Ni-cad. It&#x27;s messy without the vacuum but it gets everywhere that I need hair trimmed unlike models with the built in vacuum. Even with a vacuum model you still have some mess. Steer clear of the gimmicky vacuum models this is the one! I have 2 complaints. The attachment bag is a joke. I for one would pay more for a proper accessory and or carry case. The second is the sliding hair guide, I just can&#x27;t see the numbers. Can you please bring back the model that actually cuts hair well. Wishful thinking. They constantly change models to make money unfortunately the so called improvements rarely work. In this case, I like this razor it&#x27;s as close as I can get to the model that worked and is no longer make.  UPDATE: I mentioned that I liked this trimmer so far. Well It has been a few months and I love it! Good luck with yours and I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoy mine.  Update:4 years old still works like new! update, 5 years! If it ever dies you can bet I&#x27;ll buy Phillips/Norelco!</li>
    <li> I ordered the product on Saturday, and it arrived on Tuesday.  Charged it for the requisite time in the manual, and used it Tuesday night.  I will compare this to the Philips Norelco model G390 that this one replaces (not only did Norelco retire it, but so did I!).  What allowed me to purchase this one instead of the other lesser model that Norelco has out is the one-hour charge time and 50-minute usage; much improved over a 10-hour charge and being lucky if it ran for a half-hour.  Mind also, I&#x27;ve been using Norelco electric products since my mid-teens and have experienced some good shavers and trimmers, and some bad ones.  This one ranks among the top of my list.  1) The machine itself is tremendously powerful compared to the G390.  I&#x27;m not complaining about the latter, but it&#x27;s nice to not have to run over my head, face, and neck several times with the new one.  Even the buzzing is louder, and the vibration and unit itself are heavier when held.  It&#x27;s a personal preference, but I like that, and it correlates with the unit&#x27;s strength. 2) The attachments are basically the same, with the exception of the addition of a wider form of the beard trimmer, which is supposed to be used when clipping head hair, not facial hair. 3) Hence, the hair trimmer has its own plastic bladed attachment, as does the beard trimmer (the G390 allowed you to put either plastic piece over the trimmer).  The only concern I had was that the numbers which label the plastic pieces are done as every-other-number intervals, so the plastic pieces have to be slid into place with a little extra caution. 4) Getting the attachments on and off of the unit is easy with the press of a button.  Getting the plastic covers off of the trimmers is a little trickier and takes some getting used to. 5) Although I wasn&#x27;t supposed to wash the G390 attachments under water, I did anyway.  This unit expressly states that you should!  Inspecting the unit and attachments more closely, I can easily see that the new items are better sealed in general so that water would penetrate with a lot of difficulty -if at all. 6) Instead of a plastic molded stand in which one would drop the unit and attachments, this new model comes with a drawstring bag.  Much nicer and collapsable; can be stored more easily or stacked, instead of having a separate space to accomodate the stand. 7) Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but the new attachments didn&#x27;t leave behind marks after going over some surfaces on my scalp and neck a few times at different angles without the need for pressing it heavily against my skin (that&#x27;s an illusion: a person thinks they&#x27;re getting the hair off better when they&#x27;re really not; it&#x27;s a reaction to a poorly-cutting machine!).  I got used to having red marks for about a day once I was done trimming everything roughly each week or two, but this left behind a clean, smooth surface which was delicate but not irritated.  My skin happens to be a bit sensitive, I suppose, but this was a relief. 8) True to form, I spent a half-hour shaving/trimming/grooming for the first time ever, and the unit still has plenty of power. 9) The new unit has a light which tells you when it&#x27;s low on power and when it&#x27;s done recharging.  The other one had nothing which did this! 10) The plastic pieces themselves seem sturdier than the ones that came with the last model, where the blades broke off and left some very sharp edges (one of which sliced my neck while shaving two weeks ago because I hadn&#x27;t known it broke mid-trim!). 11) The charger itself is not boxy at all, but (as another reviewer correctly stated) fits into any 110v socket without blocking its twin -if there are the usual two.  This is extremely convenient, since I can now plug it in next to things without worrying which one takes priority for soaking up a little electricity!  That&#x27;s about all I can think of.  I&#x27;m confident this one will last a long time.  UPDATE 8/29/11: I&#x27;ve now been using this for weeks.  So far, so good.  The plastic attachments which cover two of the trimmers require a little extra effort to slide them on and off without removing the trimmers themselves, but no biggie.  Also, all of the attachments which fit into the main unit seem to require very little effort to remove... perhaps the catch is too loose?  Also not a deal-breaker because they stay on when they need to.  This is one powerful unit, I must say, and I&#x27;ve only had to recharge it once (impressive, considering I use this thing at least 2-3x/week for various purposes but mostly for maintaining my a goatee and my head&#x27;s fuzziness).  Through some experimentation, I&#x27;ve found the right lengths to go with.  Best of all, none of the blades -no matter how close they shave/trim and no matter how hard I accidentally push a given attachment onto my face or scalp- have left my rather sensitive skin with any irritation.  I maintain my stance that this will probably go for the long haul.  UPDATE, 1/9/2013: Still going strong.  UPDATE, 4/20/2016: Still going strong. Unbelievable!</li>
    <li> best trimmer i&#x27;ve ever owned. long battery life and lasted overall about 3 years until i dropped it and broke. now it&#x27;s an old, discontinued model and sells online for 150. as much as i loved it, it&#x27;s not worth double the price that it originally retailed for 3-4 years ago.  but it IS a great trimmer</li>
    <li> The product is very slim and got all the accessories you need, needless to say getting it for $22 is AWESOME!</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for my old Philips Norelco which had served me well for 3/4yrs. The teeth started breaking of the attachments, and needing charging more often.  This new model is a winner.Its a little different but plenty of power, quick recharge. Just wish it had a stand to put all your bits in rather than the bag. But pleased i stuck with Philips and pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I maintain a bald head with a stubble beard. I&#x27;ve shaved utilizing a razor, trimmer, and a beard trimmer in the past. My andis trimmer died on me after 10+ years. My remmington beard trimmer died on me after 3 months. So I decided to try a multigroomer to replace both.  Pros:  The multigroomer does ok with everything.   I really like it for shaping up my beard.  It keep the beard looking neat.  Cons:  The trimmer does not shave close enough for by head or my neck.  The beard trimmer does not get close enough to give me the stubble look.  You have to press hard for the beard trimmer to try to get the subble look.  Overall, I think I&#x27;ll keep it but I&#x27;ll be buying another andis trimmer.</li>
    <li> This is a great grooming tool.  All the pros you&#x27;ve read in the other reviews are all true.  It cuts very well, is clearly a high quality product that runs smoothly.  But there was one fatal flaw which kills this product for me.  When you attach one of the clipper attachments, you can adjust the cutting length by depressing on the back of the attachment with your thumb and sliding it up or down.  The problem is that this spot is too conveniently placed. It happens to be where the thumb naturally rests(at least my thumb). On more than one occasion, I was trimming my beard in the mirror when all of a sudden I noticed it was nearly cut off completely!  Why? Becasue the adjuster slid to the lowest stetting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could be that the adjuster&#x27;s locking mechanism is looser on mine than others but this is definitely a fatal flaw.  I have to be very careful when I shave and it really annoys me.  Especially since it sometimes falls to the lowest setting even while being careful.  Otherwise this would have gotten 5 stars from me.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t skimp for those trimmers that may be $10 cheaper.  Spend the extra money and get something that works well instead of just working.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a beard trimmer for travel because it seemed light weight and compact. It is very compact and light weight.  However, it is one of the best beard trimmers I have used.  I have been using it for about 1 month now and am very satisfied with its performance.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son as a christmas present, based on his choice (reading the reviews). He really liked it for the few months it worked, but then it stopped charging. It was outside of the timeframe to return it, so alas, into the garbage it goes....</li>
    <li> This is a high quality multi-groomer. With many heads to choose from it is a versatile tool. The build quality is excellent and the performance is very good.  Its lightweight and the groomer and attachments are easily stowable in the bag that comes with it.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco Multigroom Pro is a nice razor. It&#x27;s light, fits easily into your hand, and is easy to use. I have facial hair and I have a child and we both need frequent grooming. Having a versatile razor is a plus, especially one that is so easy to bring along on vacations or extended trips. Especially useful is the lithium-ion battery that charges in one hour and provides 50 minutes of power. In my experience, that&#x27;s more than enough juice to get the job done. You can also just plug it in and use it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor also comes with an assortment of attachments, which is what provides it the flexibility I was looking for. My previous razor lacked these and I can&#x27;t use it for much more than my face. I would never attempt to cut my son&#x27;s hair with it. If I were to be away for an extended period of time I&#x27;d have had to pack the hair trimmer and a razor; now I can leave home with just the one item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beard and mustache brush did a nice job on my face. I always worry about too close a cut but I started out at the highest setting and worked my way down toward the shortest until I got it to where I wanted it. It was a clean, comfortable shave and my beard and mustache looked great when I was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a mini shaver and detail trimmer that you can use to finish edges and create precise lines, and I tried this as well and was more than satisfied with its performance. As an added bonus it comes with a nose, ear, and eyebrow hair trimmer, something many people of either sex will be able to make use of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanup is always a concern but I had no problems cleaning up the Multigroom Pro. The attachments are washable and the brush  took care of stray hairs easily enough. It comes with a pouch that holds the razor and attachments, making it eaysy to tuck away into luggage without worrying about having all the pieces with you.</li>
    <li> Comment made was the product was far superior in trimming his beard than his current trimmer. He will also use it to trim his hair but has not used it for that purpose yet but expects the same quality response.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer.  It is easy to use and keeps a charge for quite a while.  I was getting haircuts to keep my hair short, but this trimmer does that job.  There are many accessories.  There is an easy to use scale on the groomer.  This trimmer will save me money.  It does a great job with beards and moustaches.</li>
    <li> I used to have a Remington Multigroom kit, but I wasn&#x27;t happy as the battery didn&#x27;t last long and the results were not as I wanted. I decided to buy this kit and I&#x27;m still amazed. It has 5 attachments, it&#x27;s small and really convenient. The results are great!   The shave is as expected and I&#x27;d RECOMMEND it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want a PRO shaving machine, but still are willing to make a little bit of money effort to get great results.</li>
    <li> I purchased this unit and hoped for a great buzzer. I like to use just the unit without the attachments. I just like to trim my beard line and my mustash but you can&#x27;t use this one without the attachment. If you do the head just keeps poping off. I had 2 units send to replace and now im done trying that and going for the moneyback warrenty. Wish it would of worked, but it didn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> Best $30 I ever spent. Clean trimm no tugging or hair pulling. Good enough to shave your head with and a lot faster than clippers in this price range.</li>
    <li> I purchased this trimmer mostly to keep my beard in line and nice and neat.  While the overall performance is not bad, I have had a couple issues that have me thinking about upgrading to a new trimmer.  In fairness - the actual mechanical part is not bad - but the adjustable comb design is not well thought out. When using the comb, I have found that I can not have my hand anywhere near the top of the trimmer, which is counter-intuitive to the way you would normally use it.  The comb does not lock the measurement in, unlike other trimmers, and if you have the trimmer in what I would consider a normal grip, where your thumb is on the back of the unit, you can accidentally change the cutting length.  I have done this twice now, shaving at a 6mm setting, which is my usual, only to have the guide change and go to a 4mm or 2mm in mid-stroke.  Then I have to reshave at the lower length and take the time to grow my beard back out.  What is worse, the change is barely noticeable, with the comb sliding down without you really knowing it, until the pass after the change takes out a bigger chunk than expected.  Most other trimmers seem to have a way to lock the trimming length down, so that it cannot accidentally be changed mid-trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use&lt;br /&gt;The battery seems to last longer than I expected&lt;br /&gt;The cutting power does a decent job on my beard and sideburns&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The poor trimming comb design.  (I don&#x27;t think you could pay me enough to try and use this as a hair trimmer.  I would be afraid of taking a huge chunk out the top of my head if the guide slide.)&lt;br /&gt;Can get hung up on some of the tougher beard hair around your neck and near your ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you are going to just use it occassionally, and can get used to doing your trimming by holding the device way down below where the guide comb attaches, it would not be a bad trimmer.  I find that holding it that low takes away some leverage and makes it harder to get everything even.  I will keep it to use to shave my neck and trim around the edges of my beard and sideburns, but will get something with a better guide comb design for the actual beard trimming.ve my neck and trim around the edges of my beard and sideburns, but will get something with a better guide comb design for the actual beard trimming.</li>
    <li> This machine had been such a delight for 4 months. Very precise and easy to handle. It takes less than one our to get a full battery charge, which gives it enough juice to last for a good 45 minutes. Everything that is said in the description of this product is accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I am giving it a 2-star review is that it broke in its 5th month of regular use (about 2 to 3 times a week). Two weeks ago, after a quick trim, I cleaned the machine and put it back in its pouch as I always do. About 10 minutes later it turned on without anyone touching it and wouldn&#x27;t turn off again; the power switch just stopped working. Needless to say that the machine had never been dropped or misused (I know it sounds like a non sense, but that&#x27;s the truth). I contacted Philips&#x27; customer service to see if they could help, but no, they couldn&#x27;t!! They said that they could only consider replacing it within the US and that since I was in Africa they couldn&#x27;t do mcuh. I decided then to keep using it as it was still functional -it turned on as long as it was charged- and wait until I get back to the US to get it replaced. For two weeks I would put it on charge and use it at the same time, and as soon as I was done I would unplug the cord and let the battery die. It had worked fine that way until today. Now the machine is completely dead! It wouldn&#x27;t charge thus wouldn&#x27;t turn on. It seems like the current doesn&#x27;t go through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed!</li>
    <li> This is a handy grooming tool!  The multitasking implement has attachments to do almost everything.  You can groom facial hair, clip hair, trim nose hair, shave, and detail trim (sideburns, etc.). Each of the attachments works as advertised and it is easy to switch these attachments.  A minor downside is that the plastic guards are a little on the flimsy side, so breaking might be a possibility, but this concern is out weighed by the handiness of the delightful trimmer.</li>
    <li> Good, except it doesn&#x27;t have the right setting for my beard. I like to keep it relatively short, but the 2 setting is too short, and the 4 setting is too long. A 3 would be just right.</li>
    <li> A very handy, good quality tool for men. The battery lasts a very long time between charges. The attachments were easy to change.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item based on the reviews that I read.  It does a decent job overall, but the pieces are too flimsy compared to what I was expecting.  All of the adjustable setting attachments are made of thin plastic, that aren&#x27;t as solid feeling as my old remington clipper.  Also, there are way too many pieces, that I know will just get lost in the shuffle.  Overall, as the title says, good, but not great.</li>
    <li> Every thing is fine. Should see how does it work in the future. Till now it is working fine. Thankyou. Hopefully it will be good</li>
    <li> The trimmer works very fine and it has all the features at less price. The charging time is less and backtime is more which is very helpful and also can be used corded or cordless. Thanks to Philips</li>
    <li> I found this trimmer on sale and was too good a deal to pass up.  It has a great amount of power and has all the tools that I need to take care of myself.  Haven&#x27;t tried the nose trimmer but it looks fine.  This holds a charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> I prefer this unit to the one I owned before.  The power connection is positive as compared to the drop in charging station.  There were more versitile attachments and the power switch worked better on this unit.</li>
    <li> I got this groomer because I wasn&#x27;t very happy with the one I have now. Right out of the box, I was happy with one thing. The plug that goes into the wall is very nicely designed. The chunky adapter part sits horizontally in the outlet instead of vertically. I find those big boxy ones that end up blocking the other outlet annoying. You either have to plan ahead with the plugs, rearrange, or hope that you don&#x27;t have two annoying things like that to plug in at the same time. Next, I use this primarily to trim and maintain my goatee. The beard and moustache comb slides down over the top of the cutting blades and completely surrounds the trimmer. Other trimmers I&#x27;ve used have much flimsier ones that just clip on to the tip of the trimmer. I have always had trouble with those guides flying off. This one is extremely secure. The numbering guide for trimmer length is also extremely easy to see. I&#x27;ve just started using it, but it&#x27;s already one of the best trimmers I&#x27;ve used in the 20 or so years I&#x27;ve been using them. I doubt I&#x27;ll be using it to cut my own hair (I&#x27;m a wuss about that sort of thing), but the precision trimmer has helped me rein in the hair right over my ears. The ear and nose trimmer is one of the least painful ones I&#x27;ve used, too.</li>
    <li> This a lightweight, cordless, shaped for ease of use, great selection of attachments,holds a charge and easy to clean. My husband also said that the gromming tool for the nose does not pull and is painless.  It comes with a nylon bag for storage. My husband said this was the best personal groomer he has ever used. So far, there are no negative issues, just positive. This is a great value for the suggested list price.</li>
    <li> Nice size.  Works great.  Has a few useful attachments.  Stayed charged for weeks of sporadic use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the top piece pops off too easily.</li>
    <li> its a very good product, works great using it since last 5-6 months charged only 3 time long battery life, fair price.</li>
    <li> I am a hairdresser and was looking for some trimmer as a gift that would be a better quality then your cheap trimmers that brake and loose strength  etc. I got this trimmer for my boyfriend based on the reviews. AWESOME! Fast shipping and the product is the best of many many trimmers! Ideal (!) for a long beard, trimming, sculpting hair, did not use it for the buzz cut but I am sure it works just as perfect! If you are looking for something solid, this is it!</li>
    <li> Does a fine job but does not permit me to see the back of my head.  Batteries are good for multiple uses.</li>
    <li> My husband, who is a complete PITA about his facial hair, held onto a non-chargeable groomer b/c he said \\&quot;they don&#x27;t make them this anymore\\&quot;.  Well for Christmas I decided to buy him another, newer, Philips.  HE LOVES IT.  It stays charged, what seems like weeks, but I am sure it&#x27;s just days.  He likes the ease of changing the settings, to get a little closer cut.</li>
    <li> Horrible, like many reviews as soon as the battery depleted, it will no longer charge at all.  CS is absolutely no help either and will do nothing for you.</li>
    <li> Have only used 3 of the attachments in the short time I have owned it.Multigroom has been efficient.Easy to change attachments.Men and women will find this tool fits most needs.</li>
    <li> Bought this product and thought it was good until the small little pin which holds the groom head in place broke.  now I have no way to adjust the length of the groom head.  Normally Philips makes good products.  Not this one.  Design flaw significantly reduced the life of this product.  I would buy something else next time.</li>
    <li> Pros: 1. Battery lasts very long with one charge&lt;br /&gt;  2. Lots of useful attachments&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: 1. Attachments fall off easily is too much pressure is applied while trimming.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor my 28-year-old son has ever used.  He says best for if you want some facial hair - perhaps not as good for clean shave every day.  The adapter for clean shave is only about an inch wide.  It works well when you need it, but if daily ritual would take too long.  What he loves about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* great if you want some facial here - short-trimmed well-kept beard - once over every morning and it comes out perfect&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* comes with pretty much every adapter you want&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* great for head shaving&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* effortless and painless shaving&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* all of the adapters are easy to snap on and off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* have dropped adapters and they didn&#x27;t break - very durable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* been using it for an entire year and battery still works and still shaves just as well as the first day</li>
    <li> no complaints so far. the battery holds a charge for a long time and it came with a nice assortment of attachments.</li>
    <li> this shaver comes with so many different attachments and for the value ($25 after coupon ) it was worth trying out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-when you change the head attachment there is no grip and when your hands are wet or even dry it can be difficult getting the head out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-overall the structure just feels very cheaply made, the weight is very light and the plastic seems like it would easily break if the shaver happened to fall down&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-they call this a multigroom shaver but it can&#x27;t be used for the chest area, none of the attachments worked effectively</li>
    <li> I originally had an old version from Norelco but did not like it.  Then I tried various other brand named products like  Remington, Whall etc. but had to return them.  This newer model is much better than the old one and serves my needs.  I am very happy with it and will recommend others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Philips-Norelco beard trimmers since the mid-90&#x27;s, usually replacing them when they absolutely will not hold a charge anymore. About two years ago, my wife bought me a Multigroom, which seemed like a great idea, but the plastic attachments and gards were all very low quality, and ended up losing teeth or cracking at the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I&#x27;d give the new model a shot, before writing off the series entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortuately, I can&#x27;t report there have been many improvements. Yes, you get lots of nice attachments, but really, you&#x27;re probably going to settle in to a couple of them. And that&#x27;s when you&#x27;ll begin to notice that while it&#x27;s nice to have the weird nose-hair trimmer attachment to go with your beard trimmer / hair clippers, for about as much money, you could have had a much nicer beard trimmer or hair clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless this is something you plan to throw in a travel bag from time to time, I can&#x27;t really recommend it as being durable enough to stand up to daily use.</li>
    <li> I ordered this beard trimmer/multigroomer from the uk after reading all the good reviews. It did not disappoint  excellent beard trimmer it feels like you just been to the barber. All the little heads from close shavers to the small hair trimmers work fine. I would have listed this in the 5 star category but the adjustable grading heads for the trimmers are a bit flimsy and need manually adjusting because the plastic distorts, otherwise fine. The lithium ion battery is powerful and will not let you down make sure it is always charged otherwise the battery will become obsolete.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco Multigroom Pro as a awesome shaver, cuts close without irritating the skin particles will give years of cutting and shaping of your hairs.</li>
    <li> Great attachments and holds a charge forever. Great for trimming. Great for trimming any beard type. Would recommend  to anyone</li>
    <li> My goals for getting this particular piece of trimmer were modest.  I have cut my own hair and my own beard for many years, but hated doing it with a corded trimmer.  This one frees me from that restriction.  It cuts well, recharges quickly and stores easily in the bag that is provided.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for a groomer that finally bit the dust.  It works very well.  Only drawback is that is has no stand to hold the items like my previous one.  Otherwise, it works fine.</li>
    <li> Works great, love that I can continue to use it when the battery runs out by simply plugging it in and keep on trimming. It charges very quickly and is potent when it is on batter alone, good product.</li>
    <li> I received this trimmer a week ago. The blades don&#x27;t cut the hair short enough for the foil to catch, and it rips out about half of the hairs instead of cutting them. The guard slips out of place while I was trimming my beard, dropping from 12 to 2, leaving me with an inch-wide stripe of missing hair. I&#x27;ve spent three days trying to return it now and no one will give me a refund so I&#x27;m just out 30 dollars. If I could give this 1 star I would.</li>
    <li> I needed a shaver to: trim my goatee, trim my ear hair, trim my nose hair.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver does all I needed with better results than I expected at the price. The different length combs give a great selection, as ,most people will only need 1 or 2 lengths out of the many selections available.&lt;br /&gt;The heads are easily switched with no fuss or muss or engineering degree.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver has the looks and feel of a well made product.&lt;br /&gt;For battery life; I charged it completely when I received it and have not had to re-charge it after 6 complete uses, (well above my expectations)&lt;br /&gt;All in all for the price I could not be any happier with this shaver.</li>
    <li> i really love this product. it simply does what it says... works like a charm to me, though the mini shaver could have been better.</li>
    <li> Dear Sir or Madam:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had Philips Norelce QG3270 for awhile.  Unfortunalely, it does not trim enough from my full beard at the closest setting.  However, I use it that way.  I also use the trimmer for haircuts.  At least I get some use out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently bought the beard trimmer model BT9285/41 9100.  I thought my issue was solved.  Unfortunately, using the detail trimmer and all of its settings,  it takes off way too much beard.  There really is not any difference on all the settings.  On the setting for the maximum length which is seven, it takes off way too much beard as it does on setting two or lower.  I have to send it back for a refund and stick with what I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If somone can help me to chose a different model, I would be most appreciative.  I do like your product, but my expenerience with the aforementioned does not do what the instructions say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A long time ago I had model T7900, which is discontinued.  I had it for about 15 years.  It did everything I needed it to do.  I surely miss it.  I cannot believe after all this time that Philips Norelco cannot come up with better innovations.  I am just being honest.  I have had other brands which are much worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert M. Ellenbogen</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to my boyfriend. He has been using for over 2 years now with no problem. It gives him a close and easy shave and it&#x27;s very simple to use. Some groomers are so complicated in designs and such but this one is simple and lightweight. It&#x27;s hard to clean though, that&#x27;s the only con.</li>
    <li> Love this shaver. I never completely shave my face clean because I look like a little boy when I do but I love this shaver because it gives me that scruffy look that I want.</li>
    <li> I was expecting that it will give a smooth trim, but its not.&lt;br /&gt; It makes lot of noise. I think this is due to the friction in the blades are high. Thats why it even get hot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only liked the nose trimmer part.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t feel its worth buying.</li>
    <li> This is the only one I&#x27;m using to trim my gotee,and it works&lt;br /&gt;very,very good,I did bought many over the years,but after&lt;br /&gt;I bought this one,the others they were going into the drawer&lt;br /&gt;never to see the light again.It looks the charge last forever,and&lt;br /&gt;the plastic cover/slider that give you the cutting length very easy&lt;br /&gt;to maneuver,also very easy to clean,overall a good buy,very happy.&lt;br /&gt;I will recomend it</li>
    <li> I have had several of these in the same series over the years.  The only reason I ever buy a new one is because I lose the parts.  Kids, maids, wife, never me..., somehow get lost, so I am forced to repurchase.  I would buy it again tomorrow.  Charges fast, and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> I had this model for just over a year &amp; worked well all that time, till it broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$60 p/year, is it work it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still saved on hair cuts, but was hoping for 2-3 years...</li>
    <li> easy and quickly, working good. I like it, good job and yes, i would recommend this to all my friends.&lt;br /&gt;thanks!</li>
    <li> I have only used it on my beard but the mechanism for locking the beard guard in place is excellent and I have been using it for a month almost daily without needing to charge it.  Excellent product - would recommend!</li>
    <li> Very neat compact design and solid construction.  Easy to adjust, hold, and use.  Truly multi-groom and leaves a very even cut.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several months now.  Great product that performs as advertised.  The separation and ability to wash the key components is a really nice feature.  Also, the blades are staying sharp and continue to perform as good as my very first trim!  Battery life is also excellent.</li>
    <li> Trimmer got wet from washing my face in the sink and no longer worked. Just be careful and i&#x27;m sure the device will work fine.</li>
    <li> This is really a trimmer, but it is a good one. I shave all over, my wife likes it like that. I have used it many times and it wont &#x27;bite&#x27;. For the price it fits right in with all my grooming aids. I like the nose hair trimmer and other sensitive areas. Hair holds body odor and personal hygiene is very important to me especially after 6 years of shipboard life in the U S NAVY. AMAZON sells this at such a low price, it is loaded with attachments.</li>
    <li> I love this clipper they work great, it&#x27;s quiet and safe. I like it better then my other Norelco very happy with them.</li>
    <li> After one year the on-off switch stopped working; the trimmer continues to buzz away until its charge is finally used up.</li>
    <li> I use it every week; don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without it.  It is very versatile because of all the different heads.</li>
    <li> Excellent groomer, the multiple attachments are really useful.  Holds a charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> I use this product as beard trimmer and the quality is good. Some people said it&#x27;s too noisy but I don&#x27;t think so. The battery is really long, I think I charge it once a month for few hours.</li>
    <li> I use Philips shaver so order this and proved to be of same quality. I like the battery life and ease of trimming without getting hot and works with all sizes of hair.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is very flimsy and broke after just a few uses.  There is a thin, spring-loaded tab which broke off, making the use of the attachments impossible.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this clipper/trimmer set. The build quality is good - feels substantial. Very easy to change out the clipper heads, and the set includes a nice assortment for pretty much any trimming task. The only attachment that I found a bit sub-par is the nose hair clipper. I prefer the Philips Norelco NT9110 Precision Nose and Ear Trimmer for that task. But, all the other attachments are well done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to this set I was using the Wahl Lithium Ion all in one trimmer. That&#x27;s also a fine trimmer, but I prefer the Norelco mainly due to the fact that the attachments on the Norelco are easier to attach and swap out (plus there are more of them). The Wahl does an equally good job of cutting, but the attachments take a bit of dexterity to ensure they are properly attached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good battery life, and the heads are washable under the tap. All in all, an excellent and versatile trimmer.</li>
    <li> I have never been so unimpressed by a purchase despite wanting to like it. It simply wasnt close enough or good enough for the job. It just didnt trim the hair. I wanted to like the design and portability but it just didnt do what it was supposed to do: Trimming. Was a frustrating experience, it will be some time before I make up my mind to try another trimming device.</li>
    <li> Originally bought these in January 2012 and have had ZERO problems with them. The cut is still quality, the moving parts and accessories have all worked seemlessly as well. I originally bought these more for the grooming options... Closer shave, mustache trimmer, be careful with the genital area (as always) but still overall a great grooming tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as cutting your hair with these... I shave my head (no guard) about once every 2 weeks, and the cut is extremely close. I thought maybe it was getting too close so I bought the Philips QC5360, which is more for cutting hair as the width is wider. The Philips QC5360 has since had problems with the overall recharging capacity diminishing (I normally have to charge it every time for a head shave that takes a total of 15 minutes). So now it&#x27;s just strictly back to these Philips Norelco QG3270.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great pair of clippers/grooming tool.</li>
    <li> Great Shaver.  I love the attachments.  Super light so it travels with me.  Super long battery life too which is nice so I don&#x27;t bring the cord  on the road.</li>
    <li> This is perfect razor was worried it was gonna be flimsy but at the end of day i have had it  awhile and it holds up well if you don&#x27;t break it</li>
    <li> Writing as wife and mother of those who use this tool in our home. First off let me tell you about all the things that I dont like about the WAHL that my husband and kid(s) were using till the Norelco arrived. The case is big and bulky, with smooth corners and edges it takes up a lot of room and seems to always be sliding off of a shelf. It has lots and lots of attachments of which we use only two or three on a regular basis more than three only when mohawks are called for during football season. The groomer itself is large, heavy and bulky and is incapable at this point in it&#x27;s life cycle to get really close to the skin or do any detail at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the Norelco; the groomer itself is very light and surprisingly came out of the box charged. It comes with two hair clipper attachments (one for beard and mustache) both can be positioned at different levels for different hair length options. Of the remaining attachments (beard trimmer, mini shaver, precision trimmer, nose/ear hair trimmer) I have used the mini shaver which was perfect for getting around the top of the outer ears, the precision trimmer to detail the backs of both my husband&#x27;s and son&#x27;s necks and both worked exceptionally well. My husband did his own hair and initially worried that the hair clipper attachment would not get close enough to his skin but then he figured out how to adjust the hair length setting and it worked great. He also tried the nose/ear hair trimmer and said both worked really well. I worried that the smooth handle might be difficult to grip especially since the groomer is so light but he said that it was not a problem. The true test will be if the Norelco will maintain this level of precision and for that only time will tell. I will update this review over time as to the performance of the multi groomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I posted a few pics of what&#x27;s in the box, the carrying storage bag and a couple of heads that will be using it regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE*** 05-18-2011&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for detail work in *ahem* all areas, but has not replaced the workhorse WAHL hair clipper as I had hoped. Even with the kids fine hair, I need to stop and dump out the cuttings every ten seconds or so because the design does not allow the hair to exit the groomer on it&#x27;s own. So we use the old clunker to take most of the hair off and use the Norelco to clean up the edges and make everything neat and tidy. I am sticking with my original five stars because of it&#x27;s excellent performance in all areas but this one. It is well used in our home.in *ahem* all areas, but has not replaced the workhorse WAHL hair clipper as I had hoped.

    <li> I agree with all the previous positive reviews attesting to the high quality of this groomer. It has a multitude of attachments, including a hair clipper, two combs for height-adjustable hair and beard trimming, a nose/ear/eyebrow trimmer, a precision trimmer, and a mini foil shaver. This means that aside from shaving, you can basically take care of all the hair on your face and scalp with this one product. (It&#x27;s not really meant to replace a razor for everyday shaving)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit itself is very lightweight and has a nice ergonomic shape for easy grasping. The battery charger is compact and has a long cord. About the only downside to the product is that while trying to pull off the comb attachment, a couple of times I also accidentally removed the entire head, which you&#x27;re only supposed to do when cleaning the groomer. Other than that, very nice product, and the lithium ion battery is a plus also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this. It&#x27;s nice to finally have something cordless for my face. My beard was getting very long and I was tired of using my old clippers to trim it. I&#x27;m sure that there is much better on the market than this, but I feel this is a great value. The different attachments are nice to have. I bought this mainly to trim my beard.  Pros:  1. Small form factor.  2. Charges fast and has a good long charge to use.  3. 2 year warranty  4. Battery charge indicator LED.  5. I&#x27;ve had great results with the \\&quot;beard and mustache comb\\&quot;  Cons:  1. The \\&quot;mini shaver\\&quot; attachment doesn&#x27;t even cut my facial hair. Foil shavers have never worked at all for me, but this one is the worst I&#x27;ve ever seen.  2. I find the cable for the charger very annoying. Because of the way it was packaged it won&#x27;t straighten for probably the first 12 uses; if it ever does.  3. The length adjustment for each comb attachment is not what I was expecting. It does it&#x27;s job, but it seems that they could have done something more similar to the [[ASIN:B004QHDJNI Philips Norelco Qc5340/40 Hair Clipper Pro]]&#x27;s length adjustment system.  Conclusion:  This is primarily a beard trimmer, at least that&#x27;s how I will use it. If the hair on my heard was a buzz cut then I would maintain it with this as well. The attachments work fine except the mini shaver does the worst job ever. I am very pleased with the overall performance and power of this little guy. I would recommend this to anyone that doesn&#x27;t shave often who wants to maintain a short beard and/or mustache.</li>
    <li> I bought this to get the 5 O&#x27;clock shadow look at 8 am.  It works well and is easy to use.  There is exceptional value for the moneye.  Love it!</li>
    <li> These are great clippers. Much better than the new norelco clippers. Highly recommended for hair and beard.</li>
    <li> Nice product, very nice!  Works consistently and reliably.  Rock solid.  Easy to use.  Fit comfortably in your hand, perfectly balanced.</li>
    <li> I grabbed this for 23 bucks including shipping.. just want to give it a trail.. after using 4 to 5 times, i started liking it... I am not completely satisfied nor dissatisfied...Its a kinda good for the price... Dont expect Zero shave..&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;very portable and charging lasts for a month..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;beard &amp; mustache trimming is not that smooth..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like this product.... But if ur looking for a very smooth beard trimming this is not recommended.</li>
    <li> Its good for trimming a beard, but not so much for shaving. Irritates skin, I would not recommend it if you want to use it for shaving and want a clean shave</li>
    <li> The product stopped working in 1 month. The quality of trimming was okayish.&lt;br /&gt;The build quality is cheap and extensions do not fit as well on the main device.</li>
    <li> This thing is great! I use the beard trimmer with the depth gauge and the nose hair trimmer regularly. Both work extremely well and changing over takes about 5 seconds. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I got this last september and 3 months into using it, the power button went out. The trimmer always stays on. Now i have to just let the battery drain out for it to stop.</li>
    <li> I have been using this now for about 3 months. It has been easy to use. My only complaint/suggestion would be to include a better attachment for facial hair. All in all, a great bargain for what it can do.</li>
    <li> the noise is too loud</li>
    <li> I use this to trim my beard and so far its worked exceptionally. I&#x27;ve only used maybe 2 of the attachments but they are strong and don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re going to break or wear out any time soon. The battery also lasts forever and I haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet since I bought it a few weeks ago!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned maybe 3 other buzzers, but this one gets fully charged in less than an hour, lasted me over 2 months so far and I haven&#x27;t charged it again. I physically can&#x27;t recommend this more.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product through Amazon around 3 months back, believe it or not i have charged only once and used this product for trimming my beard for more than 10 times and i didn&#x27;t charged this item it yet...loved using it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Powerful battery backup&lt;br /&gt;Design&lt;br /&gt;Comfort&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Few times this product dis-mantles during trimming.&lt;br /&gt;Non-washable :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though there are few cons on this product, still i would like to rate this item as 5star - because of it&#x27;s powerful lithium battery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have not got a chance to use all the blades in this package, but for what ever I have started using it is great. I liked how it charges very fast. The only complain is the pouch, which will make it difficult to find a specific attachment. You will have to empty everything to find the right blade and then put all of them back in the pouch, otherwise it is a great space saver.</li>
    <li> I was using a Remington trimmer previously for a number of years and it stopped working after perhaps one to many drops.  After considering the various trimmer options, I opted for the Multigroom pro.  It is comfortable to handle and changing heads is easy enough.  I played with the various trimmer heads and suspect I will settle on 3 of the available heads.  In using the Multigroom pro for about a month, these are my initial observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Nose / ear trimmer does not trim hair very short.  Compared to what I use to use, I was formally able to get away with trimming stray hairs on the outer ear.  With this adapter, it is suitable as it was designed to do (inside the nose and ear canal).  I have to use the micro-screen adapter for the outside of my ears and other rogue hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Small Trimmer does a great job and the adjustable guide handles nicely.  It is numbered so you can set to the desired height once you establish your preference.  I wish it offered a little more granularity though.  Where setting #2 is almost to short, setting #4 is to high.  You would think that there would be a #3 but the trimmer guide wasn&#x27;t locked in place between #2 and #4 for me and so it would easily ratchet up or down.  Minor issue though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Storage. I wish this trimmer had a more elegant method of storing the extra accessories.  It came with a bag but it was overkill for the way I want to use it. I want to store the unused accessories separately but don&#x27;t want to lose them in a bag at the bottom of a drawer.  A plastic container or tray  that would house the charger and accessories would have been a nicer touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all though, I like the Multigroomer and would recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a Norelco G380 AIO trimmer that I had stupidly burned out by leaving it plugged in too long (ALWAYS read the manual).  I almost went with the Wahl 9854-600; however, I am familiar with and like the way the Norelco combes/heads adjust, so I decided to go with this model.  So far, I have been very pleased.  The Li-Ion battery charges quickly, holds its charge, and the unit seems to be more powerful than the G380.  I would strongly recommend against the cheaper Norelco models that run on NiCad batteries -- over time the batteries wear down or burn out if you leave them plugged in too long (like I did).  The only complaint I have about this unit is that it DOES NOT come with the plastic storage tray like the other Norelco AIO&#x27;s.  It only comes with a fabric travel pouch.  That&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> Works well for the first time one month ago.  I tried to use it again last night and found out it is dead.  It did not turn on nor get charging.  Thinking to send it back to manufacture.</li>
    <li> it stopped working after using it once. the battery seemed to have died. it won&#x27;t recharge at all. tried different outlets, still nothing. Can&#x27;t be used even if plugged in.  but the one time i did use it, the trimmer was great. it wasn&#x27;t loud and worked well. clear plastic attachments are really flimsy though. the trimmer fits well in the hand. wish it didn&#x27;t die so quickly, would have given it 4 stars but now its 1.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this over a month and use it every other day or so. It&#x27;s still on its initial charge! I&#x27;ve used all the attachements for something or other. I even had my daughter give me a buzz cut with the biggest cutter head, followed by trimming and shaving with the close trimmer and minishaver head. Nice little unit. More versatile than the older Philips beard trimmer I had previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;01/29/2013 UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;My usage pattern has not changed, about every other day I touch up something. I finally had to recharge it 2 days ago. It ran from mid-November to late January on one charge! Two and a half months. Very happy with this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Suffered through using this for about a year before it broke.  I used it about once a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the same as most cheap Chinese made trimmers, a small plastic piece rotates and moves the trimmer heads back and forth for cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It finally broke, so I can buy a quality trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Pulls hair, doesn&#x27;t trim hair very short (on neck)&lt;br /&gt;extremely loud&lt;br /&gt;cheap plastic pieces fall off when trimming&lt;br /&gt;storage bag is cheap and has fallen apart&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion I will be very wary of buying any Phillips product in the future.  The last few products I have purchased of this brand have been poor quality.</li>
    <li> my son in law loved it as a gift he asked for it and was happy to purchase it here.</li>
    <li> Seems I have to replace one of these every couple years.  This one is no different.  The attachments pop off as you are using them.  Not fun when you have one of them up your nose!</li>
    <li> My wife cuts the family&#x27;s hair and I trim my beard. We had hair clippers and beard trimmers and various guards and whatnots. Then my beard trimmer gave out and I had to find another. I stumbled across the Multigroom Pro and liked the simple but effective looking attachments, so i bought it. This thing is great! When I first got it, I plugged it in to charge for an hour. Then i tried it out. The heft of the trimmer is solid and fits my hand perfectly. The attachments are very effective. You know, as guys get older, we get hair in places it should be illegal to have hair. I have an uncle with beards coming out of his ears. I think he does it just to annoy my aunt. My wife, however, would not be so tolerant. With every other trimmer I&#x27;ve tried, trimming my ear and nose hair has been difficult, painful and has taken much longer than I like to spend with such tasks. The Multigroom knocks it out extramely quickly and much better than ever before. As for my beard, it works great. I&#x27;m able to keep everything neatly trimmed with no problems. The surprise came when I trimmed my sideburns. It gave such a clean cut, I got the idea to see if I could trim around my ears. I followed the instructions ans gave myself a neat trim very quickly. I ended up giving myself a fairly good haircut in half the time it takes my wife. Next thing I knew, she was cutting the kids hair with it and the regular clippers were set aside for the dog. As for the battery, I&#x27;ve been using it for two months now (five haircuts and daily trims) on the original one hour charge. The only con is that it doesn&#x27;t have a stand, but overall I still give it five stars.</li>
    <li> Purchased the product after returning the Qc5340 Hair Pro.  These clippers while not as robust (more like beard trimmer) still do the job on the head.  They have a expanded &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; clipper which is larger, thus covering more surface area, which is nice.  Head clipper still doesn&#x27;t cut hair short enough to constitute a &amp;#34;buzz,&amp;#34; but you can follow up with the beard trimmer to get a closer cut.  Overall, seems like good quality.</li>
    <li> Despite the mixed reviews, I decided to give this a shot. Unfortunately, I was one of the disappointed users. The best attachment for the closest shave was the screened trimmer, but it kept popping off. Plus that&#x27;s just isn&#x27;t enough for what I need this product for. I need to be able to shape up my hairline, trim my beard down to a near clean-shaven look &amp; I also use it to trim my head hair. This trimmer would not give me a close enough trim &amp; would miss some hairs as well. I had to return it. I just purchased a Wahl beard trimmer from a local beauty supply store for $27 &amp; it works wonders!</li>
    <li> Short and sweet:  it whirs like a well built car, solid, with wonderful shaving heads, and looks and feels built to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But: the depth guide attachments, designed to be compatible with the various widths of trim heads:  are oversized, strangely cowl shaped, do not precisely fit the body or heads, and are difficult to remove once seated.  After trying a few times, I set aside the depth guides - forever - seriously at a loss to imagine how someone can put them to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that - of course - limits my use for this trimmer.  When I do use it, I&#x27;m forced to trim freehand (there&#x27;s a test of steady skill), or else I improvise by placing a plain black pocket comb in between the cutters, and me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wild.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband as his last groomer finally called it quits after 10 years.  He uses it for the basics, ears, sideburns, nose, etc.  He really likes it a lot.  No complaints so far.</li>
    <li> Battery lasts a long time between charges. Adjustable guide is kind of cheap- pops off frequently when you make adjustments. This isn&#x27;t a big deal to me but still a design weakness.</li>
    <li> Great comfortable shaving compared to its price. Good buy. Sometimes it is hard to clean and you cant do wet shaves, but if you know how to use it, you shouldnt have any problems</li>
    <li> Bought this over a year ago and still going strong. I use it on my hair and beard, because I dont feel like paying $15 for a haircut and a few dollars for a tip every month and shaving. Overall, good product.</li>
    <li> I bought this trying to go on the cheap! lol! :o It was NOT a success! I wanted a good trimmer without having to pay a ton of money for it. Well, this [[ASIN:B004QWPIO6 Philips Norelco QG3270 Multigroom Pro]] I&#x27;m sure is great for a man&#x27;s face and head but NOT for a woman&#x27;s bikini area (especially if your going for a more Brazilian type look)! It will slice and dice you and you will end up a bloody mess in the end with some hairs uncut. I even used the mini shaver and it sliced me up. I am returning this immediately and getting something else like maybe the [[ASIN:B00742JW88 Philips HP6376 Bikini Perfect Bikini Trimmer, White/Pink]] or the [[ASIN:B00005JS5C Panasonic ES246AC Bikini Shaper and Trimmer]]! I think that there is a reason that their are women&#x27;s bikini trimmers, even though they cost more, I now think that you get what you pay for. Oh well, so much for my theory that women&#x27;s things are more expensive just because we are women! lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look for my review of either of those trimmers in a few months! I will let you know how they work! :3</li>
    <li> Previous to the Noreleco Qg3270 I owned a Remington Titanium MB300.  That little trimmer was fantastic with a long battery life, ergonomic design and adjustable head that stayed locked in place.  I guarded it closely and took great care of it until the day that I set it down just a little to close to a space heater.  The plastic forks were mangled beyond repair and it was time to buy a new one.  Quickly, I discovered that Remington had replaced the MB300 with an inferior product.  After a couple of weeks of trying 4 or 5 other units I stumbled across this baby.  The only thing that is inferior to the Remington is that it lacks the ergonomic design. Everything else is superior.  Battery life is excellent.  I think that it has only been charged 3-4 times since I bought it a year ago.  It also seems more powerful and the blades seem sharper.  When I initially took it out of the box I thought that the adjustable head was an inferior design and would slip under any kind of reasonable pressure.  After a year of use I can say that it has worked flawlessly.  Wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy another one and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this unit to replace an inexpensive (and now discontinued) Norelco beard trimmer. It gave me excellent service for several years, but it showed signs of age recently. First the power cord&#x27;s connection became intermittent, and then it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge very long. Eventually the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge at all. I looked at the current offerings from Norelco, and this one seemed to be a good combination of price and features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impressions of this unit were that it was half the weight of the old unit. My second impression was that there sure are a lot of attachments. My previous trimmer had a trimmer blade with an adjustable guide, and a tiny mustache trimmer that slid out when needed. This trimmer reminds me more of an electric toothbrush. There&#x27;s a motor/handle assembly, and four different snap-on attachments: A hair trimmer with sliding/removable guide, a beard trimmer with sliding/removable guide, a tiny mustache trimmer, and a nose and ear trimmer. There&#x27;s also an external switching-type charger and a nylon bag to keep all the parts in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer and attachments do feel light and insubstantial, compared to my previous trimmer, but they work every bit as well- if not better. The blades on this new unit seem to move much faster, and cut better than the old trimmer (which, granted, was getting old and worn out). I didn&#x27;t try the hair trimmer, but all the other attachments work just fine- even the nose and ear trimmer, which I was afraid might grab and yank hairs (it didn&#x27;t). One big improvement in this unit is that the attachments can be rinsed in the sink, instead of partially disassembling it and working the hair out with as stiff brush, as I had to do with my previous trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only time will tell how well this trimmer holds up over time. I&#x27;ll report back and update this review if I run into any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After six months of regular use, I have to say that this trimmer has exceeded all my expectations. It cuts beautifully, the accessories are actually useful, and battery life in phenomenal. It runs for months without needing a recharge.l my expectations. It cuts beautifully, the accessories are actually useful, and battery life in phenomenal. It runs for months without needing a recharge.</li>
    <li> I have had an experience with this product that does not appear to be too uncommon. After 2 months of light useage it just refused to turn on or accept a charge. Kudos to Phillips/Norelco for the two year warranty (which is what earned them 2 stars and not one) but the return process so far involves a 20 minute chat session for preliminary approval, now I need to send them the receipt from Amazon which they will verify in 2-3 days, then I have to ship the item back at my expense. Eventually I might get a replacement by which time it will have been better if I had just spent $30 on a new razor from a different manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the photo Amazon is featuring. This shaver has no base. If you want a trimmer that sits on your countertop on a charging base, this trimmer&#x27;s not for you. Hopefully Amazon will change this photo. The trimmer, however, works very well and I don&#x27;t mind storing it in a drawer. I hope the plastic guards hold up. I have gone through numerous trimmers because the guards break and are difficult to replace. These seem fairly sturdy.</li>
    <li> I mainly use this unit with the adjustable beard/mustache comb to trim my goatee to a uniform length. Other brands I&#x27;ve owned came with multiple clip-on combs that would break at the clip-on point every couple months, even though I am not rough on my things. This unit has a sliding adjustable comb that is not subject to those repeated stresses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is the slide adjustment for the comb does not have much &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; at each click, so if you&#x27;re not careful you can accidentally bump the comb adjustment and trim your goat a little too close (happened once, now I double-check the setting before each use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the other attachments much, nor can I compare the closeness of the shave to other shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy this unit again.</li>
    <li> This one is good on charging. Just in 1hour it fully get charged and ready for use. No need to charge for a long time compare to other Norelco models. Extensions are good and nicely cleaned with water too. clippers are good and strong.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this who do trimming or body grooming daily.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a good trimmer and this is it. Use the QG part number when ordering. I purchased the all-black model at Kohls when on vacation but found it out of stock online when I got home. This is the silver model, no other difference.&lt;br /&gt;Price is very good, and solid quality well meets it. In my opinion the designer of this gem had a seriously epic beard to maintain, because it&#x27;s got all the goodies... even the clip-on regulators have a nice click-control depth setting and are made of clear plastic--easy to keep clean. Cord/cordless operation will probably give this device a nice long lifespan.</li>
    <li> this worked great, however please use caution. I had nicked my skin a dozen times and have permanent skin tags from it</li>
    <li> What do you want me to say. Its a razor. I need a minimum number of words. These are them.</li>
    <li> I have used the Norelco Multigroom Pro for several months now and it has worked extremely well. Battery life is excellent. Althought it came with several heads and attachments, I use the wide trimmer head and the adjustable cutting length attachment. My wife cuts my hair which paid for the product during the second hair cut. I also use it to trim my beard and mustache and it just does it all well.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with this trimmer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d really give this a 3.5, but I rounded up, to be fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - Very light and powerful, easily chops right through hair&lt;br /&gt;2 - 2Lithium battery, great life, lasts a long time between charges&lt;br /&gt;3 - Can use when plugged in (should you need to when battery is dead, unlikely, see #4 below)&lt;br /&gt;4 - Rapid charge-- charges up enough for a quick trim in a few minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;(Note, this is compared to other products, but overall, the positives outweigh the negatives in quality)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - accessory/trim parts are a bit clumsy-&lt;br /&gt;----------the beard height adjuster is kinda flimsy-- it won&#x27;t break but is is not as well-designed as some other models&lt;br /&gt;----------You have to remove the main blade and attach the other blades (mustache trimmer, nose hair trimmer, etc)- no pop-up design&lt;br /&gt;2 - No stand (which I don&#x27;t care about, but you may)&lt;br /&gt;3 - (edit) trimmer setting does not get as low as some others (see bottom of review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t count this as a con, but there is one brand, maybe panasonic, I can&#x27;t remember, that has a little vacuum function to decrease the cut hairs getting all over. However, it doesn&#x27;t work perfectly anyway, and I don&#x27;t see it as a major advantage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I have used a few of these, 2 of which I purchased at Amazon. One just sucks totally (Man groomer - see my review if you&#x27;re interested). The other main one is the Remington MB300, which is great, but the battery stopped holding a charge pretty quickly. It functions fine, and you can use it plugged in, just can&#x27;t take it on a trip for a few days without the charger. That one is probably a nicad battery, I think they might have one with a Li battery now, would be worth checking out. I just did, actually, it is the [[ASIN:B005PUZZR8 Remington MB4040 Lithium Ion Powered Men&#x27;s Rechargeable Mustache and Beard Trimmer]], sold here on Amazon. Looks like they changed it, no more pop up trimmer (more like this Norelco) but it does have the dial adjustable beard height, which is much nicer. I might pick one of them up, actually, and have this as a backup/travel unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to add one point in this edit: The trimmer settings for this unit do not get as low as for the Remington, so there is a bit of a gap between no guard, or 0 setting, and the next lowest, which is 1 or 2 on the Remington, but 4 on this one. That is actually pretty key if you like to keep your beard at a very close 1 or 2 setting (which I do, sometimes, actually).) but it does have the dial adjustable beard height, which is much nicer. I might pick one of them up, actually, and have this as a backup/travel unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to add one point in this edit: The trimmer settings for this unit do not get as low as for the Remington, so there is a bit of a gap between no guard, or 0 setting, and the next lowest, which is 1 or 2 on the Remington, but 4 on this one.

    <li> You&#x27;ll never get wrong with this. Very good product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> For the price I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting as good a trimmer as this is so I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;It has performed very well so far ( 2 times a week ).&lt;br /&gt;For the $$ I can recommend this without a doubt.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cordless hair clipper that would hold a charge and have a good amount of power.&lt;br /&gt;This item is great.  All the attachments work very well and it&#x27;s still going strong!  I will definitely buy another when this one wears out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up</li>
    <li> I use it every month or so and it does a great job. I save money by cutting my own hair (I&#x27;m a guy). I would recommend it</li>
    <li> I got this product around 2 months ago, for the first month I thought this was a great little trimmer/multi groomer it charged relatively quickly, it is very light and portable and I found the precision detail attachment particularly useful for creating a sleek and neat finishes on all trims and cuts. However this wasn&#x27;t to last..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging on this product is surely its downfall, It doesn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s charge anywhere near as long as it did the first time I charged it but it gets worse and worse. The amount of charge given to the device seems to decrease with every use until I ended up with no charge at all!! I even bought another charger for it ( not the cheapest or easiest chargers to get hold of ) but to no avail the product just wont charge again, no light, nothing! Needless to say I will never buy this trimmer again, you end up paying more in the long run to replace it when it dies. The price reflects the quality in this case, badly made and not worth the hassle in my opinion!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over a year now. I simply loved the product and m very satisfied with the results. Will highly recommend this..</li>
    <li> It was a gift for someone and they were very happy with it.  They had previously owned one and wanted the same one.</li>
    <li> Best bang for your buck. Easy to clean and operate. Battery last long enough for a \\&quot;full use\\&quot; quick recharge. Comes with lots of attachments.</li>
    <li> Works good and hold a good charge. I do not like how easily the head comes off and it frequently causes problems.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best trimmers I&#x27;ve owned, but it has a major flaw.  There is a tiny spring-loaded piece which is supposed to keep the depth setting on the attachements in place, but it broke within the first week I had this.  Now I can not adjust the depth on the attachments that need it, so I&#x27;m mainly just using it as a nose hair trimmer.</li>
    <li> very good product, my friend recommended this product to me and I will recommend to all my friends. I like this product very much.</li>
    <li> It has many benefits for me. I really like it. i can&#x27;t explain what can i do with it but i&#x27;m sure it works with everybody.</li>
    <li> It was giving as a Christmas gift.  It what he wanted and what he got.  He loves it. Takes it out of town with him on work.</li>
    <li> I had the previous model beard/hair groomer and was pleased, except that it would no longer hold a charge. This new unit exceeds the quality of the old one in a much more even cut on both my beard and hair, as well as charging quicker and holding a charge much longer. I definitely recommend this unit. Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> I used this item about once every few months since I bought it about 2 years ago. It worked fine, though because I didn&#x27;t use it frequently the battery tended to drain on its own so I had to charge it even though I&#x27;d only used it for 5 minutes previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last time I went to use it (did nothing different), it wasn&#x27;t working. Usually it&#x27;s just low on power, but it didn&#x27;t turn on. I figured the battery had just completely run out, so I went to charge it. The charging light didn&#x27;t go on, it wouldn&#x27;t turn on while plugged in, and even after letting it charge overnight, it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. So now I&#x27;m left with a useless broken razor.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied, a product of excellent quality. I put 5 stars for all categories. I have recommended this product to my friends</li>
    <li> Great multigroom, battery life is amazing.. Great buy</li>
    <li> Have hardly used it for 5-10 times. it doesnt charge now.&lt;br /&gt;Spend lot of time talking to philips support and got a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;the replaced part also has the same issue. the charger stops working after 5-10 times.</li>
    <li> Great razor and the battery lasts so long on one charge. I use this almost daily for months now and it is going as strong as the day I got it.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver. I like that it is water proof and it does a great job at removing hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace the cheaper model of this shaver that i had for two years with no complaints. I just got this in the mail today and its going back. The shave heads snap on and off unlike the \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; model which requires you push a button to release the head. modest pressure at a 45 degree angle and the heads pop off. Also of note, on the norelco website, it looks like a brushed aluminum like surface but its actually a mirror/finger print prone finish. The height adjustment system is also an inferior design, it clicks along this cheap little plastic lip. I can see it wearing down and losing its friction.</li>
    <li> Works fine but the Hair &amp; beard heads keep falling off.  The catch isn&#x27;t holding them on like it should.</li>
    <li> worked well for a while, about 6 months. then the battery just died out for no reason at all. wont recharge and cant be fixed. and yes, those plastic attchments are very flimsy. frankly i would recomend an alternate product.</li>
    <li> Great product. No issues, great battery life. No problems so far, If out of battery, u can plug and still use.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a present for my husband and he is very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;It grooms better than any he had before.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he liked it enough. Then one day, it stopped charging; it&#x27;s dead and there&#x27;s no returning it. Buyers beware.</li>
    <li> It is a nice machine.&lt;br /&gt;It is not heavy, so it good to trim without holding a heavy stuff in your hands.&lt;br /&gt;But it could be easier to clean and more trim sizes for the beard.</li>
    <li> Words very well for an affordable trimmer. I have only used for facial and body and it works great with no pinching of skin like some cheap buzzers do.</li>
    <li> The thing I like the most about this product is the great battery life. it also has alot of attachments, that I can point out all do what they are intended to. It looks sleek and light therefore great for travel or home use. The price in comparison to other competing products is really good. I liked it so much that I purchased one for my uncle and he seems to be happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> Completely dead and won&#x27;t charge after a single use.  I don&#x27;t have the receipt and I don&#x27;t want to hassle with the process of sending it back to Norelco, so they basically robbed me of $30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  Changed my review from 1 to 3 stars after chatting online with a representative and going through a fairly easy process to get it replaced.  Hopefully the next one works better.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty decent product when it works. Solid feeling, great battery life and plenty of attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after about a year it stopped working. I replaced the battery but apparently that wasn&#x27;t what was broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look elsewhere if you want a product that lasts!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great little trimmer.  It holds a charge for forever.  I can trim my line easily and close.  I can trim my hair easily.  It also has the the attachment for trimming the nose and ear hairs.  I&#x27;m very happy I bought this.</li>
    <li> The product was really nice amazon did a awesome job with the package as always. First off when I Unboxed it the product comes with multiple clips to shave every nook and cranny on your face. I dont have much facial hair so, i only use a few of the clips it comes with. It is a fantastic product from norelco, i would buy again if needed too.</li>
    <li> This is a nice little trimmer.  We don&#x27;t cut anyone&#x27;s head hair with it (the girls would not like that!), but it is used as a mustache trimmer, and well, sometimes my hubby likes to keep his armpits and other areas trimmed down, yeah, I said it.  So for all those fine uses, it works like a champ, has lasted over a year and keeps on charging and running.  I don&#x27;t see how clippers could really differ that much from each other.  As for the accessories, they have been misplaced and not missed, but for people that use it to clip head hair, I could see that they may be more important.  I would definitely buy this one again as it is durable and completes the job that it is wanted for.</li>
    <li> This comes with a lot of accessories and holds its charge forever! I dont know if I got the lowest price but it was worth it nonetheless.</li>
    <li> I broke my razor awhile back.&lt;br /&gt;It was a pain in the hind-quarters, that couldn&#x27;t be used while it was charging.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell you how many times it cut out on me halfway through a shave and left me looking like a circus freak on my way out of the house because it needed to charge, and the son of a lawn-mower wouldn&#x27;t let me finish because its electricity addiction came first.&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m not going to say I broke it on purpose, but I&#x27;m also not going to say I broke it on accident.&lt;br /&gt;What I will say is; I needed a replacement, as I looked like Cousin It.&lt;br /&gt;So I jumped on this when I saw it in my Vine newsletter.&lt;br /&gt;I said to myself, \\&quot;I don&#x27;t have to look like the Wild Man of Borneo?! Sweet\\&quot;!!&lt;br /&gt;I like my facial hair to have that 5 o&#x27;clock shadow a day or two after shaving, and this baby gives me just that.&lt;br /&gt;It gives a close shave, as a close a shave as any electric razor, but it does so with style. Meaning;&lt;br /&gt;It has all kinds of attachments.&lt;br /&gt;Attachments for precision.&lt;br /&gt;Attachments for a wider shave.&lt;br /&gt;Attachments for length.&lt;br /&gt;You can even turn your face into a topiary if you&#x27;re feeling psychotically adventurous.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s even an attachment to shave you nose hair.&lt;br /&gt;At least I think that&#x27;s what that circular attachment that I&#x27;ve been jamming into my nostril is for.&lt;br /&gt;Point is there are attachments to shave any part of your body, should you choose to shave it.&lt;br /&gt;Which brings me to my next point, and the reason for my review title.&lt;br /&gt;I accidentally broke my wife&#x27;s Bliss feminine razor.&lt;br /&gt;Not on my face mind you.&lt;br /&gt;On the floor.&lt;br /&gt;On accident this time.&lt;br /&gt;Since she no longer had a feminine razor, her action of recourse was to use my Philips Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m not saying that this was its intended purpose, but she claims it works better than her much more expensive Bliss razor.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I needed to buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;Then the only problem was getting them mixed up.&lt;br /&gt;So mine has a happy face on it, because this product makes me happy.&lt;br /&gt;And the best part is it still works while charging!!appy face on it, because this product makes me happy.&lt;br /&gt;And the best part is it still works while charging!!</li>
    <li> My husband loves his multigroom Pro.  It is small and not bulky and heavy and works great.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This shaver gives you exactly what you&#x27;re looking for and is inexpensive. It is reliable, strong, and has a long battery life. It&#x27;s only downside is that it it a bit noisy.</li>
    <li> Over the last two years I have gone through FOUR of this product. It breaks very easily due to faulty wiring and cheap production. All three so far have broken due to faulty production as opposed to user error. I will explain:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First product: One day this unit randomly stopped charging. I ordered a replacement wall charger in case that was the problem, but it was not. The customer service people would not even allow me to try a new wall charger for free. I had to pay $20 for a new one. When the new charger did not work, I sent this one back to the manufacturer for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second product: When the second unit arrived it was broken right out of the box. This particular unit had a production flaw and left off an entire piece of the groomer! Literally, an entire piece of the plastic structure of the unit was not assembled or included. It was just missing. Clearly this slipped through the quality assurance on the assembly line. Once again, I contacted the manufacturer for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third product: When the third product arrived, it worked fine for two weeks. Then, one day the unit would not turn off! It just stayed activated until the battery drained out no matter what you did. The on/off switch worked, but the unit would not deactivate. Clearly the wiring was faulty in the switch. Once again, I contacted the manufacturer, but this time they yelled at me. I had to demand to speak to a manager before they would send a new product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now on the fourth product. However, none of these issues were caused by me. I have never dropped any of the devices or handled them roughly. I live alone so I know that no one elses uses it. This is just a very cheaply made product that breaks very easily, despite being priced at $40, this is a $15 product at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I buy this item and both times it broke with the same issue: the switch gets stuck and there is no way to turn it off until the battery dies.</li>
    <li> It does what it suppose to do when I need to do it. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> its buy far best product in lower range product...as specially compare to $15 norelco multigroom kit...it gets charged in only 50 minutes...GREAT PRODUCT TO BUY just $10 more but totally worth it...</li>
    <li> I have always used the cheap G370 Philips Norelco and loved it. I wanted to upgrade to this one assuming that it would work exactly the same but have better battery life and work while charging. Well that was true, but the blades do not cut nearly as well. This thing really pulled on my hair. I sent it back immediately and bought another G370.</li>
    <li> I have an inexpensive trimmer  with spacers and such that I use to trim and thin my beard and mustache. I was hoping that this one would be better but it was not.  While this one looks like it might be well made it lacks the accessories/spacers and attachments to make it useful.  I like the stand/organizer that my current trimmer has while this trimmer and parts just rattle around in a bag. I was disapointed and soon gave up using this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made little thing. Not nearly as good as my old one that died. It works, but I prefer my old one.</li>
    <li> Short review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so particular about my beard.  I like to change things up pretty frequently.  I also like to cut my own hair.  Finally, after using several other makes and models, I&#x27;ve found this great Philips Norelco multigroomer.  It&#x27;s actually what I need for BOTH beard and hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts forever&lt;br /&gt;attachments are exactly what I need for varying beard lengths, hair lengths, and nose hair removal&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be sticking with this one for a while.</li>
    <li> I because very frustrated with 3 other models before I finally, luckily, found this one. I could never find a good trimmer that lasted very long off a charge. Every time I went to use my other models they were dead or dying. That is no longer a problem with this Philips Norelco unit. Not once has it run out of power on me. In fact, I only plug it in because I&#x27;m afraid that it&#x27;s actually creating power out of nothing, and I don&#x27;t want to create a black hole in my bathroom. I HIGHLY recommend this unit!</li>
    <li> I bought this razor at Target to replace an old one, and I am shocked at how well this razor trims my beard. It makes short work of a trim up and cuts hair evenly without having to go over the same spot repeatedly. The attachments work very well. The only gripe I have is that it took a couple uses to nail down how to move the guide- I kept removing the entire head. Aside from that, this razor is a huge improvement over my last one, definitely worth the price, and I would absolutely buy this razor again.</li>
    <li> This works great and for long times before needing charging again. I still use this weekly and still love it. Having all the attachments is a huge benefit. The battery has lasted without issue for well over a year now. The bag it comes with is some shady quality though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: The 4 star (Instead of 5) comes from the fact that some of the blade guards that came with it had sharp edges that cut the crap out of me. A fingernail file fixed this issue.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item in June 2012 as a multi-purpose shaver.  Maybe I used the shaver once a week.  The construction is a little cheap but I expected that for the price.  I did expect the razor to last at least a year; however, the razor stopped holding a charge last week.</li>
    <li> At first look seems cheap.after using, fills comfortable in hands.motor strong.and i like the way combs slide on. has a slight control lock cut settings for steady trimmings.i always used philips norelco in the pass.easy on the face.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product I ever had. I have previously bought few items like this but never satisfied......This is really great...absolutely great product....</li>
    <li> This surpassed all my expectations. It is like the professional razor they use at salons but also has trimming tools, I use this for everything.</li>
    <li> Update:&lt;br /&gt;It has almost been a year since I posted the original review. I want to add, that the only time I have had to charge this trimmer is the initial charge when I first received it. I only use it once, maybe twice a month, but for the charge to hold this longs is tremendous. It is still going strong with no signs of needing a recharge in the near future. I highly recommend this trimmer. I have never seen one hold a charge like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had several trimmers over the years. What drew my attention to this one was the battery and the quick charge. This trimmer is very powerful, and is great for trimming the beard.</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed this product. With the different interchangeable heads it makes using the razor great.  Would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> This hair groomer for the face and head is inexpensive and good value for money. Its accessories all work effectively on a wide range of hair lengths.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: really comprehensive accessory kit; universal charger; lightweight; LiIon battery; charging time; battery endurance.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Concerns about travelling - the container is not something to throw in your bag &amp; go, and available protection for delicate parts is minimal/inadequate. In use its light weight counts against it a bit, so it takes more time to do the job - however, that is less important than the travelling advantages of low weight and size.&lt;br /&gt;Other:My hair is fair and thin so I can&#x27;t say how it will go with a dark heavy beard.</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper to cut my hair. It does not work on head hair at all. It did work on facial hair,but thats it. Disapointed!!!</li>
    <li> Battery lasts a long time, plenty of different attachments. Works well.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best trimmer i have owned. I have owned many different trimmers and this one is just amazing. It charges incredibly fast, there are many attachments, and the main shavers are super sharp and crisp. It is so smooth and strong. It&#x27;s exactly what I was expecting from Norelco and it is amazing.</li>
    <li> My husband tried a few different trimmers and was dissatisfied with them.  He loves this because it trims his beard and the smaller attachments allow him to trim his mustache closely..</li>
    <li> Picked this up at Target yesterday and its going back today.  Absolutely useless, none of the molded plastic attachments hold their settings, the beard trimmer can&#x27;t get a tight fade and the instructions are labored mishmash.  Makes you wonder if Norelco ever previews the product they try to put on the consumer.  Getting the box open was the first signal this was a lemon.  Yuck...I can still taste it.</li>
    <li> Product trims the beard nice. However the head attachments do not stay attached due to cheap and crappy plastic construction of the unit.</li>
    <li> I bought these hoping they would be quality- the interchangeable blades detach very easily and often fall off when applying even a light amount of pressure. The plastic clip to adjust the blade size is also very hard to swap. Overall, this gets the job done but I would spend my money on shaver is better quality</li>
    <li> This is the best grooming set I&#x27;ve ever used thanks to the li-ion battery. Going on a year now of daily/weekly use and the battery life has not noticeably decreased. None of my guards have broken and the performance of the unit has not degraded at all. For the price I could not have asked for more.</li>
    <li> PROS&lt;br /&gt;- battery life great&lt;br /&gt;- washable blades great&lt;br /&gt;- guarantee great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- loud&lt;br /&gt;- not enough adjustments for closer length trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some 30+ lengths but most are beard/hair length.  There&#x27;s just not enough adjustments for close gradation of facial hair.  I&#x27;ll have to get used to angling the blade to achieve different lengths of closeness, because the jump from closest shave to the next close length is way too far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fault though, for not taking a closer look.  I was hoping for something more like my old Conair where you could actually adjust the blade depth in millimeter increments.</li>
    <li> I had this product for a little over 6 weeks, using it once or twice a week. It was working pretty well until today. The whole thing has just crapped out. It won&#x27;t charge, the indicator light won&#x27;t come on, and there&#x27;s nothing I can do. No help from Philips or Amazon on this one.&lt;br /&gt;Your call on whether you want to risk it...</li>
    <li> After being the owner of a Philips Norelco Cool Skin shaver for the last 7 years (which still works perfectly), a year ago I decided to get one of these. Light, easy to carry and quick to charge, worked fine for about 4 months and then it suddenly stopped working. The unit was able to charge but it wouldn&#x27;t work. I got in touch with Customer Service and they promptly sent me a replacement unit which I&#x27;ve been using since, but today that one died as well. It&#x27;s stuck with the led lit up in orange and won&#x27;t work at all. I contacted CS again and they offered to send me a new replacement, but honestly I&#x27;m not gonna wait for it to arrive. I&#x27;m never getting another Philips product again, very poor quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for over 1 month. So far it is operating strong and trimming well. My major complaint is that Philips Norelco could not spend the extra $.50 to provide a stand to hold the trimmer pieces that fits in a medicine cabinet. Rather, I have to dig through the pouch they provide every time I use the trimmer to find the attachments that I am looking for. It&#x27;s a major inconvenience. I have an older and cheaper Norelco trimmer that does have such a stand. I don&#x27;t understand why they couldn&#x27;t provide a stand with this model.</li>
