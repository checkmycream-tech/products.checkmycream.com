<li> Just spray a little on your face to set your make or just to feel refreshed.</li>
<li> My little one loves it when I spray his face.</li>
<li> and I even use it at home when my make up looks a little too cakey.</li>
<li> You receive it together in just a few days.</li>
<li> Looking forward to trying it on my toddler for his delicate cheeks as other reviewers have suggested!</li>
<li> and I keep the small can in my purse</li>
<li> I received a small 5oz travel bottle that I always keep in my purse.</li>
<li> I use it everyday to wake me up and also after my makeup to set it!</li>
<li> I carry a small btl in my purse at all times.</li>
<li> At least not in my area.</li>
<li> Too bad I can&#x27;t find in stores any longer...</li>
<li> After applying base, eye make-up and blush</li>

    <li> Love this! So refreshing</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so well liked I&#x27;ve had people steal it. Great to have on hot days, especially when it&#x27;s been chilled.</li>
    <li> this stuff is nice on hot days or to use when dampening your face to apply a clay mask. its definitely not good for setting makeup, maybe for giving a dewy finish to your skin (i prefer a matte finish having oily skin) but thats it really. i probably could have put purified water in a spray bottle but thats ok, its still nice to have around</li>
    <li> Discovered these in the sweltering Alabama summer and they are amazing! I have combination skin and a spritz now and then gives me a glowing finish without looking oily. Perfect for dry winters too. They&#x27;re pricey for being just water, but the results are worth it. Looking forward to trying it on my toddler for his delicate cheeks as other reviewers have suggested!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so nice. I&#x27;ve bought 3 bottles, one for my computer desk, one in the bathroom, and one in my purse. I use it about 2-3 times a day and it really does keep my skin soft and refreshed without being slathered in some greasy lotion.</li>
    <li> One for the purse one for home or travel....&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for hot days or personal summer days.&lt;br /&gt;Nice mist to cool off with.</li>
    <li> Product is great for that mist needed to rejuvenate the skin.  It is light and amazingly hard to find elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This spray water is awesome. Just spray a little on your face to set your make or just to feel refreshed. It&#x27;s invigorating! My little one loves it when I spray his face. I carry a small btl in my purse at all times.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews about the Evian spray on Sephora and Ulta.  I knew I had to try it and am so glad I did!!  This spray is very refreshing and makes my skin feel good.  I like the way it makes my makeup feel set too.  I will be a regular user of Avian Facial Spray.</li>
    <li> This is something I need daily! My skin is very senstive and dry.  This helps my face hydrate and leaves my skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use 3 products for my facial dry skin.  1. Aloe Vera Gel 2. Collagent Essence Facial Mask Cucumber 3. Evian Facial Water spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All 3 works very well on my skin.  It got my skin feeling very soft and clean!!</li>
    <li> Great as a toner. Really refreshes your skin. If you want the purest water and facial spray, then buy Evian. Nice to use when traveling.</li>
    <li> This spray is sooo amazing, especially when the weather is really hot. You can use under makeup before moisturizer and even over makeup. It keeps your skin very hydrated :o)</li>
    <li> Love it ! It works betterthan the MAC brand , and great price ! Def would buy again in the future</li>

    <li> Hard to find this all time favorite of mine! I use it when I feel hot, flushed, to set my makeup, or to just get a spritz of feeling wonderful! Too bad I can&#x27;t find in stores any longer...I wonder why not. At least not in my area.</li>
    <li> I have been using Evian facial spray for 7 years now and I love it! I use it everyday to wake me up and also after my makeup to set it! I also keep a travel size in my purse to freshen my face on the go after a long day. I highly recommend!</li>
