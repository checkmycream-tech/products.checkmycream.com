      <li>I didn&#x27;t buy pure cocoa butter or shea since he&#x27;s so picky with scents</li>

    <li> super thick cream that worked greatly for winter  ,i hope they still will be good to use at this fall .</li>
    <li> I bought this product while pregnant hoping to eliminate stretch marks. Luckily I never got any stretch marks. I am not sure I can say that it&#x27;s 100% because of this product since I used it about once a week. The coco butter is smooth and rubs on well. It did a great job of re hydrating my always dry legs. It does have the strong coco butter smell to it so make sure you are not putting it on before you head out the door. It was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS STUFF! Smaller tub is great for travel.</li>
    <li> A little too greasy for my taste.</li>
    <li> Leaves me greasy and while the initial smell is pleasant, it ends up making me stink after awhile.  I do not like this.</li>
    <li> great product, feels wonderful on my skin</li>
    <li> Bought this product for complete body treatment. Must really help. My healthcare giver had reason to touch my leg and couldn&#x27;t believe how remarkedly soft my skin is. I like the soothing feeling it leaves on my hands. (I&#x27;m 74 and am mistaken for 50ish.)</li>
    <li> I was really happy with this product until Amazon increased the price.  Now I buy a large bottle of lotion for the same price.</li>
    <li> I love how his makes my skin feel, just wish the scent was a little weaker&lt;br /&gt;very chocolatey, but I knew that when I purchased it&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy this product especially after beating my hands up working&lt;br /&gt;it brings some ver nice relief and a little goes a long way so the jar will last me a while</li>
    <li> The product description deceptively stated, &amp;#34;Our products are inspired by nature’s finest ingredients because they are safer, and often more effective, than harsh chemicals and unnecessary additives. We use natural elements like cocoa butter that are rich with vitamins and natural emollient properties to moisturize, soften and nurture your skin and hair&amp;#34;. When it arrived, the ingredients list contained few natural sounding ingredients. The list was Paraffinum Liquidum, Aqua, Beeswax, Paraffin, Theobroma Cacao Seed Butter, Sodium Borate, Lanolin, Stearyl Alcohol, Fragrance, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Red 33, and Red 40.</li>
    <li> love this lotion.  I have super dry hands and this helps within a few applications.  Smell is great, product is non greasy and non irritating. would buy again</li>
    <li> fast absorbing hand cream.but it has petrolium in ingredients but still I love it</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Only complaint is that it does seem a little greasy, not the best for your face. Works great though regardless of the area you apply it to!</li>
    <li> My skin is super dry. Lotions, oils creams don&#x27;t really help my skin at all but this stuff is excellent. I love this stuff during the winter time. I&#x27;ll take a nice shower and towel pat my skin and slather a lot on. It&#x27;s very think more of a body butter consistency and creamy but easy to rub into skin. It definately leaves a greasy feel to the skin which I don&#x27;t mind whatsoever b/c my skin is soo dry.  As far of the smell it has some sort of a coconut scent but I don&#x27;t mind it cuz I use it at night after shower. This is my second tub and will continue to buy it it also repairs the skin and relieves any itching. Try it u won&#x27;t regret it !!!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even believe how amazing this stuff is.  I have been searching for a cream that would hydrate my very dry 40+ year old skin for years, trying $$ brands and everything else in between, and this is IT! It even softens my dry, scaly feet.  I put it on my face at night and wake up with super soft, beautiful skin; it is the only cream that makes the wrinkles under my eyes almost non-existent.  And it&#x27;s CHEAP!  I can&#x27;t wait to get the body lotion.  Try this; you will not be sorry!</li>
    <li> I had no idea what to expect from this  when i bought it and I still don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s too oily for my liking but works nicely on my dry cracked heels, knees and elbows. I threw some in my melt and pour soap and it added a bit of moisturizing power to it.&lt;br /&gt;I still don&#x27;t remember what in the world I wanted to use this for.</li>
    <li> this cocoa butter cr&amp;egrave;me does wonders to my dry legs. This is my second time around. I di not purchase the first on from Amazon, but if I didn&#x27;t like it, I would not have come looking for it at Amazon. The price was right. Go ahead and purchase it.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. It makes my skin soft, cocoa butter is one of my favorite body creams. Thats all o have to say.</li>
    <li> My skin is in heaven.  It&#x27;s not greasy, soaks into the skin quickly and soothes my hands in minutes.</li>
    <li> love queen helena cocoa butter hand and body cream.it is non greasy and fast absobent.though it ha petrolium in it ,I always prefar to use it on my hands and not on my face.</li>
    <li> This tiny jar does wonders! My son always walks around looking like snow itself. Other lotions and cremes dry out easily on his skin. This one lasts. I didn&#x27;t buy pure cocoa butter or shea since he&#x27;s so picky with scents so this was a good alternative for us.</li>
    <li> My grandma loves this cream for her face. I tried it and broke out. So not for my face BUT I use it on my thighs and upper arms because of &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; (tiny dry bumps) and after using it you can barely feel/see it! Awesome!!! This cream doesn&#x27;t moisturize too well but makes skin very soft. :)</li>
    <li> I use this skin cream on my skin after showering, and it really makes my skin soft.  I try to pay extra attention to my knees and elbows because they can be very dry.  It&#x27;s a little oily, but that is what I need because my skin is very dry.</li>
    <li> I was assuming this was bigger. I am so disappointed, very small. The description should say travel size because that&#x27;s what it is. I wanted the bigger size and this size does not worth the money . I should have paid more attention to the size not thinking.</li>
    <li> Queen Helene coca butter is the most moisturizing body creme I have ever used.  I have had zero side effects from using this creme ( no rashes, redness, etc.)  I really like using this for the winter when my elbows dry out and it cures that problem almost immediately!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend especially if you have severely dry skin (elbows or feet).  It rubs on easily and dries smooth.  Very nice creme!</li>
