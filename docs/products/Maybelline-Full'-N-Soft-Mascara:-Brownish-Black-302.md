### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and I am very happy with the way it works.  </li>
      <li>This is the greatest mascara formula I have ever tried - because of this, I&#x27;ve been hooked for over 10 years.</li>
      <li>I am always on the lookout for the best mascara out there</li>

      <li>Great application and</li>
      <li>:o)</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s perfect :)</li>
      <li>But if I dont have to go through the pain of flakes and clumps in my contacts I&#x27;m good with this</li>
      <li>Was delighted I found I could order it on-line and have it delivered to my door.</li>
      <li>And I could never find a mascara that gave good lash coverage without the clumps.</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s not as good as I remembered.</li>
      <li>it works as good as a highend waterproof mascara.  </li>
      <li>I recommend it to people all the time, and everyone I know that has tried it has loved it.</li>
      <li>Really a great mascara - never clumps, perfect for sensitive eyes, lots of volume and length.</li>
      <li>Best of all it&#x27;s really affordable!</li>
      <li>Seems to apply nicely and stay on without flaking.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for sometime and really liked it.  </li>
      <li>This is one produce that is true to its advertisement, and a great color as well.</li>
      <li>I was happy to find out that Maybelline Full</li>
      <li>It does not clump and best of all I still look natural.</li>
      <li>Very pleased to find this shade of my favorite mascara, since the stores aren&#x27;t carrying it any more.</li>
      <li>This is discontinued and I hadn&#x27;t been able to find a suitable replacement.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara because it&#x27;s affordable and darkens your lashes without thickening them.  </li>
      <li>The mascara is okay.</li>
      <li>Glad I was able to find this on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara and have been using it for years.  </li>
      <li>This, of course, should make mascara clump more, and most mascara does.</li>
      <li>my favorite mascara I have found.</li>
      <li>Have always been more satisfied with Maybelline over any mascara out there.</li>
      <li>what i love most is</li>
      <li>The price on Amazon is much better that what you&#x27;ll find elsewhere - even at Walmart.  </li>
      <li>, I am SO IN LOVE WITH IT</li>
      <li>my lashes look better by using both lash blast</li>
      <li>I had just purchased $22 dollar mascara by Benefit and like the Mabelline better.</li>
      <li>My all time favorite mascara.</li>
      <li>I feel there should be better quality control</li>
      <li>The best way I can describe it is that Full &#x27;N Soft tends to make your eyes look &#x27;</li>
      <li>Wouldn&#x27;t you know that Maybelline would go ahead and discontinue this excellent product after it&#x27;s been one of the tried-and-true favorites of so many people for so long!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time, gas and money running from store to store to purchase what many said is the best no-flake, no-glob mascara.  </li>
      <li>It makes my lashes very full, and never crunchy.</li>
      <li>I love the brush, this mascara goes on smooth every time</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find this mascara in the brownish-black in any local stores, so I love the great price I get it for on Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>Its easy to apply, easy to remove and gets every lash with ease.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to remove with eye makeup remover.</li>
      <li>But I tried the new Cover Girl Full lash Bloom and it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive and goes on so smooth and easy without having to coat and coat and coat.</li>
      <li>i love this mascara, the brush and consistency work perfectly together to give a feathery fan of darkened lashes without looking like you obviously have mascara on, which when working in a professional setting is really important.  </li>
      <li>very pleased, love this mascara, it is as the name says Full &amp; Soft.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t give volume, and I have daughters that have the long beautiful eyelashes, which I am jealous of.</li>
      <li>If building, I recommend using a clean mascara brush to separate between coats.</li>
      <li>It is great in a single coat and also builds well.</li>
      <li>It lengthens and separates so there&#x27;s no clumps, just natural looking eye lashes, love it!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s hands down the most natural, non fake-looking mascara in the best brownish-black color that&#x27;s still within the inexpensive price range.</li>
      <li>Maybelline Full</li>
      <li>Without mascara I look like I don&#x27;t have any lashes at all, but with the Maybelline Full</li>
      <li>I cannot say enough good things about this mascara.</li>
      <li>and I always get nice, soft looking lashes.</li>
      <li>It cleaned up quickly and I continued applying.</li>
      <li>It was shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>The only thing that I think could make this product better would be a curling brush to give the lashes a bit more lift.  </li>
      <li>As far as drugstore mascaras go, I have loved Full N Soft for years.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried both the regular and the waterproof versions of this mascara; I prefer the latter, as it stays on great yet washes off easily.  </li>
      <li>This is totally different from brown mascaras that I think only work for very fair blond people.</li>
      <li>Bought this on a whim to see if I would like it better than my old standby.</li>
      <li>probably not intense enough for night looks, but for day to day this is perfect.</li>
      <li>More for the enhanced, defined natural look rather than vavavoom.</li>
      <li>But light or dark, no clumps with this winning product!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Full &#x27;N Soft in the non-waterproof version for many many years simply because to me</li>
      <li>It keeps my lashes up and thickens them the right amount.</li>
      <li>you want the flare at the corners,use your hand just right and angle the brush.</li>
      <li>product works good, is easy to use, last long.</li>
      <li>and this one is less then $7 and works just as good as the department store brand.</li>
      <li>Eh...I expected this to be amazing mascara...</li>
      <li>Great mascara, doesn&#x27;t clump, flake or get thick in the tube.  </li>
      <li>I like it pretty well.</li>
      <li>Well, I just cant speak well enough about this magic product</li>
      <li>I have tried many kinds and I always come back to this one.</li>
      <li>I have been using this mascara ever since it first came out.</li>
      <li>so was very pleased to see that I could order the brownish black.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara, but this particular time it is gloppy :o</li>
      <li>I love the Mascara because it is soft on the lashes and looks so natural.  </li>
      <li>It is exactly identical to the Maybelline Full N Soft Mascara that they sell in every drug store, but this one was a lot cheaper.</li>
      <li>Lashes are full, they are not stiff or clumpy.  </li>
      <li>I always use Full N Soft mascara, but I didn&#x27;t realize this is not the washable waterproof.</li>
      <li>The Full&#x27;N&#x27;Soft has vitamin E in it, which helps moisturize the eyelashes...making them fuller,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always prefered Maybelline for mascaras over any other brand, but this particular kind isn&#x27;t my style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend to anyone who knows what they want and wants to save money as well!</li>
      <li>Delivery was very prompt, too.</li>
      <li>Why does this product cost so much?</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This has to be one of the best mascaras I have ever tried (and I&#x27;ve tried many!).  My lashes are both thin and short, and I&#x27;ve found that this mascara adds plenty of fullness AND a bit of length, too.  Plus, there are absolutely NO CLUMPS when I use this mascara; the unique brush deposits just the right amount of product on my lashes, unlike other products that claim to be \\&quot;clump-free.\\&quot;  I&#x27;ve tried both the regular and the waterproof versions of this mascara; I prefer the latter, as it stays on great yet washes off easily.  The only thing that I think could make this product better would be a curling brush to give the lashes a bit more lift.  Although Full &#x27;N Soft isn&#x27;t a dramatic mascara, it is perfect for everyday wear, and I would recommend highly to anyone.</li>
    <li> The mascara is okay.The brush is too thick.I exchange it by using the brush from the Great Lash brand.Have always been more satisfied with Maybelline over any mascara out there.</li>
    <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t bothered to go to three or four different stores looking fruitlessly for this product----my lifelong favorite.  I ordered 4 at once, and even including shipping costs, I ended up paying substantially less than I would have paid at the store if they ever had my color!  Delivery was very prompt, too.</li>
    <li> This mascara is the best!! I can only find the &#x27;very black&#x27; in the stores so was very pleased to see that I could order the brownish black.</li>
    <li> I had read great reviewa and thought I would try this and I am very happy with the way it works.  I had just purchased $22 dollar mascara by Benefit and like the Mabelline better.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to mascara. I have tried many kinds and I always come back to this one. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it! My lashes are long but thin, and this actually gives me volume. It never clumps for me and I always get nice, soft looking lashes. Sadly I can never find the color I&#x27;m looking for in stores, so now I order off Amazon and it&#x27;s perfect :)</li>
    <li> Local drugstore in my area charges 7.99 but since I&#x27;m an Amazon prime member I get it deliver to my door within two days w/o shipping and handling fee and only pay 4.00.    I&#x27;ve been using this masca for over five years now and sometimes I&#x27;m afraid that this might be discontinued so I  always pick up few more than I need at a time. Great application and it works as good as a highend waterproof mascara.  I highly recommend this mascara.</li>
    <li> This is discontinued and I hadn&#x27;t been able to find a suitable replacement. But I tried the new Cover Girl Full lash Bloom and it&#x27;s great. Comes in brown-black, stays soft and stays on till the end of day. My only complaint is that the brush feels rough as you apply and that&#x27;s a little unpleasant. But I&#x27;m really hoping my eyelashes will now grown back in after being abused by other mascaras that for hard and clumpy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mascara ever since it first came out. I tried several dozen other mascara both popular brands and high-end. And I could never find a mascara that gave good lash coverage without the clumps. This mascara allows you to either create a completely natural (but beautiful look), or add an extra layer or two for a dramatic, almost fake lash look. Without mascara I look like I don&#x27;t have any lashes at all, but with the Maybelline Full &#x27;N Soft on I get compliments on my eyes and sometimes even get asked where I buy my lashes! What a difference!! Plus another BIG benefit of this mascara is that it comes in a \\&quot;brownish-black\\&quot; color, which looks black on but doesnt look awkward and fake. This is totally different from brown mascaras that I think only work for very fair blond people. I have hazel eyes  and dark hair, this brownish black looks incredible on my eyes. Well, I just cant speak well enough about this magic product, I am SO IN LOVE WITH IT I don&#x27;t know what I would ever do without it!!</li>
    <li> I ended up not even opening the packaging; I could tell by the look of them they had to be pretty old; one was actually very yellowed and they both looked like they&#x27;d come from a discount sales bin somewhere. I looked up the product codes from the bottom of the tubes and learned that they had been produced in 2005 and 2007, respectively. This is clearly well past the \\&quot;safe\\&quot; three-year shelf life. Now I have to return them in the hopes of getting my $20 refunded. This company should not be allowed to sell on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Third-party seller (BeautyTime) claims the product \\&quot;never expires\\&quot; (contrary to Maybelline&#x27;s website, even), and has accused me of lying and that the product \\&quot;didn&#x27;t exist in 2005 &amp; 2007,\\&quot; which is not true (I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for YEARS). I have ordered this mascara on Amazon before, and not had this same experience. Be careful as to who the third-party seller is. This company is clearly shady.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.  I had a few dollars left on a gift card so purchased this item.  I&#x27;m not sure if it might be old or not but it appeared to be pretty dried out.</li>
    <li> After trying every type and brand of mascara on the market, I finally asked my filmmaker daughter what she used. Her eyelashes always looked beautiful - never a clump. She told me about Full N Soft, and I found it hidden at the bottom of the shelves in my local RiteAid drug store. I would love to buy every tube available, but, alas, mascara gets old and my eyes know it. So I will keep on hoping Maybelline never discontinues this. The brownish black came from China, I think; I cannot find it in California. I wish Maybelline would put this lighter than black color on the market again. Also, other colors. As you get older you need to use a lighter mascara. But light or dark, no clumps with this winning product!</li>
    <li> As these have finally run out after being discontinued, they come to you now dry</li>
    <li> I am always on the lookout for the best mascara out there and this one is it! It&#x27;s inexpensive and goes on so smooth and easy without having to coat and coat and coat.</li>
    <li> Very pleased to find this shade of my favorite mascara, since the stores aren&#x27;t carrying it any more. BUT, had to stop using it because my eyes began burning only a few hours into the day-actually had to wash it off to stop the burning. This used to happen when mascara was getting old, so can only assume the ordered product was already old. I&#x27;ve thrown out this mascara and found another product to buy. So disappointed.</li>
    <li> Brush is much better for application than other types and brands of mascara.</li>
    <li> TERRIBLE PRODUCT!  Ordered Maybelline Full &#x27;n Soft Mascara brownish black that was listed on DEC 5th as an &amp;#34;add on item&amp;#34;, sold by Maybelline.  Received this product on DEC 13th via USPS (not with my additional beauty products purchased that day from Amazon via UPS).  When I opened the mailing package, it was obvious this was an older tube of mascara as the backing of the package had become yellow in color.  Upon opening, I unscrewed the cap and when I tried to bring the brush out of the tube its was VERY slow and sludge like.  VERY BAD for any product - especially one that is made to be applied to the eye area.  Called Amazon and was told that Amazon would contact the seller (which turned out to be A2ZLiquidators - NOT Maybelline, NOT Amazon.  Now I must wait to see if this seller will return my $7.10.  Their policy is no returns for open packages --  how is the buyer to know if item is defective (in this case old and sludge like) unless you open it.  NOT HAPPY with this &amp;#34;bait and switch&amp;#34; kinda deal with the supplier.  Would NEVER knowingly purchase makeup from a &amp;#34;liquidator&amp;#34; - Amazon made the choice to go to this supplier in order to fulfill this order, not me.  Amazon should eat the $7.10 cost - NOT the Prime customer.  No more make up from Amazon for me.</li>
    <li> Maybelline Full&#x27; N Soft Mascara: Brownish Black #302&lt;br /&gt;This product works good, is easy to use, last long. I would purchase this item again&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> It is really hard to fins this mascara in any stores in brownish black, so I was happy to find it on Amazon. This mascara works well, is non-irritating, and it is a great daytime color.</li>
    <li> Nothing against the seller because the package was sealed but the mascara must be old. Or doesn&#x27;t take long for it to start flaking off after application. I have used the exact same product for at least five years or more and never had this issue.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara....perfect for casual wear. Unfortunately they must not be making it any more! Glad I was able to find this on Amazon. It was shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> This is probably a personal preference on mascara, because it&#x27;s not a bad mascara. I just find I prefer a thicker, heavier mascara. I&#x27;ve always prefered Maybelline for mascaras over any other brand, but this particular kind isn&#x27;t my style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is big and bushy, which leaves the lashes very clean of any extra mascara. As a result, you get a light and subtle look.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time, gas and money running from store to store to purchase what many said is the best no-flake, no-glob mascara.  I&#x27;ve bought expensive mascara from \\&quot;big name mall stores,\\&quot; inexpensive mascara and all those in between.  I was happy to find out that Maybelline Full &#x27;N Soft Mascara did not flake!  While applying I have had a couple of issues with a lot of mascara coming out on my lashes all at once.  No big deal.  It cleaned up quickly and I continued applying. Best of all it&#x27;s really affordable! I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this mascara.</li>
    <li> Great mascara, doesn&#x27;t clump, flake or get thick in the tube.  I am sorry the brownish black has been discontinued at retail stores.</li>
    <li> i love this mascara, the brush and consistency work perfectly together to give a feathery fan of darkened lashes without looking like you obviously have mascara on, which when working in a professional setting is really important.  what i love most is i have to be a huge lash comb fiend with most mascaras to avoid the awful spikes look or worse, clumps. this mascara does neither, i don&#x27;t have to comb at all and i&#x27;m always in a rush so saving a another tool and step is great.  probably not intense enough for night looks, but for day to day this is perfect.</li>
    <li> Eh...I expected this to be amazing mascara...and it just wasn&#x27;t. I am sad I can&#x27;t give rave reviews for it...but I don&#x27;t feel like its that great. my lashes look better by using both lash blast and then the falsies than it does using this stuff. Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> very pleased, love this mascara, it is as the name says Full &amp; Soft. Wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara, but this particular time it is gloppy :o( Otherwise, 5 Stars! I can&#x27;t find this mascara in the brownish-black in any local stores, so I love the great price I get it for on Amazon.com. The Full&#x27;N&#x27;Soft has vitamin E in it, which helps moisturize the eyelashes...making them fuller, my favorite mascara I have found. :o)</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried.  And I&#x27;ve tried a lot.  I love the brush, this mascara goes on smooth every time and I never never never have clumps.  Not even at the end of the tube.  Lashes feel soft and look so natural!  LOVE this mascara!!!  Would highly recommend to anyone looking for something new.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite mascara. Gives Avery natural look which is what I like. NO clumps.</li>
    <li> This was actually referred to me by someone from makeupalley.com. I have been looking for a mascara that wouldn&#x27;t clump or flake because everytime it does it drops into my contacts. PAIN. I&#x27;ve gone from covergirl eyelights to other mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS is the only one that I haven&#x27;t had any issues with. I\\&quot;ve had and used it for a month now. This will definately be my go-to. It doesn&#x27;t give volume, and I have daughters that have the long beautiful eyelashes, which I am jealous of. But if I dont have to go through the pain of flakes and clumps in my contacts I&#x27;m good with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want the flare at the corners,use your hand just right and angle the brush.That would be my only complaint, it doesn&#x27;t have the curved brush. I will definately will look for the curved brush. If I can&#x27;t find it I&#x27;ll just angle the wand!</li>
    <li> Have used this for a few years and never disappoints.  More for the enhanced, defined natural look rather than vavavoom.</li>
    <li> Maybelline hasn&#x27;t failed me yet, and this mascara is no exception. I don&#x27;t wear mascara every day, but when I do, this is the one I choose. I like to look as natural as possible, and this mascara does the trick. It&#x27;s not incredibly black to the point where it&#x27;s obvious I have it on. It keeps my lashes up and thickens them the right amount. It does not clump and best of all I still look natural.</li>
    <li> This one was recommended to me when I complained about clumping from my other brand.  It doesn&#x27;t clump, and it really does go on soft, but you have to really apply a lot to see it, and the brush is very fat so allow for accidentally swiping your lid or cheek.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara and have been using it for years.  Its easy to apply, easy to remove and gets every lash with ease.  Im thinking they might be phasing this out as Im seeing it less and less.  Im taking away a star ONLY because they still are animal testing and thats just not necessary in this day and age.</li>
    <li> I really feel guilty reviewing this product because I am 68 years old and have only sparse eyelashes. This, of course, should make mascara clump more, and most mascara does. This is one produce that is true to its advertisement, and a great color as well.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past (purchased at a drug or grocery store) and never had the same experience.  Unfortunately I ordered two.  I feel there should be better quality control</li>
    <li> I always use Full N Soft mascara, but I didn&#x27;t realize this is not the washable waterproof. This is like putting black water on your eyelashes, very disappointed.</li>
    <li> i used to use this mascara years ago and decided to order it to add variety to my looks. However, it&#x27;s not as good as I remembered. I have long eye lashes naturally and this mascara doesn&#x27;t do much to add to the length, and it doesn&#x27;t do much to add to the fullness. It&#x27;s more of a natural everyday look if you like that. One big plus is it DOESN&#x27;T CLUMP. I don&#x27;t think I will order it again though, because I like more dramatic look. For overall length/fullness Maybelline&#x27;s \\&quot;falsies\\&quot; mascara is my favorite find so far.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest mascara formula I have ever tried - because of this, I&#x27;ve been hooked for over 10 years. It makes my lashes very full, and never crunchy. The price on Amazon is much better that what you&#x27;ll find elsewhere - even at Walmart.  Buy in bulk.  It will save you money down the road.</li>
    <li> I love the Mascara because it is soft on the lashes and looks so natural.  I have sensitive eyes and this mascara does not irritate my eyes.  It is easy to remove with eye makeup remover.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for sometime and really liked it.  Not long ago this product became unavailable in my area.  Was delighted I found I could order it on-line and have it delivered to my door.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good things about this mascara. I recommend it to people all the time, and everyone I know that has tried it has loved it. The only downside is that Maybelline has discontinued all colors except \\&quot;Very Black,\\&quot; so I&#x27;d stock up here while you still can. Really a great mascara - never clumps, perfect for sensitive eyes, lots of volume and length.</li>
    <li> I like it pretty well. Seems to apply nicely and stay on without flaking. The color is dark and it makes my lashes look separated.</li>
    <li> As far as drugstore mascaras go, I have loved Full N Soft for years. Drugstore mascara is inexpensive, so I have often experimented with other brands/formulas - Maybelline, Revlon, L&#x27;Oreal, etc., but Full N Soft is the one I come back to. It is great in a single coat and also builds well. If building, I recommend using a clean mascara brush to separate between coats. If during the day your lashes get bent (this happens to me with sun and prescription glasses), use your finger to apply pressure and curve lashes back in place. The flexible formula will re-mold. No flakes, no mess.&lt;br /&gt;The brownish-black is natural and minky-coloured. The super black is dramatically black!</li>
    <li> This mascara is hard to find now as its been discontinued. It lengthens and separates so there&#x27;s no clumps, just natural looking eye lashes, love it!</li>
    <li> I used to spend $20 plus on mascara&#x27;s bc I have no eyelashes, well small blond ones anyways and this one is less then $7 and works just as good as the department store brand.</li>
    <li> Used this product previously and could not find it in stores.  The color and not waterproof.  No clumping.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I found this mascara while searching through the makeup products on amazon. It is exactly identical to the Maybelline Full N Soft Mascara that they sell in every drug store, but this one was a lot cheaper. Product came in a very timely manner with no damage or problems at all. Would highly recommend to anyone who knows what they want and wants to save money as well!</li>
    <li> The shipping was great. I like the product. It stays on well through out the day and it eacy to get off at night. The only con I have is that it seems to being running out a bit quicker than other products. Would purchase again, though.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara because it&#x27;s affordable and darkens your lashes without thickening them.  It lasts roughly a month before it starts clumping like crazy.</li>
    <li> Why does this product cost so much? It is just mascara. I would like it but this is a ridiculous price. Need brownish-black and it is a great product.</li>
    <li> Bought this on a whim to see if I would like it better than my old standby. Nope. It flakes off a little and isn&#x27;t as dependable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this mascara for years and years.  Lashes are full, they are not stiff or clumpy.  To find the color brwn/blk is hard to find, but much more natural than stark black.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t you know that Maybelline would go ahead and discontinue this excellent product after it&#x27;s been one of the tried-and-true favorites of so many people for so long!  I&#x27;ve used Full &#x27;N Soft in the non-waterproof version for many many years simply because to me it&#x27;s hands down the most natural, non fake-looking mascara in the best brownish-black color that&#x27;s still within the inexpensive price range. (And, believe me, I&#x27;ve tried LOTS!) The best way I can describe it is that Full &#x27;N Soft tends to make your eyes look &#x27;pretty&#x27; without calling attention to itself and making your lashes look all coated and stiff like so many other mascaras out there do. Plus it washes off immediately with plain water when you want it to, yet doesn&#x27;t rub off during the day while you&#x27;re wearing it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this &#x27;color&#x27; in the stores.  A little expensive here at Amazon but...  I like the brush and the color.</li>
