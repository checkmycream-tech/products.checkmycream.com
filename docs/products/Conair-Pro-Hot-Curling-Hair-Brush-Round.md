### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The best brush ever!</li>
      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>Perfect!</li>
      <li>Very nice brush.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be delighted.</li>
      <li>Good quality.</li>
      <li>Love it and would recommend!</li>
      <li>I love this brush!  </li>
      <li>it was great to find them available here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Robust and nice design but pulls out quite some hair</li>
      <li>makes my new haircut look great!</li>
      <li>And the bristles of the brush are nylon ball tipped so that they are very easy on your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a nice brush with strong bristles and the handles doesn&#x27;t cramp up my hand</li>
      <li>Perfect for my mid length haircut.</li>
      <li>it was what was showing because&lt;br /&gt;i love that brush</li>
      <li>I would think Conair would have made a better &amp;#34;blow-dry styling&amp;#34</li>
      <li>It was my favorite brush.  </li>
      <li>Perfect brush for my short hair</li>
      <li>I still are my favorite brush to use</li>
      <li>Then I realize I won&#x27;t be able to get the brush out because it was too tangled up already.</li>
      <li>What I do have a knowledge on, however, is the fact that this brush is great for not only styling hair but also amazing for working out curls.  </li>
      <li>The end result was I had to cut a huge chunk of hair off</li>
      <li>The bristles feel comfortable on the scalp, and they do not scratch or prick at all.  </li>
      <li>I originally obtained one of these with a Conair hair dryer -- over 20 years ago.  </li>
      <li>It is not small but not large in size and is perfect for use with a blow dryer!  </li>
      <li>It got tangled in my hair so quick</li>
      <li>These Conair Professional Round Brushes are perfect for straightening hair during blow drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It fits just right in my hand.  </li>
      <li>and it is the right size for drying and curling my hair.  </li>
      <li>Great product........will order the small size too.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After washing my hair I use the brush to grasp my hair at the root (with the brush underneath the hair and the hair on top of brush) and while carrying the brush through my hair from root to tip, I follow above the hair with a blow dryer.</li>
      <li>and i lost so much hair trying to untangle my hair.</li>
      <li>I really like Conair products.</li>
      <li>It is also able to work out the curls that my hair tends to acquire after getting wet.  </li>
      <li>I am just very DISAPPOINTED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The original one I had of these lasted forever, but the ones they are making now just don&#x27;t last.  </li>
      <li>My hair is slightly short while still maintaining length, being around 3-5 inches long, and this brush works wonders with it; it allows me to style it easily and without much effort.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if constant use with hot air with the hair drying or hitting the floor once in a while that causes the fracture.  </li>
      <li>Tangled in hair, does not roll through easily like a round brush is supposed to.</li>
      <li>but I really need one even larger for my hair.</li>
      <li>I never have to use a flat iron (which is very damaging to your hair).</li>
      <li>First of all, I do want to say that I am a male reviewing this product, and I don&#x27;t have an extensive knowledge about hair styling.  </li>
      <li>brushes are very hard to find in stores and when I was able to find them I bought several to have as backups.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I originally obtained one of these with a Conair hair dryer -- over 20 years ago.  It was my favorite brush.  When it started to show signs of wear (about 5 years ago) I started looking for another one.  FINALLY!  If it lasts even half as long as its predecessor I&#x27;ll be delighted.</li>
    <li> First of all, I do want to say that I am a male reviewing this product, and I don&#x27;t have an extensive knowledge about hair styling.  What I do have a knowledge on, however, is the fact that this brush is great for not only styling hair but also amazing for working out curls.  The bristles feel comfortable on the scalp, and they do not scratch or prick at all.  My hair is slightly short while still maintaining length, being around 3-5 inches long, and this brush works wonders with it; it allows me to style it easily and without much effort.  It is also able to work out the curls that my hair tends to acquire after getting wet.  The \\&quot;Conair Professional Large Round Brush\\&quot; works extremely well with hair, and I wouldn&#x27;t switch it for any other brush.</li>
    <li> i thought i was getting the brush that was pictured on&lt;br /&gt;the screen but it wasnt  they sent me&lt;br /&gt;a different brush&lt;br /&gt;so i had to send it back&lt;br /&gt;wish it was what was showing because&lt;br /&gt;i love that brush</li>
    <li> Very nice brush. Good quality. I really like Conair products. I did return this brush because it was just not ideal for my purpose.</li>
    <li> Works well. No complaints.</li>
    <li> The best brush ever! The only brush that makes my dry hair not to electrify.</li>
    <li> I like this brush and it is the right size for drying and curling my hair.  It fits just right in my hand.  My only complaint is that it does not last long enough.  I have not had one of these last longer than 6 months.  Each one of these has broken off at the handle within six months of use.  I don&#x27;t know if constant use with hot air with the hair drying or hitting the floor once in a while that causes the fracture.  The original one I had of these lasted forever, but the ones they are making now just don&#x27;t last.  I still are my favorite brush to use and I buy several to have a spare when they break, but I would think that they shouldn&#x27;t break this often.</li>
    <li> Robust and nice design but pulls out quite some hair</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS BRUSH! It got tangled in my hair so quick and i lost so much hair trying to untangle my hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect brush for my short hair</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t tangle (thats all i care about)</li>
    <li> I received this brush in the mail not too long ago and I decided to try it out today. I washed my hair and let it stand to air dry for a couple of minutes. Next, I use a blow dryer along with the Conair Professional Round Brush. And while I was brushing my hair got tangled in the comb so I decided to pull my hair out because it was starting to hurt. Then I realize I won&#x27;t be able to get the brush out because it was too tangled up already. The end result was I had to cut a huge chunk of hair off and I am just very disappointed. I would think Conair would have made a better &amp;#34;blow-dry styling&amp;#34; brush. I am just very DISAPPOINTED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I would not recommend wasting money to buy this brush- do not bother.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  It is not small but not large in size and is perfect for use with a blow dryer!  Also, it does not scratch your scalp!  Love it and would recommend!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my mid length haircut. Big but not too big. Perfect!</li>
    <li> Great product........will order the small size too.  Recommended item for blow drying hair.</li>
    <li> makes my new haircut look great!</li>
    <li> This brush works well, however; it&#x27;s smaller then expected!  I assumed with it being a size &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; it would be bigger....</li>
    <li> Possibly the worst round brush ever made. Tangled in hair, does not roll through easily like a round brush is supposed to. Yanked tons of my hair out trying to use it.</li>
    <li> These Conair Professional Round Brushes are perfect for straightening hair during blow drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thick and naturally wavy and I can straighten it using only this brush as I am blow drying it. I never have to use a flat iron (which is very damaging to your hair). And the bristles of the brush are nylon ball tipped so that they are very easy on your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing my hair I use the brush to grasp my hair at the root (with the brush underneath the hair and the hair on top of brush) and while carrying the brush through my hair from root to tip, I follow above the hair with a blow dryer. This dries my hair while straightening it at the same time. The metal base under the bristles of the brush is heated by the hot air from the blow dryer, which helps to smooth and straighten the hair as you dry it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are very hard to find in stores and when I was able to find them I bought several to have as backups. Some of those have already accidentally been left behind when traveling so it was great to find them available here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a nice brush with strong bristles and the handles doesn&#x27;t cramp up my hand but I really need one even larger for my hair.</li>
    <li> Works great! Replaced for one we&#x27;ve had for a long time.</li>
    <li> This is the worst brush ever.  My hair got stuck in it for almost a half hour.  My daughter later used it and it took me a half hour to remove each strand of hair from the brush.  Total garbage!!</li>
