      <li>I love these</li>
      <li>I LOVE the Olay cleansing cloths.  </li>
      <li>I threw away most of it.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and cleans well</li>
      <li>While the product does remove foundation easily, water proof mascara is a challenge.</li>

      <li>Super product!</li>
      <li>Left my hands and face smelling good too :)</li>
      <li>I keep them on hand so that I can wash my makeup off quickly and easily.</li>
      <li>As a result, I feel they don&#x27;t clean well</li>
      <li>and it is very easy to use, not messy.  </li>
      <li>Great cloths, I use them everyday.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a loyal Olay user and these wet cloths are one of my favorite products!</li>
      <li>One of my favorite facial cleansers.</li>
      <li>Funny though, I seemed to be using them so fast until I realized that my husband was using them, too!  </li>
      <li>Does a fantastic job, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin or eyes.</li>
      <li>The order was exactly what I asked for &amp; arrived in an anticipated correctly stated time.  </li>
      <li>The sheets are large enough for a refreshing wipe on face and neck.</li>
      <li>Since we&#x27;re limited to the one small baggie for liquid or gel products when we fly, these pack easily and don&#x27;t fall into the category of restricted products.</li>
      <li>She says they really help remove her make up, and are much easier to use than a wash cloth.</li>
      <li>I do the laundry, and can tell you that not having to worry about the mascara on those wash cloths has made my job much easier.</li>
      <li>It really does remove all of your makeup, even eye makeup.</li>
      <li>The fabric of the wipe threads easily on the face and causes a lot of stray threads to be left near the hairline.</li>
      <li>but I can use these to take off my makeup at night and freshen up in the morning without making a mess:)</li>
      <li>They do not leave your skin dry, so i sometimes use them during the day for a quick fresh up after being outside.</li>
      <li>And only one cloth does the trick, even though I do use a mascara remover first to take care of my eyes.</li>
      <li>The texture is soft.</li>
      <li>for some reason, it was slightly stinging my eyes a bit, but the sting quickly stopped.</li>
      <li>They do clean well and leave a very faint perfume which isn&#x27;t disgustingly strong.</li>
      <li>Not sure if I will continue with this product as the scent is a little too potent.</li>
      <li>I hate to wash my face, it never looks as easy in real life as those models make it look on tv!!!</li>
      <li>You really need to scrub a little.  </li>

    <li> They are wet and they cleanse.. What else can I say?</li>
    <li> These cleansing cloths do the job of removing make up conveniently and efficiently. They do a good job of cleaning thoroughly which can be a problem with some products. They&#x27;re great for travel. Since we&#x27;re limited to the one small baggie for liquid or gel products when we fly, these pack easily and don&#x27;t fall into the category of restricted products. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with adverse skin reaction using these cloths, and they don&#x27;t irritate my eyes. I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use these.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used lots of cleansing cloths before and i really feel like this works the BEST out of all of them. It really does remove all of your makeup, even eye makeup. when i use this, i don&#x27;t have to feel like i have to wash my face again with makeup cleanser. also, usually when i only use cleansing cloths at night, i eventually end up breaking out with a few zits, but not with this one. for some reason, it was slightly stinging my eyes a bit, but the sting quickly stopped.</li>
    <li> I have used a different brand of cleansing cloths for years but once I tried the Olay I&#x27;m a convert.  The Olay wipes have a pleasant mild scent and are nicely moist. Remove make-up or just freshen up.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the Olay cleansing cloths.  They always get the makeup (even eye makeup) off with one cloth and my face feels so refreshed!!</li>
    <li> This product makes it so convenient to clean my face at night when I&#x27;m tired and lazy.  I keep them on hand so that I can wash my makeup off quickly and easily.

    <li> She says they really help remove her make up, and are much easier to use than a wash cloth. I do the laundry, and can tell you that not having to worry about the mascara on those wash cloths has made my job much easier. Since we have them on subscribe and save, she&#x27;s never in any danger of running out.</li>
    <li> The Olay wet cleansing cloths are a bit dry compared to some other brands I&#x27;ve tried. As a result, I feel they don&#x27;t clean well enough.&lt;br /&gt;If someone is using these to remove heavy makeup, I doubt they will be pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, these are great for traveling because I don&#x27;t need to worry liquid spilling out of the resealable opening. The texture is soft. The sheets are large enough for a refreshing wipe on face and neck. They are however thin and not good to clean up a mess. I usually carry baby wet towels while traveling but some of them has strong baby fragrance and are too drying for the face.

    <li> The order was exactly what I asked for &amp; arrived in an anticipated correctly stated time.  I would recommend you to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> The fabric of the wipe threads easily on the face and causes a lot of stray threads to be left near the hairline. I was a bit disappointed with these. They do clean well and leave a very faint perfume which isn&#x27;t disgustingly strong.</li>
    <li> This cleansing cloths hurt my eyes, when i tried to remove my eye makeup it stinks my eyes!&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be buying any olay wet wipes anymore. I tried the Olay regenerist micro-exfoliating wet too and it also hurt my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer neutrogena wipes, they&#x27;re gentler in removing my eye makeup.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I will continue with this product as the scent is a little too potent. It does the job well, however.</li>
    <li> I like these cleansing cloths because they are easy to use and seem effective in taking off my make-up etc...  I use them when I travel and sometimes at home when I am too tired to properly wash my face.  They also have a pleasant smell compared to others I have tried.</li>

    <li> I always have a pack of these in my bag, at my house, and at my work. They take off all of my makeup (even waterproof) and they smell really nice. I love these and I am subscribed to receive them every month.</li>
    <li> I like it cause it is very handy to take to trips and it is very easy to use, not messy.  But it did not take away all the make up, especially eye make up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a loyal Olay user and these wet cloths are one of my favorite products! I hate to wash my face, it never looks as easy in real life as those models make it look on tv!!!

    <li> One of my favorite facial cleansers. Does a fantastic job, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin or eyes. Olay does a great job.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed. While the product does remove foundation easily, water proof mascara is a challenge. You really need to scrub a little.  The product also burns my eyes .  The towelettes are a little to thin .</li>
    <li> Cooling face wipes. Use every day.</li>
    <li> Love these great for the winter dryness</li>
