      <li>It was a nice surprise and the kind I chose for myself because of the two in one option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You can pick  your own colors, which is a plus.  </li>

      <li>Good product for a great price and fast delivery.  </li>
      <li>These made great gifts for a large group of girls from all ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
      <li>Overall I was happy with them!</li>
      <li>I was still able to pick my desired color options.</li>
      <li>I will probably order more.</li>
      <li>More of a one size fits most.</li>
      <li>I loved them so much I&#x27;ve been wearing one myself.</li>
      <li>My headbands were ordered for a 12 year old softball team so I&#x27;m sure they will work ok for most.</li>
      <li>She LOVES the colors and the fit.</li>
      <li>Arrived as expected and beautifully made.</li>
      <li>They put them on as soon as they got them and loved them instantly!  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended! :)</li>
      <li>The headband construction is top-notch and the designs are highly visible and not muddled as some other headbands that I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping,great product..will order more very soon!!</li>

      <li>Very fast delivery.  </li>

      <li>Exactly what we were looking for and as described.</li>
      <li>Arrived FAST!  </li>
      <li>She has other brand name (UA) headbands which are nice</li>
      <li>but she wears these as much as she wears those.</li>
      <li>They will sometimes come apart after a lot of wear but are easily fixed with some hot glue.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The colors I picked were purple, which is closer to a pink color, purple zebra, which was the favorite design and went the quickest for prize picks, and purple cheetah which is actually reversible with a light purple solid sparkly side you can choose to wear if you want a change from the cheetah pattern.</li>
      <li>These appear to be different quality than the first ones I ordered.</li>
      <li>The headbands stay on their heads without slipping off as so many of the other headbands do.  </li>
      <li>Considering the fact that I&#x27;ve bought these same exact headbands at travel ball tournaments before for $5-$10, I will definitely will be ordering from this company again.</li>
      <li>They fit heads as young as five year olds, and as old as 50&#x27;s without feeling too loose or too tight.</li>

<li> We ordered this because 12 were going to my daughters softball team and she wanted a few extra for herself.</li>
<li> -the navy glitter headbands have just the right amount of sparkle, but still keep the girls hair out of their eyes so they can focus on their game!  </li>
<li> : I was a little confused about color requests at first because I received a shipped notice from Amazon before I was contacted by the seller to request colors, but it turned out that Amazon generated the tracking number and sent it to me before the purchase order was completed-</li>
<li> so she could have a multitude of choices for her school colors, her travel softball team and everyday use.</li>
<li> It seemed like the adhesive they used to keep them together failed.</li>
<li> Disappointed!</li>

    <li> They were just what I wanted</li>
    <li> The ladies loved them</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas present for our 3 rd and 4the grade basketball team.  They put them on as soon as they got them and loved them instantly!  It helped that their team name is Bling and our color is navy blue-the navy glitter headbands have just the right amount of sparkle, but still keep the girls hair out of their eyes so they can focus on their game!  Highly recommended! :)</li>
    <li> After 3-4 wears the bands broke. It seemed like the adhesive they used to keep them together failed. They all broke in the same spot and after minimal use. Disappointed!</li>
    <li> I used these at my daugthers&#x27; &amp;#34;mermaid party&amp;#34; for her guests to adorn their hair like mermaids - the girls loved them.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses headbands practically everyday for general use and sports. She LOVES the colors and the fit. They don&#x27;t slide off the head easily and seem to be reasonable quality. We bought a 24 pack so she could have a multitude of choices for her school colors, her travel softball team and everyday use. She has other brand name (UA) headbands which are nice but she wears these as much as she wears those. Great product, great variety and awesome customer service with extremely fast shipping. Wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy again!</li>
    <li> I purchased these for a book launch I was having- for prizes. They were the biggest hit. I loved them so much I&#x27;ve been wearing one myself. They fit heads as young as five year olds, and as old as 50&#x27;s without feeling too loose or too tight. It&#x27;s miraculous.&lt;br /&gt;The colors I picked were purple, which is closer to a pink color, purple zebra, which was the favorite design and went the quickest for prize picks, and purple cheetah which is actually reversible with a light purple solid sparkly side you can choose to wear if you want a change from the cheetah pattern. It was a nice surprise and the kind I chose for myself because of the two in one option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing from this company again. These made great gifts for a large group of girls from all ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I was a little confused about color requests at first because I received a shipped notice from Amazon before I was contacted by the seller to request colors, but it turned out that Amazon generated the tracking number and sent it to me before the purchase order was completed- I was still able to pick my desired color options. And I was thrilled with the quality and look of the bands.</li>
    <li> Arrived as expected and beautifully made. Only issue is the elastic straps as not adjustable. More of a one size fits most. So if ordering for a younger child or team please be mindfully of this.  My headbands were ordered for a 12 year old softball team so I&#x27;m sure they will work ok for most.</li>
    <li> I bought these hairbands for all four of my Granddaughters and they loved the glittery headbands.  The headbands stay on their heads without slipping off as so many of the other headbands do.  The headbands are only about 1&amp;#34; wide and I wish they were a little wider but a good purchase for the money spent.</li>
    <li> Great price. I have one to match every outfit lol ...glitter doesnt fall off like some others I have had.</li>
    <li> My girls love these headbands!  Very fast delivery.  Would recommend these to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping,great product..will order more very soon!!</li>
    <li> Very cute variety! We ordered this because 12 were going to my daughters softball team and she wanted a few extra for herself. I told them to surprise us with the extra colors and they didnt disappoint! The words my daughter used were \\&quot;there isnt one here that isnt cute\\&quot;  A couple did break though but they were the ones we gave to the team. I would order these again.</li>
    <li> Our fastpitch team loved them. I will probably order more. My daughter loved them.  They don&#x27;t fall off there heads</li>
    <li> Ordered these for my softball team for their World Series. Have ordered these in the past with no issues but this time, ALL of the headbands broke during the first use. These appear to be different quality than the first ones I ordered. Contacted company for exchange, they initially offered to replace some but I never heard back again after that.</li>
    <li> Arrived FAST!  The girls loved them!</li>
    <li> Good product for a great price and fast delivery.  These were for my daughters softball team and they all loved them!</li>
    <li> These are the only headbands my 13 yro daughter will wear. They will sometimes come apart after a lot of wear but are easily fixed with some hot glue.</li>
    <li> I ordered these headbands to include in Team exchange bags for my daughter&#x27;s World Series trip.  You can pick  your own colors, which is a plus.  Each headband comes individually cellophane wrapped which makes them perfect for giving as gifts.  The headband construction is top-notch and the designs are highly visible and not muddled as some other headbands that I&#x27;ve seen.  You also can&#x27;t beat the price.  24 headbands for $22.  Considering the fact that I&#x27;ve bought these same exact headbands at travel ball tournaments before for $5-$10, I will definitely will be ordering from this company again.</li>
    <li> Very cute headbands! They just get stretched out very easily. Overall I was happy with them!</li>
    <li> How and when do you select the colors wanted?</li>
    <li> Got these for our dance team. Exactly what we were looking for and as described. Received them&lt;br /&gt;Very quickly. Will continue to use this seller.</li>
