      <li>I love this for my daughter&#x27;s curly hair.</li>
      <li>Ok, so I have tried many detanglers for my daughter, some marketed to kids others to adults and drugs store brands as well as salon versions.  </li>
      <li>My daughter and I love this spray.</li>
      <li>I spray this product in on top and underneath while they are eating breakfast.</li>
      <li>Excellent product, local stores did not carry the product, so I had to order it on line.  </li>
      <li>LOVE this stuff for my long-haired toddler.  </li>
      <li>it seems as though so many seem to be counterfeit these days.  </li>
      <li>It does however work great for tangles and leaves her hair very soft.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant smell and lasts a long time which makes it a good value for the price.  </li>
      <li>She has fine curly hair that tangles easily.  </li>
      <li>This stuff does a fantastic job.</li>
      <li>This one is aweosme, my hair is so smooth and doesnt tangle at all.</li>
      <li>This stuff makes brushing my daughters hair a breeze rather than a nightmare filled with &amp;#34;ouch daddy&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>It smells and feels like the cheap stuff you get at stores (that cheap strawberry stuff).</li>
      <li>This is great for tangles after a bath or even throughout the day, especially after sitting in a carseat!</li>
      <li>It leaves my kids&#x27; hair so nice and smooth after they get up and ready for the day.</li>
      <li>Perfect for my little one!</li>
      <li>I doubt this is an original product.  </li>
      <li>I will admit that my daughter loved the new scent at first, but now she isn&#x27;t a fan either.  </li>
      <li>: it sprays a light mist and it smells like light pear not heavy perfume&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>It smells great, does a good job untangling my two daughters long, thick and wavy hair.</li>
      <li>I washed it out right away.  </li>
      <li>I have been buying Paul Mitchell products for the last couple of years and I have always been satisfied, until now.  </li>
      <li>I noticed a difference in the look of all my  Granddaughters hair in the first week of use.</li>
      <li>It now has a strawberry odor which is only appropriate for children, I guess.  </li>
      <li>:  Once dry the hair feels like straw and adding more is not helpful.</li>
      <li>I had previously bought this product from another seller on Amazon last year and it was great.</li>
      <li>So far nothing really has the great balance of soft and silky, vs greasy and heavy or</li>
      <li>This product helps make out mornings a little more bearable.</li>
      <li>they have gone to a new smell, STRAWBERRY BUBBLGUM</li>
      <li>hint for slightly curled hair: add some water (not more than a third of the bottle) - it works still very good</li>
      <li>Make it easy to comb a little girls longish locks.</li>
      <li>My daughters hair is wavy to curly and lots of it, but the strand themselves are not really thick and to top off the finding the right de-tangler issue we have very hard water!  </li>
      <li>Glad to know that I can find this here since its so hard to find elsewhere.</li>
      <li>The one I got smells like old perfume.  </li>
      <li>Works wonders on my 4 year old.  </li>
      <li>Unexpected change of smell by Paul Mitchell.  </li>
      <li>My 18 month old says no no</li>
      <li>Using this spray i can avoid washing too frequently also.</li>
      <li>Not worth it, go to your local beauty place and get the original stuff.</li>
      <li>The first time I bought it, it came boxed up in Paul Mitchell packaging, didn&#x27;t have much of a smell to it other than the typical PM smell, and was soft, even if you put a lot on.</li>
      <li>This product smooths out tangles and leaves the hair so soft and smells terrific.</li>
      <li>Strongly recommend this especially if you have hard water.</li>
      <li>Couldnt live w/out this product; have tons of human hair extensions which get dry, unruly etc.</li>

<li> The have long hair which they don&#x27;t want cut either.</li>
<li> We&#x27;ve had this product previously which had a different (possibly unscented odor).  </li>
<li> i use it after shower as i brush my hair, and i keep doing it brushing it while watching tv, til my hair is dry.</li>
<li> Works on wet or dry hair.</li>
<li> This has just enough conditioner to help tame the curls, but doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair or make it greasy.</li>
<li> then i put all my other products in.</li>
<li> Haven&#x27;t found any other product that works this well.</li>
<li> And it feels like a ton of build up when you put it on (actually has a weird texture to it, like you&#x27;re spraying on hair spray mixed with conditioner and water).</li>
<li> The product I received smelled nothing like the product I have previously bought at a salon.  </li>
<li> this smells like baby powder and does not work on my heavy, thick long hair.  </li>
<li> It is very slightly oily but doesnt weigh down or leave oily feel.</li>
<li> My son complains less when I use this product than any other product I&#x27;ve used while brushing his thick, curly hair.</li>
<li> Does not leave a heavy &amp;#34;producty&amp;#34; feel to the hair, but does help detangle.</li>
<li> I have 2 8 year old girls who hate to have their hair brushed before school.</li>
<li> Not sure what all of the other reviews for this are for, they can&#x27;t be serious.</li>
<li> I would normally give this 5 stars but the new Strawberry smell is awful!  </li>
<li> It works well for what it is -- a way to brush kids hair without too much trouble or complaint.</li>
<li> I bought these new bottles a few months ago and felt I should leave a review here since I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.</li>
<li> This product stinks like cheap perfume, the smell is so bad that it will give you a headache!!.  </li>
<li> What a waste and disappointment</li>
<li> unfortunately I had to leave it in, as it was time for school!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not the strawberry smell that others are talking about that is bad.  </li>
<li> Hate hair products that smell like fruit; this does not.  </li>
<li> Absolutely disgusting.</li>
<li> The smell is horrible.  </li>
<li> It smelled terrible and it felt horrible on my hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My kids prefer this rather than me washing their hair each morning. Great product for bed head.</li>
    <li> I have 5 children and 4 have unruly hair.  This is great for tangles after a bath or even throughout the day, especially after sitting in a carseat!</li>
    <li> I love this for my daughter&#x27;s curly hair. Works well.</li>
    <li> Use this daily.  Leaves hair manageable.  Not sticky and doesn&#x27;t smell as though it should be edible.  Hate hair products that smell like fruit; this does not.  Glad to know that I can find this here since its so hard to find elsewhere.</li>
    <li> The BEST detangler we have ever used!!!</li>
    <li> I have been buying Paul Mitchell products for the last couple of years and I have always been satisfied, until now.  This product stinks like cheap perfume, the smell is so bad that it will give you a headache!!.  I doubt this is an original product.  The seller says the reason for this is because Paul Mitchell changed the scent to strawberry bubblegum, but believe me this is not the strawberry bubblegum scent that you will be expecting for this type of product. Not worth it, go to your local beauty place and get the original stuff.</li>
    <li> The smell is horrible.  It&#x27;s not the strawberry smell that others are talking about that is bad.  The one I got smells like old perfume.  My 18 month old says no no no when I start to use it on her.  It makes her cough and sneeze.  It does however work great for tangles and leaves her hair very soft.</li>
    <li> Awesome spray.  Works wonders on my 4 year old.  This product helps make out mornings a little more bearable.</li>
    <li> This taming spray is the best spray for curly hairs I ever had. I can fully recommend this product. hint for slightly curled hair: add some water (not more than a third of the bottle) - it works still very good and you save money!</li>
    <li> I have used this for 7 years on my daughter..it was the perfect answer for her curly hair.  they have gone to a new smell, STRAWBERRY BUBBLGUM....how gross is that....my daughter almost cried when I put it in her hair....unfortunately I had to leave it in, as it was time for school!</li>
    <li> This is awesome! It leaves my kids&#x27; hair so nice and smooth after they get up and ready for the day. And it smells amazing too</li>
    <li> Unexpected change of smell by Paul Mitchell.  It now has a strawberry odor which is only appropriate for children, I guess.  Absolutely disgusting.</li>
    <li> I have 2 8 year old girls who hate to have their hair brushed before school. The have long hair which they don&#x27;t want cut either. I spray this product in on top and underneath while they are eating breakfast. When they are done a brush it and works great. Haven&#x27;t found any other product that works this well.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes brushing my daughters hair a breeze rather than a nightmare filled with &amp;#34;ouch daddy&amp;#34;. Strongly recommend this especially if you have hard water.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I have tried many detanglers for my daughter, some marketed to kids others to adults and drugs store brands as well as salon versions.  So far nothing really has the great balance of soft and silky, vs greasy and heavy or when it dries it&#x27;s like straw.  My daughters hair is wavy to curly and lots of it, but the strand themselves are not really thick and to top off the finding the right de-tangler issue we have very hard water!  Well here are the pros and cons of the Paul Mitchell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: it sprays a light mist and it smells like light pear not heavy perfume&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Once dry the hair feels like straw and adding more is not helpful.</li>
    <li> It works well for what it is -- a way to brush kids hair without too much trouble or complaint. We&#x27;ve had this product previously which had a different (possibly unscented odor).  In Spring 2014, this now seems to have a sort of cherry smell, which my daughter is not fond of.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. It saves a lot of time and no pain for my daughter when brushing her hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Make it easy to comb a little girls longish locks.</li>
    <li> I have used PM&#x27;s Taming Spray for Kids for years.  I like it because it&#x27;s a leave-in spray that takes tangles out as well as controlling static which makes short-haired people like me get cowlicks!  It has a pleasant smell and lasts a long time which makes it a good value for the price.  I am lost without it!</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff for my long-haired toddler.  Has a nice, almost cotton candy smell.  Does not leave a heavy &amp;#34;producty&amp;#34; feel to the hair, but does help detangle.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this on our 3 year daughter. Works perfect to detangle her hair and smells really nice (unlike the cheaper alternatives at local stores).</li>
    <li> This stuff does a fantastic job. Great for tangly hair. And has a conditioning feature to it making it a must have.</li>
    <li> takes the tangles out and smells really good!</li>
    <li> I love this for my daughter&#x27;s hair. She has fine curly hair that tangles easily.  This has just enough conditioner to help tame the curls, but doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair or make it greasy. Works on wet or dry hair.</li>
    <li> My daughters use the Baby Don&#x27;t Cry Shampoo, and I apply this taming spray every morning before I comb their hair. It smells great, does a good job untangling my two daughters long, thick and wavy hair. Fantastic!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 20 years. I get my hair colored and its the only thing that allows me to comb it out. then i put all my other products in. no conditioner or treatment lets me get a comb through it but this does with no pulling or tugging at my hair. i love love love this product!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My son complains less when I use this product than any other product I&#x27;ve used while brushing his thick, curly hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my little one! He has curly hair and I have tried all brands out there for kids.&lt;br /&gt;Still frizzy, still detangled.&lt;br /&gt;Not with Paul Mitchell! And it smells sooooo good!&lt;br /&gt;FYI, curly, detangled hair is best to brush with a square brush. These are wider and it takes me 3 strokes, done!&lt;br /&gt;Happy kid, happy mom :-)</li>
    <li> this smells like baby powder and does not work on my heavy, thick long hair.  Made for babies only. do not recommend for over the age of  7</li>
    <li> Works great for kids or adults with course hair.</li>
    <li> The product I received smelled nothing like the product I have previously bought at a salon.  It smelled terrible and it felt horrible on my hair.  I washed it out right away.  What a waste and disappointment that I can&#x27;t trust to ever buy any products on Amazon bc it seems as though so many seem to be counterfeit these days.  It&#x27;s a shame!</li>
    <li> Why did Paul Mitchell stop making this stuff. It is the only untangle that doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy. And I can skip washing my hair for one day and this taming spray continues to work great.</li>
    <li> I would normally give this 5 stars but the new Strawberry smell is awful!  I will admit that my daughter loved the new scent at first, but now she isn&#x27;t a fan either.  Why can&#x27;t kids products just smell pleasant and not something sickeningly sweet.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff for our 8 year old son&#x27;s hair after he has rooted into his pillow all night.  We could get it locally until recently; now have to look for it online.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s ok! But don&#x27;t expect a miracle! It&#x27;s easier to cumb your hair  if you use a lot of it. The smell is perfect!</li>
    <li> I had previously bought this product from another seller on Amazon last year and it was great. However, this one is TOTALLY different. I bought these new bottles a few months ago and felt I should leave a review here since I&#x27;m extremely disappointed. It smells and feels like the cheap stuff you get at stores (that cheap strawberry stuff). The first time I bought it, it came boxed up in Paul Mitchell packaging, didn&#x27;t have much of a smell to it other than the typical PM smell, and was soft, even if you put a lot on. When I bought them from this seller they came shrink-wrapped in plastic not boxed up (which is making me think it was counterfeit but who knows). And it feels like a ton of build up when you put it on (actually has a weird texture to it, like you&#x27;re spraying on hair spray mixed with conditioner and water). I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this. Not sure what all of the other reviews for this are for, they can&#x27;t be serious.</li>
    <li> This product smooths out tangles and leaves the hair so soft and smells terrific.I noticed a difference in the look of all my  Granddaughters hair in the first week of use.They don&#x27;t mind getting their hair brushed now because the tangles come out easier.</li>
    <li> This one is aweosme, my hair is so smooth and doesnt tangle at all. i use it after shower as i brush my hair, and i keep doing it brushing it while watching tv, til my hair is dry. and it was as smooth as silk!</li>
    <li> Couldnt live w/out this product; have tons of human hair extensions which get dry, unruly etc. Using this spray i can avoid washing too frequently also. It is very slightly oily but doesnt weigh down or leave oily feel.</li>
    <li> Awesome!! My daughter and I love this spray. It detangles and smells great!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, local stores did not carry the product, so I had to order it on line.  Great for a tender headed kid when brushing out those rats.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t help my 5 yo daughters tangles</li>
</ol>
