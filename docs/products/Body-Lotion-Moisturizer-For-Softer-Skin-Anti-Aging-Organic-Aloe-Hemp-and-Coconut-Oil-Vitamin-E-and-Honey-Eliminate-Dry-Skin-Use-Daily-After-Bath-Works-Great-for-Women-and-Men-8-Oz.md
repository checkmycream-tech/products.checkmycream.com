      <li>Worth every penny!  </li>
      <li>When I originally ordered this lotion k thought it was scented.  </li>
      <li>It works great for slightly dry areas.</li>
      <li>It gets absorbed very quickly and doesn’t leave any residue.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not something that smell sweet, but rather just a someone earthy</li>
      <li>I love that this lotion is in a pump bottle since it makes it so much easier to get out of the bottle.</li>
      <li>but it is not bad.</li>
      <li>The Mee Bee Moisturized lotion is a perfect solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the lotion, my hands regained their natural softness and the dry look disappeared.  </li>
      <li>I like it better than most scented brands since once you add up all the different scents from shampoo, hairspray, deodorant, face lotions, etc.</li>
      <li>The texture was greasy upon application and the moisturizing results disappeared quickly.</li>
      <li>I keep it by the bed to quickly moisturize before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I found it very interested that it was formulated by a beekeeper.</li>
      <li>I noticed the lotion absorbs quickly into my skin and does a good job of hydrating dry skin.  </li>
      <li>This is a wonderful everyday lotion for normal skin.</li>
      <li>I’m glad that the price was reduced from $20 to make it a better value for the price as it’s not a very large bottle.</li>
      <li>It absorbs a LOT and everything that is absorbed affects the body in one way or another.  </li>
      <li>After I mentioned the smell in this review, the company got in touch and sent me a new bottle, they said it probably was in a very hot delivery truck, which could be true as I am in Los Angeles and it has been VERY hot.</li>
      <li>Nice packaging, went on creamy and smooth but smelled like sour cheese.</li>
      <li>I liked the lotion, but the smell was a little strong.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I liked the lotion, but the smell was a little strong.</li>
    <li> Nice lotion, lightly scented, absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> Nice, light lotion - probably better for spring/summer. It does not feel very moisturizing so if you have very dry skin this is not for you. I probably won&#x27;t buy it again for that reason, especially given its price but it is not bad.</li>
    <li> Great lotion. A little goes a long way. I use one pump for the lower half of my body and one for the upper. Has a light scent that quicly disappears.</li>
    <li> It does not moisturize your body, even has not scented smells terrible!! I won&#x27;t ever buy again and I am dessapointed!</li>
    <li> The fact that this lotion is organic aloe infused with pure honey and hemp oil is what got me to accept this product at a promo price for testing and review.  I am so sick of chemicals and other unnatural ingredients on the market today - each one of them claiming that they are good for your skin.  Your skin is your largest organ.  It absorbs a LOT and everything that is absorbed affects the body in one way or another.  There are no parabens and it is made in the  United States.  This lotion is light and is very good on dry skin. It took care of the dryness and that &amp;#34;crepe-y&amp;#34; look that skin can get when it is in need of moisture.  A little goes a long way.  It gets 5 stars for effectiveness and for the fact that they donate to save the honeybees (a VERY good cause).  I did take away one star for the scent.  I know it is unscented but the ingredients themselves have a &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; and while it does not bother me, it could be off-putting to others.  I am thinking about mixing some essential oils in so that their scent covers the natural one.  A good product if you are looking for all natural.  It&#x27;s effective and good or your skin.  This opinion is my own and was given after testing the product.</li>
    <li> When I originally ordered this lotion k thought it was scented.  It is not scented however I&#x27;m always looking for natural or organic products that don&#x27;t use chemicals or as much chemicals as most of the other brands use in their products.  After using this body lotion for a few weeks I see a difference in my skin.  It feels more mosterized.  If you are looking for a more naturalized lotion this brand is Deff the way to go.</li>
    <li> I received Mee Beauty Best Daily Body Lotion Moisturizer by Purely Mee, Inc and I really do like it. This is the absolute best lotion to use for anyone that has severe skin sensitivities because it is completely paraben free. There are no fragrances and no dyes. It is completely organic made from all natural ingredients. It can be used by men, women and children of all ages with any skin issues/types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put just a small dollup of cream on my wrist and was able to spread it over the entire inside of my arm so a little lotion will go a long way. My arm feels incredibly soft and there are no residual feels of lotion on my hand or my arm after my test application. I love the infusion of honey in the lotion because honey is great for skin. Honey contains antioxidants, it prevents bacterial growth and is locks in moisture to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this product is made in the USA with local honey, not honey imported from other countries. They make sure that they know the quality of their ingredients and keep the job and resources in our country.  I found it very interested that it was formulated by a beekeeper. I also really appreciate and admire that Purely Mee donates 1% of their annual profit to help saving honeybees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They stand behind their product with a challenge to compare their products to other well known products (ie Bath and Body Works)</li>
    <li> Where I live it is like a desert and it is extremely dry in the winter. My skin gets itchy from being so dry but no more. This lotion solves all my dry skin problems. Usually when I use lotion I have to add oil to it in the winter. This lotion already has hemp oil and coconut oil in it. So really it is perfect. This is also great for sensitive skin. When I use this lotion I feel healed and nurtured. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this body lotion in exchange for a review. This review is my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve found. I have very sensitive skin that reacts poorly to 99% of lotions, but not this one. Great for me.</li>
    <li> I love that this lotion is in a pump bottle since it makes it so much easier to get out of the bottle. I do tend to have sensitive skin but this lotion seems to be perfect for my skin. I love the consistency of it since it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky. It also absorbs really well into the skin so you don&#x27;t have to worry about weird residue. There is a smell to this lotion that I like; it is fragrance free but with the ingredients that this lotion has in it the smell is just those all combined together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the size of the bottle since I personally don&#x27;t use a TON of lotion, specially with this lotion since it absorbs so well, it will definitely last me quite awhile! I love that it&#x27;s Paraben free and cruelty free! I would definitely recommend this lotion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and when I received it, I was truly amazed and happy with it. I am a big fan of creams for the body and face and I spend a lot of  money on it. Mee Body Lotion is really good. Not only does it leave  your skin feeling smooth and soft it is also not greasy. It also smells really good. Did I mention that its made with real honey which has a lot of vitamins .Honey  has been known to cure and heal the body. Honey is really good. I am really loving this lotion. I am really happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely body lotion. It goes into the skin leaving no greasy film. it is expensive so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll order it again.</li>
    <li> Feels good, made my skin soft. Didn&#x27;t care for the off smell, also wherever I put it I would get attacked by bugs and was covers in bug bites.</li>
    <li> Love love love this lotion! It feels so light going on but is extremely moisturizing!</li>
    <li> Truly keeps my skin moisturized and soft.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion for winter. I can definitely feel it moisturizing my skin, however for the price, it&#x27;s definitely on the expensive side. $20 for a small 8oz bottle is not worth it when there are equivalent lotions being made with organic products at half the price, with larger portions. Will use this one alternatively with other lotions.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful everyday lotion for normal skin. It works great for slightly dry areas. It isn&#x27;t greasy and absorbs well. It isn&#x27;t the best scent ever but it works well. I keep it by the bed to quickly moisturize before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Very nice lotion!  Light texture, feels great on skin and is very soothing.</li>
    <li> I like it better than most scented brands since once you add up all the different scents from shampoo, hairspray, deodorant, face lotions, etc. you really don&#x27;t need a scented lotion too!  It&#x27;s fast absorbing and seems to last a long time.  It leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife in the middle of summer. When it showed up the lotion had the consistency of water. We let it cool down a few days and shook it up hoping it would come back together. Sadly it did no, so we contacted the seller and shipped it back and got a refund. Then 4 months later my wife gets an email saying they wanted to send us a bottle of the newly reformulated product for free. We both like it a lot, it smells great, isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy and feels nice.</li>
    <li> This year&#x27;s brutal winter had left my skin the driest it&#x27;s ever been and I&#x27;d tried all of my regular lotions without much relief so when a friend told me about the benefits of honey infused lotions I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  Mee Body Lotion is infused with pure honey straight from the hive, hemp oil, vitamin E, organic coconut and aloe and is cruelty and fragrance free.  In the past year I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin has become sensitive so it was important for me to find a lotion that wouldn&#x27;t irritate it, this lotion left my skin feeling deeply hydrated and moisturized, it&#x27;s the softest and most supple it&#x27;s been in years.  All the other lotions I tried just seemed to be &amp;#34;sucked up&amp;#34; by my dehydrated skin but this this body lotion kept working long after I applied it, leaving my skin conditioned and summer ready.  I also love that this company gives 1% of their annual revenue to efforts to help save honeybees.  This is a product I would definitely recommend to family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price or the item was supplied to me in exchange for the purposes of a product review. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest &amp; unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> The lotion goes on easily and absorbs quickly. I love the product!</li>
    <li> This lotion has such a natural feel and leaves your skin silky smooth for hours. No gross oily residue or overpowering smell. Just one application and I was hooked! I couldn&#x27;t stop running my fingers over the soft soft skin. Definitely recommend, along with all of Mee Beauty products! I have a new favorite brand!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many lotions  and this one feels great. It goes on light and hydrates my skin with a light scent of honey. Honey is an antibacterial so this will probably keep my hand germ-free without the harsh antibacterials filled with alcohol.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is perfect for any time of the year. I usually use a heavier lotion in the winter and a lighter lotion in the summer, but with this lotion I can simplify by using one lotion year round. I love it because it is the perfect combo, it allows your skin to breathe and absorbs completely without leaving any residue. It&#x27;s light aroma is barely detectable so you can wear it without worrying that it will conflict with your perfume. As I said, I love the product and I have recommended it to my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00BS1SP2U Body Lotion Moisturizer with Raw Honey and Hemp Oil]]</li>
    <li> No smell, soft hands, and no greasy feel --what&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I was disappointed in this product. Despite being described as unscented it had a slightly sour smell. The texture was greasy upon application and the moisturizing results disappeared quickly. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again or recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of this lotion!  I&#x27;m going to start using this as my main body lotion to reduce my exposure to so many dangerous chemicals! Lovely smell (just from the ingredients as it is unscented).  Love it!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! I have been looking for a lotion that is all natural, unscented and that will keep my skin moisturized. I use this lotion all over, on my face and my body and it is perfect. It is not too greasy, but has enough moisturizing power to keep my sensitive, dry skin mosturized for hours. I have been using it for several months now and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My skin gets really dry in the winter months, so I’m really excited to get this body lotion. I really like it that it’s practically fragrance-free. I don’t like overwhelming fragrances from lotions. This body lotion is thinner than a hand lotion. It gets absorbed very quickly and doesn’t leave any residue. I think it’ll keep my skin healthy during the cold months. I will definitely save it for the winter. I normally don’t need to use lotion on my whole body, just my arms and elbows, so I think this bottle will last me for a while. The pump is nice and easy to push. This lotion is made out of natural ingredients with no harsh chemicals. I’m glad that the price was reduced from $20 to make it a better value for the price as it’s not a very large bottle. I received this product at a promotional price for testing and reviewing purposes and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Admittedly I do like a fragrance, however, there are people who scour ingredients lists to find fragrance-free products.  Fragrances can cause some serious issues with some people and I&#x27;ve seen it up close.  The Mee Beauty Bee Moisturized body lotion does have a scent, but it&#x27;s one that comes from the blend of the ingredients themselves.  It&#x27;s not something that smell sweet, but rather just a someone earthy fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time of year is when everyone has dry skin.  This isn&#x27;t a large amount of lotion (only 8 ounces), but rather one I&#x27;ll keep on my desk to moisturize my hands as needed during the day.  The lotion does absorb quite nicely into my skin, moving that flaky look right out the door.  I do know when I wash my hands frequently now my hands dry out quickly.  The Mee Bee Moisturized lotion is a perfect solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the lotion, my hands regained their natural softness and the dry look disappeared.  It didn&#x27;t take a lot of lotion, but just a small pea-sized amount.  The lotion can be used for the entire body, but is rather pricey.  I do find that concentrated ones such as the Mee Beauty, go much further on my body than larger containers of rather watered down ones.  You do get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*►  Paraben-Free&lt;br /&gt;*►  FragranceFree&lt;br /&gt;*►  DyeFree&lt;br /&gt;*►  Cruelty-free&lt;br /&gt;*►  All Natural Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;*►  Organic Aloe and Coconut Oil&lt;br /&gt;*►  Hemp Oil&lt;br /&gt;*►  Pure Honey&lt;br /&gt;*►  4.5 - 5.5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not seeing an objectionable ingredients.  I do like to read about a company and check out mission statements, especially when the products are derived from animals or insects.  The company states that:  \\&quot;We are first and foremost beekeepers tending to our bees and making sure they are happy and healthy. We use natural beekeeping methods without pesticides or chemicals.\\&quot;  This, along with a high-quality body lotion, makes it doubly nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe barbadensis (Organic Aloe) Juice, Rosa damascena (Rose) Distillate, Cocos nucifera (Organic Coconut) Oil, Pure Honey, Vegetable Glycerin, Palm Stearic Acid, Emulsifying Wax, Hamamelis virginiana (Witch Hazel), Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Phenoxyethanol, Cannabis sativa (Hemp) Oil, Xanthan Gum (Polysaccharide Gum), Salix nigra (Black Willowbark) Extract, Azadirachta indica (Neem) Oil, Rosmarinus officinalis (Rosemary) Oleoresin, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MEE BEAUTY:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00BSWLOR2 Best Night Cream Moisturizer for Dry Skin By Mee Beauty with Avocado Oil, Shea Butter &amp; Pure Honey]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00BSHAYGY Daily Moisturizer - Face Cream By Mee Beauty - Made with Pure Honey &amp; Organic Coconut Oil - Bee Hydrated]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00BS1SP2U Daily Moisturizer Body Lotion for Dry Skin By Mee Beauty with Natural &amp; Organic Ingredients]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00GKTSKKM Moisturizing Body Wash By Mee Beauty Infused with Premium Pure Honey, Organic Aloe Vera, &amp; Green Tea]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.loe barbadensis (Organic Aloe) Juice, Rosa damascena (Rose) Distillate, Cocos nucifera (Organic Coconut) Oil, Pure Honey, Vegetable Glycerin, Palm Stearic Acid, Emulsifying Wax, Hamamelis virginiana (Witch Hazel), Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Phenoxyethanol, Cannabis sativa (Hemp) Oil, Xanthan Gum (Polysaccharide Gum), Salix nigra (Black Willowbark) Extract, Azadirachta indica (Neem) Oil, Rosmarinus officinalis (Rosemary) Oleoresin, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MEE BEAUTY:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00BSWLOR2 Best Night Cream Moisturizer for Dry Skin By Mee Beauty with Avocado Oil, Shea Butter &amp; Pure Honey]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00BSHAYGY Daily Moisturizer - Face Cream By Mee Beauty - Made with Pure Honey &amp; Organic Coconut Oil - Bee Hydrated]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00BS1SP2U Daily Moisturizer Body Lotion for Dry Skin By Mee Beauty with Natural &amp; Organic Ingredients]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00GKTSKKM Moisturizing Body Wash By Mee Beauty Infused with Premium Pure Honey, Organic Aloe Vera, &amp; Green Tea]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> The smell is so horrible I could not put it on my body. It has a very chemically smell that is repelling.</li>
    <li> I just LOVE Me-e lotion and this body lotion is no different! Not only does it have a great scent, there is no oily, sticky residue. During the summer my arms and legs get pretty dry out here in the desert but with the help of Me-e body lotion I can nip that iin the bud. I did receive this product for an honest unbias review. Over all I am super pleased :)</li>
    <li> I have used many facial lotions over the years and enjoy when products are new and natural. Your Body Lotion/Moisturizer provided great satisfaction for being a basic, good moisturizer. It&#x27;s use is proper an all parts of the body and is very universal in hydrating my skin and body. The added Hemp oil provides a good base for keeping myself comfortable as the day wears on. Please keep me informed on additional products that are being produced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Robert March</li>
    <li> While this lotion says it is unscented, it does have a faint odor to it.  Researching this a little it appears the scent is from the ingredients, not from added fragrances.  I solved this by adding my favorite lavender oil to it which made this lotion luxurious and smelling great (purely personal preference as I did not care for the unscented odor).  I noticed the lotion absorbs quickly into my skin and does a good job of hydrating dry skin.  No greasy residue left on my hands after applying. I was able to purchase this product at a discount so I could review it.  I am looking forward to using it on a daily basis to help combat dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*product received free or at a discount in exchange for my review</li>
    <li> I have been using Bee Moisturizer Body Lotion for 2 months. My skin is dry all year &#x27;round but really dry in the winter. With Bee Moisturizer Body Lotion My skin has been smooth and never flaky or cracked.</li>
    <li> Very soothing, not greasy, is absorbed easily into the skin and the moisturizing effect lasts a long time even with my dry skin. Light yet effective and I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Nice packaging, went on creamy and smooth but smelled like sour cheese. Don&#x27;t know if I got it from an expired batch or it&#x27;s just not my kind of scent( not that most people want to smell like sour cheese). I&#x27;m not a fan of honey scented so that may have been what I mistaken as &amp;#34;sourish&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Slightly odd smell, and not nearly as rich as I had hoped. After I mentioned the smell in this review, the company got in touch and sent me a new bottle, they said it probably was in a very hot delivery truck, which could be true as I am in Los Angeles and it has been VERY hot. The new bottle came and it had no scent just as promised. It is really good cream, though myself, I like it heavier and greasier. But most people would LOVE this!</li>
    <li> LOVE this lotion!!  Worth every penny!  A small amount goes a long way, so it&#x27;ll probably last for a while.  It is so moisturizing with no scent.  It leaves my skin feeling amazing and hydrated!  I will continue to purchase as long as it is available.</li>
