      <li>I love it!</li>

      <li>/&gt;Overall, I would recommend trying another Aussie conditioner - this line is amazing, I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>

      <li>This is absolutely the best brand out there!</li>

      <li>will still use my V05 for co-washing during my henna treatments, but Aussie Moist has been great for my hair during these hot and humid summer months in south Florida.</li>
      <li>This conditioner is just ok.  </li>
      <li>3 min moisture conditioner is a step up from this one in my opinion because it gives a lot more moisture...</li>
      <li>but my hair has a love connection w/ Aussie Moist Conditioner</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>My favorite in Aussie is the Moist collection, because it cleans my hair as well as moisturizing it.</li>
      <li>This is one of my all time favorite conditioners.</li>
      <li>&amp; there&#x27;s so many raves about this</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I really love how it makes my hair feel.  </li>
      <li>bought it along with the shampoo (see review for more details) .</li>
      <li>I wanted to love it, but don&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>Most people do not know this but overly flowery scents for you shower routine can trigger allergic/sinus issues.</li>
      <li>but it is necessari some plastic cover on top to airplane transfers.</li>
      <li>the smell is grand....</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s also a bit more pricey.</li>
      <li>and I love the stuff.  </li>
      <li>and I love the way it makes my hair look and feel.</li>
      <li>This has great slip, decent moisture and a yummy smell.</li>
      <li>Its awesome for its price ( I bought it on drugstore.com for $3 per bottle same size free shipping )  </li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft, manageable and smelling great.  </li>
      <li>I love this conditioner, my hair feels smooth.</li>
      <li>The smell is really nice and not over powerful.  </li>
      <li>For dry and light curl hair, this is the best option.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use - just work in and rinse out.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;First of all, the fragrance is really strong.  </li>
      <li>Its truly remarkable and leaves hair shiny soft and fragrant.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my hair very soft and strong for a good price.</li>
      <li>I bought this brand because I wanted to try something new and heard good reviews about it.  </li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need to use a lot to get the smooth feeling and tangle free in your hear.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t have as much slip as I would have liked.</li>
      <li>Coconut smell, smooth, a lot of product for this price as pack of 6&lt;br /&gt;Cons:</li>
      <li>I have 6 bottles of cheap , non moisturizing conditioner.</li>
      <li>Great product that my wife uses on a daily basis.</li>
      <li>ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE COLORED OR DAMAGED , SKIP this for sure!!</li>
      <li>best results for me with this are obtained by soaking my hair completely,massaging the conditioner into the strands and scalp then towel wrapping for 5 to 7 minutes before showering it out on a low temp water setting,if the water is too hot it will melt and wash out the conditioner coating the hair and scalp before it&#x60;s absorbed thus  </li>
      <li>It takes about 10-30 seconds to comb my medium length fine hair with my old conditioner (Suave Sleek: love it) and it takes more than a minute to comb through all the tangles after using this product.  </li>
      <li>I have terribly dry hair and just assumed that all of the aussie products are as great as the tube I have.  </li>
      <li>Aussie conditioner is by far the best mid price range conditioner on the market.  </li>
      <li>My hair is very picky &amp; doesn&#x27;t like most products</li>
      <li>Aussie is my absolute favorite hair product in the world.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve ever used the Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Deep Conditioner, then this conditioner is fairly weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Quick delivery, too.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;d continue trying different products, as there is SURE to be something better than this out there for you.</li>
      <li>Fantastic thank you very much</li>
      <li>The product works ok on my normal hair</li>
      <li>, I REALLY CHECKED ALL SIDES OF THE BOTTLE INCLUDING  THE BOTTOM ,BUT CAN NOT FIND THEM !&lt;br /&gt;THANKS !</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only brand she&#x27;ll allow me to buy and the coconut-y scent is lovely!</li>
      <li>Great for African hair, relaxed and natural.</li>
      <li>but this is my positive review!</li>
      <li>And while it smells great, it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as some of the other Aussie products.  </li>
      <li>but it seems to work pretty well.</li>
      <li>both good, really comes down to how much you want to pay</li>
      <li>My long curly hair just needs more moisture...</li>
      <li>Maybe sydney smooth, but just barely.</li>
      <li>I have used Aussie products in the past and LOVED how they smelled.  </li>
      <li>Love Aussie, I have very long hair</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this stuff and that says a lot because I usually try to buy more natural products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m your basic Irish-type with fine hair</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> smells good. love it.</li>
    <li> I am a Caribbean woman &amp; I am relaxed, I am a part of several hair boards/blogs catered to Black women w/ kinky or curly hair &amp; there&#x27;s so many raves about this, I always thought Aussie to be for women w/ str8 European textured hair but one day while visting my mom in Pennsylvania where they don&#x27;t have Beauty Supply Stores as stocked as those in NYC I went to Rite Aid seen this was on sale I got it based on all the raves plus my hair was so thirsty. My hair is very picky &amp; doesn&#x27;t like most products but my hair has a love connection w/ Aussie Moist Conditioner....I use it for conditioner washes or after doing a heavy protein treatment, I use it on dry or wet hair &amp; no matter what my hair melts at the sight of it! The slippage I receive from this is remarkable. when I&#x27;m several weeks post relaxer &amp; I have a ton of new growth which very thick &amp; wavy &amp; tight coiled in different areas &amp; once I put this in &amp; wash it out my new growth is detangled almost immediately!    I know another reviewer didn&#x27;t like it as much...but this is my positive review!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve ever used the Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Deep Conditioner, then this conditioner is fairly weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Coconut smell, smooth, a lot of product for this price as pack of 6&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Not as moisturizing as the other Aussie conditioners (hair feels dry at the end of the day), Top of the bottle is hard to open - it takes a lot of force&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend trying another Aussie conditioner - this line is amazing, I&#x27;ve used it for years. But this particular conditioner isn&#x27;t as moisturizing as I would like.</li>
    <li> My daughter has fairly dry, coarse, curly hair so I purchased Aussie Moist hoping that it would help rehydrate her hair. I have to agree with the other poster, this product doesn&#x27;t live up to its name.  And while it smells great, it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as some of the other Aussie products.  The conditioner is fairly thin, and her hair feels a little softer just after rinsing.  However, within an hour or two it looks and feels dry and frizzy once again.  The product works ok on my normal hair but I can&#x27;t recommend it for anyone else.    If you have truly dry hair and are like the smell of Aussie try Cleanse &amp; Mend instead.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African American with natural hair, and I find that this product does a pretty decent job for the price you pay for it. I had a horrible experience with this product, and tried to deep condition with it. NEVER do that. It&#x27;ll be impossible to wash out! It detangles hair wonderfully and smells great. However, it does not make your hair as shiny and healthy looking as other, more expensive but not OVERLY expensive, products. It&#x27;s good for co washing, but I wouldn&#x27;t use this product alone. I don&#x27;t really understand the \\&quot;moist\\&quot; part, because I have used other Aussie products and I don&#x27;t see a difference in how any of their conditioners behave. Maybe sydney smooth, but just barely. All in all, it&#x27;s a good product for what you pay for it...but I&#x27;d continue trying different products, as there is SURE to be something better than this out there for you.</li>
    <li> I love this for my fine limp, but occasionally frizzy hair.  I now prefer it over my more expensive Bumble and Bumble stuff that I had been using.  Love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Product gave me a horrible rash!  Not for use with sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> This conditioner is nice and thick.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot to get the smooth feeling and tangle free in your hear.  The smell is really nice and not over powerful.  The smell is a non gender smell.  My teenage son likes to use this as well.</li>
    <li> I have very curly, very frizzy, pretty dry hair. This is the only thing that works for me. All other shampoos and conditioners just dry it out and make things worse. Make sure to leave it in for ~15 minutes!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001F51PVW Aussie Moist Conditioner, 13.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)]]&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive scalp and skin so down the years i have had some disasters with hair care chemical combinations in some products on the market,so i have to be careful in what i use.&lt;br /&gt;This product is excellent,i can use it frequently and have never had any discomfort or adverse reaction.&lt;br /&gt;The best results for me with this are obtained by soaking my hair completely,massaging the conditioner into the strands and scalp then towel wrapping for 5 to 7 minutes before showering it out on a low temp water setting,if the water is too hot it will melt and wash out the conditioner coating the hair and scalp before it&#x60;s absorbed thus  i would get next to no benefit.&lt;br /&gt;In these days of chemical combinations and additions it&#x60;s great to find a product i can use for its purpose without adverse reaction to it.&lt;br /&gt;*I test any product with a dab on the inside surface my forearm beforehand to see if i have any reaction in advance of using it.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner, my hair feels smooth.</li>
    <li> my mum ,my husband and my friends hate the smelling</li>
    <li> Love Aussie, I have very long hair &amp; it works great! Great price too!</li>
    <li> This conditioner smells like summer vacation and works great. A little goes a long way. Everyone comments on how nice I smell after I use it and all my kids, boys and a girl, love it. Not a girly smell. Just really nice.</li>
    <li> I purchased this conditioner because I have another aussie product in a tube that makes my hair feel absolutely great.  I have terribly dry hair and just assumed that all of the aussie products are as great as the tube I have.  This doesn&#x27;t compare to the other product.  I guess it would be alright for someone with normal hair but it just doesn&#x27;t do a thing for my dry hair.  As always with these aussie products......it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I just expected more.</li>
    <li> One of the best conditioners on the market</li>
    <li> I keep reading reviews for this product for African American and coarse hair types.  I&#x27;m your basic Irish-type with fine hair and I love the stuff.  It&#x27;s really helped with the damage done by my blow dryer and flat iron (I get frizzy sometimes).  It&#x27;s easy to use - just work in and rinse out.  Leaves my hair silky and with plenty of body.</li>
    <li> good. Don&#x27;t care for the smell of it but it seems to work pretty well. I&#x27;d buy again</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have as much slip as I would have liked. Made my hair itch</li>
    <li> I like this conditioner....the smell is grand....I mix up my shampoos and conditioners as your hair can get dull and drab if you use the same one every day....it works for me!</li>
    <li> Great, but it is necessari some plastic cover on top to airplane transfers.</li>
    <li> Most people do not know this but overly flowery scents for you shower routine can trigger allergic/sinus issues. It took me a while to find a product that I still liked the smell of did a good job leaving my hair smooth &amp; kept my allergies at bay. This is one I would recommend no matter what length of hair you have.</li>
    <li> I love it! This is absolutely the best brand out there! The only brand I will ever use!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff and that says a lot because I usually try to buy more natural products. Aussie is my exception because it leaves my very processed and dried out hair super soft!</li>
    <li> Very beautiful, very like</li>
    <li> Aussie is my absolute favorite hair product in the world. My favorite in Aussie is the Moist collection, because it cleans my hair as well as moisturizing it. I get really bad dandruff sometimes and it completely gets rid of that, it makes me hair automatically softer, and the smell is so fruity and it makes you feel happy to wash your hair, which is sometimes a tedious task. There are dandruff products like Neutrogena&#x27;s T-Gel that smells horrible and it is so annoying to use because it is so thick and gelly, but this product is not like that at all.</li>
    <li> great product for the price!! I use this to dilute my expensive conditioner and also when I&#x27;m on vacation and need a boost of moisture, because my hair is dry. Aussies 3 min moisture conditioner is a step up from this one in my opinion because it gives a lot more moisture... but it&#x27;s also a bit more pricey. both good, really comes down to how much you want to pay</li>
    <li> My daughter has very curly multicultural hair that is almost impossible to deal with but with this conditioner she can even do her own hair! It&#x27;s the only brand she&#x27;ll allow me to buy and the coconut-y scent is lovely!</li>
    <li> Fantastic thank you very much</li>
    <li> I was faithfully co-washing my hair with V05 condtioners (moisture milks), but after trying this Aussie Moist....move over V05....you have to share the shelf space. Aussie Moist left my natural hair moisturized, soft, and detangled. Great co-washing conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;I will still use my V05 for co-washing during my henna treatments, but Aussie Moist has been great for my hair during these hot and humid summer months in south Florida.</li>
    <li> The best for my hair.</li>
    <li> Nothing like the 3 minute miracle ones! This is no better than any cheap conditioner you buy at Walmart for a $1. You need a lot of it &amp; it leaves the hair feeling dry and still needing moisterizer. I thought it might be similar to the 3 min thick ones, just not AS great due to the lesser price. I was wrong. I have 6 bottles of cheap , non moisturizing conditioner. ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE COLORED OR DAMAGED , SKIP this for sure!! I will spend the money and get the stuff that actually works.&lt;br /&gt;This feels stripping after rinsed out, and I use a cleaning conditioner to wash my hair, NO sulfates, No suds &amp; this still stripped my hair. Products with a lot of alcohol do this.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing. Will give it away.</li>
    <li> I have used Aussie products in the past and LOVED how they smelled.  I saw this conditioner and its matching shampoo on sale and decided to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the fragrance is really strong.  My and my daughter&#x27;s hair still reeked of the fragrance even after washing with a totally different brand of shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the second use, I noticed a lot of hair breakage while I was combing the conditioner through my hair.  The hair loss was WORSE than what I had with Suave Keratin shampoo and conditioner!  My 9-year-old has very healthy waist-length hair that is NEVER heat styled and she NEVER uses any kind of styling product on it.  This shampoo/conditioner made her lose an alarming amount of hair loss after a couple of uses.  Since switching back to my beloved Coconut Cowash by As I Am Naturally, our amount of hair loss during cleansing/conditioning is back to almost NONE.</li>
    <li> I bought this brand because I wanted to try something new and heard good reviews about it.  The shampoo smells and works great and I also used the conditioner.  when I went to comb my hair I had lots of tangles.  It takes about 10-30 seconds to comb my medium length fine hair with my old conditioner (Suave Sleek: love it) and it takes more than a minute to comb through all the tangles after using this product.  :(  I&#x27;ll finish using it, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my natural long thick curly hair to moisturize it better than even professional brands like the Paul Mitchell and Matrix i typically use.  Its awesome for its price ( I bought it on drugstore.com for $3 per bottle same size free shipping )  Its truly remarkable and leaves hair shiny soft and fragrant.  The main reason this works so effectively is one of the main ingredients is aloe vera and the other is jojoba oil.  I am sticking with this brand as it compliments the Aussie moisturizing shampoo as well.  5 stars on this product</li>
    <li> Great product for co-washing curly hair.</li>
    <li> The cap is so terribly designed that it cut my finger this morning while I was opening it and I started bleeding.</li>
    <li> Great product that my wife uses on a daily basis. She won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I was happy with the product. It&#x27;s the same quality as in the store. Quick delivery, too. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted with a great price.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Worth every cent spent!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing!  Kind of like coconut.  I really love how it makes my hair feel.  I will be ordering this again!</li>
    <li> This has great slip, decent moisture and a yummy smell. I get in the shower, wet my hair thoroughly and squeeze some across my fingertips. I put it in the crown of my head, smooth it down, and I flip my hair over to put some underneath. After that I take a little more and massage it into my scalp, midsections and ends. I let it steam while I bathe and wash my face, then I detangle with my Denman D4 brush under running water. Usually my hair is so tangled that I can&#x27;t even get a wide tooth comb through it, but now that I don&#x27;t have to spend so much time combing out my hair in the shower I can sleep longer in the morning. :) For a while I would rinse a little out and leave the rest in, but I noticed that since it&#x27;s not super moisturizing it made my hair a little dry and brittle, so I only use it to detangle, then I wash it all out.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair very soft and strong for a good price.</li>
    <li> Wife loves and make her hair feel and smell  good!</li>
    <li> CAN ANYONE TELL ME WHER I CAN FIND THE  PRODUCTION DATE OR EXPIRATION DATE ON THIS PRODUCTS , I REALLY CHECKED ALL SIDES OF THE BOTTLE INCLUDING  THE BOTTOM ,BUT CAN NOT FIND THEM !&lt;br /&gt;THANKS !</li>
    <li> The conditioner smells really good.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it along with the shampoo (see review for more details) . The conditiner is creamy and think but does not do anything for my hair. I don&#x27;t have dry or colored treated hair. It&#x27;s long (to my tail bone) I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great for African hair, relaxed and natural. I used it fr cowashes and it leaves u hair amazingly soft</li>
    <li> Great product and shipped well</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, excellente price.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I raise and show Persian cats and this product works really well at repairing and also deep conditioning the coats of my cats.</li>
    <li> This product has great slip and is great for 4c natural hair.  Plus you can&#x27;t find a deal like this in stores.  Must have!!!</li>
    <li> Ever since Tresemme changed the formula of their &amp;#34;Luxurious Moisture&amp;#34; conditioner my life has been a mess. I&#x27;m nothing without my silky soft hair! I went on a mad binge of trying at least 10 different conditioners, and this one emerged victorious. I give it four stars because of it not QUITE living up to my excessively high standards. My much less picky friend came out of this with a ton of free conditioner, so I guess that&#x27;s a plus for them.</li>
    <li> For dry and light curl hair, this is the best option.&lt;br /&gt;But for the best results you might use together with the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
    <li> I have super curly, thick hair, and no other conditioner even -works- for me. Some days I don&#x27;t even have to use a styling product because this moisturizes my hair so well. It&#x27;s thick and smells nice, and it makes my coarse hair soft enough to deal with. It&#x27;s also a great detangler.</li>
    <li> Aussie conditioner is by far the best mid price range conditioner on the market.  It leaves my hair soft, manageable and smelling great.  It&#x27;s the only I buy at the moment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and I love the way it makes my hair look and feel. I&#x27;ve had a few compliments from hair stylists on how soft my hair is and what good shape it&#x27;s in.</li>
    <li> gotta love aussie!!! This has the classic aussie smell, the tropical, coconutty goodness. It always feels my hair smooth and smelling wonderful. This is one of my all time favorite conditioners.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is just ok.  I wanted to love it, but don&#x27;t.  My long curly hair just needs more moisture...it was dull &amp; lifeless when I used this.</li>
