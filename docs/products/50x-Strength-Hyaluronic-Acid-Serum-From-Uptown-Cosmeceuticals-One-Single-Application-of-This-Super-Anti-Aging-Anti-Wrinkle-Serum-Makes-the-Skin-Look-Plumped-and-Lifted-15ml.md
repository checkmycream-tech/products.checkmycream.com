<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was a gift for my mom. She loves it! Was very impressed by the quality and the way it made her face feel and look after using it</li>
    <li> I love this brand. There products never seem to disappoint me. This worked so well for me i love how much comes in it and everything</li>
    <li> Hylauronic acid is well known for wrinkle plumping by drawing water to you skin and making wrinkles less noticeable. This serum has a very high concentration of the HA. All that without a bunch of weird ingredients that dry out or irritate your skin. Not sure how will it will help with wrinkles long term but it makes them look better in the short term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample for my opinion</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product! I have only been using it a couple days and I can already see the difference. My fine lines are not as noticeable. This product also made my facial skin very soft. It does have a slight scent but it is not unpleasant like most facial products. The product arrived on-time and was exactly as described and pictured. I would highly recommend this product to anyone that has fine lines and wrinkles. I look forward to trying other products by Uptown Cosmeceuticals.</li>
    <li> I have tried other products from Uptown and they are all excellent but this is one of my favorites. I use this after I put on a dead sea mud mask and my skin looks amazing after using it. It immediately deep moisturizes and plumps out any creases by my eyes or other problem areas I have. It&#x27;s great on my sensitive skin and is very gentle. A little goes a long way so you don&#x27;t have to use much. I highly recommend this. I was given a discount on this product to get my honest and unbiased thoughts on it. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> How do you compare the hundreds of skin care products? As a regular tester, I&#x27;ve arrived at a list of key considerations. I hope these help you! Before I start, I should note that this and Elleda’s 50X strength hyaluronic acid serum are the exact same product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Fragrance: Odd - very slightly cinnamon-ish?&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel during application: Slightly oily-feeling slippery thin gel.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel after absorption: Sticky and hot. I found the straight gel to be very annoying, and too strong for my arms let alone my face. BUT this is a good thing! Because one drop of this serum, mixed into/applied with your normal amount of your usual serum or moisturizer, will provide it with a super-charge of hyaluronic acid at a lower cost than using this straight.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it best for a certain skin type?: Not for sensitive or oily skin unless diluted with another product.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it tested on animals?: No indication. But the identical Elleda formula has a cruelty-free logo, so I’m assuming this is not animal tested either.&lt;br /&gt;~ Packaging: .5oz plastic pump bottle.&lt;br /&gt;~ Immediate cosmetic effects:* Shiny, hydrated-looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;~ Potential long-term effectiveness:* Hyaluronic acid is one of the most important and effective anti-aging active ingredients. I would not expect great results using this alone, but to boost your other products I think it would be a useful thing for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Know the difference between cosmetic and long-term effects: Cosmetic effects are immediate and only present when the product has been applied recently - just like makeup. Long-term effects take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product (but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support). The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.ncentives or rewards for doing so.

    <li> I bought two or three products from this company at once. They aren&#x27;t bad and comparable to the other brands on Amazon. This was my favorite out of the bunch. My skin feels a bit softer after I put this on. I use it right before bed and have no complaints as of yet. I am a fan of 100% money back guarantees as it takes the risk out of buying these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I could tell a big difference just after one use, my husband even noticed! I like that it&#x27;s really light weight. I am definitely going to keep using it.</li>
    <li> This works great to keep my face from drying out--helps keep my skin hydrated all day and prevent from cracking. It goes on easily under my makeup and does not leave me feeling greasy! I received this as a trial and I&#x27;m very pleased with it!</li>
    <li> worked real well feels good on and it works!!</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad serum but it is thinner and oilier than I prefer.  It did absorb but I was still aware of having something on my facet and it is a little sticky.  It moisturizes my hands well and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy like it does on my face.  Plus, it smells like grain and that is not as noticeable on my hands.  If you have very dry facial skin, this will likely work well on your skin because the oiliness will help seal in some of the moisture.  It might be too much for normal or oily skin.  Discounted sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> Would like something faster and last longer. Tried many  that haven&#x27;t worked. This one does ok, but not the way I would want it to.</li>
    <li> I waited a couple of weeks to review this product to make sure it really lives up to it&#x27;s claims. IT IS AN AMAZING PRODUCT! In just one use it leaves you with soft and moisturized skin and in a couple of weeks it leaves you with beautiful younger looking skin! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to this product is the Hyaluronic Acid. It can hold 4,000 to 5,000 times its own weight in water. This hydrates the skin and reduces the appearance of fine lines and under eye wrinkles and gives you a healthy, plump, smooth and glowing appearance. I don&#x27;t know why we all haven&#x27;t tried an amazing product like this before? It&#x27;s so easy to apply. A little goes a long way. This may look like a small bottle but IT WILL last you a fair amount of time. For $21.50 it really is a great value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> This is some awesome serum. I have been using Hyaluronic Serums before and like them a lot because I have oily and thick skin and usually serums work very well giving me tightness. This serum is slightly different. You don&#x27;t feel tingling or burning but some kind of pleasant tightness on your face. It is strong, I can tell you. The skin feels hydrated also. The description says that it works on molecular level, not sure how but it feels better than after other serums I used before.

    <li> Same as other higger priced serum. the price is the only  thing that was more . Not quality</li>
    <li> it did nothing except make my face shine. it was terrible.</li>
    <li> This face cream has 50 times the strength to reduce wrinkles!  Goes on smooth and until light on your skin. Feels good under your make up and does not affect the staying power of your foundation.  I received the discount for an unbiased and I recommended.</li>
    <li> If it were not for how well this Uptown hyaluronic acid worked on my skin, I would give it less stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros are that my skin does feel hydrated and looks great and I only had to use a little bit for my entire face and neck so a small bottle will last a while. I feel that the product does what it claims to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons are it feels greasy and I absolutely cannot stand the smell. Once it absorbed into my skin, the smell went away, but it is hard to get past the initial reaction as I smell everything. I also noticed that there were a lot of misspelled words on both the box and the label. I feel that a well-reputed company should pay closer attention to detail on their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept using this daily for a week to get honest results since I was given a great discount to test out and review.</li>
    <li> So hydrating! I have combination skin and I&#x27;ve been applying this to the dry areas.  Now, no more dry skin!</li>
    <li> I have tried many face creams, lotions, serums with hyaluronic acid in them. I can say that this is the second best brand I have tried. That is not to say this product is inferior, very far from it. This is the product you want to purchase for a great product at a reasonable price point!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a clear serum and a little goes a long way. I love this serum to help with my dry skin not only on my face for anti-aging but on my elbows, knees, ankles and the tops of my hands where dry skin is a problem. It works wonders if your skin is dry but it is even better to lock in moisture after a bath or shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not notice any smell for this product, it is a slight gel consistency, and clear in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always my opinions are my own based on my experience with this product, I hope that this review helps you in your buying decision.</li>
    <li> Product provided for my opinion and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS STUFF is good!!!  It goes on alone or under makeup.  No harsh smell.  Very silky feeling.  Makes my skin look flawless!  This product isn&#x27;t harsh or skin-stripping at all. In fact, it&#x27;s the exact opposite – a powerful moisture-binding product that keeps skin plump and hydrated and, yes, young-looking. !!!</li>
    <li> this is a  great and the best serum I ever try so true about the 50x strength hyaluronic it so feel so smooth to my skin that right away I notice how moisture and specially this hot humid weather make me not so dry. my skin is dry and even more dry during summer using this make me so healthy skin it make give me more extra take care of this hyaluronic acid skin more moisture giving a Youthful and Radiant Appearance to Skin. I received a discount for this product for quality testing .</li>
    <li> Used it only a couple times so far.  Silky texture when applied, but it is a bit sticky when dry.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what it does to the texture of my akin though!  Honest review got me a great deal!</li>
    <li> This product is nothing short of amazing. My girlfriend is using it and she has noticed a dramatic difference in the wrinkles/skin around her eyes. Before using this product, the wrinkles/skin under her eyes would cause her makeup to cake up causing her to have to smooth it out with her finger. She has reported that after using this product for just under a week, she no longer has to smooth out her makeup as it doesn&#x27;t cake up anymore. Also, the crows feet in corner of her eyes is tightening up as well. I think I will have to start using this. Received this product for review.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:fd3c4fb3ebdec6bc6d7f2a6f3f185caf]]I was a lucky duck to test another product... Although I&#x27;ve only used for less than a week, I have noticed a big difference on my forever aging face.. Wrinkles were less deep and face was hydrated all day long. A morning and evening application was applied. check out the video - ‪#‎uptownCosmeceuticals‬</li>
    <li> Ultra Moisture Magnet Serum 50X Hyaluronic Acid has a unique non-equilibrium gel structure with gel domains that bounds the water tightly. The formula creates a film on the layer of the skin and transports this water over time. The 50X Strength of the Hyaluronic Acid makes it more potent and provides maximum water binding capacity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One single application of this HA makes the skin look a lot younger, radiant and even-toned. Using this moisturizer/serum the skin would be dramatically plumped and lifted with incredible moisture.&lt;br /&gt;This Serum is GENTLE, EFFECTIVE &amp; SAFE for all skin types; including those with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vegan, Paraben-free, oil-free, no dyes, no fragrances or fillers, Oily Skin remedy&lt;br /&gt;- Rejuvenates the look of dull skin for a smoother, more even skin tone&lt;br /&gt;- Helps in fighting with the dryness /redness on face with professional hydration&lt;br /&gt;- Diminishes the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;- Fights with the dark circles under the eyes and the eye puffiness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;50x Strength Hyaluronic Acid can hold 4,000 to 5,000 times its own weight in water. As it binds water to it, the individual molecules expand. This inflation of the Serum on a molecular level helps to plump the skin. It hydrates the skin and reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and gives you a healthy, plump, smooth and glowing appearance. The amazing plumping abilities of 50 x Strength Hyaluronic Acid can be demonstrated with a dried apricot. After a few hours&#x27; immersions in a beaker of the ingredient, a dried apricot will hydrate and plump back to its original shape and my wife totally swears by this product,&lt;br /&gt;wrinkle removing and prevention that is too Frankenstein like for me but what ever it takes for the bride to keep from looking like broom Hilda I good with it.</li>
    <li> Hyaluronic acid is a naturally produced ingredient by the body and helps the skin retain moisture and it&#x27;s youthfulness.  As we age, the body begins to produce less and less hyaluronic acid, resulting in the drying of the skin and adding to the appearance of those fine lines and wrinkles.  We all know that we do not want to have either of those.  So to start off with I would like to say that upon arrival I did pump some of the serum onto my finger tips and began applying in an upward motion.  Why upward you ask?  Because I am a licensed cosmetologist on of the things that you learn is to when you apply anything  to your face you always want to apply in an upward motion.  This serum is packed with moisture and did not leave any type of sticky residue.  I would also like to add that I have sensitive skin and sense using this I have not had any adverse reactions.  It appears to have made my skin look moisturized and I especially like that.  I used this product after a hot steamy shower so it immediately emulsified my skin making my skin feel silky and smooth.  One Hyaluronic Acid benefit is that id doe&#x27;s help delay the aging process and can help to further delay fine lines and wrinkles.  This is what sold me on this product.  The visible benefits is what ant woman desires and with this product came just that.  It is dye free and that means it does not have those skin dyes that dry out your skin. I would say if you are looking for a visable difference try this product and enjoy the radiant youthfulness of it.</li>
    <li> Great serum that delivers quick results. I have less fine lines each day and reduction in age spots. It&#x27;s a light serum and I love this brand. One of the best I&#x27;ve tried!!!!! :)</li>
    <li> So for a product to be bold enough to claim results in 30 seconds, THAT I have to see for myself.  I tested this item for review purposes after getting it at a promotional rate.  Was it really going to make a difference in 30 seconds?  I had heard on Dr. Oz that for any product to plump up the skin instantly it was due to something in the product irritating the skin and forcing water to the area to ward off whatever chemical just entered the cells.  That was my suspicion with this product but after researching Hyaluronic Acid, I now understand that it is not an irritant, it is designed to draw moisture to the area naturally.  In fact they even use hyaluronic acid in cataract surgeries to bring moisture to the eye.  Ok.  Now relieved over the safety issue, I tested it out.  It DID plump out the fine lines I have and it DID do it in around 30 seconds.  It even reduced that line between my brows a little bit.  It did not fully eliminate it but to be fair that area needs something heavy duty like Botox to completely go away.  So, it did what it says it does.  I do use it every day since the results are not permanent but for what it does, it is pretty good.  If this is of interest to you, then this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Uptown Cosmetics because all the products I&#x27;ve tried for them are accurate to description and deliver notable changes. The 50x Strength Hyaluronic Acid is not any different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other brands, Uptown truly stands up to its promise. This product claims you can notice a difference in 30 seconds, and it is absolutely true. Now, this doesn&#x27;t mean that wrinkles will vanish from your face in 30 seconds, but you will definitely feel a smoother skin on your face, the skin feels like if has been tightened, and the skin looks plumper. Over a period of 2 weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed fine lines on my forehead steadily disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smooth Application&lt;br /&gt;Airy formula, only a small ammount covers a great area&lt;br /&gt;Feels skin feeling immediately refreshed&lt;br /&gt;Absorbed Fast&lt;br /&gt;The Company offers a 100% satisfaction guarantee&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend! Although I received this at a small discount, I will continue to purchase this great product as soon as I run out.</li>
    <li> I loved how I was able to get all 3 uptown products the 50 strength hyaluronic acid moisturizing sirum is a great way to help protect and keep up your face. I love trying new products for my facell to keep it firm and hydrated and looking young.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product for a great discount to review and give my unbiased opinion and review.</li>
    <li> This hyaluronic acid formula is unlike any other I&#x27;ve tried in the past! It is AMAZING! I love that it&#x27;s all natural and a simple formula with only 6 ingredients. The effects are noticible right away. You can immediately feel the &amp;#34;plumping action&amp;#34; and it works well to fill in the finer lines on my face. Not in an unnatural botox way but just as if we had turned back the clock a couple years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically only use this in the mornings after cleansing and toning. I did try at night the first night but it seems to leave me sweaty and oily  feeling when I wake up.Applying it in the mornings only seems to be just right for my normal but ultra sensitive skin type. I use it after derma rolling as well but that&#x27;s only a once a month routine and will take me a few months before I can claim any results or not with that. Logically though it seems like if it can do this for my face in a few minutes I&#x27;m sure the added benefit of the derma rolling will be astounding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula does not leave me greasy if I use it at the beginning of my day and my face feels baby soft after it soaks in. It is a little heavier than some others but it absorbs quickly and a little goes a long way. I like the pump style dispenser, it means no unscrewing and no accidental spillage. I&#x27;m very very pleased with the results I&#x27;m seeing and especially at this price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive my bottle free for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience and honest opinions after using this product myself.</li>
