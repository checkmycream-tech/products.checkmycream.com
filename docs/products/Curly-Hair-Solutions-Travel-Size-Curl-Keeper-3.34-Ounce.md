      <li>I received a sample of this product int Birchbox a few months ago and loved it.</li>
      <li>When I first used it I put way to much which made my hair crunchy.</li>
      <li>It seems like a really in-high demand curl product with rave reviews on NaturallyCurly,</li>
      <li>It made my hair really knotty and took forever for me to comb out the knots in the shower, even after using conditioner.</li>
      <li>I have very curly frizzy hair and this product did nothing for me.</li>
      <li>You do not need much of this product.</li>
      <li>For a product to cause this much it should do everything it says.</li>
      <li>and it really didn&#x27;t feel like it was adhering to my hair; I might have used too much because I couldn&#x27;t feel it coating.  </li>
      <li>This product did absolutely nothing for my curls.</li>
      <li>So far, It is only okay.</li>
      <li>I used more then half of the bottle</li>
      <li>and as I&#x27;m getting older, thinning.  </li>
      <li>If you use just enough your curls will be super curly and stay curly for a couple of days (if you know how to take care of your curls when sleeping).</li>
      <li>but I needed to apply a moisturizer on top of using it so my hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry and brittle the next day.  </li>
      <li>The greatest,especially if you live in a humid area</li>
      <li>Finally, one that really fits the bill!  </li>
      <li>I have been seeking out a solution to make my hair less frizzy, better curls, and not flat.</li>
      <li>It makes my curls look shiny soft and bouncy with no frizz.</li>
      <li>This is not a heavy duty styling gel</li>
      <li>It gives volume and curl at first, but later on it just relaxes and my hair actually gets frizzy.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t work for my natural low porosity, 4a, protein sensitive hair.</li>
      <li>Lots of people love this product, it did not work for my 3B,C hair (thick, coarse, coily curls).  </li>
      <li>I get extra curly hair that is soft, not crunchy or frizzy or sticky and even after sleeping on it overnight, all I have to do is rewet my hair</li>
      <li>I let it air dry and was pleasantly surprised by the end results.  </li>

    <li> My hair is curly, but fine and as I&#x27;m getting older, thinning.  I have had some 30 years of looking for good products that enhance the curl with little to no styling.  Finally, one that really fits the bill!  This is not a heavy duty styling gel though.&lt;br /&gt;After I wash my hair, I put about a nickel sized puddle in my palm, rub my hands together, lean forward and grab handfuls of hair then let go.  I don&#x27;t comb it through, not even with my fingers.  Then I just let my hair air dry.  I get extra curly hair that is soft, not crunchy or frizzy or sticky and even after sleeping on it overnight, all I have to do is rewet my hair and it still works the same!  I love that this is so light and it&#x27;s water based.  This stuff is perfect for wash and wear curly hair.</li>
    <li> You do not need much of this product. When I first used it I put way to much which made my hair crunchy. If you use just enough your curls will be super curly and stay curly for a couple of days (if you know how to take care of your curls when sleeping). Also, I have thin really curly hair and this product gave me the appearance of fuller thicker hair.</li>
    <li> This product did absolutely nothing for my curls. It was recommended to me via naturallycurly.com. It didn&#x27;t hold the or define the curl. It is not a Curl Keeper.</li>
    <li> Best ever for 2nd day curls!  Activates with a little water.  I&#x27;ve been using this for years and must have it in my house at all times.</li>
    <li> I have been seeking out a solution to make my hair less frizzy, better curls, and not flat. So far, It is only okay.</li>
    <li> This is repeat purchase of this item and I use it daily. Works great on my curly hair. Came on time and well packaged</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my natural low porosity, 4a, protein sensitive hair. But it did give good hold &amp; curl definition, but made my hair feel very brittle the next day.</li>
    <li> This has a very light hold. it did not work for my frizzy curly hair. I will continue with my p.mitchell super clean gel.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It makes my curls look shiny soft and bouncy with no frizz. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I attempted to buy this product from Curl Mart at NaturallyCurly.com, however, they are never in stock.  It seems like a really in-high demand curl product with rave reviews on NaturallyCurly, so I broke down and ordered it from Amazon.  It is a very light weight, water based product.  I followed the instructions, but felt like I wasn&#x27;t putting enough on my hair.  I just couldn&#x27;t tell if my hair liked this stuff.  It does not coat like a cream-based curl product and it really didn&#x27;t feel like it was adhering to my hair; I might have used too much because I couldn&#x27;t feel it coating.  I let it air dry and was pleasantly surprised by the end results.  Great hold, nice shine, curls look moisturized and healthy.  I have long, 3c hair texture.  I like the results.  I will use this sparingly because of the cost.  Also, the Amazon seller AVEYOU shipped quickly, packaged nicely, and they included a coupon for my next order, plus their shipping rate is much better than curlmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update--This product works and I still like it but I needed to apply a moisturizer on top of using it so my hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry and brittle the next day.  See my review on Mizani Coconut souffle.  Using that in combination with curl keeper and my curls look great and feel moisurized.</li>
    <li> Does not work well with my hair.  It gives volume and curl at first, but later on it just relaxes and my hair actually gets frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it recurls my hair if I rewet it with my hands and scrunch.  But, jeez, I was having to do that all the time.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think my hair reacts well to products with polyquats in it.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product int Birchbox a few months ago and loved it. It wasn&#x27;t sticky, and it made my hair look great. I bought this bottle thinking that the same thing was going to happen. The product was sticky and didn&#x27;t work like the other stuff. It made my hair really knotty and took forever for me to comb out the knots in the shower, even after using conditioner. I don&#x27;t know if the product had expired or if it is a fake product, but I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Lots of people love this product, it did not work for my 3B,C hair (thick, coarse, coily curls).  Made it frizzier, which some products seem to.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for curly hair.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years, and it has never let me down.  A friend of mine calls it my potion for magic hair.  Applying this over conditioner, I don&#x27;t get frizz, but I do get great curls; and if I need to restyle my hair, all it takes is water.</li>
    <li> it hold your hair, my culrs are 3a 3b ish and its good lieght wieght i wish there was more of a hold and defintion but this help keep it not really helping with frizzes but maybe i using it wrong&lt;br /&gt; I use it after applying argan oil to damp hair and then diffuse or air dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;on time! cheap!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  It not only controls my frizz but also doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it feel like cardboard. I love it.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely fabulous. I have finally found a hair care product to control my curly hair when it frizzes. I love this product!</li>
    <li> Left my hair feeling crunchy and caused dryness of the scalp. Has a strong scent that I found over powering.</li>
    <li> I have fine natural curly hair which needs help to stay curly and frizz free this product rates below many other ones I have used</li>
    <li> The greatest,especially if you live in a humid area</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! I have short, 3b/3c hair that has a mind of its own. I use this on the frizzy parts of my hair, and even for second day hair..Just add a little water to hair, apply this Curl Keeper, and go! A LITTLE goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This product holds gorgeous curls without being crunchy. I love that it is water-based and doesn&#x27;t build up on my hair.</li>
    <li> I have very curly frizzy hair and this product did nothing for me. I used more then half of the bottle and it still didn&#x27;t do well I had to use my other products. For a product to cause this much it should do everything it says. Safe your money</li>
