<li> This Milk and Honey refill is expensive for what it is.  </li>
<li> Those dry my hands out terribly.</li>

    <li> great to be able to refill dispensers that are kept sink-side</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite scent for liquid hand soap. It is a bit pricey and I&#x27;m on a budget so I didn&#x27;t buy it often. This soap has a very sweet and enticing scent, but it also keeps your hands soft and isn&#x27;t drying at all. The honey and milk protein definitely plays it part. The only thing I wish it was less expensive because it really has everything I love for in hand soap. I might be cheap, but I think $14 for this is a bit too much. The little 7 oz ones cost around $2.00 and you would think that getting a bulk item would make it cost less. When I bought this I only saved about $2.00. Not a big discount, but kind of what I expect when I buy online.</li>
    <li> Good price. Great packaging to make sure nothing leaked. Happy to find this product!</li>
    <li> Great service.  I have used this refill previously and really like it.  I simply refill the small dispenser when needed.  The soap has a nice clean smell.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this scent for a while.  I used to get it so I stocked up on it</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how good this soap was until I was using a popular bath and body line of soaps. Those dry my hands out terribly. So I switched back to using this again and my hands don&#x27;t feel so horrible after washing anymore. This is a great soap for all areas of the house!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin especially on my hands, this doesn&#x27;t dry my hands out at all, foams well and rinses clean. It smells mildly sweet but not overpowering and the scent does not linger. Other soaps seem to dry my hands out horribly but this one doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s the only hand soap I will use.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It is very moisturizing to the hands. Does not leave them feeling dry like some other hand soaps do.</li>
    <li> It smells so good. Just like warm milk and honey. It&#x27;s great for winter skin and leaves hands smelling great and feeling softer.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hand and body soap. I like the smell and how smooth it makes my skin feel.</li>

    <li> no more chapped hands. get clean without the burn</li>
    <li> I bought many soaps from Softsoap brand and by far this is the best one of them all here  .</li>
    <li> This product was what I expected. The large container was generously price. I will be purchase this product again soon.</li>

    <li> Purchased this item because I absolutely love the scent. However when the product arrived and I opened it, it was to find that the top hadn&#x27;t been on all the way and much of the soap had leaked out. Hopefully this was a freak occurrence in the company&#x27;s packing department.</li>
    <li> I like the liquid soaps much better than a bar of soap. The sink area looks much better and less messy and the liquids do an excellent job.</li>
    <li> This Milk and Honey refill is expensive for what it is.  Hand soap.  I&#x27;m glad to find it on Amazon but I doubt I&#x27;ll spend the money again purchasing.</li>
