<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> used under moisture plums skin great product for th price</li>
    <li> I uses this product after peels, around the eyes,  and in the summer for extra moisture after exposure to the sun...  It works for me.  My face looks well hydrated all year around.</li>
    <li> Nice and thick.  Pure Hyaluronic Acid.  Absorbs well.</li>
    <li> I am a pharmaceutical writer, and work with products that contain hyaluronic acid (HA). HA is injected into the knees of patients with osteoarthritis to ease symptoms such as pain and lack of function. It&#x27;s also sold, apparently, to remove signs of aging. However, &amp;#34;there is no evidence to support the claim that taking it by mouth or applying it to the skin can prevent changes associated with aging.&amp;#34; I tried it for 2 months just to test the theory and saw no difference at all. Sorry folks. I didn&#x27;t give it one star because I don&#x27;t hate it. It just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Good product so far.timely delivery.</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE!! THIS IS ONLY 1% HYALURONIC ACID&lt;br /&gt;The actual bottle contains the following ingredients&lt;br /&gt;exactly as listed in order on the bottle/box: Water, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amazon listing description says &amp;#34;100% Pure Hyaluronic Acid&amp;#34; making you think it&#x27;s actually 100% Hyaluronic Acid, however, when you look at the ingredients printed on the box, among other ingredients (mainly it says Hyaluronic Acid 1% (That 1% is 100% pure Hyaluronic Acid - THAT&#x27;S IT) It&#x27;s likely meant to be misleading and or deceitful in their advertisement, making one think the entire contents of the bottle is 100% Hualuronic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, that being said, it&#x27;s not a terrible product, you&#x27;re just not getting what you think you&#x27;re getting - mainly the super high percentage of hyaluronic acid.  I saw the price tag and had immediate skepticism because of the super low price...but I thought I&#x27;d just get it to try it, just in case - but nope...I&#x27;m a synic to a fault but damnit, I&#x27;m usually right :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed it into my bottle of moisturizer and it blended well, but to be honest, I don&#x27;t notice ANY difference in the level of moisturization of my skin compared to the regular moisturizer I mixed it with. I think the 1% Hyaluronic Acid is just nowhere near enough to be effective. I guess I&#x27;ll go back to paying $40 for my regular brand that has a legitimate 75% hyaluronic acid and feels freaking amazing compared to this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 1 Star review is because I feel this company is very misleading with their advertisement and description of the product. They&#x27;ll probably sell a ton more and still make a zillion dollars but they did not fool ME.</li>
    <li> This is one of the ingrediants I use to make my own face serum. Everyone compliments my 85 yr. old skin!</li>
    <li> I have had dry sensitive skin all my life. I have been using this for almost a week and my face is so soft and not red anymore its amazing!</li>
    <li> I use this for myself and my clients. It&#x27;s an awesome way to hydrate the skin. And it is perfect for oily people. Oily skin still needs hydration but, it doesn&#x27;t need thick creamy moisturizer. If you are oily apply this and a sunscreen and you are on your day for the day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  it doesn&#x27;t really work.  It just dry up your skin.</li>
    <li> Dermatologist told me to use a moisterizer on face because of excessive drying from acne meds.  Decided to try this after seeing a review on Dr. Oz about this chemical and its benefits to skin.  Use it once a day, is not greasy at all, and over time has reduced dryness and winkling.  A plus has been near eradication of adult acne to the point that I only use over the counter Benzl-peroxide once a day.  As a guy, I do not like the typical cosmedic stuff with oils and grease that are popular with the ladies, so this was an option I thought might fit better. No scent either.  Dries fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I see that some people take oral forms of this acid.  Commenters have pointed out that there is a higher cancer risk with this.  I did some research and found that short chain Hyaluronic acids have been found in higher concentrations where there is cancer metastisis (cancer cells migrating to other body parts), so I personally would not eat any of it unless the benefits outweighed the risk.  Topicals have been used by Docs for various skin issues for many years, so I consider those safer.  On the plus side, research has found that very long chain versions appear to protect against cancer in certain mole rat species.  This is a fasinating molecule that appears to do different things at a cellular level depending on the length of the molecular chain.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me, i got little rush on my skin, no redness just light rash.  Maybe because I used it after the Needle Roller Therapy !  (but needle therapy was great) but they don&#x27;t work well together on my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no stranger to skin care, having used Retin-A, DMAE and DIY C serums, chemical peels, etc. and i even take Hyaluronic Acid internally (capsules for skin, joints)and i expected this serum to greatly enhance the moisturizers i was using and give me \\&quot;glowing\\&quot; skin like it seems a lot of the reviewers are getting. I tried different applications but all with the same result, very mattified, dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emailed the company asking politely if they had instructions on application and that maybe i needed to apply differently and i received NO response and that above all doesn&#x27;t sit well with me, if a company has no time to respond to their customers inquiries, and i was polite... so yea that nixes it for me with that company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wished the serum could have worked for me, maybe i will persist with an HA serum from another company.</li>
    <li> I love love this stuff!  Ever since I started using it my face is clear of acne.  I had extremely oily skin - no more.  My skin is smoother and the pores are less noticeable!  Great buy for the price!</li>
    <li> Love this product use it daily</li>
    <li> Its the same thing as the others, but the bottle seemed bigger and it was cheaper. Will buy again if this does the trick</li>
    <li> Has a nice silky feel that spreads well, you don&#x27;t have to use too much,just a few drops. Did not make me break out, which happens to me allot.&lt;br /&gt;I think it is working really well!</li>
    <li> I actually bought this as an add on item after reading the other reviews.  I do put this serum on last in the morning after moisturizers, and then put my make up on top of it.  Since I&#x27;ve been using this I haven&#x27;t had the need to use powder or worry about excess oil on my face.  Not only does this serum smooth my skin, it makes me less greasy too.  It&#x27;s a double benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Often I&#x27;ll just put this on and not put any make up over it since it gives my skin a matte, smooth look.  I&#x27;ll definitely continue buying this ;-)</li>
    <li> Very good &amp; a great value!! I&#x27;ve tried a variety of brands with this one being in my top 2 favorites. It has helped my complexion, works well under makeup &amp; I think actually improves the look of my foundation.</li>
    <li> I love Timeless and also own the Vitamin C serum. I love them both! Hyalouronic acid is wonderful to use after a peel for moisture. I also use it on my eyes in the morning, or anytime I need it. My eyes look a lot more refreshed, not tired. You need only a few drops.&lt;br /&gt; Great product and worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit : on second bottle and now I use it every morning and night. Keeps skin plumped. I stopped using all other moisture products on my skin and it is 100% clear and moist. Keeps your face looking like it just had a peel. Awesome!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know this type of product was available over the counter.  It made my skin feel more firm.  I like the product.</li>
    <li> I love it!!!!! This is the second time I bought it, I will buy it again. Must have One!</li>
    <li> Did not notice any difference. The reviews are good but I have not proven this product!</li>
    <li> Also feels very cooling on my feet which get hot a lot. Helps excellently with dry and crepey skin to make it look and feel younger and softer.</li>
    <li> Love the product, friends are noticing the difference in my skin.  They are wondering if I had any work done???</li>
    <li> I like it.  I trying to get rid of the fine lines under my eyes and it seems to work well.  It help with the dry skin.</li>
    <li> I bought it on the advice of friends .. Will buy it again and I would recommend it my friends</li>
    <li> I just got this stuff yesterday and I&#x27;m hooked already! I put it on last night before bed and woke to great results, but I should have as I had a facial and microdermabraision yesterday. BUT I also put i on my hands they have been dry and old looking for awhile as I wash my hands 10-20 times a day. I rubbed a few drops into my hands then some lotion, and when I woke up this morning they were MUCH softer and smoother looking!</li>
    <li> I use just 5 drops, after I spray water all over my face !  I use this just before my serum, and it feels like a moisture bath for the face!  Hyaluronic acid seals in many times it weight in water!</li>
    <li> I cannot believe the power of this serum not only on my face but even minor cuts.&lt;br /&gt;Rapid healing of skin &amp; am very surprised this is not used in hospital setting for burns.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.. Help with fine lines and also puffy eyes.  I wear it night and day. I use it with my moisturizer:</li>
    <li> Great stuff and usinging as suggested by reviews of the product.</li>
    <li> This truly does noticeable tighten you pores.  When I used it at least every other night I do see a difference in my skin, its clear and refreshed looking.</li>
    <li> It really makes your skin look fantastic.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic! It soothes, super hydrates; it leaves my skin feeling dewy and soft. Professional results!</li>
    <li> I am amazed at how quickly this made a change in my skin. After only 3 days use I have received 2 complements about my skin. I am one that is always looking for the next best skin care and natural ingredients. This will remain on my list of things to keep on hand.</li>
    <li> I love it!  Works great!</li>
    <li> I mixed it with my Garnier Frutise moisturizer and it works very well in keeping my skin moisturized and gives it a nice glow.  I love to wear it under makeup.</li>
    <li> Using it with derma wand. Looking better.. used 5 times and yes I see a change! Will update in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Bought two kinds and this is by far better than the other bottle. Great price, great product. Great for hydration.</li>
    <li> It has really helped with the wrinkles.  I put it on under my foundation and at night.  I use it with the hyaluronic acid cream and the High frequency D&#x27;Arsonval</li>
    <li> I was so impressed with this serum that I have ordered the 8 oz refill size before I run out of the 1 oz! Some of the other reviewers mentioned that this seemed to dry out their skin, but if you do as others have suggested and put moisturizer on right after using it you should see almost instant results.&lt;br /&gt;The bags under my eyes became less visible, my skin looks more refreshed and hydrated. One of the other reviews stated about this should not be used on the lips, but I use it to help plump up my lips and make them look fuller. You just have to put lip balm on top of it to lock in the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;I am 52 years old and have been looking for something that would actually make a difference in my ageing skin, and this is it. I plan to keep using it forever!</li>
    <li> I use this every night before I apply Estee Lauder&#x27;s Advanced Night Repair serum. Really makes it absorb and work better! Will keep using this every night! Does not make my sensitive skin break out.</li>
    <li> This is a great product alone or used with the Hydrating Cream. The product is light and does not sting my eyes. I am 46 years old with dry skin. Without this product I would really look my age!</li>
    <li> Frankly, it didn&#x27;t really seem to make any difference at all.</li>
    <li> Provides a moisture barrier, as it should. However, I do not see a change in my skin. The only significant improvement has only been when I put nothing on my skin...go figure. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This naturally occurring moisturizer serves as an excipient for other moisturizers laid on top.  It is so lightweight, easily absorbed and leaves the skin soft and supple.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and nicely packaging.  But like some of the previous reviews have stated &amp;#34;no directions&amp;#34; one how to apply or use this item. It would have been nice to have one.</li>
    <li> I use this in some facial sprays I make. So far so good. I&#x27;m likin&#x27; it.</li>
    <li> I love the way this product makes my skin feel.  It seems to really hold in the moisture which is great for this cold time of year.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I use this product often.  It keeps my skin moisturized.  I don&#x27;t have wrinkles at age 67. I believe it helps a lot.</li>
    <li> I USE IT IN MY FACE CREAMS AND LOTIONS</li>
    <li> I have just started using Hyaluronic Acid Serum , so far I like the product. Purchased this because of other reviews that I read and I can tell a difference in my complexion.  Would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Not 100% pure - contains alcohol. I returned it immediately when I saw the actual ingredients.</li>
    <li> Good product, I&#x27;ve been using for about three weeks now and I&#x27;m noticing great changes in my skin.  Smaller pores, clearer skin...</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;ve finally found a product that works and makes my skin look good and younger. At my age that&#x27;s a lot. Thank you so much</li>
    <li> Made my skin super plump and I loooooved that... my frown lines were noticeably less pronounced after just a week of use, but I don&#x27;t think my skin likes hyaluronic acid, as it made me break out.  Multiple pimples, some cystic- I never get breakouts, its very uncharacteristic for my skin.  Once I eliminated this product from my skincare routine, though, the problem cleared up in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up giving the remainder of the product to my mom, who had no such negative reaction and happens to really like the results.  Not for me, though.</li>
    <li> A MUST HAVE !!!!! As you are Microneedling you must have this as it infuses and hydrates you skin .. It helps the derma pen glide as you are Microneedling</li>
    <li> Me and my wife both use this and it definitely helps with fine lines and wrinkles. It makes our skin look and feel more hydrated. Love you this...</li>
    <li> I believe this is hydrating my skin.  It does look plumper.  I think it if working,</li>
    <li> It arrived empty..had leaked into the box  Its hard to rate something that is not there  dont know how to get credit for it</li>
    <li> I noticed a great improvement in my fine lines the first week!!!! I love the cost and I love how efficient this company is that I buy the product from!!!! I Play a lot of tennis and I am older so my legs look scaly... I used it on the front of my legs and what a great improvement!!! You can even see a line at the side showing a difference in the skin tones:) I love this product!!!!!</li>
    <li> I stared using this under my moisturizing cream day and night. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the miracle others say but I guess time will tell.  i do like that it&#x27;s non greasy and blends into my skin almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;i think it&#x27;s a great price and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t seem to have the impact other reviewers discussed, despite my following their directions.  Perhaps it is only good for some types of skin.</li>
    <li> perfect for my vitamin c serum</li>
    <li> Got it because it said in the ad &amp;#34;the purest of pure&amp;#34; or something of the kind, like, we are the best among all others. After a few uses, wanted to tell the seller, Relax guys, you are not the best. This is by far NOT the best hyaluronic serum out there. Did not notice as good results as I notice with other brands. So no, this one is not the best, sorry.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Honestly, can see a difference with first application!?</li>
    <li> Just the price went up</li>
    <li> If it works it must be on the microscopic level because I can&#x27;t see a difference.Maybe they all do the se thing.  :(</li>
    <li> So far I have noticed a difference in the appearance of my blackheads on and around my nose and chin. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!I am acne prone and i apply this after cleansing and applying benzoyl peroxide.I dont really need a rich moisturizer since i have oily skin,but this just adds a little bit to make my skin supple and keeps it from that tight feeling and makes my skin glow!Does not break me out at all.I dont really have any wrinkles other then a very fine one on my forehead and it had faded noticeably.Glad i discovered this and plan to repurchase.On a side note,this,along with dudu osun black soap and a 2.5% benzoyl peroxide lotion and a little castor oil as an eye moisturizer has made my 32 year old  skin look better then it probaly ever has!</li>
    <li> HA is the bset skin care one can buy, It plumps up wrinkles, if you have any and assists moisutrizer to hold longer!</li>
    <li> Put it all over your clean face and neck.Wait a few minutes and you can add other&lt;br /&gt;products if you want. But first time, do just this serum and go to bed. I looked so&lt;br /&gt;rested and pink,like I&#x27;d been asleep for a week.</li>
    <li> The order arrived only 2 days after i placed the order. Amazing! I have been using it for two days and can already notice my skin smother. I will definitely buy this item again</li>
    <li> Quality product. Great price. Shipped quickly</li>
    <li> Been using this for 2 weeks now so far see no difference. It gets absorbed into the skin so fast but then it leaves the skin really dry, I must immediately add my moisturiser on  top.  So far see no difference maybe too early to tell. Will update again in some weeks.</li>
    <li> works on hair, shin and face.  wonderfully priced and I will never go without it again</li>
    <li> I have used hylauronic acid before and this is not quite the same consistency  and texture.  I am not sure what I got. Which is why I should have purchased it from a professional source and not online.</li>
    <li> I have been using this every day for about a year &amp; before this product I had skin that was dry &amp; oily with lots of acne. Now my skin is what I would consider balanced &amp; breakouts rarely happen &amp; when they do its only one or two rather then my whole face. Id recommend this product! im happy i stumbled across this product.</li>
    <li> A friend introduced me to this product almost two years ago and it&#x27;s made such a huge difference in my skin.  I use it along with my regular moisturizer. It allows everything to absorb so much better. Before using this, I used to have uneven blotchy and sometimes dry skin. I was also starting to get fine lines on my face.  When I use a heavier cream to correct the dry skin I would breakout. It was a vicious cycle. I&#x27;ve recommended this to all of my friends. They&#x27;ve also reported great results!</li>
    <li> Greyhound dogs tend to have very sensitive skin and toes, and they get painful pointy corns right in the toe pads. The treatment for the corns basically is to hydrate them out of the toe pad with a special cream, but it requires that you use H.Acid to get the toe pads nice and soft first. The stuff from the vet was $45 per ounce!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it can make my dog&#x27;s hard cracked toes soft and supple as a newborn puppy&#x27;s, it&#x27;s going to do wonders for your own dry skin. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t irritate, so I can save $35 in the course of his treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took one star off for the nondescript packaging.  If the bottle said what it was used for or had a brief instruction sentence, it would be a 5-star product.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  My skin feels so much softer.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this several times. I like the formula and the price is right.</li>
    <li> I HAVE NEVER USED THIS PRODUCT UNTIL NOW, I LOVE IT, YOUR SKIN FEELS SO SOFT WHEN YOU APPLY THIS TO YOUR SKIN. I ORDERED TWO AND WILL ORDER MORE BECAUSE ITS HAS NOW BECOME THE BEST LOTION FOR MY SKIN. THANK YOU SELLER.</li>
    <li> Reading the reviews, I thought this might be too good to be true, but for $10, why not. Best $10 I spent. It arrived quickly and I saw an immediate difference in my skin texture and moisture level after just one application. I hope it gets rid of the stubborn brown spots for me like it did for Araceli Bolanos. As an added bonus, this serum is used in a lot of lip plumping products, too.</li>
    <li> I use this along with argan oil, it&#x27;s made a huge change in my skin! I mix a few drops of both and apply to clean skin, then follow with my cetaphil moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with the results. The effects are visiably noticable within a few minutes. They call HA face lift in a bottle It really is true. This product is very nicely priced and  with free shipping as an added bonus..</li>
    <li> I use it every night and once a week with the derma roller ....Great !! Mixed a few drops in my lip gloss. Moisture moisture is good. I also use it before serums and night time moisturizers</li>
    <li> I bought this after viewing the reviews here. I have been using it for about a month, and it makes my face soft initially, but by the end of the day it is dry and flaky. I am 40, very fair skin and it is always very very dry.  So I started to use this in conjunction with my moisturiser. My face was so dry, it was breaking out. Now I still use the serum, but for a totally different purpose. I use it once a week like a mini peel.</li>
    <li> I used this product last night in conjunction with my newly acquired derma roller and although i&#x27;m a little skeptical as to wether or not its 100% hylauronic acid as it states this serum made my skin feel smooth,hydrated and completely rejuvenated without leaving an oily residue.This product is a must have!!</li>
    <li> It makes my skin glow, so soft and smooth. It is a great product and the price is amazing for the results.</li>
    <li> Non smell..&lt;br /&gt;Works best after a peel treatment&lt;br /&gt;very smooth once applied to the skin..&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be ordering more in the future..</li>
    <li> I am a 30 year old male who&#x27;s struggled with bad skin my entire teenage and adult life. And I&#x27;ve tried just about everything on the market to combat my skin problem..But 8 weeks ago I learned about OCM \\&quot;Oil, Cleansing, method\\&quot; And it went against everything I even knew about skin care. But I tried it. And within the first 24 hours I could already see and feel a huge difference. But with OCM there&#x27;s a lot of different options in products you can use. As for me, I found that castor oil is the best face wash...I was having trouble finding a moisturizer though. And then someone mentioned two products to me..First one being CeraVe pm and this hyaluronic acid. And with these three products are combined in a nightly routine. Magic happens!..It use to take me days to recover from a rough shave, scabby face, redness, overly dry or overly oily skin...Now my skin is virtually spotless, And if I do accidentally cut myself shaving, The scab now heals overnight! My skin feels great any time of the day or night....I honestly don&#x27;t know what I would of done if I had not found OCM and the three products mentioned in this review...So, I give this serum 5 stars! In conjunction with castor oil and CeraVe pm, It is by far the best skin care team I&#x27;ve ever seen or tried!</li>
    <li> Almost finished the bottle and not sure if it did anything. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been applying this product for several weeks now, and think I might see just a wee bit of improvement on some of the lesser wrinkles. The deep ones look the same with no visible improvement.</li>
    <li> I use this just before applying the Timeless Vitamin C + E Ferulic  Acid Serum  in the mornings after I wash my face and I think it helps with my antiaging routine. It lasts a long time, and doesn&#x27;t sting.</li>
    <li> Hyaluronic acid helps to retain moisture.  Works well, great price.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT KEEPS MY SKIN HYDRATED UNDER ANY PRODUCT I PUT OVER IT!</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and feels nice, but really has no affect. Explore other products.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, my skin drinks it right up. I&#x27;m on my second bottle. I use it every morning after I wash up and go on with my usual routine. I used this at night as well prior to using tretinoin cream. It definitely helps my skin from drying out too much and doesn&#x27;t clog my overly sensitive pores. Definitely give this a chance.</li>
    <li> Love it! I bought this size for travel and have been using this product for over a year. I also bought the 8 oz size for refill</li>
    <li> I got a facial and the esthetician recommended I buy some hyaluronic acid serum for $70. I had never heard of it, wasn&#x27;t going to spend $70, and besides - it has &amp;#34;acid&amp;#34; in the name. So I went home and googled it, and lo and behold, you can find it for $10 and it works great as a supplement to moisturizer! I put it underneath moisturizer and it makes my skin feel smooth and &amp;#34;plumped out.&amp;#34; This is a great product. No reason to spend $70 for a brand name version.</li>
    <li> I have bought this brand faithfully for almost a year now. I am never disappointed with the quality of this serum and use it prior to my moisturizer. It&#x27;s a staple for my beauty routine.</li>
    <li> Such a great product, you just have to try it. I bought it along with the (540 Needles) Derma Micro Needle White Titanium Roller. I&#x27;ve got the chance to use it and It feels great on your face right after using the Derma Micro Needle Roller. I would really recommend it. 5 stars for having such great product.</li>
    <li> If you eat healthy (NO meat or dairy) and drink lots of water. Then this will do wonders for the skin. When I apply on my skin in the morning, everyone seems to notice how my skin looks younger.....</li>
    <li> Love it!  Sincerely, Dixie</li>
    <li> I purchased this about 4 weeks ago to incorporate into a new skin care routine I was establishing aiming at putting more moisture in my skin.  With aging skin, I luckily no longer have breakouts to worry about however my skin has become very discolored, dry and the wrinkles have been settling in very nicely.  I had also started using the Vit C 20% with Ferulic about the same time.  My skin is much brighter (probably more to do with Vit C) and feels very moisturized.  I use this twice daily after toner and Vit C but before moisturizer and would not be without it. I also use this on my neck and decollette.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for about a week now and cannot honestly see any difference, but I am sure it is too soon to tell.  Perhaps after several weeks I&#x27;ll be able to better critique it.  Meanwhile, it does seem soothing and refreshing and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> It ended up breaking my skin out after just a couple of uses.  I have since ordered a brand that does not have the benzoyl alcohol in it, and the new brand does not break it out.  I also found with the use of this brand that with the alcohol in it, it dried my face out really bad, which this acid is supposed to replenish or help retain moisture so it did the opposite of what it&#x27;s supposed to...so I wasted my money because it did not work for me!,,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 to 3 weeks now and have not really noticed any difference yet. Will continue to use it and see if there is any improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> great for lifting up and tighting the face, you can really see the results in a few weeks! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is easier to use and lasts much longer than I had expected.  I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if I knew for sure that it was actually making any difference on the wrinkles, but it feels good on the face and gives the skin a more even, healthy look.  I&#x27;ll buy it again and maybe update the review in a year.  Time will tell.</li>
    <li> apparently my wife ordered this on my account so i cant give any first hand knowledge but i can say that i havent heard her complain about it so i assume she likes it.</li>
    <li> I like this, but prefer the HA with vitamin C. That has even more benefits. No more expensive creams for me</li>
    <li> Spending the summers in Colorado call for more then sunscreen and moisturizer. It helps to trap in the sunscreen and keep my skin from drying out. Love Love Love it</li>
    <li> Really haven&#x27;t seen a major difference and my expectations were not as high as I was hoping for.  But it does feel light on the skin and not a bit sticky or heavy.  I would buy it again just because it penetrates well into the skin without feeling tacky.</li>
    <li> My skin does seem to have improved. My wrinkles are less noticable, especially around my lips. Oderless and absorbes quickly.</li>
    <li> I being using this product every day but I don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;So I can&#x27;t really rate</li>
    <li> make my skin a little dry. maybe I not used it the right wat</li>
    <li> No improvement in skin at all after using it for a few weeks. Very disappointed .</li>
    <li> great stuff for your skin</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel tight, I like it... I don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet, I am using it to prevent them from appearing.</li>
    <li> I seriously love this stuff so much. I&#x27;ve only used it for about a week now but I can already feel the difference in my skin. I like the dropper as well, makes it super conveient. I&#x27;ll totally buy this product again and from this seller. shipping also timely!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work nearly a well as other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  Will be going back to previous brand.&lt;br /&gt;I actually didn&#x27;t see any result at all.  But since I see so many high reviews I figured it must work just not well like others.</li>
    <li> Liked it so much , I reordered dbl the size and 4 more. use it daily</li>
    <li> This product made my shin beak out with small red bumps, not a lot but it was still annoying.  I used it on my face, neck and chest with the results being the same...breakouts! :(&lt;br /&gt;** I am updating my review, as I have sensitive skin so I will change the rating from 2 to 3</li>
    <li> My sister recommended and was right I love it. Great price arrived on time and will be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use this right now, my asthma started up, and I started to itch, so I will give it a rest for now.</li>
    <li> I wanted to give this product a good month of use before I left a review, I am so pleased! My skin is so soft and dewy. I use 3 drops in the morning under my sunscreen, and mix it with my nightime moisturizer before bed. I expected this to make my skin a bit greasy but it hasn&#x27;t. I also recommend Avibon  A313 Pommade..</li>
    <li> Feels like a plain gel. Could not tell anything was there.</li>
    <li> I like this product. Have used it for about a month now, and here is what I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Tightens skin after application. Face feels tight after application. (once you&#x27;re over a certain age, that&#x27;s a good thing!)&lt;br /&gt;~ Great for using after the derma roller. It does not cause noticeable stinging.&lt;br /&gt;~ Experienced no adverse side effects like breakouts and oiliness as another reviewer stated.&lt;br /&gt;~ Apply, then wait for 5 minutes for the product to dry, before using moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  use this in the morning and evening. In the evening I follow with derma e Hyaluronic Acid Night Cr&amp;egrave;me, 2-Ounces . The combination of the two is very nice, and in the morning, my skin feels great. I recommend this, as the price is right and the quality is good.</li>
    <li> Using on my face with my night cream, noticed a difference within a week!!!</li>
    <li> This was my first time using this product.  I use it as an addition to my evening regimen of moisterizing.  It adheres well to my skin and there is no discomfort at all.  I will continue to  use this product as part of my evening moisterizing regimen.  I found that, when I use it with my daytime moisterizing regimen, it tends to leave a flaky residue.  However, as part of my evening regimen, it does not have the same effect.  So, I am very pleased to add this  100% pure moisterizer to my evening regimen of moisterizing.</li>
    <li> I expected a little  more results, after reading all the reviews.  But for me, it wasn&#x27;t as dramatic.  I will continue useing until gone.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product for dry skin.  I use a few drops with my daily nite moisturizer.  Also add 2 drops in my hand cream lotion.  Saw the difference in the texture of my skin in five days.  Highly recommend use for dry skin - very easy to handle, does not leave my skin oily.</li>
    <li> Does what it is intended to do. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Works well love it shipped fast</li>
    <li> Fantastico, lo recomiendo 100%</li>
    <li> Hyaluronic Acid serum is in my daily routine for facial care.  I highly recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> Good product for very nice price. Recommend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a month but don&#x27;t feel much difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I used this product for a few weeks and didnt notice any difference in my skin. This product absorbs easily and is soothing after a peel but I just didn&#x27;t notice anything else. It has great results for some according to other reviews and is not expensive so it might just be my skin.  Didn&#x27;t cause me to break out or anything negative.</li>
    <li> Timeless is my #1 source for skincare serums.  Good seller!</li>
    <li> Forget the local pharmacy beauty section and skip the expensive department stores this product has more of what you want for less money. Say goodbye to crows feet and crepe paper skin in literally an instant.</li>
