      <li>Sebastian&#x27;s great for clubbing, real needed stiff hold, but Joico great for day wear at work</li>
      <li>I used to order Sebastian Re-shaper strong hold, but it can be super sticky.</li>

      <li>I made sure the picture was of the old can</li>

      <li>For my fine, flyaway hair, no hairspray has ever come close to what this one does in holding my hair styles without weighing my hair down.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Joimist Firm for over ten years and have also strayed many times, only to come back to this product.</li>
      <li>far this is the only product that I will use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried to find a bunch of other cheaper hairsprays to use that fit these criteria: 1) hold up to high humidity 2) does not smell bad or strongly 3)</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t combing my hair several times during the day.  so, this spray is great for me, as it holds well, but, you can still comb it out.</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray. It smells great. I can make my hair super duper kinky curly or super duper straight. I only use this stuff when I wear my hair curly b/c it is a bit stiff. Which, I need for my curly hair. But I don&#x27;t like to use it for my straight hair b/c I don&#x27;t need a stiff hairspray for that. Unless I have my hair pulled back and need it to hold. So I guess my point...it&#x27;s a good hold hairspray. :)</li>
    <li> Ive been using this product for years from my salon, I was trying to save money and buy it on line.  Even though the packaging looks the same, ITS NOT.</li>
    <li> Came as expected if not earlier, would and will purchase again.  Works great without being sticky like other hairsprays.  Definately suggest using it.</li>
    <li> This is not the same formula that I received the last time I ordered.  I do not know if this is a reformulated product or a poor knock off!</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and like the way it performs</li>
    <li> I live where it is very hot and humid!  The Texas Gulf Coast!  This spray is awesome.  A little goes a long way.  And my fine, thin hair stays in place ALL day!  How did I ever live without it before now!!??</li>
    <li> Best hairspray ever!!</li>
    <li> I got this product for my wife because she loves it.  Little did I know it was unisex, so I am not sneaking a few spays of my own without her knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She wonders why it goes so fast and I just sit back with beautifully styled hair and smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was looking for good hair spray many years and I purchased to try many company Hairspry.  This company product is very good. I will continue to use the product.</li>
    <li> I use this product to set my hair once i&#x27;ve styled it, works well it has a firm hold, satisified!</li>
    <li> The formula on this product has been changed in the last year but so has the packaging.  I made sure the picture was of the old can but what I received was the new can which has the new formula which I do not like.  Please change your picture!!!  I would not have bought it if I had known.  New formula has &#x27;hold tenue 09&#x27; on the can and writing goes sideways.</li>
    <li> smells great and works great....anyone who likes flexible hold and a pleasant smell will enjoy this product.  Try it today!!!</li>
    <li> For my fine, flyaway hair, no hairspray has ever come close to what this one does in holding my hair styles without weighing my hair down.</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray, but the seller that I purchased this from sent something other than the product I ordered. It was in the Joico container, but it was very obvious not the same produtct. They said that the product was new, but the bar code was all scratched out and the product smelled totally different and was a terrible hairspray. They would not let me return this item due to the rules of shipping flammables.</li>
    <li> The hairspray holds well, but left my hair stiff. I prefer Sexy Hair Concepts Spray and Play hairspray. You can use the product to build in texture, it holds well and you can actually brush through your hair and not have all the build up the Joico spray leaves. Not impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> My favorite hairspray! not sticky or stiff but holds my hair in place all day.</li>
    <li> Terrific service, quick delivery considering it&#x27;s coming fr NY to Honolulu, I was surprised. Also, they took the time to wrap it well.&lt;br /&gt;As for the hairspray, due to high humidity, this hairspray does the job for all day hold. I used to order Sebastian Re-shaper strong hold, but it can be super sticky. Sebastian&#x27;s great for clubbing, real needed stiff hold, but Joico great for day wear at work, school etc.&lt;br /&gt;Joico smelled nicer too, not as poisonous, as some hairsprays are.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried to find a bunch of other cheaper hairsprays to use that fit these criteria: 1) hold up to high humidity 2) does not smell bad or strongly 3) does not flake or leave white residue on your hair 4) firm but yet yields when you brush your hair and does not leave all that flaky white stuff visible on your hair (I have black hair) 5) all day hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far this is the only product that I will use. I&#x27;ve used Joimist Firm for over ten years and have also strayed many times, only to come back to this product.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my hairdresser and I like it very much. It washes out more easily than other hairsprays I&#x27;ve used through the years, so my hair is squeaky clean after a shampoo. It holds a style well, even on my fine textured hair, and doesn&#x27;t have a noticeable fragrance. It seems to be available mostly in salons, so I was happy to have found it on Amazon!</li>
