      <li>Its the best.</li>
      <li>A wonderful eye cream!  </li>
      <li>Good!</li>
      <li>product may do splendidly for puffy eye bags from stress and lack of sleep.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a great consistency that spreads out evenly and absorbs well.</li>
      <li>It feels great going on.</li>
      <li>GREAT PRODUCT</li>
      <li>Great product that I will be purchasing again.</li>
      <li>FANTASTIC!!!</li>
      <li>LOVE IT !!</li>
      <li>and I have had good results with it.  </li>
      <li>It makes me look like I got a really good night of sleep.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product, but I haven&#x27;t gotten rid of puffiness under my eyes.</li>
      <li>This makes it a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It feels really good to apply.</li>
      <li>love this product as good as anything in the department store!</li>
      <li>I ordered this product and a face cream and have been very pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>Amazing product, I could see a difference within days.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, it is a nice under-eye moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I assume the &#x27;cream&#x27; in the title was for advertising and searching purposes, but I found it kind of misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After cleaning your face you pat the gel on  until it absorbs, which it does nicely.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t help with wrinkles, but it&#x27;s effective for me, which is why I&#x27;ve stuck with it over the years.</li>
      <li>Nice texture</li>
      <li>It cooling to the touch and spreads very easily.  </li>
      <li>Again very good results for a reasonably priced product.</li>
      <li>moisturizes OK, nothing spectacular.</li>
      <li>I applied the gel under my eyes as directed and waited for the amazing cooling sensation that many eye creams/gels have.</li>
      <li>Nice, silky texture to it but comes out in quite a bit more than is needed for under two eyes, even with the lightest touch/squeeze.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for the better part of a week</li>
      <li>/&gt;Still, if you just want the moisturizing effect, then it is ok.</li>
      <li>but I like this one and do feel like I look more &amp;#34;refreshed&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I really wasn&#x27;t happy with this eye cream.  </li>
      <li>I was still hopeful that I would wake up with more radiant and rested eyes since the product states &amp;#34;Results:</li>
      <li>It has this silky texture that once massaged in just puts me a bit more at ease.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s safe to use around your eyes, but if it does nothing -- why bother?</li>
      <li>I tend to have reactions to many creams and cosmetics, I&#x27;ve had no adverse reactions to this</li>
      <li>For the price I thought it did a pretty good job.</li>
      <li>Using a light touch, apply this \\&quot;Sleeping Cream\\&quot; to your under-eye area each evening, and soon, you may just feel more like a \\&quot;Sleeping Beauty\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I am giving it 3 stars because I just bought it, so I really can&#x27;t say how good a product it is yet, but I wanted to ask-</li>
      <li>I had been using Juice Beauty Green Apple eye cream which was great for crepey eyelids but not so good for puffy under eye circles.  </li>
      <li>It is not greasy and goes on easily.  </li>
      <li>According to the packaging, I should have seen results after the first application and amazing results &#x27;over time&#x27;.</li>
      <li>It works fine as a moisturizer.</li>
      <li>This little tube contains a cache of excellent ingredients.  </li>
      <li>While it goes on smooth, smells pretty,and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling sticky....</li>
      <li>Nice gel/serum that softens and moisturizes the eye area very well.</li>
      <li>, primarily because of the moisturizing effect.</li>
      <li>I felt that my eyes looked better from the first night.</li>
      <li>Although this is called a cream it is really a gel -- a wonderfully smooth gel that applies smoothly and absorbs easily.  </li>
      <li>I wish everyone could get my good results from the&lt;br /&gt;Ultra-Lift Miracle Sleeping Cream, but we&#x27;re all different.  </li>
      <li>Its more of a gel like substance than a cream and it absorbs really fast.  </li>
      <li>The cream looked okay but doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
      <li>The area is beginning to look brighter and more toned, and that makes my whole face look happier.</li>
      <li>I like this particular eye cream because you get a double whammy - caffeine, which really does depuff eyes, and hyaluronic acid which is excellent for smoothing out wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>A really lovely eye cream and highly recommended.</li>
      <li>ingredients appear to be safe for normal skin</li>
      <li>I have experienced no irritation, but I have definitely seen an improvement in the eye area--less puffy, and soft, smooth skin.</li>
      <li>problem is that a company raises expectations with a product name such as &amp;#34;Ultra-Lift Miracle Sleeping Cream Anti-Age plus Anti-Fatigue Eye Cream&amp;#34; / I&#x27;m always leery when the word &amp;#34;Miracle&amp;#34; is used to describe a product (and frankly, I don&#x27;t even understand how a company is allowed to use that kind of wording in a product name or claim.).&lt;br</li>
      <li>do like the product and will continue to use it since I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>Nice enough but nothing special - and most definitely no miracle.</li>
      <li>I used the Garnier Skin Ultra-Lift Miracle Sleeping Cream for 2 weeks by applying it right before bedtime.</li>
      <li>I have used Garnier products in the past and been pretty happy with them, so I was eager to try this</li>
      <li>First off, this is a gel, not a cream.</li>
      <li>the first couple of times I used it.  </li>
      <li>Saw and could feel it working after the first night.  </li>
      <li>would definitely like my eyes to look better.</li>
      <li>First, it&#x27;s a gel, and NOT a cream, as described.</li>
      <li>My eyes looked exactly like they did before I applied the product.</li>
      <li>First lets take out the word \\&quot;miracle\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>First of all, it kinda feels slimy until it dries.  </li>
      <li>Weird, but it is the best feeling cream I&#x27;ve ever applied under my eyes ...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a clear, unscented gel-cream that applies smoothly and really improves the look and feel of the eye area.</li>
      <li>I think a great deal depends on how serious your own problem is with puffiness and dark circles.</li>
      <li>Anti-Age plus Anti-Fatigue Eye Cream is a pure pleasure to use.</li>
      <li>awakening, I don&#x27;t see the product has made a real difference.</li>
      <li>and I really see a difference ....</li>
      <li>Very good&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and this really works well for me.</li>
      <li>If you accidentally get some on your eye lashes they with get sticky and clump together, often in a way that puts them poking straight into my eyes.  </li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t do much else.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and rarely use makeup.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used the product for a week now and can&#x27;t really see much of a difference.</li>
      <li>Really like this item along with the night creme</li>
      <li>Admittedly, I am not that old, so perhaps it makes a bigger difference where more of a difference is needed.</li>
      <li>It did not have good moisturizing properties (the other big reason to use these creams), my undereye area was not moister after using.</li>
      <li>have tried many other type of eye creams.</li>
      <li>My dark circles are lighter and the fine lines around my eyes have diminished signidicantly!</li>
      <li>I also found the cream to be fairly greasy which is not a pleasant feeling when I&#x27;m getting ready to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This \\&quot;Miracle Sleeping Cream\\&quot; contains Hyaluronic Acid, Caffeine, Essential Oil, Rare Plant Extracts and other ingredients, but it is very gentle and virtually free of scent.</li>
      <li>I have used a few different eye creams, all of which moisturize and make the eyelid skin feel good.</li>
      <li>, seen more improvement with some of the more expensive products I have tried but those products are not in my budget and this product is.  </li>
      <li>Trying to be more diligent about my skin care routine at night and incorporating this really has seemed to help my eyes look less dry and overall better.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend its use to all ages of women.</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for how well it would work.  </li>
      <li>In fact they could not even do as well as a slightly better night&#x27;s sleep for lightening my very dark</li>
      <li>They say it contains essential oil, caffeine, adenosine, hyaluronic acid and rare plant extracts.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have big problems with puffiness and dark circles, so I can&#x27;t comment on how effective this cream is for those problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>&amp; I&#x27;ve seen no improvement in under eye puffiness, dark circles or fine lines.</li>
      <li>I typically prefer gels, so I was fine with that.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I USE THIS EVERY NIGHT I HAVE SEEN A DIFFERENCE IN APPEARANCE OF MY EYES.  GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen the major results this product claims yet, but I&#x27;ll continue using it before making a firm decision.</li>
    <li> Very good&lt;br /&gt;I felt the difference</li>
    <li> My aging skin has thinned with intractable puffiness under my eyes.  I have used this eye gel faithfully since receiving it, but I see no results at all, instant or otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on easily, although it takes some time to be fully absorbed by the skin and is slightly sticky for a few hours.  It&#x27;s not uncomfortable, but it&#x27;s not particularly soothing or refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I find nothing in this gel to recommend my continuing use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE STAR!</li>
    <li> First lets take out the word \\&quot;miracle\\&quot;. No,it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is actually a gel, not a cream.  After cleaning your face you pat the gel on  until it absorbs, which it does nicely. They say it contains essential oil, caffeine, adenosine, hyaluronic acid and rare plant extracts. A list of the ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AQUA/WATER* DIPROPYLENE GLYCOL* DIMETHICONE*GLYCERIN*ALCOHOL DENAT.*BIS-PEG-18 METHYL ETHER DIMETHYL SILANE*VINYL DIMETHICONE/METHICONE SILSESQUIOXANE CROSSPOLYMER*DIMETHICONE CROSSPOLYMER*PEG/PPG/POLYBUTYLENE GLYCOL-8/5/3 GLYCERIN*HYDROXYETHYLPIPERAZINE ETHANE SULFONIC ACID*ADENOSINE*ALBIZIA JULIBRISSIN BARK EXTRACT*ALUMINUM STARCH OCTENYLSUCCINATE*AMMONIUM POLYACRYLD I M E T H Y LTA U R A M I D E / A M M O N I U M POLYACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE* CAFFEINE*CAPRYLYL GLYCOL*CARBOMER* CI 16035/RED 40* CI 19140/YELLOW 5* DARUTOSIDE*LAVANDULA HYBRIDA OIL*PHENOXYETHANOL*PPG-3 MYRISTYL ETHER*SILICA*SODIUM ACRYLATES CROSSPOLYMER-2*SODIUM HYALURONATE*SODIUM POLYACRYLATE*TRIETHANOLAMINE*XANTHAN GUM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of stuff in a tiny little tube. Does it work? meh..I don&#x27;t have a lot of puffiness but have noticed some dryness and crepiness under my eyes. It seems to help the dryness and there is no irritation. Of course everyone, with different problems, will have different results.  It works fine as a moisturizer. Just don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t seen any improvement from using this yet</li>
    <li> I had seen the promotional advertising for Garnier&#x27;s line of \\&quot;Sleeping Cream\\&quot; products, and I was intrigued by the concept. I have to say that the Garnier Skin Ultra-Lift Miracle Sleeping Cream Anti-Age plus Anti-Fatigue Eye Cream is a pure pleasure to use. It&#x27;s a clear, unscented gel-cream that applies smoothly and really improves the look and feel of the eye area. Lack of restful sleep, stress, aging, and allergies have taken a toll on my under-eye area. The rest of my facial skin still has a youthful look, but under my eyes--it&#x27;s a different story. This \\&quot;Miracle Sleeping Cream\\&quot; contains Hyaluronic Acid, Caffeine, Essential Oil, Rare Plant Extracts and other ingredients, but it is very gentle and virtually free of scent. I have experienced no irritation, but I have definitely seen an improvement in the eye area--less puffy, and soft, smooth skin. The area is beginning to look brighter and more toned, and that makes my whole face look happier. Using a light touch, apply this \\&quot;Sleeping Cream\\&quot; to your under-eye area each evening, and soon, you may just feel more like a \\&quot;Sleeping Beauty\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> love this product as good as anything in the department store!</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC!!! I would highly recommend its use to all ages of women.</li>
    <li> First off, this is a gel, not a cream. It is clear and gel-like in texture. I assume the &#x27;cream&#x27; in the title was for advertising and searching purposes, but I found it kind of misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the product for a week now and can&#x27;t really see much of a difference. According to the packaging, I should have seen results after the first application and amazing results &#x27;over time&#x27;. I like the feel of the gel, it is moisturizing, but &#x27;miracle&#x27; it is not. Admittedly, I am not that old, so perhaps it makes a bigger difference where more of a difference is needed. But it does nothing for my dark circles and bags (which it claims it will).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, if you just want the moisturizing effect, then it is ok. But for a miracle you will need to look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> At the age of 31, I am starting to see some lines and wrinkles under my eyes. I have tried a variety of eye creams in the past and I was hoping to find a cheaper, well balanced eye product. Unfortunately, this product is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this product is a gel. It is not a cream. I typically prefer gels, so I was fine with that. I applied the gel under my eyes as directed and waited for the amazing cooling sensation that many eye creams/gels have. Nothing. Darn. I was still hopeful that I would wake up with more radiant and rested eyes since the product states &amp;#34;Results: 1st morning: deeply hydrates, and smoothens the eye area for a rested look.&amp;#34; Nothing. My eyes looked exactly like they did before I applied the product. I still tried it again and again. Night after night. Nothing. I will say that the gel does not make your eyes feel heavy or greasy and it does not seem to run at all. That and it moisturizes a little. Unfortunately, that is where the good aspects of this gel end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel will basically moisturize your skin under the eyes. It won&#x27;t do much else.</li>
    <li> Just started using it.  Noticing a little brighter skin under my eyes.  Will hold judgement for a month or two down the road.  It did burn and turn my skin red the first couple of times I used it.  After that though it stopped burning.  Reminds me of a retinol cream</li>
    <li> This works so well on my eyes, I have only used this for less than a week. So up date later.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the better part of a week and I&#x27;m getting nothing from it. Well, that&#x27;s not true. It feels really good to apply. It has this silky texture that once massaged in just puts me a bit more at ease. Weird, but it is the best feeling cream I&#x27;ve ever applied under my eyes ... if only it worked. I first thought I wasn&#x27;t applying enough. I upped the amount just a bit for the second night on, and still haven&#x27;t seen anything. It&#x27;s not a total fail, it does moisturize under the eyes without giving that greasy look/feel to the skin. But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> do not do anything. Have used for over three weeks with no difference</li>
    <li> I have used Garnier products in the past and been pretty happy with them, so I was eager to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely like my eyes to look better. I have a few wrinkles and some darkness and swelling. My first reaction to this product is that it&#x27;s a pretty small bottle. I also found the cream to be fairly greasy which is not a pleasant feeling when I&#x27;m getting ready to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon awakening, I don&#x27;t see the product has made a real difference. My eyes are still dark and swollen. The skin might be slightly moister, but there was no drastic difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use the product, but at this point I&#x27;m underwhelmed.</li>
    <li> Nice gel/serum that softens and moisturizes the eye area very well. It left the area soft and moisturized. Unlike regular moisturizers used for the rest of the face that sting when in contact with the eyes, THIS doesn&#x27;t sting at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have crow&#x27;s feet nor the cat whisker-y, crinkly-eye wrinkles that go from corner of eyes to the nose. I have puffy morning eyes due to allergies with eye bags. I was hoping for an overnight or at least 7- day miracle. It didn&#x27;t de-puff my allergy bags but the eye area was definitely moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product may do splendidly for puffy eye bags from stress and lack of sleep. I don&#x27;t have a dark circle problem so can&#x27;t report on that portion of effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a nice under-eye moisturizer. I didn&#x27;t see any lifting or miracles.</li>
    <li> I had been using Juice Beauty Green Apple eye cream which was great for crepey eyelids but not so good for puffy under eye circles.  This gel has been working much better and has significantly decreased the marshmallows under my eyes.  It cooling to the touch and spreads very easily.  Sadly, it doesn&#x27;t do much for the dark circles under my eyes or my crepey eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(sigh) I have no trouble finding eye creams that work on 1 problem (dark circles, puffiness, crepey dry lids) but I can&#x27;t seem to find anything that can tackle all 3 signs of aging around the eyes and do it well.</li>
    <li> I really wasn&#x27;t happy with this eye cream.  First of all, it kinda feels slimy until it dries.  If you accidentally get some on your eye lashes they with get sticky and clump together, often in a way that puts them poking straight into my eyes.  Secondly, I saw no difference even after using it for two weeks.  It promises you&#x27;ll see results in three days, but I never saw any results.  My eyes are still dark underneath, and the small wrinkles under them are unchanged.  They&#x27;re exactly the same as they were before using this eye cream.  I gave it two stars instead of one only because I might use it until I can buy some other eye cream.</li>
    <li> I have been using more expensive products but decided to try the Garnier skin care line.  I ordered this product and a face cream and have been very pleased with it.  It is not greasy and goes on easily.  I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 2 weeks now and I really see a difference ....</li>
    <li> I am giving it 3 stars because I just bought it, so I really can&#x27;t say how good a product it is yet, but I wanted to ask- Is it supposed to be clear?  When I think of &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t think of a clear product. So I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s something wrong with mine, or if I need to squish the tube somehow, to mix it??</li>
    <li> I have been using Garnier Skin Ultra-Lift Miracle Sleeping Cream for years and I have had good results with it.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products for tired eyes over the years and for me this works.  What I mean about work is firming up the eye area. It doesn&#x27;t help with wrinkles, but it&#x27;s effective for me, which is why I&#x27;ve stuck with it over the years. It&#x27;s one of only a few products where the least expensive one actually works well for me. It makes me look like I got a really good night of sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a great consistency that spreads out evenly and absorbs well. It is thick, but it&#x27;s not in a bad way. It feels great going on. While it does say to use at night, I also use this in the daytime, because it works. I don&#x27;t need to use a lot and a tube will easily last me several weeks, with often using twice daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;ve noticed is that we&#x27;re all different and what works for one, doesn&#x27;t for another. I wish everyone could get my good results from the&lt;br /&gt;Ultra-Lift Miracle Sleeping Cream, but we&#x27;re all different.  My issue is puffy eyes, not dryness and this really works well for me.</li>
    <li> This product is in the \\&quot;drugstore\\&quot; price range of anti-aging products so I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for how well it would work.  Maybe because of my lower expectations, I was surprised that it did have a noticeable improvement on the appearance of the wrinkles under my eyes.  I have, or course, seen more improvement with some of the more expensive products I have tried but those products are not in my budget and this product is.  For the price I thought it did a pretty good job.</li>
    <li> Although this is called a cream it is really a gel -- a wonderfully smooth gel that applies smoothly and absorbs easily.  You apply it from a tube so there isn&#x27;t the potential for cross-contamination that exists when eye cream comes in little pots that you have to dip your finger into night after night. There is no odor, for which I am grateful  (perfumed products near the eyes seem to be begging to irritate, IMO). I felt that my eyes looked better from the first night., primarily because of the moisturizing effect. I don&#x27;t have big problems with puffiness and dark circles, so I can&#x27;t comment on how effective this cream is for those problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might work well for you if, like me, your main problem is aging skin that tends to be dry, and you dislike heavy creams.</li>
    <li> A wonderful eye cream!  Garnier makes quality products, and this is no exception.  I like this particular eye cream because you get a double whammy - caffeine, which really does depuff eyes, and hyaluronic acid which is excellent for smoothing out wrinkles.  This little tube contains a cache of excellent ingredients.  A really lovely eye cream and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Working enough that I&#x27;ve bought a renewal.  Not sure there is any magic cream out there but I like this one and do feel like I look more &amp;#34;refreshed&amp;#34; when I use it.</li>
    <li> I have used this gel-cream for a couple of months &amp; I&#x27;ve seen no improvement in under eye puffiness, dark circles or fine lines. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> These are my observations after three weeks of use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Although it is a small tube, very little is needed each night, so  I expect the tube to last quite a while. This makes it a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Although I tend to have reactions to many creams and cosmetics, I&#x27;ve had no adverse reactions to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--I don&#x27;t have dark circles under my eyes, what I do have is puffiness (bags under my eyes) which is sometimes pink. I apply this product at night and, in the morning, I arise with much less puffiness than I did previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--The puffiness-reduction effect lasts for quite a while but, by late afternoon, gravity, age, and stress kick in. This is, after all, a cream not surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--I do like the product and will continue to use it since I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Saw and could feel it working after the first night.  Its more of a gel like substance than a cream and it absorbs really fast.  No puffy bags under my eyes anymore when I wake up and I can see and feel that it lifted by upper brow as well.  No stinging or burning which I usually experience with eye creams.  I will repost when done with the tube as to the long term promises on the bottle-ie getting rid of lines/wrinkles.</li>
    <li> The cream looked okay but doesn&#x27;t really work. It&#x27;s like lotion..</li>
    <li> This shows I ordered and received 2 of this eye gel. Yes. Its the best. But I only received 1. So I think you should refund my husbands card. If you dont....I will never buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried plenty of eye creams that say they will get rid of dark circles. They did not. Neither does this one. In fact they could not even do as well as a slightly better night&#x27;s sleep for lightening my very dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit my circles are bad, but after using this cream I couldn&#x27;t see any improvement.Not after one day and not after awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a light cream this may not be bad. It&#x27;s a clear, almost unscented gel. It did not have good moisturizing properties (the other big reason to use these creams), my undereye area was not moister after using. Yes it&#x27;s tested so it&#x27;s safe to use around your eyes, but if it does nothing -- why bother?</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and rarely use makeup. Unfortunately I have dark circles under my eyes and they have gotten darker and somewhat puffy as I got older. When I was offered this product to review, I hoped that it would help me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my skin is sensitive, I first tested for allergic reaction for applying the cream to the inside of my arm at the elbow where skin is fairly thin. The next morning I checked and there was no sign of a reaction. Good! That night I applied the cream under one eye. Again, no reaction, but no discernible improvement in the appearance of the skin either. The next night I tried it under both eyes. When I checked the mirror the next morning, not only was there no improvement but a pimple had appeared under one eye! Uh oh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had a pimple in years. I am old enough to be a grandmother so this is not acne. I guess the last time I had a pimple was a similar situation; I had just started using some cosmetic product. Well, I won&#x27;t be trying this one again. Obviously it is not good for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients appear to be safe for normal skin so I give this a couple of stars for that.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Can see big differences in my eyes in just a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I had very dark shadowsunder my eyes. After consistent use of this for 2 weeks the shadows have decreased substantially. I use to not want to look at myself in the mirror. Now I&#x27;m just amazed at the difference.</li>
    <li> While it goes on smooth, smells pretty,and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling sticky.... it does nothing for my skin.</li>
    <li> Really like this item along with the night creme</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m cynical enough about marketing claims that I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle, but I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. I have the crepe-y puffy eyelids that make me look tired. I have used a few different eye creams, all of which moisturize and make the eyelid skin feel good. This Garnier product falls into that category. Nice enough but nothing special - and most definitely no miracle. My eyelids look no less puffy and fatigued after a few days of use. If this were being marketed as a moisturizer, I&#x27;d probably give it 3 stars. But because it doesn&#x27;t do what it claims to do, only 2.</li>
    <li> I used the Garnier Skin Ultra-Lift Miracle Sleeping Cream for 2 weeks by applying it right before bedtime. It does produce noticeable effects. My eyes are less puffy when I wake up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many other type of eye creams. This product is one of the few that produces noticeable effects.</li>
    <li> First, it&#x27;s a gel, and NOT a cream, as described. Nice, silky texture to it but comes out in quite a bit more than is needed for under two eyes, even with the lightest touch/squeeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It moisturizes OK, nothing spectacular. (Takes awhile after putting it on to &amp;#34;evaporate/dry&amp;#34; under eye. Leave extra time if you are applying a concealer (yes, some folks will use this in daytime) to eyes.) As for the other product benefit claims, in time I&#x27;ve been using, can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen a difference in my under-eye area. Perhaps my puffiness and darkness under eyes is not as severe/prominent as others for whom it has been useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a few other Garnier eye and skin care products and been pleased but every product can&#x27;t be a hit. I think a great deal depends on how serious your own problem is with puffiness and dark circles. And your perceived benefit (It is all in the eyes of the beholder after all.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that a company raises expectations with a product name such as &amp;#34;Ultra-Lift Miracle Sleeping Cream Anti-Age plus Anti-Fatigue Eye Cream&amp;#34; / I&#x27;m always leery when the word &amp;#34;Miracle&amp;#34; is used to describe a product (and frankly, I don&#x27;t even understand how a company is allowed to use that kind of wording in a product name or claim.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if any product can deliver the benefits that this product claims. Expecting a miracle solution to problems that can be both physiological and genetic in terms of origin may just be unrealistic.</li>
    <li> it does not do what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Bought this eye cream at a local store . Noticed recently my eye area was looking very dry when I get up in the morning. Trying to be more diligent about my skin care routine at night and incorporating this really has seemed to help my eyes look less dry and overall better. Nice texture ,I&#x27;ve also used it during the day at times as it&#x27;s not so heavy . Again very good results for a reasonably priced product.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, I could see a difference within days.  My dark circles are lighter and the fine lines around my eyes have diminished signidicantly!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product, but I haven&#x27;t gotten rid of puffiness under my eyes.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT !! After using it for just a few weeks, these is a noticeable lessening of the find lines around my eyes.</li>
    <li> There was no miracle - product did not do anything for me.</li>
    <li> Another  Garnier product that doesn&#x27;t  work.It may moisturize but does absolutely  nothing for puffiness  And dark circles. Which it says it will do. Do not waste  your money.</li>
    <li> After using this product for a month the crepey skin under my eyes is almost completely gone and dark circles are less noticeable. Great product that I will be purchasing again.</li>
