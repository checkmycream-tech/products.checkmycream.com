      <li>Really great for fine oily hair.</li>
      <li>Buy at your own risk.</li>
      <li>It worked, but also smelled like women&#x27;s hairspray and was too &amp;#34;wet,&amp;#34; so I looked to find my own hair</li>
      <li>Very cool!</li>
      <li>Very light weight.  </li>
      <li>I love to curl it</li>
      <li>The hold is okay</li>
      <li>love the hairspray, but the spray bottle did not work, it came out in liquid vs spray.  </li>
      <li>The scent is ok,  but not my favorite.</li>
      <li>I love this hairspray.  </li>
      <li>I love this hairspray.</li>
      <li>All in all I do love this product and will continue to use it, and</li>
      <li>Fantastic product and recommend to all males!</li>
      <li>but the more you spray</li>
      <li>It has a nice clean scent and it holds your hair</li>
      <li>Love this product goes on dry and hold is the best I have found.</li>
      <li>Love this hairspray perfect hold not to stiff or too flexible</li>
      <li>This stuff works just fine.</li>
      <li>It holds great and you can actually style your hair with it after you spray it on.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s especially effective on thin or fine hair, making you look like you have loads more hair than you do.</li>
      <li>I use many different hair products and this is definitely one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>so I guess it&#x27;s up to you to strike that perfect balance of just enough spray for a nice firm</li>
      <li>Instead of doing my hair and hoping it dries enough by the time I am out the door, I can just give a quick spray and be good to go.&lt;br</li>
      <li>With a quick spray of this it stays curly fast!  </li>
      <li>the more apparent it becomes.</li>
      <li>Great hair spray for hard to hold styles.</li>
      <li>No matter how much hot water you run it under, they always break.</li>
      <li>It is my first time ordering from this seller and first time using this product.</li>
      <li>The hold is quite strong and you definitely won&#x27;t be able to easily mess with your hair throughout the day like you can if you&#x27;re just using normal pomade.</li>
      <li>OK, I am a guy with somewhat long hair that I prefer to keep out of my face.  </li>
      <li>I got a sample of this from Ulta and fell in LOVE with this dry spray!  </li>
      <li>Like any other hairspray just don&#x27;t overspray and you&#x27;ll be okay.</li>
      <li>Provides dry strong hold.</li>
      <li>Truly a dry yet effective spray for my short  lifeless hair.</li>
      <li>I love this hairspray - it goes on dryer and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair</li>
      <li>Maybe every fourth or fifth bottle stops working with more than 3/4 of the product left.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff... holds without being sticky or heavy.  </li>
      <li>However, the thickness of my hair makes it heavy with pomade in it and, unless I sit perfectly still for 30 minutes to let it dry, it will fall down and/or hairs will spring up out of place.</li>
      <li>As far as the smell I think it smells a little alcoholy, again the more you spray</li>
      <li>But when I tried to contact the seller for an exhange I had no responce, and am still waiting to trade my item in for a new one because I would still like to try this KMS hairspray.</li>
      <li>Im sure only a small issue with manufacturing.</li>
      <li>just found a new product I can buy locally.</li>
      <li>This KMS one goes on dry, holds very well, and if you brush your hair after it dries it does not leave any residue.  </li>
      <li>spent too much money for something like this not too work.  </li>
      <li>It was no biggie though because all I had to do to fix the problem was place the nozzle head under some hot running water and with a Q-tip dig out the sticky dried up hairspray that was clogging the hole.</li>
      <li>but without hairspray it gets weighted down fast and looses curl by the end of the day.  </li>

<li> Hair is dry in seconds and it stays up all day.</li>
<li> I have long dark medium thickness hair.  </li>
<li> It goes on so incredibly dry that you never mat down your hair.  </li>
<li> This spray holds pretty well and was less expensive than the Kenra I usually use.</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it for any man who has a hard time time keeping his hair style in place once he styles it, especially if you have thick hair.</li>
<li> And I&#x27;m tired of bringing the hairspray back to the store for an exchange.</li>
<li> It holds well but isn&#x27;t too heavy.</li>

<li> I am overall disappointed with the product that I received.</li>
<li> I have very thick hair</li>
<li> Like another reviewer, I&#x27;m tired of getting bottles that don&#x27;t spray.</li>
<li> but you know they&#x27;re annoyed.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if it was just me or the spray nozzle on the can, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn&#x27;t get the hairspray to come out, unless I used two hands, which would make it impossible to use.</li>
<li> Like the product, too expensive to use.</li>
<li> I struggle to find products that don&#x27;t make my hair feel gunky, or make it look dirty.</li>
<li> Annoying but again no biggie.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It adore this stuff.  It fixes my style for hours and hours but doesn&#x27;t make it look stiff. It goes on so incredibly dry that you never mat down your hair.  You have a couple of seconds to scrunch or poof your hair into another position before it is &amp;#34;locked&amp;#34; into place.  It&#x27;s especially effective on thin or fine hair, making you look like you have loads more hair than you do. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray - it goes on dryer and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair</li>
    <li> staying power without the stickiness!</li>
    <li> Like the product, too expensive to use.</li>
    <li> I order this multiple times because it costs triple in the store and it doesn&#x27;t have shane so best for man and lasts all day</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get over the smell...</li>
    <li> I will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> This spray holds pretty well and was less expensive than the Kenra I usually use. The scent is ok,  but not my favorite.</li>
    <li> This product works about the same as any product you can get in a regular drug store.</li>
    <li> I have been using this hairspray for several years now. It holds well but isn&#x27;t too heavy. I think you will like it too.</li>
    <li> Really great for fine oily hair. I struggle to find products that don&#x27;t make my hair feel gunky, or make it look dirty.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was just me or the spray nozzle on the can, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn&#x27;t get the hairspray to come out, unless I used two hands, which would make it impossible to use. Buy at your own risk.</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray.  It has a nice clean scent and it holds your hair yet you can still run&lt;br /&gt;your fingers through it.  I recommend it.  Been using it for years.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this from Ulta and fell in LOVE with this dry spray!  It works great for summer frizz and winter static and everything in between!  I have long dark medium thickness hair.  I love to curl it but without hairspray it gets weighted down fast and looses curl by the end of the day.  With a quick spray of this it stays curly fast!  It&#x27;s not wet and nasty either since it is a dry spray.  Also for wedding season updo&#x27;s it&#x27;s a must!  In the swampness of the summer my updo&#x27;s stay picture perfect (no frizz or fro to be seen).</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It holds great and you can actually style your hair with it after you spray it on. Very cool!</li>
    <li> I use many different hair products and this is definitely one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Hair is dry in seconds and it stays up all day. Fantastic product and recommend to all males!</li>
    <li> Very light weight.  Does not leave a film the next day.  Because it&#x27;s aerosol, you need to open a window or do it before you leave the house.  The smell is very nice, but it stays around and you don&#x27;t want to breathe that in.</li>
    <li> I loved this hairspray for years but I have finally given up on it. Like another reviewer, I&#x27;m tired of getting bottles that don&#x27;t spray. Maybe every fourth or fifth bottle stops working with more than 3/4 of the product left. And I&#x27;m tired of bringing the hairspray back to the store for an exchange. They always say no problem but you know they&#x27;re annoyed. It&#x27;s something about the spray design. No matter how much hot water you run it under, they always break.</li>
    <li> This stuff works just fine. Like any other hairspray just don&#x27;t overspray and you&#x27;ll be okay. If you overspray you tend to get some white residue. As far as the smell I think it smells a little alcoholy, again the more you spray the more apparent it becomes. The hold is okay but the more you spray the stronger the hold so I guess it&#x27;s up to you to strike that perfect balance of just enough spray for a nice firm hold without  the flakes and  overpowering smell. I&#x27;ve read some of the reviews were people complain that the bottle stops working and yeah the bottle I had did get clogged about two to three times. It was no biggie though because all I had to do to fix the problem was place the nozzle head under some hot running water and with a Q-tip dig out the sticky dried up hairspray that was clogging the hole. Annoying but again no biggie.</li>
    <li> Love this product goes on dry and hold is the best I have found. I would recommend all there products.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff... holds without being sticky or heavy.  Truly a dry yet effective spray for my short  lifeless hair.</li>
    <li> I also had a problem with the sprayer, I returned it to the store and they replaced it for me. The sales associate tried 2 cans before she found one that sprayed correctly.  All in all I do love this product and will continue to use it, and if it doesn&#x27;t spray I will just keep on returning it.  Maybe then someone will contact the manufacturer and they will correct this problem..</li>
    <li> Great hair spray for hard to hold styles.It dries immediately.</li>
    <li> I am overall disappointed with the product that I received. It is my first time ordering from this seller and first time using this product. However, the hairspray does not spray..Im sure only a small issue with manufacturing. But when I tried to contact the seller for an exhange I had no responce, and am still waiting to trade my item in for a new one because I would still like to try this KMS hairspray.</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray perfect hold not to stiff or too flexible</li>
    <li> Provides dry strong hold. I use it after I&#x27;ve styled my hair with a matte wax to keep my hair in place all day.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and I&#x27;ve grown it out to do a side parted combover/slick back with pomade. However, the thickness of my hair makes it heavy with pomade in it and, unless I sit perfectly still for 30 minutes to let it dry, it will fall down and/or hairs will spring up out of place. To combat that I started using my girlfriend&#x27;s hairspray. It worked, but also smelled like women&#x27;s hairspray and was too &amp;#34;wet,&amp;#34; so I looked to find my own hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is perfect for me. It&#x27;s got essentially no smell, feels dry when spraying it, and just a little bit of it will hold the whole day. Instead of doing my hair and hoping it dries enough by the time I am out the door, I can just give a quick spray and be good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note, it is called &amp;#34;Xtreme&amp;#34; for a reason. The hold is quite strong and you definitely won&#x27;t be able to easily mess with your hair throughout the day like you can if you&#x27;re just using normal pomade. This doesn&#x27;t bother me at all but it might for some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it for any man who has a hard time time keeping his hair style in place once he styles it, especially if you have thick hair.</li>
    <li> OK, I am a guy with somewhat long hair that I prefer to keep out of my face.  I have tried a number of hair sprays that are sticky and/or do not hold.  This KMS one goes on dry, holds very well, and if you brush your hair after it dries it does not leave any residue.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray. It sprays well, it holds well and it smells really good! I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I only used 10 hairspray for years.  i got this sample by fuke from my stylist... i loved it!!This spray is amazing!!! The only hairspray I will ever get for me and my girls!! Absolutely love it!!!</li>
    <li> love the hairspray, but the spray bottle did not work, it came out in liquid vs spray.  spent too much money for something like this not too work.  just found a new product I can buy locally.</li>
