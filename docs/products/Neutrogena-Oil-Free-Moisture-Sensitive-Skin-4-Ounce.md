### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>GOOD JOB, NEUTROGENA!! :D</li>
      <li>It is the best I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>Neutrogena makes wonderful moisturizers.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Since it does not clog pores, it is very good</li>
      <li>As for moisturizing, it does a good job.</li>
      <li>Dear Sir or Madam,    Received product and as always, very pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>Very light weight!</li>
      <li>I got this about a week ago and i am IN LOVE!</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>It stores very easily and the pump can be locked for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>:)&#x27; love it!</li>
      <li>Best moisturizer for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Very good product- highly recommended for people who do not wear a lot of makeup like myself.</li>
      <li>I feel very fortunate to have found it.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>love this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I use one pump and warm it up before applying it to my face and neck and tapping for quick absorption.    </li>
      <li>It absorbs very quickly without leaving my face and neck oily, or with that &amp;#34;it&#x27;s just gonna sit ON my skin and not absorb</li>
      <li>Oil free, light-weight, fast absorption, scentless, very smooth, great for sensitive skin  Cons:</li>
      <li>Hydrates without grease and applies smoothly.</li>
      <li>: This product rubs in smoothly and evenly and does not leave an oily residue.</li>
      <li>My skin is good now, the face creams I used, frying the skin of my face, so far it&#x27;s alright .</li>
      <li>my arms and face tend to be very dry, this product really helped me to have a softer and flawless skin!</li>
      <li>I use it as a moisturizer twice a day on a clean face.  </li>
      <li>I love this moisturizer, and I was so excited to find out that I could subscribe to an order of this product straight from Neutrogena.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a true fan of this stuff</li>
      <li>It is great for use under makeup during the day, but if you&#x27;re really looking for moisture, then you would want to use an extra product at night.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s extremely mild,</li>
      <li>I started out using the formula for oil control, but after reading an article that describes how oil targeted products can sometimes make oily skin even more oily to compensate, I switched to the sensitive formula and couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After using the medication the Dermatologist prescribed, I was able to use this and clear up the rest of the problem within days.  </li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I put it on right after the shower and my skin feels nice all day, minimal break outs.</li>
      <li>It does not irritate my sensitive skin, in part because it is fragrance free.</li>
      <li>I have rosacea, so most of the over the counter skin moisturizers (as well as anything i use on my face) leave my face red, swollen, hot and blotchy.</li>
      <li>In the summer I use one full pump (be sure to massage it in, it does no good just sitting on the skin) and in the winter I use two full pumps.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My skin on my face is much improved.</li>
      <li>I now use the whole oil-free non-comedogenic Neutrogena line.</li>
      <li>I use it with Neutrogena ultra gentle hydrating cleanser.</li>
      <li>I also use the moisturizer as an aftershave since I don&#x27;t really like astringent aftershaves.</li>
      <li>Have been using the same product for the last 5 years and love it every time.</li>
      <li>The savings are phenomenal, and I don&#x27;t feel guilty paying the high cost that most suppliers mark up.</li>
      <li>To be concise, THIS PRODUCT WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product as a face moisturizer because it does not clog pores, and it feels very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>No itching or burning and just the right amount of moisture for daily use.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a new moisturizer, then give this one a try.</li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive, and I have been using this moisturizer for two years with no complaints.</li>
      <li>I am one who likes her products basic, clean and with no frills and this is definitely one of those.</li>
      <li>I came to amazon.com to check the bottles and sure enough the one with the black rectangle is new and doesn&#x27;t have a review at all when I checked it.    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried this and the regular version of this neutrogena lotion, but I think the \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; version (even though my skin is not that sensitive) is better because it&#x27;s a lot lighter and doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel dry/tight/heavy like the other version</li>
      <li>and it has not irritated my sensitive skin at all.</li>
      <li>Overall I really like the feel of the product</li>
      <li>my experience with sensitive skin</li>
      <li>recommend that you buy the sensitive skin version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My dermatologist recommended Neutrogena to avoid breakouts since I have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>However, if you have extremely dry skin, you probably want a more heavy duty moisturizer.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ve tried numerous facial washes and many of them dried out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall, I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a fragrance-free, basic, go-to moisturizer!</li>
      <li>But watch out, it has to be the one for sensitive skin, with the blue and purple rectangle on the bottle.</li>

<li> Packaging - not very good for travel since it is a pump, also can&#x27;t get all of the product out of the bottle; while fast absorption, also is not moisturizing enough for dry environments or winter - when I sleep at night, I like to put an extra moisturizing pack on my face in addition to the lotion    </li>

<li> I bought this moisturizer about 3 weeks ago and my skin how slowly started to clear up.</li>
<li> /&gt;However, it took a few days for my dry skin to fully improve because I had dried it out through facial washes and swimming.</li>
<li> /&gt;Hydrating: My skin is oily to combination, and this product gives me the hydration I need without making my skin extremely oily.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for about 8 years. Can&#x27;t say enough good things. It&#x27;s extremely mild, no fragrance and does not leave your skin feeling oily.  I also use the moisturizer as an aftershave since I don&#x27;t really like astringent aftershaves. I haven&#x27;t noticed any razor burn or ingrown hairs, so I would say that this moisturizer is probably doing the trick.  Depending on your skin type, you should be able to get away with just putting this on once in the morning, however, multiple applications are not a huge deal since it does not leave behind an oily residue.  If you&#x27;re looking for a new moisturizer, then give this one a try.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Very light weight! No greasy film.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer, and I was so excited to find out that I could subscribe to an order of this product straight from Neutrogena. I get this pack of two sent to me every 6 months, as each bottle lasts me about 3 months. The savings are phenomenal, and I don&#x27;t feel guilty paying the high cost that most suppliers mark up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m now finishing up my second bottle of these and this is a dependable product. It does not irritate my sensitive skin, in part because it is fragrance free. I am one who likes her products basic, clean and with no frills and this is definitely one of those. Should anything go wrong with my skin due to experimentation with new products, I know that I can come back to this to moisturize my skin without too many unnecessary and irritating chemicals.    As for moisturizing, it does a good job. However, for deep moisture, I would look for something heavier. (I&#x27;m currently looking for a heavier moisturizer for the winter if anyone has any recommendations.)    Overall, I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a fragrance-free, basic, go-to moisturizer!</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive, and I have been using this moisturizer for two years with no complaints. But watch out, it has to be the one for sensitive skin, with the blue and purple rectangle on the bottle. By mistake, I bought the other that has the purple and black rectangle, which its for sensitive skin also and after few days using it I noticed my face started to break out, I didn&#x27;t know why since I was still using the same thing, until I got the bottle and noticed it had the black rectangle which the other ones didn&#x27;t have. I came to amazon.com to check the bottles and sure enough the one with the black rectangle is new and doesn&#x27;t have a review at all when I checked it.    So, if you got sensitive skin, stay away from the black rectangle and the green one (SPF) that one will burn.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with acne since I was 14 (I am now 23), nothing has ever worked, not even expensive Proactiv. I bought this moisturizer about 3 weeks ago and my skin how slowly started to clear up. I guess I was using the wrong moisturizer all along. I wish I would have seen this product years ago! I now use the whole oil-free non-comedogenic Neutrogena line.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this and the regular version of this neutrogena lotion, but I think the \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; version (even though my skin is not that sensitive) is better because it&#x27;s a lot lighter and doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel dry/tight/heavy like the other version</li>
    <li> my arms and face tend to be very dry, this product really helped me to have a softer and flawless skin! :)&#x27; love it!</li>
    <li> Dear Sir or Madam,    Received product and as always, very pleased with the results. Thank you for carrying their products.    Coleen H. Thompson</li>
    <li> I have rosacea, so most of the over the counter skin moisturizers (as well as anything i use on my face) leave my face red, swollen, hot and blotchy. I got this about a week ago and i am IN LOVE! It absorbs very quickly without leaving my face and neck oily, or with that &amp;#34;it&#x27;s just gonna sit ON my skin and not absorb so i&#x27;m gonna have to wipe half of it off&amp;#34; feeling. My rosacea is not made worse with this product. I&#x27;m a true fan of this stuff and i seriously doubt i will EVER use anything else as a moisturizer. GOOD JOB, NEUTROGENA!! :D</li>
    <li> To be concise, THIS PRODUCT WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product as a face moisturizer because it does not clog pores, and it feels very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it does not clog pores, it is very good acne-prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend that you buy the sensitive skin version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my experience with sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve tried numerous facial washes and many of them dried out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer is the solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have very dry, flaky skin, you will notice the difference immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it took a few days for my dry skin to fully improve because I had dried it out through facial washes and swimming.</li>
    <li> The reason I was looking for a lotion without alcohol was due to a skin breakout on my hands.  After using the medication the Dermatologist prescribed, I was able to use this and clear up the rest of the problem within days.  I would definitely recommend this...</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer for sensitive skin. Have been using the same product for the last 5 years and love it every time. No itching or burning and just the right amount of moisture for daily use.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena makes wonderful moisturizers. Love this product. I started out using the formula for oil control, but after reading an article that describes how oil targeted products can sometimes make oily skin even more oily to compensate, I switched to the sensitive formula and couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gentle: I have acne prone skin that is extremely susceptible to friction/irritation breakouts. The buffing motion caused by rubbing in products has caused me to breakout before. But I&#x27;ve never had this problem with Neutrogena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Creamy: This product rubs in smoothly and evenly and does not leave an oily residue. I have oily skin and this product does not make me feel like a grease ball like application like some other moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hydrating: My skin is oily to combination, and this product gives me the hydration I need without making my skin extremely oily. In the summer I use one full pump (be sure to massage it in, it does no good just sitting on the skin) and in the winter I use two full pumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: The bottle comes with a pump for no mess application and it is tapered slightly so the bottom is thinner than the middle of the bottle. It stores very easily and the pump can be locked for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry Skin: If you have extremely bad dry skin, I&#x27;m not sure this product will be enough to compensate. I predominantly have oily skin, but during the colder months I do get a little &#x27;ashy&#x27; on the face on my nose and cheekbones and I have to increase my usage from one pump to two pumps, and I still have a little bit of peeling skin on my nose. If you have extremely dry skin, I would recommend a product like Cetaphil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this moisturizer. Worth every penny. Hydrates without grease and applies smoothly. However, if you have extremely dry skin, you probably want a more heavy duty moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I use this product twice a day after washing my face in the morning and night. My dermatologist recommended Neutrogena to avoid breakouts since I have sensitive skin. I use one pump and warm it up before applying it to my face and neck and tapping for quick absorption.    Pros: Oil free, light-weight, fast absorption, scentless, very smooth, great for sensitive skin  Cons: Packaging - not very good for travel since it is a pump, also can&#x27;t get all of the product out of the bottle; while fast absorption, also is not moisturizing enough for dry environments or winter - when I sleep at night, I like to put an extra moisturizing pack on my face in addition to the lotion    Overall I really like the feel of the product and it has not irritated my sensitive skin at all. It is great for use under makeup during the day, but if you&#x27;re really looking for moisture, then you would want to use an extra product at night. One bottle lasts for around 3-4 months - would definitely recommend the product!</li>
    <li> I use it as a moisturizer twice a day on a clean face.  It is the best I have ever used.  I have used several of the big name products that are very expensive and compared to this Neutrogena product they do nothing. I feel very fortunate to have found it.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my mom. She loves this product.</li>
    <li> My skin is good now, the face creams I used, frying the skin of my face, so far it&#x27;s alright .</li>
    <li> Very good product- highly recommended for people who do not wear a lot of makeup like myself. I put it on right after the shower and my skin feels nice all day, minimal break outs.</li>
    <li> I use it with Neutrogena ultra gentle hydrating cleanser. My skin on my face is much improved. The bottle I received has a black background with the word Neutrogena on the bottom of the bottle. Differant from the picture on their website.</li>
