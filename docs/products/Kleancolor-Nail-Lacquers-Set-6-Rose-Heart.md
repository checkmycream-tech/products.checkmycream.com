      <li>As mentioned in the headline above, what more is there to say?</li>

      <li>and it still doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference!</li>

      <li>First package must have been lost in the mail</li>
      <li>One bottle came cracked though, it was still sealed (not spilling) but it has a pretty large crack in it.</li>

      <li>I was pleasantly surprised to see that this was a full sized 6 piece set so with the price, it&#x27;s definitely a bargain.</li>
      <li>I probably just wasn&#x27;t gentle enough with the removal, as they are wrapped tight to keep them safe.</li>

      <li>The colors are pretty and they last for almost 2 weeks</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The price was great, especially for 6 colors. The colors a re very pretty, I really like them. One bottle came cracked though, it was still sealed (not spilling) but it has a pretty large crack in it. Also, the colors don&#x27;t stay on very long. I&#x27;ve had to touch up my nails every day since i painted them. It could be my top coat but none the less, they dont stay on. The colors are very opaque though. I use one coat and im good to go. All in all, I got what I paid for I guess, I mean how good can I expect 2 dollat nail polish to be.</li>
    <li> This is a great set. Has light colors, daily wear and green, orange and olive it&#x27;s for party time or summer. Totally love it. Also lacquers covers pretty good and dries fast.</li>
    <li> I have not used any Kleancolor product before but now I am a big fan! I was pleasantly surprised to see that this was a full sized 6 piece set so with the price, it&#x27;s definitely a bargain. The Rose Heart collection contains the following colors: Mystic Grass, Pearl Beige, Jazz Olive, Boogie Nights, Wild Rose &amp; Orchid Chrome. The nail polish has great coverage and 1-2 coats should be enough. Dries pretty quickly too.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this nail polish.     Pros:  very opaque after 2 coats you don&#x27;t see the nail at all or \\&quot;light\\&quot; through the tips.  Long lasting (oddly the easiest way to remove this is to put on a fresh coat of  the polish and wipe with cloth it removes all the color, I had to fight it off with nail polish remover)  beautiful fun colors    Cons:  Only included two colors that could be considered \\&quot;everyday work appropriate\\&quot;  Hard to remove with polish remover  takes a VERY long time to dry, honestly it remains soft for HOURS</li>
    <li> I am using it to work with my clients and they are all happy.&lt;br /&gt;thx Kleancolor for this great delivery time and product</li>
    <li> I had never tried Kleancolor nail polish before, but you couldn&#x27;t beat the price so I had to snatch these up. They are really pretty colors and go on smooth. The only issues I have is that they take a little longer to dry and require a nice layer of top coat to ensure they don&#x27;t peel. But all in all I&#x27;m satisfied with the product and the price I paid.</li>
    <li> These polishes are pretty and they dry very quickly.  I love the colors and was pleasantly surprised to find that they do not smell chemically at all.  The polish goes on very nicely without bubbles or streaks.  I am going to have to get all the colors, I just love these!</li>
    <li> this set! these colors are amazing, so many pretty colors, i really love every single color in this set, they are beautiful</li>

    <li> I love these, I bought three sets, they go on smooth and hold up really nicely.  The color selection is awesome!  I&#x27;d buy them again..</li>
    <li> Bought these for the wife and she loves them. Very cool colors. Just came wrapped in bubble wrap but fine.</li>
    <li> Nice look, long lasting and I do love it, I use it in my new shop, and my customers really like it!</li>
    <li> Oh I couldn&#x27;t decide which color to put on for hours. Didn&#x27;t chip for days and even then I was running around in the yard with the lil ones when it did. Look forward to buying more colors.</li>
    <li> The bottles are small, but the colors are big. I like the glimmer as well, I will reorder these in the future</li>
    <li> I bought this set of colors as well as one other one that had some more subdued tones.  I was very surprised at the quality of this nail polish for the price that it is.  I will definitely by this brand in the future if I ever feel the need for some more colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like all of these, the purple one does have some glitter in which I wasn&#x27;t expecting, I probably won&#x27;t ever use that one.  I figure I&#x27;ll just give it as a small gift to someone who would use it.  But, the rest of the colors are great, I actually really love the orange which I wasnt expecting to like at all!</li>
    <li> Great nail polish.  Very pretty colors that last a long time!  Will be back for more.  Great products. I get a lot of compliments too!</li>
    <li> Very nice, my mother in law love it!</li>
    <li> This was a gift, so this review is how it came and what I saw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are very nice and the seller packed it nicely with bubble wrap. I don&#x27;t know how they look painted on or how durable the paint is. I am looking forward to hearing what my nieces think.</li>
    <li> Hmm, maybe I received a bad batch the colors are gorgeous (Wild Rose) in the bottle.. Dried fast.  But the consistency is as if it is thinned out with nail polish remover. No shine or shimmer, just intense color. I doubt if I&#x27;ll buy it again if the other colors are better I&#x27;ll repost</li>
    <li> love the colors and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Colors are nice and vibrant!  Be sure to put very thin coats or it will get streaky.  Will buy more of this brand.</li>
    <li> I got a present.  this nail lovely colors all.  I like it  I love it . nice set .&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Wonderful color, dries quick and stays on a long time. First package must have been lost in the mail but when I contacted the seller replacing it was painless and it showed  up two days later.</li>
    <li> Great colors and fun to use. She loved them!</li>
    <li> As mentioned in the headline above, what more is there to say?</li>
    <li> The only reason why I did not give it five stars is based on this: when I received the package one of the bottles was broken because it was not wrapped properly. Other thatn that it is a great product and the nail polish last unlike the others I have used.</li>
    <li> She loves the colors and quality of the polish...</li>
    <li> the color was cheap so it didn&#x27;t stay on long but what do you expect for the price. I bought two sets and then mixed up the colors for separate gifts. The girls I got them for were young and appreciative. So its a win win.</li>
    <li> I have a friend who loves nail art, so I got her these to start her off! They&#x27;re cheap, but the pigmentation is AMAZING!</li>
    <li> The colors are great and go on very well... But they chip so easy you always have to touch them up, and all of the colors are like that! I use really good top coat and it still doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference! But for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong even though they do chip a lot! I also tend to change my nail color every 2 or 3 days, so with that being said they shouldn&#x27;t chip or peel as much  as they do with in the few days I actually wear them. Either way I still use them because I like the colors and really it&#x27;s not such a huge deal to me! But they do chip unfortunately! :(</li>
    <li> Shipping took about a week and a half for me! It wasn&#x27;t that bad though. The colors are BEAUTIFUL!? Most of them were exactly shown as pictured! The one that came out not as expected was the Mystic Grass color. The pic shows the color as more of a bluish color! In reality it&#x27;s more shimmery green than blue! Other than than that everything else was pretty good!</li>
    <li> The colors go very smoothly on the nails and have a nice sheen.  The colors go with many different outfits and some are good as neutrals.</li>
    <li> These polishes are pretty great. The six pack of colors are very vibrant and the price was good. I&#x27;m officially a fan of Kleancolor Nail lacquers.</li>
    <li> I loved adding these shades to my kleancolor collection .They&#x27;re a nice assortment that I will enjoy using.</li>
    <li> The pallet of colors was as described.  Nice and bright, opaque (over base coat) with only one coat. All ; colors are great and I can&#x27;t wait to wear each of them.</li>
    <li> Chip pretty easy but overall nice colors! Good for spring/summer</li>
    <li> The colors are very pretty, but I think are more suitable for a teenager or young girl.  I kept three of them and gave the other three to my grandchild.</li>
    <li> My 3rd time buying from this seller, as always the nail polish goes on smoothy .The colors are always so beautiful and unique.</li>
    <li> I can only applaud the depth of color and lasting power of these nail polishes.  I will look for the word &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; to tell difference between them from the full size which these were.  I change my colors often to match my outfits, so nothing is wasted on me.;o}!!</li>
    <li> I was expecting mini bottles so I was shocked when I go these in the mail! Full size bottles. I love all the colors and I won&#x27;t have to buy nail polish for a very long time!</li>
    <li> The colors are vibrant and my daughter loves the polish but to me they smell extra stinky. It could just be me though, she does her nails inside and the smell is really strong</li>
    <li> This item was a gift for a co-worker.  She is very satisfied with the product.  The product was received one day before the stated delivery date.</li>
    <li> Shipped quick.  Packaged appropriately.  A piece of the bottle broke when I was removing it from the bubble wrap on one bottle, but it did not leak or compromise usage. I probably just wasn&#x27;t gentle enough with the removal, as they are wrapped tight to keep them safe. Would buy again from this seller.  My favorite is the Wild Rose dark purple color. I&#x27;m wearing it now. It&#x27;s pretty.  The orchid color is nice too, it has bits of glitter.  Can&#x27;t wait to wear it.  All of them are rich in color and pigment.  I&#x27;d say the aqua color will be a favorite of folks as well.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love every single one of these colors they give me so many choices to choose from. And the quality is great the seller is also really great too.</li>
