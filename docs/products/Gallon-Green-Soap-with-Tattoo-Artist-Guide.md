      <li>This soap cuts right through any leftover ink.</li>
      <li>I get a lot of laughs from the older artists for \\&quot;Bathing my clients in green soap\\&quot; Wipes of ink beautifully.</li>

      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>As for Superior green soap.</li>
      <li>Took A little longer than I expected to arrive, but am very happy with the product.</li>
      <li>Most compliment me on how clean I keep everything, thanks to Green Soap</li>
      <li>superior tattoo supply is a total rip off, if you check their main website this is only 12.50 vs 17.45</li>
      <li>Green soap is not only great for tattoo&#x27;s</li>
      <li>Real artists, Real Equip, Real Service.</li>
      <li>The seller we buy from on Amazon.com has always had fast shipping.</li>
      <li>cant say much about this item since there is not another product like this i think.</li>
      <li>I live in Germany and it got here really fast.</li>
      <li>I just purchased this GREEN SOAP, again, yes if you sling ink especially professionally or otherwise then you should diffenately be using this product, and along with other products, naturally, but Green Soap is about the best product that I have ever purchased for sterile working conditions, I use it to clean ink(s) off of my customers as well as the work area.</li>
      <li>If you are tattooing regularly than u need a big bottle of soap because it will be used consistently through prep, tattooing and clean up.  </li>
      <li>u better use this stuff green soap works so well for all diff.</li>
      <li>This soap cuts right through any ink left on a tattoo.</li>
      <li>Works better than any washing solution I&#x27;ve tried in the past...</li>
      <li>Originally i bought this for the book as much if not more than for the soap.</li>
      <li>I just want to give a couple of stars, clear my order history and get on with the rest of my day.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all natural and it cools the tattoo instead of burning it.</li>
      <li>I have been a professional artist for 6 years now.</li>
      <li>a must have for tattooing and came 4 days early</li>
      <li>Green soap is a must, For keeping the area you are working on clean.</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way...economically better to purchase big...</li>
      <li>I have performed several procedures now &amp; used this green soap everytime &amp; have had nothing but success.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> One of the most efficient and safest products I have ever used to create a clean and sanitary tattoo art.  It cleans , disinfects, and can be used to transfer stencils. Speed up the healing process on any tats.</li>
    <li> superior tattoo supply is a total rip off, if you check their main website this is only 12.50 vs 17.45 shouldn&#x27;t the prices be the same? i called customer service and find out there is no return policy that you have to go read the fine print to find that out! i feel like i got money stolen from me! never buying from this company again poor customer service, enough though they said quality customer service on their website!</li>
    <li> cant say much about this item since there is not another product like this i think. never the less it wipe good n does not burn or irritates the skin. i even use it on me when i tattoo my self</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! I live in Germany and it got here really fast. I do recommend to any tattoo artist. Mixes well.</li>
    <li> if ur getting tattooed or tating someone else u better use this stuff green soap works so well for all diff. things cleaning the skin taking off stencil ink etc. i love the smell of it as well</li>
    <li> This soap cuts right through any leftover ink. I&#x27;ve tried other soaps (none tattoo soap) and even some of the best stuff doesn&#x27;t clean as this does, doesn&#x27;t leave any soapy residue either.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t come with the Tattoo Artist Guide like it was supposed too. I don&#x27;t like paying for stuff and not getting what you ordered.</li>
    <li> Great seller, great product, will buy from again, A++!</li>
    <li> I just purchased this GREEN SOAP, again, yes if you sling ink especially professionally or otherwise then you should diffenately be using this product, and along with other products, naturally, but Green Soap is about the best product that I have ever purchased for sterile working conditions, I use it to clean ink(s) off of my customers as well as the work area. [note: working areas should also be cleaned with disinfectants].  I have been slinging ink for over 30 years and this is in my oppinion extremely important to have in your studio, I give this product 5 starrs.  The order arrived within a week.</li>
    <li> I think writing down a review should be optional. Just like how it used to be. I just want to give a couple of stars, clear my order history and get on with the rest of my day. But now we can&#x27;t send a rating until we give a review on the product we ordered. I used to only write a review if there was something wrong. I f not, then I give five stars. I don&#x27;t time to write a review for everything I order so I&#x27;ll just copy and paste this on every order. MAKE THIS SECTION OPTIONAL. Thank you and have a great day!</li>
    <li> Great value...A little goes a long way...economically better to purchase big...Works better than any washing solution I&#x27;ve tried in the past...</li>
    <li> Great price for a gallon of green soap mix.  Don&#x27;t listen to that mook that gave it one star, he&#x27;s just a cheapskate.  Very good price, for a very good product.  Will buy again from this seller.</li>
    <li> Great deal for the price and a must have for the tattoo artist . Good but for the money !!</li>
    <li> We use Green Soap for Tattooing and other anticeptic/medical reasons. We have purchased several different brands, but we found this soap to be of equal quality at far less expense than the leading brands. Why pay more if you don&#x27;t have to ? The seller we buy from on Amazon.com has always had fast shipping. If you&#x27;re buying Green Soap you can&#x27;t beat the price anywhere and it&#x27;s quick, affordable and convient through Amazon.[[ASIN:B001CELT3K Gallon Green Soap]]</li>
    <li> The green soap is excellent. I tattoo as a side job (more like a hobby), the shop I work at provides supplies with a rental fee. But I like my own supplies, this stuff does what it needs to do.</li>
    <li> This soap cuts right through any ink left on a tattoo. One part soap with three parts water and it goes through anything. I use it on grease, ink, just about anything. It&#x27;s all natural and it cools the tattoo instead of burning it. And the gallon has lasted me for a long time now</li>
    <li> I think that the product is great. But when I ordered it I was under the impression that it came WITH the artists guide that its advertises. It does NOT come with it. it says it does on the shipping label and everywhere else. But you don&#x27;t get it. I reported that I did not receive the guide and that&#x27;s when they wrote me back saying that \\&quot;it does NOT come with the artists guide sorry\\&quot; I will not be purchasing from this carrier again.</li>
    <li> I never revived the booklet with this it was only the green soup. It also isn&#x27;t in the bottle that&#x27;s in the picture which isn&#x27;t a problem but I think the picture should show what you&#x27;re getting</li>
    <li> First and foremost, Superior Tattoo has hands down the best products in the industry. If they don&#x27;t have it, Then you don&#x27;t need it. I love the service I get from them. Anyways, Back to the matter at hand. I have been a professional artist for 6 years now. And I can tell you this. Green soap is a must, For keeping the area you are working on clean. I get a lot of laughs from the older artists for \\&quot;Bathing my clients in green soap\\&quot; Wipes of ink beautifully. And like I said, The area will always be clean. As for Superior green soap. I&#x27;ve tried many kinds, And some just don&#x27;t make the cut. I mix 4 parts distilled water, To one part green soap. And It&#x27;s all gravy from there. Trust superior, I do...Real artists, Real Equip, Real Service.</li>
    <li> this soap works perfect gets the ink off quick and clean a must have for tattooing and came 4 days early</li>
    <li> Green soap cleans very well and it doesnt smell half bad. It smells slightly of hospital disinfectant but not too badly. If you need to keep your tattoo shop or even your house nice and clean this is the stuff to get.</li>
    <li> Took A little longer than I expected to arrive, but am very happy with the product. works as it should.</li>
    <li> My Green Soap arrived quickly &amp; was in great shape. It had instructions on the bottle for correct mix.I have performed several procedures now &amp; used this green soap everytime &amp; have had nothing but success. Most compliment me on how clean I keep everything, thanks to Green Soap I have gotten more buisness!</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for Son...no comment</li>
    <li> when my friend buy green soap for his tattoo he was spending to much money on tattoo green soap these is cheaper and you get more</li>
    <li> It was in great condition! It arrived as was expected without any problems! I very much recommend them! I am a very satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> Green soap is not only great for tattoo&#x27;s but it is also great around the house for cleaning. It will take off almost anything from all different kinds of surfaces.</li>
    <li> If you are tattooing regularly than u need a big bottle of soap because it will be used consistently through prep, tattooing and clean up.  The book is good for starters as it provides good tips and print material u can use for ur tattoo business.  Great buy with a bonus.</li>
    <li> Originally i bought this for the book as much if not more than for the soap. Only down side is they are out of stock of the artist guide. I contacted this seller with my complaint and they are unable to send me the book but he offered a solution that made my purchase worthwhile. Will definately be using this seller in the future because all was good in the end. --satisfied customer</li>
