<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These clippers are outstanding!  Very little pressure needed to make a cut.  They&#x27;re sharp, accurate and easy to use.  They are, by far, the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> These nail clippers are strong, durable, and one of my new, favorite items in my beauty tool kit!  Until I decided to get this set, I was limping around with a broken set that I&#x27;ve had since high-school.  That was many years ago.  The quality of these clippers are quickly realized and felt as soon as they come out of the package.  I love that they are surgical grade, and easy to sterilize and keep clean and healthy for repetitive use, or for cleaning in between husband and wife usage.  That was my one deciding factor as to why I chose to get this set, in comparison to other sets, for the simple and essential ability to not transfer bacteria between uses and people.  I have several items from Simply Essential, and they&#x27;re always a home run!!! I will be returning for more, and would highly recommend this product and beauty line to anyone.</li>
    <li> As Expected. They are big clippers.</li>
    <li> My father is 89 years old and, of course, has much trouble getting his toe nails clipped.  These were so easy to use he could do the job for himself which made him feel in control again.  I bought a pair for myself and they have been perfect.  This product is the only one I will ever use again and I couldn&#x27;t recommend it more.</li>
    <li> My roommate stole my clippers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered these as they are supposedly larger, the best, and have a nail catcher. Cutting action is not very smooth, metal looks and feels stamped out and is unpleasant to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My roommate then stole these clippers, then returned them. Even my roommate dislikes them. Hopefully the metal will be recycled into a more useful product. Looking into the MUJI or Mehaz clippers next.</li>
    <li> I really like these clippers, have tried several and have trouble cutting both finger nails and toe nails but these work easy for me and I do not have much strength in my hands because of arithrits.</li>
    <li> We have many pairs of nail clippers in the house, because, well, you never know when you need to find one quickly and the darn things seem to disappear more often than socks in the dryer!  I was very happy, therefore, to have a chance to try these at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They claim these are larger than normal nail clippers and this is most definitely true!  At 3.25 inches long, these are the largest sized clippers I can recall seeing.  In this case, I think bigger actually is better - the grip is very sturdy and you can really be precise with getting just where you need to.  They do a great job of getting through even thick or uneven toenails with a simple single snip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never seen nail clippers before with the extra clipped on metal piece that you can see in my photo.  I was confused at first as to what this is for, but then I saw someone in the Q&amp;A for the product say they thought it was to catch the nail clippings.  What a clever idea!  Don&#x27;t we all always struggle with where to put those trimmings to make sure they don&#x27;t go flying everywhere?  It was great to drop them into this little tray and then easy to dump into the garbage can.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give these 4 and a half stars if I could. I think they&#x27;re great but not quite at 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about these is that they&#x27;re sharp - REALLY sharp. You could hurt yourself on these if you weren&#x27;t careful! But that&#x27;s a good thing because my nails aren&#x27;t so much thick as they are rather brittle and a good, sharp cut is what I need to not have them fraying all over the place. I also like that the lever is longer and wider, giving a better grip and leverage.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I don&#x27;t totally love is the catch/sliding side. I think this design would work best for a professional, cutting someone else&#x27;s nails but for me doing all kinds of crazy angles trying to cut my own nails, any caught nails would end up falling out anyway (stupid gravity!). It also never occurred to me until using these, but I do frequently look through the side of my clippers to see where I&#x27;m cutting and these make that slightly more difficult than a traditional pair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure: I was provided these clippers at a discount in exchange for my review, however, having used them, I would have bought them at full price.</li>
    <li> Love!!!!!  My son has very thick toe nails and it is always a hassle cutting them, until we ordered these nail clippers!  They are excellent!  They cut his toe nails with ease!  So happy that we found these!  Don&#x27;t hesitate, buy them!  Definitely worth it!!!</li>
    <li> These are awesome clippers. I have about 3 pair right now. One broke somehow when trying to clip. I guess weak metal maybe one is a trusted brand and work well.. BU these are awesome they feel great, sturdy and cut nails well... AND they come in a little holder sleeve type thing I love them</li>
    <li> This cuts nails very easily - really nice!</li>
    <li> The fact that it&#x27;s closed-up on the sides creates an obstructed view of how much you&#x27;re actually cutting. Also, that same feature prevents you from clipping as much as you may wish. Basically, it&#x27;s a bad choice and poorly built.   Also, the company who makes this clipper has been harassing me with emails (at least 10 emails since my purchase). Very annoying.</li>
    <li> I like this Toenail clipper. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I bought these toenail clippers with high hopes that they would do a great job cutting my thick toenails. No way! Despite the extremely long and keyword-spamming title, they are no bigger than any other clippers (see my photos--they are the ones in the middle). And the jaw does NOT open wide enough to even get around thick toenails! They do seem sharp and cut well, but not for the main purpose described. I returned mine and got a refund from Amazon without hassle. I then bought the Mehaz Professional Angled Straight Wide Jaw Toenail Clipper (blue) and like them much better and they work!</li>
    <li> These are the best nail clippers ever !!!</li>
    <li> Very nice Toenail clipper,it is worth the money.</li>
    <li> These are a little high in price, but worth every penny.  They work great!</li>
    <li> I ordered them from my wife who needed a strong pair of nail clippers.  She says they are amazing!  Professional Nail Clippers.</li>
    <li> Seems pricey until I used them. Better than the Pliers style or any I&#x27;ve used. Thanx</li>
    <li> Hands down the best nail clipper I have ever owned.  Large, sharp, well made.  The cover keeps nail bits from flying everywhere.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The clippers do a nice job. They are sharp, nice and long, and mostly easy to handle. The clippers have good size so they have good torque for some of the thicker nails you encounter.&lt;br /&gt;  The clippers could stand to be a little wider. I wanted a standard set of clippers that were extra wide for people with my extra thick toe nails. Also, the thumb side of the clippers could use a rubber fitting, so that your thumb would be comfortable and not get sore during clipping.&lt;br /&gt;  Overall these are a nice set of nail clippers but for $12.00 you expect a little more.</li>
    <li> These work great. Easy to push. Nicely made.</li>
    <li> Best clippers I have ever had! It cuts you nails so clean and easily that it is surprising. Has a very nice nail catcher attached to it that collects your cut nails. Takes little to no pressure to cut any of my tough nails with out cutting in to the skin also. Throw away your other clippers after you try these, you wont want to go back to them!</li>
    <li> Super sharp and big, almost more the size of toe nail clipper. Does a great job and would buy again.</li>
    <li> Best nail clippers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> Absolutely brilliant,very strong,sturdy and easy to use.Good price for a quality product &amp; prompt delivery too from the USA was also excellent,would reccomend.</li>
    <li> This nail clipper with nail catcher is very sturdy and it cuts even thick tough nails.  The catcher is a bonus because I  have always wanted to solve the problem of picking up stray nails after clipping and grooming.  The construction of the clipper seems to be professional grade material.  At a discount I was able to discover this handy product.  I highly recommend these clippers.</li>
    <li> These are excellent clippers!  Nice and sharp, and very easy to use (important for my arthritis hands).</li>
    <li> I was looking for a back-up of my (Japanese &amp;#34;ten-star&amp;#34; (the brand name), finger-nail, toe-nail) clipper that a (Japanese) friend gave me a decade ago. I thought it an odd gift at the time, but over the years it has proved itself as an excellent tool. Ideally I&#x27;d have bought another one if I could have found one.  I bought two or three other brands on Amazon, but they are too small even for finger-nails, so I don&#x27;t know why they bother making them. This one is a good size for fingers and toes, and as far as I can tell at the moment, the steel seems good enough to last as well as my old ten-star (which is as sharp and accurate as the day I got it).  I give this one 5-stars provisionally, because it looks and feels like a worthy back-up to my old one (but of course I will need to wait 10 years to really be sure).  As an aside, someone else mentions that they don&#x27;t like the sliding portion, but I find this feature most useful, and it is the same as on my older ten-star.</li>
    <li> Sharp, good quality.  I think the size is extra long - some reviewers didn&#x27;t think so.  Great for a nice straight cut.</li>
    <li> Not real thick cut like butter</li>
    <li> This is a nice stainless steel toe nail clippers. If you are someone or know someone who has thick toe or finger nails. Then you need to get this pair for them. Should you drink a lot of milk products your nails will be naturally thicker than the rest. It has a nice easy hold so you won&#x27;t worry about slipping off the clipper. These will work on men or women. This would be a nice addition to a spa to have. I did notice when I went to clip the nail it was very sharp and precise. I like that and hate when I have to go back over them to re-cut a nail.  Once you have tried these you will throw away other pairs. One thing you need to make sure you do is sterilize them after using them. It help keep bacteria down by doing this. I got this in compensation for a review. This is not an endorsed review all thoughts are all myself.</li>
    <li> Amazing clipper, heavy duty for thick nails. Clipper is is pretty  big and very sharp. If you are looking for heavy duty, look no further .</li>
    <li> I received these nail clippers a couple days ago and I absolutely love them!  I have very hard, thick toenails and these were the only clippers that cut right through them.  I tried several different toenail clippers that were not sharp enough and would not work for me.  These definitely do the work.  Thanks for a great product!  I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> It was a little bigger than I hope but I think it’s a very nice clipper overall. I especially like the sliding design (nail catcher) such that nails don’t fly everywhere and easy to clean. The razor is sharp. I think I made the right choice but it would be better to have a picture that shows its actual size.</li>
    <li> Great item, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I purchased a pair of these clippers.  One for me and one for my gf.  We both love them,  They feel so well built and do a great job.  I would recomemed them to anyone interested in a good product.</li>
    <li> I used the new clippers and really do like them.  They are great for my thick toenails and really sharp.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Great product with great design!  The nail catcher slides back easily to empty nail clippings, and it clips well.  This product is entirely metal; no plastic parts.  It has a brushed silver finish, rather than the typical smooth silver finish.  Well packaged.  Very happy with it!</li>
    <li> same size as in stores not an inch bigger save your money. very bad false advertising. i got tricked and taken</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift for my sister. They broke upon first use. Her husband was able to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; them, but how ridiculous is that?</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see how this is being marketed as &amp;#34;Extra Large&amp;#34; as the size is pretty much what a normal toenail clipper is. I purchased this specifically to clip a few toenails that have been damaged and have grown very thick.  The gap in which you insert your nail is exactly the same as a normal toenail clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I purchased these nail clippers because the ones I find at my local drug stores aren&#x27;t sharp enough and it always takes me a long time to clip my nails to a point where I like.  I found these on Amazon and love the design, plus how they keep all of the nails in the device with easy cleaning.  I would recommend this set to anyone looking for new nail clippers.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable to use. Very sharp &amp; accurately sharpened. Nail clipping catcher works great.&lt;br /&gt;Best clippers I’ve ever bought or used. Thanks</li>
    <li> I choose the 5 star because these cllippers are light weight, and are easily handled.  very nice top of the line ...</li>
    <li> The first time I used the clipper the handled broke off from the main body. What a waste of money !</li>
    <li> I ordered this hoping for a larger gap for thicker nails, but that is not what I got.&lt;br /&gt;The clipper is much larger than &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; clippers, but the nail gap is the same as all of my standard clippers.&lt;br /&gt;Made well, just not what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> These clippers are strong and sharp, but they don&#x27;t open up wide enough for thick nails, even though that&#x27;s  what it says in their description.If the opening was just a little wider they&#x27;d get five stars.</li>
    <li> My husband has thick nails and the regular nail clippers do not work properly for him.  He tried these and loved the way he was able to effortlessly trim his nails.</li>
    <li> It is my pleasure to tell you about Simply Essentials Best Nail Clippers. Our family had an opportunity to test drive the Extra Large size - they lived up to the packaging and product description. They certainly are strong, sharp, and wonderful for thick nails. These are my new favorite toe nail clippers. The Best Nail Clippers are well made and easy to handle.</li>
    <li> These nail clippers are well made and do a good job of cutting my toe nails and finger nails.  I like them better than the standard shorter nail clippers I was using before.  There is a hole at one end if you want to put a string on it for hanging it.  It has a sliding depth adjustment that I don’t use.  I took a star off my rating because these clippers don’t have a nail file.  I would recommend these nail clippers.</li>
    <li> Simply Essentials Stainless Steel Nail Clippers are a great! The nail clippers were delivered very quickly and well packaged. These fingernail clippers are made of high quality stainless steel and are ergonomically designed to fit the shape of your hand. The long handle on the clippers provide extra room for gripping so that the clippers won&#x27;t slip from your hand. The weight of the clippers is an indication of a precision tool that make fingernail grooming and manicuring simple. There are no jagged or sharp edges left after trimming, each uses gives a clean, even cutting and the results after the first few uses have been pleasing. I am a very satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> At my house, we have a lot of nail clippers spread in various drawers throughout the house.  But-there are only one or two pairs that work the best that everyone ends up using.  Now that we have the Simply Essentials nail clippers, there is a new favorite pair in the house!  These worked great on everyone in the family-nice and sharp, sturdy, and with a clipping catcher and edge guard.  Nice to not have nails flying everywhere as you cut them.&lt;br /&gt;Great one year money back guarantee!</li>
    <li> these nail clippers are great.  My husband has had a lifelong battle with nail clippers because&lt;br /&gt;he has the hardest nails on the planet. He has broken his fair share of nail clippers, so it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;nice to finally find a pair that work for him</li>
    <li> I purchased these clippers to use on my 86 year old grandmother since trimming her thick nails have proven difficult.  The clippers worked great!  They are large so they are easy to hold onto and trim nails so easily.</li>
    <li> It catches my nails after I clip them! I like that aspect of the nailclipper. Also it clips nails real good.</li>
    <li> these are the very best and easiest to use clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  They are extremely sharp, cut nails smoothly so they require little filing or smoothing.  I am so glad I found them.  Thanks.  A very happy purchaser.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with these clippers!  In no time at all my toenails looked nicer than they have in years!  Regular clippers had become useless on my thick toenails.  I will purchase another one for my Mother.</li>
    <li> Horrible - unpolished metal grinding on unpolished metal - sounds nice nails on a chalkboard.</li>
    <li> Good design and implementation to prevent nail pieces from flying about. Particularly good for thick and tough nails like toe nails.</li>
    <li> This large nail clipper is exactly what I&#x27;ve looked for over many years. I have very thick and hard big toe toenails and these clippers clip them easily. I&#x27;m more than pleased with them as they&#x27;re the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever had and I&#x27;m 75 years old.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a great clipper like one I used to have by La Cross. Apparently La Cross no longer exists nor do those clippers. These are just as good, great metal catcher, great size and even better material. Nicely done!</li>
    <li> Great design, smooth clicks to get nails trimmed and still versatile despite larger size.</li>
    <li> They are not wide jaw toenail clippers. The opening is not wide enough for thick toenails.  Sent it back. Great Customer Service!!</li>
    <li> My husband goes through nail clippers like water so he has used a lot of different kinds.  He loves these ones! Very sharp and sturdy.  The catcher for clippings is a great feature so I&#x27;m not finding the clippings all over the place.  At first, my husband wished there was an attached file but after using the nail clippers, he said that they make such a smooth cut that no file was even needed.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different brands, types, and makes of finger nail clippers and have yet to find one that I want to stick with! That is until I found these Simply Essentials Nail Clippers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Simply Essentials nail clippers are, what I would call, industrial strength nail clippers. They are stainless steel and heavy duty. They are nice and sharp and so they cut through my little monster&#x27;s thick nails the first cut and with ease! They are pretty large. However, the large size makes them easier to grip for me. Another awesome perk, they come with a one year guarantee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say that I have finally found the nail clippers that I will always purchase! If you want quality and functionality....then these nail clippers are the ones for you!</li>
    <li> These are great clippers! They are quite sharp and the long handle makes them really easy to use. The only thing that I didn’t really like was the attachment to catch trimmings. It didn’t stay in place when I was using it. Ultimately that was fine I just removed it and used them without. Great product!</li>
    <li> I have very thick and difficult to cut nails, and my hands are not very strong anymore due to diabetic neuropathy. These clippers work very well for me as there is less pressure needed (from the leverage.) I appreciate these very much and will continue to use them and purchase new one.  Thank you for these!</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;Extra Large&amp;#34; attracted me to this item.  My toenails are very thick.  While the item itself is large, the opening is the same size as any other clippers on the market.&lt;br /&gt;AND.....the side cover is a great idea for containing nails until they can be discarded, but falls open easily and still dumps the nails on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;I guess my expectations were not met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GW</li>
    <li> These are some nice nail clippers! I used them on my toenails so far and it was pretty much effortless to cut through the nail. compared to other nail cutters i have used these ones are unique as they have, what i believe is, a nail catcher. I though that was pretty interesting. I would recommend these nail cutters to anyone, especially those of you who have thick nails, as they cut very easily. happy with them.</li>
    <li> These nail clipper are large which is very helpful for toenails. The blades are sharp and easily cut through thick nails. I like the side guards that catch the nail clippings. I did find that I needed to empty it between each nail, but at least it kept the clippings in the trash and off my floor. The matte finish is very attractive too.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample for free in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> This is a great pair of nail clippers.  They are very sturdy and very strong!  After cleaning them after each user of course,  the clippers were used by an older member of my family for their toes and wow,  the clippers did a great job.  They were easy for my elder to hold and use.  The best part about the clippers is the fact that there is a detachable &amp;#34;pocket&amp;#34; to catch all of the clippings!</li>
    <li> Very durable clippers. Works well on the softest to the most stubborn, hard nails. Easy to grasp the corners of the nail which isn&#x27;t always easy. My husband has enjoyed them which helps keep him up to date on his stubborn toes!</li>
    <li> I’m not sure about everyone else, but my toenails are thick (not the gross thick kind, but the strong thicker kind) and they are sometimes hard to trim.  These nail clippers do the job nicely.  They are sharp and they cut through the nail easily.  They have a little catchall to collect the cut nails to be disposed of properly.  I love the way these work, the only small complaint I would have is that sometimes the catchall slides down easily while they are in use, but as long as I’m mindful of that they work completely awesome!</li>
    <li> These nail clippers are great! They work for both me and my husband and don&#x27;t &amp;#34;dull out&amp;#34; so no need to replace every other time my hubby uses them. They are strong enough for the toughest nails, and cut evenly enough for every nail type. I love that I never have to pick up his clippings either because these clippers have a clipping catch to keep his clippings off the counter or floor and make them easy to dispose of. Great clippers at a great price.</li>
    <li> Will easily cut nails that were very difficult to cut before. Now my wife is happy ehen trimming her toe nails.&lt;br /&gt;Great tool.</li>
    <li> Nails on my big toes have gotten thick as the years have passed and this nail clipper did an excellent job cutting these nails,  It was easy to handle so I could get a precise cut with little effort.  The side catchall is what I liked best, it was nice to have no clean up after cutting.  I like the design, the matte finish, and especially the one year guarantee.</li>
    <li> My husband has the thickest toe nails I have seen. He tried these clippers and no problem, cut right through them. He has broken all of the ones I&#x27;ve bought in the stores. This pair held up.</li>
    <li> This Nail clipper is excellent quality and works amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cuts even the toughest nails with ease, and leaves a smooth edge and not a rough one like some clippers. The little catch area to catch the cut nails is very convenient and sanitary. It slides open with ease to toss the caught nails in the trash. The blades are super sharp and it really and just overall an excellent product.</li>
    <li> These clippers are the best for toenails that I&#x27;ve tried.  They are very sharp and therefore easy to use.  No more battles with thick nails!  The storage area that the nails fall into is also a great feature.</li>
    <li> Works well for big toe but not as well on smaller toes as it is hard to get it over the toenail. It is lightweight which is a plus and not awkward to use from that standpoint.</li>
    <li> These clippers are definitely on the larger side. They offer a very sharp and easy to use cutting mechanism as well as a removable tray type attachment for catching the nail clippings. These clippers are better for harder and larger nails. I would not recommend them for ladies with smaller hands.&lt;br /&gt;The design is sleek and appealing to the eye as it has a brushed metal look. The clippers were just not exactly effective for my smaller fingers although my dad appreciates them for cutting his larger, harder toenails.</li>
    <li> This was advertised as being bigger for toe nails that were overly thick. But it only opens as wide as the standard clipper you could get at any drug store. So it was useless my nails that had thickened due to a fungus problem. The only thing &amp;#34;bigger&amp;#34; about it was the physical length of the clipper.</li>
    <li> If you have ever used a pair of nail clippers from the local drug store you may have noticed that they are of a pretty low quality. At least that was my experience. So I went to Amazon to find a pair of clippers that were of higher quality but still at a sensible price. These nail clippers are far more superior than the clippers you will find at your local drug store. They provide a crisp, clean cut to the nail using very little pressure. The clippers also have a metal sleeve attached which serves as a catch for the clipped nails. The sleeve is easily removed for emptying/cleaning purposes.</li>
    <li> I like that these nail clippers have an extra long &amp;#34;body&amp;#34;, which makes them easier to grip. They are pretty sharp too, which is nice, because I only have to cut each nail once, not go back and re-clip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These would make a great gift for the guy(s) in your life, or anyone with hard to trim nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already tossed our old nail clippers!</li>
    <li> Good quality. Works fairly well on thick toenails.</li>
    <li> If you have thick nails or have a husband who does, these are the BEST clippers to get! My husbands toe nails have broken a few of our clippers. It aggravates me to no end to buy a new pair of clippers and then have them break on his nails. Not only is this a heavy duty pair of clippers and you can see they are large.&lt;br /&gt;These nail clippers have a handy nail clippings catcher. This catch all is very easy to empty. Just pull back the stainless steel piece and viola! Great to grab if you have those heavy duty nails!</li>
    <li> A little big and not as sharp as I thought they would be but work ok</li>
    <li> These are great toenail clippers.  Very sharp, which makes cutting through tough nails a breeze.  Plus, the catcher was an added bonus!  No more finding my husband&#x27;s errant toenails on the floor near where he clipped....these clippers have a catcher that catches the toenails and holds it securely until he dumps them in the trashcan.  Good, sturdy, strong, sharp clippers.</li>
    <li> I used these clippers to cut my finger nails and they worked fine, the true test will be when my husband needs to trim his toe nails. The edges were a little sharp on the nail catcher so I just removed it.</li>
    <li> My husband gets mad b/c I clip my nails in bed. I try to clean up the clippings but I inevitably forget a few,----which he finds at 3am by rolling over on them. (whoops). Problem.solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing rocks! It contains the clippings in the clipper itself and then you can just shake them out when you are done. It&#x27;s heavy duty, and easy to maneuver. I like that it&#x27;s not slippery too like some of the others I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also nicely made. It&#x27;s well constructed but not heavy. I&#x27;m not sure how they accomplish this, but they do. I will be buying a few of these.</li>
    <li> My husband actually took them to use on his own toenails since they are strong enough to handle his and he can get a nice, clean precision cut! The cutting edge is ultra sharp and ensures nails are easy to cut. Great new style with satin matte finish, includes catchall for clippings and a edge guard. Professional nail clippers. Heavy duty design. Includes one year guarantee. These would make a great Father&#x27;s Day gift!</li>
    <li> DAYUM. These are some industrial nap clippers, folks. They are huge. It&#x27;s the nail clipper equivalent of Frank Barone&#x27;s remote control. I mean, what kind of diet are you on where your toenails are hard enough to need these jaws of steel? Just, straight iron? Do you take shots of volcanic lava and rinse it down with titanium? Are your toenails made of diamonds? I guess you need this device then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to repurpose things. I&#x27;ve been needing a new can opener.</li>
    <li> Stainless Steel Nail Clippers. Heavy duty, easy to handle and hold unto. The finish on the Stainless is a matte finish, making it easier to hold unto. The sliding nail clipping catcher is easy to slide back and empty, I appreciated this feature.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older my toe nails have gotten thicker and my ability to reach them harder.  So I went looking for a tool to help solve my problem.  I found these clippers after reading reviews on the others available and ordered them.  I am so glad I did.  These are heavy duty and the extra length is just what I needed.  Plus they are extremely sharp, cutting my thickest nail in one try.  Would highly recommend to anyone with thick nails.</li>
    <li> Product works as advertised.  Clippers are big and functional</li>
    <li> sent it back. they call it wide but was narrow opening</li>
    <li> Heavy duty construction, wide opening for thick nails, sharp product.These cut through my husbands this toe nails very easily! Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Very well built and sturdy clippers</li>
    <li> These are awesome.  Nice feel and very sturdy.  I like the elongated handles.  Nice that the tips of the cutters are rounded so that you can&#x27;t accidentally cut your skin.</li>
    <li> These clippers have a very high-quality brushed stainless steel look, and I LOVE the little side catchers that prevent the clippings from shooting all over the room. My husband usually clips his nails over the trash can, which rarely makes a difference because they fly everywhere anyway, but these clippers help keep them contained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are not terribly ergonomic (very flat with hard edges so there is no place that your finger settles naturally) and so big that they are a little difficult to use on kids (though I can&#x27;t fault the product since that&#x27;s not what they were designed for...just something I observed). Overall a great product, especially for men and anybody else with thick or tough nails.</li>
    <li> Prior to embracing a gluten-free lifestyle, I had a lot of issues with my hair, skin and nails.  My hair had thinned out considerably since my youth, my problem-free skin began to break out in mysterious rashes and my nails, once strong and fast-growing and the envy of both my mother and sister, became brittle and slow-growing.  Once diagnosed Celiac and put on a gluten-free diet, my hair began to thicken again, my skin cleared up and my nails once again became strong and nearly impossible to cut.  Add to that joint stiffness and loss of strength due to years of rheumatoid arthritis, cutting my nails became a difficult and time-consuming chore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that my nails have returned to their original health, I realized my old nail clippers just weren’t going to cut it.  My toenails are particularly thick and clipping them has become a formidable task even after soaking them in soapy water for several minutes.  So I decided it was high time to get a new pair of nail clippers.  I got the opportunity to try out a pair by Simply Essentials and they really did the trick.  Not only did they cut right through my toughest toenails, but they did so with little effort and in the first try.  Instead of spending the usual 10 minutes cutting my toenails and fingernails, it took all of about two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These stainless steel clippers are huge, yet they are very light in weight and easy to grip.  And the fact that they cut on the first try and save me more than half the time it originally took makes it well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Wholy clippers!  These are very useful.. Especially for those thick big toe nails!!  I used them on my husband and they worked wonders!  No more toenail bending and fraying of the nail!  The nails came off with ease!  Ergonomically... It is nice to have a large apparatus that is sturdy in your hand.  I recommend these to anyone!  IThey are so strong, I wanted to test them on my dog but I don&#x27;t want to risk breaking them!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> These are by far the best nail clippers I have owned.  I use artifical nails sometimes and usually the clippers I have used bend the nail, but these just clipped cleanly, no bending. They also feel very sturdy and strong.  I am sure I will be using these for many years to come.</li>
    <li> This clipper is the only one I have ever used that clipped my hard toe nails on the first pass. Usually it takes a couple cutting nibbles from the side but this clipper made the process easy and painless. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> These clipper are very well made. They are pretty big, so they have been great for my husbands toes. I can see them lasting for years and years.</li>
    <li> I have had nail clippers as a staple on my &amp;#34;things to buy&amp;#34; list for years.  Honestly, I just pick up a pair any time I think about it because my husband breaks them constantly.  This is not going to be a problem anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried when I first opened the box because they were so light weight, I thought there was no way they&#x27;d hold up.  Now, after several uses, I&#x27;m convinced they will!  The blades are surprisingly sharp and cut through cement-like toe nails without even flinching.  I&#x27;m very glad I got these!!</li>
    <li> These clippers are easy to  use - real easy to  clip. They cut thru thick nails no problem, only problem is if your nails are too thick, they won&#x27;t fit in the opening. Otherwise, no problem.</li>
    <li> These nail clippers by Simply Essentials are large, which is very helpful for cutting thicker toenails.  The large handle makes it easy for those with hand strength issues or arthritis to operate.  The blades are sharp and easily cut through thick nails. The brushed stainless steel has a nice look, so if you are giving them as a gift the recipient should be pleased. The company offers a one-year guarantee, which I think is awesome - it shows they stand behind their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> These are string clippers for even the thickest, toughest nails. I would recommend them for anybody.  They work great and do a wonderful job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> Very impressed by how cleanly and evenly these clippers work. Nice smooth edge on every toenail and easy to press.</li>
    <li> Best clopper I have ever had.  The clippings retaining metal clasp is hard to remove.</li>
    <li> Great Nail Clipper! I like the cover that collects the nail ends. It IS the size of TOE nail clippers and bigger than finger nail clippers. It easily cut my toenails and my finger nails. I like the brushed steel. It is very sharp and cuts easily, no tearing like my old ones, which are going in the trash. These are nice! Work great! And they shipped very fast.</li>
    <li> Nice solid nail clipper. Works well to trim my fingernails. Good leverage on the bar when cutting.</li>
    <li> We have been happy with these clippers.  They are nice and sharp, and cut my nails easily, leaving behind a nice edge.  Will definitely buy these clippers again (just as soon as my husband loses these, which he inevitably will).</li>
    <li> Love this clipper!!  it is a solid piece of metal; nothing flimsy about this; the clippings go into a separate container for easy disposal - no more clippings on the floor; the blade is sharp.  Would highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> These are the only clippers I&#x27;ve found that will cut a thicker than average toenail.  Price is right, seems well made.  Works better if you slide the clipping catcher part back before using.  I&#x27;d recommend these to a friend.</li>
    <li> High-quality clippers - they are so lightweight, but really sturdy. They are way more precise, and cute more firmly, than any other clippers I have used. Good investment!</li>
    <li> I will admit to not really liking these at first, but upon a second try, I really like them!  I am used to using small clippers (that is what I use with my children so they are usually the ones most easily accessed).  It takes little effort to cut even the big toe nail.  I even tried cutting that hard plastic on toy packaging - and it worked (now that is pretty strong!) They close up easily.  They seem to be constructed in good quality material as well.  If your looking for some clippers, these are a good choice!</li>
    <li> These are definitely clippers for thick toe nails. I didn&#x27;t need them, but someone in my life sure did, and they&#x27;ve done the trick. They were gentle, easy to grip, and include a catching tray. The stainless steel finish is a great touch to prevent rusting and gunk from building up. I expect these clippers to be around for a long time to come.</li>
    <li> Pretty Good Clipper.  These look sleek and fantastic and they are a joy to hold.  They feel like real metal and have a sense of elegance as if hearkening from a different era.  Thoughtful design went into these and who&#x27;d have thought you could improve on a clipper?  Fun to use.  There is a catch for the clipped toenails to go into and, while it does make the clean up a snap, it does create a limitation that I have run into: sometimes, not all the time, this catch also acts as a guard, and you can&#x27;t get a big enough &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; on the nail, and so the only way to correct this is to pull the guard back, and that seems a little inelegant.  As I mentioned, not all the time.  Other than that, a nice item - I recommend - better than your standard nail clipper for sure.</li>
    <li> These clippers are really nice.  I really like the design and I love the extra piece that keeps the clippings inside for easy disposal.  nothing worse than toe nail clippings flying across the room and this really prevents that from happening!</li>
    <li> I received these clippers in the mail yesterday and not a minute too soon. I seem to have misplaced my toe nail clippers. The chore that these had in store for them was fierce! I was pleased to see that these clippers were up to the task. They cut through my nails with great ease. I might even say &amp;#34;like butter&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;My wife would also like to point out that they were able to cut through her gel polish encrusted toenails with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;Remember to take care of your nails,  before they take care of your socks.</li>
    <li> I must say that this is the shapest, longest, widest clipper I ever had.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to clip my toenails.  I cannot give it 5 stars because the ad states that it works on thick nails.  Unfortunately it does not work on seriously thick nails due to a fungus infection.  I got it for my husband hoping it would work but the opening for a thick nail is not wide enough.</li>
    <li> My husband and 2 sons agree with me that this nail clipper should be rated 5 stars!  The best part is that it catches the clippings so they are not left on the floor!  It is heavy duty and seems like it will last a long time.  I hope so!</li>
    <li> Really does work on thick nails. Very sharp too, has good cutting leverage.</li>
    <li> These are great clippers.  They are perfect for thick nails.  One of the best features is the nail catcher.  It is so easy to empty the clippings into the garbage.  I appreciate the fact that it will catch the nail clippings.  This is going to go into my beauty stash and when I share it with my husband and kids, I will make sure that it is returned to me.  Very sturdy and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Nice design, really nice cut, the only issue was that the clipper opening was not large enough to accommodate my fat toenails.&lt;br /&gt;However I found a work around that I am pleased with. I would recommend this clipper.</li>
    <li> needed them larger recommend to no one  not worth the money  very disappointed in product and size looked very cheap</li>
    <li> The previous reviewers who said that this product isn&#x27;t larger than average must be shopping at some store for giants that I&#x27;m unaware exists... because I have multiple pairs of clippers and NONE of them are nearly as big as these. They are definitely a high quality product that feels sturdy and dependable. They cut smoothly and cleanly and are easy to use. I highly recommend these clippers for anyone considering them.</li>
    <li> I was doubtful about these when I purchased them but they are awesome! Great quality build! Takes care of my toenails in no time compared to other smaller clippers.</li>
    <li> They cut my husband thick thick toe nails like theu were splicing through butter! No fighting to get them to cut those thick nails! Will he getting another pair for this offshore bag!</li>
    <li> I have never spent more than a few dollars on a pair of nail clippers. Usually I get just the cheapest one I can find at the drug store. And of course, after a few months of use, those cheap clippers break. I have never been so impressed with a pair of nail clippers before! They are a solid, high quality stainless steel product. They just feel better than the ones I usually use. I love the gripper ridges that help with leverage. The catchall is a plus! I had a little difficulties with the catchall at first. You have to slide it up under the screw firmly in place, but once it&#x27;s in place, it does an excellent job of catching all the clippings. I don&#x27;t have particularly thick toe nails, so I can&#x27;t comment on their ability to cut thick nails, but they work beautifully for me!</li>
    <li> These nail clippers really are huge and are the most sturdy, yet light weight, clippers I have used.  My old clippers were getting dull and starting to crack my nails as I trimmed them.  This clipper is so much stronger and sharper that I felt like it clipped my nails like butter!  I like that it is bigger than other clippers as well.  I was able to trim both finger and toe nails with more ease and more comfortably (I didn&#x27;t feel like a contortionist getting my toe nails).  These are the best nail clippers I have ever owned!</li>
    <li> I gave these clippers to my husband to use, he has some thick toe nails (the big toenail)  When he use it, he was surprised how well they cut through the nail, they have more torque than the average nail clipper, I think it is because the clipper slides.  Would definitely recommend to buy, especially for men.</li>
    <li> Nail clippers are nail clippers, right?  NO!  These are fantastic!  I have very thick toenails and I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding clippers that will easily cut through a thick nail.  So many of them slip, or you can&#x27;t get a good grip but these are solid and fit nicely in your hands. And the fact that it has a &amp;#34;catcher&amp;#34; for the clippings is fantastic!  No more flying clippings that end up on the floor, only to stab you in the foot later on.  I&#x27;d recommend these, for sure!</li>
    <li> Best clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  And durable.</li>
    <li> I had hoped for a nail clipper with a larger opening, suitable for cutting thick toe nails. I already have a nail clipper much the same as this, bought at Boots. What is needed is a larger clipper with a much larger opening</li>
    <li> These are really nice quality nail clippers.  They clipped everyone in my home&#x27;s nails without any issues.  They are comfortable to hold and easy to push down on.  My husband has had issues in the past on nail clippers that were able to clip his toe nails and I am happy to say that we have finally found a pair.  Just one clip and done!  I like the idea of the clippers catching the clippings but I didn&#x27;t find that it worked all that well.  It was easy to get clogged and hard to fit the thicker nails into the slot to cut them.  I still give this item a 5 star rating because they cut better than expected.  The quality of these clippers are also better than I expected them to be.  Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> I have been plagued with thick toenails for several years and have tried many different brands of clippers with varying results; none of them as successful I would have liked.  I bought these clippers and have finally found a brand that works efficiently and with surgical precision.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> Not really different from wha you could buy for less in a drug store.</li>
    <li> My husband has terribly thick toe nails and this clippers makes keeping his feet well manicured easy. The opening for the toenail is wider than most standard clippers making it easy to accommodate thicker toenails.</li>
    <li> The clippers are great--a sharp, crisp cut. I appreciate the thought that went into the spare but good-looking design, too--unusual in the world of toenail clippers!</li>
    <li> These clippers are solidly constructed, and sharper than any others I&#x27;ve tried.  They have ridges which allows for a better grip for your thumb and fingers.  Unique to any other clippers I&#x27;ve seen, they have an adjustable length, which makes it easier to hold them.&lt;br /&gt;I would have liked them better if they were a bit wider, but the product still deserves 5 stars.  I think they are very durable and should last a long time.</li>
    <li> My husband has extremely thick toe nails and until we tried this product, it was difficult for him to clip his nails.  He is very pleased with the product and their customer relations.  Highly recommend this company and their customer service.</li>
    <li> These clippers are sturdy, well-made and get the job done. The clipper stays sharp use after use. If you are in the market for clippers, this model is worth every cent for practicality and durability.</li>
    <li> My husband seems to like them.  He said that he hasn&#x27;t had a whole lot of a chance to use them, because of the cold weather his toenails are not growing very fast.</li>
    <li> great clippers for thick toe nails...fast shipping..mdse as good as advertised....super guys.....</li>
    <li> Not sure about these yet. Wife says they look great. I only use these to do my toe nails. Last pair I had for about 6-7 years were a finely finished major brand. These are not shiny polished metal. My only real concern. If I don&#x27;t update after using, figure they work well.</li>
    <li> This clipper did a great  job on my thick toenails!!!</li>
    <li> These were horrible!  The first time I tried them they didn&#x27;t trim my toes.  The second time the fell apart!</li>
    <li> to much of a curve on it an not a big enough opening for a thicker than average toe nail. live an learn.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these nail clippers on my fingernails only, which aren&#x27;t terribly thick. However, they did a great job cutting cleanly across my nails and not leaving any jagged edges. The nail clippers are fairly lightweight compared with others I&#x27;ve used in the past, but that does not correlate with any shortcoming in function - they are very sturdy, cut nails well, and are easy to grip despite their large size. The only reason I did not rate it 5 stars is the tray on the bottom that holds the nail clippings rattles around a bit (even when empty). Seems it is not attached as well as it could be.</li>
    <li> This nail clipper does the job.  It&#x27;s sharp and it has a nail catcher!  Didn&#x27;t realize how dull mine were till I received this one.</li>
    <li> Love These Clippers!  I have limited use of my hands and always had a problem holding the nail clipper.  Not anymore!!!  These clippers are awesome and a pleasure to use - minimum pressure to clip, great nail catcher and they cut so sharp and neat I didn&#x27;t have to use a file to smooth my nails. I am impressed with these clippers and really happy I bought them.</li>
    <li> This nail clipper is better for fingers than feet. The nail slot is so close and narrow that it is difficult to insert a toenail. The blade is sharp and cuts cleanly.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again since I had toenails in mind.</li>
    <li> I never thought there was really a difference in nail clippers but these are definitely superior to what I used to use.  The clippers are attractive and very sturdy, easy to hold and use.  They trim my nails and my kids&#x27; nails easily and cleanly with no rough edges.  My girls have stopped complaining when I trim their nails because this product makes it so quick and easy to do. We use it for finger nails and toe nails.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I got these for my husbands thick toenails and they worked great. The cut across was smooth and not jagged. The handle can be adjusted for hand comfort.</li>
    <li> The Simply Essentials nail clippers are very high quality in function and looks.  I have had many cheaper clippers and they do not compare with them; for the few dollars more they cost, you will have the best and you will not be disappointed.  I am an experienced comparative value shopper and found that the Simply Essentials clippers from Castle Rock are the best for value for function and price. Also, the delivery was prompt.</li>
    <li> Best toenail clipper I ever used. NO hassle or extreme pressure at all in squeezing it to remove nails very, very easily. I would most definitely use this seller again. Prompt delivery. UPDATE June 3, 2016. Since my original purchase, I have gotten two more. One as an extra and another as a &#x27;prezzie&#x27; for my daughter. These clippers go through toenails like a hot knife through butter...melted butter! This seller is the real deal. A company that honestly wants YOU to be satisfied no matter what. Please get a couple of these because it will save you time later...because you WILL want two and will want to pass it on to your family members!</li>
    <li> Terrible clippers. Not any wider than regular ones. Don&#x27;t work well on thicker nails!</li>
    <li> It is a very sturdy clipper, but had to return it because the opening was still too narrow for thick nails.</li>
    <li> used once and they broke.</li>
    <li> Great for my huge ingrown  toe nails !</li>
    <li> So I have what some would call monkey claws. And these clippers are amazing. Cut right through my giant claws.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I&#x27;ve gone through several cheap convenience-store style nail clippers, and these are definitely worth the investment. They&#x27;re so tough and durable the I think the only way to break them is with an iron nail. Would definitely recommend to anyone with thick nails.  The only reason I&#x27;m tempted to give 4 stars instesdof 5 is due to the excessive emails from the seller. While I like that they&#x27;re checking up on me to see if I have any problems, I don&#x27;t appreciate their request for me to write this review.</li>
    <li> my husband really likes these clippers.</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;ll be honest and admit that I don&#x27;t have particularly thick toe nails. This product caught my eye because I use artificial nail tips, and I can&#x27;t cut those with regular clippers, and the thumb tips are too wide to fit in my &amp;#34;official&amp;#34; artificial nail clippers. I had been using regular clippers and kind of hacking away at the tips until they would fit, and it was frustrating and tedious and half the time resulted in mangled nails. These work great! I can have the artificial tips cut in two snips. There hasn&#x27;t been any dulling of the clippers, and I&#x27;ve grabbed them to trim my kids&#x27; nails (even the baby!) and they work perfectly. It is a sturdy but lightweight product, and should anything happen to the ones I have, I&#x27;ll certainly be reordering.</li>
    <li> These nail clippers are very sharp, so be careful when using.  The only problem is that I have to push the clippers onto some of my thick toe nails before trimming.  It does a good job when I do this.  Perhaps the opening needs to be a bit wider to accommodate thicker nails. The little tray is supposed to trap the trimmings, but I have yet to find one in it.</li>
    <li> These Nail Clippers by Simply Essentials are excellent. They are very sharp and have a nice feel to them with brushed stainless&lt;br /&gt;Steel. The neatest part about them is they have a clippings catcher.  When your done with your nails, you just&lt;br /&gt;Simply pull back on the sides and dump out your clipped nails</li>
    <li> I feel silly reviewing a set of toe nail clippers, but I have to brag about these! We had been having the same old pair of clippers for years. When I saw these, I decided to give them a shot. The little tray on the bottom catches all the nail clippings and makes the task simple and easy. They&#x27;re extra sharp for nail clippers (or maybe our previous pair were just that old!). This is a great buy!!</li>
    <li> I have very thick toenails, so when I saw this product especially designed for &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; nails I was happy.  I ordered it, it came on time and when I used them, great.  It is very sharp so you have to be real careful, but everyone should be pleased to get their toes clipped.  I am a diabetic, so I have to be very, very careful with my toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again Castle Rock Essentials Product, Inc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely.&lt;br /&gt;Ava M. Washington</li>
    <li> Heavy duty construction,wide opening for thick nails.These cut through my extra-thick nails with ease! Very good product.I would by these again in a heartbeat!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed when I first saw my new Simply Essentials Stainless Steel for Thick Toe Nails clippers.  It didn&#x27;t look any bigger than the too-small toenail clippers I already had. But when I tested the new clippers with my thick toenails, it handled cut them easily.  The opening between the blades is a millimeter or so more than for standard toenail clippers, just enough to make what was a frustrating task easy.</li>
    <li> The these are not just for men as the description indicates.  They are extremely sharp and give a clean clip and do not slip not out of your fingertips.  I have very strong nails and I had no problem using them.  These are the best clippers I have found and the price is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Linda D.</li>
    <li> Excellent Nail Clippers, is the best I&#x27;ve had, Very pleased with this purchase</li>
    <li> These nail clippers basically do the job as promised. Good for thicker nails as they have a large gap and are extremely sharp. Love that they have a feature that collects the nails after cutting.Size is about the same as other large clippers I have purchased. They are sturdy and good quality.</li>
    <li> They cut very well but can&#x27;t accommodate very thick curved nails.</li>
    <li> These are excellent clippers, more suitable for large hands/men than for smaller women. They&#x27;re exactly as advertised, cutting cleanly and leaving no ragged edges. My husband has been wanting a good pair of clippers for a long time and the ones in stores around us are always lacking...these are NOT lacking in any way. The price is excellent for such a good product! Thanks to Castle Rock Essential Products, Inc.!!</li>
    <li> quality! I have purchased tens of these and this is the best one. Why? They are sharp!</li>
    <li> I have the thickest toenails,  this cuts them perfect.  most toe nail clippers i have to press very hard and twist to get through my nails,  these cut easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dropped a very thick man hole cover on my toe.  i almost lost the entire to,  the name came off,  once it grew back it came back at what seems like about the thickness of 3 nails.  its very thick,  as a result i have always had problems.  these clippers really worked well.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for large toenails, and I’m putting them to a use that most people don’t need:  getting rid of the extremely thick big toenails that come from receiving chemotherapy.  They work great!  They also come with a nail clipper catchall that you can slide up so it is tight, then it will catch the nails, or just take it off if you want.</li>
    <li> Works great. Easy to use. Feels good in hands</li>
    <li> No better than regular clippers.  Sort of misleading, and disappointing.</li>
    <li> Advertised as thick nail cutter. Could not open them wide enough  to cut my nails. Evidently, not for everyone!</li>
    <li> These nail clippers have a nice wide opening  for easy clipping, work just as they said it would.&lt;br /&gt;They are heavy duty and have not found anything like this before, very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I love the nail catcher feature, it&#x27;s super practical</li>
    <li> These clippers are some of the best I have used.  They are quite rugged and feel very beefy, but are still lightweight.  They are ultra sharp and cut through toe nails very easily.  The brushed steel and ridges on the clippers make a huge difference when clipping nails after a shower.  I have much more control with these than I have with my chromed ones.  These clippers are not for the thickest nails however,  but are among the best for normal nails.  I was provided this product for inspection and review.  My review is based solely upon my personal use and assessment of these nail clippers by Castle Rock Essential Products.</li>
    <li> Life is much more than toe nail clippers, but these were a roll of the dice and it paid off.  I like the balance between quality and ease of use.  It is hard to explain the quality of material, and nice results with clipping the nails.  Simply a nice product.</li>
    <li> So far love these as they cut toenails with ease and precision</li>
    <li> excellent just what i was looking for</li>
    <li> My husband lost his prior pair which he purchased in England. I needed to find a replacement. These are great! They get the job done and he seems happy with them.</li>
    <li> Wow. These work great. All this time I&#x27;ve struggled with clippers which seemed big and strong, but these are also sharp. What a difference.</li>
    <li> Jaws did not open wide enough for my thick nails.Alright for ordinary nails.</li>
    <li> THEY WERE OK  FOR CLIPPERS OPENING NOT WIDE  ENOUGH FOR THICK TIE NAILS  PUT THEM I&#x27;M PILE WITH OTHERS</li>
    <li> crazy crazy crazy sharp &#x27; i&#x27;ve had other&#x27;s but not like these cut&#x27;s right thru the tuffest nails</li>
    <li> These clippers are lightweight, very sharp, and easy to use for both fingernails and toenails. I would recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> The product information stated that the clippers would open wide for thicker toenails.  They don&#x27;t.  Then I gave them to my wife and she won&#x27;t use them either.  She says her old clippers that she thinks are getting dull still clip better than these.</li>
    <li> came apart before I could use them.</li>
    <li> These clippers cut nails just fine, but it come with a slide-on piece of metal that slips around while cutting, quite dangerous.  After messing with it and pushing it out of the way a few times, I finally realized I could remove it from the clippers and managed to slice my finger as I was getting it off.  Its purpose is unknown to me, but the clippers are better without it.</li>
    <li> I got these because my husband has tough toenails and these clippers cut them easily. The nail catcher doesn&#x27;t catch all the clippings but that is not a problem for me. They are well made and don&#x27;t slip out of my fingers like some other ones do.</li>
    <li> ok, but will cut your toe if not careful</li>
    <li> Great size, cut extremely well, and the side-cover system is awesome. Don&#x27;t have to worry about having something to clip your nails into or cleaning up after. Just cut and then slide the sides open and dump into a trashcan. Great product, great idea.</li>
    <li> First off? These things are massive. I&#x27;ve attached a picture of them next to some regular clippers. They&#x27;re huge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have small fingers and used them just fine. They&#x27;re nice and sharp and make a nice clean cut. I trim my finger nails A LOT - long finger nails creep me out - and these are some of the best quality I&#x27;ve used. I would buy them again if offered in a smaller size. The packaging was very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little basket to catch the trimming is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in order to review it.</li>
    <li> Sturdy as described I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star because it could use a nail file, but no other complaints</li>
    <li> Was very disappointed in this product. I could not tell any difference in this one and any others that I have bought at a local drug store. Save your money.</li>
    <li> Great buy, it works like a champ</li>
    <li> Clippers are impeccably crafted and easy yo use.  A fine product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a caregiver, and really appreciate the sturdy, &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; feel that the clippers have.  Will definitely order again, when needed.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find my large toenail clippers so got on Amazon to order some new ones. I&#x27;m SO glad I lost the old ones because these are hands-down the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever used! I have nerve damage in my hand and it&#x27;s really hard to clip my nails but these are super sharp and require very little pressure to use. Glad I got them!</li>
    <li> This clipper is nice and hefty in the hand, and feels like a solid, sturdy construction. I like the shape of the blades, and how sharp they are. This doesn&#x27;t split your nail when you cut, which is a huge problem with others that I&#x27;ve had right out of the package! I&#x27;ve had some trouble with the nail catching feature not catching all the nail clippings, but it doesn&#x27;t take away from it&#x27;s solid performance. (and hey, the others in my drawer don&#x27;t have that feature at all! better some than none at all, right?!) Overall, I would recommend for your personal hygiene collection!</li>
    <li> These nail clippers are the sharpest and strongest clippers I&#x27;ve ever had. Def a great purchase that I would recommend to anyone. Great for thick toe nails.</li>
    <li> These are the best toe nail clippers I have ever used.  They are strong, sharp and wide enough for even my highly curved toe nails to fit easily into the slot for clipping.  I highly recommend these clippers to everyone.  A great product.</li>
    <li> Love it, made nail clipping so much smoother and easier for me.</li>
    <li> Finally a toenail and fingernail clipper that works perfectly. Super sharp, good leverage and a clever sliding cover to keep trimmings inside until you are done. I am buying more for my siblings. I have had so many second rate clippers over the years. This is the best.</li>
    <li> The seller rushed this item to me.  A nice quality, large, nail clippers.  It is the same size as any other &#x27;large&#x27; size clippers. In fact, the &#x27;gap&#x27; between the blades was actually less than the more common national brand.  I was hoping for something for thick, curved toe nails of an adult male.  Save your money, get the large size at Walgreens or Walmart for about 3 dollars.  NOT ACCURATELY DESCRIBED!</li>
    <li> The sidewalls slide front to back and allow you to catch all your snipped finger and toe nails, very useful for those that like to keep a clean house.  Ever since I bought these I haven&#x27;t found any unexpected clippings around the house despite my college-minded roommate.</li>
    <li> They are no bigger than the ones I already have</li>
    <li> Works better and is sharper than other clippers I have bought.</li>
    <li> I love the Castle Rock Essential thick toe nail clippers. I was surprised how well they worked. I do not have a lot of strength in my hands  and these clippers really did the job. I have ordered three and will be ordering more for friends and family.</li>
    <li> These clippers are very sharp and comfortable to hold. They fit around thicker nails with no problem. For anyone that is thinking of giving them a try.......go ahead, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Very Misleading Descrption. Opening not even as large as my other toe nail clippers. AVOID !</li>
    <li> These are sharp and long enough to provide leverage to cut those thick toenails.</li>
    <li> The clippers were received promptly and we were quite surprised by their performance.  It it finally nice to have a pair of clippers that can actually clip through tough nails and the added bonus of the clippings catcher.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was getting very frustrated trying to clip my very thick toenails.  I decided to look for a more heavy-duty pair of clippers.  Used them this morning and was able to clip all of my toenail.  Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> The nail clippers are a good sturdy quality but the opening was not that much bigger on the clipppers I have been using.  It worked on one nail but the other was too thick for these clippers.</li>
    <li> The clippers aren perfect for arthritic hands.  I have no problem hold them while I cut my nails.  They are also perfect for thick nails.</li>
    <li> Simple effective design, very sharp and easy to use. It is a little expensive but if the sharpness lasts a long time it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> These are by far the best nail clippers we have tried.  We operate a cat shelter and clip their nails regularly.  Most clippers crush the thick cat claws instead of cutting them.  But these clippers are definitely up to the challenge!  Works great on our staff&#x27;s nails also.</li>
    <li> Sturdy clippers. Product arrived on time as promised. These are heavy duty clippers for thick nails, with a sharp blade. The ridges on the &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34; provide a nice grip. Large enough to do the job, but small enough to conveniently store. Great product.</li>
    <li> These clippers are great! I used them myself then my boyfriend (who has really thick toenails) used them and they worked so much better than the clippers we already had. These are definite keepers and will be used regularly. The only thing he didn&#x27;t like was the &amp;#34;guard&amp;#34; around it, but I liked it.</li>
    <li> These nail clippers are super heavy duty. They clipped my nails with extreme precision and ease. They are heavyweight, high quality. You can&#x27;t find clippers like these in local retail stores. They even chopped my husbands nasty thick toenails with ease!! Would be great for people with toenail fungus.</li>
    <li> These nail clippers are the perfect thing for clipping your toes. I hate when I use smaller clippers and my big toenail ends up taking 3-4 &amp;#34;clips&amp;#34; to trim my nail. These clippers work great in just 1-2 clips. I love that the stainless steel is brushed. It makes the clippers look much sleeker and not like the cheap drugstore brand. I had a bit of trouble getting under my very dainty toe nails (other than the big toe), but these were great for all 10 of my husband&#x27;s toes. The quality on this seems great and I expect these to last a long time. I love that it has a toenail clipping catcher, though when I first opened the package I was unsure what the extra piece of metal was. My young son loves to clip his own nails, but tends to send the clippings flying. I am hopeful this may help with that. Overall, this seems like a solid product and with a year-long guarantee, there&#x27;s no risk to trying it out!</li>
    <li> Nice heavy duty, quality clippers. They leave the nail edge nice and clean, not rough and jagged. I use them to cut both my toe and finger nails and they do the job perfectly. I am very picky about my clippers and used to only buy Tweezerman clippers and these fit the bill. I am very happy with the quality of these and I&#x27;m positive I&#x27;ll have them for a very long time, unless I lose them. lol</li>
    <li> These clippers are lightweight and easy to use for thick nails whether it be toes or fingers for males or females.  Large clippers are easy to hold and easy to use!</li>
    <li> This is the first &amp;#34;nicer&amp;#34; nail clippers that I have owned.  It actually catches all of those annoying nail clippings so you don&#x27;t get them everywhere.  It has a nice brushed finish, and cuts easily through thick nails.  I need to check to see if this company makes finger nail clippers as well.  I&#x27;ve been hiding this one from my family, and may have to order more just so I can share.  :)</li>
    <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, this is the best nail clipper I have ever owned. It  is very sharp, and seems likely to remain so for some time. Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> These heavy-duty toe-nail clippers were purchased for my out-of-town brother, and he seems to be very pleased with the clippers!</li>
    <li> These clippers are just great! At just shy of 76 my hands...particularly my thumbs...have severe problems with arthritis and I was having no luck using the smaller clippers. I just couldn&#x27;t get the leverage I needed to make a clean cut anymore. AND, believe it or not, I was actually having even more trouble with flying nail clippings. I decided it was time to buy some new clippers and I&#x27;m so happy that I did! These clippers are super sharp and large enough to give me the leverage I needed to cleanly clip even my toughest toenails, catch all of the clippings and feel comfortable in hands. They are even sold at a decent price. If these clippers were around, I should&#x27;ve bought them a long time ago.</li>
    <li> I think these are amazing! I love just the concept of it collecting the scraps as I normally chase them down if they fly! I have very small fingernails, so these worked perfect as toenail clippers for both me and my daughter. They are sharp, make clean cuts, and are well built. Great quality. Now if I could convince my husband to use them, they would be perfect.</li>
    <li> I have never owned a strong stainless steel nail clipper before. Most often, my manicure sets cost what this single clipper does. I wanted to see what all the fuss was about over high-end clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails are thin and split easily. They love to frustrate me by fracturing into rough edges after every clip. I wanted clippers that curbed these problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The greater leverage on these larger-than-normal clippers helps me make swift and precise cuts. The sharp blade means that my nails get \\&quot;cut\\&quot; instead of \\&quot;chewed\\&quot; by the clippers. The stainless steel construction will keep the blades sharp for a long time. The clippers&#x27;s wide mouth makes it possible to use the precision, sharpness, and leverage on polished nails, which can be a bear to cut with regular clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Measurements:&lt;br /&gt;* 3 inches long&lt;br /&gt;* 0.6 inches wide (with the catch for the nail scraps on)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I am putting this clipper to a different use. My indoor cats and ferrets have sharp nails. I am using this clipper to blunt their claws before the claws snag on the carpet or their bedding and snap off to leave ragged ends. The wider mouth of this clipper makes this project possible. And, because the clippers are stainless steel, I can sanitize them in alcohol without worrying they&#x27;ll tarnish or rust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I do not like about the clippers is the catch for the nail scraps. More often than not, it does not catch the clipping in the hollow at the hinge of the clippers. In addition, the top edges of the catch are dangerously sharp, and they parallel the grip of the clipper. I advise removing the catch (It slides off) and using the clippers without it.</li>
    <li> not used much yet but  ok so far.</li>
    <li> These nail clippers are fabulous. They cut through the thickest strongest nails with ease. They are really sharp so they will cut fast and easy the first time.They are really durable and well made. They have a nice grip on the handle to clip your nails. These are great and a must have to have a strong sturdy nail clippers and these will last a very long time. and I was so happy I had the opportunity to receive this as a gift to share my experiences with it.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my wife who has very thick toenails.  She said they are EXCELLENT, easy to use, and very sharp.  She has tried various &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; clippers, scissors, snippers, etc none of which worked well - and most weren&#x27;t strong enough to cut through her thick nails.  She is very pleased.  Great product for a very reasonable price.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my golden retriever.  I have been clipping the tips of his front paw nails since he was a pup.  My regular clippers didn&#x27;t open wide enough.  These were perfect and a heavier quality.  Best way to clip dog nails, much less likely to cut into the quick.  Don&#x27;t forget the treat afterwards!</li>
    <li> The handle is longer than the usual clippers, which contributes to it&#x27;s effectiveness in cutting through nails without requiring a lot of force.  The blades are quite sharp.  They are easy for my husband to handle in spite of moderately severe arthritis in his fingers.</li>
    <li> These nail clippers were able to cut through my fiance&#x27;s very thick toenails easily and the nail clipping holder that is built in is an awesome addition. No clippings shooting out all over the place! Great product!!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this purchase, good value</li>
    <li> I love how long the handle is! It makes it so simple to cut through those thick toenails.  My husband has always had problems trying to cut his toenails, but the sharpness of these clippers made it almost effortless!  We both highly recommend these nail clippers.</li>
    <li> work as advertised, quick ship.</li>
    <li> It worked well for me. I hate bending so much to trim my nails. This nail trimmer has a longer handle than what I&#x27;ve used in the past. I like that it has a trimming collector. That side moves back and forth to collect trimmings. I did get this product for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> The description says that these are pretty heavy duty, and are great for people with thick nails. I do not have thick finger or toe nails, but I still really liked these. The handle is quite long, which could be helpful if you have a hard time reaching your toes. The clippers are very solid and sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the catch guard is a great feature - it collects your clippings the way a hole puncher collects all the paper you&#x27;ve punched. That way, you don&#x27;t end up with clippings all over the place, that you need to clean up after you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, these are very sturdy and seem to be a great quality, and the catch-guard is a cool feature.</li>
    <li> I expected it to be larger than the standard toe nail clippers but it isn&#x27;t. It doesn&#x27;t have a quality feel.</li>
    <li> These are really nice. They have an attached nail catcher so they don&#x27;t go flying everywhere. The clippers are also very sharp and easily cut through thicker toe nails. My husband even commented on how nice they were compared to an old Walmart cheapy purchase.</li>
    <li> I got these mainly for my husband, but I also use them myself. He said they do a much better job than regular clippers especially on his toenails. They were very easy to use and seem very sturdy. The large size made it much easier to hold them. I found that it worked great for my toes, but (as expected) was a little bulky for my smaller hands. I wish the attachment (meant to catch the clippings?) stayed in place a little better. We removed it and that made it work much better.  Disclosure: I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I have not been compensated in any way, nor promised any future promotions. I have no affiliation with the company at all, and I am not required to leave a positive review. All thoughts are my own and have not been influenced.</li>
    <li> We have searched for strong nail clippers for a long time.  Some of my family member have nails of steel, these clipped them with easy.  Great purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought these toenail clippers because I lost my Klip Pro toenail clippers that I bought also from Amazon.  Bottom line is that I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in these.  The clippers are more suited to fingernails.  The simply can&#x27;t handle toenails because of their size and the width of the opening of the cutting area.  Further, the clippers can&#x27;t be hung anywhere because the clipping arm covers the hole intended for hanging the clippers up.  Odd bit of engineering design that&#x27;s problematic for storing these.  Also, the clippers have an odd metal shroud that I suppose was suppose to serve some purpose more than having the name of the maker stenciled on it.  For me it just collected dirt and made the clippers hard to clean.  I took it off and pitched it.  There is a positive ending to this review and that is Amazon delisted the Klip Pro product and I bought it promptly.  I&#x27;d strongly recommend the Klip Pro product for a good sturdy, well designed, and effective set of toenail clippers.</li>
    <li> The best nail clippers</li>
    <li> works as well as normal clippers, only costs 3 times as much</li>
    <li> Great product.  Captures all clippings.  Cuts through nails easily.  Really like the feature that allows easy clipping removal.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the purchase of these nail clippers.  Have strong nails and these have done the trick!  Would highly suggest them!</li>
    <li> I purchased these clippers recently and have been very satisfied with my purchase.  They are very sharp and really do the job.  I would definitely purchase them again.</li>
    <li> did not open wide enough</li>
    <li> My husband loves these! They are very heavy duty and easily cut through thick toenails. There is a guard for safety so you don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting off too much or cutting your nails too short. I recommend these clippers!</li>
    <li> The biggest feature of these nail clippers that in my opinion make these stand out from the rest, is how sharp they are.  In fact I don&#x27;t think I have ever had  pair of nail clippers that effortlessly clipped my nails.  Finally, clippers that don&#x27;t bend my nails while trying to clip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the nail catcher compartment, however (and to no fault of the product) only works as good as gravity can hold.  So if you clip your nails holding the clippers parallel to the floor, then bingo...you clip away then you simply slide the compartment, give it a few shakes and finally no more clippings all over the place!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers are not any bigger than any standard toe nail clipper, but they sure do clip better than any clipper I have ever had.  They are extremely sturdy and well made.  I would recommend these to anyone!</li>
    <li> Big toe nail, big clippers, and the clips don&#x27;t go a flying....</li>
    <li> Larger than most nail clippers.......cuts easily and easy to handle for my big hands,. Highly recommend !</li>
    <li> These are wonderful, functional, sharp and not only good for thick nails but any nails I think. They seem like they will last for a lifetime.</li>
    <li> I must say, I am very impressed with these clippers. They have a nice look to them, with stainless steel and a matte appearance. They grip well, and most importantly clip the toughest nails accurately and with ease. My last pair of clippers required me to fight with my big toenails, use both hands and push as hard as I could - I have some TOUGH nails. These clip easily with a very easy motion and are precise enough that they do not leave jagged edges. I do not need to file my toenails after use. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love these clippers.  They are extremely sharp and have a slide on the side to keep the clippings from flying everywhere.  I have moderately thick nails and they cut my nails with no problem what so ever.  I would recommend being careful with them as the are very sharp and could easily snip your skin, if you are not careful.</li>
    <li> High quality, heavy duty.</li>
    <li> I received the Extra Large Nail Clippers from Amazon earlier in the week and immediately used them.  They are the real deal; I was able to successfully clip my big toenails for the first time in more than a year.  The other toenails have not been a big problem to cut but the two big toenails were so thick I could not cut or clip them with other clippers and/or scissors.  I am happy to say now all my nails are neat looking.  Thank you for a great product.</li>
    <li> extremely rough and unpolished steel, uncomfortable to cut nails with. the touch of it feels like scratching a chalkboard.</li>
    <li> I purchased the clippers because they were supposed to have a larger than normal opening for thicker nails. Upon receiving the clippers the opening seemed to be the same  as any other brand. Tried them and didn&#x27;t do anymore than my old cheaper clippers.</li>
    <li> Great clippers for those of us with arthritic thumbs.  A wonderful and thoughtful product.  Bill King</li>
    <li> indicated they were big..just normal clippers...very sorry buy</li>
    <li> These are a bit clumsy to navigate but much more effective than the traditional clippers we had before. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Very high quality clippers, but not satisfactory for my needs.  Thick toenails require a larger opening than is provided by these clippers.  There is no question these are made well.  They are easy to grip, and provide good leverage.  I need to go back to the scissor type clippers for my personal needs.</li>
    <li> This product was bought for my husband. His toes have thick nails. According to him they work better than the other nail clippers he uses.</li>
    <li> Clippers are nice and sharp for clean nail cuttings. Doesn&#x27;t trap as many nail clippings I had hope for but more than with a regular clipper.</li>
    <li> These clippers are amazing! They are very durable, have more leverage than any other I have used. The opening is a bit bigger to make thick nails easier to trim. Can be used with or without the nail trimming catcher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> My husband has super thick nails, and these clippers clip right through them in a breeze. Also nice that the clippings fall inside so clippings are not flying everywhere, just pull down side to empty. Can also pull side down to make longer for more leverage, although so sharp and easy to use, I don&#x27;t see needing it, but a clever thought.</li>
    <li> This clipper works well! It especially works on the thicker nails that I have on my toes. It cuts with a nice sharp click. What I like the most is the nail catcher on the sides. One of my biggest pet peeves is nail clippings.  Just pull back and empty over trash can. This is great!</li>
    <li> What a nice pair of clippers!  We&#x27;ve tried so many over the years... you never know what kind of quality you&#x27;re going to get when you buy clippers.  These are nice and SHARP!  I am surprised at how easy they cut.  Like many couples, we have our &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; spread out over a few locations (house, boats, trailer).  We&#x27;re already arguing over who gets to keep these clippers and where!  I can see I&#x27;m going to have to order more to keep us both happy!  Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> I have just purchased these and I already like them a lot. They came as described, and they&#x27;ve worked well so far. The price was pretty good for them as well.</li>
    <li> Great nail cippers. Excellent quality, they can trim the smallest sliver of nail and strong enough to do a tough job. Best I have ever used. Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Good price for well made excellent clippers. Does what it claims.</li>
    <li> These clippers rock. I have nails that are tougher then an iron railroad spike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers are are strong, cut perfect and actually don&#x27;t throw the clipped nail in some direction and make you go on a scouting mission to locate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars for this simple reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers are perfect. Everything about them is great. Only concern is that I&#x27;m a tall guy. Taller then most with big hands. The clippers are kinda difficult to work with,  but when your my size good luck finding anything to work well as if your were a smaller dude..... but overall great item.</li>
    <li> The opening of the clippers was not wide enough.to trim our toe nails.</li>
    <li> These are a serious pair of nail clippers! I was pleasantly surprised when these arrived at how substantial they are. The sliding casing over them is amazing at catching all the clippings and empties easily. They are very sturdy and well made. The casing also prevents nipping skin or tender paws. I am very happy with these clippers. Well worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> these were for my grandmother with toenails like steel. these work great.</li>
    <li> These are top quality clippers! I love the design and feel of the stainless steel. They clip with ease and do not require much pressure. My husband especially likes the extra long handle and sharpness to cut his extra thick toenails.</li>
    <li> Finally a nail clipper that I&#x27;m not afraid to let the men in my life use. No more nails on my bathroom floor. Hooray.</li>
    <li> For the first time in my life (50+) I have my own lovely nails.  These clippers cut my nails off rather than crush them off.</li>
    <li> These clippers worked great! I liked not having to search for the clippings afterwards. I always like how they are more of a brushed metal than a shiny metal.</li>
    <li> Great, heavy duty nail clippers.  Love the compartment that catches the nail pieces once they&#x27;re clipped.  They work super well on both my child&#x27;s super thin nails as well as my much thicker nails.  I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a new nail clipper!</li>
    <li> Great nail clippers!  They feel sturdy when using them.  My nails are a bit thick, so I worry that a clipper will not do the job unless the nail is first softened, but these clippers worked just fine!  I have broken other nail clippers in the past on my husband&#x27;s nails, but these held up great!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> These are great for toenails, super sharp and heavy duty. I see these clippers lasting a lifetime. The stainless steel makes them a bit heavier, which is nice to have something to grip and not fall out of your hand. Well made product, I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic clippers for the price. I love the wider gap between the blades and the clipping catcher.</li>
    <li> very cheap stainless steel, poor spring action&lt;br /&gt;Not very good and very expensive&lt;br /&gt;The less expensive models are much better clippers and values&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from these</li>
    <li> These nail clippers for Thick Toe Nails works great!  Very sharp and cut&#x27;s my husband&#x27;s thick toe nail easily!  Also a bonus cause it collects the clip nails.</li>
    <li> Clippers do the job on thick toenails,and are sharp.</li>
    <li> These clippers are great.  The wider jaws make thicker nails short work.</li>
    <li> I really dislike writing negative reviews.  These clippers were no different than any other pair of clippers.  They did not standout as being THE BEST TOENAIL CLIPPERS.  They did not work at all for me.  A complete waste of my money.</li>
    <li> We just tried the nail clippers for the first time.  I have very thick&lt;br /&gt;toenails, especially the big toe, but these clippers cut them with ease.&lt;br /&gt;We are very pleased and will definitely use them in the future.</li>
    <li> Best nail clippers i have found! I was looking looking for a pair of  nail clippers for my husband he has really thick toe nails and with regular clippers its impossible, they either chip the nail or does&#x27;, nt to get a good cut with regular clippers , these clippers gave a good cut and no chipping and it has a built in nail clipping compartment which is very convienent .when your looking for clippings on the floor and it&#x27;s gross too . You just open the compartment and drop in the garbage, much more sanitary. I would recommend these clippers for anyone that has thick toe nails and are dieabetics! I received this gift for my unbies and honest opinion.</li>
    <li> My husband must have the thickest toe nails on planet earth.  He is partially disabled due to cancer and other health issues, so I cut his nails among other things.  They cut quite well with some pressure once I can get a grip on the nail.  The nail catcher doesn&#x27;t work for me and virtually useless, but probably because of the nail thickness. They still fly all over the place.  I would really like to see an adjustable clipper designed for nail thickness, but have not seen anything like that on the market yet.  Also, no nail file and not happy about that.  I didn&#x27;t notice that on the purchase, because it is usually a standard part of the clipper.  They work for now and better than any other I have used so far, so I will continue to use them until something better comes along.  Also think it is a little overpriced by a couple of dollars.  I paid 12.00, but think about 10.00 would be more like it.</li>
    <li> Fancy pancy but just a regular nail clipper. Looks good cuts well, nice long press down plank give you good leverage. Recommended.</li>
