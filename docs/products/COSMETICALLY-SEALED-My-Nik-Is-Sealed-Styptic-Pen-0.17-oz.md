<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great, does have a bit of a sting to it on application — I thought the point of this newer kind was so it wouldn&#x27;t sting. Oh well, works great though.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had to use it yet- but gave it five stars in the hope that when the day comes that I nick or cut myself- it will work as advertised.</li>
    <li> This sounded good according to your description but in actuality the roller ball gets stuck beginning with the second and each one.thereafter!also,it applies too little styptic!</li>
    <li> love it I have already used it and it worked fantastic. Easy to carry in purse. Very fast delivery thank you</li>
    <li> So awesome. First cut stopping product I&#x27;ve ever had that works! Stops bleeds instantly. Fantastic! Cannot recommend more. Better than any cream or pencil.</li>
    <li> Glue for skin yes it burn&#x27;s a little but be a man and suck it up cupcake</li>
    <li> My dad was searching for a styptic pen replacement since his old one stopped manufacturing years ago. We tried this and it works as advertised. Stops the bleeding instantly. Gives a slight &#x27;burn&#x27; when applied, but tolerable. No residue. Love the roll-on application.</li>
    <li> i ordered this product because they said it leaves no white residue,they were right it didn&#x27;t, but what they didn&#x27;t say was...it stung like the devil and that&#x27;s no exaggeration this stuff really stings. it didn&#x27;t just sting for a few seconds it stung for a few minutes. i&#x27;d rather put up with the white residue.</li>
    <li> This product is so much better than a styptic pencil, or even an alum block.  The only one I&#x27;ve found that actually \\&quot;stops bleeding fast,\\&quot; even though they all claim to do so.</li>
    <li> If you shave and you have ever gotten razor cuts, this is essential for you. It does what it says and I have never found anything to match it. Simply apply it and the cut is blocked! Amazing!</li>
    <li> This will close the shaving areas and will end the problem of bleeding and will aide in healing. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> My husband had a roll-on styptic purchased several years ago, and when it had run dry we were unable to find the product anywhere.    I purchased four My Nik Is Sealed pens and my husband was absolutely thrilled. While working on projects he often experiences skin breaks which bleed and this product works great!  He can keep one in several places for convenient use.</li>
    <li> Reading through so many double-edge safety razor reviews I stumbled on this product recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried other styptic pens to compare but when I nick myself shaving I roll this on the cut and it immediately stops the bleeding. It does burn but I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s a better solution. I imagine it will last me a good long while and I particularly like the roller-ball application method.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a lot of ears now.  Couldn&#x27;t find it locally so I tried my search engine on-line and whata ya know, I found it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Works very  good on cuts betterthanoldfashioned septic stick</li>
    <li> These are the questions I had before purchasing MNIS, and got it simply on other people&#x27;s recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q. Does it work?&lt;br /&gt;A. Yes, it stops bleeding from minor nicks and cuts instantly. Much quicker, easier, and better than styptic pencils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q. Does it leave residue?&lt;br /&gt;A. No, your face will have no white marks where you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q. Does it sting?&lt;br /&gt;A. Yes, a little bit. It&#x27;s not unbearable in the slightest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q. How long will it last?&lt;br /&gt;A. A very long time. One little dab/roll of the product seals off the nick instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q. Is it really worth this much?&lt;br /&gt;A. Yes. It works well, leaves you looking clean, and is a better alternative to traditional styptic pencils.</li>
    <li> Product works reasonably well and stops the bleeding from smaller nicks and cuts from shaving. I didn&#x27;t particularly care for the roll on applicator as sometimes it would get stuck, overall a good product that does as advertised.</li>
    <li> So much better that a styptic pencil</li>
    <li> Was delivered fast and it does the job...doesn&#x27;t leave the white powder mark of a styptic pencil...does sting a little but you expect that from a cut.</li>
    <li> Great Product and service would recommend to anyone. Thank U</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re on blood thinners or heart medications of any kind you know how even the smallest cuts can take forever to stop bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;This is a must to have on hand. It&#x27;s sealed so can be carried in your pocket or purse. Use over and over not just a one time thing.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy and cost effective. We have more than one so each person can have their own and a spare for emergencies.</li>
    <li> Stings just a little, but stops the bleeding instantly.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great, but you can get the same result from a normal styptic pencil for way less money.</li>
    <li> Works well, does not take much, less burn than pencils and less messy.</li>
    <li> Another great product ordered on Amazon with prompt delivery!!!!! Very satisfied with quality, service and price!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Works great to stop bleeding and covers the spot with a coating. Best shaving blood-stopper I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Stings when you put it on but it did somewhat stop the bleeding.</li>
    <li> I could not find this product in our local store so I bought it on amazon.  Works great when you are in a hurry and need to get out the door.</li>
    <li> Much better than steptic pencils to stop bleeding.</li>
    <li> Yes it stings a bit, but it does it&#x27;s job well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that it does leave a plastic like film over the cut, but it&#x27;s usually safe to rub and remove the film after 15-20 mins of applying the ointment.</li>
    <li> As you may see, I am a verified buyer of this product as of last month. Long story short, this product has left a red mark/scar on my face that is going on three weeks now. Based on the positive reviews, this product must work for some, but for others, it is downright dangerous. I invite the company that sells this product/manufacturer or Amazon to contact me. I have used a regular steyptic pen and have not had this issue. Beware.</li>
    <li> I am a double edge shaver.  Hard to get a closer shave.  Periodically there is a nick to deal with. This is handsdown the best product to stop the bleeding instantly.  Once you apply it your done.  Feel free to apply after shave. The bleeding won&#x27;t resume.</li>
    <li> I have looked high and low for a product like this in the stores to no avail.  I was just able to find the styptic pencils which I find messy.  With the Styptic Pen the products goes where I need it and not all over my fingers.......thank you.</li>
    <li> Stops the bleeding immediately without the white reisdue of regular styptic pencils. Really like that it will be great for traveling</li>
    <li> Easy to use as a roll-on</li>
    <li> Not sure how cosmetically it seals blood, but the roller out of sight,oit of mind seems to work</li>
    <li> This pen is the bomb!  Stops the bleeding instantly.  Expensive but worth it.  Have two- one for home and one for the road.  10 times better than a messy styptic pencil</li>
    <li> Works great &amp; stops bleeding on small cuts fast.</li>
    <li> You bet I like this. I hate the taste of styptic pencils. Yuck.  This solves the problem without that horrible taste. It doesn&#x27;t leave white spots and may sting a little after a while, but so does everything else. Do I recommend this product. Yes, yes, yes.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as good as Nik Aid. I have to keep washing the cut to get it wet and apply this 4-5 times before it will stop the bleeding.</li>
    <li> This is a nice replacement for a styptic pencil.  Does the trick and doesn&#x27;t leave white residue everywhere.</li>
    <li> No more toilet paper.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to sound like a baby, but when you apply this to a shaving cut, it stings badly, and the pain lasts a long time.  It also made the area around my cut red for a few hours which made me look weird going to work.  Plus I think other products are more effective at stopping shavng cuts from bleeding - at least for me.  Can&#x27;t recommend this one.</li>
    <li> after several applications, it finally stopped the bleeding, after I nicked myself shaving. A lot of bother.</li>
    <li> This product stood up to its claims of stopping the bleeding the first time with no secong application. It did what it was supposed to do unlike a lot of items.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I couldn&#x27;t find a Pinaud Dab On and this is actually a better product.  The first time i had to use it I really, really needed it.  After being over served at the local public house the night before i woke up late, and more than a little shaky.  I really shouldn&#x27;t have been using anything sharp, especially not near my face, and i paid the price with two nasty gashes on my chin.  My Nik sealed them up tight with just a few applications over a few minutes.</li>
    <li> I use an alum block after shaving, but that only stopped the bleeding on only the smallest of cuts. Occasionally I&#x27;ll get a slightly larger cut that I just can&#x27;t stop from bleeding. The toilet paper thing never worked well for me -- constantly falling off and not doing a whole lot to stop the bleeding. This thing works great! It&#x27;s got a slightly astringent smell to it, but certainly nothing that would deter using it. It may take a few seconds to work/dry so you can&#x27;t just throw it on then immediately wash your face -- but after 20 or 30 seconds you&#x27;ll be good to go. I haven&#x27;t had any cuts that this hasn&#x27;t worked with!</li>
    <li> Works well and is convenient. I use it on my face occasionally and the only objection is to the scent. It is not scented, but only smell like the chemicals that make it up, which is a bit off putting when it is on your face where you can readily smell it. Not the worst, or a deal-breaker, but an observation. It is an effective product though.</li>
    <li> The best!  Works like a champ.</li>
    <li> It really works! Easy to use and a great value!</li>
    <li> Since being diagnosed with AFIB, I have been on blood thinners. This makes even small cuts bleed profusely. I thought I would give this product a try and have been more than satisfied with it. Just roll it on (a little stinging at first) and the bleeding stops. No residue.  It&#x27;s small enough to keep in my purse for emergencies.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It stings plenty, but it does the job when you slice yourself. Reliably seals razor cuts and stops the bleeding.</li>
    <li> Works great for someone switching to double edge razors.  I&#x27;ve never used a styptic pencil before, but I like that this dries clear and doesn&#x27;t leave visible marks!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Works much better than other syptic pencils I&#x27;ve used. If you&#x27;re a man who shaves regularly, this is a product you should have.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a klutz and seem to have little places that bleed a lot. Usually not large enough to need a bandaid so this works great!</li>
    <li> as advertised--Well packaged --Very quick shipment! Thanks</li>
    <li> Every guy that shaves needs to get this product! I&#x27;ve been using it for years but finally ran out of the last one I had but counldn&#x27;t find it (of course) in any of the grocery or drug stores here in Houston, Texas! So I searched it on Amazon.com (Thank You Again!) and couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes when I found it Awesome!!!&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
    <li> At least I won&#x27;t bleed to death anymore. Shaving knicks are a pain and happen oftetn.  Cosmeticallhy sealed: My Nik is Sealed Stypic solves the problem quickly and easily. Also very effective.</li>
    <li> This product helps with cuts as well as oozy pimples - sounds gross but lets be real and help each other! It really helps alot!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m constantly nipping my cuticles and often cut myself -- this product is just what I was looking for.  First of all, it&#x27;s styptic in liquid form as opposed to the messy, hard to use pencil.  Secondly, is comes in a handy purse-size roll-on container.  I used it for the first time tonite when doing a mani and it worked lightning fast.  Love it, will definitely order more in the future!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Seals minor cuts immediately and does not seem to leave the residue of the old syptic pencil types.  With the roll top, the application is also much easier.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised.  Stops bleeding IMMEDIATELY.  Stings like hell.  Be forewarned.  With the instant blood-stopping comes the cost of the pain, heheh.</li>
    <li> GET THIS IF YOU SHAVE! Burns a little bit obviously, but does its job even if its more than just a little nick... keep it handy and you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised,  seals niks fast and effectively. I&#x27;ve tried styptic pencils, but none of them work as well as this. The only down side is the smell, it&#x27;s like a mix of maple syrup and urine ... and that&#x27;s kind of a problem for me.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery! Everything intact.</li>
    <li> Very good, does what it says it should do. It will dry your skin so only use it on the area affected</li>
    <li> My husband introduced me to this when he nicked himself shaving his beard,  and I&#x27;ve used it for years whenever I may do the same when shaving my legs- it&#x27;s stops bleeding immediately, and as an extra benefit it doesn&#x27;t sting or leave a sign of itself like styptic pencil does!  I am so glad to have found it- try it ladies, and tell your sweetheart about it if he doesn&#x27;t know it already!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the Nik Is Sealed Styptic Pen months ago, but haven&#x27;t had occasion to use it. I finally gave myself a good nick while shaving. The little roller ball is a terrific applicator. The clear liquid stings pretty good for a few seconds, then settles down. The shaving nick stops bleeding immediately, which is the whole point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figure this little tube should last me about 10-20 years at the present rate of consumption. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> this stuff just plain WORKS.  i&#x27;ll have these in my den for the rest of my days and would even buy a ten pack to last me then next 50 years.</li>
    <li> works great! smell a little odd though. I use a safety razor and this is good to have on hand</li>
    <li> This is very easy to use and it does a good job sealing up the rare shaving mistake.  It rolls on very easy and is more compact than the blocks.</li>
    <li> I rarely make it threw a shave with out nicking my self around my mouth, and I&#x27;m a bleeder. I also collect pocket knives, and cut myself fairly regularly. And, I kicked a door the other week, and broke off most of my left big toenail. These styptics are great for all of these eventualities.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product and Service</li>
    <li> I like it when a company thinks outside the box. That&#x27;s the case with the manufacturer behind this product. Unlike ordinary styptic pencils, this roll on doesn&#x27;t leave a mess behind. With the styptic pencil that I was using prior to purchasing this, it wasn&#x27;t just messy trying to seal up the wound, it was even more so when storing it. The plastic storage container was just slightly larger than the styptic pencil itself. While it did come with a couple of air holes, they were all but useless, as the pencil would stick to the side of the container, like glue. This made it very inconvenient to remove. Yes, I tried wiping the pencil dry prior to storage, but that in itself ended up removing a good portion of the ingredient from the soft pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, while this product is more expensive than a regular styptic pencil, it&#x27;s a lot more convenient to use. You simply wipe the wound dry, than roll on the &#x27;My Nix Is Sealed.\\&quot; It does sting when you use it, but it only does so for a second or two. The wound is instantly sealed, leaving no residue behind. Just like a container of roll on deodorant, once complete, you simple put the top back on and you&#x27;re done. It comes with a screw on top which ensures no leakage when stored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that this product works exactly as advertised and is easy to use and store. I give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> My husband is a bleeder so this product is used often for shaving nicks.  He panics if it isn&#x27;t available.</li>
    <li> looks great its a awesome product no complains here.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  My brother used it for years since he can&#x27;t seem to shave without cutting himself, and I&#x27;d borrow it from time to time if I nicked myself when shaving my legs.  I&#x27;ve also used it for paper cuts, and even used it on our dogs!  It stops the bleeding immediately (yes, it stings a little bit) and unlike a chalky styptic pencil, it&#x27;s nearly invisible.  Even though it comes in a tiny container, it lasts a really long time.  When the local drugstore stopped carrying it, I was so happy to be able to find it here on Amazon.  It arrived very quickly and my brother was thrilled to have it again.  If you haven&#x27;t used it before, you can order with confidence.  You&#x27;ll never want to be without it for those (ouch!! gotcha!!) little shaving mishaps, or the occasional scratch or scrape!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff! Stings like crazy when first applied to the cut, but it doesn&#x27;t last but a moment and you&#x27;re no longer bleeding! Superb addition to your shaving kit. If it wasn&#x27;t for this stuff, there&#x27;s a good chance I would have given up on trying to shave the old fashioned way due to the amount of blood seeping from my face the first couple tries.</li>
    <li> Anytime I nick myself, I use this item to stop the bleeding.  It is miraculous in its immediate&lt;br /&gt;effect.  It does sting a little but so what. It works great.</li>
    <li> I have never liked styptics! They&#x27;re either to hard, to soft, sting to much, or just plain don&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The styptic pen, on the other hand, has proven to be an excellent product. And even though it still stings a little, it&#x27;s nowhere near as bad as the old styptic sticks.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. A little odorous- medicinal-like. Must dry face for best bleed stop. Stings a little even though the product says it doesn&#x27;t. Not bad though. Very convenient.</li>
    <li> Very convenient...does a great job.</li>
    <li> new straight edge user makes mom happy to have</li>
    <li> In every man&#x27;s shaving life a little blood will be spilled. And this is exactly what I need in those  times. Less stinging then my old styptic pencil.</li>
    <li> Stops bleeding from shave nicks/cuts  immediately and leaves no white film like styptic does. I would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> this stuff really works on small razor cuts.  It does however leave a white residue on your face which needs to be removed or it gets messy.</li>
    <li> The roller ball was stuck at first.  Once you get it unstuck, works as advertised!</li>
    <li> Pros: Quickly stops bleeding which I occasionally have as a new double edged safety razor convert. Knicks and cuts are immediately &amp;#34;cauterized&amp;#34;/clotted and the oily coating seals the cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Burns...like putting alcohol onto a cut. It does sting, but I guess that is how you know its working. It is not cmpletely hygenic because blood gets into the rollerball applicator. If the area get wet shortly after applying the &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; can open again.</li>
    <li> And that&#x27;s what you want it to do.</li>
    <li> My husband used a similar product for years but the company quit making it in the early 90&#x27;s.  He has been looking for something similar ever since.    I came across this product at Amazon and thought he would try it.  Not only does it look and feel like the original, it works as well if not better.      It is a clear roll-on liquid.  It does not sting nor does it leave a white spot on his face.  It is more of a soothing sensation that completely stops the bleeding immediately.  My husband can wash his face 10 minutes after using it.  It does not bleed or leave a red irritated place on his face.      I thought it was a little pricy at $5.49 for such a small container until my husband told me that he paid that same amount for a similar product in the early 90&#x27;s.  He still had a little of the old product left.  It lasts for years and never loses its strength.  It is worth every penny and he is thrilled to have his old product back.</li>
    <li> Seemed like a good idea, but the liquid inside glues the roller ball shut.  Finally threw it away after having to hold the ball under running hot water and hope it would break free.  Pity because I really wanted this to work</li>
    <li> When I read the reviews I was tickled to find something that might be better than the old styptic pencil. It just doesn&#x27;t work as well on my cuts. I really wish it did as it would be a great way to seal up those weepers if it did. Perhaps I am not using it right but I did follow the instructions. YMMV.</li>
    <li> This product is more convenient and more effective than standard styptic sticks.  One tube lasts a long time, but it is difficult to locate it in a retail store.  So order two at a time.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly as described and fits and works perfectly. Order processing, shipping, packaging were all excellent. I highly recommend doing business with this vendor.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works great. So much better than those styptic pens that you have to get wet. Well made product. Looks like one bottle will last over a year, probably several years.</li>
    <li> This product is not as good as the reviews indicate but has its purpose. Specifically, if you get a nick that is too much for the alum block type styptic, this pencil may be able to stop it without a bandaid needed. That makes it useful to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it is far from perfect. I&#x27;m dinging 1 star because the roller is inconsistent. I have to get it wet and roll on my hand for a while just to get it started. And -1 more star because the liquid stinks. Kind of like a mixture of lemon plus Tabasco sauce. If you&#x27;re going on a date or job interview, you might want to think twice about using this. Finally, it does leave a mark that&#x27;s visible close up, kind of a shiny patch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The competition here is NOT drug store type styptic pencils (which are awful and leave horrible residue) but alum blocks. For my part, I&#x27;m much happier with alum blocks ([[ASIN:B002JW8S6K Bloc Osma Natural Alum Block]] and surprisingly, [[ASIN:B000L998JY Crystal Body Deodorant Travel Stick 1.50 Ounces]] which works exactly the same). The exception is the rare serious nick that alum can&#x27;t handle and that requires this pencil.</li>
    <li> The few drops I could pry from the tube seemed to work well enough. Sadly, I didn&#x27;t get to experience the effectiveness of this due to the poor packaging. I&#x27;d used styptic pencils, but have now found the Clubman equivalent of this item.</li>
    <li> I recently switched to a HD type razor, and it is great. But I do cut myself every now and then, this styptic pen is the best. Stops the bleeding now. I think it is also a like a liquid bandage to help protect the cut. I will definitely by again.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite type of stypic. Sometimes however it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the traditional chalk. I wish more came in the bottle.</li>
    <li> This product works the way it is intended to. Seals nicks and minor cuts after you messed up.</li>
    <li> Works great. Stops bleeding almost immediately. Stings at first but that&#x27;s to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why not 5 stars? The smell is pretty strong. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll wear off quickly but, if using on your face, not something you really want to smell like fresh out of the shower or whatever. Make an odorless version and it&#x27;d easily be 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I was intrigued by some of the other rather effusive reviews about this product - especially the aspect of a styptic pen that left no tell-tale white residue and did not break apart.  The product works like roll-on deodorant - except, I had to press down hard on my wrist in order for the product to flow.  It also has a strong lemon smell - not necessarily unpleasant.  I thought that after an initial trial, the product would roll-on effortlessly when the time came round to treat an actual nick.  Five days after receipt of the product, the great event occurred.  Once again, the product did not flow and I had to roll it vigorously on my wrist for the ointment to flow (I thought that vigorously rolling the applicator over the cut might be imprudent).  The product initially appears to be invisible - albeit it takes on the appearance of glistening grease spot on the face.  Well, lo and behold, I look in the mirror twenty minutes later and there appeared the usual tell-tale white residue on the skin.  Also, my favorite styptic pen (not sold on Amazon.com, but purchased from a local apothecary) only stings after the initial application.  This product continued to sting for some minutes.  If you&#x27;re irritated by how the traditional styptic pen breaks apart, just be sensible about it.  My favorite brand is packaged in a lip stick styled tube.  I wet my finger tip, rub it on some bit of the detritus, and apply it to the cut.  Voila lazy bones, it works.  Don&#x27;t believe the hype of this product - it&#x27;s certainly not worth the incremental cost.  This producy, however, did stop the bleeding as advertised.  hence, the two stars.  But I give it a thumbs down for value, ease of use, and alleged invisibility of the ointment.</li>
    <li> I bought this after receiving a recommendation to do so from the book Gourmet Shaving and I have been very happy with it.  This works great for sealing nics from wet shaving.  I&#x27;ve also used it to seal small cuts on my hands/fingers.  It barely takes any effort at all to roll it over the cut and the bleeding stops instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think one tube is going to last me a long time as well so it really is a great value.  Great purchase, I highly recommended picking one up!</li>
    <li> Everything was as advertised and worked well.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE, WORKS WELL</li>
    <li> Found this is more versatile than the styptic pencil. The pencil ends up a little messy sticking in the tube. The liquid is cleaner and only a single drop is required unless you happen to really slice your throat.</li>
    <li> nice to have around when you cut yourself once in a while, really stops bleeding fast.</li>
    <li> Work great for nick with shaving</li>
    <li> The roller on my &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; arrived broken on two separate occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was the packaging recently changed? It appears as such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s unfortunate, because this is an outstanding product.</li>
    <li> I bought this from a recommendation from a friend as part of my foray into using a DE razor. Of course I cut myself on the chin but this product took care of it with little to no sting and no white chalky mess like a styptic pencil.</li>
    <li> This is much cleaner and easier to take with you than a regular pencil version. It doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue on your skin. It does sting on your cut, but that&#x27;s just part of it.</li>
    <li> Thus Seals all Shaving Cuts without the PAIN😩</li>
    <li> I shave with a traditional double edged safety razor with shaving soap and badger brush.  When the blade starts to dull, after several weeks (I store the razor in a glycerin/essential oil mixture to lengthen blade life substantially), I get several nicks on my neck every time I shave.  That&#x27;s my indication that it&#x27;s time to change the blade.  Well, I&#x27;ve used the traditional styptic pen (extremely messy) and the styptic cotton swabs (very expensive).  I stumbled across this while ordering shaving soap and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for six months now.  It&#x27;s the easiest of all options to apply (think mini roll-on deodorant) and leaves no visible residue.  It does sting when you apply it to your nicks but I&#x27;ve never found a true styptic option that doesn&#x27;t sting.  Just man-up and deal with it!  It works and I keep one in my bathroom and one in my travel bag as I&#x27;m in hotels 60-80 nights a year.  I hope they never stop making this product as I&#x27;ll buy it for the rest of my days.</li>
