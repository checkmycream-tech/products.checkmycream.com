      <li>:) I would purchase another one</li>
      <li>, I would most def reccomned it to many one looking for a cute case.</li>
      <li>The leather outer cover and inside velvet material keeps the ipad safe and snug.</li>
      <li>Overall, good looking case makes for a happy mom.</li>
      <li>I love the flap on the inside that secures the iPad.  </li>
      <li>Love everything about it.</li>
      <li>When I came across this case I automatically fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>the packaging was also done with love and care :-)</li>
      <li>I like how there is a handle to easily to hold the ipad while in use.</li>
      <li>I was also very pleased as to how fast this item was shipped and delivered.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery!</li>
      <li>it is so comfortable to hold.</li>
      <li>Works well and covers all important parts also meets our expectations.</li>
      <li>Sometimes she gets weary of carrying it around because she doesn&#x27;t want to look like she&#x27;s rich.</li>
      <li>Great price and lasted a long time.</li>
      <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
      <li>They are quite ergonomic and offer adequate protection.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so happy I ordered it it came in a few days and also included a free memory card.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the free by too.</li>
      <li>but it was worth waiting.</li>
      <li>It did take the allotted time but worth the wait.</li>
      <li>Material is well made and she absolutely loves it!</li>
      <li>It is also delivered very quickly, I ordered it on a Sunday &amp; it was delivered the following Saturday!</li>
      <li>I like it so much</li>
      <li>Even better than I expected</li>
      <li>Regardless, its still a very sturdy case.</li>
      <li>I am very impress by the quality of this leather cover for my ipad mini.  </li>
      <li>The material is very sturdy.</li>
      <li>I was worried it would be cheap material that wouldn&#x27;t last</li>
      <li>Just a heads up that with most PU leather anything has a distinct smell for the first few days, once it has aired it will disappear!</li>
      <li>One tiny problem I hope can get fixed is if it can allow the device to easily slip in and not slip out as much.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve looked all over to find a professional-looking leather cover case for my ipad mini and definitely found the right one!</li>
      <li>very sturdy classy look just wish it turned iPad off when closing otherwise like the case, like it a lot</li>
      <li>got little present with its which was a nice touch.</li>
      <li>The cover looks very professional, the shipment was prompt.</li>
      <li>I love the handle that allows you to hold it around your hand and also the stand with a little pocket attached!!</li>
      <li>Not exactly what I expected but its ok.</li>
      <li>i knew it was not a  real LV, but when you want to use the camera you have to remove it from the case because the hole was not cut properly, the same for the turning on your IPAD you have to push it in more, the cut out  was not cut properly.  </li>
      <li>When I was viewing the pictures I imagined more of an off white with grey, rather than milk white with grey.</li>

<li> Ships in a few days.</li>
<li> Does not fit snug.  </li>
<li> Like the case but not practical Ipad falls out or slips down and really not good for the iPad mini</li>
<li> Leather (probably fake leather) cracks up at the spine after a few months use.</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s not made to be secured blindly.</li>
<li> You will not be disappointed.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The product was delivered on time however the closure strap has begun to split and appears to be defective.</li>
    <li> Very nice case. Even better than I expected</li>
    <li> To describe this as leather is an overstatement.  There is minimal leather.</li>
    <li> Ships in a few days. But four months later. The leather isn&#x27;t holding up.</li>
    <li> Bought this case for my mom so she can carry around her iPad mini in style. Material is well made and she absolutely loves it! Sometimes she gets weary of carrying it around because she doesn&#x27;t want to look like she&#x27;s rich. Lol. The buckle part is handy as it keeps the case from opening up accidentally. However, I must add that it&#x27;s not quick to latch and unlatch, it does take some coordination so it&#x27;s not made to be secured blindly. Just a heads up that with most PU leather anything has a distinct smell for the first few days, once it has aired it will disappear! Overall, good looking case makes for a happy mom.</li>
    <li> I love my case! I was worried it would be cheap material that wouldn&#x27;t last but It&#x27;s very sturdy and not cheap material!! :) I would purchase another one</li>
    <li> Over all I love my cover for the mini iPad. The only thing I din&#x27;t like was the strap when you open it .</li>
    <li> very good quality, really recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> This product is really nice.  It did take the allotted time but worth the wait. Thanks for the free by too.</li>
    <li> Did not like the color.</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I expected but its ok.</li>
    <li> Leather (probably fake leather) cracks up at the spine after a few months use. Looks good otherwise.</li>
    <li> I am very impress by the quality of this leather cover for my ipad mini.  The price was excellent and I encourage anyone who is considering purchasing this item to do so.  You will not be disappointed.  I was also very pleased as to how fast this item was shipped and delivered.</li>
    <li> Good quality.  Fits iPad mini perfectly.  Could be a five star if you can pick your colors and/or patterns.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!!!!</li>

    <li> Excellent value. Exceeded my expectations. Quick delivery. My iPad mini fits perfectly within this case.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t fit my iPod!</li>
    <li> I did look at hundreds of cover cases and landed on this one I didn&#x27;t think that I would be as happy with this product but I am and I would happily recommend this item to everyone. So I bought two. They are quite ergonomic and offer adequate protection. It literally puts the suit and tie on your Ipad mini.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my iPad case!!  it is so comfortable to hold. I love the flap on the inside that secures the iPad.  I love the handle that allows you to hold it around your hand and also the stand with a little pocket attached!! it is just the cutest iPad case and I&#x27;m so happy I ordered it it came in a few days and also included a free memory card. I am very happy with my order and I&#x27;m very happy in how fast I received it. the packaging was also done with love and care :-)</li>
    <li> I got it for my daughter and she loves it. It protects her iPad mini and is fashionable.</li>
    <li> When I came across this case I automatically fell in love with it. It was the perfect pattern, with the perfect color combo. When I was viewing the pictures I imagined more of an off white with grey, rather than milk white with grey. That&#x27;s the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it all stars. I just has a different picture in my mind. Regardless, its still a very sturdy case. The iPad mini is perfectly in place, doesn&#x27;t peek out the sides like other cases and the material is surprisingly good. It is also delivered very quickly, I ordered it on a Sunday &amp; it was delivered the following Saturday! I like it so much, I would most def reccomned it to many one looking for a cute case.</li>
    <li> took some time for delivery. but it was worth waiting. good stitching. looks very elegant. got little present with its which was a nice touch. i truly recommend this product.</li>

    <li> Excellent service and great product!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> very sturdy classy look just wish it turned iPad off when closing otherwise like the case, like it a lot</li>
    <li> Great case... Took FOREVER to receive it.</li>
    <li> Vey attractive case. It does not reliably turn off the iPad however. You either have to push it down and listen for the click or else put the iPad to sleep with the on-off button.</li>
    <li> Came earlier than I thought. However, the case blue and white instead of the beige/tan color that is seen in the picture</li>
    <li> i like it . just as the picture.</li>
    <li> Adore this case!! Omg, amaaaazing!!!!</li>
    <li> Does not sit snugly in .. Shifts to one side</li>
    <li> The cover looks very professional, the shipment was prompt. I&#x27;m impressed by the quality of leather. The material is very sturdy. I&#x27;ve looked all over to find a professional-looking leather cover case for my ipad mini and definitely found the right one!</li>
    <li> Like the case but not practical Ipad falls out or slips down and really not good for the iPad mini</li>
    <li> I was very impressed; quality leather, nice blend of colors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with TOP! I use my iPad Mini cover all the time. Thank you</li>
    <li> great designer look.  Every one compliment me on this</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sooo pretty and very handy at times. One tiny problem I hope can get fixed is if it can allow the device to easily slip in and not slip out as much. But I still love it! :)</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price.</li>

    <li> Works well and covers all important parts also meets our expectations.</li>
    <li> Great price and lasted a long time.</li>
    <li> The untrained eye will not know.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery! Love everything about it. The leather outer cover and inside velvet material keeps the ipad safe and snug. I like how there is a handle to easily to hold the ipad while in use. The pocket to store cards is a plus.The only con is that it doesn&#x27;t have a stand up support. Otherwise I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Does not fit snug.  i knew it was not a  real LV, but when you want to use the camera you have to remove it from the case because the hole was not cut properly, the same for the turning on your IPAD you have to push it in more, the cut out  was not cut properly.  Kitt</li>
