### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The orange color is especially beautiful!</li>
      <li>But for lipsticks they are great!</li>
      <li>work great for me!&lt;br /&gt;Natural</li>
      <li>Great cheek stains.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a great quality and it gives me a very nice look</li>
      <li>She said it is good quality</li>
      <li>benefit cosmatics are better for healthy flawless skin as i think</li>
      <li>Very very pleased</li>
      <li>also i prefer nyx with nice prices ..</li>
      <li>however,,i loved powder blush more like Fit me from myblen nude one is amazing for my skin ..</li>
      <li>with in a very light bronzy shade....</li>
      <li>This arrived quickly and in good condition.</li>
      <li>wish it were cheaper but love this product.</li>
      <li>love this item :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit more transparent than I had hope, but coverage can be increased by applying it in layers</li>
      <li>I thought it would be more like a benetint bronzer...</li>
      <li>love it</li>
      <li>please!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using benetint for a decade probably, and I love it.</li>
      <li>cha cha is awesome, and similar to the posie tint in consistancy.</li>
      <li>I use it mostly as a blush, and sometimes as a lipstain.</li>
      <li>I love that I was able to get a sampler pack of these products.</li>
      <li>but if you are familiar with Moon Beam...which I also LOVE, then it is more like that</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed, also the trial bottles don&#x27;t have the same applicator as the full size one.</li>
      <li>just more like a shimmery or sparkly khaki or light brown color....</li>
      <li>This is a nice product with pretty colors.</li>
      <li>they are nice lovely....but need to blend quickly and gently ..</li>
      <li>But she likes it, so it was worth it!</li>
      <li>Make sure to apply to your finger first and then your cheek or you will get a brush shaped stain</li>
      <li>It is certainly long-lasting and survived a light meal.</li>
      <li>It is true what they say - it stays on longer and doesn&#x27;t get into facial creases - much better than powder blush.</li>
      <li>Make sure you blend it in quickly or it will set on your skin and you will wear a streak all day long.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I want.</li>
      <li>so i stopped wearing blush but these cheeky liquids actually give a healthy warmth to my face.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite peachy blushes...also has a gold bronze and a lite pink blush.</li>
      <li>I have been wanting to try them all for a long time now, but did not want to shell out all the money for the full size versions.</li>
      <li>my skin is sensitive and i naturally have pink tones in my skin</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s not as Expected&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s too small</li>
    <li> Great cheek stains. Make sure to apply to your finger first and then your cheek or you will get a brush shaped stain</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed, also the trial bottles don&#x27;t have the same applicator as the full size one.</li>
    <li> I bought this just to test it out and I will definitely be purchasing the larger sizes! Very very pleased</li>
    <li> It was reallllllllly small&lt;br /&gt;Its about  a size of my thumb!&lt;br /&gt;It has a great quality and it gives me a very nice look&lt;br /&gt;But i didn&#x27;t know that sample sizw was this small.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite peachy blushes...also has a gold bronze and a lite pink blush. These are liquid. I usually buy from Sephora, but they were sold out. This arrived quickly and in good condition.</li>
    <li> Make sure you blend it in quickly or it will set on your skin and you will wear a streak all day long.</li>
    <li> It is true what they say - it stays on longer and doesn&#x27;t get into facial creases - much better than powder blush.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t ike them as cheek paint... the gold one doesn&#x27;t work at all. But for lipsticks they are great!</li>
    <li> i simply like benefit products. already have lolli tint. I bought this as a sampler before I commit to buying any other color cheek stain. love it</li>
    <li> Purchased as Xmas gift for my daughter and she loves it.  She said it is good quality her only complaint is that is was small...I agree...for the price I paid, when received I too was disappointed with the size.  I was expecting something much larger.  But she likes it, so it was worth it!</li>
    <li> I love that I was able to get a sampler pack of these products. I have been wanting to try them all for a long time now, but did not want to shell out all the money for the full size versions. Keep making samples please!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using benetint for a decade probably, and I love it. I use it mostly as a blush, and sometimes as a lipstain. I like the posie tint alot, because it is not as dark as the benetint ...that is for the lip gloss....I still prefer benetint for the blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cha cha is awesome, and similar to the posie tint in consistancy. It is creamy...not liquidy. ... although I think I would like a non creamy version like benetint as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sun beam I am a bit disappointed with. I thought it would be more like a benetint bronzer...but if you are familiar with Moon Beam...which I also LOVE, then it is more like that with in a very light bronzy shade....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really it does not look bronze...just more like a shimmery or sparkly khaki or light brown color....Oh, and I tried it on my lips....not for lips...got weird and clumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think is lousy as a bronzer..and would make a better highlighter.</li>
    <li> wish it were cheaper but love this product. my skin is sensitive and i naturally have pink tones in my skin so i stopped wearing blush but these cheeky liquids actually give a healthy warmth to my face. it stays all day and does not irritate my skin or lips.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product with pretty colors. I used it on my lips. It&#x27;s a bit more transparent than I had hope, but coverage can be increased by applying it in layers -- I just don&#x27;t have the patience to do so. It is certainly long-lasting and survived a light meal.</li>
    <li> they are nice lovely....but need to blend quickly and gently ..i use the two colors except bronze i dont where i can use it...however,,i loved powder blush more like Fit me from myblen nude one is amazing for my skin ..also i prefer nyx with nice prices ..benefit cosmatics are better for healthy flawless skin as i think</li>
    <li> work great for me!&lt;br /&gt;Natural look! Stay all day!&lt;br /&gt;I love this item :)</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I want. The orange color is especially beautiful!</li>
