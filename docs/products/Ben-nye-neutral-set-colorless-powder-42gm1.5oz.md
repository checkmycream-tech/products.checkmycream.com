<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT !!!other companies offer the same product for a fortune this one is the original ! it doesn&#x27;t matter what kind of skin color you are this is a translucent powder and it gives you a beautiful matt finish and seriously if you have to you could go even 48 hours without refreshing your make up !!!</li>
    <li> Isn&#x27;t too bad, doesn&#x27;t last all day for very oily skin unfortunately .</li>
    <li> I used this for my halloween costume this year. I really have no makeup experience and so cant really compare this to any other product. It worked well after I applied a fake sun burn.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! Been using MAC prep &amp; prime for years and this hands down blows it out of the water!!! A little goes a long way and the shaker will last for MONTHS! Will never us anything else</li>
    <li> Awesome product! First time using setting powder at all. I love it!</li>
    <li> This powder is ok, but I like the Ben Nye in cameo better.  For sone reason this one seemed to settle into fine lines and got a bit cakey. It just doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the pigmented versions.  I also use the banana powder under my eyes and it never creases or makes my dry skin look flaky,  and the cameo doesn&#x27;t either. It&#x27;s only the translucent that I had any issues with. Over all,  though,  I love Ben Nye products!</li>
    <li> The product keeps my face matte so much longer than so many of the other powders I have tried in the past. However, it has not exceeded my expectations, to my slight disappointment.</li>
    <li> LOVE! Sets makeup amazing! Airbrushed finish!</li>
    <li> This powder does not perform as well as the Forever HD powder.</li>
    <li> I  apply it with a damp make sponge to prevent  caking. up over concealer.</li>
    <li> Love it. Would recommend to any MUA&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This product is the best thing since sliced bread. Really helps to set makeup and decrease shine/oil for the day. I am really impressed with this product and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> pretty good product but I do prefer the banana powder to this one although banana powder from Ben Nye is only really for setting concealer  ........ but still a good product for keeping your face matte</li>
    <li> When I purchase this I could find my shade in powder that I originally use. I gave this a try and I don&#x27;t regret it. Wonderful on my dark skin.</li>
    <li> Great item, very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Seriously melts into my skin, making my skin look flawless! I will keep buying</li>
    <li> I love this stuff...my face is really oily so my make up would run but this stuff gave me my life back now I&#x27;m confident n look pretty good with it</li>
    <li> great setting powder! I&#x27;ve used NARS and MAC setting powder, but this is a great inexpensive alternative.</li>
    <li> Way better than any of the high def powders, sets your makeup invisibly, no photo &#x27;ghosting&#x27;.  Always use over my foundation/blush and spray rosewater&amp;water to &#x27;set&#x27;.  Looks natural.</li>
    <li> Best powder ever! I work outside and this stuff is amazing and keeps my face from looking greasy</li>
    <li> I really like this powder. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Awesome ordered it Friday came in Monday! Great product</li>
    <li> I wanted to like it.  After all the reviews, I wanted to give this a try.  First time putting it on was 7:30 AM, goes on clear, didn&#x27;t give a white cast.  It worked like my mineral loose powder, kept me matte til around 12 PM.  Unfortunate, like ELF HD powder, this broke me out, gave me cystic bumps on and near my nose.  I didn&#x27;t change anything in my routine except this, so I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the powder.  But everyone is different, I encourage ladies/gents to give this a try if haven&#x27;t already.</li>
    <li> I Love this powder.  I have very oily skin and I apply once over my foundation in the morning and I may have to apply once thru the day and it lasts all day long.  This is my new beauty favorite!!!</li>
    <li> Small bottle  but a little goes a long way...my makeup lasted ALL day without me reapplying powder to my oily areas!!...NO MORE MAC for me! BTW, I am a black woman and I did not look ashy! It is truly translucent.</li>
    <li> I love this setting powder!  I use a cream foundation and put this over it and don&#x27;t look back all day.  The only downside, but not worth losing a star, is I find the mouth too small to put a brush in.  With that said, it&#x27;s very fine, so I just pour some on to a piece of aluminum foil and swish my brush in that.  I fold my foil up and refill it has necessary.  I have no mess in my bathroom as fine powders tend to fly around!  I&#x27;d recommend this over far more expensive setting powders I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Product Arrived On The Estimated Delivery Date And Was Packed With A Small Bubble Sheet. Was Received Completely Intact And Was True Size (1.5 Oz) Although The Picture Made It Appear As If It Were A Tan Or Nude Setting Powder And I What I Received Was DEFINITELY A Pale , White , Or Ivory Colored Setting Powder. No Big Deal Though, It Sets Anything Without Leaving A White Or Pale Cast.</li>
    <li> This is talc powder.  Buy some OTC for $2 and save your money on this one.  It&#x27;s supposed to be sheer, but it does lighten your face when it&#x27;s applied... so I used less and it doesn&#x27;t cover/highlight/improve my appearance.  By lunch, I was shiny again.  My matte powder I buy OTC keeps me shine free all day ... this Ben Nye did not.  I returned this product.</li>
    <li> Best setting powder EVER! Leaves you flawlessly matte!</li>
    <li> I have VERY oily skin, and I have to use some type of finishing powder over my foundation. This stuff is amazing for that. I think it can be used well for all skin types. It&#x27;s not drying (doesn&#x27;t cause flakiness).  It applies silky smooth.  I bought the Neutral Set, which looks white, but as soon as it&#x27;s on my face, it is colorless. Love it!</li>
    <li> arrived timely, product exactly as described</li>
    <li> The best setting powder I&#x27;ve found.  Period.  You don&#x27;t need a lot, the smallest amount will do and your makeup doesn&#x27;t crease or move all day.</li>
    <li> Depends on the weather. During the summer I had to apply it twice because I sweat a lot in the summer.</li>
    <li> This is a great setting powder. I know there are many out there, and I happened to see this recommended in a youtube video. It goes on nice, works well, and lasts all day. Doesn&#x27;t leave a residue--no shininess, sparkliness, or color. A great setting powder to go over foundation or BB cream.</li>
    <li> Perfect setting powder that keeps oil at bay and never looks cakey. A little goes a long way, and it&#x27;s got a great texture. My go-to setting powder, especially in the Summer.</li>
    <li> This powder is amazing! I&#x27;m an oily makeup face with any other powder, but when I used this one there was no oil for at least 5 hours! Which is great compared to one hour! Will totally repurchase this!!</li>
    <li> Good for oil control! I&#x27;m dark skinned and the product is really colorless!</li>
    <li> This is a great, light weight powder that isn&#x27;t going to build up. I use this all over in combination with banana powder. Ben Nye&#x27;s powders are true to their name.</li>
    <li> Guys, I wouldn&#x27;t order any Ben Nye products from amazon. Ben Nye does NOT authorize the sell of his products on amazon or ebay so there&#x27;s a good chance you are buying fakes.</li>
    <li> great for oily skin and you never have to worry if the powder is too dark or too light. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with product</li>
    <li> Best setting powder I have tried so far. Absolutely love it. Very much recomended!</li>
    <li> Great setting powder. Love it</li>
    <li> I really like my translucent power shaker bottle by ben nye</li>
    <li> Perfect and light setting powder! Keeps me fairly matte and at a great price because this will last me forever.</li>
    <li> Best powder to set your make up with. It&#x27;s light and there truly no color. I am glad i bought two of them.</li>
    <li> To be honest I thought it was gonna actually make my face less oily in summer heat or like keep my makeup from getting messed up but no it left my face oily as other stuff I&#x27;ve used not recommend but everyone&#x27;s different yep.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had been Ben Nye Powder before in my stage make-up kit. That&#x27;s right folks, Theater Kid in the house. Even though my kit was to match my skin tone the setting power was white, so I kept going with that. I did see there was powders in different shades but for now I will stick with what I know.  It blends in and don&#x27;t cause any white or ashen overtones. I like it and will continue you to use. I have yet to find a foundation or setting powder that didn&#x27;t leave a little chance of make-up on the collar. This setting powder greatly reduces the risk.</li>
    <li> Sets my concealer all day, and I use a cheap foundation and concealer.</li>
    <li> I do NOT like this powder at all. It tends to make my face look ashy after I apply. Even though it&#x27;s supposed to be translucent.  I will just continue to use my MUFE setting powder. I honestly wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone with dark colored skin!!</li>
    <li> Great for the highlight areas of your face. Don&#x27;t settle into your fine lines. I love it. I would definitely recommend this to my friends</li>
    <li> Not a fan, first i dont know if this is a dupe item. I dont like the top i have to end up putting it in a bowl to get on my brush. I know its translucent but i have to put like  coats just to even feel like theres anything on my face. not a fan which makes me sad cause the yellow color is too much for my skin. maybe ill try another color i dunno this one not for me</li>
    <li> My experience has been wonderful. It gives a nice matte finish over any skin color. I have medium/dark skin and I use this powder with no issues whatsoever. This needs to be applied lightly and brushed in to the skin. I use a fan brush or kabuki just because they are the softest brushes I have.</li>
    <li> Love this setting powder but not the packaging so much</li>
    <li> excellent prouct as described and great price and shipping I was referred to use this product by a makeup artist and it works</li>
    <li> This powder is awesome! It highlights my undereye perfectly. I got the translucent color for the winter and it definetly goes with my skin tone. No white cast.</li>
    <li> Amazing love how to settles my make up while not giving a color at the same time totally love it worth the price</li>
    <li> Best setting powder I&#x27;ve tried in a while. I don&#x27;t like the container it comes in, so I recycled an NYC powder container and use that instead. There&#x27;s so much powder in this container, it completely filled up the NYC one, and I still have almost half of this one to use. The powder itself goes a long way, and lasts a long time compared to other powders I&#x27;ve tried. May not be great if you&#x27;ll be sweating a lot, but If you&#x27;re using it for a typical work day, your makeup will stay from morning until long after you get home.</li>
    <li> first off, I&#x27;d like to compliment the service because I had my package delivered to the wrong house by the mistake of the postman and requested a new one to be sent. No questions asked they offered to send me one I was so surprised. As for the product, I love it it lasts all day and leaves no smell or color</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing sets makeup all day great for my kit and shipped out really fast</li>
    <li> The best setting powder hands down!</li>
    <li> Works great and my makeup seems to last a lot longer now.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin so flawless .. And price  u can&#x27;t beat</li>
    <li> How do I open it? I screwed off the cap and the holes aren&#x27;t open and can&#x27;t poar anything out.  They are covered by another hard plastic cap thing I can&#x27;t pop off. Do I pop them out with a needle or something?</li>
    <li> I will be honest at first I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with this product. So I decided to use it as &amp;#34;work makeup&amp;#34; which I really don&#x27;t go all out for because after a few hours of dental assisting and pulling masks on and off my face nothing has staying power. However this powder has changed that! Better than high end or low end setting powders it really does provide the staying power I have been on an a never ending search for! Highly recommend to purchase for those who like have their makeup stay in place for a full day everyday!</li>
    <li> You have to use a needle to poke holes in the cover. It works well then.</li>
    <li> Amazing product ! Leaves a flawless finish, I&#x27;m in love. The shipping was right in time as well . Over all extremely satisfied . Will repurchase for sure</li>
    <li> Very nice thank you to upscale deal</li>
    <li> All of Ben Nye&#x27;s products are great.  I have nothing bad to say about them.  Long lasting.  Helps A LOT for oily skin.  Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Nice and light, smooth feeling, slightly lightens my foundation which is perfect because it matches my skin tone now. Had it for a few months now, barely used any of it and I wear full make-up 5/7 days a week.</li>
    <li> I received it quickly and it was packaged nicely. This is a great powder for a nice matte finish. It can be used on any skin tone!  I would recommend this product and seller.</li>
    <li> Purchased to replace my Makeup Forever HD powder and works just as well.</li>
    <li> I have had previous Ben Nye Translucent powders before but this is not Ben Nye. The consistency of it is off and this ben nye causes serious irritation.. you are better off buying from an official cosmetics store.</li>
    <li> A good seal for clown makeup</li>
    <li> Amazing! No breakouts, no touch ups, no cakey makeup.  I finally found a product that seals in place my makeup and balances my super oily/combo skin.  I use it everyday to seal my foundation and it works great.  It works with BB creams too.</li>
    <li> Excellent product worth the experience</li>
    <li> My order says it is a 1.75 oz bottle but the one that i received in the mail says 1.5 and the bottle doesn&#x27;t look like the one in the picture. I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but i have a feeling it&#x27;s not the real thing.  I even googled it and the lettering and color of the blue do not match mine. I think i need my money back</li>
    <li> I got this because it was supposed to eliminate shine but I&#x27;ve seen no difference. My face is still an oil slick after a couple hours of putting it on.</li>
    <li> I really couldn&#x27;t tell what this product did. I am not happy with it and would not recommend it. Maybe I should have chosen one with a touch of color. It arrived quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Works very well, will buy again</li>
    <li> Its a white powder leaves me looking a lil white and im a light med skinned toned.. wish i would&#x27;ve just ordered the banana color one! ive only used once (small amount) a little bit goes a long way its a good thing; but wrong color for me wish i would&#x27;ve exchanged it for different one because its going to sit in my makeup drawer for a long time!</li>
    <li> The hype is true on this Ben Nye Translucent Powder!</li>
    <li> Love this as my setting powder</li>
    <li> What I liked about this translucent powder the most is that it&#x27;s providing me coverage but all while using my own skin tones. My skin didn&#x27;t appear blotchy at the end of the day, but it did look a bit oily. I have combination skin with most of my facial oils appearing in my T areas (chin, nose, area between the eyebrows). I applied the powder at 6:00 am and by 2:45pm I noticed that my skin was oily. However, it may just possibly be that I need to apply a heavier coat of powder than what I used. I gave it 5 stars though, bc like I said before, I really like that it used my own skin tone.</li>
