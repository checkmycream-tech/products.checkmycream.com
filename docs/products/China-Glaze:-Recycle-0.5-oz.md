<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit old to be wearing gray polish but this is really pretty! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> We love this versatile color.  It did get pretty gunked up after a while, but for the price, we got our enjoyment out of it.</li>
    <li> The color is a tad bit lighter then pictured, but still great color. Only thing I was unhappy about was the polish was pretty watery, i do ombre nail art. The polish was so watery that when I applied it to the sponge, most of the color was soaked up. I got a few other colors of the china glaze and got the same results.</li>
    <li> Looks like metal tips on my fingers. Also comes off easily, which is great is you like to change from one gray to another like I do. A little obsessed with gray.</li>
    <li> Ever since I found this brand I only buy nail polish from them. They have every possible color you could want and the quality is excellent. I rarely go to the nail salon but when I do, I bring my own China Glaze nail polish with me. The delivery estimate  always seems long but they wind up arriving way sooner than expected. And the packaging is small enough to fit in the mailbox. I would highly recommend this color and this brand. Check out Lemon Fizz, Bahamian Blue and Italian Red-some of my other favorite colors from them.</li>
    <li> It is my first China Glaze brand nail polish and it is very nice. I am a hardcore fan of gray nail polishes and this has a nice rich gray, just the way I like. But, the quality and the color are almost exactly same as PURE ICE brand #541CP from Wal-mart, for the same price before the shipping. So, I would suggest you try PURE ICE to save $ on shipping. :)</li>
    <li> The China Glaze formula is always wonderful and this polish is no exception. The color is great - just a very basic lightish grey creme. I love this polish!</li>
    <li> this is my favorite color i love it it looks so awesome and a very in color you wont be sorry purchasing it .....:) awesome really</li>
    <li> A little less shiny than expected. It was used for auto restoration purposes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a perfect shade of grey to wear. I love this one! It goes on smooth &amp; last long too without chipping!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful grey, and the China Glaze formula is top notch, as always.  I love grey because you can wear it with so many things, but it&#x27;s not as drastic as black nail polish.  Made in the USA!</li>
    <li> I truly love this nail polish, it&#x27;s a great color and I&#x27;ve shared it with alot of people.  Will continue to purchase</li>
    <li> i love this nail polish. its the perfect grey. great for the fall and winter :)</li>
    <li> I ordered a nail polish in early February. The tracking number had stated it was mailed from CA but always showed invalid so there were never any updates. Fast forward three weeks, and I still did not have the item. I emailed the company and they said they would send another. I waited over another week and still received nothing. It does not take a month to receive a nail polish in the mail from CA to another state. I am disappointed with not receiving the item and also them not providing a valid tracking number. The only \\&quot;good\\&quot; thing is that they refunded my money promptly. Wow. But it would be nice if they would provide their end of the service...the item!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find the grey shade I wanted. Then I found this color and Amazon had it for the cheapest price.</li>
    <li> I got the color For Audrey, you know, that lovely Tiffany Box Blue, and I&#x27;ve already used a healthy amount of it! I love it so much, it&#x27;s such a pretty color. I know I&#x27;ll buy from these people again.</li>
    <li> Only requires 2 layers for optimal pigmentation and applies quite smoothly. Would look amazing with a crackle polish or mattifying topcoat.</li>
    <li> Overall this is a great product and am happy with it&#x27;s performance. I would purchase this again and enjoy having it as part of my polishes.                                                      Pros:   The color is unique and looks amazing. It&#x27;s the type of color that looks good with any skin tone. Beautiful!     Cons:  The first coat is pretty much useless. You barely get any color on your nails so you have to put a few layers on but once you do, get ready to be wowed!  I don&#x27;t purchase my nail polish from this website but the product itself is amazing!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant at first to buy this color but I have to say that this is definitely my favorite! This is one of the only nail polishes that goes on smooth and evenly and lasts forever.  The color is amazing, it&#x27;s not shiny and I especially like it because it&#x27;s a better alternative than black, which is too harsh for me.  I will definitely be buying another bottle when I run out!</li>
    <li> Grey is the national color for brain cancer and its victims, just as pink is for breast cancer and teal for ovarian cancer.  Wear this is remembrance of someone you love who has or had brain cancer.  I wear it for my mom who was diagnosed in January and had passed away by the end of February.  It is a deadly cancer and people need to be aware that it doesn&#x27;t always start with a headache.  My mom never had a headache.  I am so happy that China Glaze has come out with this color.  I only discovered it myself after much research. As a special note to the producer of this product, PLEASE promote this as a brain cancer remembrance and donate some of the proceeds to the diagnosis and treatment of this killer. As an aside, this is terrific polish and stays on well.  The first coat may look slightly transparent to you, but keep on going.  It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a neutral grey, it seems to be so on trend. I&#x27;ve had a few china glaze polishes previously, and have been happy. Got this, quickly and not damaged so great sender! Color is perfect after two coats. It for sure needs a good anti chip clear top coat as I did find it chipped fairly easy without. This is a great grey and goes with lots of stuff. Right now I have it on with both ring fingers painted in OPI positively pink, and it looks great! I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments. Great buy!</li>
    <li> It looked kind of watery but once I did my nails it looked great and did a second coat just to make sure it was perfectly done.I did liked the color and price and I do love China Glaze.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty color. It has more of a greenish tint than I expected but it looks great on. A nice addition to any nail polish collection,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been looking for a sweet grey color and this is it! So fresh, and it convinced me to order other china glaze polishes because they just have the best colors.     Loveeeee</li>
    <li> China Glaze Nail Polish is now my one and only brand of polish.  I have tried several colours and even the black managed to go veritably chip-free for over a week.  I am throwing out all my other nail polish and buying China Glaze from now on.</li>
    <li> This color is great!  I love it.  Works well on nails and toes, and is very trendy right now.  Its also a great alternative from the black nails everyone was having if thats too harsh for you.  I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments.  I&#x27;m not even a \\&quot;nail polish\\&quot; person, and yet I can&#x27;t resist putting on another coat immediately after the first chips (takes about a week).  Great product!</li>
    <li> This color looks amazing on my fair skin! It&#x27;s funky enough for the fashionistas out there but subtle enough to wear in the office.    When I ordered it I was wondering if I had made the right choice and I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
    <li> The colours are beatifull and original, but the polish dont last.   it chips on me very badly.   The polish comes out tape-like in big pieces.     Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I only bought this because I could fit one more polish in my order without increasing the shipping, I wanted to try something out of my regular zone of colors and decided to go WAY OUT of my zone.  I love black and gray for clothes and household items and pretty much anything - but never for nails. I certainly never thought either should be worn by anyone over 25, 30 at the most. I am creeping out of my 30&#x27;s soon but figured I could wear it on the weekend, when I&#x27;m home, or give it to my nieces if it looks really bad.  Obviously I had no plans for this to be anything wearable-since I had figured the options for what if I hate it.    I LOVE IT!  First of all, this was my first time ever trying China Glaze polish - bought a few bottles in this order in different colors.  The creme colors like this one are absolutely amazing.  I have used the cheapest $1 bottles of polish, Revlon-drugstore/middle of the road, Zoya, up to OPI&#x27;s DS at $12.50 and was shocked how much better China Glaze (cremes) is better than anything I have ever tried before - EVER. I do my own nails, haven&#x27;t had a professional manicure in 7 years-since the price has skyrocketed where I live, never heard of China Glaze, and for $3.99 was skeptical - but could get so many more colors for my money, so I took the risk. It is the perfect thickness so you can use only 1 or 2 coats, depending on your preference, has a nice size quality brush, dries nicely and quickly, no streaking, no lifting of the color on the second coat (since I never wait until the first coat dries).  When it dries, it is unbelieveably glossy - looks wet for a week.  I was afraid to touch anything for 3 hours-because it looked WET! STUNNING, really stunning. I finally was sure it was dry and realized days later, it really stays looking like the first day.    As for the color, it doesn&#x27;t look like trendy goth or grunge (as they used to call it),old cement or trendy but tacky, or \\&quot;I wish I was in high school\\&quot;.  It could be worn with your most casual clothes-sweats or a beautiful gray suit, or a charcoal silk dress, no matter, it is so beautiful, I really can&#x27;t believe it. I didn&#x27;t use a top coat because it really wasn&#x27;t needed but about four days into the polish, I tried an OPI DS \\&quot;Glitter Bit of Music\\&quot; Top Coat that came with another polish as a bonus item.  You can barely see the glitter at all (which I love) but it gives you a sparkle in the light that you can&#x27;t really tell what it comes from.  The next day, I painted the tips (like french manicure) on two of my nails with Opi Coronation (a mild silver, not bling, just silver) to see what it looked like and it was really pretty.  Two totally different colors, totally different types of polish, but they blended perfectly and you could tell it was a french man. but just barely. Another time I painted it over China Glaze FOR AUDREY (a beautiful Tiffany blue creme) which changed it a little to have a nice gray/blue tint, another beautiful manicure - that lasted a week.    Anyway, the point is, it can be worn in so many ways, and be classy.  I would bet you could use a matte top coat to change it from glossy to matte if you wanted, I also considered something fun would be a pale pink with it as a french manicure - maybe not for me, perhaps a younger person, I&#x27;d have to see it to know if  I could pull it off but a Creamy, pastel pink might be nice. This turned out to be a truly Multi-use polish, that started out as a one-time try it out when I don&#x27;t have to go anywhere.    For those who can only wear certain colors:  My skin tone is medium/slightly tan, medium brown hair, and nails are usually medium to short, always trying to get them to grow long, strong and healthy, with only intermittent luck.  All of my \\&quot;gray\\&quot; manicures were with medium/short nails except the last one over FOR AUDREY, by which time my nails were a solid medium length, close to long.  I don&#x27;t know if the polish kept them healthy enough to grow or not, but they have not broken since Istarted using the polish in this order (which had a couple OPI and a ZOYA).  Keeping them polished at all can be helpful so it may have nothing to do with the China Glaze brand. Because of health reasons, I can&#x27;t keep them polished as much as I would like, but it&#x27;s a goal for the new year!    As for the seller - NailsEtc., they were quick, got the order here by Christmas, even though it wasn&#x27;t likely to get here in time, well packaged, and good prices.  HOWEVER, the shipping is outrageous.  It is better than a number of other nail polish sellers on Amazon (some charge $2-4 per bottle, no matter how many you get) but it&#x27;s not worth the cheap prices if you don&#x27;t get multiple bottles-but not too many.  Only a bottle or two and you pay the same or more for each bottle than a regular price seller - too many bottles and the shipping price jumps WAY up.  I say \\&quot;bottles\\&quot; but it is based on the amount of money you spend, not number of bottles so if you get a few expensive items, it may be a smaller package and weigh less, and technically cost much less to ship, but you actually get charged much more to ship.  BE CAREFUL, and check the shipping prices before clicking to purchase.</li>
    <li> What a nice find! I was finding a lot of dark blue and purples I was putting on looked black from a distance and wanted something dark but not black looking and this is a perfect color</li>
    <li> I like it because it is neutral but it&#x27;s very industrial looking. After 2 days it started to bum me out because it was so dreary! lol So I use it when it matches outfits but it&#x27;s not a long wearing color because of the dullness.</li>
    <li> This one is so pretty especially when you wear nice jean/skirt/leather/fur outfit. It is a good winter/autumn selection .  Many people asked me what it was and tole me so chic</li>
    <li> Such a beautiful color.</li>
    <li> I looked everywhere to find this color.  I had mixed it from some old stuff I had and loved it, and I was so happy to find that China glaze made a great gray color with no shimmer. Dries fast and stays on for a long time without chipping.</li>
    <li> This nail polish is the only china glaze nail polish I own. And thats a shame. Its wonderful. A little bit runny. Just a teeny bit but it looks soo good!! The gray is a very unique shade and I get a lot of compliments on it. I love this nail polish!!</li>
    <li> China Glaze Ecollection Recycle is a great, no frills grey. It doesn&#x27;t have any sparkles or anything like that. It goes on smooth and lasted a week with just a little bit of tip wear. I would recommend it if you need a great grey for your polish collection!</li>
    <li> Have not used this yet but its a beautiful color that is true to that of the photograph.</li>
    <li> LOVE It!!! LOVE It. Works great on The nails leves it perfect that&#x27;s why I love china glaze :)) (((:</li>
    <li> This is the best grey nail polish there is, hands down.  I went to different drug store chains and different beauty supply stores, but the only color I could ever find was either metallic (silver) or too translucent.  This is a grey matte nail polish and it rocks!!  It stays about a week with topcoat over it.  I wear it all the time now.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Color is okay, I actually received several compliments on it, but it chipped after a day or so. I have other colors from China Glaze, they are very lasting.</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;ve bought at least 10 bottles of \\&quot;gray\\&quot; nail polish so far, and until I found this, they were all silvery, and shimmery, or glittery.  I&#x27;ve had a very long search for a good gray nail polish.  And in this, I found it.  Thank god.  I can stop wasting my money. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> the first time I put this on, chips and looks terrible.  I would not recommend this product to any one</li>
    <li> I have well over 50 nail polish colors, but as soon as I tried this one, it became my favorite. It has a nice finish, but I always use top coat anyway. It lasted 5 days, which I expect from China Glaze. I don&#x27;t want to take it off!</li>
    <li> This arrived broken and when i reported it to the seller they immediately  sent out another bottle which arrived even more quickly, so overall, no complaints. And i love the color.</li>
    <li> brand color is awesome this brand dries so fast and the color looks really good. I saw this color on someone&#x27;s nails &amp; it looked nice.</li>
    <li> Great color of grey, a staple for everyone&#x27;s nail collection. I would describe it as a darker version of ChinaGlaze&#x27;s Pelican Gray. No too dark, not too light</li>
    <li> This is the definitive gray color. It is a medium gray and goes on like silk. This color has no shimmer or frost in it. It is a nice flat creme color. The picture is really extremely close.  The gray is absolutely beautiful, don&#x27;t be afraid to take a chance with this new trendy shade. I love glitz so I put one coat of China Glaze shimmery Luxe and Lush over it. WOW!!!! A knock out.  It&#x27;s not too much, just the right amount of bling. Compliments galore. This is my new favorite color from my huge collection of polishes. Enjoy!!!</li>
    <li> I love all china glaze colors. They all have a pop to them. The polish has a shine to it that i love.  I also think if you buy this color you should also get boy toy blue and tree hugger.</li>
    <li> I like this nail polish.  I have never owned a bottle of gray polish before and I&#x27;m happy I purchased this one.  Goes on smooth too.  I needed only two coats to get it gray like it looks in the bottle.</li>
    <li> The color is so gorgeous and it stays on for a long while unlike some other nail colors do not.</li>
    <li> I like this color but it does have a bit of a thick formula. The color also seems to be a bit darker once applied than in the bottle.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a simple, true grey nail polish, and this is it. I like China Glaze nail polish because it&#x27;s relatively inexpensive compared to other nail polishes of comparable quality. It stays on a long time. I would say this color has more of a matte finish than a glossy one.</li>
    <li> Great color, dries easily, pretty nice. It&#x27;s not too dark or too light, and there are no sparkles or anything. Buy it!</li>
    <li> I would give it five stars but it does go on very sheer as do all China Glaze polishes. The perfect color for fall, very pretty. By far the best color of grey I&#x27;ve ever come across.</li>
    <li> This color is amazing! It is a really pretty cool tone grey with a slight taupe undertone. Its not too dark but its still not too light so right in the middle. The brush I will say is extremely thin so it takes a little longer to do a full coat. The reason why it bothers me is because it makes me have to re dip the brush several times and can make it hard to get an even coat. The polish itself is also a little sheer so you will need to do 3 coats for a truly opaque finish. I only use two just for the sake of saving polish but it is streaky so if that bothers you use 3 coats. Overall the color is amazing but for a china glaze polish I expected a more opaque polish. Shipping was also extremely fast. 3 Days max!</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with China Glaze products and I&#x27;m very pleased. Not only is the color as advertised, the quality is top-notch. Count me as a new, satisfied customer. The polish goes on smooth and dries in a reasonable amount of time. Two coats is the perfect amount and go for 3 if you want. I was initially hesitant to try a \\&quot;gray\\&quot; color, but I love it! Usually, I prefer reds, pinks and coral shades for nail polish. This is my new favorite. I think it&#x27;s too dark for toe nail polish, at least on my toes, anyway.</li>
    <li> I love grays and I think this one is great for fall.  It is a basic gray with no glitter or shimmer.  It doesn&#x27;t have a flat finish, but it very basic.  I will order again.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this nail polish for seriously TWO DAYS and I&#x27;ve already gotten multiple compliments, from friends to complete strangers at a restaurant! It is a fun, different color. I would recommend to anyone! China Glaze polish is really the best.</li>
    <li> I like China Glaze polis as it goes on so nice and smooth and last a long time without chipping.  Every color I&#x27;ve ordered has been great and vibrant, will be ordering even more colors.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect gray color nail polish. It lasts a long time and is a staple for me in the fall/winter. Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I just got this color In the mail about an hour ago and I was so excited to use it......WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! The only good thing is that it dries very quickly &amp; it has no shimmer as well as it does not look clumpy after 2 or 3 coats, but the smell is just horrible and I have applied THREE coats and I can still see through the color and see my nail!!!...I don&#x27;t know why people have said two coats is enough because it&#x27;s totally NOT! I wish I could post a picture of how it looks on the nail! I&#x27;m so sad I waited what I wasted on this, I&#x27;m going to return it because I believe the color was mixed with extra thinning liquid or as if was an imitation like what is done with many perfumes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not ordered a polish by China Glaze that I haven&#x27;t loved. They work great and look great. I get a ton of compliments when use their polish.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a gray nail polish everywhere! and this was the only place that I found one. I absolutely love this color &amp; would highly recommend it !</li>
    <li> Goes on well and love how they packaged it in bubble wrap. Very please.</li>
    <li> this color is amazing- it&#x27;s this medium grey, which is extremely hard to find nowadays without some hint of metallic tones. the only downside is that you&#x27;ll go through the bottle quickly, since the color is barely opaque and it takes at least 3 coats to get a decent color. i&#x27;d invest in some good topcoat so it&#x27;ll last longer.</li>
    <li> I was initially afraid to try this color because I was afraid it would look too dark or heavy, but this far exceeded my expectations. Even after two coats, the opaque gray color remained light and glossy--very cool and classy. The consistency was somewhat on the thicker side, but smooth and covers evenly with careful application. Just be sure to let dry completely between coats. Overall, very satisfied with this item - will definitely wear again and again.</li>
    <li> Just like any other nail polish. I love the color though.</li>
    <li> I wear this color more than any other I have. I love it, and get tons of compliments literally  every time I wear it! I&#x27;m a cosmetologist, and unless I want haircolor stained nails, I keep them painted.  Highly recommended! I didn&#x27;t buy it here but I don&#x27;t think that matters.</li>
    <li> Lasted around a week and a half to two weeks, much longer than expected. Super beautiful color. Went on well. Super shiny. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I like the color. There is nothing special about it. Just a pretty creme grey. Goes on really easy and only takes 2 coats, if that.</li>
    <li> First things first - I LOVE this color.  I&#x27;ve used it several times in salons and it&#x27;s so lovely.  Unfortunately, the bottle I received was cut with way too much acetone making it super thin.  Normally, two coats of this gives you a gorgeous concrete grey color.  With the dilution, I need four coats to achieve that beautiful color I&#x27;ve come to expect.  We all know a drop or two of acetone will help thin out dried out/cakey polish but the seller must be re-bottling to spread out.  Whatever, still works with double the product but I&#x27;ll definitely opt to spend more on the real product next time.</li>
    <li> This was well worth the money spent.  China Glaze - Recycle is the perfect grey coverage for nail polish.  I have finally found my grey !!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great color! It actually looks exactly as the picture shows. I usually just wear pinks/reds so this is a nice change! I love it!</li>
    <li> Even better than the picture. I didn&#x27;t expect much and thought the color was going to be watery, but with 2 coats it looks great. I love it! Great price too</li>
    <li> Love black nails but wanted to try something a little different. This shade is perfect!! Looks great with 2 coats. Super shiny with a nice top coat. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with chipping. A good top coat makes all the difference.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this color! It is actually pretty hard to find. It was a good price and shipped fast. It is also a LOT prettier in person than in then pictures :)</li>
    <li> Love this color and love the polish!</li>
    <li> Gray is one of my favorite nail colors to wear. This shade looks rad. China Glaze makes great products. I would love to get other colors by this brand.</li>
    <li> Great price, great arrival time, &amp; great product! I would highly recommend this product &amp; the company that sells it!</li>
    <li> China Glaze is a great product and the color is exactly as shown. No surprises and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Love the color, how long it lasts...2 coats is all you need wear it along with a top coat and it lasts up to 5 days for me...</li>
    <li> This polish literally chipped instantly and I even had it done by a professional. I rather spend a little more money on better quality polish. I&#x27;ll stick with Essie brand polish from now on.</li>
    <li> I loove the color. I got the item on time, actually earlier than I expected. Cheap price. It&#x27;s perfect actually!</li>
    <li> Great polish/color! My forever nail color &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> When i receive the nail polsh wasn&#x60;t too crazy about it... but that is my personal opinion hope others will like it</li>
    <li> I love this color! It is so perfect for all season. Perfect shade of gray! I am ordering more for my sister and cousin.</li>
    <li> The color is amazing. It is super shiny and last a long time doesn&#x27;t chip easily and my nails are now super strong.</li>
    <li> The color was perfect. Lasted about 3 weeks with no top coat and minimal to know chipping. Will surely buy again!</li>
    <li> Great Color! Perfect gray actually, not shimmery at all. Flat gray with a glassy shine. The color is a bit darker than the picture, but that was OK with me. Great , hot gray color, looks so good on!</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this color.  It looks very pretty, I applied 3 coats in order to get the maximum color.  Product went on smoothly and lasted a week or so without chipping.</li>
    <li> the color is nice but it ships very quickly maybe with a good topcoat it will work better&lt;br /&gt;. .</li>
    <li> Too light, even after 3 coats. I wish it was a bit darker</li>
    <li> Great color and last a while.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom she loves gray,,,,,,,,stocking stuffer</li>
    <li> The color is beautiful shade of gray. Everyone complemented me on my nails. It applies smoothly and easily. Love the way it looks.</li>
    <li> China Glaze never disappoints. Love this shade.</li>
    <li> Cheap brand but very good quality and beautiful color.</li>
    <li> Poor quality nail polish. Very sticky and applies streaky. Does not dry in a reasonable amount of time and chips in less than a day. Will never purchase again or recommend to others.</li>
    <li> 。☆。。☆ 。&lt;br /&gt;★。＼\｜/／。★&lt;br /&gt;  I used this for my nail Spa. customers Love this so much!!!&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying more next time.&lt;br /&gt;★。／/｜\＼。★&lt;br /&gt;。☆。。☆</li>
    <li> Love the color and consistency.</li>
    <li> It looks great on any skin tone. I think such a wonderful neutral color for the Fall and Winter season.</li>
    <li> VERY IN COLOR.  LASTED LONGER THAN I EXPECTED IT TO.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO SOMEONE.  GOOD PRICE ALSO.</li>
    <li> I really loved this color , I found it to be very light and as descriped. It also didn&#x27;t take a long time to dry..</li>
    <li> Loved the color! It just chipped to easily!</li>
    <li> Great color and does not chip easily.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe why people liked it. I used base and top coat on this polish, but it chipped after a day!</li>
    <li> I looked everywhere for this color! I had no idea it would be so hard to find a medium, MATTE grey polish. This one is perfect. I love it!</li>
    <li> It was very strange... I got this out of my mailbox yesterday afternoon and it probably was outside for maybe 5 or 6 hours before I got home from work. Of course it was cold. I opened the product and I was SO disappointed. It looked much more taupe/brown than the dark grey I was hoping for (and various swatches showed.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I set it aside on my night stand and didn&#x27;t think about it. Then this morning I looked at it again and it was inexplicably grey. I don&#x27;t think my eyes were deceiving me. There was a noticeable change! I wonder if cold does change the color slightly? I also bought For Audrey and it seemed to me like its color changed slightly as well from a greener blue when it was cold to a truer Tiffany blue when it warmed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO strange. Maybe I AM nuts.</li>
    <li> I like China Glaze polishes.  They formula and consistency is good, and the dry time is quicker than many polishes.  This color is a deep grey, almost like dark granite.  It is exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> i own at least 15 china glaze polishes colors are vibrant staying power is great and as far as this color love it!!</li>
