      <li>But for me, it&#x27;s got rid of even more grey than the Brahmi on its own.)  </li>
      <li>Banyan Botanicals Pitta Massage Oil with several good shakes of paprika</li>
      <li>I tried coconut water for mixing it, and coconut oil, the product is very &amp;#34;sandy&amp;#34; like nothing will improve the cohesiveness to be able to spread this on your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>no matter how good my hair&#x27;s been, by next day all is shot.  </li>
      <li>I have nothing to say anything better than this items works really well and delivers the results.</li>
      <li>Will really see how it works after more usage.</li>
      <li>- it&#x27;s not going to do anything!&amp;#34; My hair has never looked so dark and beautiful without a bunch of oil since maybe the day I was born</li>
      <li>(good excuse to buy lots of food while you&#x27;re there).  </li>
      <li>This does seem to make you hair dry, so I mix it the Alma power and EVOO, with a bit of coconut milk seems to do the job pretty good</li>
      <li>, lustrous shine really truly am not saying that to sound like an advert, so much easier to style, kept shape, silver threads among the brown vanished.  </li>
      <li>I used cheap suave coconut conditioner for $1.00) and you immediately feel how soft and manageable it makes your hair!</li>
      <li>This is like my first review EVER.</li>
      <li>/&gt;What&#x27;s even better, if possible, is the way it makes your hair and scalp feel.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this product.  </li>
      <li>so i will see if i love it later</li>
      <li>I have 4 c hair and felt a difference with the first use.  </li>
      <li>I decided to use it in my hot oil treatment.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been able to make some sense of this odd little concoction; I really do think it&#x27;s worth trying if you want healthy, stunning, rapid hair growth.  </li>

      <li>Be sure to keep it on the dry and pasty side.  </li>
      <li>Hesh Pharma Amla Hair Powder 3.5oz powder]], hot water, a tiny bit of conditioner, and oil mixture, and let it sit for an hour (in a homemade double broiler to keep warm) before applying to my hair for an hour.  </li>
      <li>Honestly do not know how to describe how much better my hair looks ... huge volume and bounce</li>
      <li>Plus the Brahmi really darkens your hair over time.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Give my hair the shine it needs! My hair feels stronger less shedding and no more split ends!!</li>
    <li> Not for me made my hair dryyyyyyyyy......to harsh for my type of hair it started to make my hair shed won&#x27;t be buying this again!</li>
    <li> I love this powder I use brahmi with the amla powder. I have natural afro. texture hair, I stop eating meat about 7 months ago and my hair is not as strong as it use to be, once I combined the brahmi and amla powder my hair has thickened and my growth has triple.</li>
    <li> Have INTENTION TREMOR.Since I have been using just about 1/8 tsp a day, the tremor has mitigated almost to where it is unnoticeable</li>
    <li> Brahmi oil use it alternating in the week several hours before washing and twice a week using Brahmi powder, my hair is easy to comb and tangle almost part and leaves almost nothing much less. clear that I recommend.</li>
    <li> I use this in combo with other powders to make a hair rinse to condition my hair and strengthen it. I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I fail to know the point of this product. It was mixed in with other ingredients as a shampoo replacement. The entire thing has been a total bust.</li>
    <li> I add Amla and Brahmi powder to the coconut oil for deep conditioning and they work great for me. Especially after hennaing my hair feels very dry, and they help restore the moisture and softness of my hair. It is a bit messy and I had stopped this routine for a while. But this winter my hair gets really dry, dull and fuzzy and I resume it and immediately my hair gets much better, becoming smoothy, softer and shiny. I will not move away from it from now on.</li>
    <li> I love it! Ok, when I tried it - I was like &amp;#34;this is like dirt in my hair - it&#x27;s not going to do anything!&amp;#34; My hair has never looked so dark and beautiful without a bunch of oil since maybe the day I was born lol. Not to my memory at least. I suffer from dry hair but I guess that&#x27;s not a problem now!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this product.  I mixed it with the Amla powder I purchased and it was great.  After applying and rinsing the product, my hair instantly felt stronger and over time began to even look richer in color.  I recommend the product and will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> the product is very hard to manage, hard to spread on your scalp, very hard to keep it on your scalp, I tried all kinds of things to improve the experience with this, but to no avail. I tried coconut water for mixing it, and coconut oil, the product is very &amp;#34;sandy&amp;#34; like nothing will improve the cohesiveness to be able to spread this on your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I will NOT buy this again.</li>
    <li> great quality, fast shipping. This powder is authentic. works well I am very happy with my purchase. Great for hair and scalp</li>
    <li> Good stuff !!!! My hair darken and feels great after appliction. I am still using this product and will give another testimony after using for a month.</li>
    <li> My order arrived in a timely manner. I just feel any benefit from using it.&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed that it was messy and died my tub, but didn&#x27;t seem to work for&lt;br /&gt;me anyway.</li>
    <li> I do like this powder.  It does appear to strengthen the hair even after one use.  However, I conditioned my hair with oil prior to applying because I did note that some individuals complained about this products drying out your hair.  I also shampooed my hair afterwards rather than just rinsing it out.  Will really see how it works after more usage.</li>
    <li> We have been using for our hair care. I have nothing to say anything better than this items works really well and delivers the results.</li>
    <li> I used it a lot when first natural with amla.</li>
    <li> This Indian product is just amazing! I am using once per week and I can see the difference in my hair...my hair is thick, strong and the gray hair don&#x27;t appear anymore.</li>
    <li> This is like my first review EVER. After reading all the reviews on this product I decided to give it a chance and I&#x27;m glad I did. I have natural hair and since using it it has made my hair stronger and softer. I mix it with my oils, conditioner and in my shea butter/coconut oil mix. I loved it so much I shared with my family and co workers. When this runs out I will surely by more! Only down fall is that its a powder and it gets every where but I just will be more careful ;)</li>
    <li> prompt delivery. I apply it with shikakai and amla and works great. If you want to color your hair then may be have to look for another variety of mehndi</li>
    <li> I have used for 3 weeks and can see and feel a difference in my hair.  It is not so dry and brittle an hopefully this will promote growth.  Time will tell.  I have 4 c hair and felt a difference with the first use.  I also add Amla oil to the mixture for added conditioning.</li>
    <li> I use a combination of Amla, Shikakai and Brahmi with some Amla oil and it works well for me - I can start feeling the difference in terms of texture and hair fall.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great substitute for a shampoo. I use it every two weeks with coconut milk powder. I leave it on for about an hour and followed by deep conditioner. My hair feels thicker and healthier.</li>
    <li> Excellent fit except for socks which don&#x27;t hug ankles. I use seasonal as decorative display during baseball season also fourth of July</li>
    <li> I continue to purchase this product.  My hair seems more dense and less breakage experienced.  I find this an excellent choice for both shampoo (cleanser for the hair and scalp), and a conditioner.  I will continue to use this product.  The service of this seller is excellent as well.</li>
    <li> Brahmi is known to strengthen hair roots. It is good to for stopping hair from falling out. It also help your hair retain its darknessl.</li>
    <li> Compared to my henna powder this brahmi powder is much harder to rinse out. I decided to use it in my hot oil treatment. I mix 1TBSP with 4 ounces of grapeseed oil. It&#x27;s so much easier to rinse out.</li>
    <li> Love how my hair feels after using the product. However it takes awhile to wash it out. Allow for adequate time as this is not a quick process.</li>
    <li> I use this with an Amla Ayurvedic conditioner I make at home with organic oils and products, and my hair is growing sooooooo fast that I have to take weekly measurements and pictures just to keep track. I did a big chop in January and had normal growth, but once I started using this product just over a month ago I have well over an inch of hair growth. I know! I didn&#x27;t believe it either, but one week it was barely to my collar bone and the next it was just past it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, please get \\&quot;If you love it, it will grow,\\&quot; by Chicoro BEFORE you get Nikki&#x27;s book. I feel she really deals with getting you to a higher mental state--because going natural is a big step for a lot of women, especially considering the fact that black women are the only women on the planet who have to go natural--as opposed to Nikki&#x27;s book that is really geared toward stuff you&#x27;d need to know afterward like products and styles. I mean, Chicoro&#x27;s got a chapter on how to detangle your hair and starts the book by telling us not to give our power away. She&#x27;s like a hair growth guru.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the product, I don&#x27;t mind the smell, it&#x27;s easy to mix and it&#x27;s affordable and it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
    <li> It is so good, my hair is so shiny. It takes time to rinse it out, but it is not really a problem</li>
    <li> Good product and fast shipping. I use it in it my leave in conditioner recipe and my regular conditioner for a little added boost.</li>
    <li> thought i ordered both alma and brahmi together, instead i rcv&#x27;d 2 brahmi, used it yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;1st time user so i will see if i love it later</li>
    <li> Wow....this product is absolutely, well, amazing!!! I mix a quarter size amount of the powder with my conditioner (and keep in mind I used cheap suave coconut conditioner for $1.00) and you immediately feel how soft and manageable it makes your hair! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. My hair was so soft and shiny after using this product. I let the conditioner mix sit on my hair for 1 hr (I was watching So You Think You Can Dance and couldn&#x27;t tear away) even though the box says leave it on for 15 to 20 min. Either way, my hair came out great and I received all kinds of compliments on it the next day. I will be ordering more of this!!!</li>
    <li> Used this for the first time yesterday and am so pleased I&#x27;m a bit frightened.  When something is this good you can&#x27;t help but wonder if you&#x27;re going to be struck by lightning or fall into a volcano or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s $2.99 at the Indian shop down the street (good excuse to buy lots of food while you&#x27;re there).  I literally just poured some into a plastic cup, mixed with hot water, rubbed into hair, and clipped a plastic carrier bag onto the old noggin.  Then I meditated and did some yoga ... ha ha ha no!  I made a cup of tea and watched Basil Brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Left it on for about half an hour I think (one loses track of time when watching Basil).  Honestly do not know how to describe how much better my hair looks ... huge volume and bounce, lustrous shine really truly am not saying that to sound like an advert, so much easier to style, kept shape, silver threads among the brown vanished.  My hair actually looks like I want it to look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s even better, if possible, is the way it makes your hair and scalp feel.  Clean and healthy oh my goodness yes.  Even after sleeping on it.  I have to say it:  my scalp feels radiant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, no matter how good my hair&#x27;s been, by next day all is shot.  Feels mucky, smells mucky, looks a mess.  Actually woke up today with ... wait for it ... clean (clean!), beautiful, shining hair.  Hair that looks and feels marvelous.  Scalp happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I know of so far to be careful about is the amount of hot water you add.  Be sure to keep it on the dry and pasty side.  I got it too runny so a bit of a mess getting it rubbed in, looked like I&#x27;d spilt lentil soup in the sink and bath.  Also began to drip from the carrier bag after a bit, which was when I washed it out.  But very easy to clean up; doesn&#x27;t stain like chemicals.  I like the way it smells too; a nice (almost unnoticeable) tree/plant sort of smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t take as long to rinse/wash out as chemicals (at least in my experience.)  Just run lots of water through your hair and shampoo two or maybe three times depending how much hair you&#x27;ve got.  I used Himalya Volumizing Shampoo for the first two goes, then Tio Nacho for the last one as it&#x27;s very conditioning and from the way my hair was feeling I could&#x27;t tell if it would be dry or not.  It wasn&#x27;t.  It was perfect which is why I&#x27;m frightened.  I didn&#x27;t know it was possible to wake up with clean, beautiful hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking of trying this I can only say:  do so as quickly as possible.  Lots of people using this might actually prevent wars being started, everyone will be so happy about their healthy and beautiful heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep you posted on results of regular use, any tips I may learn, and if a gigantic hailstone drops on me I&#x27;ll be sure to let you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update as of 29 July:  haven&#x27;t fallen into a volcano, still absolutely adore this stuff and have discovered a weird, slightly messy, combination of things that, used as well as ... not instead of .. brahmi, will produce ever more and more glorious hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note this is *not* recommended for anyone with light hair.  I&#x27;m brunette/slightly auburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sounds bats but works and *very* affordable:  in between brahmi uses, i.e. not when brahmi&#x27;s on your hair, rub a small-to-medium amount (few drops in palm of hand repeated a couple of times, maybe more depending on amount of hair) of Clary Sage Essential Oil over hair and into scalp.  Mix Banyan Botanicals Pitta Massage Oil with several good shakes of paprika (my really sloppy method for this is to just pour a small - little goes a long way - bit of the Pitta Oil into my hand, shake paprika over, and mix with finger.  There&#x27;s probably a better way!)  Rub into one section of scalp/hair and repeat, moving round the head till you&#x27;re covered.  Squirt a bit of plain ordinary mustard (I use the cheapest I can find) into palms, and do the same thing of mixing it in to hair/scalp in sections.  Rub everything in really really thoroughly.  If you want to comb it through, do so standing over the bath as little bits of paprika will fall out!  Cover with bath cap or plastic bag.  The longer it&#x27;s left on the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So easy to wash out, ~completely~ demolishes grey (please note that with body chemistry being such an individual thing I can&#x27;t guarantee it&#x27;ll do the same for anyone else, it&#x27;ll also depend on how much grey you have.  But for me, it&#x27;s got rid of even more grey than the Brahmi on its own.)  Adds enormous amounts of wonderfulness to all the wonderful stuff the Brahmi&#x27;s already doing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just more and more hair looking better and better!  The Banyan Botanicals Pitta Massage oil (I&#x27;ll be writing a review for that soon, it&#x27;s so good) is a steal at $21.95 because it lasts forsimplyever and is one of the best things in history.  Must admit I gulped a bit when I ordered it as on my budget that&#x27;s quite dear.  But it takes so little for enormous results, actually works out quite cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope I&#x27;ve been able to make some sense of this odd little concoction; I really do think it&#x27;s worth trying if you want healthy, stunning, rapid hair growth.

    <li> This product works wonders on the hair.  Brahmi is very effective to promote hair growth, strengh and shine. It also seems to help maintain my natural hair color and keep the gray in check. I mix a spoonful of Brahmi powder in my regular shampoo and a spoonful of Shikakai and Amla powder on my regular conditioner.  I use these products once or twice a week when I wash my hair. I will always, always use these hair powders and wish I had found them many, many years ago.</li>
    <li> I have ordered many of these hair treatments and I love all of them. This product gives great conditioning to the hair and it definitely strengthens the hair and you can tell your hair is clean and healthy. Love this product. Will order more. The price is awesome. Great great product; order this product. You will be satisfied guaranteed.</li>
    <li> This does seem to make you hair dry, so I mix it the Alma power and EVOO, with a bit of coconut milk seems to do the job pretty good</li>
    <li> After buying this online, I realized the item can easily be obtained at my nearby Indian grocery store for much less. I use this product for my hair along with Awla, tulsi and neem powder.</li>
    <li> eat real good I use it for my hair and I have good result Thanks</li>
    <li> Wow, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this, but man oh man, best conditioner ever!  I mixed mine with Alma [[ASIN:B005DNUWIY Hesh Pharma Amla Hair Powder 3.5oz powder]], hot water, a tiny bit of conditioner, and oil mixture, and let it sit for an hour (in a homemade double broiler to keep warm) before applying to my hair for an hour.  I use to believe in letting stuff sit in my hair for hours and overnight but that was too much of a time sink.  So I&#x27;ve been seeing what happens if I let stuff sit for an hour max, and guess what, same results, lol.  But this stuff, man oh man, my new go to weekly deep conditioner, my curls popped like never before (I am African American with 3C/4A/4B/4C hair).  I was so shocked what it did to my 4C that never curls just kinks up.  I am excited with continual use my hair will get better and better.  Plus the Brahmi really darkens your hair over time.  I could tell it would because while it doesn&#x27;t stain your hands when applying it, it does leave a tint of somewhat if that makes any sense.  So that being said I might not even have to henna anymore either (which I love to do, but it is way too time consuming).  Yay I will use this forever now.  If only there was a subscribe and save option...  I am all about saving time and being natural at the same time, it&#x27;s possible.  No more nightly leave-in deep treatments for me and a day to dry my hair after the fact.  With my new dryer that btw is so quiet that I can listen to the TV and talk on the phone with,[[ASIN:B005IHE9OS Floor Bonnet Stand Up Hair DRYER Hood Rolling Base Beauty Salon Equipment Wheels]], Let&#x27;s Jam Curling Custard [[ASIN:B007U8PQSQ SoftSheen-Carson Let&#x27;s Jam Custard Flexible Hold Cream Gel (EACH PACKAGE SEALED!!!)]] and my shortened routine, it&#x27;s time to regain my weekends, I am going to get out there and live my life! LOL</li>
    <li> I ordered this causes I saw it on YT  but really not sure what I&#x27;m supposed to do with it. I mixed it with my Amla powder not sure I noticed a difference but I&#x27;ll keep trying.</li>
    <li> I mix this with distilled water and place in my hair as a paste in lieu of shampoo. My hair has grown longer,  thicker and has a darker tent. I will use this forever. I don&#x27;t guarantee this will work for you but it did wonders for me</li>
    <li> My wife uses this product on her feet and likes it alot. only been using it for a few months.</li>
    <li> Love it on my hair makes it stronger and makes a great face mask for acne and discoloration</li>
    <li> it has done nothing for my hair but made it rough. i will not be using this ever again.</li>
    <li> fast delivery and I love the products.</li>
    <li> mix it with hibiscus powder, amla, and some olive or coconut oil and make a mask, use it 20 minutes before shower and then wash it. It makes hair shiny and give volume.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works well with my natural hair...stops breakage</li>
