      <li>Refreshing.  </li>
      <li>Bought this as what looked like the next best option when I could no longer get the lemongrass shampoo from Bain de Terre.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m glad to be able to purchase it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>: I&#x27;ve found this shampoo works a lot better if you rinse and repeat.</li>
      <li>Thankyou Mopproducts.com, and Thankyou, Amazon.com!!:)</li>
      <li>But, to have great long hair, it is definitely a good buy.</li>
      <li>I like Lemongrass... and this shampoo is for fine hair....  love it.</li>
      <li>and they make my hair easy to style.</li>
      <li>This shampoo comes in an easy non-slip squeeze bottle with waterproof labels.</li>
      <li>I love how my hair is full of body after using it.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of fine hair and it helps control it.</li>
      <li>my hair was fine.</li>
      <li>but I find it does not give my fine hair any body</li>
      <li>SUPER!</li>
      <li>It has quite a light lemony scent that doesn&#x27;t linger in your hair.</li>
      <li>and I was fortunate that you had it</li>
      <li>Took me a very long time to find a natural shampoos with great design, and a pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>best shampoo for fine hair that I&#x27;ve used, leaves my (thick) hair easy to manage.  </li>
      <li>Light clean smell.</li>
      <li>This shampoo has a wonderful clean fragrance and requires very little to give a hair full of lather.</li>
      <li>I had not been able to find this shampoo locally so was thrilled to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Although it&#x27;s not bad on my fine, rather dryish, blonde hair, it&#x27;s just not as good.</li>
      <li>they churn it out by the tanker-truck full and pour it in everything from laundry detergent to the air &amp;#34;fresheners&amp;#34; you see hanging from some taxi rear-view mirrors).</li>
      <li>Love Modern Organic Products shampoo.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair super shiny and full of body.  </li>
      <li>I have thin fine hair and this product is the best shampoo i&#x27;ve found for my type of hair.</li>
      <li>The smell is wonderful and I will definitely purchase it again in the future.</li>
      <li>All natural and organic,leaves my hair clean naturally and smelling so good.</li>
      <li>It works very well on his baby fine hair.  </li>
      <li>This really does give volume to fine hair.</li>
      <li>I do have fine hair so this shampoo provides adequate cleansing for me, but this shampoo probably wouldn&#x27;t be adequate for normal or oily hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little drying since it&#x27;s not sulfate free, but a good quality conditioner takes care of that problem.</li>
      <li>I used to use this a very long time ago and it may be an okay for people who don&#x27;t care if they use chemicals, but if people want an all-natural product, this is not it!.</li>
      <li>Love the clean smell and makes my hair very shiny and not dry looking.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t find this locally and it&#x27;s good for family member with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>so far the most gentle I have found.</li>
      <li>The only shampoo my husband will use for his baby fine hair!  </li>
      <li>Beautiful subtle smell.</li>
      <li>spend good money for subtle perfume, and to my nose, this stuff smells like cheap (&amp;#34;taxi driver&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I find this not only cleans my hair better</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>It leaves the hair soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Rinse out this first treatment from your scalp, then re-shampoo your hair</li>
      <li>There should be a lot more lather the 2nd time around and your hair will feel a lot cleaner once you rinse it out again.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure about the \\&quot;organic\\&quot; part since it does contain Sodium Laureth Sulfate, but it is a pretty good shampoo.</li>
      <li>It only takes a very small amount to get a great lather and, ultimately, clean hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only shampoo my husband likes for his fine hair.</li>
      <li>I have used this product several years and it makes my fine hair feel and look fuller.  </li>
      <li>I have a very oily scalp and I like that this shampoo seems to help minimize that oil build up.</li>
      <li>: I actually really like the packaging of this shampoo.</li>
      <li>and it makes it greasy fast.</li>
      <li>It really does add volume to my hair.</li>
      <li>Very liquid, needs repacking.</li>
      <li>discovered this after moving to new york, and buying a bottle in a nearby boutique--at a much higher price.  </li>
      <li>I love the fresh scent of this shampoo and while it appears to cost a little more than some, it only takes a small amount to really lather up and clean your hair.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
      <li>Just because the FDA does not regulate the use of the word &amp;#34;Organic&amp;#34; in non-food products does not mean that this company should misuse the word.</li>
      <li>Cleans the hair really well, leaves it soft and manageable</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Worst shampoo ever.  It stripped my hair, dried it out and smells like soap, not lemongrass.  Since the label says &amp;#34;MOP,&amp;#34; my nephew mopped my kitchen floor and washed out the mop with this the MOP shampoo.  It does not even make a good shampoo for cotton mops.  Now, I am trying to figure out what to do with the rest of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I have used this product several years and it makes my fine hair feel and look fuller.  Love it and will keep using it.</li>
    <li> Contains SLS, which is best avoided. Sodium Laureth Sulfate is and ingredient derived from ethoxylated lauryl alcohol and used as a surfactant; may be contaminated with potentially toxic manufacturing impurities such as 1,4-dioxane.</li>
    <li> best shampoo for fine hair that I&#x27;ve used, leaves my (thick) hair easy to manage.  I also use their conditioner, together they leave my hair shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> Love Modern Organic Products shampoo. It seems to be getting harder and harder to find. I buy several when I see it. MOP Rocks!</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for years.  I always pruchased it from my hairdresser and when she no longer was able to get the shampoo I was very disappointed.. My hairdresser recommended I&lt;br /&gt;check on Amazon and I was fortunate that you had it and I could purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great for my hair.  It gives it body and a great shine and I can use it everyday.  I highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Not organic. Ingredients feel quite toxic. I used to use this a very long time ago and it may be an okay for people who don&#x27;t care if they use chemicals, but if people want an all-natural product, this is not it!. Some of the ingredients are organic (according to the bottle), but many are not. Just because the FDA does not regulate the use of the word &amp;#34;Organic&amp;#34; in non-food products does not mean that this company should misuse the word.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this locally and it&#x27;s good for family member with sensitive skin. It doesn&#x27;t contain any unidentified fragrance ingredients.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works wonders on my hair!</li>
    <li> This shampoo does wonderful things with my fine hair.  It leaves my hair super shiny and full of body.  I wouldn&#x27;t have expected this because it looks, feels and smells like an average shampoo product, but the final result is what counts.  May very well be the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used for my fine locks.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo specifically because I have very fine hair.  This shampoo does NOT weigh down my hair and it&#x27;s a pleasure to use.</li>
    <li> sure, it&#x27;s a little expensive, but wow, it smells so great, and it lasts forever since a little bit at a time is all you ever need to wash your hair.  i know i&#x27;m crazy about the lemongrass aroma, but man, it&#x27;s such a great feeling to take all that in when you first get up--kind of like aromatherapy in the shower!  discovered this after moving to new york, and buying a bottle in a nearby boutique--at a much higher price.  this is hard to beat!</li>
    <li> Leaves hair feeling dry.</li>
    <li> Discovered this brand when I could no longer buy what I had been using. Cleans the hair really well, leaves it soft and manageable (I have coarse, curly hair).</li>
    <li> Beautiful subtle smell. It does not need a lot for each wash. I have long hair. I always shampoo twice. Each shampooing is about the size of a quarter in my palm. As soon as I put it onto my hair and rub it, bubbles and bubbles come out! I also notice that in the winter time as it is now, it does not dry out my very thin and slightly dry hair. My hair even looks healthy and glossy after the blow-dry. It is a bit pricey. But, to have great long hair, it is definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the \\&quot;organic\\&quot; part since it does contain Sodium Laureth Sulfate, but it is a pretty good shampoo. It has quite a light lemony scent that doesn&#x27;t linger in your hair. In contrast to other reviews, I would say this shampoo has less lather than the average drugstore shampoo and that might be why some people think it makes their hair feel oilier/greasier. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, but the shampoo itself has a drier than average texture that makes it feel more difficult to lather up. I do have fine hair so this shampoo provides adequate cleansing for me, but this shampoo probably wouldn&#x27;t be adequate for normal or oily hair. I did notice a slight volumizing effect as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I wanted to note: I actually really like the packaging of this shampoo. This shampoo comes in an easy non-slip squeeze bottle with waterproof labels. One of my pet peeves is shampoo companies that use difficult to open bottles or use labels that rub off over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: I&#x27;ve found this shampoo works a lot better if you rinse and repeat. Just use a small amount the first time you wash your hair to clean your scalp. There will be next to no lather the first time you shampoo. Rinse out this first treatment from your scalp, then re-shampoo your hair like you normally would. There should be a lot more lather the 2nd time around and your hair will feel a lot cleaner once you rinse it out again. I find this not only cleans my hair better but I use less product with this rinse and repeat method.</li>
    <li> Although I loved the smell, I disliked how this shampoo dried out the ends of my hair. I&#x27;ll try it again after I have my long hair cut and give an update.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  I have thin fine hair and this product is the best shampoo i&#x27;ve found for my type of hair.</li>
    <li> I like Lemongrass... and this shampoo is for fine hair....  love it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shampoo. It works very well on his baby fine hair.  I can&#x27;t buy it in stores so I&#x27;m glad to be able to purchase it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This great for dry/oily hair it makes it soft and silky after second use had hairdresser to recomend mop products and a little goes long way</li>
    <li> I have to agree with others that this shampoo and conditioner combo is very kind to fine hair.  But the fragrance is so strong and has such an insane half-life  (stays on your hands even after you&#x27;ve toweled off, and oozes from your hair forever) that I can&#x27;t bring myself to use the stuff any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spend good money for subtle perfume, and to my nose, this stuff smells like cheap (&amp;#34;taxi driver&amp;#34;) cologne.  Every time I moved my head it left me gasping for a breath of fresh air.  Ignore &amp;#34;Lemongrass&amp;#34; -- this scent is neither citrusy nor green. It&#x27;s acrid, and artificial-musky (you know the smell... they churn it out by the tanker-truck full and pour it in everything from laundry detergent to the air &amp;#34;fresheners&amp;#34; you see hanging from some taxi rear-view mirrors).</li>
    <li> Refreshing.  Light clean smell. Used this many years ago at a friends house, and was happy to see that it was still around.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. One wash does it.</li>
    <li> Love it, used it for years.</li>
    <li> love it, gives my hair great body and fragrance is nice.</li>
    <li> Took me a very long time to find a natural shampoos with great design, and a pleasant scent. I think I&#x27;ve found my regular daily shampoo!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find the MOP shampoo I used to use......this is second best.....but it works.....so far the most gentle I have found.</li>
    <li> Bought this as what looked like the next best option when I could no longer get the lemongrass shampoo from Bain de Terre. Although it&#x27;s not bad on my fine, rather dryish, blonde hair, it&#x27;s just not as good. The shine is less, the body less, the cleaning ability seems the same. So... Meh. I gave it to my balding husband.</li>
    <li> this product helps keep the style of my hair. I have very fine head of hair and wear it layered back on the sides with some layered down the back and flipped up on the bottom.  I love this shampoo to keep me looking good after being out in the winter wind.  a good product for sure</li>
    <li> Okay so when I was in the shower, I my hair started to fall out. I thought it was just a coincidence, but I was wrong. As I was drying my hair, it felt soft, but when I looked at the bathroom walls and floor my hair was everywhere. I decided it was just a fluke, so I retried and the same thing happened. When I went back to my regular shampoo my hair was fine. I am not trying to discourage anyone, but this is what happened to me. As I said, it cleaned well and what was left of my hair was super soft.</li>
    <li> The only shampoo my husband will use for his baby fine hair!  Great stuff!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> in our household, we have varying hair types.  This shampoo has worked for all of us for several years now.  We continue use it daily!</li>
    <li> A great product for my hair which is fine and needs volume.</li>
    <li> I like this product, it cleans well but it dries my hair just a bit. Not enough for me to discontinue use. I have a very oily scalp and I like that this shampoo seems to help minimize that oil build up.</li>
    <li> Really good shampoo. It&#x27;s the only shampoo my husband likes for his fine hair. Wish the stores still sold it.</li>
    <li> MOP Lemongrass Shampoo is an excellent product.  It only takes a very small amount to get a great lather and, ultimately, clean hair.  It&#x27;s fragrant aroma is another plus for this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this shampoo! As another reviewer said- it&#x27;s weird but make sure your hair is very wet or the shampoo doesn&#x27;t spread well (I know that&#x27;s weird but it helps). Leaves my hair very smooth and shiny!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for a few years. Love MOP products! Great ingredients and they make my hair easy to style. This shampoo has a wonderful clean fragrance and requires very little to give a hair full of lather. SUPER!</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle. I have found my new hair product, that I plan on using permanently. I have never used anything quite like this before.I absolutely love this shampoo!! The smell is light and fresh, and it cleans my hair superbly. I don&#x27;t have to wash  my hair as often. And after a while , I noticed that it totally changed the  texture of my hair! It&#x27;s definitely more shiney and healthier! My hair is all the way down to the small of my back, so what I use on it is very important to me. I have gotten a lot of compliments about how shiny my hair is since I started using this shampoo &amp; conditioner!  Thankyou Mopproducts.com, and Thankyou, Amazon.com!!:)</li>
    <li> Great product. I have a lot of fine hair and it helps control it. Arrived on time and as advertised.</li>
    <li> This really does give volume to fine hair. I was glad to find it at Amazon since it&#x27;s hard to get.</li>
    <li> First of all, this shampoo smells incredible and is lightweight so it doesn&#x27;t feel like it is weighing down my hair. The shampoo definitely does the job of a shampoo but I only gave it three stars because I find my hair getting oilier faster compared to when I&#x27;ve used other volumizing/cleansing shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now I will keep using this MOP shampoo until the bottle is empty, because again, it isn&#x27;t the worst shampoo but not the greatest either, I plan on trying out another shampoo next time.</li>
    <li> It leaves the hair soft and smooth.  I have been using the product for awhile now. I definitely would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is very nice shampoo.  A very nice scent and cleans wonderfully in one lather.  I have thin fine hair and it is not heavy and it makes my hair feel thick and full.  Very nice product.</li>
    <li> I love the fresh scent of this shampoo and while it appears to cost a little more than some, it only takes a small amount to really lather up and clean your hair.  This bottle will last a long time! I had not been able to find this shampoo locally so was thrilled to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The smell is pleasant but I find it does not give my fine hair any body and it makes it greasy fast. Will not buy again</li>
    <li> Great product, it leaves my hair smelling and feeling amazing.  It doesn&#x27;t have all of those harmful chemicals in it either. I will order this product again.</li>
    <li> Love the clean smell and makes my hair very shiny and not dry looking.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It really does add volume to my hair. It&#x27;s a little drying since it&#x27;s not sulfate free, but a good quality conditioner takes care of that problem. I can wash my hair a couple times a week without it getting really greasy between washings, which is great.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great! I love how my hair is full of body after using it. The smell is wonderful and I will definitely purchase it again in the future.</li>
    <li> Very liquid, needs repacking.</li>
    <li> This is some of the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. All natural and organic,leaves my hair clean naturally and smelling so good. Depending on how much hair you have this 10oz bottle will last a long time. This is the only shampoo I&#x27;ll use from now on.</li>
