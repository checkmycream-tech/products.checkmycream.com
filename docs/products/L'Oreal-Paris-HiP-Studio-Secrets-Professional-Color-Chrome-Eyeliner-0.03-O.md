      <li>this is for somebody who is not shy of showing some eye makeup !</li>

      <li>it seriously just glides, and its  a bright yet dark silver...</li>
      <li>Really enjoy this product, One of the few silvers that stand out and is not too blue.</li>
      <li>This product, is dry, arrived open, and I would highly suggested it be avoided.  </li>

<li> I have used it 5 - 7 times and it has broke at least 2 times since I started using it.  </li>
<li> Sliver pencil is very hard to find and brightens your eyes</li>
<li> It is so dry it is painful to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
<li> disappointed</li>
<li> and I think this is one of the worst for that it won&#x27;t even stay on for 10 min</li>

    <li> I love the color and I am not sure if I have an &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; pencil - but when I use it, there has been a tendency for the pencil to break.  I have used it 5 - 7 times and it has broke at least 2 times since I started using it.  I love the color, etc - but not sure if I would buy it again. Even at such a fantastic price.</li>
    <li> It makes my eyes look so nice!</li>

    <li> This looks, straight up, like liquid metal on your eyes. Such a cool effect. I adore it. Lasts all day, even only oily lids. I hope it never gets discontinued.</li>
