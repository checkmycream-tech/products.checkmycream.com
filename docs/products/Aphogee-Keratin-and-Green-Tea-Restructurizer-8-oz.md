<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought  a bottle for myself and my daughter, we are extremly happy with it. You apply after you towel dry your hair. This is by far a great product to buy (non greasy)</li>
    <li> I have frizzy thick hair and using this product makes it more manageable. Adds shine and softness.. not oily/heavy.. love it.</li>
    <li> First of all I have relaxed hair that is long but fine and not very thick. I am using this product for almost a month now and though it is a short time I absolutely love it. It smells good and not a lot is necessary to achieve good results. It has the texture of my hair absolutely smooth, it feels great. I use it along with the ahogee leave-in conditioner as well as chi silk infusion.</li>
    <li> Now I usually don&#x27;t review products I try but I had to review this product. At first I was skeptical because I have tried almost all the serums and oils on the market and most say they won&#x27;t weigh down your hair nor make it greasy. I disagree. All these products made my hair stiff and oily so I decided to try something new. I stumbled onto this product while searching for a deep conditioner &amp; after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try. I used this product only one time and was completely satisfied with the results . I applied the product prior to my blow dry &amp; noticed my hair became shinnier and straighter. I then applied the product prior to straightening my hair with a flat iron. I immediately noticed my hair was silky, shinnier, bouncier, &amp; full of body. No product has ever made my hair feel this way. This is a must have product that I will continue to buy. I am mixed with black, native American, &amp; Latina &amp; I Loove this product &amp; so does my hair.</li>
    <li> I normally only use creamy leave-in conditioners.  However I did use this spray in conjunction with a creamy leave in.  This was passed down to me from a friend who no longer uses it.  Well I must say one person&#x27;s trash is another&#x27;s treasure!!! After the first use my hair felt stronger, and definitely had more body, which is very important to me because I have somewhat thin hair (from years of abusing my hair).  Because I have relaxed hair it&#x27;s very important to use protein-based products on a regular basis.  This condition of my hair has continually improved with the use of this spray. So it&#x27;s definitely earned \\&quot;staple status\\&quot;!!</li>
    <li> It made my hair soft and manageable</li>
    <li> Simply put, it&#x27;s one of the best protein treatments. It&#x27;s like family....... I mourn when it&#x27;s finished and rejoice when i get a new one. It really does what it says!</li>
    <li> I recently bought the pantene pro v heat protection spray for curly hair, thinking it would be healthy for my hair because I have used the relaxed and natural in the past, and it would make my hair really soft.  However, after I used it with my flat iron, it made my hair feel dry and my flat iron actually burned my hair WITH the heat protection spray on it, so that was a waste of money.  I started using this before I flat iron my hair, and it actually protects my hair, it hasnt been burned in quite some time since using this.  I also put this on my hair at night before I wrap it and it feels really soft in the morning.  I recommend this as a heat protection spray and also as a leave in conditioner, though I still use my.  Its just if my hair feels dry, Ill reach for this before my leave in conditioner most of the time.  My only gripe is that it doesnt smell too good, but thats ok because I put a bunch of stuff in my hair that does :-)</li>
    <li> when i brought this i was originally looking for something to spay in my hair every day but i decided to get this instead it really doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hair and yes i followed the directions and applied heat to my hair after i washed it but i could live without it. i really dont see what it&#x27;s doing and i&#x27;ve tried it a couple of times...so yeah, but the chi keratin mist does wonders for my hair i love that product but this i wish i could return it but i already used it</li>
    <li> Okay, I always use this stuff right before I blow dry/flat iron my hair and within a minute or so it strengthens my hair enough that I can comb through it while blow drying. I love it, and it smells great. Im going to have to buy another bottle soon, but really you don&#x27;t need to be soaking your damp hair in this stuff. Just section your hair into 4-5 and spritz each section once or twice. Then gently massage it into your hair, and you&#x27;re good to go.     LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Black with relaxed hair,  naturally 4B. I use this after I wash and condition with other Aphogee products. While my hair is still damp I usually spray this in my hair. I believe this is a good product for my hair care regime, because I got my hair trimmed about two months ago and they are still in good shape. I believe this product has helped me avoid getting split ends by strenghtening my strands, which may be in part to its keratin properties. I will continue to use unless I find something better.</li>
    <li> make your own with green tea 8 oz and a tsp of oil in a spray bottle, i have extremely course hair so if it can work for me it can work for ANYONE! but this will work stop breakage, the whole 9 yards!!!!!!! hair groth!</li>
    <li> I was getting a lot of breakage from using the straightening iron and my daughter suggested that I look for a keratin product. I ordered this and the Aphogee shampoo for damaged hair.  The shampoo is just OK (I haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic changes yet), but I&#x27;m not liking the keratin spray at all.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any decrease in hair loss, my hair feels sticky and-when I brush it-it feels like I&#x27;m actually getting MORE breakage!  It&#x27;s only been a week, so I&#x27;ll keep using it for a while longer and see what happens.    UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo, leave-in conditioner, and keratin restructurizer a month now and I&#x27;m still not impressed.  I haven&#x27;t seen any improvment in the condition of my hair - in fact, my hair actually feels more coarse if I don&#x27;t use my Bio-Silk along with the keratin spray.    I&#x27;m not even going to bother using up these products, I&#x27;m going back to my Suave  and Bio-Silk.</li>
    <li> Stops breakage in it&#x27;s tracks, provides my hair with strength and shine, gives salon results...I am African and have bsl hair and with this product I am able to retain my length. For me this is the right amount of protein for my hair...In love with this stuff.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at a nearby beauty supply store and I would definitely recommend it to anyone whose hair is damaged and breaking! After years of relaxing, my hair was a mess and even after I went natural, I was combating breakage for the first two months after cutting off my relaxed ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Realizing I had nothing to loose, I tried this product and noticed the difference the first day! Within three weeks, my breakage had stopped completely!! I will definitely keep this on standby! It&#x27;s getting warm now, but winter will come again and it has never been kind to my hair. Now I have a back-up plan!</li>
    <li> I use a flat iron frequently and this product definitely helps keep my hair from breaking and being damaged. I love in the smell of the green te, it&#x27;s amazing &amp; of course you all know Keratin is &amp;#34;crack&amp;#34; that is great for hair</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine hair and was having a lot of breakage and shedding. I got this product on a chance and used it after washing my hair. I sprayed it on, put setting lotion on top, and wrapped my hair.     The next day when combing out my hair, I was amazed to find that the breakage had completely stopped! I&#x27;m very surprised, and pleased. Nice fragance and easy to use spray bottle. I also use the Aphogee Damage Shampoo and that&#x27;s good too.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my hair right after I put a rhelaxer on my hair and before I plan on curling my hair and it does wonders! It makes my hair hold curls better and also makes my hair shine better! Very good product!</li>
    <li> Product as described.</li>
    <li> I was shopping on Amazon and just happened to come across this product. My hair was in dire need of protein and after relaxing my hair it is very vulnerable. The first time I used this product after washing my hair I noticed an instant change. My hair was soft and stronger. When I used it after my chemical service, there was virtually no breakage like there was before. This product does exactly what it says and that is rare... My hair is thankfully more resilient and is with a healthy level of protein. It also has a wonderful soft fragrance.</li>
    <li> i received this product the other day and tried it and it works wonders i would recommend this to everyone to try</li>
    <li> I have mixed texture hair; very very long, being mostly strait with just enough curl in sporadic places to turn it into a witchy-poo frizz style, when left to it&#x27;s own devices.  Its Dry on the ends, oily at the roots, and down right tempermental with a mind of it&#x27;s own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had much success with brazilian keratin treatments, although the price of getting them is killing my bank account!  Hence, me trying this product,...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I&#x27;ve been using this product religiously for about two weeks, after every shampoo, (every other day)even though the only directions that are near to clearly specified, are to use it \\&quot;after chemical treatments\\&quot;.  It is pretty unclear as to exactly what/when to use it other than that.  So, Because I saw 0% evidence of this even being in my hair(no exaggeration!) after using it conservatively the first time, then I stepped up the spraying, and now use it after shampooing, like a leave-in conditioner. I have even begun to use it like a water spritzer to help tame the funky frizz outbreaks while my hair is air drying...(my hair au natural)  Blow drying, and ironing are no different.  Zero Results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lists water as the first ingredient on the label.  Thats the only honest word on it.  I&#x27;d bet money that there&#x27;s not much else other than water in the bottle.  It has pretty much no smell, no taste (yes, i admit I tasted it, lol) no color, and ultimately has NO EFFECT at all on my hair texture, volume, softness, or shine.  Not even on my skin where it oversprays!!!  It is just an orange H20 spritz bottle.  No more, no less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this, unless you have to throw cash away on a dare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way to waste the money more, would have to be to pay someone $7 to punch you in the lip.  Then atleast I&#x27;d have a plump or \\&quot;volumized\\&quot; lip!!!  With this purchase, I didn&#x27;t even get that,...  Aphogee makes a knuckle sandwich sound great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to use this though, and update accordingly, since I am still holding out for the \\&quot;ahh haa!\\&quot; moment, where I can see some sort of product transformation, or \\&quot;Reconstruction\\&quot; as it describes itself on the label.  I&#x27;m not gonna hold my breath for that though...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now the end of July, and the results are in.  NO CHANGE WHATSOEVER.&lt;br /&gt;This product is worthless, and if you saw any sort of benefit from it, you&#x27;d have seen the same from using a spritzer bottle of water.  Plain water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Useless product!  I&#x27;ve been \\&quot;off\\&quot; of using it for a week or two, and honestly, my hair is EXACTLY as frizzy as it ever was before &amp; during the use, no change.&lt;br /&gt;Save your $ people.  This stuff is worthless.ahh haa!\\&quot; moment, where I can see some sort of product transformation, or \\&quot;Reconstruction\\&quot; as it describes itself on the label.  I&#x27;m not gonna hold my breath for that though...    -------------------------  UPDATE:  It&#x27;s now the end of July, and the results are in.  NO CHANGE WHATSOEVER.

I&#x27;ve been \\&quot;off\\&quot; of using it for a week or two, and honestly, my hair is EXACTLY as frizzy as it ever was before &amp; during the use, no change.  Save your $ people.  This stuff is worthless.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because it was suggested to me. Unfortunately, I saw absolutely no difference in the condition of my relaxed hair after using it. I actually gave it away after two uses to my friend. I&#x27;m not sure if she finished the bottle but I know that she wasn&#x27;t compelled to buy another. If you can try it for free, go for it. I just found that it wasn&#x27;t worth the money I spent on it.</li>
    <li> I am AA and I have Fine hair which started to break off I used this product and it made my hair worst than what is was... I will NOT EVER BUY THIS AGAIN... I will stick with a home remedy of egg yolk, honey, and olive oil prior to shampooing my hair (sulfate free shampoos) it works better.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair (chemically treated) and I noticed absolutely no difference using this. What&#x27;s it supposed to do exactly? I&#x27;ve used protein treatments before (the Babyface Protein) and it was really nice. This Aphogee though, just didn&#x27;t seem to make much difference in the way my hair felt at all. I wanted it too, because the spray-on application is very convenient. Oh well. Maybe just not the right product for me.</li>
    <li> I am transitioning to natural hair, and this produce is really helping to as I say &#x27;heal&#x27; and strengthen my natural new growth, while doing so.</li>
    <li> Just neutral here on this one.  I have used it.  Don&#x27;t know if it works.  Lets just say it didn&#x27;t hurt.  Maybe it&#x27;s good if you know your hair needs it and you use it, but I&#x27;ll skip  on this one next time</li>
    <li> Ok, I sprayed this product on  my hair after deep conditioning. Then I put a setting lotion (lotta body foam wrap), and then roller set my hair with large rollers.  (My hair is relaxed and shoulder length). My hair is came out so dull looking , no shine , it even looks dirty.  I did this on Sunday, and today is Wednesday, so I will be shampooing  my hair tonight to get this keratin &amp; green tea restucturizer out of my hair.  I did put some moisturizing cream &amp; CHI silk infusion on my hair, but still very dry and dirty looking.  This product will be tossed out. Sorry it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> My hair was breaking off drastically. The sink, the comb, the floor would all be full of hair. I recently had a re-touch and thats when the breakage became worst. I probably lost about 1/4 of my hair due to breakage. Well, I was at my sister&#x27;s house and saw the Aphogee Restructurizer in her bathroom. It said \\&quot;stops breakage\\&quot; and thats all I needed to know. After I used it, the very next day the breakage STOPPED. STOPPED, I say! There were a grand total of FOUR hairs in the comb! The next day, the same thing. So I ran as fast as my legs would carry me to my computer and ordered my own. :) ---- My hair has not been breaking off at all. Had I not experienced it myself, I would not have believed it. This is one of the FEW products that does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t really impressed.. Didn&#x27;t really see a difference .. But will continue to use</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this product way more stars! I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but this product helped me a lot and I hope it helps someone else too. I am a black female with relaxed hair just fyi. I bought it at my local sallys and have been using it after washing my hair. I also use it every few days before I wrap my hair at night. Once liberally applied, I moisturize and seal my ends with oil (which ive done before in the past but still had breakage). I have been using this for 2.5 weeks and noticed that my hair is touching my shoulders. It&#x27;s always been close but never made it there. I&#x27;ve never had a product give me such fast results with breakage other than going to a professional stylist. it also makes my hair straighter with my flat iron. I use a heat protectant just in case. I just can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve finally found something that is helping me retain my growth! Im also taking biotin to help with a faster growth that I&#x27;m actually retaining!!</li>
    <li> I recently got a haircut that was... let&#x27;s just say not a textbook perfect cut. I&#x27;ve been working with a very skilled hairdresser to even it out and bland in the \\&quot;chops,\\&quot; but I also have been forced to use a flat iron to direct the hair into what I consider a style that I can live with. The end results have not been great, I can see the fuzzies appearing and I am not happy. ApHogee Keratin and Green Tea Restructurizer was recommended to me. I did the research and gave it a shot. The price is not outrageous, and it seemed to bring an end to the bits of breakage that cause my hair to \\&quot;snap\\&quot; while I&#x27;m styling it. If your hair could use some improvement and you don&#x27;t want to use anything that will add grease to your mane, this product could be for you. ApHogee is a really good line!</li>
    <li> This product did nothing much beneficial effect to my hair except wetting my hair. I only like the fact that the product is in spray form which is convenience. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Great for frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Exact item works good</li>
    <li> this will boost your hair like no other, it will have it looking good right after you flat iron it</li>
    <li> Just love it. Bought the vitamins and some other products from ApHogee. Very satisfied. Just don&#x27;t apply too much otherwise your hair looks greasy.</li>
    <li> I need to wash my hair reaaally bad yesterday so I went on a mini haul at Sallys. I picked this up after reading the reviews and these ladies aren&#x27;t lying this product is the TRUTH! My hair is self- relaxed and I noticed my hair was breaking at the crown and something needed to be done. I washed w/ ORS creamy aloe, deep conditioned w/ ORS nourishing conditioner, applied my infusium 23 and the apoghee green tea. I blow dried my hair but I didn&#x27;t really noticed a difference. . until I flat ironed my hair (I did use a spritz of GVP chi thermal)and my hair is soooooo soft and has so much bounce!! Its never been THIS soft and flowy. I really like this spray. I can&#x27;t wait to see my hair w/ extended use!!!</li>
    <li> Where has this been all my life, gives life to my flat ironed hair loves it will be repurchasing as soon as I have to</li>
    <li> I love this product and it helps but the protein balance in my hair! I use it mostly after I wash my hair!</li>
    <li> If your hair is so damaged you feel the only way for improvement is to cut it off, try this beforehand! My hair was so damaged I&#x27;ve never seen any hair so bad, relaxers and finally a poorly applied texturizer had stripped my hair strands so thin, they all starting snapping off! I&#x27;ve tried expensive conditioners, treatments all to no avail!  I had come to conclusion I should just cut my hair off and perhaps wear a wig so it could grow back healthy.  I hesitated to try this thinking it was the same as every other product, but with so many good reviews I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt.  After one use, my hair was instantly stronger and it filled in and mended and repaired my hair strands.  My hair looks like it did before the damage!  I&#x27;ve used this for 3 weeks and even on my dry hair, it works! You will only regret not buying this!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really know if it works, i haven&#x27;t really been consistently using it.</li>
    <li> On the first day I notice my hair was softer, smells amazing and you get a lot of product. After that I didn&#x27;t notice a different but I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s protecting my hair, since when i straighten steam comes up from the product burning instead of my hair</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It really helps with the frizz . I would recommend it</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length relaxed hair that had begun to shed after the birth of my daughter.  My hairdresser suggested I had the aphogee keratin and green tea restructurizer to my hair care regimen and what a difference this product has made on my hair.  My hair is stronger and the shedding has stopped.  This product is best used on a weekly / biweekly basis depending on your needs.</li>
    <li> Just started using haven&#x27;t seen any results yet</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING! I am African American with natural long hair. This stuff is the real deal. It has reduced my shedding  tremendously and assists in getting my hair BONE straight when I press it. I get the same results I would if I&#x27;d gone to a salon. This product also adds body, shine and has a long term detangling effect (hair doesn&#x27;t get as tangled in your next wash). I feel like it &amp;#34;training&amp;#34; my hair in becoming tamed. Please give this a try.</li>
    <li> This product is great on transitioning, fully natural and I also used it while relaxed. Makes detailing easier to me.</li>
    <li> Seems to work for me!  Can&#x27;t brag too much about it since I am not a hairstylist by profession.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I initially got it at a Sally&#x27;s beauty supply store because I was out of a previous keratin spray product. I bought this and another brand of keratin spray. I have not even touched the other product because I find myself reaching for this every time I get out of the shower. I straighten my hair pretty often and even when I don&#x27;t I live in an area with high humidity that makes my hair frizzy, dry, and causes breaks, so this is a must have! I spritz just a little of this in my hair and blow dry it or let it dry naturally. I also love it because it doesn&#x27;t buildup and cause greasy spots on my scalp if I end up spraying too much. I also love to spray this on my hair after I straighten my hair and it softens the ends!</li>
    <li> Does exactly what is states.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought hundreds of products over the years for my fine/limp/frizzy hair and Aphogee Keratin &amp; Green Tea Restruc. does just what I&#x27;ve been looking for. It has given me amazing results after the first use.  I finally have body and bounce in my hair, unbelievable!...and it&#x27;s so cheap! I just give my hair a few sprays before drying and it feels so much stronger.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works, if you notice that your hair is like straw, and just moisture aint working.You need   protien and this.</li>
    <li> I love Aphogee.  I hate this product.  I&#x27;m black and I have soft hair that has really deep waves.  It doesn&#x27;t like to stay straight and even with relaxers it reverts.  It takes forever to dry and frizzes with the first sign of moisture.  Clearly that means I blow dry and flat iron a lot which means heat damage, and since I use Aphogee treatments and conditioner I tried this.  It makes my hair sticky, dull looking, and fluffy no matter how much I use.  Once it&#x27;s in no amount of oil sheen, hair grease or cream will give it shine,and it stays sticky until I wash it out.  I am now looking for another product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.</li>
    <li> I gave  a 3 star because I am not really sure if this product worked how it&#x27;s supposed to . It felt a little grimy in my hair , I guess it kinda made my hair a little more manageable .</li>
    <li> I love this leave in. I have relaxed hair that used to be very thin and Aphogee has really turned it around.</li>
    <li> I have natural curly hair that loves moisture. I was looking for something that would bring my hair back to life and strengthen it because I was going through a period where my hair was just so dry and I couldn&#x27;t find anything to moisturize it. I use this as a leave and and style my hair as I desire. I have been using this for about a month now and I have notices that my hair is much stronger and looks healthier.</li>
    <li> i dont even know what this does, i bought it hoping it would help keep my hair healthy and cut down on the dryness, over all, it didnt do much for me, invest in something better,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;although my hair style is curly african american hair</li>
    <li> forever my heat protectent spray</li>
    <li> Love how this sprays from the bottle.  Nice coverage and immediate results of hair strengthening and very very very very minimal hair loss.  Probably not even 30 strands.</li>
    <li> ApHogee has the best products. If you have a perm and it&#x27;s over processed, damaged and have split ends..... USE THIS weekly!!!</li>
    <li> very good product love it does what it says i will be telling friend and family about this so they can try it thank you</li>
    <li> Hair necessity! Just love it!!!</li>
    <li> This brand is fantastic! I love all of their products and my hair loves this specially when I blow dry and flat iron!</li>
    <li> I started using this product almost 3 years ago while I was transitioning to natural. I still use this product weekly and I will always use it as long as they keep making it. I have fine 3c/4a hair and my hair needs the extra protein boost to keep it strong. It is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell. I just started using the Aphogee two minute reconstructor as a light protein treatment after heat styling my hair and I like that product too. I also use the aphogee moisturizing shampoo to clarify my hair every 6 weeks. This product line has worked well for me.</li>
    <li> I used this a few times and my hair looked really dirty and greasy afterwards.  I wash my hair every other day, and if I use this, the following day my hair looks so greasy that I have to wash my hair a day early.  Perhaps my hair is just too fine. I prefer the Bumble and Bumble thickening spray; it also has the hydrolized protein in it as well.</li>
    <li> Such a great product I am so glad I bought this for my hair. It really works and does what it says.</li>
    <li> Smells pretty good, but it doesn&#x27;t really seem to be doing much for my hair. My hair is really damaged so maybe thats why.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and WHAT A BIG BIG BIG difference! FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS! JUST DO YOUR RESEARCH! THANK YOU APHOGEE!  Come on what you waiting on! Very GOOD stuff.....</li>
    <li> I have large curls/wavy hair, very fine but a lot of it. After reading a few reviews and seeing the price wasn&#x27;t too crazy I thought I would try it out. It is definitely a good product - adds shine to my hair, more &amp;#34;life&amp;#34;, and even my hair dresser noticed less split ends. I would not say this is a miracle product as some of the reviews seem to indicate, but I would recommend trying it out as it does have good benefits. The keratin is the real secret, it prevents damage/split ends to hair - so any spray that has keratin in it should be beneficial to your hair.</li>
    <li> This product works wonders!, it revitilizes and re builds hair! I used a flat iron to activate the product. It turned my rough,parched and kinky hair into silk! Without any other product used! I highly recomend this wonder! Its magic!! Great seller! Shipped fast! A++</li>
    <li> After shampooing with ApHogee shampoo for damaged hair, I spray with this restructurizer.  It&#x27;s so easy......I no longer need to add the step of conditioning.  My hair is stronger......has some life in it.  These are my two favorite hair products.</li>
    <li> Great for fragile, fine hair.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what the other reviews said it would. My hair looked healthier after just a few uses!!!! Amazing product</li>
    <li> I had no trouble with the sellers.  I needed help with my split ends and used it only a few times.  I still have a lot of split ends.  It&#x27;s in the closet with all the other hair products that don&#x27;t work. :(</li>
    <li> good, nice smell, seems like it works, I use it every few washes and after I get my hair relaxed.</li>
    <li> A must in my haircare regimen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m starting to love Aphogee, Deva Curl and Ouidad for my curly head! Seriously I&#x27;m back to getting my hair healthy. I&#x27;ve done it all to my curls....cut, dyed, bleached, chemical, heat etc almost everything that&#x27;s a big no no. But this product definitely helps restructure your hair! My curls are slowly coming back to life! ( I did cut a lot of my bad damaged hair so don&#x27;t think spraying this product alone going to do anything. I advise doing research, that&#x27;s how I came across this product!)</li>
    <li> I love this product and will be ordering more soon. Noticed a difference in the strength of my hair though I balance it out with moisturizing treatments. The spray is really effective as it is easy to reach difficult areas at the back of my head.</li>
    <li> I like how my hair felt after I used it.</li>
    <li> This product left my hair feeling thicker and smoother. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> This product works well along with the Matrix Biolage Smoothing Shine Milk. You put it on your hair when it&#x27;s damp and it will feel so soft. For curly frizzy hair</li>
    <li> I was natural when I first purchased this product last year, and I hated it. It did nothing for my hair. My hair type is 3b-4a. I was tired of dealing with my natural hair so I relaxed my hair September 9, 2012, and I started using this product in my hair after washes as a leave in and I absolutely love it. It makes my hair so soft and strong. I use this Aphogee Keratin &amp; Green Tea Restructurizer to roller set my hair as well. My hair has never felt better. I had to repurchased another bottle.</li>
    <li> My stylist originally recommended this product.  After trying it from her, I have ordered it from Amazon (better price and no hassle delivery).  I have that crazy, wavy Irish hair so I flat iron a lot.  This is wonderful. Smooth, silky, shiny hair every time. The bonus is humidity control!  I&amp;quot;m in SW Pa, and it is unbelievably hot and humid.  This product has been wonderful for styling in this kind of weather.</li>
    <li> really good for all texture hair!!!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant at first as I prefer creamy leave in conditioners and I&#x27;ve always bought very high end products that just ended up in the garbage.  I was very surprised this worked on first use. I can actually see results after every use.  I bleach my hair regularly, sometimes 2x a month if I&#x27;m unhappy and want more highlights.  my hair has been fried, extremely damaged and breaking off. I saw immediate results. I&#x27;ve also been using their protein treatment and Provitamin leave in conditioner. They all saved me from having to cut my hair off and start all over. My hair dresser asked what I&#x27;ve been using she couldn&#x27;t believe my hair had shine and looked healthy. This stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Con- smell is not good not real bad either but dissipates immediately. I do prefer nice smelling products. But for the results I get with this the smell is not a factor if I&#x27;m trying to save / keep my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought some sort of protein treatment from this company years ago and it made my hair hard. But it&#x27;s been like 20 years! So I thought I&#x27;d give this product a try as I&#x27;m always looking for leave-in keratin based treatments for my hair. This was not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed it in my damp hair, styled as usual (braid-out), and my hair was crunchy for the rest of the week. Can&#x27;t imagine how it acts when you heat style your hair. I definitely do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I only use this after a relaxer or during flat irons. When used with heat, made my hair VERY bouncy, shiny, and strong. I use this in combination with a heat protectant.</li>
    <li> Its a good product to use on damage hair or color hair. And helps strength hair. Adds protein too it.</li>
    <li> Very good keratin treatment, my hair loved this stuff</li>
    <li> I generally dislike doing protein treatments because I&#x27;m protein sensitive (i.e., hair left feeling dry after a protein treatment) and the process is a pain in the butt.  But this handy little spray gives you the same benefits by strengthening your strands with half the effort.  It also doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
    <li> I like it.  Feel like it is adding protein in a gentle way but that&#x27;s not a scientific observation on my part.  I used to use Giovanni Vita-Pro fusion but I imagined it was making my hair softer.  I have fine 4c hair and a lot of it.  It was getting limp so I tried Apogee 2 Step with great results and wanted to see if using this in between could help.  It adds much needed H20 and has vegetable, silk and keratin proteins.  I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for silk protein.  There scent is not strong my opinion.  It&#x27;s a fruity tropical scent but doesn&#x27;t last and/or I&#x27;m using other products with a stronger scent.</li>
    <li> This provides sheen and restruction to my hair. My hair is usually limb and very light weight, but after apply this product i can feel the strength. My hair looks hair and no longer looks dry.</li>
    <li> Great product. Use as a leave and to help style my hair. I will be re-ordering this before i run out.</li>
    <li> This stuff is perfect in my hair. It&#x27;s never hard or crunchy and it restores bounce, shine and ability to retain moisture and style. I love it for damaged hair as well as maintaining healthy hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know that I noticed any difference to my hair with this product.  It&#x27;s super watery.  I wonder WHAT, if anything is exactly in it.  Probably will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t do much of anything for my hair. It helped a bit as a detangler but I didn&#x27;t notice any additional strength or health in my hair. I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> The best stuff I have ever used! This spray literally stops damages INSTANTLY. I had to ask my sister to use it just incase it was a placebo affect situation... She too agrees that this stuff is really a life saver and will be purchasing some of her own. I literally spray this on my hair DAILY - at the roots and my ends (the damaged areas)... I recommend this product HIGHLY! The whole line of products is definitely a must have... African American female with processed damaged hair...</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It madr my hair manageable and soft and shiny. I use it all the time. It isn&#x27;t too heavy on my hair and it truly makes my hair feel healthier. Will be adding this to my list of must haves.</li>
    <li> I am not quite sure what this does but I think it strengthens your hair.  I have been using it for a few weeks and feel it is helping my split ends to heal along with a protein treatment that I do once a month.  it&#x27;s light weight and does not weigh the hair down.  Don&#x27;t spray to much you only needs a light misting.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet...Based on the I instructions I have no need for it as it but I does smell good</li>
    <li> Like the spray, it&#x27;s light, smells good and makes my hair shiny.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I&#x27;m not entirely sure if it is a miracle revitilizer for the hair but it does make my hair soft.</li>
    <li> this product works miracles. it help repair your hair as well as protects it from heat, but be careful because it is a protein treatment to much will break your hair off</li>
    <li> All the aphogee products are amazing my hair is healthy strong and silky I would recommend</li>
    <li> Know what shape your hair is in beforehand. This product made my daughter&#x27;s virgin hair feel like hard and dry straw. I felt like this product was a waste of money. I decided to give it one more try in my transitioning hair, and I received opposite results. This product made my hair feel soft, strong, and moisturized. I would recommend if you have/had a relaxer...but not if you have chemical free hair that doesn&#x27;t need much protein.</li>
</ol>
