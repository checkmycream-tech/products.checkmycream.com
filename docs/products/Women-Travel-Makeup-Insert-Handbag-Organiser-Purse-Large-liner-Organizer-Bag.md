      <li>/&gt;Basically this is a good organizer that can work in lots of places for lots ofpurposes, but you should remember that it isn&#x27;t really meant to be hauled around itself and needs to be placed in another bag if you want it to be portable.</li>
      <li>I just could never find anything easily.  </li>
      <li>If you could see the stuff i carry in my purse, then you would understand why this get a 5 star rating, everything organized and in place, easy to locate, without even looking inside the bag........</li>
      <li>now I can easily move all my stuff from one purse to another with no problems</li>
      <li>and I can get to them easily.</li>
      <li>so easy to switch purses now</li>
      <li>so i can find them easy .</li>
      <li>Now I can easily find all my stuff in my bag.</li>
      <li>Love it, it holds everything and keeps my purse / workbag super organized</li>
      <li>it fit into my bag just the way i wanted it too</li>
      <li>/&gt;Or if you buy this for your child&#x27;s suitcase (it would certainly fit, and</li>
      <li>Those things are huge so this would definitely fit, and it would be perfect for holding pacifiers and such in the pockets and diapers in the main compartment.</li>
      <li>It took up a lot of space in the bag, and didn&#x27;t turn out to be very useful for me.</li>
      <li>I was expecting sth really small but turn out to be a medium size with a loooott of pockets perfect for me.</li>
      <li>Pretty, lightweight, many pockets holding everything I need.</li>
      <li>I guess if I had a smaller purse with a better fit for the organizer, it would work better.</li>
      <li>Well, my mother-in-law gave me the most beautiful big, open bag...</li>
      <li>That being said, for the price I paid, it&#x27;s adequate (just cut a rigid piece of plastic or cardboard and insert it into the zip pockets).</li>
      <li>you can easily access the pockets and the main interior space though.</li>
      <li>If you do that, the main space easily holds a tablet, a wallet, a phone.</li>
      <li>Or you can not put any of those in and fit 3 summer size paperbacks or one harry potter sized book in the main compartment.</li>
      <li>Keeps everything I need daily together and to change a purse or put it into a tote is so easy!</li>
      <li>Keeps my bag tidy enough that I don&#x27;t have to dig around too much.</li>
      <li>When I went shopping for a new bag, I pulled out this organizer to make certain it would fit.</li>
      <li>It looks and feels exactly as it should a lot of pockets.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This could also be an interesting organizer for a junk drawer in a deep kitchen or office drawer.&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s cheap enough you wouldn&#x27;t care if they messed it up pretty quickly)</li>
      <li>This is for large purses.</li>
      <li>Very convenient.</li>
      <li>Kind of feels like it ruins the point of a big pocket to not be able to put big things in it though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I prefer this light blue color since it seems to stand out better inside my handbag which has a black lining.</li>
      <li>Or you could put this in a normal (but large) satchel</li>
      <li>If your purses come in many shapes and sizes, this is still handy to avoid having to drop stuff into an endless pit if your bag doesn&#x27;t really have a lot of pockets and such, but you are going to have to empty it out and shift all the contents each time you change your bag as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s perfectly decent.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this particular purse organizer to anyone.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this item, in whatever color you prefer.</li>
      <li>From the first time I pulled it out of the bag, a major seam was coming undone.</li>
      <li>so it holds baby things but looks prettier than the rather utilitarian looking diaper bags that I normally see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>loved this i put it is one of my big tote bags i use it to keep all my small things in</li>
      <li>It easily hold and organizes all the stuff I think is necessary, plus there is room around it to put bigger things.  </li>
      <li>So if you only use wide shallow bags, this is perfect.</li>
      <li>i had mine for almost a year and it still looks new .</li>
      <li>I have already put in the stuff I usually end up switching over and it fits everything plus has some more room to grow.</li>
      <li>far as a purse goes</li>
      <li>(and I bought this when totes were really the only purse you could use fashionably.)</li>
      <li>you could fit their essentials in the outside and fit a teddy bear or doll in the inside and put doll accessories or other small toys in the outer pockets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Much sturdier than I expected for the price.</li>
      <li>Unless you put large, rigid items in each pocket and compartment, it CONSTANTLY slouches down like a pair of pants when they fall to the floor.</li>

<li> If you carry a medium to large handbag with little or no organizational pockets, this is just for you!</li>
<li> , you could still use this as a luggage organizer and fill the outside pockets with bits and pieces and you could fill the main interior compartment with lingerie and socks, things that usually rattle around and get lost in the suitcase without being contained like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I like use big tote bags because I have to much but sometimes was hard to find the things.</li>

<li> If the little pockets and such were on the inside of the organizer where you could see it that would make sense.</li>
<li> I had to down size my work bags to one bag.</li>
<li> Things like earbuds, eye mask, ipod, purse toothbrush, and all the other little bits you need on an overnight flight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The brand-new smell is a little off-putting, but I&#x27;m hoping that will go away with time.  </li>
<li> Fell apart in a few weeks without any heavy use.</li>
<li> This is not meant to be a purse in and of itself, so your purse should be the thing you are hauling about everyday.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used it to store small odds and ends in my luggage</li>
<li> The organizer does have a lot of pockets, but the material is so slick that the organizer slides around in the bottom of my pocketbook.  </li>

    <li> Very handy. Use it all the time.</li>
    <li> awesome has all the organization that anyone could ask for i lover them</li>
    <li> I was expecting sth really small but turn out to be a medium size with a loooott of pockets perfect for me. fits in all my purses. the item came one week earlier than the estimated delivery.</li>
    <li> Love it, i use it every day.</li>
    <li> If you could see the stuff i carry in my purse, then you would understand why this get a 5 star rating, everything organized and in place, easy to locate, without even looking inside the bag........thank you</li>
    <li> Great deal.. Now I&#x27;m all organized, I can use my big hand bags now and not have to dig through everything that has fallen to the bottom</li>
    <li> it fit into my bag just the way i wanted it too and it hold all my stuff happy happy</li>

    <li> Just the same as what I expected. It&#x27;s convenient to keep keys, cell phone, wallets and makeups. When you change handbags, just move this small bag to the new one, instead of moving everything on by one.</li>
    <li> Pretty, lightweight, many pockets holding everything I need. Just pull it out and put in a different purse and you are swiftly on your way.</li>
    <li> perfect bag fast shipping will buy again thanks!</li>
    <li> love it! Now I can find all the thing from my purse! I like use big tote bags because I have to much but sometimes was hard to find the things. Now with this organiser insert don&#x27;t have that problem anymore. Easy to change it the one bag to another one! Is perfect! I recommend it.</li>
    <li> From the first time I pulled it out of the bag, a major seam was coming undone. It&#x27;s in a hard place to stitch up because of the zippers.&lt;br /&gt;I love the idea and it fits in my purse well but I have this stupid string that keeps undoing itself every time I use my purse and then it balls up and gets caught on doors and stuff and is really annoying.</li>
    <li> Nice insert with a lot of space. Great deal for the price. This is for large purses.I would purchase another one</li>
    <li> Love this bag. Makes my life easier Wher I chance purses.</li>
    <li> It took up a lot of space in the bag, and didn&#x27;t turn out to be very useful for me. Good concept, but maybe it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
    <li> The organizer does have a lot of pockets, but the material is so slick that the organizer slides around in the bottom of my pocketbook.  I guess if I had a smaller purse with a better fit for the organizer, it would work better.</li>
    <li> Love this bag. It fits most of my bags and I can have everything organized.  I want one in every color</li>
    <li> I had to down size my work bags to one bag. This worked to keep everything organized and in place in the larger bag.</li>
    <li> I had purchased a similar product months ago and wanted another one for my gym bag but after a few uses, the side panel ripped!  It looks like the fabric gave away because of the stitches...oh well! At least the one I got for my mom is still in prime condition.</li>
    <li> I have never like the big, open bag purses.  I just could never find anything easily.  Well, my mother-in-law gave me the most beautiful big, open bag...and it just sat there -  Until I found this insert.  It easily hold and organizes all the stuff I think is necessary, plus there is room around it to put bigger things.  For the price, this is perfect!</li>
    <li> Greatb deal for the price.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for... Only lasted a couple of weeks before things started coming apart</li>
    <li> Keeps my bag tidy enough that I don&#x27;t have to dig around too much. Now if I could just put stuff in the same pocket every time...Much sturdier than I expected for the price.</li>
    <li> If you carry a medium to large handbag with little or no organizational pockets, this is just for you! I bought two and both have fit perfectly in each bag I used. When I went shopping for a new bag, I pulled out this organizer to make certain it would fit. This is just the size for those nylon or leather &#x27;shopper&#x27; handbags that have no inside pockets.</li>
    <li> I bought one in purple but I prefer this light blue color since it seems to stand out better inside my handbag which has a black lining. Now I can easily find all my stuff in my bag. Highly recommend this item, in whatever color you prefer.</li>
    <li> I measured out the specs prior to purchasing because a lot of the reviews said that it was smaller than they expected. It is on the smaller side, but it will do what I need it to do switching between purses and diaper bags. Be forewarned it took about three weeks to get, but it does give you an estimate when you check out. I have already put in the stuff I usually end up switching over and it fits everything plus has some more room to grow.</li>
    <li> The pockets are ample and convenient. I like the expansion snaps. Only problem with this (and I t almost makes it unusable), is that the item has no means of support. Unless you put large, rigid items in each pocket and compartment, it CONSTANTLY slouches down like a pair of pants when they fall to the floor. Makes it impossible to find items. I&#x27;m constantly having to fish around for the handles to pull it upright to find anything. That being said, for the price I paid, it&#x27;s adequate (just cut a rigid piece of plastic or cardboard and insert it into the zip pockets).</li>
    <li> I really am happy with this. It looks and feels exactly as it should a lot of pockets. I am happy to have this!</li>
    <li> Love this....took a while to get here but I plan to buy some more and hand them out to relatives. It keeps me organized.</li>
    <li> this was the worst product on amazon I&#x27;ve ever purchased, but you get what you pay for. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this particular purse organizer to anyone.</li>
    <li> loved this i put it is one of my big tote bags i use it to keep all my small things in so i can find them easy . it has lots of pockets and three big pockets .i loved this handbag insert and the price was great. i had mine for almost a year and it still looks new .</li>
    <li> Excelent product. Perfect size</li>
    <li> Great item can use it for anything. Well order more.</li>
    <li> Love it, it holds everything and keeps my purse / workbag super organized</li>
    <li> Great for large bags.  It fits perfectly and now I don&#x27;t have my things just thrown into my bag.  The brand-new smell is a little off-putting, but I&#x27;m hoping that will go away with time.  My one problem is that one of the zippers is stuck.  It doesn&#x27;t close all the way.</li>
    <li> Great size for home or purse</li>
    <li> As described-Made well-Good packaging &amp; Fast shipping- I am happy with item and Seller-A+++++++</li>
    <li> Horrible.  Fell apart in a few weeks without any heavy use.</li>
    <li> So amazing for the price. Very convenient.</li>
    <li> Keeps everything I need daily together and to change a purse or put it into a tote is so easy! No more forgeting my lipstick or a pen!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very handy organizer. I&#x27;ve used it to store small odds and ends in my luggage so I at least know they are all in one place and I can get to them easily. Things like earbuds, eye mask, ipod, purse toothbrush, and all the other little bits you need on an overnight flight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as a purse goes I had intended to use it after my trip to store all my things with the idea that I could move it from one purse to another without having to shift any of my belongings. The thing I had forgotten was that different purses have different shapes. So my satchel and shoulder bags work perfectly with this, but a clutch doesn&#x27;t work, nor does a cross body, nor a messenger bag, nor does a a Summer tote (and I bought this when totes were really the only purse you could use fashionably.) So if you only use wide shallow bags, this is perfect. If your purses come in many shapes and sizes, this is still handy to avoid having to drop stuff into an endless pit if your bag doesn&#x27;t really have a lot of pockets and such, but you are going to have to empty it out and shift all the contents each time you change your bag as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have complained about the quality of the bag. I think it&#x27;s perfectly decent. This is not meant to be a purse in and of itself, so your purse should be the thing you are hauling about everyday. If you use only this and call it your purse you are using it incorrectly and of course you will have problems with it. As it is, I&#x27;ve found it has lasted for several months of daily use and almost daily taking it out and putting it back into another purse with no issues on quality. It&#x27;s held up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of the organizer isn&#x27;t ideal, however. If the little pockets and such were on the inside of the organizer where you could see it that would make sense. As it is, when you put it in your purse it pushes against the side of the purse, so you have to shift things to see the side to get something out of its pocket. Probably not an ideal set up. Easily remedied by basically not filling the main interior compartment, or only putting something small and thin like a wallet or phone in. Kind of feels like it ruins the point of a big pocket to not be able to put big things in it though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you put very few things or very thin things in the outside pocket you can easily access the pockets and the main interior space though. If you do that, the main space easily holds a tablet, a wallet, a phone. Or you can not put any of those in and fit 3 summer size paperbacks or one harry potter sized book in the main compartment. In case you like to fill your purse with books that is. I now I love to have those on hand for my morning commute. Somehow ebooks don&#x27;t satisfy me in the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you take my traveling suggestion, you could still use this as a luggage organizer and fill the outside pockets with bits and pieces and you could fill the main interior compartment with lingerie and socks, things that usually rattle around and get lost in the suitcase without being contained like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or if you buy this for your child&#x27;s suitcase (it would certainly fit, and it&#x27;s cheap enough you wouldn&#x27;t care if they messed it up pretty quickly) you could fit their essentials in the outside and fit a teddy bear or doll in the inside and put doll accessories or other small toys in the outer pockets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do that for luggage this could also be helpful for a diaper bag. Those things are huge so this would definitely fit, and it would be perfect for holding pacifiers and such in the pockets and diapers in the main compartment. Or you could put this in a normal (but large) satchel so it holds baby things but looks prettier than the rather utilitarian looking diaper bags that I normally see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This could also be an interesting organizer for a junk drawer in a deep kitchen or office drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically this is a good organizer that can work in lots of places for lots ofpurposes, but you should remember that it isn&#x27;t really meant to be hauled around itself and needs to be placed in another bag if you want it to be portable.</li>
