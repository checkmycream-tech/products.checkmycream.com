    <li> The fragrance of this left my eyes itching and watering...it felt good going on but then my hands felt dry very quickly.  overall it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I was given a tube of the Olive Oil and Chamomile anti-ageing creme and it is fabulous. It removes the brown spots that come as you get older, and really makes my hands feel soft.

Very few hand cremes nowadays actually remove the brown spots.</li>
    <li> bought for wife but I have also used it as I am a diabetic and this hand cream keeps my hands for getting to harsh and chapped, wife suggested I use it and we now both use it</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  It feels great and smells great too.</li>
    <li> I bought this hand cream while in Greece.  I am so happy that I can also purchase it here on Amazon! It is truly luxurious and makes my hands feel great!!</li>

    <li> I initially bought this cream from a little  specialty shop that was going out of business.My hands were so cracked , my knuckles were actually bleeding!  I&#x27;d tried Eucerin, Aquaphor and many other expensive and supposedly strong moisturizers, Aphrodite&#x27;s olive oil cream was the only cream I tried that immediately softened my very dry hands and more importantly, lasted longer than a few minutes. A little goes a long way. My knuckles healed within a day or two and now I use it on my dry heels as well. WONDERFUL product, cannot recommend it enough!</li>

    <li> I bought this product when I was visiting my brother in Pennsylvania I could only get a 3 oz. tube for the plane. I could not fine anyplace to buy it here. I was so happy to see Amazon had it as an add on. I bought four large tubes it makes your skin so silky and soft I just love it. I hope in the future they carry the product all the time.

    <li> ...and not greasy! My chapped hands are doing much better since I started using it. I would certainly recommend it to anyone who has to wash their hands a lot during the day!</li>
    <li> Good but somewhat thick for hand cream!</li>
    <li> Makes your hands smooooooooth!&lt;br /&gt;The olive oil in this works wonders on&lt;br /&gt;your hands. Use it elsewhere too for&lt;br /&gt;smooth skin.</li>
    <li> I have started using the whole line of Aphrodite products. Natural ingredients and great product. Living in a cold climate makes skin dry. These products are excellent for moisturizing and tge smells of summer.</li>
    <li> Love the body lotion more than the hand cream and thought that was what I ordered.  This is good too but I prefer the body lotion.</li>
    <li> Soapy smell. Didn&#x27;t do much to my rough hands but some chemicals in this cream made my dry skin worse. It suppose to have no parabans but it does have tons of chemicals. It is not all natural.</li>
    <li> Bought this lotion while in Greece and I LOVE IT. It leave hands feeling silky and the Pomegranate smells amazing! I have bad allergies so any strong smell will keep me sneezing all day.

    <li> Great for dry hands this time of year.  Nice scent that&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
