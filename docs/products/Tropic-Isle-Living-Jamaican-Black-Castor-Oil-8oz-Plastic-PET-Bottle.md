<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 1 month seen and Jamaicans black Castor oil it really works my daughters and I loves it.</li>
    <li> I Love this oil, so I bought myself a bottle to use.</li>
    <li> This does work to Reggie hair</li>
    <li> Its very thick and I could have gotten it cheaper at the local beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> I have relaxed hair and it works very well on relaxed hair as well. It helps to control scalp itching and makes the hair very soft. Been using it for about 3 years on and off and it works well everytime I use. I have fast growing hair but this definitely helps with the increase in thickness. Get it!!! U won&#x27;t regret it. Hope I&#x27;ve helped!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Keeps my hair well oiled and does not stain anything. I like how thick it is. I feel it protecting the natural hair. Also, you don&#x27;t need much and it lasts long</li>
    <li> Its amazing and IG works great! I see a difference in hair growth.</li>
    <li> So I have been using this for 3-4 months now. I mixed this with my E-oil and the results is amazing.</li>
    <li> great for hair but smell not so great.</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff... This product really work!</li>
    <li> Until I used the entire bottle. It made my daughter&#x27;s natural hair verrrrrrry thick...just no length. I actually ended up preferring to use it in combination with our body lotion. Here in this form it was perfect.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and I&#x27;m hoping it will aid in my hair growth. It&#x27;s very thick, so I mix it with EVOO for easier distribution.</li>
    <li> I like the product but it smells like cigarette smoke to me.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results with this product.</li>
    <li> My hair LOVES JBC Oil, I have fine 4b/c texture and wear a short/mid afro. It thickens and protects my hair.  My temple areas have grown out more, no more thinning edges. I also use this with JBC hair food, rotating the 2 every other time I oil my scalp.  Good Stuff!</li>
    <li> I look at many reviews about this product. On this site and also other sites. Many said their hair grew back within couple weeks. Mines is taking longer I guess because I have alopecia areata. It is growing, Im happy about that. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. Will return once the hair has totally grown back. Patience for me</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for hair growth on thinning hair areas and it seems to be really working.  A beautician told me about it and I like this brand</li>
    <li> I have been using it for 3 weeks and have not seen anything yet , i use it with shampoo  every single  day , and put it on my eyebrows  aslo. hopefully the hair will grow .</li>
    <li> Ive been using this castor oil for a while now &amp; slowly but surely its workin. My hairline is thinning &amp; I wanted to grow it back.My mom said to use JBC on the thinning areas...I have been doin just that for months now and its workin... i also take hair/skin/nails vitamins as well...but nonetheless it does work!!!!</li>
    <li> JBCO is wonderful and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> amazing hair growth! i mix this with coconut oil as well .. my hair was completely damaged and falling out.. i can combed my hair now and no hair falls out! i will def buy more after i run out</li>
    <li> Last a very long time.</li>
    <li> The stuff is pretty chronic it&#x27;s a dark and refined blend of Castro oil. I am a Castrol oil fish Yono I know what I&#x27;m talking about. Even though this brand doesn&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s organic it is still some quality stuff. It&#x27;s a well-balanced blend and should be used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a natural hair girl and I love this product!  My hair stays softer much longer.  Only regret is that I only brought one bottle :(</li>
    <li> Maybe this will work better for someone with natural hair but this is just too thick for my relaxed hair. Even when I did leave it in my hair I didnt see any benefits except dirty greasy hair.  Would only use to put in a deep conditioner before washing. Too heavy to actually style my hair with. I prefer a lighter oil such as coconut oil. Im transitioning to natural currently. Maybe i&#x27;ll try it again when i&#x27;m natural.</li>
    <li> This stuff is my all-time favorite &amp;#34;beauty secret.&amp;#34; I often use it to moisturize extra dry skin and feet, or to heal blemishes and cuts. My favorite thing to do with Jamaican Black Castor Oil, however, is to cut this thick oil with some virgin coconut oil, smear the concoction all over my scalp/hair, wrap my oily head in a shower cap, pop on a winter hat on top of that, and leave it on for a few hours/overnight. My hair is absurdly soft and silky afterwards, and even though I dye-and-fry my hair often, I have almost no split ends thanks to this regimen.</li>
    <li> Thick oil with distinct smell but works well to moisturize and my hair feels thicker already! I am going to orde rmore</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a while now and I absolutely love it. It makes my hair and new growth so soft and my hair has grown I dnt believe u can change the thickness of ur hair u can&#x27;t change wats in ur genetics but my husband noticed n told me my hair looks thicker. Idk its almost my second month revisiting this product n idk y I ever stopped using it. I recommend you order yours thru naturally me here on amazon they ship quik</li>
    <li> I tried using this product a few times, and I&#x27;m still not sold. Maybe my hair is too fine, but it seems to make it feel heavy. I will give it a few more tries before I completely rule it out but I don&#x27;t know about this one...</li>
    <li> Been using this brand of castor oil for years. It&#x27;s the only one that works. I use it on my hairline to keep it full. Once  in the morning, then before bed at night.</li>
    <li> I bought this product about 3 weeks ago. I am trying to grow out my thinning edges. Although they are still thin, I am seeing where the hair is starting to fill out more.</li>
    <li> Before I started using JBCO, my edges we thinned out by a 6 month protective style challenge with micro braids. Yea, not a great idea! So I started looking into some things to help me grow them back out and stumbled upon this bottle of goodness. I have been using this product for a month now and boy, do my edges tell a completely different story. My hair, ends, edges and all, have transformed into soft tresses!! I use it at night after my Co- wash and braid my hair back in two, use the JBCO on my edges and seal my ends, wrap it up, and in the morning its amazing soft. I keep telling myself to keep my hands out of my head :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If yo have dry, thinning, uncooperative hair, Try THIS JBCO. It wont let you down ! ! !</li>
    <li> Is great! I been using it daily especially on my edges and is def growing!!</li>
    <li> I liked the quanity I received, the price and what  the product did for my hair which was as the bottle stated.</li>
    <li> Really good! Really  promt service!! I plan to buy more!!! I use it for my moisterizer and hair cream. GREAT</li>
    <li> I use JBCO nearly twice a day and I have noticed a great improvement in my hair. I seal my ends with it and I also massage my scalp with it. Great for those who need thicker oils.</li>
    <li> Love the oil, makes my hair feel wonderfully soft.  Will be purchasing again when needed.</li>
    <li> JBCO was recommended to me by a friend who had used it and had great results.  I ordered the product and immediately began using it.  At first I thought it was great because it made my hair soft and moisturized (I was about eight months into my natural hair journey). About a week after using it, I noticed shedding but I thought it was due to it being Summer (my hair dries out in the Summer months).  I continued to use it, ignoring the warnings.  About a month later most of my hair had come out on the sides and in the back.  I eventually had to chop my hair off because it was so uneven and damaged.  After I stopped using it, the shedding stopped. My sister used the product and the same thing happened to her hair.  We didn&#x27;t put the two together until it it was too late. It may work for some but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I have used this product on a regular basis and I really did not see any noticeable difference.  My hair has always grown fast so that is not the issue.  I guess I thought there was something extraordinary about this, but to my surprise, it is just a heavy lubricant and very greasy.</li>
    <li> I give Jamaican Black Castor Oil 5 stars because it really works on hair to promote hair growth. It also does a wonder for skin and feet. This is one of the best products I ever purchased. I plan on being a long time customer. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I like the product is very thick so I don&#x27;t need to use so much. Yes it does have a burnt smell but I cut it with avocado oil and apricot oil. I like it and uses the oil once to twice a week on my hair.  It take a little longer than expected to get the product. I had to call the seller twice to confirm it was being mailed.</li>
    <li> I previously bought the 4 ounce size, and a little went a long way. It has a thick consistency and herbal scent. I am pretty certain it has increased my hair growth rate. The key is MASSAGING it into the scalp! Definitely a staple!!!!!</li>
    <li> I HAVE ONLY HAD IT A WEEK BUT I WILL SEE IF IT LIVE UP TO WHAT EVRY ON ESLE HAS SAID</li>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery</li>
    <li> My mom used this on my hair as a kid,and my hair was long,soft, and thick.  I recently starting using it again to grow back my hair that became damaged from chemical relaxers. My the hair on my hairline is growing back thick and healthy like it was when I was a little girl.</li>
    <li> My order arrived within a matters of days. The quality was what I expected. I would order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Omg I love this product it really works my edges are so healthy and they suffer from excessive extention use!! It works for slicking back you&#x27;re hair to get that Kim k pony tail look and as a frizz control its thick but when dry nice and smooth came on time will deff buy again!!</li>
    <li> I order this product and it shipped to my house IN THREE DAYS!!!! I was so surprised by the shipping, I have been using it for 2 days now and I already see New Growth!!! WOW I bought all the products like the Shampoo and Protien Condtioner and all cam pro packed. Thanks i love the product...planing on going natural can wait!</li>
    <li> I really like this product and it is always delivered quickly. The service I have received has been great.</li>
    <li> This product is great for thickening hair but I find castor oil too heavy to put on my scalp however I put a little on my eyebrows at night and they have thickened up and filled in nicely.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in timely manner but applicator was not included as advertised.  Product is very good as it seems to grow hair fast and thick.  It is part of my regular hair care regiment.  Try it.  You will be pleased.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the truth! I use it nightly on my edges. It doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest so if smell is a big factor for you I suggest getting the one with the lavender scent.</li>
    <li> I love my jbco...using it consistently on my hair I see great results with the thickness and healthy shine!</li>
    <li> After using this product for a week only on my hair, I noticed it help reduce the amount of dandruff that I normally have. I would recommend this product for anyone who would like to get away from using a bunch of \\&quot;gook\\&quot; on their hair.</li>
    <li> After using this product for my relaxed hair and my 4 yr old daughter&#x27;s natural hair, I have noticed a difference in a very short period of time.  I mix a small amt in conditioner, scalp oil, and also use to seal after I moisturize.  A lil goes a long way. Can not wait to purchase the lavendar scented oil!...</li>
    <li> I got this product 2 days after I purchased it. I love this stuff. It&#x27;s great! I wish that the price was lower and I can&#x27;t really afford to purchase this as much as I&#x27;d like to. I think that I paid about 18.00 including the shipping. I can&#x27;t say that it wasn&#x27;t worth the price but it&#x27;s just way too much for my budget. I&#x27;ll be using regular drugstore castor oil from now on because is works just as good, if not the same. Drugstore castor oil is 5x cheaper. I had to give this product 5 stars because I do love it but the price is really high (for me).</li>
    <li> I use this product as an oil treatment before i was my hair.  It really makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> After searching for solutions to my itchy dry skin and scalp problems I stumbled across a blog that mentioned the various uses for Jamaican Black Castor Oil.  Since I&#x27;d tried almost everything else I decided to give this a shot.  That was the best decision that I could have made.  After two weeks my sking began to look healthy again, the dark dry patches were gone and the constant itching was gone as well.  I also use it as a hot oil treatment for my hair and noticed the results immediately.  I was a bit turned off by the smokey smell at first but the smell does not linger very long and can be masked very easily.  It is safe and gentel enough to be used by all members of my family.  Since I have a child with allergies and sensitive skin Jamacian Black Castor Oil has been a God send for the both of us.</li>
    <li> I did the BC 2 months ago and I have been using this product a little less than that along with other carrier oils. I just use this product every other night and when I wake up my hair is still moisturized. I&#x27;ve seen some growth but nothing drastic. I also just recently started to put this product on my eyebrows and have seen some change already! I still have more than half the bottle left..so this stuff will def last! I will give an update in a few months hopefully with some amazing results!</li>
    <li> The results are okay i didnt see dramatic changes but the oil is very thick and used olive oil as a carry oil. When mixed with shea butter oil it worked a little better. overall it is an awesome product not sure what the best use for it would be. In hair again it might work for you better than me. It is not the cheap kind you can tell a difference.</li>
    <li> The only reason I give it 3 star is there are cheaper option available for same quality castor oil.  Castor oil is good for hair and also good for regrowing hair. I have been using castor oil along with coconut oil for past 3 months and I can see some baby small hair growing in places where I was bald. I haven&#x27;t cut hair for 3 months now and am planning to keep it for some time.  I bought JBCO with jasmine. I thought it would be black in color or something, but it was same colour as my existing castor oil. The only difference is that the castor oil I got from Indian store is much cheaper. Around 16oz bottle for 5$ or so compared to this JBCO. Indians use this for cooking, hair oil, baby massage, laxative etc.  I would recommend going down to near by Indian store and buy castor oil bottle from there. I got \\&quot;Laxmi\\&quot; brand which I trust as I use other products from same brand. You will save 10$ or more for the same quantity. I found Indian castor oil to be a bit stickier. So I use coconut oil to make it more fluid. The only problem is that oil becomes solid and have to be put in hot water from tap for 2 to 3 minutes. I live in seattle where weather is pretty cold.  Bottom line if you want to save some money walk down to a near by Indian store and buy castor oil from there. Much cheaper than JBCO or walgreens or local store near you.</li>
    <li> works great just too think for my hair.</li>
    <li> I heard alot of good things about the JBCO and finally decided to try it myself. So far I have noticed that my hair is much thicker and growing faster than it ever did. I am on my second order and definitely will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I RECEIVED THE JAMAICA BLACK CASTOR OIL 2 DAYS AFTER ORDERING.  iT WAS WRAPPED AND SECURELY PACKAGED.  THIS IS MY FIRST TIME USING THIS PRODUCT BUT IT WORKS REALLY WELL AND I WILL ORDER AGAIN AND AGAIN!!</li>
    <li> This product REALLY DOES WORK..if you want your hair to be thick or you need some hair growth i highly recommended this oil to anyone. Ive used it for 2 months will I was wearing box braids and it made my hair more thick and plus it gave me LOTSSS OF NEW GROWTH. I used it 2x and week and it helped!!!!!I&#x27;m excited for anyone who uses this product because you will see amazing results. &amp; the smell may be strong at first but you will get used to it. its not bad at all.</li>
    <li> A lot of people says it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t work for them maybe because there not consistent with it and get impatient and just stop the whole process, it doesn&#x27;t work over nite you got to give it atleast 60 days to see great results but I have purchased mango and lime Jamaican black castor oil and it worked great I&#x27;m purchasing this because it&#x27;s cheaper for more oz......</li>
    <li> Just started using it. Got it because my hair is thinning and breaking. Heard it does wnders for those type of hair issues so hopefully it works</li>
    <li> I love this product! I brought it for my edges which got pulled out. It&#x27;s growing my edges so nicely. The only thing I do not like is the smell.</li>
    <li> Product is great. Not sure if it aids in hair growth just started using it.</li>
    <li> I received my order before the date scheduled! It was packaged and shipped extremely well. The Jamaican Black Castor Oil is well worth the money. The scent is pleasant and the oil is not too heavy. It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
    <li> I like this product, always keep one on hand.  Had many good uses.</li>
    <li> I am currently transitioning back to my natural hair. I&#x27;d read that castor oil was very good for promoting hair health and growth so I decided to try some from the bottle I already had in my medicine cabinet. It worked great!! My hair loves it.     After reading more articles and forums Jamaican Black Castor Oil kept popping up. Everyone said it was so great - must have. When my bottle of castor oil ran out I decided to replace it with some JBCO. I bought 2 bottles to make the S&amp;H worthwhile. I&#x27;m halfway through the first bottle now.    Hmmm... Well, my hair still loves castor oil. In that respect the JBCO is 3 stars. However, I see no difference between JBCO and drugstore castor oil. I&#x27;ll be picking up my next bottle of castor oil from Walgreens.</li>
    <li> I live by this oil for my naturally textured hair. It does have s smoky smell that may bother some people. Just mix with a drop of lavender oil or other hair cremes and you will get the best moisturizing experience. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Works great on my hair and rash</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any changes</li>
    <li> The oil was OK. Didn&#x27;t experience any hair growth while using it. I guess it could be a good moisturizer</li>
    <li> Thick and works magic for added moisture! This thing stinks like smoke and KAKA! lol! I put in some lavender oil to mask the smell. I like the smell of Haitian castor oil much better! Jamaican and Haitian castor oil both get the job done.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product! I started using it back in march 2010 to thicken my hair and to grow some bald spots it took a couple of months but it worked. It is now August and i have notice a big difference in my hair. It&#x27;s a lot thicker, stronger, shiner, and it help my split ends as well.I have learned to mix it with another carrier oil to thin it out a bit and to stop the itching.I noticed if i used it by itself my head itched like crazy but i started to see results there was no way i was giving up! I clarify my hair once every 2wks so i want have build up I started to see results after wearing my hair in twist for 3mths i got almost 3 1/2inches of new growth. When i took my hair down everyone was so surprised how much my hair had grown and its worked on my mom as well she had small gray hairs growing back. I dyed her hair before i started using it on her hair when her hair started to grow back you could see the little new gray hairs coming from her scalp.I wish it came in a bigger bottle because i put a little in my shampoo,conditioner, and my deep conditioners as well it makes your hair soft.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and it is assisting my hair in making progress. I have very thin edges, and over the last few weeks I have noticed some growth. I use this product every other day and massage my thin areas with it. It is a very thick oil, so you only have to use a small amount. I am very pleased with this product and would suggest it to anyone who is looking for a hair product to promote hair growth. Also I have used it to thicken my eyebrows and I have noticed a great difference in my eyebrow thickness.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing...it softened my hair and I am starting to notice that it looks thicker. Will definitely purchase again and recommend to my friends and family</li>
    <li> i love this. it helped my eyebrows grow</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It is a very thick oil and it isnt runny at all.&lt;br /&gt;My hairline has came out due to tight braids..etc..&lt;br /&gt;This product has really grown my edges back great. What I do is put&lt;br /&gt;the product on my hairline and do a scalp massage everyday.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I wish it smelled better. It isnt a smell that is just&lt;br /&gt;terriable but I wish it had a fresh scent.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I love the product and I will buy it again and&lt;br /&gt;recomend it to my family,clients and friends.</li>
    <li> This is a decent product.  It pretty much does what it says it will do but you must be consistent with using it like any other product.  Massaging the areas where you need it the most is going to be a plus when using this product.  I have seen growth in areas I needed.  Good product for the money.  It does work for all you skeptics!</li>
    <li> I got this product for an excellent price and the quantity is excellent too.  It moisturizes my hair--reduces frizz and works well with the other hair care products I use.</li>
    <li> First, I must say that I am a relaxed chick with hair that is approximately APL. I plan to reach there within the next few months and know that this product will help me do so. This is the best thing that I have ever done for my hair and I am sure my hair loves me because of it. My only thing to say is make sure you don&#x27;t put it in more than two or three times a week cause it could clog your pores. Since I only wash my hair once a week I put it in on my wash day (when my scalp is clean and ready), and then three days later. If you keep at this for a few months you will be amazed witht the results. Also remember to keep protective styles in.   P.S. The company is great and product is deliverd really quick. Good Luck!</li>
    <li> This oil was suggested to strengthen my hair and promote growth.  So far its made it really soft. The best is yet to come.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh, love this stuff already.... i just received this today. Ive already applied it to just my edges and its a dramatic difference. I applied it on wet hair and it soften my dry hair as well as detangled. i have 4c hair, this organic oil is way better and more logical to buy then any other beauty supply product. I will say im using it along with coconut oil but the product along is well worth every star. thank you my hair thanks you.</li>
    <li> This product arrive on time. I love using this product in my liquid black soap and she butter lotions that I make. It helps to keep my skin soft and my hair from drying out.</li>
    <li> I recorded this video a few months ago when I first recieved the product. It is great for moisturizing my hair but at times when i put it on my scalp it feels a bit irritating like there is alot of build up on my scalp. here is the video […]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product shy of 2 months. I&#x27;m only 9 Weeks post relaxed and my new growth feels like I&#x27;m at least 15 or 16 weeks post. I&#x27;ve been applying the oil to my scalp 3x&#x27;s a week.  You will not be disappointed if your consistent with its use.  I only gave 4 stars because the shipping fee was outrageous.</li>
    <li> works great will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product my hair has thickened up alot.</li>
    <li> After seeing so many great reviews on youtube, I decided to order this product.  This oil is very thick so a little bit goes a long way.  You can always mix it with regular castor oil to thin it out.  I have seen great results with my hair growth which I am very happy about since I recently did the big chop.  This oil also works great on my face and in my whipped shea butter mixture.  I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> got this for my mother, she loves it. :)</li>
    <li> Ok, have to say I really like this oil, ALOT.  I have tried several brands. I even had a Jamaican friend bring me a bottle of castor oil back with her and tried that.  But none of them seemed as effective as this. So this is the one I wanted.  It has a dark color, rich and thick consistency.  Really takes my afro-textured locks to the next level by keeping them extra moisturized in the cold.  It has amazing healing properties that address my dry, itchy scalp.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using it as much in the summer unless I thin it out with grapeseed oil or jojoba oil, which I&#x27;ve done before.  If you suffer with those nasty little &#x27;fairy knots&#x27;, this is a MUST-have to apply to your ends.  It really does work to smooth out the cuticle and helps minimize the natural strands from curling into knots. Highly recommended for all hair types as it is natural, nurturing and just plain nice for our hair!</li>
    <li> Very good castor oil. I like it. Will buy again</li>
    <li> I love this product on my hair.  My scalp is always dry and flaky, but after I started using this on my scalp, I don&#x27;t have that problem any more.  It is so great that I have started using in on my skin after I shower.    Most products I use only last a few hours and my skin is dry again.It soothes my dry skin and it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Size is a great value&lt;br /&gt; Prompt delivery also!!! Thanks</li>
    <li> Awesome product just smells funny</li>
    <li> I love this for my face and hair.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this product for about 3 months and my hair has never been softer. I have 4b type hair and it can be very kinky/corse.  I started using JBCO to seal my ends after twisting.  I also apply the oil to my scalp and massage it at night, and add about 1-2 tsp. to my deep conditioner. I&#x27;ve also noticed some hair growth since Ive been doing my scalp massages with JBCO more regularity. And that&#x27;s all I can really say.  It may be more pricey than regular castor oil so that&#x27;s why I give it 4stars, but as far as its perfomence I think it is the business!!! for anyone who has Natural hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered a 8oz bottle and or received two 4oz bottle that don&#x27;t really smell like JBCO and doesn&#x27;t feel like the consistence like the JBCO I got in lavender</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with how fast this product shipped. I was able to start using the JBCO immediately for my hair. A lot of people complain about the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. It is a bit lighter in weight than the cold pressed castor oil which is a plus for my fine hair strands. I will be repurchasing this in the future.</li>
    <li> What I expected, LOVE IT. Now I hope my hair grows longer... Youtube has me convinced lol.</li>
    <li> This is a great wholesome oil. It has a very strong smell that takes some getting used to, kindof a woodsy burnt smell. It makes your new growth very soft.</li>
    <li> Really works grew my edges back</li>
    <li> This is my second time buying this product. It came in record time and was wrapped secure. I use it for hair, skin and nails and love every bit of it. I am sure this will become a regular for me.</li>
    <li> love it love it love it.  Thought i&#x27;d already written a review.  will definitely re-order from them.</li>
    <li> Definitely helps my hair health. I have very fine hair so I regularly do a lot of styling to it, which unfortunately leads to damage. I put it all over my scalp and my ends about once a month and leave it on all night. Just a warning, you really have to lather up your hair to wash it out completely. But afterwards, my hair is so soft and looks and feels very healthy.</li>
    <li> New growth every where!!! I have dreads its making my roots thicker. They was thinning because of thyroid;( but now it&#x27;s growing back:)</li>
    <li> Did&#x27;t but this because I like it, I purchased it because I remembered my mother would give it to us as kids for our health.</li>
    <li> I mixed it with coconut oil to help with the smell. I have noticed hair growth around my edges.</li>
    <li> I have been using Jamaican Black Castor oil for approximately one month. I use on my edges 2-3 times a week. I can see a difference already. I also mix with my loc cream to do two strand twist. My hair looks and feels healthier. I am very pleased with this product and will continue to purchase. The reviews I read were instrumental in my buying this product. They were accurate regarding the results one could expect my edges were practically bald.</li>
    <li> I like this product well. great for dry hands or feet.  great on hair also  the only thing i didn&#x27;t like was the smell</li>
    <li> My hair feels great with this. I don&#x27;t like the smell but it&#x27;s not a problem unless you overdo it. It&#x27;s very thick too, so just a bit is enough</li>
    <li> The packaging was awesome and the oil is as thick as it says and the other reviews I read. I just wish the smell wasn&#x27;t too small or if another brand will a milder smell can be recommended, I&#x27;ll really appreciate. The oil makes my thick natural hair, easy to manage and moisturized.</li>
    <li> My hair feels awesome and healthy, the smell isn&#x27;t awesome but I cut it with mint and everything is great!</li>
    <li> I bought this prod bc i felt that the edge on the left side of my head was thinning. It has now been 2 months since i first started using it, and i have not been using this religiously, but my mother says she can see new growths which look like peach fuzz near the spot i am treating. I love the smell (smells like castor oil) and i like the consistency(not too thick). I use it at night before bed. I will get myself another bottle after i finish this one!</li>
    <li> This product is my BBBBAAAAABBBY!!</li>
    <li> Shipment arrived quickly and I love this castor oil in my hair and on my skin - worth the extra cost(compared to regular castor oil). I will purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Great product, love it.  Packaging was great also.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical to try this product, as I am with trying any new product on my hair, however, I must say that I was surprised to see how much of a difference it has made in my hair. After reading so many of the reviews online and black hair forums, I finally decided to purchase this product and give it a try. I use this product along with Parachute coconut oil to my ends. I have natural hair that is very course and somewhat fine in texture. I used to receive a lot of breakage and started to get frustrated because many products state that they are good for natural hair and promote healthy thick hair, but fail to do so. Immediately after applying this product to my scalp 3 times a week for the first 2 weeks along with coconut oil to my ends daily, I started to see a major difference in my hair. The new growth was much softer, my scalp was not dry, and my hair strands felt thicker/ stronger. I also noticed minimal breakage, if any, and not a lot of hair in my comb after combing my hair. I definitely recommend using this product sparingly since it is rather thick. It may be costly for some, but definitely worth the investment. I will continue to use this product throughout my natural hair journey.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this on my and my daughters hair and it is fantastic. It does have a strong smell from the bottle, but it&#x27;s not noticeable once in our hair. I don&#x27;t a lot on the actual hair because it is a little heavy, but I oil our scalps with it &amp; I&#x27;ve noticed since we&#x27;ve been using it along with the Jamaican Black Castor Oil Shampoo, we haven&#x27;t experienced problems with dandruff like we were prior to using these products. WE HAD EXCESSIVE DANDRUFF AND NOW WE DON&#x27;T HAVE ANY!!!! So yes, I would recommend it to others, and yes, I will be buying it again in the future.</li>
    <li> I had huge knots it took about 4 hours to get out. Over a period I lost about 3 weeks of hair. I guess all the pulling finally mad more hair come out ? So I emailed Damone Roberts,(The Eyebroe King) of Beverly Hills &amp; he suggested this. I was really shocked to get a correspondence back since he is a busy man. Now. Because of that &amp; I&#x27;m using Bioten vitamins &amp; shampoo &amp; conditioner from Whole Foods &amp; my hair lady said I have little baby hairs growing all over my head, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> The quality is awesome.  I could tell right away.  I used in my hair and it made it extremely soft giving it a soothing protecting coat.  I have used regular castor oil in the past but heard so much about the Black Jamaican kind, I finally tried it and have no regrets.  The seller delivered it in a timely manner as well</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t grow edges just sits on hair waist of $$$</li>
    <li> like always. the best for edges and thickness for hair</li>
    <li> i felt bad when i went through the airport wearing a wig called Aspen Honey Lite - see my review on that \\&quot;Harpo Wig\\&quot;.. later.    And of course, i was stopped by security.  Unfortunately, i was carrying my JBCO (Jamaican black castor oil), and they confiscated it.. they were looking at the bottle curiously asking what it&#x27;s for, etc.  All i knew was this.  All was lost when that took that away.. they could have taken the wig instead.    The moment i got home, i ordered a case of this stuff.. If you&#x27;re having dry skin mix this castor oil with shea butter or any body butter, and you&#x27;ll have the smoothest, moist skin.    If you live in an arid climate (like I do) and you have 4B grade (very kinky) natural hair that breaks off due to dryness.  moisturize with a water based moisturizer then \\&quot;seal\\&quot; with JBCO (Jamaican Black Castor Oil). then wrap with a silk scarf.. if you want SERIOUS MOISTURE moisturize, seal,  then wear a processing cap (plastic cap or plastic grocery bag) then cover with scarf... your hair will be very moist in the morning.. (It&#x27;s also known in the hair growing community as the \\&quot;baggy method\\&quot; google it or look for it YOU Tube..</li>
    <li> Rip off no good didn&#x27;t work waste of time and money what else cam I say about this didn&#x27;t work fore okn</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s thicker than I thought it would be but I like it very much.</li>
    <li> I bought this early in my natural journey, because I&#x27;d seen so many people trying it with great results. To date it&#x27;s one of a million different types of oils I&#x27;ll use regularly. It helped my edges grow back better than anything I&#x27;d tried before as well... let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m ordering this again after thinking I&#x27;d found something better.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s helped keep my hair healthy. Strong, moisturized and growing accordingly. No, I don&#x27;t consider any product a super growth, but people have claimed faster growth. But, just buy it! Works wonders!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my young adult granddaughter who uses it on her scalp to increase the thickness and texture of her hair. She had learned of its benefits online.</li>
    <li> It is bringing my edges back.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my hair. Appears to be working by promoting hair growth. I&#x27;m a little impatient and would like to see mega growth but I know progress take time. I do recommend this product because you do see results.</li>
    <li> Saw no improvement from this product</li>
    <li> I am in love with this Jamaican Black Castor Oil (JBCO)! It has a really rich, thick consistency that I think is a higher quality than the castor oils that you can get from your local drug stores. When I put this oil on my scalp &amp; massage it into my hair, it makes my hair so shiny &amp; pliable. It seals in any moisture quickly as well. I have definitely added this to my regular hair maintenance regimen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1st reason I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars is because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it actually gives me the results that I purchased it for. JBCO is supposed to thicken your hair with continued use. I have thick hair already, but I have recently experienced thinning on my temples. Once I use the entire bottle, I think I&#x27;ll be able to know whether it deserves 5 stars. The 2nd reason that I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because of the cost of shipping. I used to have an online business &amp; I know that it didn&#x27;t cost that much to ship things. The bottle wasn&#x27;t that heavy &amp; I paid almost the same for shipping as I did for the product (&amp; it wasn&#x27;t like I requested overnight shipping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this JBCO thickens the hair at my temples; but if it does not, I will still purchase this product again because of it&#x27;s richness, quality, and the way it seals the moisture into my hair!</li>
    <li> I use this product before it good for my hair.</li>
    <li> I love it already I am seeing an improvement in my hair&#x27;s texture, I use it on my nieces as well and we are all loving it, I usually mix it with argon oil as it is a lighter oil and allows for wider distribution of the jamaican black castor oil</li>
    <li> It works like a charm!!! I would definitely recommend this product to everyone. Just know that a little goes a long way so don&#x27;t use too much at one time.</li>
    <li> I am on my journey to going back to my natural hair. During my research of hair products, I heard good things about Jamaican Black Castor Oil. I purchased this product a couple months ago in hopes of achieving thicker, stronger hair. I noticed my scalp itching quite often a few days after I applied the oil. A few more days later I developed a rash. This spread onto my forehead and down my neck. I was itching for weeks and seemed to take forever to go away. Needless to say I am not happy about this purchase. If your really interested in trying it out, by all means do what you feel. I will say that I have somewhat sensitive skin and just wanted to test this out. Good luck....</li>
    <li> The product was delivered way before the posted delivery date. Both my mother and I are using the product for traction alopecia. I have seen a noticeable difference in my edges after 3 weeks of use (applied to traction spots twice per day in the morning and at night). Also, I have used it as a massage oil on my aching muscles (as per recommended by Dr. Oz). The product is also very viscous and a little bit goes a long way... Quality stuff. I&#x27;ll definitely continue to purchase from this company.</li>
    <li> I just opened this product to use. I bought it almost 3 weeks ago but was in the process of moving otherwise i wouldve eritten this review sooner! IT SMELLS LIKE NICOTINE!!!!!  rubbed some on my fingertips and it is thick and a bit &amp;#34;sticky,&amp;#34; as expected, but the overwhelming and OVERPOWERING smell of NOCOTINE is nauseating. Im returning this product ASAP.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping! Can&#x27;t believe I got it that quick! Love the product! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought fora friend&#x27;s wife, she really love it because the oil works very well.</li>
    <li> I have seen great improvement on my eyebrows, and along the sides and lower back of my hair. Wonderful results. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This oil was used as a beauty aid for skin conditioning from hot summer&#x27;s heat and fall&#x27;s dry winds--my claim to fame for healthy skin and hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since mid-August after lots of research and reading  reviews and I can honestly say that it&#x27;s the best for hair growth, repair, and moisturizing. Worth every cent! I&#x27;ve bought 5 bottles total so far just to stock up and have told relatives about it, and now they are thrilled to have it! I wish I&#x27;d known about it sooner! This product does what it says it could (at least for me) and the thinning areas of my scalp have filled in, and it&#x27;s also excellent for the skin. My scalp did itch at first after a few applications, especially in the thinning areas, but I believe that&#x27;s due to the hair follicles being stimulated. The result: I now have thickened, soft, much longer hair; my scalp is well moisturized (and remains this way for days) and the thinning areas (especially) have new growth. It does have a burnt smell that took getting used to but surprisingly I&#x27;ve never had anyone complain about it, so I was worried for nothing! But most importantly, I am so glad to have tried this product and I will never use anything else on my hair! Yes, the oil is thick and smells burnt but it works! I highly recommend others having hair problems to try it, and just give it time to work. It is well worth the time, effort and cost.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I ordered from this seller!! I ordered it to see if it would aid on hair growth. I&#x27;ve only been using the product for about two weeks, so can&#x27;t comment much on its effectiveness. I ordered it on a Friday, and it was here the next Monday with regular shipping, so that was great!!!! After reading how good it is for the skin I started using it for my skin also, and for my eyebrows and eyelashes, I&#x27;ve read it makes them thicker and longer, we&#x27;ll see. It does leaves my skin really soft. As for my hair, I mixed it with almond oil, warm it up a little and massage my scalp everyday before going to sleep. And use a little on the rest of my hair.  It leaves my hair really really soft. I have relaxed hair, BS length, and would like to make it thicker and longer, so hopefully this will work.</li>
    <li> THICKEN HAIR AND HEALTHIER SCALP.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this product...it&#x27;s very thick and my hair didn&#x27;t feel as soft as it does when i use organic morrocan oil, virgin coconut oil, or just plain vaseline...i was disappointed..i&#x27;m going to try to mix it with a conditioner for a deep conditioning treatment BEFORE i throw it out...i hope it does something miraculous when it is mixed...</li>
    <li> It was good. Little greasy. But result was so good. I recommended it. My eyebrow and eyelashes are now little bit longer than before. Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> What are the oils that can be mixed with this oil to increase the gloss and hair growth? Can I mix it with Argan oil and rosehip oil and Alavkado and grapes Please clarification</li>
    <li> You can use this oil for so many things but if you&#x27;re looking to take internally...don&#x27;t. Use the cold pressed clear castor for that. It does everything else it&#x27;s supposed to though.</li>
    <li> My hair is growing really fast</li>
    <li> To strong! Gave me headaches but kept my hair moisturized.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product but it has disapointed me. My scalp itches like crazy and is so tender to the touch. I will not be using anymore of this stuff.</li>
    <li> It moisturizes like crazy but smells horrible. At first it seems like it will be greasy but it isn&#x27;t at all. Did the job though.</li>
    <li> Had an adverse reaction to it.  I used it as a hot oil treatment as well as direct application to scalp and hairline.  Result was hair breakage.  However, when an amount of 1/4-1/2 tsp used mixed in with other oils and butters there was no breakage noted</li>
    <li> Regrew hair along the hairline, I didn&#x27;t even know hair was missing there.  Made my hair thicker. Smell is ok. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. I very dry hair and this definitely added lots of moisture. I used it as part of my hot oil treatment and i also use it around my edges. I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement on my edges just yet. I will keep this product as part of regime. It is very thick (just what my hair needs)and it smells very natural so you might want to mix other oils with it to make it smell better. I find the natural smell very bearable so its no biggie to me. I definitely recommend it if you find your hair dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months, and I have to say I love it and it&#x27;s working! It&#x27;s helping me grow my edges back (which I lost with micro braids)!</li>
    <li> Only had this product for a month , don&#x27;t see much of a change yet for my hair. I use it for the thining of hair at the crown . Will give it another month to see if any changes.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUC MY HAIR HAS GROWN LONGER AND THICKER GOT MY WHOLE FAMILY USING IT GOES VERY QUICKLY LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> I just love this stuff.  Mine and my daughters hair is very fine, gets extremely dry. tangled and knotted.  This actually helps smooth out the hair.  I don&#x27;t even need to comb it through the knots just seem to slip away whilst I stroke it through our hair and just makes the hair much more moist from the inside and stronger too.  I just can&#x27;t do without this stuff.</li>
    <li> I moisturize my hair with my regular olive and coconut oil. I then put a small amount of the JBCO. JBCO seals the hair. My hair has grown and stayed moisturized. Also, my daughter had terrible dandruff, large scales on her head. I tried EVERYTHING to get rid of it. For some reason since using JBCO the scales have disappeared. A little goes along way.</li>
    <li> The oil comes in a dark glass bottle which is perfect for so many reasons mainly to be reused.  The smell isn&#x27;t as bad as reviews I&#x27;ve read in the past.  The thickness of this oil is devine so a little goes a long way.  Mixes well with other oils to give your mix some oomph while spoiling your locks</li>
    <li> Love it! about the only oil that brings life and traps moisture into my 4c hair. My hair feels very soft after absorption and mixed in with other oils serves as the best prepoo and deep conditioner by far !</li>
    <li> this oil worked like magic from the day one of application, use it to know it what i mean.  i love it n recommend it for anyone with extreme hair loss, like i did. i mix one part of castor oil with 2  parts of coconut oil</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had long hair my whole life, but with stress from work, school, and raising a toddler, it began falling out. I heard about this product for years so I had to try it out. Not only does it grow your hair, but it makes it soft &amp; shiny. I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 months (started in April) and my hair truly has grown. Just the other day when I was visiting my fam, my sister asked if I was wearing weave lol. I was surprised when she asked that but it let me know it&#x27;s doing its job.</li>
    <li> This is a must have!!!! It has so many GREAT properties, but most of you know this already.  I used to get these occasional irritations on my scalp and when I used this castor oil (many moons ago) they would just disappear.  And after reading that castor oil can help grow eyelashes.  I would put the tiniest drop on my finger tips and rub across each eyelash. At first I just noticed them be softer and more flexible.  Now they are the longest they&#x27;ve ever been.  I&#x27;m sure u can get quicker growth from some chemical over the counter, but I love this way.. It is slow growing, but they are healthy and full and even prettier when I apply mascara.  I only apply it to my eyelashes at night after I shower, some can try more often, but this works for me.  Of course my hair loves this oil as well, I haven&#x27;t noticed the extreme thickness that most experience, but my hair&#x27;s health is a lot better with it, than without it.</li>
    <li> JBCO... An absolute must have product especially for those who are natural. it really soothes my scalp, and promotes growth</li>
    <li> Good product. Didn&#x27;t see great hair growth or anything like that but add good moisture.</li>
    <li> This Jamaican Black Castor Oil was used as a Hair Moisturizer and It was very good but it did not render and more results then any other castor oil that I can purchase from my local drug store.</li>
    <li> After my hair was severely damaged from a sew in weave I started using JBC after perming my hair. My hair growth took off. I tried some other products like carols daughter but really didn&#x27;t see any results. I use JBC 2-3 times a week after washing my hair and only applied it to my scalp. About 2-wks after perming my hair my hair started getting thicker and noticed new growth. I did use a moisturizer and sealed my ends with coconut oil but my growth only took off after using this product. Like some of the other girls I learned about JBC from You-tube. I started using it in Feb 2011 and now May 2011 I have a lot of new growth.</li>
    <li> love this when mixed with coconut or olive oil. burns my scalp a little when not diluted. can&#x27;t beat the conditioning and moisturizing benefits of this product.</li>
    <li> I add this to my every day body loiton and shea butter to make a smooth body lotion that lasts all day. It is also great as a pre-poo before washing and a sealant after adding moisture to my natural hair.</li>
    <li> Great product! It comes in two 4oz bottles and is sort of thick in texture. I believe it&#x27;s best if you just add this to products you already use, rather than using it by itself (although you can do that, too) I tried adding a scented oil to it to make it smell better and it made the product smell a lot better.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Jamaican Black Castor oil due to hair breakage problems. Before using this product. I was combing out more hair per day than I had done in a 7 day period. I could take my hands and pull out several strands each time I ran my fingers through my hair. Not anymore. I&#x27;ve got some new hair growth. I knew my hair wouldn&#x27;t have a chance to grow long and thicken up based upon the above mentioned facts. Not without some type of hair growth stimulant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase this product again. Even if my hair never grew another inch (and I hope it continually does). This Jamaican Black Castor Oil has helped keep me from going bald.  Extremely satisfied! If you&#x27;re losing lots of hair. You have nothing to lose but more hair if you don&#x27;t at least try something that may work for you. In closing. I mix the Black Jamaican Castor Oil with olive oil. I forgot to mention that I&#x27;ve been using this product (JBCO) for about 3 weeks now. Good results in such a short time.</li>
    <li> After hearing about this product all over Youtube and Hairlista.com, I began using this product some months ago, and let me tell you, JBCO works! I recently \\&quot;big chopped\\&quot; my hair(cut off all the permed ends), and began applying this oil, mixed with Emu oil to my scalp, nightly. Immediately after, I began to see my hair thicken up with a steady rate of growth. I have been using this product off and on for almost a year, and it has worked wonders for me. I normally purchase this from my local beauty supply store, but Amazon carries the larger size. This product is all natural, and all proven. Do your research and you will see for yourself. The seller shipped my product quickly and I am very happy with the service I received. Happy Hair Growing(HHG)!</li>
    <li> I think this does work.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worked as fast on me as it had on others.  But I&#x27;m still cautiously pleased.  I can say that overall my hair is softer.</li>
    <li> I really like this oil.  It&#x27;s thick and holds my braids really well without laying them down.  I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it either.  It soaks in to my scalp really well so I don&#x27;t leave oil marks all over my pillows or on my fingers.  Also, I used it as a hot oil treatment and it left my hair soft and shiny.  Plus, the smell is not bad a all. I didn&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s considered a \\&quot;healing oil.\\&quot;  I will try it on my skin and everything.  I will keep you posted.</li>
    <li> I really like it.... consistency is thick, it doesn&#x27;t smell, the container is made of glass. I will order it again, thank you so much!!!!</li>
    <li> This oil is so great to make the hair feel  smooth. I purchased it to help grow my edges. I mix it with peppermint oil and extra virgin coconut oil as a hot oil treatment.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing i notice so far is that after application, my roots are so soft.&lt;br /&gt;However, the oil is heavy and smells strong. SO it is better not to use it too often to avoid weighing the hair down&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Great Product</li>
    <li> Seems ok I&#x27;m still new to it ...but yes the smell is weird</li>
    <li> My gynecologist suggested I but this my hair is natural and wasnt in great shape  after 1st Bottle my hair has grown tremendously  My  stylist asked me if I was using what she suggested  olive oil n vitamin D  I had to tell her no &amp;  what I am using ( jamaican black castor oil ) she then told me she adds the same castor oil to the Shea butter she uses on me m other clients lol wow !!!&#x27; my hair is down my back n stronger than ever !!!!</li>
    <li> This is at least my fourth time ordering a bottle of JBCO and besides the smell, it is a perfect oil for those who have thinning hair/edges. It has helped mine thicken up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not reccommend putting it DIRECTLY on your actual hair if your hair is a thin texture because this is a very thick oil. This is more for your scalp. Depending on how big your head is, about 1-1 1/2 tablespoons of this oil is good enough for your scalp. ☺️</li>
    <li> I will be the first to say, I am thankful there is an oil with the wonderful properties and low cost of this product.&lt;br /&gt;However, IT CAUSES EXTREME SHEDDING, BREAKAGE, HARDENING OF HAIR for me.&lt;br /&gt;Take my advice, find one good product and stick with it.  The saying &amp;#34;If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it&amp;#34; applies to your hair products as well.&lt;br /&gt;Have a happy healthy hair journey.</li>
    <li> This has made a big difference in the health of my hair.  My hair was thinning and could not hold the curls.  After 6 months of using it as part of a hot oil treatment, meant hair is thicker, and bouncier.  Almost back to its normal state.  I have relaxed hair.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product but I really did not like the consistency of the product. Its very thick and has a woody smell BUT! It did what was expected. It grew my hair within about a month using it every other day. I give this product a 4 because of the thickness and smell . Overall, the product was wonderful .</li>
    <li> I purchased JBCO about two weeks ago and was really excited to give it a try.  After one week of use, I noticed my edges getting thinner so I completely discontinued its use.  I&#x27;m not disappointed that I tried, but I can say it didn&#x27;t work for me and had the adverse effect.</li>
    <li> So far, I really like it. I feel it&#x27;s working. I do see a difference. I just can&#x27;t wait to see immense growth!!</li>
    <li> i only had JBCO for a week now but has notice already the difference in the shedding, the dandruff and the texture of my hair while washing. i have really long thick hair  but i decided to purchase due to hair thinning in the center. i have been applying it directly to my scalp every other day. the smell is someone like being in a smoky bar the night b4. i will continue to use it just because it makes my hair more managable but really hope it fills in my thinning spot :) i will see if it gets 5 stars when i see my hair filling in the center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It has been 2 months since i started using it and I love it. I really can tell that it is working. My thinning hair is filling in really well. I can&#x27;t wait to give you guys a before and after once it has filled in completely :) My hair looks so healthy</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my hair</li>
    <li> A physician had alerted me to Castor oil as a helpful aid to support hair health &amp; growth.  I tried the drug store variety and it had a &#x27;tacky&#x27;, sticky feel. It coated my hair and ultimately hardened it after a few days. It worked but i didn&#x27;t care for the consistency - thick and very sticky and afterwards crusty. I feel I was just tolerating the treatments.  The JBCO was not at all like this! At first I was resistent to getting it because of other posts about it&#x27;s &#x27;bad smell&#x27; Who wants that?? But let me tell you -having used the JBCO - My hair loves it, I LOVE IT!!! The consistency is much better, it goes on GREAT!!!  I use it on hair and scalp and I am not at all adverse to the smell - really, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all.  If you are accustomed to a flower or fruity fragrance with your hair care products, you definitely won&#x27;t get that with this product but, it&#x27;s not at all like a Sulfer 8 - where it is a noticiable bad smell - it just does not have a fragrance we&#x27;ve come to expect with hair care products! Go for it - you&#x27;ll like it!!!</li>
    <li> Purchased a while ago (maybe 7months) based off of rave reviews for thinning edges. I can&#x27;t say this product is effective or not because I have not used it enough for it to have any effect. the consistency of it is so thick and the nutty smell is unbearable those are the reasons why I do not use it, it&#x27;s way too thick and sticky although it did make my edges softer I could not continue to use it. I now use Cantu sheabutter grow strong treatment on my edges and I have been seeing great results it also lays my edges down by far better than any edge control I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, I see new growth already jus ordered my second bottle.</li>
    <li> Loved it at first but then noticed a thinning of hair but plenty of length. I wanted fullness as well</li>
    <li> This product could be used so many ways. Hair, Skin could be added to Grape seed oil as well to make it thinner and then used as a lotion/oil for feet to keep them smooth and soften dry skin. It does not have a smell like standard castor oil. I dab a little under my eyes at night to keep my eyes free from wrinkles and lines. Overall good investment.</li>
    <li> Very thick, good for hair growth... The smell was awful though.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Nice nutty odor.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! I&#x27;m Caucasian and I bleach my hair. I use the jbco as a hot oil treatment and my hair feels so amazing after! It&#x27;s soft with volume and the bleached areas feel less brittle. It also helps with hair growth. I had managed to pull out a whole section of eyelashes out with eyelash curls. So, I would put a little jbco on my lash line and the spot filled out in no time!</li>
    <li> I am in love w/this stuff. I use it on my achy bones (shoulders, knees, and legs). I also use it to moisturize my skin and scalp. It makes my hair soft and its also helping my thinning spots come back in. I apply it every night before I go to bed. You dont need alot because it is very thick so a bottle will last you for a long time. I have been using this products for about 4 months now and I love this brand. Any other JBCO will not work... it has to be Tropic Isle Living and it must say Jamaican Black Castor Oil. I have given a bottle to my mother and grandmother because they have arthritis in their knees and they love it. This is definitely a healing oil for your body. If you have achy bones or thinning hair or maybe you just want something really moisturize your skin/feet, try this!</li>
    <li> Have not been really consistant with using this, but I will say the results are real!. I already see growth on my edges... As for the smell, not sure what people are talking about. I have a very sensitive nose and don&#x27;t smell a thing when using this product. A must buy for sure.</li>
    <li> This is not a bad product if you can get past the horrible smell.</li>
    <li> As a kid in Jamaica, my mom used to oil my hair with castor oil. It stunk then and it still stinks. The smell is because of the roasting of the seeds/beans. It&#x27;s expensive in Jamaica too. After college, I vowed to really take care of my hair and I started using castor oil as a pre-poo steam treatment. When I can, I buy Jamaican castor oil because it what&#x27;s I&#x27;m accustomed to. When I can&#x27;t, I use the Home Health care brand which does not smell but is slightly less effective at softening my new growth. It can be itchy on the scalp if you have sensitive skin though- any castor oil, not just this brand.  I mix this with Neem oil as a pre-poo treatment. My hair stinks temporarily but it looks great afterwards. Castor oil, multi-vitamin, weekly deep conditioning and relaxing every 12 weeks keeps my hair nice, thick and healthy.</li>
    <li> Wonderful brandand product and is amazing on my daughters hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product for adding oil to scalp; as well as assisting in hair regrowth.</li>
    <li> This oil got my beard on fleek!</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer for natural hair.  I really love this product.    It is natural and works well with my hair type.  I used to use carols daughter, but  this is far better.  It is the only thing that actually works for my 4B hair type.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok,I see some improvement..</li>
    <li> It arrived early and it appears to be working, so i am grateful that my hair is growing as a result. I was going to purchase rogaine but i&#x27;m just going to continue my use of this particular castor oil. It looks very promising.</li>
    <li> I love the results I get from Jamaican black castor oil. I felt the castor oil arrived quickly. Absolutely satisfied with this product. I love the fact that they carry this in a bigger size. The pricing was not outrageous. I will purchase this again from Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> The smell is tolerable and it is soothing. I like mixing this with my conditioners and sealing the ends of my hair.</li>
    <li> The product came fast. It was great quality. Vendor was good. five stars Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive but the seller was great.</li>
    <li> This castor oil is very sticky, there is no benefit&lt;br /&gt;In it,  i will  never  order again.</li>
    <li> I order jbc oil once before, i ran-out so i order some more  i really like it it makes my hair soft, Iam a natural but my hair is not as thick  as i want it, exspecially on top in the crown area, i heard castor oil helps to  thicken you hair, so i tryed it and it works for my edges also, my edges are coming  end nicely and slowly, but it works not as fast as i want..lol but it works and faster  than the regular kind of castor oil, i got a bigger bottle this time the 8oz size  a little goes along ways.</li>
    <li> Used to help regrow my thinning edges but didn&#x27;t notice much improvement.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product! I purchased this item after reading about it in some hair care forums and also seeing various videos on youtube talking about how it promotes hair growth. This product is great for your hair and a little goes a long way. You only need to apply it to your scalp it is way to thick to put straight on your hair. After applying massaging your scalp will work some of the oil onto you hair. This stuff really works for growth. It is hard for me to see the growth in my own hair just because new growth can be hard to keep track of when you have a full head of hair. I know it works because my boy friend has been using it also. He suffers from partial baldness where he has a big spot in the back and his hairline has the way back v shapes. He has been applying 3 times a week for 2 weeks and massaging his scalp real good after, his hair is growing back. Its not supernatural growth but there was enough that his V shape in the front has filled in enough he had to get the barber to line up the fuzz ha! His family and friends have been making comments on his hair growth everyday! The best way I think to apply is get a bowl container with a top so you can pour a little of the oil in the bottom and dip your fingers tips in. Don&#x27;t pour all your oil in the bowl because you will tend to cover your whole finger tip with oil and that is to much. If you have hair product containers that are about done wash one out and use it. It works for all races and hair types seems to me a person would only need to adjust the amounts or how often you wash depending on your hair type. Some reviews on the net are not happy about the smell, but It doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. Search the net there are some things you can add to it to kill the smell or make your own mix for what ever purpose you please! There are a lot of uses for Castor Oil. This is a must have!</li>
    <li> I use it in my hot oil treatment, as well as every other day on my scalp. It stinks, but my mother warned me about that. It smells like Chinese hot and sour soup....not such a good scent for your hair, so always make sure you have something that smells amazing on you hair shafts! Does moisturize really well though. I expect it to cut down on my hair breakage, we&#x27;ll see!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for the past 3 years, (same bottle). Yep, I slept on it for quite some time. The reason is that I tried it while I was relaxed, but it did nothing for me so I left it alone. Now that I&#x27;m 100% natural, meaning no perms, relaxers or any other chemicals are in my hair, my hair (4b) loves this product. I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is a LOT thicker, and its growing. I get better results mixing it in other oils than I would get using it alone.  I mix it in a moisturizing spritz: distilled water, aloe vera juice, jojoba oil, castor oil, neem oil, macadamia nut oil and essential oils: rosemary, tea tree, and lavender. I also mix it in my hair butters: shea, coconut oil, castor oil, olive oil, vitamin e oil, and essential oils: rosemary, lavender, french lavender, orange, clove bud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the castor oil is making the difference because I didn&#x27;t use to put castor oil in my products, but after I started to add it in, boom!! THICKER HAIR!!!</li>
    <li> My hair type: First off, I&#x27;m filipina. Strangely enough, I have the kinkiest hair in all of filipino ville. Weird rare and I finally accept it. My hair is thick and curly but thick like horse hair. More polynesian type than anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a big leap and went on the Tropic Isle website and bought their Hair Kit. It&#x27;s composed of the 8 oz bottle JBCO, Shampoo, Protein Conditioner, Hair Food and Pimento Hair growth. Actually the site sent me to one of their distributors. I only paid $50 with shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WORTH. EVERY. PENNY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not the most attentive with my hair. In fact, I&#x27;m a late bloomer. In my early 30s. In my 20&#x27;s I abused the hell out of my hair. I didn&#x27;t believe anyone (stylist) understood my hair. I was in sports, always in the sun and on the go. Ponytale was my lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried WEN. It worked pretty well but it took some time and it was slightly more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely rave over anything. But when I go to the salon and they do deep conditioning and I can feel that the product they use strips my hair. Everytime. So I just about believed that nothing would work except Wen. And I went on the hunt for recommended organic concoctions. All which takes time to put together. Unfortunately I&#x27;m a single working professional on the go. No time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I discover JBCO on Amazon. The reviews were believable and I was just so fed up with my dry hair so I went for it and bought the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh may I add I invested in the Mastex Heat Cap. The directions are on the Tropic Isle website on how to use this Hair Kit. Basically: 20-60min hot oil JBCO, Shampoo, Protein Conditioner (under Heat cap 20-60min), put on Hair food. And it recommends their JBCO pomade (and I don&#x27;t even have it.) It took me about 3 1/2 hours to do everything. I was thorough for my first time around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t seen my hair this shiny since I was in my teens and soft. Just truly impressed because there are no chemicals, it was on the first try (which goes to show you that I just needed to find the right combination for my hair) and I know I&#x27;m going to save a ton of money not having to go to the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might I add (and it was mentioned by others) JBCO is great on the skin. Also, I&#x27;ve put it on my eyelashes (use the Pimento Hair Growth). Will update if anything changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair Kit: $50&lt;br /&gt;Heat Cap: $25&lt;br /&gt;Time: 3 1/2 Hours&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful, luscious hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Priceless!ed to find the right combination for my hair) and I know I&#x27;m going to save a ton of money not having to go to the salon.

    <li> I use this on my nails and eyebrows. My nails are looking healthier and my eyebrows still are not growing yet, but its only been 2 weeks so far.</li>
    <li> OMG!!!!!! I LOVE this product! My hair is so soft, and it has started growing and thickening up ALREADY. It&#x27;s only been 2 weeks!...I will be purchasing MORE JBCO in the near future. I am about to seek more hair care products made by the JBCO people. Thank you to all my natural hair sisters for informing me of this healing product...I grease my scalp 3 times a week and add a leave-in conditioner that I made to my TWA (Teeny-Weeny Afro) and I am good to go.  Again Thank you for introducing this product...:  ALL smiles)  ****************************************************************************************************************  *******************************************UPDATE***************************************************************  ****************************************************************************************************************  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!! IT HAS BEEN A YEAR AND YES MY HAIR HAS GROWN SO MUCH! I WAS TOLD BY DEMATOLOGIST THAT MY HAIR &amp; FOLICLES WERE SO DAMAGED THAT MY HAIR WAS NOT GOING TO GROW BACK, AND GUESS WHAT I AM SITTING HERE WITH A HEAD FULL OF HAIR NOW THAT I CANT HARDLY STYLE BECAUSE IT&#x27;S SO THICK LOL!  THIS WEEK I WILL BE ORDERING MY 2ND BOTTLE OF JBCO. IT HAS BEEN 9 MONTHS AND MY VERY 1ST BOTTLE IS GONE.  I WILL KEEP EVERYONE UPDATED ON MY 2ND BOTTLE AND HOW MUCH MY HAIR GROWS. I WILL BE POSTING YOUTUBE VIDEOS VERY SOON ON MY HAIR DEVELOPMENT, NATURAL HAIR THAT IS :~D  take care!</li>
    <li> After reading the glorifying reviews and wonderful things about this product I couldn&#x27;t wait to give it a try. I was very disappointed. My scalp was always itching-until I stopped using BJC. This oil wasn&#x27;t moisturizing at all-it was just thick and greasy: very comedogenic! I don&#x27;t know what other people are talking about. I put the oil in the front area of my scalp the most-and this is the place that flaked the most. I&#x27;ve never seen so much dandruff and dry skin (flakes) build up on my scalp in my life-it&#x27;s scary! I have some of Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s products and I&#x27;m going to try the new Lisa&#x27;s Hair Elixir. Don&#x27;t take a chance on this product-use something that you know will produce the results you want.I wanted thicker &amp; moisturized hair. This product produced just the opposite.</li>
    <li> I bought this item because of my thinning edges and I think it works well. I had a ball spot and now I have peach fuse. Lol.  This product is apart of my daily routine, hot oil treatments,prepoo and I use it on my skin.. I LUVS it</li>
    <li> Though it has a strong smokey smell it does wonders for my hair. I have issues with dry ends because I get relaxers, so I bought this product to seal in moisture. This product does exactly that! It works wonders on days I want to wear my hair curly. It locks in my curls like never before!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m caucasion with long, straight, color treated hair that usually stays soft and healthy thanks to good conditioner. A few months ago, however, I tried to color my hair at home and did such a horrible job that I had to get a pro to fix it. The color was great again, but my hair was so dry and coarse that I considered cutting it all off.  After some research, I thought I&#x27;d give castor oil a try even though I couldn&#x27;t find much about using it for my hair type. I chose this brand because it seemed like good stuff. I applied it to the ends, the lengths, then massaged a little on my scalp and left it on for a few hours. Then I shampood it (took three times), conditioned it, and let it dry. It took 3 days for the stuff to get completely out of my hair but only I could tell that it was a little greasy...to others it just looked like I had product in and it didn&#x27;t rub off on my pillow.  Afterwards, my hair was back to being soft, shiny and sleek again! Now I always use this as a treatment a few days after I have my hair colored. I love it! I also use it for dry spots on my skin...I have a spot on my brow bone that gets so dry it looks flaky underneath eyeshadow and any time this flares up I just apply a tiny bit of oil for a couple days and it goes smooth and soft again. It works much better and is much cheaper than all the different expensive skin creams and hair treatments I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> Arrived in time, perfect for my hair.</li>
    <li> Great for sealing hair after moisturizing. Very think oil!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery! The castor oil is great for sealing and protecting my hair in this harsh winter cold. My ends look much better. As a natural this is added in to my regimen as a staple so now I officially have 3 staple products! The smell is off putting at first (think burnt ashes or old grease) but it dissipates after a hour or so especially if it&#x27;s mixed in with another products. I also mix it with my Herbal Essences hello hydration conditioner and no smell at all! Very satisfied with JBCO.</li>
    <li> I use this regularly in my hair and body butters.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this product great for the skin and hair, seller sent the product on time with no hassles, and was everything that I expected it to be.</li>
    <li> Have tried it only once, but it felt good.  Need more practice with it.</li>
    <li> I like the way this product makes my hair feel - soft. It soothes my scalp. I think it is helping my hair to grow. I am very pleased with the product!!</li>
    <li> Its as promoted. My hair was thin around my edgrs due to my dread locks getting heavy over the yrs and puling my hair back for was took its toll. I&#x27;ve since cut them off. Using this product is gradually help store my edges! Ive also noticed my dandruff issue has done as well, Good product.</li>
    <li> I have nothing but good things to say about the sender I got the product in a timely matter very good packing. Now as far as the product itself was not good for me I got the Jamaican Black Master Oil to see if it would help with my hair growth. I used this product for about 4 days and the morning of the 4th day I woke up with white heads all over my face mainly on my forehead. it was sooo bad I cried. when I went to the doctor he did tell me that some people can&#x27;t take the extra oil an their body react the way my body did. So I had to stop using the product. That was just my reaction to the Castor Oil.</li>
    <li> Great product.  All natural product. The delivery time (2-3 days), packaging was adequate, product was intact.  I use the castor oil for my hair (with a mixture of other products) and the results are great.  The product conceals moisture and promotes shine to your hair.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected. It make my hair feel great and keeps it moisturized for much longer.</li>
    <li> its a little heavy for my hair but I use it everyday.....I love it</li>
    <li> I like this product, my hair is softer, I just don&#x27;t see the grow yet. But the product is worthy.</li>
    <li> A great product for those of  us with thinning hair whether you apply it to the scalp once a day or twice a week. There is no rule.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the consistency of this oil at all. Smell is not great, but tolerable.  Just can&#x27;t work with this and as for putting it in my hair - a greasy, sticky mess even when used sparingly.</li>
    <li> i love my Jamaican Castor oil. i use it for everything, skin, hair etc. I just got a dermal piercing in my hands, and i mixed coconut oil and the castor oil together and rubbed it on the swelling around my piercing and it worked tremendously. i rub the castor oil on my thinning edges and i see improvement there as well!</li>
    <li> Delivery was exceptional,great job on that guys....  i don&#x27;t mind the smell which is not good and not bad either but since i just started using this product i noticed some good results.. Now i&#x27;m gonna stop here but i&#x27;ll sure post and update soon</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  For a short while her hair began looking dry and her scalp scaling.  This has never happened before and I blamed myself. I use those thick band type pull on her hair instead of the one with the balls on the end.  So I guess it pulled her hair too much, or somehow the growth slowed down.  She has always had beautiful thick, soft, medium length hair.  But washing it was a chore indeed.  This weekend I washed and blow dried in 30 minutes max!  YES- I timed it.  Washed twice, conditioned once and let sit for 5 min.  Then rinse and blow dried.  Parted hair in four and did my thing.  She didn&#x27;t cringe and we looked up and the hair was done!!!  Never before has this happened.  I am sure its because I put the castro oil on daily and rub it into her scalp. Several parents have said her hair is soft and pretty.  That&#x27;s because of the oil.  It makes it shiny and naturally curly.  Blow drying sometimes take away the natural waves, but daily castro oil usage puts it right back in.  I have started french braiding part of her hair and letting the other part breathe with normal ties.  We are both pleased and she loves the smell.  It has a \\&quot;ROBUST earthy\\&quot; smell and not at all offensive.  We will keep using this until they stop making it.... we are THAT SATISFIED.  Good product and pleased family.</li>
    <li> My skin has never been softer!! Usually, my skin drinks lotions, but when I use this product my skin stays baby soft for at least a couple of days! I highly recommend it to anyone with dry skin!!</li>
    <li> Works well for some, just not me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several month and I notice my scalp has really improved it moisturized and it seems to be helping making my hair thicker. This is a must have and I will continue to use this on my scalp. Couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better treatment. I have got others using this too.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I use it for my hair.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. I used it around my edges and on my scalp and it help my hair to start growing.</li>
    <li> Love it! I mix warm 1/2 tsp coconut oil and 1/2 tsp JBC in a hair dye bottle and run on my scalp massage and leave on for 4 hours and wash out wuth shampoo and conditioner. My hair is so smooth less frizzy and shiny! I give it 4 stars Bc the downfall is the smell to me it&#x27;s smells burnt and or like a little cogarette smokish. If that makes sense and I hate cigarette smoke. Other than the smell it&#x27;s an amazing product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Looking for shampoo and conditioner now</li>
    <li> This oil is very thick &amp; great for African -American hair texture! I love it &amp; will purchase another bottle once this runs out!</li>
    <li> Great for growing back edges and as a hot oil treatment and for sealing moisture in wet hair its great</li>
    <li> I use my Jamaican black castor oil 3 times a week.  It keeps my hair manageable &amp; easier to comb. I would recommend this product. You can use it on the go. I wish I had a squeeze top or a syringe to easily distribute to my scalp.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using Jamaican Black Castor oil. It is so much thicker than the regular castor oil. I&#x27;m not sure if my hair loves it yet....to be continued.</li>
    <li> Just started using it a few days ago.So, to early for me to write a review.</li>
    <li> Just as ordered.  Its nice and thick-ish so it doesnt run.  Works perfectly for my needs which is moisturizing hair and skin. Doesnt smell which I love.  And dont be confused by it being called Black castor Oil.  Its clear like all castor oils.  I say that because many people I have told about the oil just assumed it was dark in color.  Nope!</li>
    <li> So the smell does take some getting used to (reminds me of smoke) but if you stick it out you will have great results, I have used both this kind and the lavender scented type but feel as though the original worked better for my hair. I&#x27;ve been using JBCO since Feb 2010 via recommendations from internet sources and have found this product to work WONDERFULLY. It is quite thick (like pancake syrup without the yummy smell)  so this small bottle goes a long way. I only oil my scalp periodically because it is so heavy but I will put it on my ends from time to time. I typically use this in combination with coconut oil and have found the two to be very effective, it has \\&quot;changed\\&quot; the texture of my hair meaning it just enhanced what was there all along. Now I can stretch my relaxers longer and going natural is becoming more of a viable option for me. Either type of hair can benefit and flourish just keeping a healthy routine is key. This product worked great for me but as we all know what works for one may not for another, but give it a chance! Good luck :)</li>
    <li> I wear dreadlocks and this product is extremely moisturizing for my hair.  Love it! I highly recommend this product to other women of color.  It&#x27;s not too greasy and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Product really didn&#x27;t help with growing back my edges, but works great as a sealant</li>
    <li> This is really a great product for the scalp and it stimulates hair growth.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Great for hair and skin, I use it for my hair and skin to combat dryness although it help to bring my hair back to a healthy state. great for chemically treated hair,dry and brittleness.</li>
    <li> I got this because my friend recommended it for me. I have very thin and short edges and she said that this stuff would help grow my hair out. I decided to buy it and mix it with avocado oil (her suggestion as well) because this oil is very thick. My sister puts the concoction in my hair every other day. I&#x27;ve been using it for quite some time and even though my sister says that my hair in the back has gotten longer, I don&#x27;t see any results with my edges. Maybe I should be using it more often? I&#x27;m not sure. I&#x27;m not going to give up on it, though. I&#x27;ll keep using it and see what happens :)</li>
    <li> This is actually my second time purchasing this product. So you know what that means!!! Not only do I love it, but my mom does as well. Made my hair grow, edges finally start to come in and im loving the results. Keep my hair soft and less brittle.</li>
    <li> This definitely thickened my hair and made my roots stronger with less breakage. I saw a difference around 2 weeks. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for almost one month and still seeing progress in thinning areas. My sides are not significantly different but I&#x27;m going to remain faithful to using it until I see progress. Overall, it has thickened other parts of my hair.</li>
    <li> this stuff works! i&#x27;ve had it for a month and so far i see some growth! the smell is ok, not the best, but i added lavender oil to mine and it helped masked the smell..its nothing too overwhelming!</li>
    <li> PERFECCCCCT! just what i was looking for to start my oil treatments. It&#x27;s safe for both hair and eyelashes. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> Made my hairline and forehead break out with bumps</li>
    <li> It has a strong scent but it works. I eventually mixed it with coconut oil to help with the scent. My little girl hair grew quickly within two months she no longer had thinning hair or bald spots.</li>
    <li> Loving this hair product it has made my hair thick and healthy I have no complaints here didn&#x27;t take too long to receive it would recomend this oil to anyone who needs thick hair for any type hair relaxed or natural I&#x27;m natural...that&#x27;s all</li>
    <li> It makes your scalp itchy</li>
    <li> I have AA hair that is natural, course, wavy in some areas/kinky in others, super dry/brittle and fragile.  Nothing seems to deeply moisturize my hair like castor oil.  I also use it to lightly oil my scalp a few times a week.  I used to use regular castor oil many years ago and can&#x27;t recall why I stopped using it. All castor oil is really heavy, so folks need to keep that in mind.  I don&#x27;t find that this castor oil smells significantly stronger than regular castor oil.  I&#x27;ve gotten used to the smell, and no one close to me and has commented that my hair stinks.  lol! I highly recommend this to ppl w/really dry, course hair!</li>
    <li> It works and mixed well with coconut oil. Perfect for dry skin also. Well worth the price.this is a big bottle.  I love getting,my monies worth.</li>
    <li> I love the thick consistency and the sweet aroma, very soft on my hair and my 8mouth old daughter, helps with the growth on her sides and make her hair very shiny. this will last long if used generously, its thick enough to stretch.</li>
    <li> THIS product was purchased for my hair but it didn&#x27;t do anything but kept it greasy. So I use it as a body oil.</li>
    <li> While I don&#x27;t doubt that this is a great product, I found it to be to strong smelling and to heavy for any use for me.</li>
    <li> The products is exactly what I expected. I use it like once a week on my scalp. Thanks you for the product.</li>
    <li> I was concerned because everyone said the oil smelled bad, I didn&#x27;t want to go around smelling terrible MY THOUGHT was similar to sulfur 8.  But don&#x27;t worry it smells nothing like sufur 8 what you do smell is  a light smokey ash smell which goes away shortly after you put in your hair or on your skin.  I have natural hair and my hair is very thick so the new growth sometime is hard to manage.  But since using this product even my new growth is manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it and see for yourself.....</li>
    <li> I use this oil in my hair, on my skin, scars etc. This is a great oil.   I resently got a nose piercing &amp; a tattoo, and this castor oil helped so much in the healing process.It was amazing, compare to other castor oils that i&#x27;ve used. Sometimes I put some on my face at night before going to bed, in my hair(makes it so soft). I even mix a few drops in my homemade lotions(made with sheabutter). Can&#x27;t say enough about It.  my friends and family are now hooked.</li>
    <li> I love castor oil. To give it a nice fragrance, I mix with coconut oil. I use it for my hair AND skin. Wonderful!!</li>
    <li> My hair is in transition from relaxers and I bought this to stop it from shedding and it has and I massage it in my hairline because it is thin,My hair is soft when I use a scarf over night with the oil in my hair so I will continue to use it</li>
    <li> One word for this product is \\&quot;AWESOME\\&quot;. I read many reveiws &amp; I finally decided to give this product a try. I must say \\&quot;A Little Goes A Long Way\\&quot; ... Jamaican Black Castor Oil (JBCO) worked miracles on my  scalp. My scalp was sooooo dry no matter what oil or hair products I used. But, with JBCO got rid of that problem the 1st week of use. Also, my scalp burned sooo bad when I got my hair relaxed. Now, I have no scalp irradiations. Everyone needs to give this product a try. Plus, it was shipped to me sooooo fast!!!! Love it Love it Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I got this product after doine extensive research over the internet. i was a bit skeptical because there were some good and bad reviews on this product. i used it maybe twice a week for 4 weeks combined with biotin pills that i purchased from another place. i only washes it out once, i know...shame on me. but, my hair grew an inch, my hair is sooooo stubborn, that inch was the best thing that ever happened to me...lol...but yeah, this stuff works...it might smell funny, but its well worth it :)</li>
    <li> all though i found out im allergic to the jbco, i still like the effect it has on my hair, mixed it with rosemary oil (to cover up the smell of the castor oil) add the 2 to my conditioners and deep conditioners also hair moisture lotions. Also made a massage oil using jbco,rosemary and some other oils that i use on my scalp twice a week to help with hair growth and strengthening.</li>
    <li> Got it pretty fast I bought it for my hair (tryna grow back my crown and some spots in the front I usually nix it with other things because I myself personal dont think JBCO works by it self for me on the hair. But on the face to clear up pimples and news scars/fresh it does WONDERS. I LOVE IT FOR MY FACE.</li>
    <li> Has helped me with Ulcerative Colitis.  My hair is always falling out with this disease and this helps</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting. This Isn&#x27;t the black oil it&#x27;s more like regular Castro oil. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Because this brand of castro oil is natural. It is not harmful and helps the human skin in many ways.</li>
    <li> Plain and straight...if you use this product with some continuity, your hair will grow. I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months now. I put a little in every night and my hair has gotten thicker in the center, filled in on the sides, and the texture is softer. Surprisingly, my hair isn&#x27;t slick and greasy in the morning and the product doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant scent. A winner!</li>
    <li> I would like to know is this product is real I do not see all the fuss about this product waste ot money.</li>
    <li> Finally gonna order a second batch soon. His baby lasted a long time.</li>
    <li> Started using this product after I took braids out a month ago. My edges were thinning and my hair was dry. After only a month my edges are growing in, my hair stays moisturized and my 4b curls are much healthier. I also use this product under Eco Styler gel to keep my hair from getting too hard and crunchy. Works so much better than regular castor oil.</li>
    <li> Alittle definately goes a long way, I have fine 4a hair, I find this to be a great product for the winter months because its so thick, and seals hair from the drying cold and my dry house,But I&#x27;m not sure if i would use for the summer. It does have a burnt nuts kind of a smell, but its not a strong odor at all. It washes out well with no build up.Also If you suffer from dry cracked winter skin this is WAY better than lotions that only seem to help temporarily.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It smells alittle wierd but good wierd. The oil is thick and works good on hair. I ways get compliments on my hair of how soft it is and how conditioned it looks! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased Jamaican Black Castor oil for the growth properties. I was not disappointed.  I like the way it has made my hair seem thicker, and moisturized. I was having hairloss and breakage, and by using JBCO in my hair 3 times a day, it seems to have slowed down the breakage..</li>
    <li> First of all this product is usually sold in a glass bottle, mine came in a plastic bottle which leads me to believe that this produce did not come from the manufacturer advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Second this product made my scalp and hair line itch like crazy which in turn caused red scaly welts to form all over.&lt;br /&gt;Third the oil is so thick that it is hard to wash out completely after applying. I would suggest, to those with acne prone skin to wear something to cover your head while sleeping to contain the oil and stop it from spreading to your pillow and face. My skin broke out like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this product just didn&#x27;t work for me but I will never ever purchase this product ever again. I can&#x27;t say that I won&#x27;t recommend it because I dont know how it will affect others.</li>
    <li> Thick smoky smell , don&#x27;t know if it works</li>
    <li> I bought this because i read great reviews about how it can thicken thin hair. However, the oil is extremely thick. I felt as if my hair was falling and getting damaged due to the viscosity of the product. The product also has a pungent smell. For those looking for a remedy to thin hair, try minoxidil. You can buy the generic products from a local target or walmart.</li>
    <li> This really grew out my edges. I have always just had thin ones, but I read reviews that claimed this helped, and they were telling the truth! I now have full edges. The smell isn&#x27;t great, but it works! I also use it for my braids. When I take them out, my hair is so moisturized. I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been  using this on my lashes for about a  month now and already see a  big difference. LOVE  this  product and  highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Very good texture so you can tell right off the back that it is 100% castor oil, i&#x27;ve had very thin hair for as long as I can remember and this castor oil has helped dramatically. Not only are my strands stronger but I&#x27;ve also seen evident signs of growth! I&#x27;m really satisfied with this product as a whole and the shipping was ridiculously fast.&lt;br /&gt;It came in less than a week! very impressed.</li>
    <li> Thick and slick my edges down nicely</li>
    <li> I am not really sure how to use this product.  I purchased for hair since I was transitioning from relaxed to natural.  It made my hair feel hard and sticky.  It may be me and my lack of knowledge (although, I did YouTube usage).  I wear my fine hair short and straight after the BC and I prefer soft and touchable hair.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff my hair has grown. I&#x27;m Hispanic but I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair unfortunately , product arrived quickly and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase thanks for the awesome service will order when this one runs out! Thanks</li>
    <li> Authentic Jamaican black castor oil.  My grandmother use to make this when I was growing up in Jamaica.  Smells the same, looks the same and does the same great job.  I purchased mine in December and it is now almost March.  I still have 3/4 of the 8oz bottle left.  A little goes a long way. I will be coming back for more.</li>
    <li> I have seen some New hair Growth where it was balding hope the hair grows to cover my bold patch soon before my daughters wedding in July.</li>
    <li> I am using the product for my hair just started. So far i like how soft it makes my hair. So, so far so good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I decided to try JBCO. I read the previous reviews and although positive I was still skeptical. I&#x27;ve tried numerous products in the past that have that gimic &amp;#34;if you&#x27;re not 100% satisfied we&#x27;ll refund your money.&amp;#34; Needless to say I&#x27;ve tried them all and none have come close to what JBCO has done. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months now, apply morning and before bed. My sides are of primary concern for hair loss so that&#x27;s where I&#x27;ve focused application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say I see significant growth in an area that use to be completely bald. Yes I was guilty of subjecting my sides to years of micronbraiding. Well I&#x27;m going to continue using and can&#x27;t wait to see how much growth is&lt;br /&gt;present over the next two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS the only con I can say is the smell. It reeks of earthy, woods. I took the advice of another reviewer and combined the oil with another cream hairdress soley to mask the earthy smell. It worked!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PSS if some are wondering why I haven&#x27;t used the product all over my scalp, it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m wearing a sew-in as a protective style so my scalp isn&#x27;t accessible.  Once I take the remove the weave I will be applying JBCO all over. Who knows, this time next year my goal&lt;br /&gt;is to wear my hair!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results with this product. I&#x27;ve read that women would put this on their eyelashes. I applied it once one night before bed and the following day I was sent home from work. I think the oil got into my eyes and irritated it. I remember my eyes being swollen and one of my eyes was swollen shut. Tears kept following from both my eyes and I&#x27;ve went slightly blind. It was tender to the touch and no matter how often I washed my eyes in the morning, it still didn&#x27;t improve anything.&lt;br /&gt;I went to the Eye doctor and the doctor couldn&#x27;t do anything for me. I didn&#x27;t want to go to ER as I didn&#x27;t have any medical insurance. My last resort was to self-treat whatever was going on with me. I took a couple of Benadryl, and 5 hours later I woke up from a long nap and I could see that the swelling went down. I took more Benadryl at bedtime and woke up the following morning feeling much better. I was able to go back to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the product since that last incident with my eyelashes. I guess I&#x27;m allergic to the oil. So I won&#x27;t be using it anymore.</li>
    <li> Great texture like syrup. Works wonders on my hair (:</li>
    <li> Great product.  Took a few days to deliver, but I am sure it had something to do with the glass container.  Other than that, product came as promised and so far great product for the money.</li>
    <li> after watching some youtube videos and reading on the internet about the oil, i decide to buy it. the oil smells really bad and did not work at all. i actually notice my hair starting to thin the more i use the oil. i mix it with cantu leave in conditioner and i still had more thinning in my hair. its hard to keep the oil from dripping all over your face. if you started to sweat, it made your hair smell like garbage.</li>
    <li> I love this Jamaican black castor oil!  I just added a few drops to a few other essential oils in a spray bottle with some water to use as a daily moisturizer/ conditioner.  It&#x27;s has helped tremendously with breakage I was getting as a result of dry hair. My natural hairline has really gotten thicker in the past month!  The Jamaican black castor oil is thick but not sticky. It coats the hair well. I just love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product it has grown my hair tremendously. I would recommend this product to everyone that I know thanks Amazon. The price is reasonable too. The product is also very effective.</li>
    <li> I have type 4a/b hair meaning that it is very course and I feel the Jamaican black castor oil makes my hair very soft and manageable. I also think it is thickening up my hair. Its a great product.</li>
    <li> I am a true believer in JBCO from Tropical Isle. My edges were nearly gone in May of this year (I wish I could post before and after pics). It is now August and my hair is back. I mix it with coconut oil (this will eliminate itching) but you can mix it with any oil you prefer but you will have itching if you don&#x27;t mix it with another oil. I apply it to my scalp and I add it to my conditioner. I was skeptical at first but now I can truly say it does work. I have ordered multiple bottles because my daughters (ages 14 thru 1) all use it. It works and it is safe for kids, it doesn&#x27;t get any better. I wish I could tell more people to try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed. I am an African American woman with relaxed hair and 2 of my daughters have natural hair. This is safe for relaxed and natural hair.--Mrs. Mckinlia Laphand</li>
    <li> I can tell after a week that my hair has grow in some areas....this product is different from any oil I have ever used before very thick consistency. I feel I will have this bottle for a while because it only takes a small amount to do its job. Loving it!!!!</li>
    <li> Just received it 2 days ago so it&#x27;s to soon to evaluate. Product has a nice feel to it. Can&#x27;t wait to see results.</li>
    <li> I liked the way it helped to regrow my hairline but the smell is not pleasant. I&#x27;m going to try putting some essential oil in the bottle next time.  But for me the product seemed to help thicken my hairline.</li>
    <li> Product arrived without a label i didn&#x27;t know what was in the bottle i email the company and they sent me out a labeled bottle of jbco. Anyway, JBCO smells like smoke and very heavy.</li>
    <li> After abusing my hair with perms, dye and glued-in weave, I decided to grow my OWN hair out. I&#x27;ve always felt that as long as there was weave in this world, I could always have long hair. Lol. But there&#x27;s nothing like your OWN hair as a black female. So I purchased this product after my hair stylist used it on her edges. This product is AMAZING. I have very fine hair and it is relatively thin (which Im sure has a lot to do with the heat, perms and glue over the past two years). Over the past 5 months, my hair has DRAMATICALLY increased in thickness and moisture. I do not use black product shampoo because it knots my hair for some reason, but after I wash my hair and straighten it, I part it, and use JBCO. I massage it in my head once a day and also take a daily vitamin e pill. It has truly brought my hair back!</li>
    <li> I use this almost everyday to keep my scalp oil..the more i use it the thicker&lt;br /&gt;my hair get&#x27;s .the product works very well.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY oil or product that has moisturized and softened my dry and brittle natural type 4b/4c hair. I have tried shea butter, mango butter, olive oil, various curl milks/creams. NOTHING I mean NOTHING moisturizes my hair like this castor oil. I thought that I would just have to deal with my dry brittle ends but JBCO has been my saving grace. My hair is soft and manageable my curls are defined not frizzy like before. One draw back, like I have seen with other reviewers, my scalp is irritated by this product so I use it to seal my ends or do a hot oil treatment, both of which nourishes my hair but keeps the product away from my scalp. Also it smells like grill or stove smoke so you may want to add it to leave in conditioner or essential oils. Overall I still give it 5 stars due to its miracle ability to moisturize and soften my hair, I wish I would have known about this years ago!</li>
    <li> Order came today with the bottle shattered nothing to do but throw it in the trash disappointed couldn&#x27;t even save the paper to return</li>
    <li> I love this castor oil for my fine relaxed hair. My nape was really weak and damaged from a relaxer that wasn&#x27;t washed out properly. I ordered this oil and started applying this oil on my scalp 3 days a week. Let me tell you, in less than a month, my hair had that \\&quot;swang\\&quot;. I was so happy. Now this oil is a staple of mine. I also poured some in my deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> Amazing. my hair was breaking and wouldn&#x27;t even be shoulder length because it keeps breaking. i used the oil on my scalp and hair, cornrowed my hair, didnt retouch my hair for 6 months. The result; nice, thick, past shoulder length hair, less less less breakage. Right now im just going 2 perm my hair twice a year. my next perm will be in november - in 6 months. in the meantime im leaving my hair out for a month and a half, then do african princess hair style for 4 months- will treat my hair every month. will post again to share my hair length.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell of it but it&#x27;s great for my hair.</li>
    <li> A must buy for all Naturals! Do your hair a favor and add this to your list of products. It is a wonderful scalp conditioner, keeps dandruff at bay, and your hair WILL grow! I had a time with my edges and after adding this to my routine, they came back and my entire head of hair is thicker! Just try it, I promise that you will not be disappointed with the results. Mix it with your lotion as well for crazy moisture.</li>
    <li> I love this oil for my natural hair</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I mean I was skeptical of using it but after reading reviews on the internet i decided to give it a try. I put it on me and my daughter&#x27;s hair and it works so good. I have relaxed hair so it weighs it down unless i mix it with coconut oil, jojoba or olive oil. I am transitioning from relaxed to natural hair because its a preference of mine to wear my hair that way and embrace my natural curls. It works wonders and it&#x27;s so amazing on hair especially on natural hair since my daughter has natural hair and the castor oil is absorbed so well. I mix mine with coconut oil and add a little tea tree oil with rose hip oil. On and off I do switch from coconut oil to olive oil which i realized has a slight different texture. It&#x27;s the best thing that ever happened to my hair. People try it, you wouldn&#x27;t regret it. The JBCO to me was absorbed much better in skin than the clear castor oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a member of Hairlista.com which is where I first heard about this product, just as Sunshyne(website creator/black hair expert) said to I added the JBCO to my conditioners as well as making it my primary scalp oil. It also works well as a sealant, if you don&#x27;t wanna waste it you can use it only to seal your ends. Upon every relaxer I noticed my hair really getting thicker not visible thickness but I could feel more hair when I went make a ponytail and I knew this kind of thickness isn&#x27;t something I would have a achieved without my JBCO. But just recently, no that I&#x27;m a three month user I&#x27;m starting to really see visible thickness, it makes me excited and motivates me too keep using this product and stay faithful in my hair journey so that my hair will be as long, thick and beautiful as the woman on hairliscious.com :)</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff. The smell is a little weird but its a good product. Also EXTREMELY THICK! I recommend diluting it with another type of oil ESP if your using it for hair or skin.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical as always when trying something new but I prefer to try products that are natural. I am african-american with natural 4B hair. My hairline was thinning due having my hair bleached &amp; then dyed in July and the thinning was very noticeable. I bought this product &amp; within in three weeks my hairline is growing back in beautifully. I can&#x27;t speak for others but it has worked for me. Usually I wash/condition my hair and then oil my entire scalp with the castor oil. It is very thick &amp; a little goes a long way. On my wash day I wear a plastic bag on my head over night to seal the moisture in (otherwise known as the greenhouse effect). Then I usually just put the castor oil around my thinning hair line daily. Funny thing is I have what I consider an unusual hairline where it dips back near my right/left temples and hair has started to grow in that area as well! I have never put the castor oil all over my hair b/c I dont see the need to do that. As for the scent, I personally dont mind the scent &amp; I have a very sensitive nose. It does have the scent of ashes however I also use another moisturizer on my actual hair that has the scent of fresh baked pound cake/cookies and all I ever smell is that. If you have ever used shea butter, jojoba oil, etc you probably wont mind the scent of the castor oil. Overall I am pleased with the product and will continue to use this product even when my hairline has grown all the way in. As with all products I believe that no one product produces a miracle and you must be patient and have a regimn. I wanted my hairline to grow back so I am being very deligent about how I use the product. :)</li>
    <li> I love this oil, grew up with it in haiti, except its just castor oil but its the same way they make it. i tried the american castor oil, you know the clear ones, i don&#x27;t get it, it smells nothing like this, not sure how they make theirs. Maybe its in my head but its not the same. The shipping was on time, i took one sniff and it took me home, that nasty smell. We use it on our hair (it softens the hair so wanderfully, just spray some water on the hair and add some castor oil, it makes it more manageable) and it softens the skin. you can also drink it mixing it with some orange juice for a cleansing, but know that it is disgusting. All in all i love my black castor oil.</li>
    <li> Best oil in the world!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing my edges are growing  back fast im going natural this product is amazing works well for me</li>
    <li> This product is great for my hair being a 4b/4c natural gal. It really helps to hold moisture in and keep my hair soft. I think it&#x27;s also clearing my skin a little too. Glad I bought this. It lasts long and I will be buying again! A real treat![[ASIN:B003CTTZQQ Jamaican Black Castor Oil 8oz]]</li>
    <li> I regularly use castor oil for both akin and hair care, so when I saw this product on Amazon, I was very excited. Castor oil, but better, less processed, I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being that this product is marketed as &#x27;black castor oil&#x27;, I was expecting an oil that is substantially thicker than regular castor oil and very dark. It&#x27;s neither. It&#x27;s got the same viscosity as regular castor oil and is far from &#x27;black&#x27;. Is it a good product? As I have extensive experience using castor oil, I expect it to be pretty much the same. However, we will see if it works any better over the next couple of months. I&#x27;ve got fairly fine &#x27;white girl&#x27; hair with a dry scalp. I&#x27;ve found that castor oil keeps my hair in much better condition that it normally would be in and keeps my scalp normal &amp; flake free. The best thing I&#x27;ve found to do with castor oil is to massage it into my scalp and saturate my hair with it. I leave it in overnight, roll it up in a bun and hold it in place with the Goody twist pins. The next day I wash it out with sulfate free shampoo and condition with Ion conditioner. I will continue to do this with this product and see if it works any better than the castor oil I buy from my supplier which is totally clear with no color to it. This one is slightly tan in color, but still clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packing of the product is great. The bottle itself is dark glass, which protects the oil from light. Very important, so I was happy to see this. The labeling is clear and easy to read.</li>
    <li> love it need some more</li>
    <li> I received the product in a timely manner  It works well on my skin and hair.  This is my 2nd purchase.</li>
    <li> It smell like cigerettes very strong cigerette smoke and it made my head itch tremendously and my scalp had a lot of sore spots on it from using it. I thimk this product is made out of tar and nicotine yuck my scalp didnt appreciate me putting liqified cigerette ashes on it.... I gave it two stars instead of one because it makes the hair soft but thr scalp irritation is crazy back to pure cooking olive oil on my hair!!</li>
    <li> I have been using JBCO for the past week and my hair loves it. I use it twice a day everyday. My hair is soft and moisturized. I already seeing new growth. I will be a customer for life .</li>
    <li> This product  is amazing</li>
    <li> Love this products. Makes hair feel soft and helps promote hair growth. But be patient. Hair takes time to grow.</li>
    <li> My hair is becoming healthy less breakage..and growing . I totally love it on second bottle. Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow</li>
    <li> So for it has done wat I knw  it is good for and and does the job well. It arrived earlier an expected and the price was good</li>
    <li> Havent had problems with my edges ever since I started using this product</li>
    <li> This is a great product because it&#x27;s one of the rear oils that I know of that nourishes and moisturizes hair!</li>
    <li> HAVEN&#x27;T USE MUCH OF IT, BUT I LIKE IT ..THANK&#x27;S</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a month and it has worked wonders on my thinning edges. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m from an Island and this just smell like burned oil. No difference in my skin. It smells horrible. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> It rejuvenated my hair after being in braids for 2 months and also helped me regain a lot of lost hair. My edges have also been repaired and gradually getting to the normal length of my hair.</li>
    <li> I have dreadlocks and I love putting this on my scalp.  It is very soothing and is not damaging to my natural hair.</li>
    <li> I used this JBCO for my Deep Conditioner&#x27;s and scalp massages. I lot of people love to use this oil for their scalps but I had to stop because it would make me itch. It&#x27;s still a very good product.</li>
    <li> I had heard so many good things about it and finally joined the hype and ordered. This is a great product, at first I was so dissapointed as it was my first time of ever using such a viscous-type oil on my hair. I overused it then got the \\&quot;proper\\&quot; way to do it and its been great so far. I&#x27;m natural so I use it for my twists. Def noticed significant thickness when I followed up with a twistout or wash day. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> This product(Jamaican black castor oil)is really good for hair.I bought this item last month since then I have been using it once a week.I have already noticed some hair growth,and also hair becomes soft,shiny and looks healthy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s oil, I don&#x27;t like the smell of it, but I just start using it, after 3 months, I will check back in :-\</li>
    <li> My hair feels thicker since using this product.It is a bit thick to be honest.I put my JBCO in conditioners and moisturizers.I hope to have my hair really full.</li>
    <li> I received my order very quickly. I have only just begun to use it but I love how soft and shiny it makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> I am a new user I think it takes more time to make a decision, but so far It is ok. Hair is staying moisturized, but I cant measure any growth yet.</li>
    <li> Execellent product along with the hair food it makes a great team</li>
    <li> I bought this over a week ago. It&#x27;s a multipurpose castor oil. I used it for constipation. It works better than the one at walgreens. Also, I use it after I wash my hair to keep scalp moisturized. Just a little will do not to much to scalp it will feel rather heavy. I notice a difference when styling my hair on a day to day basis its more shiney and looks a whole lot better the nthe optium oil that I use to use. Also I but a dime size on my feet after my pedicure. Makes them look renewed and that fresh pedicure look.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product; I have ordered it 3 times now. I don&#x27;t have to wait long for it to arrive and I like that!</li>
    <li> This product is a miracle. My hair line is growing back and I am feeling good about my locks once more.</li>
    <li> I purchased this castor oil for myself, and I also use it on my 3 1/2 yr. old daughter.  It is a little thick, but I don&#x27;t mind it, I just rub some on my edges every night before bed.  I mix it with my daughter&#x27;s hair products, and I am seeing excellent results for both myself and my daughter.  I will definitely recommend and use this product again!!</li>
    <li> It came before the date that they said it would come so that was really Good. The bottle was bigger than I expected so that was good as well. This product gets a thumbs up from me. I haven&#x27;t used it yet but it looks like it&#x27;s going to last me a whole year if not even more.</li>
    <li> excellent product so thick and natural.  I use it on my skin, hair and as an ingredient when I am experimenting with other essential oil mixes. I&#x27;ve already seen and experiencing thick hair and it is growing less than two full weeks!</li>
    <li> AS An African American woman with damaged hair it is a god sent. It real seems to keep moisture in my hair which in turn will lead to me being able to retain length. now don&#x27;t go on thinking this will cure every hair problem like any product you have to be consistent and use it regularly. When combined with a moisturizer and a lil water you&#x27;re talking about nice soft feeling hair. I&#x27;ve only been using about a weak but I kid you not my hair is starting to feel slightly thicker and more moisturized. I have kinky 4a/4b hair and often in the winter it&#x27;s hard to maintain moisture we&#x27;ll not anymore. It comes in a dark job and was bagged excellently to prevent damage. While it may seem like a small size bottle, a little goes a long way. It has the consistent of a syrup or molasses so don&#x27;t go crazy like you would with a lighter oil you&#x27;ll end up with some seriously greasy hair. Also, do not be alarmed by the smell it&#x27;s kinda smoky smelling almost smells like nuts being roasted in the oven once you put a moisturizer and water on it the smell disappears immediately. I use this every night and morning. It can also be used as a hot oil treatment.  I&#x27;m really hoping that this product can grow my hair out because it grows very slowly and is kinda damaged. I think this will now become a staple in my regimen I would highly recommend for most naturals. Updates to come :)</li>
    <li> shipping was very fast only two days. what I recieved was not jbco or was mixed with something the smell was awful rancid smelling. the consistency thin and the color more clear than anything. I have used this brand before brought at my local beauty supply store and I was satisfied. I still had a little left in the other bottle so I compared the two to make sure I wasn&#x27;t crazy. yeap as I thought not what I wanted. I will just discard this bottle cause its too much a hassle return it. I bought this for my hair but scared to use it. and it smell too bad to use it anywhere else</li>
    <li> I tried JBCO because of the hype and I&#x27;ve used other brands of castor oil before that really made my hair feel strong and soft. For one week I oiled my scalp every other night and I experience so much shedding. Maybe it&#x27;s the way I used it, maybe it just isn&#x27;t for me, but it made me shed so bad and I&#x27;m afraid I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to see any positive results. Obviously it works for some people, so you can always try it and see what it does for you. I&#x27;ll prob try it again using a different method in a few months. Good Luck!</li>
    <li> I truly believe that the Jamaican black castor oil has thicken my hair it also is growing a little and yes i&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about Jamaican black castor oil. I Hv been using it every other day. One of my girlfriends said to me. Your hair is growing like wildflowers all over. It&#x27;s like it happen over night. The smell is something I had to get use too.</li>
    <li> Yes, it is great. It is thicker than I thought but makes my hair soft.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Great price</li>
    <li> Most natural kinky curly girls already understand the important benefits we get from essential oils. Jamaican Black Castor Oil helps curls to flourish! I usually mix it with other oils like coconut and or jojoba. At the beginning of my hair journey, after the big chop, I massaged it straight into those thinning and more needy areas. Now you would never know they existed! These are thin spots I had for years and thought that&#x27;s just how it was. Nope! I am now 45 with a head full of mop top curls that I love. And for my sisters without curls, Use it as an over night treatment or a massage for your scalp and then wash it out, I think you will be pleased. But for my kinky curly sisters leave it in until you wash. I use it on my washed wet hair first and let my hair air dry. And then after that as much as I like between washes. You can decide whats best for your own hair type. Good luck!</li>
    <li> It spelled magic on my hair :) My hair was becoming dry after coming to US and after applying this oil my scalp became healthier and hair-fall decreased considerably. Wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;Thnx!</li>
    <li> No complaints from my wife, and buying from Amazon is so easy and so cheap.</li>
    <li> Love this castor oil. It&#x27;s heavy,but so good. I use this product with Mega-tek as a  leave in conditioner , and  my hair has improved greatly.  I have dry hair because of dry blowing and flat iron, and the combination of these products has improved the texture as well as manageability.  My hair doesn&#x27;t look dry or brittle and my ends look healthy.  I use it twice a week and I also use Mega-Tek as a deep conditioner and rinse it out. Next, I blow dry my hair and style it, then I apply to my scalp the castor oil with Mega-Tek.  It smells like nutty when you use Jamaican Black Castor Oil with Mega-Tek.</li>
    <li> This Castor oil makes my 4c/4b hair very soft and has grew back my thinning edges! Great stuff! I brought the 8oz and it has lasted me a very long time. A little goes a long way. I received my bottle in November 2011 and I still have half a bottle left!</li>
    <li> im a guy this stuff makes my face and hair look really healthy and not shiny. i feel like i glow with it. i just put a small amount into my hand and rub my hands until they are warm and spead it on. i have real short hair. it does make my mustache and go tee look nicer too.</li>
    <li> Works great! I can see my hair line is getting fuller and my hair is growing faster.</li>
    <li> I really have not noticed a difference in my edges which is why I brought it but I did notice more hair growth as far as the length.</li>
    <li> Like it very much, can see approvement in the growth and texture of my hair. It is very thick and will last a very long time.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B003CTTZQQ Jamaican Black Castor Oil 8 Oz]]I love my jbco. My hair is thicker n growing nicely. The shipping was very fast. I received it before the estimated delivery date. The smelldoes bother me but as long as I use as little as possible then its not noticable. When I first applied it I was using an applicator bottle n putting way too much on. I went to bed wondering why I kept smelling cigarettes. Once I figured out it was the oil I decreased the amount I applied and that solved the problem.</li>
    <li> the best stuff i ever used in the winter for my hair and skin. if you don&#x27;t know about this stuff you should learn I&#x27;m always getting compliments on my skin . well i keep it moisturized with natural oils year round that&#x27;s it that&#x27;s all and a healthy diet of coarse but this stuff is great for the whole family!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> YAAAY! great product! Love it! Great buy! I am a VERY happy customer! I will order again for sure! yes</li>
    <li> I recieved a relaxer that had the back of my hair looking like I got a taper. I then decided to go natural so I went to the popular sewin, only to have my edges become extinct. I did some research and heard ALOT of great things about JBCO. I went natural and ordered some and OMG does this stuff work for my 4a/b hair!!!! At first it made the bald patches really thick, then the hair grew like you wouldn&#x27;t believe now it has length and thickness like the rest of my hair and you would never be able to tell I had any previous damage!</li>
    <li> I cannot say if it really works yet because I have yet to see any results. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks or so. I have noticed that my hair is shedding tremendously and I&#x27;m not happy about that.</li>
    <li> I bought it to help thicken up my edges and within 3 weeks I noticed a big difference. I&#x27;ve also used it on my grandson&#x27;s dry skin and it has helped a lot.</li>
    <li> i love this for my hair.. its rich and creamy. i leave it in my hair all day then wash it out.</li>
    <li> Since i have been using this product i have seen quite abit of changes in my edges, i had a bald spot and it has grown back in, the rest of my edge is still short but has thickened up quite abit. However i have only been using it for about 3wks so i hope to see alot more growth with time</li>
    <li> great for growing and thickening natural hair... especially thinning edges on African American hair... I will keep this in stock at my house...</li>
    <li> I have natural hair and was in search of a moisturizer for my dry hair.  This works well.  I use it often.</li>
    <li> I so far  am pleased.My hair was dry and brittle. It has moisture back into hair from all the abuse my hair took. It is breaking far less.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product yet. So my review is on the service itself which is awesome. I order this item about 3 days ago and it came today via standard shipping. As for the product the smell is fine and it&#x27;s thick but not too thick. (so a little goes a long way) Thanks Mike you are....Awesome!</li>
    <li> I live by this stuff! It works!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil for four months now. I have very fine 4 type kinky natural hair. My hair is so fine and soft to a point that I have never enjoyed growing out my natural to a big natural due to my hair being so fine. Since using this oil, for the first time ever of being 11 years natural, I am truly enjoying growing out my natural hair. My hair feels like someone else&#x27;s hair: full, voluptuous and full of sheen. This oil will thicken your hair; however, I have found that it does not permanently thickens my hair. It seems that the oil itself is so thick that upon application it seems to instantly thickens hair. But if I were to wash my hair and not use, my hair is back to the thin soft wimpy fro again. I give it five stars due to my hair loves this stuff and it is impossible for me to get a good hair day without it.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my edges and the summer heat. Keeps my hair looking healthy in shiny.</li>
    <li> love the product works well.</li>
    <li> I love this product and will order it again</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to get this oil, and it came in good timing, i ordered it on a saturday and got it on wensday, and i feel it working soon as i applied it! I&#x27;ve read so many great reviews on this product so far so good, and i will b getting different version of this oil</li>
    <li> First time purchase of JBCO and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but for other curious and possibly would-be buyers my experience so to date (only arrived two days ago) has been very positive. It&#x27;s practically colourless and to my nose almost entirely odourless. Consistency is that of treacle which I found to be it most surprising quality but actually this is a real plus because it stays where it&#x27;s been put as opposed to trickling to unwanted areas.&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea as to whether it fulfils claims regarding improved hair growth - that remains to be seen however, if you&#x27;re looking for a completely natural hair/scalp conditioner then i&#x27;d say meets that requirement and also has great gel-like styling qualities. Just remember, a little goes a long way - there&#x27;re plenty of hints &#x27;n tips on YouTube if you&#x27;re unsure how and when to apply but basically if you&#x27;re in two minds give it a try - for this price even if you find it&#x27;s not for you i&#x27;d say it&#x27;s definitely worth the gamble.</li>
    <li> this oil really grows hair very fast, i love this oil.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!! For some reason my hair was thinning and I&#x27;m only 33.  Well I heard about this stuff and wow!! It took about 2 weeks and now my hair is growing back nicely.  Its stronger, thicker, softer and healthier.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for use in deep conditioner mixture or as a pre-shampoo treatment.  The product arrived earlier than estimated and was well packaged.  I will contine to purchase products from this vendor.</li>
    <li> Still waiting on the benefits. Have been using on my hair and knee. Seems to help pain and makes hair soft.</li>
    <li> Love this, it is a little thick.</li>
    <li> I use to make my own hair product, very nice</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I read on a forum that it was great for beards as well as thinning spots of hair.  I used it for about a month and my bears is definitely thicker and fuller, and the thin spot on my head has started to fill in! I would definitely recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Very thick, too thick for my natural locs.  I gave it to my sister.</li>
    <li> Am enjoying it. Even thinking of getting another bottle. It works</li>
    <li> Started to see results within 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> JBCO absorbs wonderfully into the hair. Some people may find it a bit thick, but a little goes a long way. It also works will when diluted with other oils (olive, jojoba, coconut). I primarily use it for my edges while I have braids and to moisturize my hair after conditioning.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for hair and skin. Love the size of the bottle, I can&#x27;t find this size in the store.</li>
    <li> This product has started the healing process on my hair. My hair has been damaged by poor salon care and my hair had broken off way above the neckline.It was recommanded by an Amazon purchaser also.  GOOD CHOICE!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product for my hair, I love it, it takes the dryness out and put moisture in, it leaves my hair nice and silky, it hydrates my scalp. it doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell, the smell is very lite. It&#x27;s a big jar and it will last for a while for the price. It also good to condition my hair after washing it.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Jamaican Black Castor Oil for the purposes of healing my damaged skin. I have heard rave reviews about it, so I decided to purchase a bottle from my favorite online store for herbs and essential oils.  I used it for the first time this morning after I took my shower.  I had the weirdest reaction. I normally feel warm after I put on any type of butter (shea, khus khus, cocoa butter)on my skin. Using the black castor oil was a whole other reaction. I got so warm I nearly fainted! I had to lay down after putting this on my body. I have no idea why I reacted this way to putting something on my skin. Don&#x27;t know why it happened. This is not the most pleasant smelling but I will update my reviews in about a month to see if it really heals and repairs my skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff will have you scratching your scalp off. Don&#x27;t buy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell either. I was hoping I could use but the scratching was unbearable</li>
    <li> Castor oil, I&#x27;ve heard allot but never tried it.  This is another natural product that blows my mind.  I&#x27;m a huge fan of oils, but majority of oils are very light which is fine.  I&#x27;ve never experienced a heavy textured oil like castor oil.  If you have thick curly coily hair, this oil will make your hair feel like its really being penetrated with moisture.  It coats so well.  You can use it by its self of mix it with other oils or shea butter.  There are many different uses for this oil.  There&#x27;s also great skin benefits from this oil.  The smell is ok, and I do wish the bottle was bigger because I love to use allot.</li>
    <li> Now this is the REAL DEAL!! I am so happy with my purchase. It&#x27;s real and not misrepresented. I do not necessarily like the smell of the oil but the good outweighs the bad definitely!! I&#x27;m so happy about my purchase.</li>
    <li> Having never used castor oil before, I was unsure what to expect.  This oil is of a very thick consistency and is best used mixed with water or another oil for the ultimate results.  However, I have been using it almost daily diluted with water and occasionally spirit of camphor.  It has an incredibly relaxing effect on my muscles and it so very moisturizing.  I also took a bath with a capful of this, castor oil, a couple drops of eucalyptus oil, and a few drops of peppermint and it was amazing.  Very likely to purchase through this seller again because the price was decent and it arrived early.</li>
    <li> WARNING FOR THOSE WITH SUPER OILY/ACNE PRONE/ SENSITIVE SKIN PLZ STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT! ! ! I only used it at the most 5 times and during the day time hours so that i wouldnt get this stuff on anything especially where i lay my head (pillows). It was super thick. i mixed it with certain products but it was still thick when i applied the mixtures on my hair. it made my hair greasy. although i never used it at night due to not wanting to get any trace of jbco on my pillow cases it still somehow got on my pillow cases. im guessing because its so thick and greasy that you need to wash your hair a few times to get your hair feeling clean and normal again. but i&#x27;d use silk shower caps at night and of course it seeped through onto my pillow. I ended up throwing the whole bottle away. but since i did put a little in my daughter&#x27;s conditioner, her hair is super soft when i use it on her. i dont think its possible for babies to get acne from certain products just yet. but shes never gotten a bump from this product so i still to this day use the conditioner on her hair. But for me? it caused me to break out all over on my face. made my face more oily and greasy. i had to immediately use my salicylic acid chemical peel to dissolve all and any trace of jbco. will not purchase again. product arrived a day or 2 earlier then listed. Overall, not satisfied for my sake but i am satisfied for my daughters sake.</li>
    <li> Makes hair very soft and growth is phenomenal!&lt;br /&gt;Hair is well hydrated and shiny! Highly recommended! I love it alot</li>
    <li> I purchased this product approximately six weeks ago.  I suffered from thinning hair in addition to  severe  dandruff.  I currently wear a hair weave and found this to be the best time to start saturating my scalp on  a regular basis.  At first, I had intense itching in the exposed area, however the dandruff was almost completely gone.  After using this product for six weeks, I noticed my new growth doubled my normal growth rate. I am amazed! I am looking forward to continuing my hair journey with Jamaican Black Castor Oil.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my hair and ended up using it for aches andn pains. It is Great. I will say it again. IT IS GREAT!!!</li>
    <li> It really works.  Definitely a great buy.  The only thing is it is very thick so it is a good idea to mix it with another oil I mixed mines with wild growth hair oil and it doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Sometimes it itches my scalp but most of the time it does not. It keeps my hair soft and my hair is getting thicker because of it. It is not as thick as the regular castor oil which is good.</li>
    <li> Really thick. Moisturizes hair/scalp well. It is easier to apply when warmed up (Hot Oil Treatment). Made my short edges grow longer.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite products!! Works great when cut with another oil such as Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Great for edges.0</li>
    <li> Great product. It really does grew and thicken hair fast. Within two weeks saw a difference in my hair. It was softer and thicker. I mixed with extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li> Came quickly. Works well for what  i did it for. Will  gladly order from this group again price was right for the size. I have seen 4oz sold for the same price.</li>
    <li> this has been the best product for me to use on my natural hair that is normally dry and not easy to manage. the JBCO makes my hair soft and it locks in moisture. I use it as a sealer after I put moisture in my hair. GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I love this for my hair.  I was losing the hair along my hairline.  I put this on and it has completely restored my edges.  I keep this on stock at all times.  I found a bigger bottle at my local beauty mart for 10.00</li>
    <li> It seems to be working</li>
    <li> Love it for African American hair.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product and I have 3rd Degree Burns on my scalp from a permanent that was too harsh for my hair.  I took this and mixed it with Peppermint Oil.  Where I have had no hair for over 20 years, my hair is beginning to come back in.  Not like it was before, but where I had only skin I am now getting a little light bush!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone in need of something that has healing components in it.  You will not be dismayed - in fact you will be overjoyed!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS OIL, I AM ON MY SECOND BOTTLE, NEXT TIME I WILL ORDER TO LAST  AT LEAST 6 MONTHS.</li>
    <li> Worse product ever. A week after using the oil,my hair  started coming out really bad. I was almost bald My scalp was hurting so bad. I had no choice to cut my hair.</li>
    <li> I use this oil every day. Good stuff. I needed a hair product that would help with thinning hair. I got it</li>
    <li> Lasted a long time need to Re-up. Works great will order again soon. Went natural three years ago and someone recommended it to me to use on my hair and fell in love it.</li>
    <li> I am excitedly looking forward to good results from this product for hair care.  I also used this product for a dry skin patch and saw satisfying results.  Look forward to reordering this product for hair care.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!! Started seeing hair growth within the first two weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this not because of the actual product because I love Black Jamaican Castor Oil but solely because of the ridiculous condition I received it in.  I received my bottle broken into a million pieces with the oil spilled all inside the outside bag. The delivery driver also had the gall the wrap the package in a plastic bag that read &#x27;WE CARE, Sorry For The Damage etc.&#x27;. This probably isn&#x27;t the sellers fault but I wanted to warn everyone who is shipping this product  using USPS that I would highly recommend either not using them at all or getting insurance for their product. What a complete waste of $12...</li>
    <li> This is my second order of this product. I love it added to my Thank God I&#x27;m Natural Honey hair mask. I also apply to my thinning edges daily. I have seen improvement in my edges.</li>
    <li> I bought castor oil to help with natural hair growth, but I find this to be too thick for daily use.  I gave it to my mother who uses it occasionally.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with my hair and on my scalp. Its a little heavy for use in my hair, however,  I use it for other things like putting on my heels to soften my feet, and on my lips at night to keep them moist. It  actually has a lot of great uses so I will keep both bottles of the product that I bought.</li>
    <li> So far I like this product, I have been using it for a couple months it does&#x27;nt have a bad smell which is a plus I dislike that I can not purchase a larger size, and the price is should be less. I would recommend this procuct.</li>
    <li> This product has helped me with growing my sides back.  I use it 3times a week. I warm it place it in a bowl and I dip the  cotton balls in and place it on my scalp. It feels so nice and warm.  I do this at night to allow the smell to vapor while I am a sleep. The smell is strong.</li>
    <li> Even though the hair food worked ok, this product made my hair shed lots, I mean a lot. I would not recommend because I don&#x27;t want to be held accountable for someone who&#x27;s really in need and suffers from baldness.</li>
    <li> Excellent product to grow hairline in. This is a must have to grow your hair strong and healthy.I will repurchase this oil.</li>
    <li> Thank you for sending the Jamaican Black Castor oil I&#x27;ve been using it and is seeing hair growth I&#x27;m very happy</li>
    <li> Castor Oil can be purchased at any drug store.  There is nothing different about this except it costs a lot more.  If you have doubts, it is not returnable so do not purchase. I will not buy it again.  I thought there was something that would add to my hair improvements.  But it is just castor oil.</li>
    <li> This is the best oil by far that I have every used. This is an awesome product. I highly recommend the Jamaican Black Castor for bold spots. I read the comments and they were correct it does restore the hair that has been damage from braidings.</li>
    <li> Works great. Its a heavy oil so a little goes a long way. I have been using this oil in my hair for years.</li>
    <li> The product was wonderful but the packaging  was terrible!! I ordered 2 8oz bottles and they sat them directly on top of each other with no paper wrapping around it or bubble wrap around it and when it got to me one of the bottles was broke and all the castor oil was soaked up in the box. So I paid for 2 castor oils and only received one cause the other one broke</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I use it in the AM and PM on my feet and it makes it feel soft. I even use it in my hair by mixing it with my favorit conditioner. My hair feels so silky and soft. I wish I knew about caster oil sooner. Oh I forgot to mention that it was shipped quicker than I expected. Great product and great customer service. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> This works excellently on skin, hair, and scalp plus it can be mixed with any other type of oil.....TRY IT!!!</li>
    <li> My hairs best friend. This product is recommended for people with natural hair definitely too thick and oily for permed hair.</li>
    <li> i oil my hair with a mixutre of this and evlo. i love it. This has helped my hair grow so fast. great product love what you can use it for.</li>
    <li> I saw the reviews and decided to give it a try. It&#x27;s really working for me. A little goes a long way. Once I run out, I&#x27;ll be ordering more :)</li>
    <li> My hair looked amazing after only a couple uses! Recommend to anyone looking for body, shine and those wanting to grow their hair !</li>
    <li> great product after a week i feel my hair is already thickening, not a fan of the smell but its not a bad smell though no additives</li>
    <li> Love Love JBCO my hair lives it uses it mostly on my edges .  Starting to see growth great results</li>
    <li> My hair really grown and gotten thicker in a short amount of time.  I will recommend Jamaica Black Castor Oil to anyone who what&#x27;s thick hair this product really works.</li>
    <li> In the process of using cannot determine the pros or cons as yet</li>
    <li> love it!!! it makes your hair texture great and repair and regrow!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase! I was buying a smaller 4oz bottle from a local health food store for about the same price as this 8oz size. I will buy it from here again!</li>
    <li> Love love love!! My hair as well as my daughter hair has grown and become thicker to my surprise! I&#x27;m and african amercian women with natural hair for the past 6 years. I use grow aut oil with this product im doing the review for.They both seem to do wonders.</li>
    <li> product is awesome...totally loved it. Edges of my hair was thinning due to tight braiding. Saw results after one month of using, twice daily :) ordering another bottle, can&#x27;t live without!!!</li>
    <li> love this! i use it on my scalp for my 16 month old daughter and for myself as well. It keeps hair very soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product faithfully with scalp massages for 6 months now--wanted to give it a little time to do it&#x27;s thing before writing a review.  And I have to say I&#x27;m actually not impressed.  My hair seems to be growing at it&#x27;s usual rate.  I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in the thickness of my hair either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I did not have any areas that needed &amp;#34;re-growth&amp;#34;, so I guess I&#x27;m not the best person to comment on this.  However, I purchased some for my mom who did need to regrow her edges and she hasn&#x27;t really noticed much of a difference either.  Nothing but a greasy scalp.  So, with that being said, will not be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> Product smells loudly, but I like it. I purchased based upon the reviews on Amazon and from the recommendations of others.</li>
    <li> I use this for strengthening hair roots, it really does work. Amazed.</li>
    <li> Smells a little smoky for a few minutes.  It&#x27;s thick, and I use it for a pre shampoo oil with another oil,  Whenmy hair is in a bun, which it is most of the time, I massage a bit into my hair and scalp each day.  I love it, and credit my hair growth to it and some supplements. Seriously.  I also use it on my lashes, which have gotten lush!</li>
    <li> I grew up on this stuff and haven&#x27;t used it in years. But soon as I slatter it on, I am transportied back to my childhood. I used it for sinus congestion and although it isn&#x27;t a recommended use, I slatter it on my feet, put on socks before bed and by the next morning, my feet are as soft as a newborns. The effect will last up to 2 days. I probably should do it nightly but sleeping with socks on during the summer months...Not fun.&lt;br /&gt;I applied it on my eyebrow, an area that was balding and I can actually see some growth there. Mother Nature is good to us!</li>
    <li> The product is very effective in thinning hair, I received my product within the time frame given and I am completely satisfied. I will be making another purchase once I use this bottle!</li>
    <li> I always love this stuff ! Comes so fasr and it always works abd a great price Thank you (:</li>
    <li> Great buy bc it does what it suppose to do. I used it for hair. My brows grew back as well!</li>
    <li> My hair knows when I&#x27;m not using it so I try to not run out.  Works wonders for natural hair care.</li>
    <li> Looking like it&#x27;s helping to grow in overplucked areas of my brow. I apply every night before I go to bed and sometimes during the day. So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4/28/14 So it&#x27;s been a month and this stuff is a miracle. After being stupid and dying my eyebrows using box hair dye and overplucking when I was a teen, I&#x27;ve gone nearly 15 years with my right brow having no hair. I thought I&#x27;d never be able to show my face without my &amp;#34;brows on&amp;#34; but now I feel comfortable around close friends and family...still not at the point where I&#x27;d go outside without my brows done, but I&#x27;m nearly there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the oil (wish it smelled better) 1x a day since the end of March, sometimes I&#x27;ll apply it 2x a day. Now it&#x27;s the end of April and I&#x27;m so happy with the progress. I can actually use a brow brush and setting gel on my right brow, and when I fill them in I use less product and my brows look more natural!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t started using this on my edges just yet, the smell is really off putting and I don&#x27;t like my hair feeling greasy and oily. However, I might have to get over that and start this growth process with my edges too! The before and after picture is from 2014 when I first started but I forgot to add a pic. I noticed results about 3 months in with consistent use morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 12/21/16&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is a miracle! I can walk out the house and not worry about my brows anymore. The one that refused to grow has grown back nicely. I haven&#x27;t had eyebrows this full since I was a teenager! The single photo is the most recent.</li>
    <li> Love castor oil products.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. This is my 3rd bottle that I&#x27;ve purchased ! Makes my hair soft , thick and helps it grow . I got my mom to use it to help thicken up her edges.</li>
    <li> Love this oil. Will guy more.</li>
    <li> Best product if u r natural</li>
    <li> I would absolutely buy this product again. I purchased it because of all the reviews on YouTube and and I am a witness about how it has improved my edges. I braided my hair down (including my edges) applied this and some coconut oil and gave my hair a good rest under a U-part wig for a month. I took the U-part down after 2 weeks to re-moisture and then sewed it back in for the last two weeks before washing my hair and noticed a tremendous difference in the length, density and the harder growing areas along my edges. I would absolutely purchase this again. A little goes a long way so I imagine I will have this bottle for at least a long time.</li>
    <li> the product came in a timely fashion and i been using this oil for years i recommend this product to anyone with dry scalp and thinning temples this product is great for sealing and thickening i use it in my conditioners and by itself  its worth the money</li>
    <li> This oil was way too heavy for my hair.  I tried oiling my scalp with this to thicken my hair but instead noticed that strands of my hair kept shedding/falling out as I was applying this to my roots.  When I combed my hair after applying this oil to my roots, my sink was full of hair!  It was scary.  If anything, this made my hair thinning worse.  I was hoping this would help with my hair growth (based on the positive reviews) but it didn’t.  If you have fine hair, stay away from this.</li>
    <li> I used JBCO for 2 months in an almost balding spot in crown area. By itself, it did almost nothing, just a little fuzz after this length of time. BUT, as not to lose my investment, I decided to mix it with Vatika coconut oil.-half/half.  WOW!! Growth kicked in almost immediately.  After about a week, I noticed a visible increase in hair growth. and it is still growing. Been using them about a month now. You have to massage hair with these oils for at least 5 minutes daily in order to get noticeable progress. Like some of the other comments here though, I believe that regular castor oil will do the same job. I am somehat skeptical about this brand of JBCO, cause it does look and smell like regular castor oil.</li>
    <li> Love it because it is helping stop my hair from breaking.</li>
    <li> I heard it&#x27;s a good product for hair growth, unfortunately my experience was an allergy reaction. I still support the product n believe it can be a great use for hair growth</li>
    <li> This product just keeps on going... It is excellent as a moisturizer for the ends of natural hair and an excellent oil to brush onto eyebrows to gain thickness.  Castor oil is great as a natural hair softener too.  I will never be without this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this stuff. It immediately stop my scalp from itching. I also use it under my eyes...great for my bags..lol</li>
    <li> I will be getting more for my daughter thank you</li>
    <li> When I received my produce the bottle was completely broken and the box was soaked. Not happy at all. I will not be purchasing from here again.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  I will definitely purchase again.  I actually liked it better than the other brand that I had purchased on here.</li>
    <li> This stuff works! Shipping speed fast as well. Seen a difference in weeks! I wish I could post a picture of the difference. Also the smell isn&#x27;t pleasant but the results are. Thick consistency a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Being diagnosed wrong all these years my Dermatologist says I have  Alopecia bummer he says I will never get my hair back in places where the follicle is damaged I tell you the DR. &amp; DEVIL is a lie I am on my 2nd bottle I have hair growing I am so overjoyed with emotions thank you for making this product wish I knew about it sooner I finally opened up &amp; told my closest friend &amp; family one of them told me about this I am so grateful. ... I wash my hair once a week &amp; oil my scalp &amp; hair then braid it (color purple style) my eats up the oil the next day I rub the oil all over my braids before bed put on a plastic cap on then my scarf (I do this 3 times during the week)</li>
    <li> Works well with growing hair where there may be bald spots. Helps to thicken hair, works better when heated shortly.</li>
    <li> Really grows hair thick</li>
    <li> growing hairline back finally!</li>
    <li> I use it before I wash my hair. I do not own a hair dryer so I leave it on my hair and wrap my hair in a knot, so the oil can penetrate. It does not smell good, however, it works! My hair turns out soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> I may never purchase regular castor oil again! I love jamaican black castor oil!</li>
    <li> The oil is too thick for my hair</li>
    <li> The smell is a bit strong but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. My scalp itched for a few days in the beginning, but I know it was a part of the detox process. My hair responds well to JBCO. It is stronger, healthier and more manageable now.</li>
    <li> question authenticity</li>
    <li> the moisture is really intense that is what I like the most about the lotion. If anyone want good moisture for the hair this is good.</li>
    <li> Love using it on my hair</li>
    <li> I had sparse, thin eyebrows that weren&#x27;t growing anytime soon. J ordered this and decided to trial it for the month of June before I left a review, and I&#x27;m so glad j bought this! I put it on my eyebrows every night in June and not only did the growth start to kick in in under two weeks, but my eyebrows got darker and so much thicker! I&#x27;ve decided to use it for the whole of summer, without getting them done or anything. Then I&#x27;ll have them threaded before school starts. I&#x27;m so excited that I found a natural remedy to get the hair I want back!  Best thing about it is I didn&#x27;t even use a portion of the bottle yet. It looks as if it was never opened! I used a q-tip and rubbed it on and around my eyebrows. Be careful not to get it on the skin above though, I did that and broke out within a week. It&#x27;s just too thick for your pores. Other than that, it&#x27;s amazing! A great buy!</li>
    <li> I think I got a bad batch of that oil... the oil  is really dark in comparison to the previous bottles that I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It use to come in a glass bottle. I use it once a week on my scalp. I use it daily on my ends to lock in moisture.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> I used this for my eyebrows because I over plucked and my eyebrows are fuller so I no longer fill them in</li>
    <li> My edges are slowly coming back, but not sure if its the product thats working for me.</li>
    <li> Used it for close to a month. Didnt see much of a difference.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  Just a small amount moisturizes my hair and scalp.  It leaves my hair soft and manageable. I would recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Just beginning to use the product , so far so good. I am expecting greatness with no pain in my joints.</li>
    <li> Looking for results that my edges is growing by using this product, so far it is not working but it has only been three weeks.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! I use henna to dye my hair. My hair became so dry. I use this oil everytime before I wash my hair. It leaves smooth and softness for hair. Great product!</li>
    <li> I bought this just to grow my hair and as a healthy moisturizer. Didn&#x27;t use it as much on my hair but my eyebrows have grown since i used this! I haven&#x27;t felt the need to use it on my eyebrows now since they&#x27;ve grown so much, but its a great product overall! &amp; the smell.......I like it lol its not overwhelming as other reviews say.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good oil but I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my hair than if I had used olive, almond or any other oil. This is just my experience, however. I do have alopecia so if you don&#x27;t it may work for you.  I don&#x27;t have traction alopecia so it may work for that. It&#x27;s not a bad oil for keeping your hair and skin moisturized, but I feel I can find cheaper.</li>
    <li> This met my expectations and I was surprised that it didn&#x27;t have a heavy oily smell. It was recommended by a friend and I&#x27;m very happy I deceided to try it!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product..I was shocked when I received 2 broken bottles I&#x27;m so disappointed now:(:( ..I paid for nothing!!</li>
    <li> From medicinal to hair restoration, this product works!  Ethnic folks with split ends or damaged hair you&#x27;ll see results within weeks of using.  Pure and not diluted Jamaican Black Castor Oil is potent and reliable.</li>
    <li> Shipping was quicker than expected. Which should&#x27;ve been an extra 5 days. I&#x27;ve used castor oil before for my natural hair so I believe it was a great deal for she size when normally the smaller bottle costs just as much...overall satisfied!</li>
    <li> love the product so far. I have heard such great things about this product. The bottle is huge and will last me a long time...a good investment. The seller added a note in with the package that left a personal touch. ...very happy 5 stars!</li>
    <li> The product is ok I don&#x27;t feel like have had it long enough to provide an adequate review of the product but so far so good. the smell is a bit offensive but that is all.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it&#x27;s pretty thick and doesn&#x27;t smell the best but it works! I use it at night to rub into my scalp to get the blood flowing so that I can help my scalp to produce new growth. I love it, I also use it on my twist outs! Castor oil is nothing new, it&#x27;s  been around forever and that&#x27;s because it works!</li>
    <li> This item was sent in a timely manner and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is outstanding for restoring/strengthening hair. I use it to apply to the nape of my hair so that I can grow that out and I also use it to deep condition my hair the night before my wash. I also use it in my daily spritzer. Ensure that you don&#x27;t pile a whole bunch on your hair because it is a very thick solution.</li>
    <li> HAVE NOT USED THIS YET. GLAD I FOUND IT ON HERE. I AM NOT SURE JUST HOW TO USE IT. WAITING UNTIL I DO MORE RESEARCH.</li>
    <li> Love me my black castor oil... Hold moisture in my hair well. Although the smell isn&#x27;t the best. Just have to mix with other oil</li>
    <li> Works fast and good for hair</li>
    <li> Very viscous. Saw great results. Not ideal for someone who has relaxed or straight hair. Would try if wore hair natural</li>
    <li> Like this, my hair is growing, was surprised to see this, glad I purchase.  Going to get some for my sister, she lost her hair due to chemo treatment.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really work good with my hair. I love it and I mix it with some olive oil to be more smoothly</li>
    <li> Sooo I love this stuff. I have only been using it for about 2 months and have seen great results!!</li>
    <li> I seen hair growth in just one week. No lie! Not to metion it came super fast. Great purchase. Would definitely recommend to others</li>
    <li> I used the product on the ends of my hair helps protect ends from elements of the season. I also use a little as a sealant on my twist ( 4a/b type hair) also use on my feet as a moisturizer (soften skin on heels if you can stand to wear socks at night works better to soften feet)</li>
    <li> It was already broken on arrival! The packaging system was not brilliant at all! It&#x27;s a glass bottle people</li>
    <li> I found this product online.  I tried it and now I&#x27;m hooked.  I love the way it feels on my skin.  It is very healing for everything.  This can be used on baby, women and men.</li>
    <li> So far so good been using it for about a month now and as of yet I have no complaints. Thank you</li>
    <li> I have had this before and needed more.  Enjoy fast shipping</li>
    <li> I love the Jamaican Black Castor Oil, I use both the plain and lavender variety.  The scented one with the lavender has a nice calming effect.  I find that I use less gel on my locs and use this castor oil instead.  No thinning for me! :-)</li>
    <li> Jamaican Black Castor Oil is great as a sealant, and a scalp moisturer.......it&#x27;s a thick oil but it absorbs well.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes your hair very thick. I am all natural at this point and trying to grow my edges back after braids doing some serious damage. I see some fuzz coming in. I will give it 6 months of continued use</li>
    <li> The article I read regarding Jamaican Black Castor Oil said that there are fakes out there, and TRUE Jamaican Black Castor Oil will have an “ashy&amp;#34; smell to it. This DOES NOT, so because this is the only way I have to determine if this is true JBCO, I have to assume it is NOT.&lt;br /&gt;I’ll try another brand and see if it is the real thing.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get any outcome actually.</li>
    <li> I love it, although I do not use it consistently. This oil is very thick and so a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday on the nape of my hair and my edges they seem to be growing back nicely.</li>
    <li> My hair loves loves loves this!  This is a great price. I can&#x27;t find black castor oil in my neighborhood.</li>
    <li> Really bought this for an experiment and was not really believing it would make my beard grow but afftr about a mouth,  usage I have been noticing a lot of new thick hairs this stuff is awesome.</li>
    <li> I have used JBCO before, a little goes a long way. Great for dry tendency hair. It does have a smell but that quickly diminishes ( or am I just getting used to it) over time. I prefer to use it on hair that has at least been misted so it takes the oil on better. Great staple for natural hair!</li>
    <li> Really good oil for hair..helps to thicken and regrow hair. Ive been using for over a month now and the results seems to be positive.</li>
    <li> BLACK CASTOR OIL WAS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF OUR HAIR CARE REGIME GROWING UP IN JAMAICA......GRANDMOTHERS, MOTHERS ECT WOULD MAKE BATCHES OF IT, THE SMELL WAS VERY PUNGENT BACK THEN TO THE POINT OF EMBARRASSMENT......BUT IT WAS LIKE GOLD TO OUR HAIR. MUCH SINCE LIVING IN THE U.S.  (YRS NOW)  CAUSE I FIGURED I MIGHT NOT GET THE REAL THING......WELL THIS BRAND SEEMS GREAT......THE SMELL IS LESS NOTICEABLE BUT MY 4C/4B HAIR FEELS LIKE BUTTER WHEN I APPLIED TO MY HAIR THIS PAST (4TH JULY) I DEEP CONDITION MY HAIR ADDED SOME ESSENTIAL OILS &amp; CONDITIONER THEN STEAMED MY HAIR, RINSE &amp; THEN ADDED THE CASTOR OIL TO MY LEAVE-IN CONDITIONER, MY HAIR LOOKED HEALTHY, IT WAS SOFT &amp; QUITE MANAGEABLE, HAVEN&#x27;T HAD SUCH LUXURY IN YRS. LOVE IT WILL KEEP PURCHASING THAT BLACK GOLD.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for less than a month and I already see improve.  Spots in my head are filling in.  I thought my hair would never grow back.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff - enough said!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!! It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and sealer for your hair and it also promotes growth. But the number one reason why I love it is because it&#x27;s the ONLY oil that does not cause me to have dandruff NO FLAKES!!!!! I&#x27;ve tried sooooo many different oil and hair grease and this is the only one that did not give me dandruff allowing open pores for hair to grow. The smell is not the best but it&#x27;s not that bad either. Over all great stuff!!!</li>
    <li> My five star&#x27;s is for this product because it is great, I was told by someone about this product last year and it took me awhile to get it, and I just happened to check on Amazon to see if it was here and to my suprise, there it was, so I ordered it and have been using it for the last 6 mos and the product I would recommend it to anyone, because it does work. Not sure of the people that I did tell about this product if they obtained it, but I am glad I got it for my self. And once they see how my hair has returned then they will see for them selves...</li>
    <li> I believe it is too soon to know whether or not the Jamaican Black Castor Oil is good for hair growth.</li>
    <li> This pulled my hair out after only 2 days of use.  I had to cut all of my relaxed hair off and as of about a week ago, start all over.  This is a horrible product and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s real black castor oil.  Ameritrex  didn&#x27;t apologize when I told them of my issues and didn&#x27;t help me in anyway.  I will have to trash it and take the loss because they didn&#x27;t offer a refund.  I now have to buy even more products to try to grow my hair back.</li>
    <li> I use this twice a week on my scalp.  The smell is horrendous (I would have given it 5 stars if not for this one thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t like that part of it at all.  But, no pain, no gain.  I&#x27;ve noticed how thicker, softer and just BETTER this has made my hair and scalp.  To cover the smell, I use Aphogee Keratin and Green Tea Restructurizer.  A few sprays on my hair after using the Aphogee spray and Voila!...the smell is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix also mix this with essential oils and water for a nightly misting to keep my hair strong and healthy.</li>
    <li> I love using Jamaican black castor oil especially for my edges which has been growing very nicely since I started using it.</li>
    <li> It is of high quality and at a reasonable price on Amazon. I&#x27;ve recommended it to our families and friends.</li>
    <li> I mix this with the Emu Oil in an applicator bottle and apply nightly. I&#x27;ve been seeing growth since using this. I actually felt like my hair was growing like a weed at one point. I used to use a different combination as my sealer when moisturizing, but it was so greasy. Now I use this mix to seal also and it just soaks right in. I love this combo and will keep using it.</li>
    <li> This product is everything I expected.  A little goes a long way.  My natural hair tends to get very dry.. this product added moisture and sheen.  Very unpleasent smell.. I suggest adding coconut oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m originally from Jamaica and my mom used to use castor oil in my hair all the time. In my 5 years of being in the united states, this is the closest thing to I&#x27;ve come across to the actual real thing. I just love what it does for my scalp and my hair as well.</li>
    <li> Husband used it on his peaks at his edge and hair is growing.  Im natural and use it occsionally on my hair and it makes it very thick and long...great for my lashes too!!</li>
    <li> This is a nice product. It is a great product for natural hair as well as your skin. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I like to use it after I&#x27;ve washed my hair, to make it soft (because after I wash my hair, it is very coarse and unmanageable).</li>
    <li> The product was good at keeping my hair moisturized but not something I can&#x27;t live without. Will buy it locally if necessary.</li>
    <li> I bought this as many claim it &amp;#34;regrows hair&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m still waiting on results.&lt;br /&gt;The product however did arrive on time from the seller, I mention this as I live in Hawaii, and somehow packages seem to get lost once they cross the Pacific. Maybe with continued daily use I can see the regrowth to my edges that I&#x27;m hoping for.</li>
    <li> I live this stuff.  I kid you not, I started using this product on the edges of my&lt;br /&gt;hairline and I started noticing new. hairs&lt;br /&gt;coming from my scalp.  I apply it every other night.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a bottle for my mom.  So we&#x27;ll see how she likes it.</li>
    <li> I was recommended to buy it because I need it for the eyebrow growth. My friend is happy with the eye lash and eye brow. I am unfortunate when I don&#x27;t see any improvement at all.</li>
    <li> Does wonders for my wife&#x27;s and daughters hair!</li>
    <li> This item is not real Jamaican Black Castor oil and if it is it has been water down. The castor should be dark as the bottle it comes in except mine came a light black almost grey color.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with Emu Oil to help repair a hairline damaged by braids and tight styles. It feels very smooth and thick and I enjoy using it for my scalp massages. My only issue with it is the smell, slightly burnt or &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; is what most say. I haven&#x27;t used it consistently enough to see heavy results but may try this with the Lavender fragrance and see if I like it better. I currently use it when I deep condition my hair in addition to my cholesterol conditioner to help really moisturize everything.</li>
    <li> I swear by this as a hair grower. Before using this product I use to have alot of dandruff build up. I am glad I found this product also it thickens my hair. Not the best smell but mixed with coconut oil it works great.</li>
    <li> This product is great for keeping my scalp moisturized; especially while I wear extensions and can not get to my scalp that easily. I mix this with Pure Emu Oil and every time I take out my extensions, my hair is well hydrated and has grown significantly. When I massage it into my temples, it helps my hair to grow back in that area where it has thinned a bit. I love this product very much.</li>
    <li> This product is good, however it smells bad. Mix with a fragrant oil to soften the scent.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this product. After having it for not long at all the bottle broke way to easily.</li>
    <li> I originally brought this product to help with hair lost. After about two months I have seen some regrow in areas that were balding.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sticking with it a little longer. I also use it on my face and hands.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really used it yet but, after seeing it and smelling it lol it looks potent.. Lol fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I love the thick consistency. Don&#x27;t know if it makes hair grow. Haven&#x27;t seen any real benefits from using it.</li>
    <li> After using this castor oil my hair stopped breaking. I was using a more refined oil earlier and I was was seeing the difference. My hair has is getting thicker.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Been using this product for a couple of months. My barber is now asking where did this new growth come from. Still have a ways to go, but this has revived, multiplied, and thickened the troubled areas. Also, this has helped my grandmother&#x27;s hair as well. Due to certain medications, she encountered a great deal of hair loss...now her hair is thicker and fuller than ever. I&#x27;m jealous because it&#x27;s working faster on her than it is on me!  Lol Will continue!</li>
    <li> Edges grow back thick and fast, i will be purchasing this again by the time mine runs out. thanks a bunch !</li>
    <li> I liked it , but it has the very strong smell ...</li>
    <li> It is very thick and smells terrible but the I believe it is working on my hair. Would recommend to anyone looking to restore life and moisture to your hair.</li>
    <li> It was good, although the smell was like cigarettes burning. Waiting for the hair growth promised. Ordering more soon. Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product about three weeks, haven&#x27;t seen any results.  Am I being too anxious?</li>
    <li> I use this on my edges every night and slowly but surely little fine hairs are starting to fill the thin area. GREAT PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so excited it&#x27;s here! I&#x27;ve heard so many good things about this,  so I can&#x27;t wait to start. Shipping was quick. Love it.</li>
    <li> A big NO NO for fine textured hair.. Not sure if this was even the real thing.. Did nothing but make me smell like ash.. I&#x27;ll stick to my coconut oil!💁</li>
    <li> Came quicker than I thought. I&#x27;ve used it before, So I know it works already :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very thick and has a horrible smell. I mixed it with coconut oil and sweet almond oil for a hour oil treatment. Had to find some way to use and it not waste my money</li>
    <li> Perfect thing for my edges!!  Loveee it..does not smell to well  but hey its thick n works great so i dont mind</li>
    <li> This is a high quality oil does not have a strong smell to it,  and comes in a dark glass bottle! A little goes a long way!!</li>
    <li> I received my bottle last week and so far I have only used it once. The oil is really heavy so even with my hair tied up at night the oil seeped through and stained my pillows. That&#x27;s my only con. My hair is natural and thick and tends not to keep moisture but with my first use my hair and scalp stayed moisturized. I usually would have to greese my scalp 3x a week for it not to be dry.&lt;br /&gt;I know some people commented on the smell of the product but it bearable didn&#x27;t bother me at all. I will continue to use this product and give another update after 6 weeks and let you know if it help with growth</li>
    <li> Love it. Great it works well for thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I expected the jbco to be packaged in a glass bottle. Besides that I&#x27;ve purchased jbco before and the color, consistency, and smell (or lack thereof) is the same. This does wonder for the overall health of not only my hair but my scalp!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had alopecia for the past 7/8 yrs caused by a bad perm. Fortunately I caught it before my entire hairline was gone. I have enough baby hair to help keep it covered. With the help of Derma-Match its not to bad.&lt;br /&gt;I also braid my hair for growth in the winter and its a forgiving style with my alopecia, however it causes stress on my already thin hairline.&lt;br /&gt;When I take my braids out it always takes 2-3 months for my hairline to grow back and even still it&#x27;s not the same as if I didn&#x27;t wear braids for 6-8 months.&lt;br /&gt;I started using this product about a month ago and my hairline is as full as if I hadn&#x27;t worn braids in 6-8 months or more. I haven&#x27;t seen any growth in the areas scarred by the perm, but the growth where my hair is has been nothing short of miraculous.&lt;br /&gt;Now I can wear my braids without feeling guilty, because I no longer have to sacrifice my hairline in order to help the growth of the rest of my hair</li>
    <li> I was actually able to see a litlte growth around the temple area after using this product. I wouldnt say it was like miracle grow or anything. I must agree with the other reviews it is VERY smelly, I walked around smelling like roasted peanuts. Also, it gets very messy so be careful not to lie down on your pillows and sheets without wrapping your head up or protecting your sheets somehow.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about this product because it seemed like a fad that naturals were all using blindly.  But it admittedly helped to regrow my sparse hair along my hairline. The smell is definitely nothing to enjoy. But if you can get past that it is a good staple to add to your hair products arsenal</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 63 year old youthful BA women. Because of weaves, braids and chemicals for 10 plus years I&#x27;ve suffered with alopecia. I wear my hair natural and love it this way. But I had to move my hair around to cover the bald spots. Yall, know what I mean.&lt;br /&gt; Over the years I&#x27;ve tried just about everything. But my daughter recommended this .After using this product for about 4 months (I wanted to give it a good try)and  I&#x27;m see amazing results. I honestly thought all was lost and that my roots had been destroyed. But this has helped tremendously and I am grateful!</li>
    <li> used it for a while didn&#x27;t improve my hair at all. it is sticky and has a bad smell so you can&#x27;t just use it, wear a hat and go to work. I am actually being honest with you guys; what worked with me hair regrowth wise is getting propecia prescribed by a doctor and then using rogain with that.</li>
    <li> Works for rapid growth excellent product! A little goes a long way...would definitely buy again the smell is not to great but it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m  Using The oil on my hair . I just started using it ( 6 days). I will check back after day 30. I&#x27;m hoping to see some significant change in&lt;br /&gt;MY hair growth.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil based on the positive reviews seen, my desperate need to restore my thinning hair and positive recommendations by friends that have used it. I have used it twice since i received it a week ago. It is a thick oil and has a not so pleasant odor. The first time i used it on it&#x27;s own and it was too thick. I then mixed it with argan oil and coconut and it was much better the second time.</li>
    <li> I fully recommend this product especially since it is a great product for anyone seeking thick and healthy hair growth.</li>
    <li> This product works wonders in softening my hair. Since using this product I have no breakage or split ends. I usually apply a small amount before blow drying and daily at night before wrapping my hair.</li>
    <li> I use this after I wash my hair for edge control and it works. This stuff is super thick but it keeps my edges moisturized. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> What can I say. It seals in moisture. It&#x27;s a staple for my natural hair care. I like to mix it with peppermint oil for my scalp or seal my ends. A little goes a long way !</li>
    <li> Thiis product is so Amazing- I love it!!!!!!!  Well worth the money I highly recommend this product. I am so happy I purchased it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff actually does what it says and has my daughters hair growing. Love the texture and thickness of it a little goes a long way. I paired with Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s Marguerites Magic.  Love love love this product.</li>
    <li> This oil is absolutely fabulous for both the hair and scalp! It is highly affordable. And, it is great for use by itself or mixed with other oils too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some peope have commented on the scent of JBCO being not to their liking. Upon my first getting the product home, I took a bigg whiff of it. I did detect a slight, nutty scent to it and that was it. It&#x27;s scent was not found to be overpowering at all. And, neither does its scent linger in the hair for a very long period of time either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My special way of using this product is as a pre-treatment before I cleanse my hair. I apply it to both my hair and scalp either alone or mixed with either coconut or olive oil in an applicator bottle. Next, I put a plastic cap over my head. I keep the oil in for 1 hour in my hair. And, after such time is up, I then proceed to cleanse my hair thoroughy with my cleansing conditioner of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually have very sensitive skin and I have not experienced any bad reactions (itching, burning, rash, etc.) to this product at all. It has really helped to make my hair feel softer, look shinier, and gain increased health to it overall. Also, it has really helped to alleviate my issues with having a dry scalp. And, I have noticed a significant reduction in the amount of shedded hairs that I get now than before I actually started using this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is one that I truly plan to continue to buy again and again!!! I highly recommend JBCO to all!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I had lost my edges from having braids in my hair so I used JBCO twice a day I also added an essential oil (to mask the JBCO scent) &amp; it worked! I have my edges back!</li>
    <li> Pretty good at growing hair back , thick oil &amp; odd smell but i mixed it with another better smelling moisturizer so its not bad</li>
    <li> I am sooo happy with this product. I love what it does for my scalp and edges. I usually have a flare-up seborrheic dermatitis in the winter months. Not at all this winter. My edges had thin because of over processing of relaxers. I thought after going natural it will grow back. Not hardly. So I started using this about um, 8 months ago love it. I put it on my lashes also. Their growing and always shiny. Oh, I also put it on my ends. A little goes a very long way.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love, and my 4c hair loves it!!! I suggest buying it if you are natural it does wonders for your hair, my hair is thick, healthy and shiny...</li>
    <li> So far so good. Definitely makes your hair seem stronger! Will continue using it for a long time because it seems to be working worth hair growth too.</li>
    <li> I have not had it long enough to give a real review.  I am trying to give it a few months before I come to a decision.  I like the fact that I can use it any time because it does not smell, other than that I have no true opinion.</li>
    <li> I have being wanting to try the Jamaican so now I have it and I&#x27;m going to see how it work on my hair and see if it grow it I mix it with other oil hope it work for me want to keep my hair all woman want to keep their hair I think we just have to fight to keep it on our head if we want it so the way I go,lo!</li>
    <li> So it doesn&#x27;t has the best smell but it works and I sleep with a shower cap on at night for better hair nurishement</li>
    <li> I recommend this for anyone with dry natural hair.  It softens and oils your hair.  Because of the texture, it stay on your scalp for the entire day and helps stop you from scratching so much because of dryness.  I originally purchased it for my dry scalp but am pleased with how soft my hair has become.  I re-purchased the item because you can&#x27;t always rely on finding a product that will work without side effects.</li>
    <li> My hair is natural except for the part that leave out for my weave, so wat I did was perm it pretty often. One day I was in a rush and couldn&#x27;t spend time to rinse the perm out properly,  so within 2 weeks my edges were gone. Kinda embarrassing. Using this everyday for a month my edges grew back better than they were b4. Now I use it in my whole head.</li>
    <li> I am using it on my edges. I see the growth already and it has only been a couple of weeks!</li>
    <li> You will not go wrong with this product. I am African American and my crown area was thinning. I even thought of doing painful cortisone injections in that area. But after reading the reviews I thought I would give it a chance. I bought this product and applied it every night and massaged it in for 10 minutes. I also took weekly photos just to document my progress. After about 4 weeks I noticed tremendous growth. I&#x27;m still using it til this day. Just try it!!!!</li>
    <li> Appears to be helping my edges grow pretty well. Will be ordering more when this bottle runs out. Met expectations</li>
    <li> I think that this is the same oil you can buy anywhere, and much cheaper I might add.  It smells the same as the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; kind, and has the same viscosity... Therefore this was the last time I spend money buying the &amp;#34;Jamaican&amp;#34; kind.</li>
    <li> This oil is great and is everything that it&#x27;s said to be!  The shipping is fast too!  I definitely will be repurchasing!</li>
    <li> helped my eczema dry skin a lot and of course my edges within 2-4 months -use everyday!</li>
    <li> I bought this not on Amazon but in health food store. I went through a form of alopecia and this helped grow my hair back. My hair is long thick curly coily now. I admit it&#x27;s not the greatest smell so I add a few drops of essential oil to bottle or you can buy it with the essential oil already in it. The first few times used it it made my scalp itchy but my scalp adjusted plus I started putting just a small amount like a dab on my scalp and starting washing more frequently. I know some black women wash like once a week or two weeks but if you are applying this every day I think that&#x27;s a bad idea. Build up. . I wash of cowash like every two or three days. Now my hair has grown in I mix a little of it in my li and helps retain moisture. Not everything for for everybody but worth a try.</li>
    <li> I love this product I have been using this for a month now. I have since soo much new growth it ridiculous. My hair was already pretty thick it has gotten so much thicker because of this product. I absolutely LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way and there are so many uses for the Jamaican Black Castor Oil. It&#x27;s a great pirce and should be used in moderation.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a very goog castro oil, good price and free shipping, I received it after about 4days, I used on my skin, in my hair</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone with skin and/or hair loss problems. . .just a little does a lot. . .it works!</li>
    <li> I received my oil pretty quick and I used it a few times a week but only used a little because It is very thick and greasy.  I can say that I believe it did contribute to my hair growth.  I only used it on my hairline due to some breakage but I was also taking some hair vitamins and another product that I used which is why I only gave it 4 stars.  I still use it a little but I have slacked off from it.</li>
    <li> I have used about a month so far. I can better evaluate after 6 months of use. Stay tuned for an update...</li>
    <li> My edges are getting full and thick</li>
    <li> This product is a natural girl&#x27;s best friend. It keeps my hair smooth and soft and well moisturized. It smells a bit unusual but its not a horrible scent so its tolerable. It has a very thich consistency so you dont need to use much.</li>
    <li> Amazing product works perfectly for my stretch marks, definitely have seen a reduction in them, very thick but I have no problem with that, good for extremely dry skin too.</li>
    <li> This oil is super thick and rich. I use it for moisturizing and sealing, of course. I can&#x27;t say if it would be good to use as medicine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It truly does seal the hair well to help protect the cuticle from being damaged.</li>
    <li> Perfect scalp moisturizer especially for loc hairstyles.  No need to worry about build up.</li>
    <li> It was okay but didn&#x27;t see much changes</li>
    <li> Its a great product. it came in a timely fashion.  will definitely order again</li>
    <li> Using it as a hot oil treatment for my natural hair,  wish the smell was nice.</li>
    <li> Good product. Oil does not smell good. But I&#x27;ve noticed my hair thickening.</li>
    <li> Good Product, has a funny smell.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if it is all in my head, but I have seen a lot less hair falling out.</li>
    <li> Received this product broken in pieces. Oil was every where once i opened the package. It wasn&#x27;t packed securely. Its too much of a hassle to get a refund or get the product replaced</li>
    <li> I have 1/4 inch of new new growth after 7 days. It really works for growing your hair.</li>
    <li> Completely obsessed with this product. Great for moisturing hair and growth.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff it, it&#x27;s way cheaper online the. It is in stores I I would recommend this to my friends</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard/read tons of positive reviews, but after using it twice my hairline became overly ITCHY immediately. Is it only for naturals? I&#x27;m not a natural... could that be it? Results don&#x27;t seem to positive... unsure if I should continue use. Seems to be having an adverse reaction. Purchased only a week ago...</li>
    <li> I read lots of good reviews about this let me try hope it works!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great on natural hair. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and have received magnificent results with hair strengthening, thickening and growth.</li>
    <li> I bought for my hair for a health and growth challenge and I see improved health so far.  The smell is mild, and you can get a lot of daily use out of the bottle.  Its been almost a month and I&#x27;ve not used more than 10% of the bottle.  If I see a complete 360 in hair and skin health then i&#x27;ll move my stars up.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month now and I haven&#x27;t noticed anything. I rub a small amount on my edges because they are thinning but no growth. I also mix it with my super grow grease and I&#x27;m still waiting to see improvement.</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle I have ordered. This oil has been great for my thinning hair around my edges. It has thickened them up.</li>
    <li> my granddaughter wanted this, she loves this stuff</li>
    <li> My hair looks so much healthier, bouncier, and fuller than it did before. I just massage into my scalp after I&#x27;ve washed my hair, braid my hair, then head to bed (I use it the night before I go anywhere). It also helps with shedding ( I shed significantly less hair than I did before), breakage, and split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend this product!! Please use sparingly :)</li>
    <li> I received my product timely.  I was impressed with that.  The bottle was a good size for the price I paid AND it was full (some companies skimp in that area).  I purchased it for hair use and have only been using for three weeks.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my hair yet.  Time will tell and perhaps my rating will go up.</li>
    <li> The Jamaican Black Castor Oil seem to be working fine and seem to be working very well so far. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Smells funny... Very thick</li>
    <li> I only use it for deep conditioning.</li>
    <li> I have not gotten any of the amazing hair growth results that everyone raves about with this product. But its only been a month since I started using this Jamaican Black Castor Oil on my hair. I bought it to add to the Mega tek cocktail I started using on my hair 2 months prior. So I will continue to use it on my scalp with my Mega tek and see what happens after a full 3 months. Hopefully March will yield some exciting noticeable results. Conversely, I&#x27;ve been using it on my feet..my heels specifically...and it has done wonders in softening my feet. I massage it on my feet mixed with my regular moisturizing lotion twice a day. Also I wear socks at night after I apply the Jamaican Black Castor Oil. I also use it straight as a moisturizer around my eyes and my cuticles at night instead of the Vaseline I&#x27;ve used on them all my life. I think I need a little more time before I conclude that it doesn&#x27;t work at all. If nothing else I will purchase again to use on my feet.</li>
    <li> In just one use I noticed that my hair felt thinker and in month. My baby hairs are growing and my hair feels relatively stronger. I was using a texturizer and I dye my hair in intervals. It does hold in a ton of moisture but when distributing it on my hair it kind of takes some of my curl away and make it slightly more frizzy. SO HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT I AM LITERALLY SHOUTING FROM THE ROOFTOPS WITH JOY!! Before in a regular month I didn&#x27;t really notice much growth but with this i think I at least got 3/4 of a inch. My hair is still falling out just as much but its is definitely not breaking off as easily.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Jamaican black castor oil to use on my edges and on my hair. However, due to the sudden price reduction,I purchased a bottle from this seller. The castor oil was very runny and seemed watered down. It was not thick like its suppose to be and it came in a plastic bottle,not glass. I will order from another seller next time.</li>
    <li> I use this in my homemade hair masks. Works for growing hair faster! I simply love this product! Works better than others. Google it!</li>
    <li> Just like the white castor but better. I haven&#x27;t seen any hair growth yet  but it moisturize  my scalp and it stop the itch.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. I have not been using this product on my hair long enough to tell whether or not if it will actually aid in hair growth or thicken of thin edges. But, this oil is thick and I find that it works best with 50:50 mix with Sweet Almond Oil. The mixture works well with my kinky curly hair type, and my spirals are so soft and shiny because of the oils. Additionally, I have noticed when using the oil alone or with my favorite deep conditioner, the oil has a funky odor. I had not noticed the smell until I mixed it my conditioner, and I will not be doing that again.</li>
    <li> I was told by a friend about Jamaican Black Castor OIl and decided to try it. I love it and will never stop using it. I love the natural smell and the soothing qualities of the oil. My skin reacts to the oil very well. It seem so natural. I am a fan and user for life. I only wish I knew about this earlier. I am telling all my friends about the oil. Tropic Isle Living did a good job packing the oil and I got it pretty fast. Thank you Amazom for asking.</li>
    <li> It works so far.  My locs needed the moisture.  I&#x27;ll continue to use and will update in about 2-3 months</li>
    <li> I have dread and my dread was breaking out. Using this oil my hair gotten so much better. My hair become more full and thick.</li>
    <li> It does what I heard it would do which is grow my hair I love it !&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to Everyone</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says irfan will do. To me, it smells like African food, specifically jollof rice, so the smell wasn&#x27;t anything new to me. I have NO complaints</li>
    <li> It is sticky and smelled awful. I had to dilute it with a lot of water to reduce the sticky and smelly.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for its all purpose use.&lt;br /&gt;It can be used as a hot oil treatment along&lt;br /&gt;with rubbing on your face as a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;It was a smooth transaction and I will buy&lt;br /&gt;this product from this seller again. Thank You!</li>
    <li> I have been natural since 2006. I have been using this product as part of a Castor oil challenge for about a month. so far, my results have been great. I already had thick hair but this has made it even more thicker and healthy.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil after reading several reviews about how it helps to grow hair. unfortunately, when I used the oil I had severe itching of my scalp - could not sleep due to itching. I stopped using product. Then I thought that maybe I should have diluted the oil. so I tried using the  oil again this time mixed with tea tree oil and the itching returned. I no longer use the oil.</li>
    <li> I got my product &amp; have been using it for about a month now &amp; it is no b/s it really works. I use it in my daughters hair, my hair &amp; for our skin. I have smooth skin but could not get rid of these bumps that was by my side burn area I used JBCO &amp; in two wks or less its gone &amp; now I can officially say my face is flawless.</li>
    <li> Received my second order of this wonderful oil...the company packaged it so nice, so that no leakage was experienced.  Very good for all hair types, works better on damp hair (let it air dry); afterwards there is no greasy feeling....I will definitely purchase this product again, perhaps even the lavendar black castor oil.</li>
    <li> if i was brave enough to post before and after pictures. my edges have always been thin, but using this the last couple of months ive seen a huge difference in my edges</li>
    <li> I only wish the bottle cap locked, it instead closes but if you go another 1/8 of a turn {to make sure the cap is on tight} then it&#x27;s full open again. The product itself is great!</li>
    <li> Great price. Great product.</li>
    <li> this stuff really works!! in a couple of weeks i noticed my hair thicker and less hair fall</li>
    <li> Good Bproduct and my hair luv&#x27;s it!</li>
    <li> Love how it feels in my hair. Made my hair grow super fast. It works well</li>
    <li> Awesome great value cheaper than beauty supply store</li>
    <li> Really thick, lasts a long time. i like it a lot, don&#x27;t mind the smell.</li>
    <li> Would recommend......</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see results yet, I hope this product work. I have spent a lot of money on products that suppose to work.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s one of my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; items for my hair besides distilled water. Besides e.v.o.o this is the only oil I use in my hair, although it is extremely greasy it&#x27;s worth it. I use it twice a week and it is the best on helping hair grow thick AND healthy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil for my daughter who decided to go natural on her hair because it was damaged from over processing.  She loved the oil and uses it along with other natural oils and cr&amp;egrave;mes. Her hair shows definite improvement. I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast , I&#x27;m currently enjoying the product it grew my eyebrow back within a week or so . And working on my nape now hopefully it gets to where I want it . But I love it</li>
    <li> This product honestly works wonders for your hair and increasing the thickness. I would suggest purchasing a larger oz though.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended product! I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Great but has a slight smell to it.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works if u used it everyday! I just love it, my hair was thin on the side and i start using this stuff everyday for a month and the results r remarkable cant say anything bad about this product. As i said before I Love It,</li>
    <li> Good oil just use it sparingly. Smell again is not very good.</li>
    <li> I like this oil. I dont think it did anything fantastic, but I also don&#x27;t use it on a daily basis. My hair likes it&#x27;s thick consistency so I have no cons because my hair likes it. I just dont think it made it grow faster or anything like that.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try this oil because of the price and reviewers who complained of odor. I still think the price is too high. As for the odor, it&#x27;s not really an odor, more of a strong woodsy smell. It reminds me of burning wood (the smell you get after lighting a match). The smell is not over-powering, but it is present. I added a few drops of peppermint essential oil to neutralize it a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This castor oil did make my hair extremely soft, though! I have thick coarse natural hair that has a lot of shrinkage when wet. My hair also tangles easily. I washed, conditioned, and detangled my hair then applied just a tiny amount of oil while doing two strand twists. I focused mainly on my ends. (This oil is extremely thick. You only need a very small amount.) I couldn&#x27;t see any difference while my hair was wet. But the next day when it dried, it was so luxuriously soft. My twists had a lightness and sheen that I&#x27;ve never had before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks after that one wash and application, the same luster, softness, and sheen are still present. Overall very happy with this product! Just wish it were less expensive.</li>
    <li> It was to my satisfaction.</li>
    <li> my wife uses it by the gallon</li>
    <li> Perfect product for a person with baby hair. My baby hair started growing</li>
    <li> Scalp had an Allergic reaction causing breakage and flakes.</li>
    <li> I have Alopecia and within the first week I seen hair follicles ... Just happy something finally works</li>
    <li> I love the thickness of this oil. Works well as a hot oil treatment</li>
    <li> I like it and it does make your hair grow just don&#x27;t smell good</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. A friend of mine let me try some of hers, it worked so well on my hair that I ordered a bottle myself. It controls the frizz and adds shine. My hair is a curly mess ... this stuff is great!</li>
    <li> Wow this oil really does make my hair so much thicker and really contributes to my hair growth, I make sure I don&#x27;t run out cause it really works for me just give it time...</li>
    <li> I gave 2 stars (don&#x27;t like) because the product I received doesn&#x27;t seem to match the descriptions in the reviews.  The product I received is closer to clear than amber, but there is a slight tint. There is no presence of ash or any herbs it&#x27;s just smooth oil.  The smell is very faint like mineral oil.  The consistency is between olive and baby oil, so it&#x27;s definitely not thick.  I have used the product for a month faithfully, once daily, then twice daily on the weekends due to time.  I noticed my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch as much, but that could be because I&#x27;m using oil, which adds moisture to the area, but no growth and hair is still shedding in strands.  I am still hoping castor oil will help me so I will finish the bottle, and I poured the oil in a different bottle as soon as I received it so not refundable. I just may have to purchase from a different site next time.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review, but I must write one hoe JBCO! It works!!! I was experiencing severe shedding and thinning at the crown of my head. Also in the back of my head I had a bald spot. Started using JBCO and within a week I noticed the difference. I use it daily, I also put 4-5 drops in my weekly protein conditioner. Don&#x27;t be discouraged by the thickness of the oil, a little goes a long way. Be patient, and consistent. You will see the results.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because a random lady in the parking lot of the movie theater commented that &amp;#34;my hair used to be like that.&amp;#34;  She was referring to my thinning edges.  She went on to say that she used Jamaican Black Castor Oil and her hair grew back in 3 weeks.  &amp;#34;Really&amp;#34;, I said politely.  But I noted silently that she wore a quick weave so how was I to know that the product actually worked.  My hair has been thin around the edges for as long as I can remember.  And since I&#x27;m no longer wearing my hair relaxed and straight, I&#x27;m unable to hide my thin edges.  For the past 9 months, I&#x27;ve been wearing my hair in a teeny weeny afro.  Although I love my hair and embracing its natural texture, I am still subconscious about my edges. So before we parted for our respective movies, I asked, &amp;#34;what was that product again?&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ve been trying countless remedies to help my edges grow, so what the heck, I&#x27;ll give this a try as well.  And I&#x27;m sure that no longer using a relaxer helps as well.  Anyway, I&#x27;ve been using the Jamaican Black Castor Oil for  about a week.  And yes I&#x27;ve noticed some improvement.  If my hair continues to get better, I will upgrade my rating to 5 stars:).  Hope this helps someone else.</li>
    <li> This is my very first time using this product and I have admit i love it so far. Great affordable price that I couldn&#x27;t beat..</li>
    <li> I really love this caster oil! It&#x27;s great for the hair. It seems to be helping my hair grow too.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I am using this oil twice a day, and have not seen any results as of yet. Please inform me as to how long it takes to see results. Do i have to use some of the other products with it?</li>
    <li> Great product! I use 2 tbs if this oil inside my shampoo! It is great for your hair. It helps to grow your hair.</li>
    <li> Really thick consistency. Worked well to grow back my edges.</li>
    <li> good product just don&#x27;t leave in too long if your hair is really thin you may just want to use it 30 min about an hour or just 30min to see what reaction your hair will give you</li>
    <li> I actually think this product helps with dry scalp because I have noticed when I use it my dry scalp tends to go away.</li>
    <li> This bottle cap was broken. It did not smell like Kamaican Black Castor Oil. It smelled like plain old everyday castor oil. Do not buy from this company. They knew full well that the cap was broken because it was so weirdly wrapped that I just knew they were aware of the defect.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I heard about it on YouTube how different women of all race ethnicity, talks about how it moisturizer their scalp. I used it first  to grow back my edges and wow! It worked after two months. I put a small few dots around my edges and I massage it in for 10 minutes. I now do hot oil treatments. Let it set in my scalp for 30 minutes then I wash it out using. Follicle Cleaning shampoo, by (Healthy Hair Plus). I thank god for this product. I finally found something that work! Yah  Iyauna Dearing</li>
    <li> I really liked the Jamaican Castro oil. I am Jamaican but it was hard for me to find the oil that I was looking for. This oil works wonders, even in a week! It really thickened up my hair, made it healthier and gave it shine! I will definitely be purchasing more very soon. P.s, it kinda has s strong scent and the oil is very thick itself. Good luck!</li>
    <li> works like magic! very moisturizing and it promotes hair growth</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard many great reviews about this oil.  I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to get the results i&#x27;m looking for, however, It makes my hair feel great! WOW!  I use some in my deep conditioner, sit under a steamer for 45 mins, when i rinse it out my hair is considerably softer.  You guys must try this.  My daughters hair is natural and it works wonders in her hair as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it directly on my roots and I like it too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell was my next concern, it does have a light nutty scent, but not over powering. By the time you complete your hair care with other nice smelling products, you can&#x27;t smell it at all.</li>
    <li> There is a lot of this product for the money, couldn&#x27;t find it cheaper anywhere else.  I use it for my hair, hate the smell but it makes it shiny!!</li>
    <li> It made my skin soft. my lashes are healthier and longer. It also makes my hair nice.</li>
    <li> I love Jamaican Black Castor Oil!  I use it on my edges to stimulate hair growth.</li>
    <li> I find it difficult to rate this product because I have not been using it consistently. It was sent on time by the seller and the product received was what I purchased. In regards to growing my thinning edges, I cannot honestly speak to this yet. I hope to have some additional information in four weeks.</li>
    <li> I am a woman, I am reviewing this product through my son&#x27;s Amazon account. I purchased this for the first time in May. I have to admit I was skeptical at first but I wanted to help my edges so I gave it a try. It does itch but YOU CAN MIX IT WITH AN OIL LIKE COCONUT OR WHATEVER YOU LIKE TO ELIMINATE THE ITCHING. Once I mixed it with coconut oil the itching was completely gone. I&#x27;ve used it since May 2013 and I am a believer now. I actually have edges again. I will continue to purchase this. It is a must have in my hair regimen. My edges are back and my hair is much thicker. I also add it to my deep conditioner. --Mrs. Mckinlia Laphand</li>
    <li> The smell can be a little off putting but this product is incredible.  My hair bounced back so fast with this.  It is like intensive deep deep therapy.  I finally ran out, it lasts a pretty long time, but definitely plan on getting more.  To me its a miracle product.  Amazing!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am an african american with relaxed hair, I was experincing some dryness so I did a pre-poo with this oil and got fantastic results. I also mixed some with my conditioner and sat under the steamer for 30 minutes and ended up with soft hair.</li>
    <li> This oil is great! I have heard so many great things about it! I&#x27;ll purchase this again! I love that it doesn&#x27;t have any other ingredients, but castor oil!:)</li>
    <li> ive only been using this for about 3 weeks now so i dont have a lot to say about it other than the smell.. gotta go easy on the stuff</li>
    <li> I rubbed this on my edges at night, every night and maybe about 3 days out of a week in the morning. My edges grew back totally in about 6 weeks time. I just picked my bottle up again for continued growth and thickness.  It worked for me! and I will buy again.</li>
    <li> love this stuff. help my hair to grow back. will order again.&lt;br /&gt;thank you so much. God Bless you and staff</li>
    <li> Great product, my mother has been using it for about 4 months now for hair thinning at the top of her head, and has seen a slight difference which still is better than many other natural products she tried which had no effect. It&#x27;s also a good moisturizer in general.</li>
    <li> Love this ish buy it all the time.</li>
    <li> Noticeable hair growth for my hair line ..</li>
    <li> It is really thick and didn&#x27;t promote new hair growth.</li>
    <li> Always love using Jamaican black castor oil. This particular one has a strong odor, therefore I have to use essential oils to give it a better scent.</li>
    <li> It smells like burnt trees, but it wears off after a while. It&#x27;s thick like syrup but not sticky and it makes my hair fee amazing. I&#x27;m natural and doing the 30 day castor oil challenge, and so far, it&#x27;s been doing what I hoped.</li>
    <li> Did work well with my natural hair. It irritated my scalp, I hAd to wash it out.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my hair when I cut my hair really low. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> keeps my hair moisturized</li>
    <li> Good and nice and fast delivary</li>
    <li> Amazing oil! It has definitely helped to decrease the amount of hair loss that I&#x27;ve been experiencing since I was 17 years old. I used to lose a heartbreaking amount of hair daily... now it&#x27;s reduced to a couple of strands throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have thick, silky, beautiful, long hair which has drastically fallen out over the years...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the reviews I read before purchasing the product and now agree that this is a heaven send... I am eager to see more positive changes over continuous use. I currently oil/massage my scalp once every 2 or 3 days. I am of East Indian descent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the Pura d&#x27;or line of shampoo and conditioner for hair loss. They&#x27;re a bit pricey, but worth the price to stop hair loss and hopefully regrow my God given tresses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps,&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars is bc the oil does break out my sensitive skin. My face has broken out quite terribly, but it&#x27;s been so good for my scalp, that I don&#x27;t want to stop using it. I&#x27;ve begun sleeping with a shower cap the nights I massage this oil into my scalp. Hopefully this will prevent any future breakouts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product. I actually get results after a week of trying it. I could see little hairs growing on my bald spots and also noticed that my hair is growing faster.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend buying it with the applicator though, makes it easy when applying it.&lt;br /&gt;Some of you won&#x27;t like the smell and the consistency but it worth it. Best oil treatment I ever tried :D</li>
    <li> This product came in a timely fashion and performed as I expected.  A friend&#x27;s hair that I had admired as being, healthy \\&quot;good hair\\&quot; always had a lustrous sheen.  Not greasy.  She finally shared her secret.  I use a bottle and tip application method and screeze directly onto my weft braid under my weave.  Be sure to not apply oil to weaved hair unless you want to weigh it down or use as a hot oil treatment.  The black version doesn&#x27;t smell great, but not offensive or overly pungent.  Enjoy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product about 3 weeks now and already I can tell a big difference in my hair and not only that it is growing like crazy...I have natural black hair. You will not be dissappionted.</li>
    <li> Great for relieving fibroid pain and shrinking them. Helps move fluid out of body. Good for growing thick hair when applied to scalp.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great when you mix it with Mega-Tek, which can also be bought on Amazon. I got a small plastic container, mixed the two together until light-medium brown, and put it on the part of my hair that needed it every other day. Just put it in the sections of your hair that you part with a comb. It really works, but smells funny.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of JBCO. My hair loves this stuff. I&#x27;m all natural and I use JBCO to seal my hair after moisterizing. It&#x27;s very thick and heavy, so a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I originally ordered this product with other oils to mix with [[ASIN:B001CCZMMQ Mega-Tek Rebuilder Hoof, Mane &amp; Tail, 16 oz]]. After reading reviews of this oil I decided to use it alone, I&#x27;ve been happy ever since! At first I hated the smell, but I got over that. My hair is softer, thicker and more manageable. It&#x27;s not greasy like most oils either, I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;ve ordered my second bottle.</li>
    <li> So I did a little research before getting this product.  My coworker told me that she was thinning and she started using this and it made her hair grow back so I figured I&#x27;d try it out since I have some thin areas.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now and I can see a difference.  I have one area that looks like the hair it growing back (not thick but it&#x27;s a difference) and another area that is still thin but seems to be slowly getting there.  I apply this to my scalp in those particular areas every night and rub it in.  This also helps with dry scalp!  I even have my mom using it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very thick so a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s great as a sealer for colder months or for a deep conditioner. It left my hair very soft.</li>
    <li> My hair and eyebrows are a lot thicker after using this. My only complaint is this oil is very thick and greasy wish I could use this on my skin as I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s pretty good but then again loving my natural hair more since I started using this.</li>
    <li> I was told by couple of Jamaicans that this is not a Jamaican Black Castor Oil, they said the color of the Jamaican caster oil is Black, i got one from Jamaica and  color of oil is black, this one is not.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this oil to keep hair soft and manageable.  I have natural 4c high porosity hair so it tends to dry out quickly.  Jamaican black castor oil definitely leaves my hair soft and full all week. It feels amazing.  The smell is strong when you first put it on, but it doesn&#x27;t linger.  You really can&#x27;t smell it unless you get right up on it.  It will definitely mess up your pillows so be sure to protect them.  I have some scarves I wrapped my hair with when I first used this and even after washing they smell like old oil.  Like an old kitchen cloth!  Tropic Isle is excellent.  No fillers, just the pure oil.  When I&#x27;ve seen other brands they often have other oils added.  I originally bought this because of all the reviews about hair growth.  I did not see any dramatic results in that regard, but as far as leaving hair soft and manageable, it was excellent.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!!! I have been using it for a couple of years.  I use it on my daughter natural hair and my permed hair.  It hydrates dry hair and has filled in thinning and balding areas on my hair and my daughters.  It is in my daily and weekly hair regimen.  I stopped using it for a couple of weeks to try some other natural oils.. The other oils worked ok but my hair missed and needed the deep penetrating moisture i get from the black castor oil.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after hearing about it by other reviews I read and viewed on Youtube.  At the time I bought it, I was struggle with hair loss due to a product similar to hair relaxers.  I was sooo scared and distressed.  So I decided to purchase the Black Castor oil.  I applied it by using an empty Clairol dye bottle (you can get at Sally&#x27;s or thru Amazon).  I like the bottle because it has a super tiny tip and it is easier to dispense the oil onto the scalp.  I used the product for sometime, every night before going to bed.  Put it on, then massaged my scalp (with pads of fingers - not fingernails) for about 5-7 minutes.  And, within time I began to see new growth.  It is my miracle in a bottle!  Would recommend it to others with similar issues.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because I wanted to grow out my hair. I have natural 4A fine hair and my edges needed regrowing. With a proper routine, this product seals in moisture extremely well. It doesn&#x27;t smell nice and its very thick, so a little does go a long way. But it does a great job of sealing in moisture for healthy hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter told me about Jamaican Black Castor Oil after see did some research on it, she has been using it on her daughter hair and have seen results already. I ordered one for her and one for my self I also like what I&#x27;m seeing.</li>
    <li> This product worked really good on a regimen I was doing to grow my daughter hair out her hair grew alot with proper care and usage of this product. Just not to fond on the smell but its&#x27; not unbearable.Definitely recommend it I usually it mostly to seal after moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! And it came to my home so fast! Will be ordering again</li>
    <li> This product Jamaican Black Castor oil- I use it for my dry scalp and I believe it stop the itching and the dryness. Since the weather is starting to change, I feel my scalp is needing the oil again. I have stop using it for a while but soon will be needing it soon. I also, used the NEEM oil for the same thing, itching and dryness to my hair roots. Both of these products helped me out when my hair was in so much trouble.</li>
    <li> This is the best Jamaican Black Castor Oil. My thin edges is growing back nicely, along with the rest of my hair. I oil my hair twice a day. In the morning and at night. I put a silk head wrap on my head before I go to bed. I have recommeded this oil to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> I use this in my hair products due to my hair falling out from a bad dye job ...and I started to see hair growth almost immediately. It does have a slight odor but since I started mixing it with other oils and herbs I don&#x27;t notice it.</li>
    <li> Love this product also, good for your skin. Us it on my face for a cleanse, Also on my hair.</li>
    <li> What a RIP OFF!!!  Yes, it is in. DARK BOTTLE...BUT THE OIL IS CLEAR !! I was SO SHOCKED WHEN I OPENED THE BOTTLE TO SEE CKEAR OIL...WHAT A RIP OFF!!!</li>
    <li> I love it. I bought it to use in my hair and it&#x27;s worth it. I will be purchasing again once needed.</li>
    <li> It really did not do nothing for me besides making my hair soft. Would not buy it again in the future.</li>
    <li> Gotta to have this in you hair Cabinet .. Straight out of the Island Jamaica&lt;br /&gt;Thick Healthy Hair .. A little goes a long way so you will get your Money&#x27;s worth!!</li>
    <li> Never heard of this product before, but am glad I ran upon it one day while searching the internet for black hair products.&lt;br /&gt;It is true to its word, you must mix it with other oils or hair products because of its thickness and smell. great product</li>
    <li> I truly love it, it gives my hair the moisture I was looking for.Truly great stuff , I love it.</li>
    <li> Have only been using a month today.  I do see thickness of hair, but no growth.  Will rate again after I finish 8oz bottle.</li>
    <li> My hair loves this stuff especially during the cold winter months. It arrived well wrapped and packaged to avoid any accidents.</li>
    <li> This oil has become a staple in my hair care regimen. Great for growing your hair and thinning edges. I would highly recommend this product to everyone</li>
    <li> I bought this to help my nails and eyelashes grow.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see any difference in either yet.&lt;br /&gt;I will give it more time.&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared for the smell though. Smells like burnt popcorn!</li>
    <li> Good but I broke the bottle but I will order again</li>
    <li> If you are experiencing breakage, this is a great product. I massage my sides and apply all over my hair. I use daily.</li>
    <li> Best ever to promote hair growth! 4c hair type, big chop 3 Mar 2012 3&amp;#34;. Today 2 Jun 14 12&amp;#34; hair length.</li>
    <li> I mixed 1TBSP of JBCO with some raw shea butter, 1TBSP of raw coconut oil and 1TBSP of Extra Virgin Olive Oil. It made my 4B type hair feel so good and moisturized. You can add other essential oils like lavender, tea tree or peppermint oils to make it smell better. The rule is over 6 oils 1tsp of each. Under 6 1TBSP of each.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t Do What It stated, Used For 6 months.</li>
    <li> An excellent product! It has a strong smell, but I mix it with other products to mask it. I use it in my hair to help re-grow a small area of thinness and it seems to be working!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any changes since I started using</li>
    <li> Sticky but good stuff</li>
    <li> The oil is great,  the smell is fine mix it with others oils, a little thick , i only use once a week</li>
    <li> Amazing! Makes my hair so soft</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product. It softens and makes my hair shine. I&#x27;ve also used it for massage, and it helped my muscles stretch well. The smell isn&#x27;t bad either. I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better product.&lt;br /&gt;👍</li>
    <li> Ive been using this pr for 3months now applied twice a week to my scalp and ive noticed my hair that was already thick is now longer and thicker. It doesnt leave that smell lingering in your scalp either in case the smell frightens you.</li>
    <li> This is a staple in my hair care regime. It finds its wait into my pre-poo, hair oil mixes, hair butters - everything!</li>
    <li> Works great, jut be sure to be consistent!</li>
    <li> Love this product,  definitely will remain a staple in my haircare routine.</li>
    <li> Came faster than I thought and it is good quality.</li>
    <li> amazing it really works will purchase again!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this all very pleased with it</li>
    <li> My hair is growing at an unbelievable rate. I had a bald spot for at least a year and since i started using the JBCO it has grown at least 2 inches a month.</li>
    <li> So far its working great. I have to use the product a little longer to really be for sure!</li>
    <li> Great product that I  found and so glad I did. Got braids for the summer and my edges were gone. Read reviews on this and I ordered it, so glad I did. It works and I&#x27;m coming back for another bottle</li>
    <li> Did not do anything special for my natural hair.  This product does not live up to the hype they gave it.</li>
    <li> I received my jbco January 18, 2014 I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 days and already see results. I can&#x27;t believe what I&#x27;m seeing, my hair was pulled out in the top and my crown was already gone I had used everything fertilizer serum from organic root stimulator which works good for some people. My top was pulled out with glue by a girl that was doing my hair she was not into hair care,but was a good stylist. I could hear the hair ripping from my head!!!!! Awful experience so now I have so much hope I also ordered the Emu oil  and will use this along with my JBCO.</li>
    <li> This oil is long lasting and moisturizes like nothing else. Wonderful oil can be used for just about everything! Buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Castor oil in general does wonders for hair. I have super thick 3c and 4a African American hair. Within a month of use my hair seemed shinier and stronger. I prefer the extra dark castor oil, but no matter the brand nor the color castor oil in a win in my book. I have repurchased this product and gave to others for a Christmas gift. This is a staple product for me and I apply it 4 times a week at bed time and sometime add this to my natural conditioner. With you are natural or relaxed castor oil can benefit you. If you have edges that would not go, bald spots, or you want healthier, longer hair this is a must have product for all ages and all ethnic groups.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and thickness. Use very little especially when you have a weave installed.  I have seen no growth to be honest</li>
    <li> I liked this product, but I didn&#x27;t really see any difference between it and regular cold-pressed castor oil (which is cheaper). The smell was a bit too strong for my taste.</li>
    <li> It was a great product. I satisfied every need I bought it for. It worked on hair growth, and soothing the scalp.</li>
    <li> I like this product alot it has helped me when I was in need of feeling better.  I tried the smaller bottle first and it went quickly.  Now I have the 8 oz. size and I still have quite a bit left. I have also used it on my eyelashes and I do see improvement.</li>
    <li> I love this product; I&#x27;ve noticed my hair has not been breaking off like it use too. I love this stuff...well worth it!!!</li>
    <li> Used as recommended but it agitated my skin. It smells kind of bad (more earthy than fishy), but that smell is faint and goes away fairly quickly. I attempted to get a refund but was directed to cover return shipping myself, and the return shipping was cost-prohibitive so I&#x27;m stuck with a useless bottle of relatively expensive fish oil (or snake oil if you prefer the term).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed a lot of satisfied customers, which is really terrific, but regretfully I am not one of them. I cannot recommend this seller or this product.</li>
    <li> Great product. Came on time and seeing visible results</li>
    <li> Purchased this item because of the great reviews. Unfortunately, my hair did not like it. I experience some discomfort in my scalp and discontinued usage early on.  I did not over use the product so that was not the issue.  Some things just work better for some people. This item just did not agree with me but it may work for you.</li>
    <li> Best Stuff On Earth for head to toe natural body care.</li>
    <li> Good product. I use it for hot oil treatment and add it to henna when I dye my hair. Keeps my hair moisturized.</li>
    <li> This product is all my aunty used on my hair growing up. I have been&lt;br /&gt;using it on my children&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;hair. Their hair has gotten fuller abd softer. The results I expected. Will reorder&lt;br /&gt;using</li>
    <li> Make thin edges grow.</li>
    <li> This is a must hair product.  really help your hair to grow</li>
    <li> This is great oil.  M second time ordering.</li>
    <li> I have never used this product for anything else other than my hair. I bought this product and the Cantu Shea Butter for the first time. At first when I experienced itching just 2 days after washing my hair (my hair takes a week and a half after I wash my hair before it starts to itch). But then I used the moisturizer without the Jamaican Castor Oil and it was fine. The next day I added the oil and within a day my hair started itching. It is not a bad product - my scalp is just allergic to it. So from my own experience, of all the the castor oils I used from different brands, this one is the worst which is why I give it a 2.</li>
    <li> I really really enjoy using this to seal my hair. Its nice and thick and great for courser textured hair.</li>
    <li> It works!!! I recommend to any one. The progress is undeniable. I will most certainly be buying more. Thank you</li>
    <li> Seriously a holy grail for every beauty need you can imagine.</li>
    <li> I am a female Asian in early 30. I have thin hair with balded spots for about 5 years. Desperately I was looking for a solution. The JBCO has so many good reviews that I thought to myself I should give it a shot. I have applied the oil slightly on my scalp (needed treatment areas) twice at night. And there...terrible fungus on my hair. Maybe dandruff. I even have more shredding than before because of these fungus. Awful experience with JBCO! Please be cautious!</li>
    <li> Product seems good for the hair. The smell isn&#x27;t great, however.  Delivery took about a week because this product isn&#x27;t a part of Prime.  I would order from them again.</li>
    <li> I received this product and it is awesome. It keeps my hair soft and has stimulated growth where hair was lost. Its a great product for naturals!</li>
    <li> Thank You I will be ordering again</li>
    <li> Love this product fast shipping</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS ALL NATURAL. GOOD FOR BODY AND HAIR  MIXED WITH OLIVE OIL   TO CUT THE THICKNESS. FOR THICK HAIR LIKE MINES YOU DON&#x27;T NEED ALOT   IF I WOULD HAVE KNOWN IT WAS THICK MAYBE I WOULD NOT  HAVE BROUGHT IT.BUT I   AM SATISFIED ,WILL BUY AGAIN ALSO GOOD FOR DRY SKIN.</li>
    <li> The best Castor Oil ever!!! I will most definite order again. Unrefined oils are so much better than processed stuff!!! Great product!</li>
    <li> I researched months and spents $100s of dollars. I have heard and read different stories and got the \\&quot;right now\\&quot; results of products, and got nothing when I tried them. this product was THE ONLY PRODUCT that had GREAT RATINGS and a SLEW of BEFORE and AFTER photos. There are people doing challenges all over youtube, and with great results. Don&#x27;t sleep on this ole skool remedy if you want some nice hair. I ordered everything! I applied the JBCO immediately to my daughter&#x27;s hair and mine when it came yesterday. It seems like it would have your hair weighed down and SUPER greasy, but it actually was a light oil. I kept touching mine and my daughter&#x27;s hair to make sure it was still there and it was. I mixed it with a little grapeseed oil and jojoba oil. Anyone who knows when you oil your hair it can go through your headscarf and get on pillows and everything else. Not this stuff. Looking forward to the results, and future purchases. Only thing I did not like was the shipping time. I was feenin&#x27; to start because of all the great reviews.</li>
    <li> Hey everyone I just ordered this item recently on a Saturday which was 9/7/13. And I&#x27;m going to start off with a 5 star rating just for the hype. I am going to do a hair growth challenge, and I will be using this castor oil and I will be using their pimento oil. I am natural and have very kinky/coily hair ranging from 3&#x27;s to the 4&#x27;s. I my hair is a decent length...but shrinkage is a betch, but sometimes I love it. I just want my hair to be at my shoulders but curly with shrinkage and all. My hair grows on average 1/2 inch a month or a little over depending on protective styles. I notice that my hair does well when I keep my hair in twist under a wig haha. So I will be wearing wigs, for my challenge. I&#x27;m also going to try to come up with a routine for me to do and follow. I have never been on a regiment for my hair. I really like simple. But I also wanted to incorporate oils into my new regiment. Never done it before, but I think that will change the health of my hair in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Routine:&lt;br /&gt;Wash hair every week&lt;br /&gt;  hot oil treatment(olive oil)&lt;br /&gt;  deep conditioning/protein treatment(egg mixed with deep conditioner)&lt;br /&gt;Split my hair into sections&lt;br /&gt;Apply castor/pimento oil to scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Detangle each section&lt;br /&gt;Twist each section&lt;br /&gt;Put wig cap on and wig&lt;br /&gt;Then repeat every week&lt;br /&gt;Throughout the week I will be applying the castor/pimento oil to my scalp where I have the plaited sections from my twist every night and sleep with a silk bonnet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Length Checks: Will be every month. Right now my hair ranges to 9&#x27;-9 1/2&#x27; all over my head, but I will do official checks to have a clear starting point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goals: Want softer/stronger/healthier hair, and I want to maximize hair growth. I want to have grown/retained 6 inches in 6 months. And that would be perfect for Spring break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be making future YouTube videos, and when I do will give the links. But you can also find me on instagram: AshleyNicoleCollins to see pictures of me and my wigs(protective styles)If you have any questions also you can contact me there. And I may make a separate instagram just for this challenge, and when/if I do I will let you guys know.to see pictures of me and my wigs(protective styles)If you have any questions also you can contact me there.

    <li> I bought this oil  due to the reviews that said it is helpful for promoting hair growth. I have a spot in the center of my head where the hair NEVER grows. Its very short and corse. It took 5 years before my locks were able to grow in this spot and then the hair started to thin and I had about 7 locks break off. For the last year I have been trying to find something to get the hair to grow back. I found out about this oil while researching coconut oil. I have now been using this oil for about a month along with biotin to get my hair to grow. I apply only to my scalp (I find it spreads easier when my hair is damp and I use less oil). I have locks and do not recommend using this all over without at least diluting it with a carrier oil first.The smell is not too bad in my opinion and I love the fact that it absorbs will. I can apply and then lay down on a pillow without leaving \\&quot;grease spots\\&quot;.I am very happy to say I have about 10 new baby locks, my new growth is a lot softer and healither, but no change in my problem spot. I am going to continue use and maybe in about a year I will have some new locks in my problem spot.</li>
    <li> This product really works, I used it on the edges of my head and hair begin to grow back and thick. I love this product!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this castor oil to promote hair growth.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant hair growth while using it.  I heard a lot of good things on YouTube about it, so I tried it.  My sister has been using it for a year and she isn&#x27;t really happy with her results.  I plan to finish the bottle.  My hair is growing, but I can&#x27;t determine if it is the castor oil or a combination of a lot of different products and vitamins.  God bless all of us naturals in our hair growth journey.</li>
    <li> I kept hearing people rave about this product but was hesitant to try it since the regular castor oil made my hair dryer than before. However, I finally decided to give it a try after a friend of mine recommended it. I had see the difference in her hair and decided to give it a try. From the first day of using this product, I have had a steady decrease in scalp and hair dryness. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I tried this product because I heard so may positive reviews from those who have gone back to natural and for hair growth.  I have only been using for 2-3 week and just today 09/23/2013,  I was like WOW my hair seems really thick this morining after washing.  So I guess this product really works. I mix this oil in my everyday hair treatment with shea butter, EVOO, and jojoba oil... I also use when I do twistouts.</li>
    <li> Wanted to like this so much because of all the great reviews, after 2 days of use my skin broke out with cystic like acne. Still sitting in my closet. My hair is now soft, growing and healthiest it&#x27;s been years because I found the right products that works for me. Avlon Affirm 5 in 1 Reconstructor, Mizani Moisturfusion Milk Bath Shampoo &amp; Mizani Moisturfusion Silk Cream Conditioner</li>
    <li> I wear my hair natural and I&#x27;ve added this product to my hair care regimen and my hair is less dry and appears shiny and healthy. I also use it on my skin to combat dryness.</li>
    <li> This product is very good it thickens your hair and gives a shine. This product smells like something is burning or was burnt like smoke, but that&#x27;s the price of beauty. I would let my husband buy this product again it is awesome and its a MUST in any hair regiment.</li>
    <li> The product was recommended to me for hair growth around the hairline.  Just got the product.  It is thick, so you only need to apply a little.  I gave it 3 stars because it will take some time to see if it helps with hairline growth.</li>
    <li> Listen. I have been using this product for 2.5yrs and absolutely love it. I massage into my scalp and my hair has grown so much and has become extremely thick. Anyone looking to get their hair back on the right track should give this product a try and I definitely recommend this seller. My oil came very quickly.</li>
    <li> This stuff is thick as molasses but evidently my hair NEEDED the nourishment.  I swear, my eyelashes are growing too:)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying 2 jars next time.</li>
    <li> JUST STARTED USING IT BUT SO FAR IT HAS BEEN GREAT FOR MY HAIR AND I DO PLAN ON ORDERING MORE OF THIS SAME PRODUCT IN THE FUTURE!</li>
    <li> I place on my feet with socks at bedtime my feet are so soft I started placing a little on my eyebrows I can&#x27;t believe it but my eyebrows are looking thicker</li>
    <li> Best product to grow my hair</li>
    <li> The product is great. I used it a lot for the beginning portion of my hair growth journey and I believe it helped me to retain hair and prevent breakage. Shipped promptly and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> The reason I rate this item a 3 star rating is because after 3 weeks of using it, I can see a change in the thicken of my hair, so at this moment I am please with it.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping, A++</li>
    <li> I have 4a natural coily strands.  I been natural over 20 years, but I had dreadlocks. In august I removed my locks and starting wearing a natural two strand twisted out fro.  I heard so many good things about JBCO, I had to buy a bottle.  I been using it for a month now, and see the thickness in my hair.  I sealed my ends after twisting my hair, I put 1 tablespoon in my conditioner, because I co-washing every Sunday.  I put a tablespoon in my body wash, and yes my skin is smoother.  I use it every other day on my edges, to keep them thick  when I was a perm head my edges were thin  Also, I massage my husband scalp once a week, he suffers with dry scalp, and he see a big difference.  Much more shine and less itchy scalp.  Yes it has a weird smell, but it goes away quickly. I will buy a bottle again soon.  Also a little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t be heavy handed.</li>
    <li> Great quality, but doesn&#x27;t really grow your hair, I love it anyways.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Bought it to help with my thinning edges around my temple areas and it works great. Before then, I could not wear a ponytail. Also works great with keeping my hair soft as I went natural in May 2014.</li>
    <li> Love this oil for my hair care retain and it did help my hair to grow faster and kept it from breaking off during the winter. Its a very good heavy oil for my hair because its thick and curly.</li>
    <li> I love this oil it really thick and heavy and not a fan of the smell BUT it really has help my hair thicken up new growth especially  so its a keeper</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  I have very fine, thin wavy hair and this is THE best conditioning treatment hands down and I&#x27;ve tried just about everything.  Just rub a generous portion into your scalp and then work it through your hair....wrap with a cotton scarf and either leave it in overnight or for a few hours and wash out.  This castor oil actually washes out very easily with a regular mild shampoo and leaves my hair stronger, shinier and just healthier. Regular castor oil sits like glue on your scalp and is VERY difficult to wash out in comparison.  The smell is a little like burned nuts but very mild and tolerable.  This is really cost effective and the most effective hair treatment I&#x27;ve ever come across. LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used JBCO on my hairline off and on for a full year and have had wonderful results. My hairline was damaged 10 years ago after a bad dye job and has since never fully recovered. I started using JBCO in August 2010 and was able to see a noticeable difference in the thickness of my hairline within 6 months. A year later my hairline has grown in considerably. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me</li>
    <li> I bought the Jamaican black castor oil for my mom to help her edges grow, although she doesn&#x27;t use it all the time she has noticed growth, I have also tried it...use it on my eyebrows because they are very short and I have seen growth also...The only downside is that it is a little pricey....Smell isn&#x27;t bad though.</li>
    <li> Really like this product. Use it on my daughters hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product for my natural hair care.</li>
    <li> Works good on my hair.</li>
    <li> Thank you for this product. It came fast and it is doing a great job on my hair. My dry flakes are gone. The smell is a little funky but when I put it on my hair at night, by morning, the smell is gone and it doesn&#x27;t absorb into my pillows. Great product. Would definitely purchase from you again.</li>
    <li> It gives my hair the softness I crave. I have 4c coarse hair. I have tried other oils, just don&#x27;t work as great as this. I use it as my base oil for LOC method and it just works. I had to get used to the smell and now it does not bother me much since I do apply other smelling good products in my hair. guys try it</li>
    <li> OK, but not really helping to re-grow hair</li>
    <li> Done my bottle. Now I mix with rosemary oil and I am starting to see a bit more hair growth on my edges. Still waiting. I use all over head.</li>
    <li> Although it says 8oz and shows you an 8 oz bottle, I received two 4oz bottles instead, I&#x27;m pointing this out because some of you might like the fact that it is in two separate bottles or maybe not. As for the oil I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working yet. But I&#x27;ll update.</li>
    <li> I Iike this product and I have seen results since I started using it.</li>
    <li> I thought that this was just another gimmick. This works for me. I thought that my sides were a lost cause, so I did some research and  found this product worked for me. I saw hair within 3 weeks and I was happy! Some say the smell is like burnt tar and it&#x27;s strong. This is not true. Some of the ladies just have a heightened sense of smell. Once you apply this to your hair, it is barely noticeable. My hair was soft and manageable. I have fine afro-american hair and it constantly craves moisture. This product has made my hair happy and has practically stopped the breakage.  I even sent my sister some in Chicago!</li>
    <li> Great product. Love it for my edges but great for the entire hair process . I had problems with my edges no longer do!!!</li>
    <li> Its thick, has no smell, and great for my hair, I have been using it for ten months now, and my hair is growing fast and looking very healthy and feeling thick!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the product. It was reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Omg this made my hair grow fast. But still haven&#x27;t grown my hair spot</li>
    <li> I see signs of improvement as far as hair growth</li>
    <li> This product met my expectations and arrived pretty quickly.  Thnx</li>
    <li> I bought this to use in my natural hair to help add some moisture, but mostly for my edges and middle of my head where hair is shorter there. It is suppose to stimulate hair growth and has definitely helped. Definitely can be heavy as it is a thick product so less is more with this product.</li>
    <li> Love it!.  It healed an old scar on my leg and other marks have completely disappeared.  Also great for rashes, insect bites and cold sores, heals quickly.</li>
    <li> My mom asked me to get this for her and she loved it. Her hair is thinning badly. She is over 80 yrs old. She says it thickened her hair.</li>
    <li> This should be called Miracle Oil! I love it. My hair and edges are thicker, healthier and fuller than it ever has been. Forget the chemicals use this oil.</li>
    <li> Awesome helps your hair grown.</li>
    <li> This is the best! I am still using this oil with excellent results.</li>
    <li> Really amazing product saw dramatic results the first two weeks of using the oil however a bit heavy but definitely worth the results!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but smells bad.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!!!! :D It&#x27;s just slightly thick and the smell isn&#x27;t amazing, but it does its job!!!!</li>
    <li> I loved it&#x27;s great , I use it with coconut oil before shower for an hour</li>
    <li> This product is my holy grail, I use it on a daily and love that I can always&lt;br /&gt;buy it from Amazon&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> really growing my edges ...I .add to shampoo .and conditioner also do .hot oil treatment with wgo will continue to buy</li>
    <li> it thickens my hair. i&#x27;m trying to regrow my hair line. I put it on in the morning and sometimes mix it with a little coconut oil to rid of the smell. I would recommend this product but i would look into your diet which plays a part for those who&#x27;re trying to grow your hair at a faster rate. I love it on my skin!! it make your skin smoothness and a little glow</li>
    <li> I love black castor oil.  This product has a weird smell so for that reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> It had caused my hair to fall out and break off I absolutely  don&#x27;t care for it wish it woulda help my hair not break it !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product works miracles</li>
    <li> Being African American this oil really works. I did the big chop March 11,2015 now it done got so thick nd grew from the product. It really works.</li>
    <li> Arrived safe, in good shape.</li>
    <li> I REALLY LOVE THIS STUFF,, NOW I NEED TO JUST USE IT MORE LOL</li>
    <li> It worked well.  Kept my hair moist.  The growth is slow.  I think I would have gotten the same result with a regular hair moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I use this oil for my hair. My edges and nape had been thinning due to tight hairstyles and too much braiding. this oil made my hair grow back, and also thickened my hair overall as well. it&#x27;s not an over night fix, but it works well with frequent use. yes the smell is strong, but a few drops of an essential oil of your choice ( i use lemon grass and lavender)  solves that. i also love that a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> This product has helped my edges tremendously. I use it every night even my husband noticed a difference on my edges, will be ordering my third bottle.</li>
    <li> Started using ony eyelashes and after about 3 weeks I could already tell the difference.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product for coarse natural hair.  Why? It will soften it.  It is about the best natural oil for natural, coarse, type 4 hair, that will really soften it.  I mix it with other, lighter oils.  By itself, it would be too heavy.  But if you mix it with other oils, with it being the dominant ingredient of course, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Well it takes a few weeks for this oil to work actually. But so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very excited.</li>
    <li> So I bought this after doing a search on natural hair growth.  No idea if it works.  I can tell my hair is softer when I use it.  I guess I can update by the summer.  I use it once a week as a leave in overnight and in another recipe for a hair mask.  Here&#x27;s hoping!</li>
    <li> Does wonders. It helps if you have sensitive skin. Purchased this for my edges to grow back. They started to thin after having my son. You do have to put it on &amp; massage it in. My mom has extremely sensitive &amp; this product worked perfectly for her. I recommend!</li>
    <li> Very thick oil, which I already knew it was going be. I use it for my hair but u have to dilute it with an essential oil.... but anyways, arrived in a timely manner. Since the oil is soooo thick it does last for a VERY long time. I would say like 6months.. ish</li>
    <li> It really helps to  moisturize my hair.</li>
    <li> Patience and persistence.  Apply daily to the scalp and wait for results. I put my JBCO in a separate nozzle bottle and I mixed it with amla powder.  I use other products to moisturize the ends of my hair, and I sleep with a silk bonnet. I have experienced amazing growth results.</li>
    <li> it did.t do what it was supose to do........</li>
    <li> If u have bold area try this miricale</li>
    <li> I received JBCO within 3 days after ordering, quick arrival!.  Packaged very well.  I washed my hair, applied my leave in conditioner and used JBCO last.  The smell was not bad at all.  I applied to my scalp and hair.  I have transitioned to natural hair and koils.  My hair (koils) were extremely dry and coarse.  Now my koils are soft, shiny and holding moisture.  I am very pleased with JBCO.</li>
    <li> Great for my hair, love this..</li>
    <li> Not sure, I use it because I believe it makes a difference but does not make a major difference as far as growth. I do think that it conditions and thickens hair. Been using the same bottle for years now so that should give you a good idea of how often I use it. Off and on and not consistent enough.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle.  It is just what my bald spots needed.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product so I really don&#x27;t see any results yet.  I am happy to report that it does not have the bad smell like I&#x27;ve read about in many reviews.</li>
    <li> I use JBCO on my hair right after I wash it and seal it with shea butter. It definitely helped strengthen my hair and soften it. A little goes a looooong way especially if you mix it with other oils. I mix JBCO with olive oil, coconut oil, and tea tree oil to make it thinner. It&#x27;s amazing. Definitely would recommend for people with thin hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about  a month and I&#x27;m not seeing any results yet</li>
    <li> Love this oil. The price is great and my son now uses it on his hair.  I have 4c texture so it works really well, especially on my edges.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I use it daily in my hair</li>
    <li> Love this product. I add it to my natural hair care product line</li>
    <li> In love with this oil</li>
    <li> Great hair product. Hair has grown 2 inches and softer from this product.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping good product A+</li>
    <li> I love this product I is making my hair thicker and curls more define. I  have use it on my dark spots on my face and arm and dark spots is going away. I love love this product. I need to put another Oder in</li>
    <li> Idk if it&#x27;s supposed to smell like old cooking oil but it does. Softens my hair. Heavy but quick absorbing on my natural hair. My issue was that the seal seemed loose making me question if the product was tampered with. Also wondering if the smell indicates that it&#x27;s a little on the old inventory side.</li>
    <li> Excellent for damaged and healthy hair</li>
    <li> I honestly wish I could give this more than 5 stars.  I heard about the uses of Black Castor about a month ago.  I&#x27;ve been using it as a hair and skin oil and am really pleased with the results in both areas.  I also purchased the other brand (Sunny Isle).  And although they have the better marketing strategy.  Tropical Island has the darker oil.  It is blacker than SI and has a much stronger smell.  I&#x27;ve  been using this as a DYI oil along with the wild grow and sulfur to help restore hair breakage.  So far so good.  It&#x27;s been over two weeks, and I have new growth in areas where my hair had been thinned for decades.  I&#x27;ve already ordered two more bottles.  I don&#x27;t want to run out of this product.  Also the price and the shipping handling was much cheaper than anywhere else I found on the internet.  And I like the full 8 oz.</li>
    <li> Arrived in good time and I really like the product so far.</li>
    <li> This product is terrible.....it smells and leaves hair very greasy! Save your money and get something else.</li>
    <li> It Does Thicken Your Hair And Make Your Hair Grow Faster</li>
    <li> When I purchased this stuff I was slightly nervous that it would cause my hair to break, but I needed something very moisturizing because I had got my 3b bra strap length hair braided into to box braids and I wanted something that would help with hair growth and retaining moisture. This definitely did the trick, when I took my hair down I instantly notice that my hair felt softer and it had also grown about and inch. I love this stuff so much I purchased another bottle, as well as the detangler, shampoo, conditioner, and the pimento growth oil. Hopefully, they help with my journey to waist lenght hair.</li>
    <li> Live what this is doing for my hair!! I heard that it did wonders and it&#x27;s true. I like to put a good amount on my scalp and give myself a hot oil treatment before I shampoo. Great for edges that need a little help! Those grandmas were right when they swore by black castor oil!</li>
    <li> I love this oil. My hair feels so soft and smoooth. When I blow dry my hair, My hair is dry as a bone. I always slap a lot of moisturizer before i blow dry it and its still dry . Well this time i put the oil in my hair while it was wet. Blow dry it and wow my hair was still moist after i blow dry it. My hair felt so good and moisturze. This oil is great. I also put it on my eyelashes. It grew :) So I recommand this product for the hair and eyelashes. Its thick oil so don&#x27;t need to put a whole lot in your hair or scalp or eyelashes. This bottle will last you awhile. :-)</li>
    <li> My hairline has always suffered when I&#x27;m stressed, add to that I&#x27;ve been loced for over 4 years and I usually wear my hair back in a ponytail.  Long story short I started noticing my hairline was not only back farther than[[ASIN:B003CTTZQQ Jamaican Black Castor Oil 8oz]] it used to be but I had some areas in my head that the hair was almost non-existent.  I did research on youtube and the internet and most of the people recommended castor oil.  I had the Home Health cold-pressed at home already and tried that for about two weeks.  It itched plus it looked like my hair was getting even thinner!  So I ordered the JBCO plain from Amazon and Flex Commerce.  I&#x27;ve used it for two weeks and my hairline already looks better, my locs are softer and when I brush a little along my hairline and tie it down with a silk scarf it lays the edges down and I don&#x27;t have to gel them!  Which is a win-win for me because gels are so drying.  The smell is like burnt coffee but doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  I didn&#x27;t get the lavender one because I wanted the oil in its purest form.  The first time I used it I added a little lavender EO of my own but after that I just didn&#x27;t feel it was necessary.  I also use it on my eyebrows to overcome over thinning that I&#x27;ve done and they are filling in great as well.  I highly recommend this oil and let me add that my hair is color-treated and the JBCO has not had any effect on the color.</li>
    <li> I have been transitioning from relaxers for the past year. I went a few months without using this product &amp; realize very quickly I will never do that again. I mix it with EVOO &amp; sometimes coconut oil &amp; sulfur. My hair loves it. Keeps my hair soft &amp; moisturized. My hair is coarse, so it soaks up grease like a sponge &amp; is left dry within a few hrs. But this solves that problem. I apply every 2-3 days with application bottle.</li>
    <li> Does work. Smell is not that great but the product lasts really long!</li>
    <li> Like I said it works but give it time... if it didn&#x27;t work I wouldn&#x27;t had placed another order for two more bottles and take in the fact the price makes it even more better. Since using it I&#x27;ve used in my daughter&#x27;s hair and passed it on to my mother and also recommaned this product to friends..FYI purchase the product from here why their fast with your delivery, and the price is also nice reason concerning the price your wasting to time and money buying from a beauty salon...</li>
    <li> This works wonders! I&#x27;ve been using it for 12 days, and my skin feels so smooth, and my hair feels thicker and it seems to be growing a lot! It&#x27;s a great moisturizer for both hair and skin. I will definitely be buying some more once this runs out!</li>
    <li> I just got my bottle of  JBCO I already gave it a five star just for arriving so fast and also for the protective packaging I hope this helps my hair become thicker. This oil is very thick compare to almond oil and olive oil&lt;br /&gt;I am use to using I was wondering if anybody knows if it will be just as effective if I mix it with either almond oil or olive oil..even mustard oil since they say that mustard oil is also good for hair growth. If anybody knows if it will be OK to mix with any of those 3 oils so its not to thick  please leave a comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****AFTER A WEEK OF REGULAR USE (4-5 TIMES) IAM HOOKED ON THIS IT DOES MAKE YOUR HAIR THICKER AND FILLS YOUR HAIR LINE I LOVE IT AND WILL NOT BE WITH OUT EVER I MIX IT WITH ALMOND/OLIVE OIL AND LEAVE OVERNIGHT....</li>
    <li> I love using this product on my scalp ,it does wonders for the hair .</li>
    <li> fantastic product it really helps to thicken my hair better than the regular castor oil, this castor oil WORKS IT HELPS TO GROW HAIR BUT YOU NEED TO GIVE IT TIME TO WORK, i saw results in about 3-4 months my new growth grow out thicker. It is thick so abit hard to use on its own so i mix it with a carrier oil like extra virgin olive oil or coconut oil, i massage it in my scalp at nights and also to seal after i moisturize, i love it.</li>
    <li> This is a good oil. It works. My edges are getting thicker from my old stylist braiding my hair too tight. I just wanted to warn everyone not to order the oil from the website. Order it from amazon. I ordered some products directly from the website and my order was missing some things. I contacted them several times and they never returned my calls. I reported them to the Better Business Bureau. That didnt help anything either because apparently they have a reputation for poor customer service. This is a great oil, just stay away from the company website.</li>
    <li> Watch Video Below for the use of Tropic Isle Living&#x27;s Oils that are great for Massage Therapy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;_EUJ-W7-38I</li>
    <li> This oil is thick and sticky, as the castor oil should be. I have not seen the result yet but I am very hopeful this is going to work for my hair. Bottle should have a pump for easy handling.</li>
    <li> It wrks,light on scalp use enough to grease scalp. I like it but u cnt knock it till u try it</li>
    <li> For starters, I was extremely excited when my online search for a product to help thicken hair, fill in thin spots, and grow hair quickly, led me to Jamaican Black Castor Oil.  After breathing a sigh of relief and ordering on Amazon, I waited, impatiently, for the product to be delivered.  Upon arrival, I dashed in the house to apply Jamaican Black Castor Oil to my hair.  \\&quot;The sooner I start treating my hair,\\&quot; I thought, \\&quot;the faster the results.\\&quot;  Upon opening the bottle, I immediately noticed the woodsy smell.  \\&quot;So, the smell is a little outdoorsy.  If all the hype, accolades, and testimonies are true, it&#x27;ll be well worth it.  And, it&#x27;s a small price to pay for miraculous results.\\&quot;  Little did I know, the price would be extensively beyond what I could afford or was willing to pay.  Well, after about one week into using the product, I noticed my head itched profusely especially in the areas where I applied extra for more bountiful results, a top spot in my head where my hair was thin.  \\&quot;Itching? That&#x27;s good, right?  Oh yeah!  It&#x27;s definitely working!  I mean, my leg muscles itch after a strenuous workout.  And, the results are always positive.\\&quot;  Not so.  About after week two, my natural but course hair, which I love, was smooth to the touch, and easier to manage.  It was so smooth I couldn&#x27;t stop touching it, especially in the top spot which was thin.  But as I fingered through my now smooth hair, I noticed my hair appeared to be shedding.  I thought, \\&quot;It&#x27;s just a part of the natural shedding that hair does daily.\\&quot;  Wrong again!  Well into the end of week three, the thin section in the top of my head felt extremely thin. So, I decide to take a look and see exactly what was happening up there.  Much to my astonishment, what I saw was nothing!  My once THIN spot was now a BALD spot.  The Jamaican Black Castor Oil had caused my hair in that section to break off, leaving a bald spot.  Now, it wasn&#x27;t baby&#x27;s bottom smooth bald.  But, it appeared as though someone had given me a buzz cut in this one spot alone.  Long story short, I&#x27;m now resigned to wearing baseball caps and head wraps until the spot in my hair grows back.  Everything that glitters ain&#x27;t gold.</li>
    <li> Great product. It is really helping my hair get fuller. Will repurchase when it runs out and use on my scalp and edges.</li>
    <li> Its okay.. im not in love with it like all youtubers are. i will be purchasing again though just to be sure lol</li>
    <li> One of the best moisturizers that I have used.  I use it on my scalp and rub it in.  It soothes my scalp and keeps way those dry flakes. I also use it as a hot oil treatment, or I mix it with coconut oil to thin it out some.  The smell does not bother me.  After I do a good wash, I sometimes add it to my conditioner.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast for this product. As far as the product, I&#x27;m natural but had trouble with my hair being dry and feeling too coarse. I tried this after reading several and after a month of usage it makes my hair feel soft and moisturised.  My mom who has a relaxer says she sees positive results from use as far as growth around her hairline (edges).</li>
    <li> OMG this oil is so thick I love it, I put it on my edges at night to keep them thick and healthy I have even started putting it on my daughters hair now that I see it is safe and doesn&#x27;t break me out.A little def goes a long way I will have this bottle a long time, can&#x27;t wait for her edges to come in as thick as mine.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on a Thursday evening and I believe that it arrived Tuesday morning all the way from New York.  The oil is very thick with a burnt wood smell which is probably the only con although it does go away.  I mix it with coconut oil so it will come out of my applicator bottle easier seeing how it really is super thick.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for about 2 mths. The edges of my hair are really growing, the product is awesome. I will be doing a video on YouTube in about four months, showing the beginning to end of my 6 mths of using the product. Hope this was a little helpful😃 and I only rated this product as a 3 because I always give myself 6mths to review and test products.</li>
    <li> I live by this product . My hair was thinning and breaking off but this has gotten my hair sooooo healthy. It does smell wierd tho...but worth it</li>
    <li> As my title suggests, I love this product.  It is great for both relaxed and natural people when used to moisturize hair and seal the ends.  I found great benefits from pouring it in my hands and then running my hands through my relaxed hair. My hair would always end up super soft and luxurious feeling no matter what other shampoo or conditioner I used with it. I have found similar results after going natural but not as dramatic as when I was relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think where some people run into trouble is when they apply this product directly to their scalp. I would strongly advise against that. I do not have a sensitive scalp but when I placed this product on my scalp, I experienced terrible itching and raised bumps all over my head. Further research showed that others also experienced this. The itching and the bumps did not go away after one wash. It took maybe two washes for the symptoms to subside. I did, however and unfortunately, notice more growth around my edges where I was using the product on my scalp. I just felt in the end that the pain was not worth it. If you really want to try it on your scalp (because I do know at least one person for whom this product did not cause a negative reaction), I would use the spot treatment method. Apply it to one spot on your scalp and note if you feel any different. Then wait until the next morning before trying it elsewhere on your scalp. I always felt it by the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With regard to nature of the product itself, firstly,  it does not have a strong smell. It&#x27;s a bit musky and smells like something a man would wear but that smell goes away very quickly. I am very sensitive to product odors so this really would have bothered me if it was really bad. In addition, the oil is very thick and it is almost clear in appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite my negative reaction to it when using it directly on my scalp, I will keep using it because it is a great moisturizer for my hair strands. And though I will not use it onmy scalp, I acknowledge that it may work for others who are not sensitive to it. Good luck!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s thick but smells amazing. Use sparingly because as I said- it&#x27;s thick. Has made my hair thicker and softer. I was almost bald around my edges but its filling in nicely. I will buy this over and over again!</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil because I read online that it was supposed to be helpful with thinning hair and overall hair growth. I used it daily for a couple of weeks on my thinning hair areas and it actually started making them thinner! It made my thin spot in the front practically bald so I stopped using it immediately! I&#x27;m hoping to find another use for it since there is so much of it left, but I will never ever use it on my hair or scalp again.</li>
    <li> Awesome!! Got a lot of product for a wonderful price!!</li>
    <li> Product seems authentic, however, the plastic seal on bottle top was not - it was only attached to the lid and not bottle so lid just pulled right off. I was reluctant to use it for this reason.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend, I&#x27;ve noticed a difference</li>
    <li> Smells funny but I think it&#x27;s just me. I mixed it with another oil.</li>
    <li> Makes my thick hair tame and soft, and does the same for my beard. Love this stuff, use it every day. I think I&#x27;ve even notice more hair growth recently, too.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It works well on my hair!</li>
    <li> Very nice, makes hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> I love Jamaican black caster it really work we&#x27;ll on my hair</li>
    <li> This product works great and it was delivered really quickly.</li>
    <li> I thought this was suppose to help with hair regrowth, the only thing it has done for me was to make my hair oily</li>
    <li> My edges are growing back!  Looks like progress to me! Though I am using a combination of products, I am happy with this individual item because it seems to be aiding in keeping my scalp hydrated and my hair soft.</li>
    <li> Does everything it says it does was pleased with the product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good for  wound&#x27;s treatment. I&#x27;ve bought this oil for hair ( I&#x27;ve lost a lot ).No result yet,probably need more time.</li>
    <li> This is a great item. Lots of product. The shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> the listing was very accurate :) no problems with the seller or the accuracy of the description of the product shipped. the only thing is: the smell!!!! had no idea it would be so smokey. not a nice smell but not an unbearable smell (i still used it!! haha) but just make sure i use it when i know im not going out in public i.e. going to bed, or staying in the house all day. not sure if its helped yet only been a few weeks but the oil is very thick and i imagine it is helping to get to the core of the hair :)like all of the other reviews ahve said a little goes a long way- so i use a q-tip instead of trying to pour it in my hands it was be a bit much beware before you turn it upside down!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH!! and the shipping was amazingly fast! it literally felt like i had just ordered it last night when i found it in my mailbox! yay</li>
    <li> its been several weeks and i&#x27;m still waiting on results! i&#x27;ll keep at it since the reviews and testimonials were SO positive. my sister is using it since cutting her hair to its natural state and she&#x27;s been seeing great results. my hair is long but very thin and naturally curly. wanted to use it to aid my thinning hair line...keeping fingers crossed!</li>
    <li> This is a great product!</li>
    <li> Very good price, very thick only need to use very little.,</li>
    <li> Too greasy! I feel my hair comes off more after using this because it stifles it</li>
    <li> I like this product and it does what its says. You do have to put very little on or else hair is too oiley. I would recommend</li>
    <li> I was unable to try out the castor oil because the bottle was broken when I received it but I am giving them 5 stars because they fixed the problem immediately! The customer service is great.</li>
    <li> arrived extremely early. well packaged. The smell isn&#x27;t as bad as ppl make it seem.its not even a strong smell. i use it on my hair and it just soaks it up!</li>
    <li> i love JBCO it really moisturizes my hair, its natural and my hair hasn&#x27;t been healthier! Ill use it for the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> I love jamaican Black Castor Oil! I use it when I get a fresh scar(disappears in days), to lengthen my eyelashes(yes it really does make your hair grow thicker and longer so dont put it on your chin if it sprouts hair :)), to keep my scalp moisturised(put it in every 3 days), it has lasted for a year and a month so a good investment, I use it to take my dark circles away from under my eyes, to fade old scars and even moisturise my feet. I recommend this multi purpose oil to everyone. I suggest doing research on it so you can see the benefits before purchasing but you wont be sorry!</li>
    <li> This was my second purchase of JBCO and i like it despite the smell, I have seen a change in my hair.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me, that does not mean it doesn&#x27;t do what is says it does it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Use to see if it will help with my husbands hair growth.  I also use it some for moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I do like this. it has a smokey smell to it but you get over it. what i do is take a small amount. because a small amount goes a long way. i microwave it on a 19 secs or so then i grease my scalp with it. i&#x27;ve had it for a month and it&#x27;s good for my hair. I have seen more thickness. no lenght yet. just thicker roots. i am natrual so my fro is imporant. it will help with well defined bantu knots as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other types of castor oil, but there is definitely a differece between refined castor oil and this all natural type. This is thicker, has a deep golden color and is much more effective for my hair growth. I put this in a nose tip bottle and mix it with peppermint and rosemary essential oil for my scalp massages and deep conditioning treatments. It makes my scalp feel amazing. Also, I apply a small amount prior to blowing my hair dry or flat-ironing it. My hair never breaks anymore. The price of this oil is steep, but I find that it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a great oil. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and my husband see a difference.  I really don&#x27;t so I guess it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this stuff! i use it in my hair once a week and i have seen awesome results! my hair has grown longer and thicker!</li>
    <li> I favor this over regular castor oil. I think it is more effective and a better oil in general</li>
    <li> A+A+A+A+A+  Great product</li>
    <li> Great product, really really works. Got this for someone and its growing their hair back. Their edges were gone but now they r growing in. I&#x60;m glad we gave it a try. I recommend this to anyone trying to grow their hair back.</li>
    <li> Smells bad can&#x27;t stand it.</li>
    <li> Great stuff got my hair feeling rehydrated and moisturized. Beware it smells like stir fry food I am not exaggerating but hey I like Asian cuisine hahaha. Can&#x27;t wait to see the long term effects.</li>
    <li> I received my product in timeline they said. Have never used this product before, but was recommended by a friend. But excited to try it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and already see a difference in my hair health. Great to use as a pre poo.</li>
    <li> It works wonders.I must say that my hair is growing,</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, you use it for your hair and your face.</li>
    <li> Love dealing with Rob from Lady T Sundries. I was having delivery issues with the mail carrier and Rob continued helping me until I received my product.</li>
    <li> Excellent, Came on time, I needed it!</li>
    <li> Just wonderful will recommend!!! make your skin feel like silk....</li>
    <li> Great stuff&lt;br /&gt;Time to reorder lol</li>
    <li> This product keeps my hair from being frizzy. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I originally bought Jamican Black Castor Oil for my natural hair. However, my husband was going bald and was having a difficult time dealing with it. When he shampoo&#x27;d his hair there was hair all in the shower. I started applying the product on his scalp (hair type thick curly/weavy texture) I noticed about a couple of weeks his hair started growing in. I am now buying more because his hair is now almost fully grown back. I love this product!!!!![[ASIN:B003CTTZQQ Jamaican Black Castor Oil 8oz]]</li>
    <li> I only gave this oil 3 stars because I didn&#x27;t really see any major improvement in my hair.  My hair is already very thick and my hair strands didn&#x27;t become thicker from using it.  I was just using it on my ends by itself, I didn&#x27;t know I had to use a moisturizer and then seal with an oil.  It didn&#x27;t prevent me from getting split ends, but then again maybe my ends where already damaged and needed a trim.  What I had left in the bottle I started putting it in my shea butter mixture.  I ordered another bottle so I could continue putting it in my mixture, but unfortunately because it is in a glass it broke.  I won&#x27;t be repurchasing this product anytime soon.</li>
    <li> Very good for sealing and scalp massages. It has a smokey scent like someone who&#x27;s been around a grill if that makes sense. It&#x27;s not runny at all and sort of resembles syrup.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love JBCO! It&#x27;s a must have for me, I use it for my hair and eyebrows. Have used it for about a year now, and I must say I have never had anything that worked for hair growth as fast as this product! You&#x27;ll notice growth after two weeks. Great on African American hair*</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I purchased this to assist with some thinning of my hair from over use of chemicals.  Placed a few drops in my daily moisturizer and my hair became thick in about a month.  In addition my hair was very soft.  A little goes a long way.  SN: The smell is a little strong but does get some getting used to.</li>
    <li> I heard a lot about this stuff so I had to try it. Let me start by saying my hair used to be dry and itchy. It came about three days after I ordered it nicely wrapped. Smells kid of like that tar grease by glovers or cigarette ashes.lol But use it at night and you&#x27;ll be fine. Nice and thick. Stops dry scalp. I love JBCO. Please don&#x27;t change anything. Every time I find a product I like they go and change it. Wild growth oil works well but it stinks and you continue to smell it all day so I stopped using it.JBCO IS THE BEST! (:[[ASIN:B003CTTZQQ Jamaican Black Castor Oil 8 Oz]]</li>
    <li> after all the rave abut it,i thought i had found my staole but it did nothing for my hair just a funny smell.it made my hair too sticky and hard to comb through so i got some breakage.i use it in my dc but thats till it runs out cos there no difference in my hair since i started using it.</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  It Revives your hair follicles to allow healthy growth. My edges were almost completely gone in patches. Now after 2 months of consistent use i see a big difference.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based off of recommendations of others and I was very disappointed.  I gave it 3 chances.  I have relaxed hair and generally hair minimal shedding. When using this product the amount if shedding increased drastically. I deceased the amount of product I used and the shedding continued. My last attempt to use the product was to place it on my ends only and I still had shedding. I gave the product 3 chances and finally gave up. I hoped for more and was optimistic at first but this product wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
    <li> Really great oil! It doesn&#x27;t smell as bad people had made it seem. However, it is a very concentrated oil, so using to much can really weigh down your hair. After experimenting with my staple oil mixture and mixing certain things, I definitely learned how to use this oil the proper way and I love it. I honestly feel like this aided to my hair growth! With my coconut oil and other oils I use in my mixture, this aided with my three plus inches of hair growth.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in a local beauty supply store just because it was an oil. I normally buy several oils and mix them in with my conditioner. About a week after using it I noticed just how soft my hair felt even with synthetic hair in my kinky twists. I then noticed I&#x27;d purchased what some call a miracle. My hair is natural kinky/curly and I have dyed my hair for years. I got the twists because I play in my hair entirely too much and wanted to let it rest. I&#x27;ve never had an issue with hair falling out no can I say this adds thickness as my hair is in twists, but I can say it has my scalp feeling amazing and lasts LONG! I don&#x27;t need to apply it everyday. It also made my hand and nails feel amazing. I will start applying it to my eyebrows as I&#x27;ve seen some women say they&#x27;ve done and seen thickness. I&#x27;ll wait a month and write another review. At that time I should be sporting my own hair and will post about both that and my eye brows!   It does smell a little like cigarette and it only bothers me when people go to hug me, especially knowing that I don&#x27;t smoke. After the first day of applying the oil, that sort of passes. Also, I only pay 10.99 for an 80 oz bottle. Yes eighty oz bottle. I&#x27;m worried some of you are being jipped by ordering online. But then again I do live in a west indian neighborhood. Either way check your beauty supply stores or ask a friend to check hers!</li>
    <li> so far good, my sister uses this product and she told me about. It&#x27;s only been a week but so far i like it.</li>
    <li> Love this product and order often. Have thicker hair now and definitely much less breakage. Does not smell the greatest.</li>
    <li> i love this product. could not wait to get it. everyone said great things about it!!! So excited i finally got it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really care for the smell, but I do think that it does make my hair a litle thicker and not too much shedding after.</li>
    <li> I used this product in my hair spritz I made after watching videos on Youtube.  I love it, so I made some for my daughters.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much. It makes my hair extremely soft and manageable. It&#x27;s perfect for adding to my deep conditioner and sealing my hair after moisturizing. I also do the castor oil challenge.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. My hair began to increase in length and thickness within 8 weeks.  My edges are thicker.  I apply quarter size amount to the thinning areas and massage in, morning and night. I have natural hair and this has worked wonders!!! I love it. I also apply the oil to my face in the evening which has thickened my eyelashes and eyebrows. I love the oil but I wish that it came in a larger bottle.</li>
    <li> Got this item for my hair, but I ended up using it for my skin and sometimes for my heartburn. Smells good even after days on hair, and the oil is thicker than I thought. It smooth my hair too.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It really helps to thicken up your hair and l like the smell too! It is not heavy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this castor oil along with emu oil to help my thin edges of my hair.  I&#x27;ve only been using a couple of weeks &amp; I do see new growth in those areas, so I will continue to use! Very pleased! It does have a smokey scent to it but its not bothersome,</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair moisturized, I haven&#x27;t seen any growth yet because I just started using it last week. I will post a new update in a month.</li>
    <li> The smell is awful but I use it at night so the smell is gone in the morning</li>
    <li> Good product[[ASIN:B003CTTZQQ Jamaican Black Castor Oil 8oz]]Arrived in a timely manner. Will be trying this on my dry locs.  Just received a week ago but I have noticed a difference in my dryness.</li>
    <li> Great servIce. Order on Monday came on Wednesday.  Helps with hair lost around the outside of the head. I see a difference. Good product!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair too heavy</li>
    <li> This is a very nice hair oil if &amp;#34;used in a proper way&amp;#34;. If this oil can be infused with a organic coconut oil and warmed a little before massaging on scalp it really works wonders !</li>
    <li> great product love it</li>
    <li> Excellent product, grew my sides after 6 months.</li>
    <li> This castor oil arrived in the mail today, and I am nothing short of amazed. Most oils barely make it to my scalp, but this went straight through my hair with little struggle. I have coarse Jewish hair, as well as a chronically itchy scalp, so it normally takes an hour+ of massaging and combing oils into my hair before they actually get where they need to go. This castor oil is more like a sap, making it easy to distribute along your scalp without losing a ton of the product in the process. The nutty smell, reminiscent of Chinese food, just adds to the experience!</li>
    <li> Love it! Arrived in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Thickens your hair still working</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF! IT IS REAL GOOD ON EDGES!</li>
    <li> I have natural 4 a/b hair that is bra strap length when flat ironed. I was looking for an oil that was heavier than olive oil and this is it!. My hair loves oils. When my hair is straight or in a rollerset I mix the jbco with some olive oil and coconut oil. But when I wear it kinky i used the jbco by it self. It make the hair soft and shiny. I was able to make my straight hair last an extra week. kept the hair soft and from shedding which happens after 10-14 days usually</li>
    <li> I seen Results in two weeks My hair is going fuller and My patches are growing here hair now .</li>
    <li> Great for natural hair.</li>
    <li> Great product. A little thick but better than mineral oil, grease, and petroleum products. Thanks a lot and will order more. Works great and makes my hair so soft.</li>
    <li> Many of the natural hair blogs rave about this product, so I decided to try it. My hair is thick and coarse and I needed a heavier oil besides coconut and olive. Honestly, the regular castor oil works better for my hair. Jamaican Black Castor is a little thick and too heavy for me. I have Afro textured natural hair (4B) and although I need something heavy this is just overpowering and leaves a dull, lackluster finish on my hair. It looks like it just sits on top. It did work better mixed with a conditioner or with other oils as a treatment, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it by itself. Since I can only use it one way I decided that was my first and last bottle.</li>
    <li> The only reason why I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the smell. It&#x27;s a great product and works well on your hair, but the smell can be a little overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I bought this product  to try in my hair really works,  washes out easy and takes the frizz away and leaves your hair soft</li>
    <li> I was extremely satisfied with this product. Although I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any major results. It really helps my hair retain moisture.</li>
    <li> Love this for my hair.  It&#x27;s consistency is thinner than the original castor oil. Plus it has many other uses.</li>
    <li> Good product it was what I expected arrives in a timely matter oil is real thick so a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for 3 weeks .. My edges having grew yet, so I&#x27;m gonna be patient and see what happends it&#x27;s just the right side of my edges😢 it does make make my hair more softer&lt;br /&gt;It had a hard smell..</li>
    <li> Smell is horrible. Not sure if I am seeing a difference in my hair. Fast shipping. No issues.</li>
    <li> Smell not the greatest which I already knew but not overwhelming..this really does work great..used to have a dry scalp and it&#x27;s stopped!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as expected. Very happy. Easy to apply and very economical for all that its worth. I would definitely recommend to others.</li>
    <li> This is great on my ends and on all my hair if used lightly. Really like the results I am seeing since using this product.</li>
    <li> I received this item on time and is item is as described. So far I am noticing a difference in my hairline. Its growing in, so im assuming if theres a difference in less than 30 days of using. This should actually do what I purchased it for... thicken my hair and grow in my hair line</li>
    <li> This did nothing more than my plain ol castor oil.  I guess I had to try it to see for myself.  It worked for the person recommending it to me, but I had no noticeable results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure sure of my rating yet, need more time to get results. I bought this item for hair growth, only had the&lt;br /&gt;product for less than a month.</li>
    <li> I have actually brought this oil about 3 months ago, but decided to wait to post my review to see how this product works. I have been transitioning for 9 months now, going from relaxed hair to natural. My hair type is 3c-4a. This oil is thick and a little goes a long way. My hair has become damaged from years of relaxing. My hair has broken off at my edges and also my hair began thinning on the top of my head.( near the middle of my head) I even had a bald spot on the side of my head which was there since I was a teenager. (pulling my hair back a lot using banana clips caused the bald spot) Since I have been using this oil my hair is growing back in my bald spot, my edges and the top of my head! This oil really works. It has also enriched the color of my hair and provides excellent moisture when used as a hot oil treatment; which I do once a week. I put the oil on my scalp every night and massage it into my scalp, then I twist my hair in two strands and wear a satin scarf to bed. In the morning I untwist my hair and have the most beautiful soft curls. It also keeps my new growth soft while I am transitioning from the relaxer. I need to say however that the smell is not very pleasant. It smells like ashes but the smell does not stay in your hair. The oil and the smell are quickly absorbed. To take the smell down a little I mix this oil with coconut oil or jojoba oil in a separate applicator squeeze bottle before applying to my scalp. This oil is also great in sealing the ends of your hair also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this oil a few weeks ago. So far I notice a significant change in the way my scalp feels, the smell isn&#x27;t too strong, and I will update on whether or not it&#x27;s helping strengthen and in turn helping my hair grow!</li>
    <li> I love this, I use it in my hair, on my skin (gotta keep those heels in shape) this is great, I also have used it as a rubbing oil for my aching feet and it does seem to help some</li>
    <li> Love it...its one of my maintainance oil, very good moisturizer and for hair growth. The smell is not offensive to me but most people consider the aroma strong so try using it before bed time. Oh yeah, the oil is not too thick so it dripples from the hair line, try to put the right quantity for your hair (you will figure this it out over time).</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen yet the result with this oil when it comes to hair growth,so I will continue using it ,I mix it with other oils because it&#x27;s thick as a hot oil treatment weekly so we will see</li>
    <li> I used it in my boys hair, my son left to spend some time with his nana, omg! The night when my boys walked in the house I was shocked, my I year old hair was longer.they are Latinos so they have growing hair, yet still it grew out alot in 2weeks.</li>
    <li> Love the product. It lasted a long time and my hair grew. I will order it again. Yes I will!</li>
    <li> Yes this is the one! Ladies and gentlemen of trying to grow your hair,  or if having problems in that department such as bald spots thinning hair this is one of the safest way to go. Not only does this castor oil help with hair it has other purposes,  that are good for use. I have a friend that lives next door to me and she has a skin condition which she had for many years,  she tried many things but had never heard of jbco. I told how it has many purposes even works well for skin and ask would she like to give it a try? She  agreed to, and since she been using it on her skin she showed me how the patches of dried flakey skin on her legs were clearer and getting better.  Now each time I get some I give her some for her skin, and she love it because its working wonderful for her skin.</li>
    <li> OMG I don&#x27;t know where to begin. I LOVE this product. It worked soooo fast on my crown I started jumping for joy. It&#x27;s thick, but I don&#x27;t mind that at all. I bought another one and will continue to buy more. Thanks Tropic Isle for making this natural product.</li>
    <li> After deciding to take the \\&quot;Castor Oil Challenge,\\&quot; I ordered this product to maximize the benefits of using castor oil on my hair daily. I must say that it absolutely was worth the challenge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since September 2013 when I started using it, I&#x27;ve seen results. My hair is softer, thicker, and more manageable. Areas that appeared thinner are now thicker. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I started using this product on my 3 year old scalp;she has little white spot on her scalp, and it totally healed it! I will recommend this item</li>
    <li> This product was way too thick for me and it  pulled my hair out. Will stick to argan oil. : /</li>
    <li> So far it is meeting the expectations we had.  However, it will take a little more time before seeing the results my wife is hoping for.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT. It works wonders</li>
    <li> Love this product!! Really excited to see results heard great things about it ! Also the shipper sent me two extra bottles to accommodate me for the long delivery. Just wanna say Thank you soo much!</li>
    <li> Really didn&#x27;t much of anything . Real disappointment. I applied it everyday for a month and saw nothing .maybe month 2 will be different but so far nothing !</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with this product at all and will not be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> Great product. My hair us very thick from using this.</li>
    <li> All I have is one word to say awesome. This oil grows your hair very fast.</li>
    <li> Well I can&#x27;t this increases hair growth, but I can say it does work for hair. It makes for a wonderful hair conditioner.  I&#x27;ve also found out that this goes well with other oils such as [[ASIN:B000BNRKPY Heritage Store Castor Oil, 32 Ounce]]. I don&#x27;t think this item makes miracles product, but it still does wonders for your hair.</li>
    <li> My natural black hair loves this oil, my hair absorbs this oil, plus why do u think the Jamaicans have beautiful thick hair</li>
    <li> I LOVE JBCO! This all natural product has made a world of difference to my 3c/4a hair! Will order this product again...and again!</li>
    <li> really excellent quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product almost 3 weeks now and so far I&#x27;ve only been experiencing shading! I think I&#x27;ll try to grease and see how that works for me.</li>
    <li> I use this on my hair a few times a week to moisturize and seal my hair.  I LOOOOOVE IT! It makes my 4C hair super soft and managable!  It&#x27;s super thick (which my hair needs), so it may be better to put it on at night, so your hair has time to absorb it.  It does have a nutty/woody smell...but it doesn&#x27;t linger.  Some people complained that it made their hair itchy...but I didn&#x27;t have that problem at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Jamaican Black Castor Oil for about a month now and I really like it. It is a little thick but I try to use it lightly. It makes my scalp feel great, stops the itching, and it is a great moisturizer for my brittle hair. It has definitely reduced the brittleness and breaking of my hair. I&#x27;ll update in a few months on additional progress.</li>
    <li> Fast ship! Good product so far</li>
    <li> It smells terrible and I Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Very good oil for hair growth. It grew my hair very fast and kept my scalp moisturized.  will order again</li>
    <li> JBCO is a moisturizing oil with anti-bacterial properties. I use this for everything! Sore scalp, moisturizing my hair, pre-poo, oil-pulling. Jack of all trades product!</li>
    <li> So far so good. My hair is f&#x27;d up something serious. So a lot of products do not and will not work with me. I do like this product though because it does not leave my hair greasy and the oil is very thick. It helps with the itching under my weave.</li>
    <li> Delivery was very quick! Excellent product, it helps thicken my hair &amp; helps my hair grow! Great price! I use it as a scalp treatment. Nice large size bottle. I will absolutely buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!!! Does wonders for my hair and growth.</li>
    <li> Daughter seems to be very satisfied with this product.  It works well for her hair.</li>
    <li> This has really made my daughter edges grow... I am now going to start using this on my own hair</li>
    <li> Excellent for growth on my fine thin natural 4A hair. I don&#x27;t grow hair very fast but this allowed me to get 1/2 inch of growth a month when I&#x27;m doing a grow out challenge. I add this to all the products I use, Shampoo, Conditoner, Deep Conditioner, Leave In and I use it straight out of the bottle. I protective style and use this. Great for using it with the LOC Method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom has/had breast cancer and I read that this helps. So I had my mom rub this on her breast everyday for 5 years and she has been cancer free for 5 years. The did chemo and took her meds and rubbed this on her chest. I thank God for this. I don&#x27;t know if this really works on breast cancer but I&#x27;m glad we tried and she is cancer free.</li>
    <li> My hair was falling out badly. This product saved my hair. I would have lost all my hair if it wasn&#x27;t for this product. The smell is a little odd but my hair was more important.</li>
    <li> Very good product came on time..I give 5 stars</li>
    <li> Works great on hair when you use consistently</li>
    <li> Great for castor oil packs for Liver detox.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the use in my natural 4B/C and my daughter&#x27;s 4A hair. It has brought much needed sheen and manageability to my hair. I have not used it long enough to know if it helps with growth as others have stated. My daughter and I both have very thick hair with no thin edges or ither issues. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love this product. I achieved thickness and softness so far ..a nice amount of growth too. I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Fixed a few of my hair problems and I will continue to use</li>
    <li> Love it! So many uses. It works!</li>
    <li> Awesome. Help with my dandruff as well. Superb product!!</li>
    <li> I used the product as directed. It left my hair feeling sticky and weighted down. I&#x27;m not sure of any results because I&#x27;ve only used once. I&#x27;ll continue to use and keep you posted. #Fingerscrossed</li>
    <li> Its thick but it works</li>
    <li> Use this on my skin and hair; does wonders for strength and moisturizing. A little goes a long way. Nice product to try.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Nothing happened</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Black Jamaican Castor Oil since becoming natural two years ago.  I love the results that it has on my type 4C hair.  It&#x27;s great for growing in those thin areas due to hair loss.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It stinks and really thick</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry hair and skin. I was looking for a healthy product to nourish my hair and give it life. This product is amazing and has solved my hair and skin issues.</li>
    <li> This is not I expected.  It is a heavy, thick, sticky oil.  I didn&#x27;t like the feel of the oil at all.  I used it on my hair and it just made my hair heavy.  The smell is okay...not the most precious scent.  I had high expectations but not sure what the type is about.  Sorry wish I could say something different. I prefer a lighter, sheer oil.</li>
    <li> I have been using this  product for ore than 6 months and i have seen improvements in my hair.It thickens it and also strengthens my hair. I use this oil because of its natural ingredients and also because it has no mineral oil or petrolatum in it which is harmful to your hair and could prevent growth. So this product is great for oiling your scalp and also as a hot oil treatment.</li>
    <li> Good skin and hair product. I rate this five stars. I either use it by itself or mix with my other essential oils.</li>
    <li> I was recommended to buy this product by someone I consider a &amp;#34;Natural Hair Guru&amp;#34; and she was definitely right! This oil is great for when my hair is dry, and it smells nice. There is not much else I can say; I did not buy the oil for what I was told it was good for—scalp rejuvenation—so, there is no noticeable change in that department since I didn&#x27;t have an issue with that to begin with. However, I have since recommended this to another friend and she loves it! I love natural products for natural hair! Thanks again Isle Living for changing the address on my delivery and refunding the fees incurred when the international shipping didn&#x27;t follow through!</li>
    <li> First of all, I ordered this product because I&#x27;ve seen a lot of positive reviews on YouTube and here on Amazon. No one ever really went indepth about the smell of it. The smell isn&#x27;t horrible, especially if you mix it with another oil that smells good. I chose to mix mine with coconut oil (this is my absolute favorite smell). Although I mixed it with the coconut oil, I could still smell the castor oil. I&#x27;m not sure what other castor oils smell like but in my opinion, it smells like a cooking oil maybe. I can&#x27;t really describe it. What ever the case, it&#x27;s not a pleasant smell. I didn&#x27;t realize until after I had order this product that it comes in lavendar scent as well. Not sure what the lavendar one smells like, but surly it has to smell better than the regular one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So,I rated the JBCO a 3 star because I have discontinued the use of it and didn&#x27;t get to see if it would actually benifit me at all. I&#x27;ve only had it for about a month and used it for about 2 weeks after getting it. I dislike the smell of it. I was gonna try and muster through the smell for the benifit of it, but I couldn&#x27;t do it. I just feel that there are other products out there that can possibly bring the same results, but smell better. So, I&#x27;m gonna try some other things and see what my results are. If all else fails, I&#x27;ll come back to this product but maybe try the lavendar one instead.</li>
    <li> Good for healthy hair growth. I definitely can&#x27;t be without this EVER!!! Other than the strong burnt smell it has, I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This is great. A bit sticky but really helps retain moisture in your hair. I used to have a lot of hair loss. It is now contained. I believe this oil has really helped. Just giving it 4 stars as I don&#x27;t like its smell and is sticky.</li>
    <li> This oil is AAmazing, I read several reviews from other sites as well as Amazon and decided to give it A try for hair growth including thinning edges, it really works, just massaging into the areas I wanted to grow and I begin to see A noticeable difference in my edges as well  as  growth in the rest of my hair in about 3 weeks. It also has anti-inflammatory properties,and  it lightens dark spots. I scraped the top of my foot and there was a dark mark where the scar was it&amp;#34;s lightened up since I&amp;#34;ve been applying it once A day Ive read that some people say it smells bad, but to me it&amp;#34;s not A bad odor it&amp;#34;s different. Iam  very pleased with this oil and this seller, this is my second bottle and both times the shipment was prompt and in tact. I will  order from them again.</li>
    <li> In my previous review I loved this stuff but after a while it made my scalp so itchy. It&#x27;s very thick and it&#x27;s great to seal your ends I don&#x27;t like it for my scalp anymore. It Did wonders in the beginning. Just think it too thick for the scalp!</li>
    <li> It makes my hair soooo soft. (I have natural 4C hair) my hair gets dry soo fast and it softens it nicely. i think its helping with growth...iv used for 1month alone... but u love it and would definitely buy more of it</li>
    <li> This is my second order.  My hair was about an 1/2 inch long in January 2013.  Now it is more than 6 1/2 inches long.  This product is really good for my hair.  I stopped using relaxers and cutting it so much.  It is so healthy.  Sometimes when I blow it out and flat iron, it looks like a wig.  Thanks to my daughter, I now have the hair I had lost many years ago.  It is great for keeping your natural hair healthy and strong.  Will keep buying!</li>
    <li> I really like this oil.  I tried it after watching videos on you tube about it&#x27;s results.  I have been using it for about 2 months now on me and my daughters hair and I have noticed growth where I lost hair and my  daughters hair has grown about an inch so far.  The smell of it is good because it is very light and natural and I read feedback that it makes your hair itchy but so far our hair is not itchy.  :)  I use it about 2 times a week on our hair to grease our scalps and I can tell our hair loves it.  I will continue to use this oil.</li>
    <li> I really dont see the difference in this and regular castor oil. I have both.  This one has a ashy/nutty smell and is dark in color.  It does not penetrate any better than the clear castor/odorless version I have from whole foods but it costs most. Both products are heavy and neither penetrates my scalp.  I have notice some thickening but not a drastic amount and no increase in growth. I use this about twice a week as a prepoo with wheat germ oil and then as a spot treatment during the week.  I may repurchase once I use up the clear castor oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 12, 2012&lt;br /&gt;I repurchased this product becuase I realized I was adding other others to thin the regular clear castor oil.  This product I dont have to mix with any other oil, and I am convinced that it works better to thicken and shine my hair much better than the clear oil I was using.  Its pricey, but when I add in the cost of the second oil to thin the regular castor...it&#x27;s about the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still feel as if the castor oil helps to thicken but I dont think I&#x27;ve gotten any additional growth.</li>
    <li> This product is something I will tell others about especially since I am pleased with the results I have experienced.</li>
    <li> It works great just made my head itch a lot but different strokes for different folks it may be different with others</li>
    <li> I purchased Jamaican Black Castor Oil primarily for hair growth around my hair line. I have noticed increased growth and thicken of my hair. Additionally, using the oil all over my hair has helped with dryness.</li>
    <li> I love it!! I can see improvements in my daughter&#x27;s hair line already! This jar can last a long time because it&#x27;s so thick.</li>
    <li> I love Jamaican Black Castor oil.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a month and half.  Everyone talks about the smell, but really it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.  I am a black woman with coarse natural hair.  After the 1st use of the product as a deep conditioner, my hair felt softer and silker.  I use it daily on my scalp for hair thickening.  I think it&#x27;s too early to see results as I already have thick hair, BUT I am slowing cutting my hair because of heat damage.  I&#x27;m not sure about a hair growth difference as of yet, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s working.  I will ALWAYS use this product... It feels so wonderful!!!</li>
    <li> I mix this oil with sweet almond oil and apply it to my scalp everyday. Ever since I have been using it my hair has been getting so thick and my scalp remain moisturized. I also mix it with MN (yeast infection cream) and I have been getting great result. I love it, and suggest who ever is curious bout it to try it and redeem great results for yourself!</li>
    <li> Really does work! I saw improvement in my edges within a month of using it. It&#x27;s really thick and has a heavy smell so I used it every other day. It&#x27;s also really good to use with a conditioner or deep conditioner if you have dry flakey scalp, just remember to rinse it out. But this def is a good buy.</li>
    <li> I love jbco. I decided to buy after reading all the rave reviews, reading the natural blogs, and videos. My edges and crown of my scalp are hopelessly thin. Also I constantly have breakage. I am AA with 4a/b hair, I also have Lupus and take various medications that have basically sent my hair straight to hell. This product gives me hope that my hair can once again be healthy. I am not expecting a miracle, but I at least know that I have less shedding with it. I also apply it to my eyebrows and eyelashes at night. I had a bald spot on one of my eyebrows and it is already starting to fill in after three weeks. I can also my eyelashes beginning to grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair regimen consists of massaging my hair with this every night. Sometimes I skip a night or two because of lack of time. I also bought an applicator bottle with a nostle for easier application which helps a lot in really getting down to the scalp. I don&#x27;t mind the thickness of it; actually I feel like the thickness actually helps my hair not break off. I have had this product for three weeks and although the results are subtle, I am really happy. In the past I have also used Rogain and I would much rather use this than a product filled with chemicals seeping into my blood stream. I am very happy with this product and I think you will be happy with it as well.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair and have used other products to provide the protection oil provides. My scalp still itches, but its controlled. The product does have a smokey aroma, but its not unbearable.</li>
    <li> After washing with this product my hair became flat  and looked terrible.&lt;br /&gt;And also it caused shedding and I immediately discontinued after just one use, and I don&#x27;t understand how this product helps grow hair???&lt;br /&gt;Overall just a really bad experiences.</li>
    <li> I just love this oil. I will definitely be getting more!</li>
    <li> Definitely grows your hair, great for your skin and hair.  Very thick oil, use little by little.</li>
    <li> Very thick, can be messy, but had grown my hair thicker....</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS FOR MY HAIR NEED MORE</li>
    <li> I would&#x27;ve given this oil 5 stars but due to the horrible smell I just couldnt do so. I love how it works on my hair when I prepoo but the smell is terrible. However, once I wash and condition my hair the smell is 100% gone.</li>
    <li> I love Jamaican Black Castor Oil. It si great to mix with shea butter for the skin and it works wonders for hair growth!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing.  Hands down!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I purchased this to help grow my hair because I&#x27;m trying to transition from relaxed to natural and I heard that JBCO will do your hair wonders! And let me say, it&#x27;s true. I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a month and I have more than an inch of new growth!! I put this in my hair 3 times a week at night and wrap my hair up and so far it&#x27;s amazing. I also wanted to grow back my eyebrows and make them thicker and it&#x27;s working. They&#x27;re are some cons though. Like the smell. Also I&#x27;ve experienced some hair shedding but nothing abnormal. I will continue to use this and repurchased.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my mom she was informed of it by a lady she knows .  My mom really likes this product its also good for your skin and she uses it on her hair due to some bumps that came into her head about a year ago now.  Her hair had started thinning and we are not sure why this pimples have appeared but praying that it continues to help heal her head and her long luxurious locks return.</li>
    <li> Work very well use it for hair growth and it worked.</li>
    <li> Because I have a hairstyle right now, I can&#x27;t see the growth or non-growth. I&#x27;ll check back in a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> I have kinky, coily hair and I use this for moisturizing but just a little, it can make my hair hard if I use to much. I really like it. I mix it with other hair products too.</li>
    <li> I love castor oil.  Its a great sealant.  It smells woodsy but that goes away to me.  Ive let my boyfriend use it on thinning spots and I SEE GROWTH.  He is going to buy his own bottle.  (i didnt want him to use all mine.  lol)  I havent seen much in my growth but my hair is a lot longer so its probably easier to see on shorter hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw, im a kinky curly.</li>
    <li> I used this product for the first time last night and I am happy. I have very course natural hair (5 stages beyond what you call 4c!!!); my major challenges is finding oils that my hair can actually absorb. i washed my hair and used this oil when my hair was dry...i was amazed; NO OIL is ever able to get absorbed by my hair, especially when it is dry. I bought this oil mainly for my weak edges, but it seems it will help with all my hair issues.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! I highly recommend that other try this product. Shipping was fast and easy. Made hair feel great, it also helps with retaining moisture.</li>
    <li> I really wish I could buy this in bulk! I use it in several of my hair care product recipes and it&#x27;s just fantastic!!</li>
    <li> This oil is very excellent and unique I have long hair in two weeks,&#x27;&#x27; I was impressed by all my friends have noticed the change and Introduction hair growth and demise of the cortex actually this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> So far so good! I love its thick and rich texture. It feels really good on my scalp as well, so yes, it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It is not smelly.  I has a non-scented smell.  It is light and goes right into my skin.  Love this.</li>
    <li> This oil calms down rough ends and give you a light shine. Very this and the smell is earthy. I don&#x27;t mind but I know some people might. I continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an all natural oil to help me with my thinning edges and this product came up. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short amount of time but I love how thick the oil is. It is very moisturizing and does not leave your hands feeling oily. It took some time for my package to come but the company was quick at responding to me and helping me track my package. I look forward to seeing the results from using this oil and I will definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Exactly what i wanted. It was packaged right and came within a satisfactory amount of time. I plan to continue ordering</li>
    <li> Exactly the quality I was searching for. Great moisturizer for African American natural hair types. The brand is very good.</li>
    <li> I use this product for hair growth. It has met all my expectations. Will definitely purchase again in the near future</li>
    <li> Love JBCO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hated it at first because of the smell and the consistency, but honestly, the pros outweigh the cons. (The smell doesn&#x27;t last once its in your hair.. and I usually use it with other oils to thin it out)&lt;br /&gt;I kept using it because of the good reviews and I&#x27;m so glad I did. My hair is fuller and thicker because of this.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Defintely grows in hair and keeps it soft. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot just time massaging it in to desired spots.</li>
    <li> This produce was received as described, Product received as described, great product, timely shipment.  Product works as described...great product!!!! Works as described.</li>
    <li> I have sisterlocs and this oil controls my frizzy hair its thick but once you rub it in your hands it melts like butter my hair love this oil cant wait to see the growth.</li>
    <li> i used thie produce on my legs,arms.it last all day untill you shower or take a Bath.not good for groth</li>
    <li> The best stuff for natural black women hair. The best product for growing the hair out.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  I mix it with Emu Oil, Jojoba Oil, Vit E Oil, Avocado Oil to moisturize my hair and skin...feels luxurious!</li>
    <li> It is helping my hair grow, I&#x27;ve seen results since I stared using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Brought a few bottles. I like the smell. I added some rosemary oil with it. Manage dandruff well. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> real oily so cause a lot of built up acne.  takes a little time to work but be consistent with it and patient</li>
    <li> Very thick castor oil, worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Took me half year to find out that it does make my lashes grow And my eye brows get neat cos i didnt go out and put mascara on a lot. Beauty takes time.</li>
    <li> It has help give my hair some shine and have helped my waves. But it has not done what I bought it to do. And that&#x27;s help grow my hair and fill in thin spots</li>
    <li> It was an easy process, high marks all around, highly recommend and will buy again... keep up the great work!</li>
    <li> This purchase was for a friend.  She loves this product for her hair.  I can&#x27;t give a full review because I did not purchase it for myself, but she loves it.</li>
    <li> Great product easy to apply in hair its not too messy. Highly recommend this product if your trying to thickening your hair. I been using it for a month now and i love it!!</li>
    <li> I gave 5 stars because JBCO is Awesome! Seals in the moisture I need to retain for the harsh winter months. It is heavy so I dilute with coconut oil or jojoba. I use 1-2x a week, massaging into my scalp and sealing in moisture.</li>
    <li> Many years ago during my ten year stay in Africa, a close friend of mine from Iran, cut her hair and after absolutely massacring it, she decided she didn&#x27;t like short hair at all. After I cracked a joke, &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t worry it&#x27;ll grow on you,&amp;#34; which she accepted with a crooked smile, she decided to do something about it.  Within a few weeks I noticed that her hair was growing by leaps and bounds.  I asked her about it, and she said &amp;#34;Oh it&#x27;s that Black Castor Oil I&#x27;m using.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now many years later I find I don&#x27;t like wearing my hair short either, only mine was not growing on me.  Remembering my&lt;br /&gt;wisecrack and her remedy,I tried it, and now my hair is &amp;#34;growing on me.&amp;#34;  Thanks goodness&lt;br /&gt;Bonita Evans, Ph.D.</li>
    <li> I looked at a number of people on youtube talking about the Jamaican Black Castor. I purchased the Jamican Black Castor Oil because of my hair thining around the edges and breaking. In less a couple of weeks my hair stopped breaking has grown back.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on a Thursday and it arrived on a Saturday in a secure package. At this time I am using Rogaine to regrow my hair line as well as my eyebrows. The Rogaine costs $39.00 for a package of three 4 oz bottles. After using it for a year there is a big difference in my eyebrows but not that much with my hair line. I decided to order JBCO after reading the reviews. I am so excited about trying this natural product and will keep you posted on the results. My hair is natural and thinning which may be because of age (57). Hopefully this will work. I am giving this 5 stars because of the speed of delivery and the protective package.</li>
    <li> I love this oil, because it makes your hair grow and its moisturizes my hair, this oil loves my hair and my hair is growing like crazy.</li>
    <li> My thinning spots are filling in with gray hair. Nothing that a little hair can&#x27;t help. LOL. Also noticed that my eyebrows are getting bushy. Jamaican Castor Oil works... Maybe a little too well.</li>
    <li> nice size for the price</li>
    <li> Not sure if this really works for my hair lose or shine for my hair but will try more.</li>
    <li> its a great thick oil, i use it on my scalp</li>
    <li> This works great in my hair and actually made it grow it&#x27;s awesome</li>
    <li> I have seen a difference in my hair since using this product. I see a lot of hair growth around my edges. I apply it at night time. I also use this when I got box braids and it help a lot. Will order again.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t smell like I expected.  The smell was very slight. My skin loved it from day one.</li>
    <li> Simply stated amazing from your head to toe.</li>
    <li> A deep hairline runs in the women in my famiy. We also have thin almost staight hair that makes it very easy to become damaged due to stress, poor styling habits ect... my hairline was really thinning out. The derm put me on mens rogaine beciz it is stronger than the womens, but an elderly black sister at the West i dian grocery store told me about this product. She also suggested monostat creme twice a week- yup the stuff for yeast infections. It jas been two months and a great deal of growtj has occured. I had beem using rje rogaine for more tjan two years and had not seen this much growth. It does not smell great bur the smell goes away very quickley. It is very thick though so mostly use an eye dropper. Also i have been using it on my granssons ezcema and it is totally gone where before even with the hydrocortisone he would still dig at it&lt;br /&gt; It is wonderful&lt;br /&gt; I use it in the am before i wash my face incase it drips, which it has not. And in the pm to smootj my braids and keep them from becoming frizzy while it is &amp;#34;resting&amp;#34; in a protective hair style. Try it.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this product. I used it for my hair, my scalp specifically and I mix it with a few other oils.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected, seeing results in a short time.  Will order again when this order is completed. Try it.</li>
    <li> When I ws in my 20s, I abused my hair so bad. I wear my hair just relaxed now..and this JBCO is my bff! It really softens my scalp and I love the fact that it&#x27;s not runny. Even put a little on my browss and now they have thickened up as well. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> About time that I&#x27;ve found something that actually softens my beard bingo, I like this oil a lot. But be warned it&#x27;s very thick an can be greasy don&#x27;t over do it, so I put it on at night before bed comb an brush it in. With this method I&#x27;m good to go. Also makes my beard look thicker which I like. Will be buying more. An the company packed the glass bottle with care A+ company.</li>
    <li> Have not seen much of a change or growth of edges as other reviewers however will keep massaging into scalp and allow more time to update review.</li>
    <li> Packaged well. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> this is good oil i grease my hair with it , my hair was thinning out around the edges and it brought it back you don&#x27;t have to use a lot its really good will buy more before i run out</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery and safe packaging. I have heard so many great things about this product really excited to see how it works for me.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It has been amazing for growing back my hair line . It works great for my natural hair I just can&#x27;t believe the growth I&#x27;ve gotten from using this oil.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for it.</li>
    <li> I like this brand of castor oil its great</li>
    <li> I just love this oil, it helped with my dandruff, dry and itchy scalp and I loce it as a sealant to keep moisture in my hair</li>
    <li> Works well still using forceedukta</li>
    <li> I recently did the big chop and I have been using this among other oils to grow my hair back and I must say it is working I mixed black castor oil with extra virgin olive oil,grape seed oil,and coconut oil in a applicator bottle and I heat it up apply it to my scalp once a day and my hair is growing so I had to order another bottle for the price I paid its worth it ...even though the post office lost my package again I finally received it today.</li>
    <li> Seems to do a better job at moisturizing my hair than coconut oil...it has also helped grown back my edges.</li>
    <li> It works, my&lt;br /&gt;hair is long and thick</li>
    <li> I like this product. It has a very strong odor, but it seemed to do the trick!</li>
    <li> Excellent for hair this product made my hair thicker in 2 months.</li>
    <li> This item shipped quickly, I was about to run out.  If you&#x27;ve never used it, this is a darker version to what most of us know castor oil to look like.  It is not actually &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; as the name implies its more of an olive green/brown mix.  The bottle is actually darker than the actual product.  Its slightly thicker than the drug store kind but has no real smell.  Its far better than the stuff I had to hold my nose around as a kid.  Makes a wonderful addition to my winter oil mix (I feel its too thick to use alone).  Adds wonderful moisture to skin and some hair types.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone with straight hair or if your prone to oily build up. Pros: much larger than drug store brands, much thicker than some of the ones found in larger bottles, leaves hair and skin moisturized. Mixed with other oils will thin it out. Cons: Some may not like the slightly thick consistency</li>
    <li> Package came as expected. Haven&#x27;t used long enough to notice difference yet.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have a thin hair line and some thinning of my hair at the top of my head. After about three weeks I noticed that my hair is growing in those areas. My friend suggested that I try it and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after reading all the reviews about making the hair grow and stopping the hair loss,  It did not work for me. I am not bald or anything, but have plenty of hair fall. I applied it for over 4 weeks 4 times a week, after every shower my scalp became too dry and did not see hair growth in any new places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say this is just like any other oil which will moisturize your hair. Nothing more , nothing less !</li>
    <li> I purchased this product 4 days ago. The reviews on here were somewhat positive and I am normally skeptical about using hair growth treatments. I wear a lot of ponytails and wear my hair pulled back tightly. Overtime my sides have thinned out and you can see my scalp. I have been using fillers to hide the baldness and have spent so much on hair growth products by pharmaceutical companies and basically gave up until I read the reviews on amazon. I have mixed long curly hair and currently started using this product for 4 days....and by all means this product is awesome. My hair was also curly, tangled and dry most of the time bcz I wear my hair natural and use a leave in conditioner to maintain the curl. I never thought I would say this but I wash my hair twice a day and use this product after I towel dry to seal in the moisture. My hair grows fast but my sides were thin and bald I love this product and will continue to use it for moisture. It may not work for everyone but it sure has been working for my hair. This is thick oil and smells funny. Mix this with green tea tree oil to stimulate your scalp where your thinning every night and you will feel and see a difference. My hair looks like it did as a teenager thick, long and healthy. Thank you for selling this product amazon its a beautiful thing.</li>
    <li> I like it so far, smell a little bit annoying, but not terrible:)</li>
    <li> No complaints. Not sure how the product works as of yet.  I will perhaps comment later.  It&#x27;s thick and dark.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way with this Jamaican Black Castor oil! Love how thick it is!! I have used this to make gifts. I have been recommending this product to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I have heard so many wonderful things about this product; however, I feel like it leaves my hair super dried and scalp itchy :( Maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong ? I even tried mixing it with my conditioner but it didn&#x27;t make a big difference. HELP!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using JBCO for years and I absolutely love it. I have 4C hair that tends to be drier and I need a thicker oil/butter to serve as a better sealant (as opposed to oils like olive oil and jojoba oil). This oil definitely does the trick. I&#x27;ve been natural for several years but used to get my hair pressed faithfully every few weeks. I stopped doing that and pledged to learn to take care of my kinky curls myself, and everyone has commented on how thick it&#x27;s gotten. While I can&#x27;t attribute it all to JBCO, I would definitely say it helps. The draw back would be the smell (it smells like smoke), but it doesn&#x27;t linger so I&#x27;m okay with it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Jamaican Black castor oil for over a year now (maybe even longer than a year) and I can honestly say that this product does grow my hair (I&#x27;m very impressed with the oil). I use it even more now than I use to and I see major improvements. I am African American with hair that grows by it&#x27;s self alone but I am always trimming my hair to keep it at shoulder length and I use oils only on my hair no conditioner (e.g. B&amp;B castor oil or grease as we call it), using this three to four times a week grows my hair very fast. I love that it also keeps my hair shiny and very healthy. I also use Tropic Isle Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth oil (excellent for the scalp and grows hair just as good as the Castor oil) mixed in with the Jamaican Black Castor Oil to thin out the  Jamaican Black Castor Oil...</li>
    <li> Very happy with results...didn&#x27;t think it would work but the outcome was wonderful. I will be reordering again soon. Great product!!!</li>
    <li> I was experiencing a lot of breakage from brittle dry hair due to using hair dye I&#x27;m Natural no perm it&#x27;s been less than a week I already notice a difference hair seems to have a thickness when combing it also no hair breaking off when I comb through my hair!! This is phenomenal on African American hair. Purchased it fr local beauty store but will be purchasing fr amazon fr now on my miracle in a little bottle!!!! God Bless&#x27;</li>
    <li> I ordered three bottles, one for me, my sister, and mother-in-love.  My sister has had thinning in her hair for many years, and some balding.  After 3 weeks use, she now has hair growing in her hair line, and it seems to be thickening up.  I rarely go to the salon, but I recently went for a trim, and the first thing the stylist said was &amp;#34;Your hair is so soft!&amp;#34;  Not sure if it&#x27;s benefiting my mother-in-love yet, but I&#x27;ll follow up soon. I have been recommending this to anyone who has natural hair.  Oh, and the smell is not that bad.  Once you get it on your hair, you don&#x27;t even smell it.</li>
    <li> I buy it for hair regrowt but did&#x27;n do anything</li>
    <li> I love this product. I had used it before and couldn&#x27;t remember where I purchased it. It&#x27;s heavy and it lasts a long time.  You only need to use a small amount because of the weight. I use it right after shampooing and it moisturizes my entire head.</li>
    <li> Extra Dark is alot more beneficial to what I was looking for I use this particular one for a shampoo for my hair.</li>
    <li> I have 4b/4c natural hair and I use this oil to deep condition and seal. I also use this oil for my diy lash lengthening and thickening serum. It works great for my hair by holding in the moisture for a full 7 days when using the LOC Method for twistouts and rod sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can also be used skin. I haven&#x27;t tried that yet</li>
    <li> I use this product each night before I when to bed. I notice that my hair around the edges was starting to grow in where it was bald from my hair being braided to tightly. I&#x27;ve tried many different products but this one actual works. I am very grateful, I though my hair was never going to grow back. I found out about this wonderful product from a nice women in a Wal mart Store. We were both shopping and I happen to notice her beautiful natural hair and we started talking about different products to use hard to grow hair and that when Jamaican Black Castor Oil came up. She told where I could go to order the product.  I Love  wearing  my hair up, now I can.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Bunch !&lt;br /&gt;GVD</li>
    <li> The item is very good. I love it. The packaging was bad. The top for the oil broke  and the oil spilled into the package. Bad packaging but good castor oil.</li>
    <li> results I&#x27;m trying to get.  However, the itching has stopped.  I will continue use of the product until the bottle is empty.</li>
    <li> I think it worked, because my cousin who does my hair says that there has been definite growth. I also took Biotin 10,000 mcg.</li>
    <li> A Thick humectant. Not a very pleasing smell but not unpleasing either. I enjoy mixing this with other oils for the hair growth potential so far so good:))</li>
    <li> I don&#x27; quite understand what is happening with this oil and my hair. I have been using Jamaican Black castor oil for many years now. I have also used a few other oils very scarcely because I don&#x27;t want to have too many products in my hair at once. My hair has grown; I can&#x27;t exactly pin it to castor oil but I can see that my hair has grown significantly. What I do notice a lot now if the amount of shedding: long strands of hair just come out whenever I put a comb through my hair. I did not have that issue before. The oil from this company does not seem as thick as the castor oil I used to get before, It also seems a lot clearer, as if it is mixed with something. I&#x27;m going to stop buying from this company and try another one or go back to the one I used to use so I can really notice the difference. I have struggled too much with my hair for me to just let it all fall off an have to start again.</li>
    <li> I got really sick and a lot of the different medicines I had to take took my hair out around the edges. I mixed with some other hair growth ointment and applied nightly for 3 months to the edges of my hair. My edges finally came back. I would have to say this producted helped more the other, because I had been using the hair ointment on my edges by itself for 1 month before I added this and the results were most positive after adding Jamaican Black Caster Oil</li>
    <li> Its great i love it my hair is growing back and getting thicker i will be investing in more some one recommended to me and im glad they Did</li>
    <li> Love this Oyl!! My hair grew really fast with this stuff! Make sure you use a little at a time, because it&#x27;s really thick. I bought two...GREAT PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> I have been useing the jamacian castor oil for one month now . i have not seen hair growth yet but i  do have alot of moisture in my hair . i love  how soft my hair  has gotten . i hope that i will see some results on the hair growth soon . i will keep you guys posted.</li>
    <li> My daughter is wearing her hair natural, and she swears it has given her more control and less frizz. I will be using in my own product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff because it really works, I wear weaves real talk, and i have my leave out always out daily heat damage. But since ive bought this my edges have grown a bit but you must be consistant with the application every night. Its thick and has no smell and is worth it...</li>
    <li> What a hair treatment  at such a good  price  Other products with their fancy packaging does not compare to the wonder treatment  for the hair  Glad  I found this product  Try it  You will not be disappointed</li>
    <li> I have tried to like this product.  Two bottles later and I have not seen any differences.  I would think twice before purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed this product. My edges are better. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This castor oil is an amazing oil . It has so many benifits for the hair and skin. However,  I used this oil on my scalp. And it made my hair thicker. I also used the oil in my conditioners for maximum results.  Because my hair is thin. I  definitely recommend this oil . One will see benefits in some way or another depending upon his or use of the oil. This oil is  a must have. I will definetely be making another purchase soon.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Works great for my hair. Keeps it hydrated while adding thickness to it. I originally bought it to help grow my edges and after three months I noticed a significant chance but you have to keep using the product to keep seeing results. Overall I now keep this item in my hair care regimen.</li>
    <li> Awesome for my skin and hair.</li>
    <li> I received the product very timely, almost too quickly...:O)  When I first read about the benefits of JBCO, out of impatience, I drove the same day to a local beauty supply and bought a small bottle (a no-name brand ...lol. Had I known the Amazon shipment would be so quick, I might have waited)...But I digress..  So, I&#x27;m nearly out of the no-name brand and will begin this product shortly.  (Hence the 4 stars versus 5).    MY RESULTS: My edges were never really bad, but due to years of wig-wearing my hairline had become somewhat thin. That was my original reason for using the JBCO. And I have noticed a difference already. At 2 places near my left and right temples, the hair which was noticeably thinner is now filling in.  Yay!  I told a friend about it.  She used it on her daughter&#x27;s edges and they have now filled in as well!    PLEASE KNOW: For those of you ladies who continue to lose hair despite using JBCO, you might also look into OTHER POTENTIAL REASONS.  A few years ago, my hair just started coming out.  Not breaking out, COMING OUT, as I have always had lots of long, thick hair (I mostly wear wigs for variety of style and color). Thank the Lord, my hair also grows fast, otherwise with the amount I lost, I&#x27;d have been bald in not time...:O( Just touching my hair, I would have swatches of my hair in my hand.  Because I had just reached a &#x27;milestone birthday,&#x27;  I attributed it to the natural progression of age.  During a routine annual physical, however, I finally learned I was anemic.  I believe this contributed to my hair loss.  For as soon as I began iron supplements and reversed the anemia, my hair stopped coming out.    Also, hormonal imbalances (especially thyroid imbalance) will definitely cause you to lose hair. (BTW, if you don&#x27;t eat iodized salt or take kelp or seaweed supplements, your iodine intake may be too low. Low iodine negatively affects your thyroid).    So, before you give up, have your doctor or nutritionist check for these common issues we women have.  All the oil in the world won&#x27;t undo the effects of an imbalance in the body.  Believe me, I know.  Being someone who would&#x27;ve tried everything on the market to stop my hair from falling out, I can honestly say JBCO would not have worked on me until I corrected the blood anemia.    Hope this helps those who haven&#x27;t been able to find the answer otherwise.    Blessings!</li>
    <li> I gave it four stars because of the smell ugh!!! But other than that my hair stays moisturizer longer. I had to cut my hair really low because off a bad dye job. I&#x27;m african american and I needed something to help my damaged hair get back to the way it used to be. It&#x27;s been about a month or so since I cut it but my hair is definitely thicker and the more damaged parts have grown back healthier.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is thick and helps seal the mosisture in my hair. I usually put it on my scalp and massage it in. It has worked better than a lot of the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products that people have recommended for natural hair. In my opinion the scent is mild but it may take some getting used to.</li>
    <li> I hate product gave me sores in my head, didn&#x27;t work for me but heard alot of great things about it</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why everyone says that JBCO smells so terrible; I just received mine and IT HAS NO SMELL.  I only started using it on my scalp last night, so I cannot comment as to how well it works for hair growth and scalp health.  I just wanted to say that if someone is considering this product but hesitant to buy it because of the &amp;#34;terrible smell,&amp;#34; it doesn&#x27;t have one.  I swear.</li>
    <li> The smell is not great. It reminds me of the scent of cigarette ash. However, it clears my skin right on up and Its to soon to notice any difference it has had on my natural hair to comment on its effect on my hair. I will keep using it to see and if it continues to work for me as it has so far I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
    <li> This will now be a staple for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This potent oil works wonders, I put it on my eyebrows and eyelashes and in less than 2 weeks noticed thickness and growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for my hair to alleviate shrinkage and dryness especially.</li>
    <li> Wow...really helped my edges,  be patient, but it does work..</li>
    <li> This oil does wonders for my scalp and for thickening my hair. I LOVE it. The smell is a little smoky, but it can be masked by my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Super thick, worked on my dey scalp.  Has a smokey smell.</li>
    <li> My hair just loves Jbco .My hair is natural 4b/4c so it can get rough but, Jbco make my new growth so soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> This is a staple! I could just state that alone and it would be enough for me. This has helped get my hair back on track from me abusing it</li>
    <li> Very effective product,  fast shipping. for those who have&lt;br /&gt;natural hair, this is a good solution you can come across.</li>
    <li> JBCO is my hair&#x27;s best friend . It&#x27;s great for sealing in moisture and retaining length . Not only do i use it as part of my oil mix for my hair , but also in my oil mix for my body . So if you&#x27;re  looking for a great castor oil , this is it .</li>
    <li> Definitely helps grow back the hair that i may have lost in certain areas of my scalp (due to hair pulling or certain styles that caused stress). I&#x27;ve been buying this now for a year and it&#x27;s definitely a must have product for my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 4 months, and it grew my hair so much. I take 10,000 mcg of biotin daily and that&#x27;s a big factor in my hair growth too. I mix this oil with coconut oil and rosemary and put it in my hair. I wash it out and it&#x27;s so soft. My hair is wavy and long so when i&#x27;m out the shower  , I put a little bit of this on the ends and it&#x27;s really soft. I give it four stars because it smells horrible and it&#x27;s really thick and sticky.</li>
    <li> Best oil product that I have purchased to use on natural hair.  I read the reviews of others before purchasing, which made it easy for me to decide. My hair is healthy and thick from using this product.</li>
    <li> This works well at moisturizing hair but has the worst smell. It&#x27;s also really thick and kind of just lays on top of your hair. Good for styles that involves braids and such but not much else.</li>
    <li> Best product to grow beautiful hair regardless of texture.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. I moisturize my scalp with this and I started using it on my eye brows and eye lashes. I also love the burnt after smell it has. I recommend this to anyone who is trying to take good care of their hair and skin.</li>
    <li> This bottle lasted for a year which is crazy because it is not a lot of it in the bottle. It really makes your hair soft and really seals in the moister, and it definitely good for my braids. It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, clumps, and really keeps my scalp mainly good. I highy recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It&#x27;s not greasy and really helps with scalp issues.</li>
    <li> I am really convinced that this helps protect and thicken my edges.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love it! Use it daily on my skin and hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product for sealing me and my daughters&#x27; hair.  Very moisturizing.  The shipping was fast and I am pleased. I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> The product is great. I recently got a relaxer, I applied this to my hair a week after. I have a little puffiness in the center. So I can tell that the product is working. It keeps your hair moisturize without being to greasy. It really dosent have that bad of a s nmell to it. Im going to keep using it.</li>
    <li> Helpful with hair growth.</li>
    <li> Excited to get this product for my personal hair care</li>
    <li> I brought this product for my thinning edges, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s working. The edges look like they&#x27;ve filled in a little. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, every night.</li>
    <li> i use it every weekend ,,</li>
    <li> I am using the oil for my hair (middle) and front ends. I see remarkable improvement on the front after only a month&amp;#34;s use. Of importance to note is that the new hair growths are dark in color unlike my other grey colored hairs.</li>
    <li> Really thickened up my daughters hair and gave me protection for my delicate edges. Love it! I plan to buy more soon!</li>
    <li> I think I like it, but not sure.  I feel like I am seeing some hair growth in the area I am applying it in, but I want to give it more time.  I have been using it about two months.  I will come back and write another review in a month or two.  My son is using it now to get his hair to grow back where the barber has messed up his hair line from cutting it back too far.  I will get his take on it as well.</li>
    <li> Only been using for about a week now, but the smell isn&#x27;t as bad as I though. Not really pleasant, but also not like the smell of Wild Growth. It&#x27;s thicker than olive oil, slightly sticky, but not too much as I have thick natural hair. Right now my hair is straightened and a little goes a long way for my hair, but more is need to hydrate my scalp which I cannot use as much of or it will weigh down my hair. Hair has a nice shine and I can feel the moisture sealed in already. Even with moisture in the air, my hair has remained straight and bouncy and hasn&#x27;t poofed up as my naptural hair tends to do. I&#x27;m trying to get fuller edges in the temple area/crown/nape and hope this works. Will update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very speedy delivery.</li>
    <li> This brand works well for natural curly girls.  I keep ordering it through Amazon and love it, but is a little thicker than some other oils.</li>
    <li> My hair loves this stuff.  Purchasing this here instead of at my local beauty supply store was a lot cheaper.  My hair has been growing a lot since I began using this.  No weird side effects like I&#x27;ve heard some people complain about.  I use it on my daughter&#x27;s edges where her hair was broken off and it is back to it&#x27;s normal length.  My sides were thin but not anymore.  Than you Jamaican Black Castor Oil!</li>
    <li> I use this oil on my edges and also on the tips/ends of my hair of my natural 4-type hair.  I love the thickness of this oil. I have also used it as a massage oil for minor aches and pain and also for dry patches on my son&#x27;s legs.</li>
    <li> Great product but I found this product cheaper at the hair store. Same brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for only 3 weeks but my edges aren&#x27;t so thin anymore</li>
    <li> Love this product, the first time using it was when I saw my sister with it and I had to get a bottle of my own.  :))</li>
    <li> My hair loves it!  It has grown tremendously.</li>
    <li> Sticky, and stinky. This oil did not work wonders like how most people claim it does on this website. My hair is naturally thick with volume. After using this oil and washing it out, my hair became flat. It did not make my hair grow faster. It did not make my eye lashes grow faster. I guess this product works for a few people like they claim but for me, it did not.</li>
    <li> Exact like picture fast shipping too</li>
    <li> Great product! Very think and it doesn&#x27;t smell that great. It works wonders on my hair especially when I mix wit conditioner.</li>
    <li> It did indeed meet the expectations i had from reading the previosly posted reviews. It&#x27;s thick enough to not be runny and dripping everywhere. It stays put on your scalp and hair. It may be a little heavy for some hair types. But then, they would just need to use it sparingly. The smell is that of roasted peanuts, it&#x27;s not offensive at all to me. It keeps my fungal dandruff at bay. I no longer need to use antidandruff or antifungal shampoo. It does grow hair. It fills in bald spots and it even helps reinvigorate follicles that have been dormant for years. I put some on my mother&#x27;s bald spot and she said that she saw some growth. So, yes, i do recommend this and you will not be disappointed. And this is a very good value for the amount you get. You get less for the same price in the beauty supply stores. And i really like how care was taken to ship it to me. Very secure package and i&#x27;m loving it.</li>
    <li> This product really works wonders</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I use it on my scalp. Packaging and shipping was great.</li>
    <li> love love love... a must have, grows and strengthen my hair. tnx a lot, plus works well for skin problem. My husband says he don&#x27;t want to be without lol</li>
    <li> I had extremely damaged hair due to coloring and relaxing.  It was dry like hay and broken off.  I cut off all the broken hair and was left with approximately 1&amp;#34; of hair.  I started using the Jamaican Black Castor Oil mixed with Extra Virgin Coconut Oil as recommended by quite a few hair blogs.  I saw tremendous growth in 3 months.  It grew in thick and healthy.  That was over 5 years ago.  I must say that this is one of the few products where I can say that it does just as promised.  It enhances growth and thickness.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have read some say they do not like the smell, it&#x27;s mild to me.  I mixed a small amount in another bottle with a few drops of essential oil.  When I have used that up, I may try a different oil. We have been so used to perfume  added to our products we sometimes need to adjust to more natural smells.  Don&#x27;t let it stop you from using what you know deep inside will be good for you!</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. Hair is softer and more manageable. I don&#x27;t wash my hair daily and the moisture lasts for days. Wish there shipping deals on bigger sizes.</li>
    <li> When I first received the product I was not in love with the scent of the oil.  I wear my hair wrapped and I work out alot so I was desperate to use an oil to keep my hair moisturized. I use the oil now and I have noticed a difference in the moisture of my hair.  I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I use it around the perimeter of my hairline. It stimulates my scalp and adds thickness to my thinning edges.</li>
    <li> I personally love using castor oil in my hair but have been using the regular castor oil only. Decided to give this a try because of all the rave reviews about JBCO especially for regrowing edges. It works just a great as regular castor oil which is much cheaper than this so will gladly return to regular castor oil. didn&#x27;t notice anything special with JBCO. Didn&#x27;t notice much improvement with my edges using this oil though (just like the regular castor oil).</li>
    <li> Everything was what I expected! It came in a glass bottle. I hope it works well because I been needing a good oil.</li>
    <li> Best thing for the hair line and nape</li>
    <li> This oil was every thing I expected and more. It makes mine and my daughters hair it more manageable. It has some sort of detangling quality that I never have received.</li>
    <li> I had previously used another brand of castor oil for my hair.  This is far superior!  I will keep buying it in the future.</li>
    <li> This really works for my hair. I used castor oil as a kid and I forgot how great it worked. I think this product is great. I&#x27;m African- American and wear a sew in weave from time to time. I have dry hair and this products works wonders on keeping my hair moist and easy to comb.&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck for those that try JBC. I LOVE It.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for three reasons. One was to seal the ends of my two strand twist because my hair tends to come undone, maintaining moisture in my hair, and lastly to thicken up my eyebrows. Needless to say, it has exceeded my expectations. Love this product!!</li>
    <li> My Staple product.. I use this mainly for my scalp when I am messaging it in.. Does promote hair growth..</li>
    <li> Love this~! Wonderful smoky scent - it&#x27;s just fabulous stuff. I put it into my product for  hair growth, Rapid Brow and Rapid Hair here on Amazon. It definitely improved the formula!~ Thank you~!</li>
    <li> I love this castor oil. It&#x27;s very thick and rich. It has really helped in my hair growth and has thickened my hair a lot. I use it in my deep conditioner and on my ends of my hair. I like that it&#x27;s heavier than some of the other oils. I have really dry hair and this helped a lot. Very moisturizing. And you can use heat,.. Under a hooded dryer. Cover with a plastic cap/bag and just let the heat penetrate the oil. I just ordered another bottle today. Really helps with dryness, especially good for naturals who tend to have a little more dryness, like myself.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product it has really improve my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It really do make your hair grow. I even went back and ordered some&lt;br /&gt;for my best friend and she loves it to!!!</li>
    <li> Update 12/21/2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True and honest review -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil seems working, after applying directly in my scalp, after one month, especially the part where I have thinning hair, leaving it overnight 2x a week -I can now see tiny thin black growh all over my scalp!  I hope these tiny thin growth will be stronger and will not fall off when I go for coloring the gray roots.  Thank you, I will continue using this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review 11/15/2012&lt;br /&gt;The oil has a very slight smell but you won&#x27;t even notice it!  The oil is so thick, you do not need any special applicator to apply in your scalp.  I pour a little in the bottle lid then I dip my fingers and gently apply and massage my scalp.  There is a little itch but not disturbing.  I am trying this product because my hair is already thinning, I have a full hair a few years ago but as I get older plus I guess some medications, I am starting to have falling hair.  I have used a lot of products but nothing works, I will try this oil.  I will update this review if I will see an effect, both positive or negative, I gave it 5 stars for now.</li>
    <li> I use this to mix in with my other oils for my natural hair. For me I can&#x27;t use this directly on my scalp(reason I gave it 4 stars). It makes my scalp itch if I do. Thats just for me personally but it does what it says for hair..  Helped my hair grow longer and thicker!! Love it! :)</li>
    <li> I heard many good things about this product on youtube. I purchased the product for my mother because she is suffering from alopecia.  Since we started this product we can see hair starting to appear in the top of her head.  I highly recommend this product for people with thin edges or suffering from alopecia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otisa</li>
    <li> great hair oil that I have been using for awhile. It is alittle thick but you can always dilute it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product less than 1 month, but its a great moisturizer especially for extremely dry hair. I do think the JBO will do what is says over an extended period of time. I will continue to order this product and use it as my daily hair regimen</li>
    <li> I never take the time to write a review but I always read them before purchasing anything. However after using the BJCO I just had to write a review. About 7 years ago I got lashes for the first time for a wedding. I wasn’t sure if I was allergic to the glue or if it was the way I removed them but I pretty much lost all of my lashes. They were short, paper thin and in 7 years they never grew back. So about a month ago I decided to go natural and I was researching products that would help my thick course hair and I came across BJCO.  I received the product on 11/29 and used it immediately. I didn&#x27;t use it on my hair (which is what I initially purchased it for) but I used it on my lashes every night before bedtime. The product is very thick and smells like cigarette ashes but it is AMAZING. It has been 2 days shy of a month and I now have lashes again! I didn&#x27;t achieve this amount of growth in the 7 years after I took them off.  I then told my husband about this product and convinced him to let me use it on his thinning balding hair. OMG his hair is starting to grow in the spot where there hasn&#x27;t been any hair for years. He and I both are truly amazed at this product and we swear by it. If you can get past the smell I think you will be truly amazed at what this product does. I have and will continue to recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This oil is thick and nourishing. It has almost no smell. I think that it will do wonders for my dry hair and scalp.</li>
    <li> Everyone gives this great reviews but so far, my personal experience hasn&#x27;t been phenomenal.  I had locks for 18yrs. I&#x27;m currently in my late 30s. I don&#x27;t have a receding hair line but after cutting my locks, there were spots left with very little follicle. I blame the constant twisting, as I got my hair done weekly to bi-weekly.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 months and the proces is extremely slow. I see improvement but have not yet fixed the issue. I haven&#x27;t finished the bottle. I use a small dab once, daily after a shower. Patiently waiting to see how long it will take to heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 4 years later.&lt;br /&gt;I have not consistently used this product. Only purchased 2 bottles since I&#x27;ve cut my locks. Spot are still there and have seen a small improvement. I will attempt to use it twice a day for the next few months and report on any improvement.</li>
    <li> Very thick and smells horrible. I&#x27;ve been using it on my hair for three months and didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the softness or thickness of hair. I have fine hair so I expected at least more shine but it didn&#x27;t happen. I gave it three stars cuz I think my hair is not falling as it used to but still not sure!</li>
    <li> I love this brand of castor oil. I use it on my scalp and it&#x27;s the only thing I have found that helps with seborrhic dermatitis.</li>
    <li> The oil was used to restore a section of the hairline that was thinning.  I can see a little difference after using a bottle. Also, offers some relief when rubbed on legs for arthritic concerns.</li>
    <li> this oil did soften my hair and cleared up dandruff, but I fount it to be much too thick for my hair and it was hot on my scalp. I felt sweaty all the time.</li>
    <li> This oil is a great product. It has become a staple in my hair regimen. Really has helped with hair growth, especially around the edges.</li>
    <li> My hair is growing!! I added 12 drops of peppermint essential oil to get rid of the old cigarette smell</li>
    <li> I been using for about two weeks now and I like it better then the regular caster oil because it is not as thick and sticky. I am mainly using it for my hair and eye lashes, and I see a difference in my eye lashes already. 👍🏾</li>
    <li> Will never ever be without this stuff. Make my hair soft, shiny, and supple. Add it to any leave-in conditioner and watch it work.</li>
    <li> I have been applying this to my scalp 1-2x/week for &amp;#62;1 year.  Doesn&#x27;t instantly &amp;#34;regrow hair&amp;#34; (and I know because I have some central balding); but it does help and I think with some biotin forte (taken orally daily), would probably help a lot more. Keeps scalp moisturized, and I have actually noticed reduction in hair shedding/hair loss since using this; bald spot looks a lot fuller, but not &amp;#34;back to normal&amp;#34;; however, balding has not progressed since I started using this.  I haven&#x27;t been taking oral biotin, but intend to start again in 1-2 years.  Just remember to apply very little, or you might experience some scalp irritation/itching.  Overall, would purchase again (gone through 2-3 bottles so far).</li>
    <li> Just received my oil today and I&#x27;m excited! The smell ian&#x27;t a problem at all. Also it makes my hair feel moisturized and soft while wearing protective styles.</li>
    <li> I use it on my hair and scalp.  I typically put this along with some other oils in a mixture with Shea butter as a hair and body moisturizer. I&#x27;ll also put some castor oil in a spray bottle with water to spritz my hair with. I have very thick and coarse hair so this heavy oil works well for me.</li>
    <li> Over all it is kind of smelly and thick.  If you can deal with the smell then it is ok.  Good size bottle for the price.  Plus I used it for a hot oil treatment and it was alright</li>
    <li> My hair grew and grew and grew . I swear by this product ill always have it in my regimen. My hair is thicker softer and fuller after using it.</li>
    <li> Bought it before now buying it again yeaaasa mere :-)</li>
    <li> This has reduced breakage in my hair and my daughter&#x27;s.  It does not build up and can be applied to the hair and/or scalp daily.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, no harsh scent, stops breaking.  I encourage all &amp;#34;Naturals&amp;#34; to try it at least one time LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I love the product, and it has grown my hair back thick. I would advice anyone with bald hair to use.</li>
    <li> I used this product for about a month, and noticed that my hair started growing, and getting thicker. The only think i hate is the smell, but I am used to the smell since my hair seems to be nice, shiny, and longer.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT.MY HAIR IS REALLY GROWING BK FROM THIS PRODUCT.I AM OVERALL PLEASED WITH IT .I WILL CONTINUE TO BUY MORE OF IT.</li>
    <li> I am an AA women with fine, thin hair and my edges broke off due to traction alopecia. I purchased this castor oil after hearing about how great it is for regrowing edges. It did absolutely nothing to grow back my edges after 4 months of use, as a matter of fact my mom tried it and said it broke her edges off. So I don&#x27;t use it for that purpose. However it is great as a moisturizer/sealant for the hair. I just take a quarter sized dab and massage it into my hair before wrapping it at night twice a week or so, and it gives it that sleek, shiny healthy look and make it thicker. It absorbs quickly and surprisingly doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down like most other oils. Great for girls with thin/fine hair!</li>
    <li> This product really made my hair thick. Shared it with a friend who had Chemo and it helped her hair grow back.  Love it</li>
    <li> This product has been real good. In just two weeks I have notice such a huge difference. It has been a month and the bottle isnt half way and I use a lot.</li>
    <li> Well I have heard alot of good reviews about this product and so far I am not that impressed yet(it&#x27;s ok but I like it at the same time so far...First ill get to the negative of this product, the consistancy is not like other castor oils...I have read the reviews on this oil and from the reviews I had the impression that this castor oil was just too thick(thats what I like thick oil to seal the ends of my hair) but this oil is a bit watery compared to other brands of castor oils that I have used. And because this castor oil is not thick enough for me to seal my ends I had to purchase another brand to do the job. Now the positive so far is: I actually like the smell of this oil, I know that some people who reviewed this product did&#x27;t care for the smell but it smells good, it smells like roasted coffe beans..lol..but the smell does not linger so thats a plus as well. another positive that I like about this oil is that once I applied the oil to my scalp my scalp started to tingle..I was not expecting for this oil to give my scalp a nice tingling sensation..Now myself I am a big fan of tingling sensations on my scalp, it lets me know that somthing is going on...Most growth aides that I use have a tingling sensation(but this castor oil has my scalp tingling more than any other growth aid I have ever used, the tingling last for 15- 45 min..other growth aides last 2-5 min) and everytime I get the tingles a month later my hair sprouts with crazy growth...Now I am not sure if that tingling sensation that I am getting from this product means a month later ill have crazy growth but from past experiances with other growth aids(which has managed to aide in giving me growth to the point of achieving bra stap length afro textured hair) the tingling sensation usually means that I have purchased a damn good growth aide...So I am going to have to come back and do an update within a month or two if this product has givin me crazy growth...But so far the tingling is a plus..Another positive is that this oil alone makes my hair supper soft....it&#x27;s rare that a oil alone can make my curley, kinky, wavy hair so soft(besides my coconut oil)...So the positives out way the negatives so far but I really didn&#x27;t want to buy another castor oil after spending money on this item which is more expensive then other brands of castor oils. Now if I don&#x27;t get crazy growth from this oil then ill add that to my negative list ...as far as this item making my hair soft well my coconut oil does that as well...So basically when I update my review on this poduct in about a month or two maybe three, it will be about rather or not this item has givin me crazy results or some good growth results and if my hair has thickned up alot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: OK it&#x27;s been a month almost and this item does work very well, but here is the catch.....I also use BEE MINE sulfur serum with this oil and my hair has grown alot and has thickened up...so I will purchase this castor oil to work with my sulfur serum.....So this is a good product.itive is that this oil alone makes my hair supper soft....it&#x27;s rare that a oil alone can make my curley, kinky, wavy hair so soft(besides my coconut oil)...So the positives out way the negatives so far but I really didn&#x27;t want to buy another castor oil after spending money on this item which is more expensive then other brands of castor oils. Now if I don&#x27;t get crazy growth from this oil then ill add that to my negative list ...as far as this item making my hair soft well my coconut oil does that as well...So basically when I update my review on this poduct in about a month or two maybe three, it will be about rather or not this item has givin me crazy results or some good growth results and if my hair has thickned up alot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: OK it&#x27;s been a month almost and this item does work very well, but here is the catch.....I also use BEE MINE sulfur serum with this oil and my hair has grown alot and has thickened up...so I will purchase this castor oil to work with my sulfur serum.....So this is a good product.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. Very high quality and pure castor oil. I observed expected results within a month of using the oil</li>
    <li> I could not find this product in the drug store.  I like it for my hair and skin.  The smell is not overwhelming for me.</li>
    <li> Seller was great LOVED the item it really helped  me in my the peocess of regrowing my hair after some up &amp; down being natural I went natural not know how to take care of my hair because my hair was relexed for so long in my life so I had to get used to having short hair so try some JBCO &amp; grow some healthy real hair</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer. The Jamaican Black Castor Oil is great for a hot oil treatment. The smell isnt as bad as people make you think. To me it smells like other natural oils. You should definitely try it.</li>
    <li> THIS IS MY FAVORITE PRODUCT FOR MOISTURE FOR MY 4B/4C VERY DRY HAIR; I ALSO USE THIS PRODUCT IN MY DAUGHTER (AGE 10y) HAIR FOR THICKNESS!  I ONLY USE THIS PRODUCT (WASH-DAY) ON OUR SCALP AFTER OUR HAIR IS ABOUT 70% DRY........I RECEIVED MY PRODUCT WITHIN THE GIVEN DATE!  I DO PLAN ON ORDERING MORE FROM THIS COMPANY!!  DO THE RESEARCH FOR YOURSELF THIS IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT WITH SEVERAL USES, ALSO YOUTUBE HAS A COUPLE OF MIX REVIEWS ABOUT IT....BUT I WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! AMAZING RESULTS! this is a must of black hair care!!!! Apply to scalp every other day and your golden.</li>
    <li> Using JBCO a little over a month and I love it. A little goes a long way, and I have seen substantial amount of growth at my temple area which was almost bald. The very top of my head the hair was thinning as well but since using the JBCO my hair has started to grow there as well! I massage it in the areas of my hair that are thin 3x a week and add a dime size amount to my conditioner. I just started wearing my hair in its natural state 3/1/13, by cutting all the remaining perm off, too happy!</li>
    <li> So far this castor oil has been pretty good. I have applying it to my eyebrows with much success! My eyebrows are thicker already, my esthetician noticed immediately. I only rated it 4 stars because I&#x27;m still waiting to see what it does yo my edges. I&#x27;m still wearing braids so I can&#x27;t tell right now. It does appear heavy initially but then it made my hair very soft. There isn&#x27;t an odor and it wasn&#x27;t greasy or sticky.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my JBCO, and I was totally pleased with my purchasing experience!!! I look forward to future business. Service was fast and efficient.</li>
    <li> Smells terrible but gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about this product, but they were immediately excised. The oil was not overly thick as I had been told. Most and best of all there was no unpleasant odor. I would definitely buy it again and recommend it to a friend. The packaging was a little dense but it served its purpose and the bottle arrived safe, secure, and on time, what more can you ask.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product I think a week ago. I just started using it a few days ago. I tend to not use shampoo on my hair because ALL shampoos are very drying and it leaves my hair EXTREMELY dry, matted, and it breaks off. I have very curly (looks like ring curls) AA hair. Some weeks ago I decided for the first time ever to get my hair braided and it was hard for me to wash my hair every week like i&#x27;m used to. I finally took out my braids and washed my hair with Pantene. I figured I needed shampoo badly because my scalp was super itchy from the weave and I knew my hair wasn&#x27;t getting cleaned the way I wanted it to while I had the braids. Needless to say the Pantene left my hair so dry and mangled to my head that I wanted to cry!!! My curls had completely tangled all over my head. Well, I took an empty spray bottle I had lying around and mixed Almond Oil, Castor Oil, Water and a little bit of the Knot today Leave in Conditioner created by Kinky Curly hair care.  And all I can say is way! I was able to rub the mixture into my hair so well and I could just feel it working! I was able to comb through my hair with no problems or breakage. I know for a fact that It had to have been the Castor Oil because NOT KNOCKING KINKY CURLY but the leave in has NEVER detangled my hair. I just got it because I needed an all natural leave in. I believe it was the Castor Oil working with the Sweet Almond Oil. And GET THIS, I&#x27;ve been washing my face with nothing but CASTOR OIL. YES CASTOR OIL. I wet my face with warm water to open my pores and remove some makeup, then I apply a teaspoon of CO to my face and rub it in GOOOOOOD! It removes my makeup perfectly. After I&#x27;ve rubbed it in, I take my warm, wet face towel and wipe away the oil (I always clean my towel out with soap afterwards). Everyday my face looks healthier and it&#x27;s only been a few days with nothing but water and castor oil. I apply a little bit to my face and eyelashes at night. You won&#x27;t believe this but my stubby lashes are getting longer and thicker. I can&#x27;t believe it... I&#x27;m honestly stunned by the beauty effects of CO. It doesn&#x27;t smell lovely buy damn it works wonders!!</li>
    <li> This oil is thick but it is working for my hair. My have notice my hair my hair has become softer and a little thicker since using it. I am on a 3 month challenge with this oil. So far it is working for my hair. I would recommend you give it a try.</li>
    <li> Does what it says to do,i mix it with other essential oils to kill the smell,love,love,love it. Nuff said! Yes I will buy again,just wish they had a bigger size bottle...</li>
    <li> I love this castor oil it is great for keeping your hair.moisturized</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 2 month on my facial hair and am seeing result. I use is every morning before I go to work</li>
    <li> This stuff is a must have for anyone with natural hair, dreds, or ethnic hair in general. It only takes just a little bit, and you will notice results almost instantly. The main issue I was concerned with was dry scalp, itchiness, and the use of a product that wouldn&#x27;t weigh my dreds down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is thick out of the bottle, but if u apply a thin layer on the scalp directly after washing, by the time it dries your scalp will absorb the oil...it dosent leave a sticky residue, and after time u will notice healthier hair...even growth in balding areas. I don&#x27;t even have dry scalp anymore...it straight cured it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One complaint...it does have a very faint odd smell out of the bottle...yet a nice spritz of warm water mixed with peppermint oil does the trick nicely. Even without the spritzer...the smell goes away after a day anyway. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Great product. I use for me and my daughters hair. Fast shipping and packaged very well so that it isn&#x27;t damaged.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I have slow growing hair. Now. I had a spot on the top of my head where my hair was VERY thin and noticeably shorter than the rest of my hair, even with close cuts. I&#x27;d been trying to get that spot (about the size of a US $.50 coin) to grow for YEARS! As a matter of fact, it was the reason why I did the big chop back in 2000. So for literally 12+ years, I struggled with that one spot. Back in March of this year, I&#x27;d just come to the conclusion that I would keep my hair cut SUPER close just to keep that spot camouflaged.  Then someone suggested this product. Honestly, I rolled my eyes, because I&#x27;d tried almost EVERYTHING, different hair pomades, coconut oil, olive oil, hot oil treatments, various shampoos, braids (to give it a rest) this product, that product, the other product -  including regular castor oil, and nothing had worked.  Nonetheless, I figured, what the hey . . . I&#x27;ll try it as a last ditch effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once received, I&#x27;d dip my finger in the bottle and rub the oil into the area 2-3 times a week as suggested, which worked perfectly for me since I rarely use any one product consistently on a daily basis.  At the time, my hair surrounding the spot was already longer than the hair in that area, so I cut it all off (super close) to get all my hair on the same playing field - so the spot wouldn&#x27;t have to play catch up.  In two weeks time, I could see that the spot was growing better than it had before, however, it was still lagging behind the rest of my hair, so I did one more super close cut, but kept applying the oil. That was in April.  Since that time, my hair in that spot has completely filled in and was (and still is) growing at the same rate as the hair on the rest of my head. I haven&#x27;t had to cut it to try to hide that spot anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair still doesn&#x27;t grow as fast as I&#x27;d like it to, but it is thicker and more full than it has EVER been in the past 12 years. And there are NO almost-bald spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it only takes a \\&quot;dip\\&quot; of oil, I am still on my first bottle.</li>
    <li> It works! I use it for my daughter and her hair is growing so fast now, compared to other products used before.</li>
    <li> Very thick consistency. I thought that the bottle was small, but a little bit goes a long way. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> This product did work on a stress/thin spot. I have been using it for 3 weeks, and my hair has been growing all over, including that thin spot in my hair. I would recommend it for use.</li>
    <li> My castor oil came very quickly and I love it! This castor oil It keeps my hair very soft and moisturized, along with my other styling products.</li>
    <li> its an ok product. I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement with my hair but will continue to use it to evaluate.</li>
    <li> I use this oil all over my body. I use it on my hair and face. It leaves my skin smooth. It stops my scalp from itching. It is thick, so you only use a little and massage it on well.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Everyone I let try it, loves it. It shipped fast and was delievered fast. Simply AWESOME!</li>
    <li> This was my first castor oil purchase, I&#x27;ve read great reviews on it and decided to try it. I use it to cleanse my face, and strengthen my eye lashes and eye brows. So far so good, just placed another order.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work well with my hair because it caused my scalp to itch a lot however, when needed as a laxative, it was perfect!</li>
    <li> I had a thin patch in my hair and now after using the Jamaican black castor oil I can see that my hair has began growing back in that area. The oil is thick, so i use a dropper and massage it in my scalp. It has a smoky nutty smell but it is tolerable and it does make your hair grow.</li>
    <li> Not good on my hair, too heavy and oily.</li>
    <li> It has helped the edges in my hair grow back :)</li>
    <li> Great product, great price.</li>
    <li> Has helped significantly with my eczema outbreaks on my arm. I also am using on my scalp where to increase growth, have not yet seen a change, but have only been using for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> The package came on time, wasn&#x27;t damaged and was exactly what I ordered. I have used this product before and it worked great. I use it to moisturize my scalp. It works so well and even helped my dandruff.</li>
    <li> I love it!!! Specially now that I decided to grow my hair natural.</li>
    <li> Order this for my wife. After using it she notice a positive change and wondered what took her so long to check into this. The seller did a wonderful job packaging this for shipping. If you are thinking about this product and this seller well make that move and order it from them.</li>
    <li> Castor oil is a must have product in black households for the hair. I have been using castor oil since my days in Jamaica. It was one of the staple products that women in the countrysides of Jamaica use in their hair to treat it before and after a relaxer. A lot of people now think its strong but believe me growing up it was much stronger, i guess because it was done in a more natural way. It was so strong that i would smell it it in peoples hair the day after their relaxer lol. I never saw women with damage hair back then just a head full of thick healthy hair, so the smell does not bother me, as matter of fact whenever i smell castor oil I automatically think healthy thick hair, I kid you not. Castor oil can be found in Haiti, Trinidad and other countries. Because Jamaicans traditionally use castor oil as a hair treatment, thats why its call Jamaican castor oil but other countries has it aslo.</li>
    <li> The contents of this is just like what I remember Castor Oil was in Jamaica. I love it and it amazing on my hair. Helps to leave my hair soft and shinny. I&#x27;m now mixing this with coconut oil. The combo I used tonight left my hair feeling so soft and smooth that I don&#x27;t want to go to the gym and mess it up again but that&#x27;s now the beauty of fixing it back again.</li>
    <li> OK, just had to try this . Have been reading about it, so will give it a try . I have only used it three time so its to soon yet to see if its working. Have noticed that my nails are stronger</li>
    <li> Worked very well...gonna order more....</li>
    <li> I use this oil as a hot oil treatment. It is very thick so I try to make sure I only get it on the scalp. Overall I have seen progress with my hair.</li>
    <li> I love it. My ends are moist and strong.</li>
    <li> OKAY THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING. I PUT THIS ON AND IN ONE WEEK I WAS GROWING EYEBROW HAIRS I DIDNT KNOW I COULD GROW LOL. IT WORK GOOD FOR ME. IM BLACK HISPANIC. I DIDNT GIE IT A FIVE STAR BECAUSE WHEN I PUT THE PRODUCT ON I GOT SOME PIMPLES.</li>
    <li> I just went natural and since discovering this product and using it religiously my hair has been growing about half an inch to a full inch per month! It helps to research Castor Oil before using it, that&#x27;s probably why it&#x27;s been working so well for me. That and Hennaing my hair about twice a week. This stuff is great and it lasts a long time. Has a smoky smell, and does wonders for the ends of my hair. I do a Henna session and put this on the ends of my hair as soon as I finish a twist. My twists last for days and days and my hair is so soft and bouncy when I take them out. I love this stuff and swear by it.</li>
    <li> Can;t say if it does all that I purchased it for, because I have been to busy to test it consistently, but I received my order promptly and in good condition.  It will take a few months to see if it helps with the eyebrow issues that I have.</li>
    <li> I love this oil and it is one of the best healing oils. You can use for just about anything eczema which i do have, my hair, skin, elbows, knee&#x27;s anything! Initially i bought this for my hair and growth thickening and it has excelled. I use it to seal as well after my moustirizer and It is so thick I love its consistency I feel like its doing real good. Some people may not like the consistency of the oil but you can thin it by mixing it with other oils olive, jojoba etc. It smells kinda like charcoal or something burned or grounded but i honestly dont mind for all its nutrients and successes. Give a try definetly.</li>
    <li> I am locing my hair again.  I switch up between this and Nature Blessing&#x27;s Hair Pomade.  I use this at times when my hair is wet and would then twist (2 strand twist) my hair.  I sleep with a satin cap and my hair stays moist for several days</li>
    <li> Very effective. I  have seen a remarkable improvement . It has helped me grow my hairline. I will definitely recommend this product to those suffering from hair loss</li>
    <li> I rate this product so high due to the fast results I seen after 2 weeks of use I started seeing my hair grow slowly but this product does in fact work and I would recommend this product to anyone who has Alopecia just as I have I have used many products and this is the only product that I see some type of improvement.</li>
    <li> A great product. I use it on my scalp to relieve itching and dryness. Better than any grease I have used and will continue using Jamaican Black Castor oil.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product months ago, it arrived on time and it has done well on my hair. The scent isn&#x27;t that great, though. I would recommend this product and its distributor.</li>
    <li> Works well on edges. Restored my daughters dry and brittle hair. Use it to mix with lighter oils to make a pomeade.</li>
    <li> very good product, fast shipping, good for hair, but not noticed grow hair yet, but I will use it everyday and wait.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Item is exactly as described. Thank you will purchase again. Using this on my hair, haven&#x27;t been using long enough to document any progress.</li>
    <li> I bought this castor oil a couple years ago after hearing castor oil was good for acne. I used other brands of castor even organic brands and it seemed to help at first but then stop. I am allergic to salicylic acid so clearing a clogged pore is hard when you&#x27;re skin is so sensitive. I ordered this after seeing on the internet that Jamaican Black Castor Oil was better than regular castor oil. I ordered it and it works on unclogging my pores for the Oil Cleansing Method and for spot treatments. I love it so much this is my 5th bottle. It last me about half a year to 9 months but I love it. For hair growth it works too, I had issues before with over plucking my eyebrows. But since the &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; eyebrow trend came back I decided to grow them out. I tried everything including rosemary oil and so forth. I tried this every night with some coconut oil and it worked, But now I have too much hair lol. But if you have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t handle acids, try this. It will unclog the pore and bring the blackhead out. For hair it works but since I am of Mexican Descent I have plenty of it. So I recommend you give it a try. All good things....take time, remember that. ;)</li>
    <li> Known for growing hair.  Healthy for the hair.  Use a perm application bottle and administer on the scalp.  It will flow through the scalp onto the hair.  Lasts awhile throughout the scalp and hair.  The smell is not a fragrant or medicinal, but it won&#x27;t give off any type of negative odor.  Hair has grown since purchasing and beginning to use along with normal hair growth.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed. It didn&#x27;t do anything for me. Will not buy again.I was really excited to receive this product and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it, but now it has been a month and i havent seen any good results.</li>
    <li> The smell um not so nice like a astray. Idk if its the way jojoba oil smells but its kind of strong.hopefully I can mix it with some essential oils to altr the smell, I do like the thickness of it.</li>
    <li> Hate the smell, but works great! Growing my edges back :) happy nappy head</li>
    <li> Dreadful scent....way too strong to even use so I have no review of how it works.  Let&#x27;s hope those of you who can stomach the scent can review and tell us about your results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave my entire bottle away to a lady who wanted it!!  Yuk!!!</li>
    <li> Very thick oil, and helps the hair from breakage. Helps grow hair and thickens it. Cool product to use. Awesome</li>
    <li> Nice product with on time delivery.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I like the thick stickiness of it. The smell is meh.</li>
    <li> i have had a bad hair line or should i just say no hairline for many many years and since i started using JBCO my hair has recovered. full hairline, healthy hair overall and a bit faster hair growth too- i just love it. My hair is no longer brittle and it no longer sheds, it is strong shiny and just perfect. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this so much.My hair is growing very fast.Im very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I like the lavender black castor oil better because of the smell.  The original one is very very strong.  I purchase the lavender one and like it better the smell is a little softer.  It is very thick, so a little go a long ways. I have noticed some growth around the edges of  but not significant.</li>
    <li> Smells weird, but it absolutely works!</li>
    <li> It broke my face out... but was fine on my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> It broke me out into tiny pimples on my scalp. But I think if your skin isn&#x27;t sensitive like mine, it will work wonders for you.</li>
    <li> Not great for what I needed it for.</li>
    <li> After having thin hair for a while, I have been using this product for about a month and am having new hair growth.</li>
    <li> It came in a plastic bottle. Last time it was glass. I like glass better</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this for my edges since I am losing hair there. I have been using this product for almost a year and the hair has grown back just a little. I am very happy with this product since I was practically bald on one side but with this product my hair has grown in a little bit. Nothing else has worked for me. I am a 26 y/o Hispanic woman and love, love, love the product.</li>
    <li> Used it for my hair and eyebrow. They grew really fast. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the best castor oil I have used. It really has helped my scalp health and my hair is no longer falling out in droves.</li>
    <li> I have been using for months and notice some hair growth, I will continue to order and use this healing oil.  It does work but you need to be patient and continue to use for years.</li>
    <li> This really works great I always buy from amazon. The prices are good amd the product works. And I love the books too I buy them as well</li>
    <li> This product does work, well at lease for me. Using it on my edges and it is growing them quickly. I use it once a day, every night.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used thiss product before but it has been a while. I noticed that it doesn&#x27;t have the barbecue, smokey smell anymore which makes me think it may not be as good. O&#x27;well I shall find out my hair is in braids so no update yet!</li>
    <li> My hair loves castor oil! Helps prevent my scalp from becoming irritated and sensitive. I also use it on my edges.</li>
    <li> Extremely Disappointed. I have been using Tropic Isle Jamaican Black Castor oil for years. And the product I received was NOT authentic JBCO. Tropic Isle Jamaican Black Castor Oil comes in an amber &amp;#34;GLASS&amp;#34; bottle NOT a plastic one, as it can cause degradation of product. I even called to Tropic Isle to confirm this. I will not be ordering from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time! Love the product!</li>
    <li> OMG shipping was super fast, I ordered on Sunday and it arrived in the mail today (Wednesday)! I haven&#x27;t used it yet; this stuff smells pretty gross, but I&#x27;ve seen this work for many people so I hope it works for me!</li>
    <li> I am a natural and i use this for my hair as a laxative and this works great! the taste is very disgusting but it was worth it in the end. It adds moisture to my hair (my hair is veryyy coarse) and works wonderfully! I hope u try it because you will be happy in the end :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still using and have not seen the effect that I&#x27;m looking for yet.  Will be ordering another bottle soon!</li>
    <li> This oil has so many uses - but I use this on my scalp. This is wonderful for hair growth and strengthening plus it&#x27;s a great moisturizer! Just rub this on the scalp a couple of times a day and you will be AMAZED! This oil is thick and not runny, if you don’t like the smell or thickness you can mix with other carrier oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a severe hair loss issue and using this oil helped me grow my hair back in a couple of months! Consistency is the KEY! I LOVE it and would highly recommend it to anyone. If you find yourself getting bumps on your scalp, undiluted may be too strong for you.  Simply mix other olive, jojoba or another oil to ease the sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used NUMEROUS brands of Regular Castor and Black Castor Oil - just look for 100% or pure and you can&#x27;t go wrong with either type or brand. I have indeed posted reviews on different brands because I have used these brands.  I use castor oil on my hair and my daughters’ hair and I mix my own hair products so I buy several brands as long as they are 100% / pure castor.  I hope this review helps!!</li>
    <li> Very thick and bad smell but I&#x27;ve heard it works wonders. Haven&#x27;t gotten passed the initial issues to use it much honestly.</li>
    <li> Works well on hair also I use it on my eyelashes and eyebrows and they have grown . I use it on my waist length hair and my hair loves it</li>
    <li> it works wonders..&lt;br /&gt;its like very thick and has a smokey smell, but all in all the product did thicken my hair a bit.</li>
    <li> I heard a lot about this product so I had to see for myself what the hype was all about. I used it in my grand daughters hair and it worked wonders for her. Her hair is more manageable and is growing very well. I also started using it on mine as well and I love the fact that it helps with the dry scalp and adds shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product!!!</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF IS ABSOLUTELY GREAT. IT IS A LITTLE THICK AND THE SMELL IS NOT THE BEST. HOWEVER, IT DOES THE JOB QUITE NICELY. MY EDGES OF MY HAIR HAVE BEEN RESTORED AND IT EVEN FILLED IN SOME PATCHES THAT WERE THIN THROUGHOUT MY HAIR. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE INTERESTED IN GROWING THEIR EDGES BACK AFTER A HAIRSTYLE THAT HAS GONE BAD~</li>
    <li> Shipping fast to France. Arrived quicker than expected!&lt;br /&gt;Read a lot of good reviews but my progession seems a little slow for me. Used it in combinaison with emu oil.&lt;br /&gt;Still  I do see some progress</li>
    <li> This castor oil is amazing! It coats the hair making it healthy &amp; soft, it is also amazing on the skin. It is a must have</li>
    <li> I using this product since transitioning from perm to natural. 6mon. JBCO keep my hair moisturize, and I also see where its thicken up especially around my edges. Works wonders for me.</li>
    <li> I definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my hair since april 2012&lt;br /&gt;and I&#x27;m really satisfied. buy it !</li>
    <li> Currently using it to try to grow my edges back. Seems to be helping.</li>
    <li> I definitely see results with this product! Will be ordering again...</li>
    <li> I appreciated how quickly I received my oil but I noticed the oil was a bit runny and not as thick as the black jamaican oils I usually use. Also, I didn&#x27;t see any ash inside the oil that I have always seen when I have purchased my oil from the local hair supply store. This had no ash. It made me doubt if this was the extra dark oil as they are advertising.</li>
    <li> Arrived quick but I feel it&#x27;s a bit pricey. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, although I haven&#x27;t been using it like others say you should, apparently massage it into your scalp every night. I personally have been using it kind of as needed, the oil is so thick you really don&#x27;t need to use it every night and as a hot oil treatment every week to every other week but the smell is awful. No changes around my edge line (sole purpose of purchasing it) but the length is definitely growing so I will be purchasing another bottle. Will try massaging it everyday &amp; as a hot oil treatment to see if there&#x27;s a difference so I&#x27;ll do another update then.</li>
    <li> Delivery was fast and I have no complaints about the product at this time.I may follow up later with progress on my hair growth.</li>
    <li> did not like this product it took my hair out real bad I will not buy this product again not good</li>
    <li> Love it ....I&#x27;m going natural and this helps the process. It&#x27;s great for edges. And your scalp keeping  it moisturized and healthy....</li>
    <li> Been using about a week now and already see new hair coming in. Think might be answer to my prayers.</li>
    <li> Thanks for an impeccable service. Jamaican Black castor oil  is the best oil I have use to thicken my hair.</li>
    <li> i AM UNSURE OF WHAT i EXPECTED, BUT LIKE THE FEEL OF THE PRODUCT.  PERHAPS A LONGER USE WILL RESULT IN THE DESIRED OUTCOME</li>
    <li> This is a good product just use a small amount</li>
    <li> It has only been about three weeks. I have seen some results ,but  after using it for maybe 2 months or so, I will be able to tell better. It is doing great from my skin. I ready purchased it for my hair, but I am using it on my face as well. I will report in again after about 2or 3 months for my hair.  So far ,I am pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> So far so good, haven&#x27;t use it for two long. However I can tell my hair is getting thicker</li>
    <li> It fits good with great support but the bras have a smell that does not wash out. Please do not dry it because it increases the rubber smell. I saw online to wash and let it dry outside it does seem to help tremendously but does not eliminate the odor. Im giving it a 3 star because of the smell.</li>
    <li> Is very moisturizing a little thick , but very nice. I put it on my eye lashes and noticed growth</li>
    <li> I am really seeing results after using this on my edges!</li>
    <li> Great product. It&#x27;s been working great, combined with my other oils (coconut, olive, Now&#x27;s sweet almond amd lavendar &amp; pepperment). The scent isn&#x27;t as horrific as some people make it out to be, I wear it both day and night. It has tremendously improved the discoloration of my elbows from typing and leaning against things. In addition, to my hairline. Plus, you can drink it for a clean bowel movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative aspect of this purchase is that the shipper did not sufficiently wrap the package safely, and the cap came broken; however, none of the oil leaked out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this stuff!  This is a wonderful product for blending with other oils and making a scalp massaging oil to encourage fast hair growth as well as fuller soft hair.  Also, it is wonderful to blend with natural body, skin and hair oils AND to apply to wounds to speed up healing and reducing scars.</li>
    <li> I received my product in a timely manger and it was exactly what I expected. I will be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for about a week,  no funny smell as some reported and I even put it on my skin.  I received my products very quickly,  so great service.</li>
    <li> Just got it, and I am already sold! :) The consistency of it is amazing. So thick and moisturizing. Im not going to use it on my scalp, because I feel like its going to be too heavy. But my ends love love it! I do twistouts with this oil, and my ends have never looked so fly. Its a keeper!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Its great on my scalp and it has definitely put a stop to the flakiness!  I also love rubbing it on my hands, cuticles, elbows and feet.  Best of all - a little goes a LONG way!  The only reason it does not get 5 stars is because of the price.  Way to expensive for me.  Especially, when I can get plain old castor oil at Walgreens or CVS for 3.99.</li>
    <li> ATTENTION ALL NATURALS. DONT THINK. PURCHASE. THIS HAS TOTALLY CHANGED MY LIFE LOL. IM SERIOUS. MY HAIR HAS NEVER BEEN MORE SOFT OR MOISTURIZED ALL DAY. YOU KNOW ITS REALLY GOOD IF IM WRITING A REVIEW. WHO ACTUALLY DOES THESE.&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions about how I used it you can dm me on twitter (@dannibydesign)&lt;br /&gt;If someone told me this was exactly how my hair would be, I would pay 50$ for it. No price on this for me.</li>
    <li> All the good things that I&#x27;ve heard about this product are true. I use it on head hair, beard &amp; mustache. I have very black hair and this oil makes them look even more black and full of volume. Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t if im not doing something right but this didn&#x27;t work for me and I thought I had found something that would help grow my hair back but I guess I&#x27;ll have to keep trying</li>
    <li> The smell is quite...it&#x27;s quite- interesting, but this is a great product! I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is less dry/damaged looking, it looks and feels stronger and healthier. Will be buying more when I&#x27;m out!</li>
    <li> I just received my oil and I just used it once today. I am not giving 3 stars on the over all product but only on how thick and how bad it smells. If you were looking to try this on your hair you should know that it is extremely thick to the point that it feels thicker than cooking grease oil. So putting that through your hair may feel too heavy. I think I will only rub it through my scalp and a little on my ends. Because of how thick it is , I won&#x27;t be using this as a everyday moisturizing oil. Also, the smell is horrible. It literally smells like dirt oil. Which also wouldn&#x27;t be good to be applying through your hair unless you don&#x27;t mind walking pass someone and smelling like an old car needing a oil change. 3 stars on these two topics because it really limits me on wanting to use it. I have yet to see how the product actually works. Maybe that will change my mind.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I read that it will help my eyebrows grow back.  my eyebrows are thin because of a thyroid condition.  well, heck my eyebrows are growing back.  thank you.  it&#x27;s not an overnight thing folks, but slowly but surely you will see the hairs coming up.</li>
    <li> so far I have only used it as a arm pit moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Great product! Makes my hair thick!</li>
    <li> ordered for a second time.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff. My hair has done wonderful using this product. Just know that it is a thick oil. I mix it with other oils and creat my iwn oil concuction that works for me. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Love this oil, but it is costly in comparison to the NOW brand and what you can get for your money.  When I have it I can splurge a bit but for the most part may purchase one bottle per year.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great I even use it as a moisturizer under my eyes and for my brows that once was sparse but not they seem to be filling in a little bit.</li>
    <li> Works great with my hair.</li>
    <li> An amazing oil. Only con, is the scent. It&#x27;s mild so tolerable for me</li>
    <li> Love this product! Itnhas a very rich texture.  Works great on skin and hair!</li>
    <li> Whipped this in a hair mask with Shea Butter and Coconut Oil.  The blend seemed moisturizing for my hair.  The Castor Oil does have a strong smell, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any bad smell in my hair.  It works well blended with other oils and butters.  Would buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> This product works wonders for my natural hair. The shipper of this product is exceptional. I placed my order midday Tuesday and received my order on Thursday.</li>
    <li> To early to tell if it does what it says. Suppose to help with hair growth</li>
    <li> the jamican  blackcastior ilove it make my hair very thick and very black</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks.. i haven&#x27;t seen any changes as of yet..  but i am staying positive.</li>
    <li> THIS OIL MOISTERIZES MY HAIR AND GIVES IT NEW LIFE.  IT HELPED PROMOTE GROWTH WHEN I WAS COMING OUT OF A PERM.  I THOUGHT MY HAIR WAS THROUGH BUT THIS OIL BROUGHT IT BACK TO LIFE.</li>
    <li> Love it good for hair and skin</li>
    <li> I mix the Jamaican black castor oil with some of my other oils and I also use it in my soaps.</li>
    <li> This is my first time purchasing this product and I fell in love with it the moment I put it on my skin. It was absorbed pretty quickly for the thickness of the oil. It does have a very distinctive scent. I believe that it is acquired because while I hear a lot of people say they hate the smell, for some reason I enjoy it. Smells like sesame seed oil or peanut oil. However, I am HIGHLY allergic to peanuts and it does not bother my skin at all. THANK GOD! I also put some in my hair but it hasnt been long enough for me to see any hair growth or changes. But my skin looks and feels awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product came well packaged and fast too!</li>
    <li> So far so good I already see new growth and I love the thick texture it keeps my hair moist</li>
    <li> Love this it&#x27;s great for the hair.</li>
    <li> Growing my hair in the areas where was going think</li>
    <li> I love this oil. This is my second purchase and I think I will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!! It&#x27;s true a little goes a long way. I found that it is best to mix it with something like Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie. When I used it by itself it irritated my skin. Keeps the hair really moist.</li>
    <li> I love the hot oil treatment the product is wonderful</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. It does stink. But i already knew that. As long as I use a little bit it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> I love the Jamaican Black Castor oil, It&#x27;s a multi purpose oil. I use it in my hair and on my skin. On burns, and around my cuticles.</li>
    <li> Since I have been using this product  for over a year, I know longer&lt;br /&gt;get dandruff due to my dry hair especially in the winter. It keeps&lt;br /&gt;my moist and  my hair can be combed easier.</li>
    <li> Product was damaged awaiting replacement</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this product on my natural hair to help thicken my hair and to repair a bald spot. So far it&#x27;s working!</li>
    <li> This keeps my daughters hair soft and shiny. I have used two bottles in the past year. A little goes a long way. I sometimes mix it with virgin coconut oil and it&#x27;s a great concoction for my natural hair</li>
    <li> New to this product, so I hope I get some great results.  The shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Love this oil, makes my hair and skin feel good.</li>
    <li> This Jamaican Castor oil is so great it does wonders for growth and I will be ordering more soon like today...Thank You</li>
    <li> Ordered it, for my naturally curly hair, only down is i didnt know the product was that thick, so i have to mix with other oils before i put it on mu hair, other than that, it a good product for natural hair.</li>
    <li> I was told about this product through my natural hair page. I had a BC IN June and began using JBCO around October. The hair growth is tremendous and I love the moisture and shine it gives my hair. Its a bit thick and the smell isn&#x27;t the best but its bearable, so I mix it with a bit of my conditioner (Herbal Essence Hello Hydration). I would buy again, as a matter of fact I did!</li>
    <li> I really like the jamaican castor oil its a great product. I would highly recommend this product to anyone. You can use for your hair and body.</li>
    <li> The first time I received this product I had issues with shipping and customer service was very accommodating. However the first bottle was thicker and more potent. This bottle was less potent and smaller than the first. I believe this product was cut with a finer oil. Perhaps because this product has become more popular and higher in demand, but that does not mean the quality of the product should be sacrificed. They will lose consumers that way. If you can go to an authentic Jamaican shop or find a trusted source you can see for yourself if you do a comparison.</li>
    <li> I had actually been using the NOW Brand of castor oil with great success before switching to this brand after I ran out. I made the switch based on this having just as glowing reviews as NOW Brand (but slightly more of them) and this being heavily endorsed on many black hair care discussion forums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad this works so well for others but my hair hated this and rebelled against me. I started shedding like crazy after continued use. A problem I never, ever experienced with NOW. I could kick myself for not putting 2 and 2 together and not realizing this was what was causing my excessive shedding. It wasn&#x27;t until after a stopped using it and the shedding came to a standstill and then I picked up this bottle and starting using it and the shedding came back in full force did I realize this was the culprit. Unfortunately, I had already lost about 1/3 or more of my hair&#x27;s thickness by than. Another thing I noticed about this product is that it has some impurities to it. Maybe that is what causes it to be black? I always put my castor oil in a thin tipped dispenser bottle usually used for color application, which makes it super easy to apply. Anyway, I noticed that there would be some black sediment at the bottom of the bottle. Yuck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This experience did teach me that everything ain&#x27;t for everybody. I am glad it works for so many. I am just not one of them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot about this product on YouTube and decided to try it.. Only used it for a week . It seems ok but I wear a straight extensions and its too oily , so I applied the oil only on my edges . Its thick so no need to put a lot on. I will have to try on my nature hair inbetween installs.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife cuz she always talk bout this item, it had been month and the half since i got it. she is really happen with it, she said it really word. thanks guys for this beautiful oil. I will b ordering more...</li>
    <li> Works great. I use it for my hair, although it&#x27;s a little too thick for my hair type, i mix it with pure coconut oil.</li>
    <li> I love this oil for my thick curly hair.  I wear wash and gos almost every day and this oil really keeps my hair shiny &amp; frizz free.  Even though it&#x27;s kinda thick/heavy - this is good stuff!!! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;N.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it is really thick and i feel like it doest a great job to cleanse my scalp.</li>
    <li> Im a returning customer and I just love this castor oil! I use it generously on my hair and face once a week in winter and may be once a month in summer..it keeps my eczema and dandruff away and more importantly dermatologist away!! Even my dermatologist was surprised to hear that I got away my eczema and dandruff by using this castor oil and he even said that he will recommend to his other patients as well!!</li>
    <li> This product did not warrant me buying it.  I did not feel that it had any redeeming use for me. I could not favorably recommend this product at this time.</li>
    <li> very pleased with delivery time and the product has seemed to be giving the results i was hoping for. people have noticed a difference. My only complaint, packaging was very oily, and I feel I may have lost some of the oil, not enough go through the hassel of returning it. I have recommemded to my friends.</li>
    <li> Love it for my hair! it makes it grow so much! It&#x27;s thick and it can get everywhere, but it still great!</li>
    <li> I wanted this product to work so bad But just like other reviewers it thinned my edges even more and caused overall shedding which is the opposite effect of what I needed it for. I don&#x27;t understand how other reviewers had such positive results unless I got a bad batch</li>
    <li> I use this product regularly and it agrees with my hair. it was thinning and it has grown back to it&#x27;s original thickness.  I would recommend this product.  I like using it because it brings my hair back to its original natural state. I have just searched and purchased more bottles in the sale. (It can be very expensive to buy individually from £16 for an 8oz bottle) but if you are determined to look for deals it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I got this to try on my eyebrows and lashes after being scared straight away from Latisse. I have been using it for about 90 days, and - IT WORKS. My eyebrows have filled in and my lashes are.. !!  Not much thicker but I would say almost twice as long as they were, especially the bottom ones - !  I don&#x27;t need to use eyeliner anymore, and not much mascara either. Latisse is, what? $125 and can cause severe irritation and - can actually cause brown specs and changes to your eye color?!  THIS castor oil (I cannot vouch for any other brand) will last for the rest of my life, probably - I apply it with a small filbert artist&#x27;s brush to the base of my lashes and to my eyebrows, and dab off the excess with a tissue before bed. Took maybe a month to really start seeing a change but now - I cannot believe the difference! It almost looks ridiculous to put mascara on now - over the top, but my lashes are pale so I need the color. Don&#x27;t waste your money or risk your eye health on Latisse - this is a tiny fraction of the cost, it&#x27;s natural, and it really, really works. Make sure you get the kind with NO SALT.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I mix it with jojoba oil and tea tree oil. I apply this daily to my scalp with a focus on my edges. It has definitely helped my edges grow back. I am pleased and I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> It came quicker then i thought it was and everything is good i would order again</li>
    <li> Have not seen any results yet. Will continue to use entire bottle.</li>
    <li> it does work but not how i thought it would.</li>
    <li> I love this castor oil.  I was researching and seen that this is supposed to help promote growth for your hair.  It is very thick and has a distinctive scent to it.  I will be using this again.</li>
    <li> This oil really works well in thickening my hairline after it broke off from me pulling my hair back too often and it keeps my hair and skin well moisturized during the cold winter months. It&#x27;s pretty thick, so I like to reduce it with extra virgin olive oil or virgin coconut oil.</li>
    <li> I like this product... I have purchased other Castor Oil&#x27;s for my hair but this seems to add that extra amount of oil needed for my hair. My scalp feels better and my hair looks like&#x27;s it&#x27;s growing. The smell is smoky but I masked it with coconut oil. All I can say is, it works for me.</li>
    <li> Will recommend for natural hair growth/length, thickness,edges.Product has to be mixed with other oils because of consistency.Very good for hot oil treatment.</li>
    <li> Packaged well and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Great product that has made my hair more healthy. Product was as described and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Love this product. The smell isn&#x27;t too pleasing but it goes away after a few minutes.</li>
    <li> It gets the job dooone</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I put it on my eyebrows to help them grow since they are thinning. I also make a massage oil mixture with oil of oregano to help with my 5 year olds growing pains. I massage it on his legs before bed and he doesn&#x27;t wake up screaming in the middle of the night.</li>
    <li> I use it for my hair and skin and I have had amazing results! I will always buy this stuff! Love it!</li>
    <li> I use this oil in my hair and the sheen it gives off is amazing. It really helps my hair retain moisture. I started putting it in everything from conditioners to styling products. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is becausese this oil smells very smoky. It loses the smell after application, but it is a little off putting initially.</li>
    <li> Feels wonder in my leave in conditioner for my hair.  This along with the other items keep my hair moist &amp; healthy.</li>
    <li> I have bought this greeat oil over and over I am never disappointed. It helps thicken hair, penetrates the hair shaft to create a shiny healthier coat of hair. MY mom saw how my hair line is growing back thicker after using this oil. My hair was braided too tight and pulled out the oil help fix balding spots. I also used it to make sure my scalp doesn&#x27;t get dry from dandruff. I loveeee this stuff it&#x27;s genius!!</li>
    <li> Super thick emollient. A little goes a very long way. It&#x27;s a great addition to creams and butters for kinky hair.</li>
    <li> my hair feels softer and the breakage has reduced a lot hopefully now i can retain more length. i will purchase more in the future</li>
    <li> This was a perfect purchase. The packaging was a little weird and it smelled a little weird. But since it got here safely I have nothing  to complain about. I haven&#x27;t really seen any results but the product is what its supposed to be so I&#x27;m happy!&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> Love the fact that doesnt leave my hair greasy and I can use a moderate amount everyday on my edges. Great product.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell so pretty but it works for what I bought it for; hair care. I add a little to my scalp and put on a plastic cap before I wash. I also tried adding it in with my conditioner. I noticed an improvement and some commented on my hair looking thicker. I&#x27;m going to get better at routine usage so I can up the benefits.</li>
    <li> I had allergic reactions to the oil on my scalp.  Bad news.</li>
    <li> product doesnt smell good but... i think it works. it leaves a good sheen in my hair. so... i  would recommend.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes your skin so very soft just a small drop and WOW!  Rub your feet, elbows and knees with it after a shower and you will fall in love! Add a few drops to your hair product too.</li>
    <li> Product is amazing!!!!!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Good stuff and doesn&#x27;t have any odor.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my natural hair ( to whip into my Shea butter mix), but let me tell ya...this castor oil is super thick.  I should have only used 1/2 teaspoon when I used about a tablespoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the smell....honey someone said it smells like coconuts.....eeeh wrong.  Stuff so strong it could knock you out!</li>
    <li> Fast shipment. Product shipped just as described.</li>
    <li> very pleased with this product</li>
    <li> I would never ever buy this product again, it made my head itchy and my scalp broke out in scabs... Buyers Beware!!</li>
    <li> My hair is soft and looks great! I would recommend this product especially if you live in a dry climate. Love it!</li>
    <li> USING THIS ON MY HAIR. JUST STARTED USING IT</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really working for me, I had an area on my head where the hair was sort of thin but is now much more filled out.</li>
    <li> Great product my hair is Thicker than before.</li>
    <li> I love jbc for my natural hair, my hair has less breakage , thick &amp; healthy wont style my hair without this product!</li>
    <li> Fast service. I am using this oil and it seems my broken edges around my hairline are growing in again. Some one told me it would help regrow hair, this is why I purchased it. I see on the label it is suppose to do quite a few things. Well so far so good.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I bought the 4oz, because I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but it really made my hair grow! You see a lot of products that say will make your hair grow, but don&#x27;t, but this does. I had did the HCG diet, which works, but the second time I did it, I put oil in my hair, because black people need oil on their scalp, but you can&#x27;t use oil on your hair.  Once I was off of the HCG, my hair stop growing and it was breaking. After a year nothing. It was still short, so I saw this product and that&#x27;s how I started using this after reading the reviews. I just order my second bottle, a 8oz this time. It makes your hair soft and helps with breakage, not more breakage. My perm last longer now.  If you need your hair to grow, use this product. You won&#x27;t regret it, believe me.</li>
    <li> Beautiful mix with my other products.</li>
    <li> Good product - met expectations</li>
    <li> I am taking this to grow some hair in my beard and on my hairline. I am def seeing more growth in both areas. It&#x27;s not complete yet, but so far I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Be very aware of knock off products, so I heard before my purchase and I wish I had not wasted my money. I&#x27;m sure the Jamaican Black Castor Oil I purchased is not the real deal. The bottle I received is made of plastic, the oil a bit runny, no scent what so ever and a light, almost transparent honey colored like shade of brown and strangely enough, their was no seal over the lid. I&#x27;ve heard this product works nothing but miracles but I would not recommend you make your purchase of this product on Amazon. Just save yourself a lot of hassle and make your purchase from their official website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I think it would be important to add that, I have not officially confirmed the bottle will not work, however there is enough sustainable evidence to support the claim that my purchase is indeed a knock off.&lt;br /&gt;If I see any results after one week I will respond with my reply.</li>
    <li> Helping a lot with my edges growing back. Hair weaving glue is to blame I had a bad reaction to it and caused my scalp to bleed and some hair loss.  I&#x27;m taking this and also my Biotin and my Hair skin and nails vitamins.  I notice growth coming in!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say yet if it will help my hair, but I like the richness of the oil.</li>
    <li> When applying this product I noticed the huge change to my scalp. My hair was very moisturize and my scalp wasn&#x27;t dry or flaky after washing my hair. I can&#x27;t remember the last time that my scalp was itchy , dry, or flaky since using Jamaican black castor oil.  It has been almost a month that I have been using this oil and I&#x27;m already seeing new growth on my color treated natural hair.</li>
    <li> I used this hoping it would make my hair thicker and stop it from falling out. This oil was too thick and heavy on my fragile hair so when I applied it and massaged it through I it would leave hairs tangled in my fingers. I even tried mixing it with a lighter oils like coconut to thin out the thickness in the castor oil. It made np difference. I left it on over night about two three times and the morning after I felt that half my hair came out. This scared me to death so I am no longer using it. The only positive I&#x27;ve seen was that it made my hair longer faster, but I was looking for thickness not length. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed because this was my last hope.</li>
    <li> Yes I love it, so far so good, as a Jamaican myself I know castor oil 8s good for the hair so I will continue to buy it and use it</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews for this product, I decided to make the purchase. I started using this product one month ago, I use it for scalp massages and to seal the ends of my hair.  Please note that if you have fine hair, this product will make your hair feel thick and full, as for growth I haven&#x27;t noticed any.  This product when used in small amounts is good for helping you retain your length when using it to seal the ends of your hair. I had great results mixing the JBCO with my regular conditioner and 30 minutes under heatcap, its really coats and softens when used as a deep conditioner.  Warning do not get heavy handed with this product, your hair will be SUPER greasy and weighed down.  All in all, okay product, JBCO is an heavy oil and has protected my hair against the harsh winter cold.</li>
    <li> I was so excited! I saw new growth in two days! Love it but not the smell so I added some other natural oils to it. Will be ordering more soon!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed extreme results yet but I&#x27;m keeping hope alive.</li>
    <li> I use this oil on my hair.  I have second degree burns on my face, eyebrows, eyelashes and hair.  After one week of use on my hair, I can see a difference.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This does have a woodsy smell, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it smelled. The oil is rather heavy, so you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of the product. This will mess up your sheets, there is no way to sugar coat it. It really did work as a hair thicker on my already thick 3c/4a 12 inch hair!</li>
    <li> I purchase this oil for some co worker and they have mention to me they like it and one person have seen some results from using this product.</li>
    <li> I originally ordered the JBCO in the 4oz bottle &amp; used it all. I love this product &amp; I wasn&#x27;t aware it was available in the 8oz size. I will continue to purchase the 8oz sizes to get more longevity of usage and I&#x27;m considering purchasing the Lavender version in 8oz and possibly the coconut , which is only offered in 4oz. This product has made a difference in my natural hair journey ...where I&#x27;m a newbie. I&#x27;m so happy with the prognosis, that I have been spreading the word about JBCO to my family &amp; friends. Do invest because it has an amazing ROI (rerurn on investment ).</li>
    <li> Wish i purchased a larger amount</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  Will purchase again in larger ounces.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair soft but I do not see any growth. The sellers shippped really fast so that was a plus. Good on your hair and skin!</li>
    <li> Amazing.........love for both me and my daughters hair needs !!!! We def buy this product again &lt;3 and so many different products to choice plus my shipping was free !!!!</li>
    <li> This is amazing for dry hair.  It cuts down on the breakage and makes my hair shiny, but is not heavy.  I have natural hair and haven&#x27;t found anything that works until now.  The smell could be better, but I spray oil sheen on my hair to cover the scent.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s great! arrived early and is exactly as described</li>
    <li> It keep my skin oiled and I use it to oil my 7 mth old head..works good will buy again</li>
    <li> I kept reading reviews and watching natural hair care videos and of course this product kept coming up so I eventually decided to try it. I never liked the drug store castor oil because it weighed my hair down. I am a black woman with natural hair living in the tropics and working in an air conditioned office all day and I find that this Black Castor oil does wonders for keeping my hair shiny and moisturized. I just lightly spritz some water and massage the oil throughout and it is perfect. It does have a bit of an ashy smell but that doesn&#x27;t bother me any, that&#x27;s the smell of goodness! and it isn&#x27;t noticeable once you massage it into the hair, unless you probably use an unnecessary &amp; ridiculous amount. Which is another thing that makes it so worth it; the fact that the 8 oz bottle will last and last, I&#x27;ve been using one bottle for 2 months now and it is just about a third of the way down so I know it will last for quite a while still and I got 3 bottles my first order so I&#x27;m set!</li>
    <li> I mistakenly ordered this thinking it was a castor oil shampoo - oops! However, I still had a supply of my old castor oil shampoo ([[ASIN:B003KIU14O Tropic Isle Jamaican Black Castor Oil Shampoo, 8 Ounce]]) so I used this product for additional oil application. I am a mixed race woman (mistaken as Caucasian often) but my hair is baby fine and thinning really badly. Over the years I&#x27;ve been looking for a gentle shampoo and hair treatment to prevent further hair fall and breakage. Heard some good things about castor oil and figured I would give this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is oil, make no mistake about it. I applied some for the first time during a shower, and I was a little too liberal. My hair dried very greasy and nasty looking. However, with some care, I&#x27;ve taken to applying it with my current shampoo in roughly half/half and the results are nice. The Tropic Isle Shampoo is very strong and dries my hair very quickly (even though my hair and scalp is naturally oily). Adding the castor oil has helped to offset the shampoo and leaves my hair feeling very soft. It also helps combing my hair to be easier with the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it is pretty costly, and the smell isn&#x27;t a selling point. I don&#x27;t have much of a problem with requiring scents in my hair care products, but this is no Herbal Essences. Be prepared to have an unusual oily smell when you use it.</li>
    <li> Product as described...  I love it, definitely will be purchasing again. I use the oil in my daily hair routine.</li>
    <li> I bought this bottle of castor oil for my brother, he itches a lot and since he is using the castor oil, he hasn&#x27;t had anymore problems he is very happy that I  told him to try this castor oil and his skin is also happy.</li>
    <li> I read and watched all the videos about how wonderful this oil was, and I was very disappointed.  I could deal with the smell, which is not easy to adjust to.  But it also gave me a headache.  I don&#x27;t know whats in this stuff, but whew, I can&#x27;t use it.  The Pimento and JBCO is a keeper, its wonderful, no problems with it at all. Absolutely loved it.  No side effects at all, none.</li>
    <li> Although I did not purchase my JBCO from Amazon.com (got mines from a local beauty supply store) I FREAKING LOVE THIS OIL!!!! I first heard about this product cruising YouTube while watching hair regimen vids by Shorty2Sweet (she&#x27;s amazing and her regimen is AWESOME) and decided to give it a try. After watching her vids I decided to stretch the time in between my relaxers just like she does to see a noticable change in length. The last relaxer I gave myself was 5/18/13 and within that week I purchased the JBCO. I have been using this oil for 31 days and I am floored at the results!!!!!!! When I first used it, my scalp was tingling and I got a little nervous thinking my hair may fall out (silly me lol) but it was actually the oil seeping in my follicles and starting it&#x27;s magic :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Since I have been using this, my new growth has came in MUCH faster than normal (I have about a good 2.5\\&quot; of new growth!!) and my hair is noticeably thicker and stronger!!!!! I use to have a small bald spot on my right temple (from relaxing and applying color the same day) and it would NOT grow back in. Since JBCO has been in life, the spot is no longer there!!! The smell of this product is not overwhelming like others may say (to be honest, I barely smell it once it&#x27;s applied)and the consistency of it is rather thick but I like that. Long story short, if your looking for a great product that aids in quick hair growth and helps maintain your length, LOOK NO FURTHER!!!! IT&#x27;S JBCO :)</li>
    <li> A..MA..ZINGGG!! 5 star all the way, hands down...i definitely recommend it...</li>
    <li> I received my bottle four days after I ordered it (May 28th) and have been using it ever since. Just like the other reviewers said, the oil is pretty thick but the smell wasnt as bad as I thought it was going to be. I put the oil in a bottle like the ones that are used to apply dye and I put it on all of my edges. I have a weave and was putting it in between my braids but it was making my weave hair really oily so I decided to add it to a spray bottle and added water to it and I spray that in between my braids. I have already noticed hair growth and I am pretty excited about it. I use the oil pretty much every day in combination with taking 10,000 mcg&#x27;s of Biotin. I will post a review 6 months from the date I received the product to update my progress. I am pretty excited about my hair growth so far and I am about to purchase another bottle and the shampoo and conditioner from Tropic Isle Living as well.</li>
    <li> i like this product, but now i have to wait to see if it works. hope it does. thank you.</li>
    <li> My wife loves what this does for her hair, which she says is conditions it and makes it strong. Worth a try from what I hear!</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I love it, when I run out of it, I will absolutely order more.  I did not realize that this castor oil was healing oil, when I&#x27;m having pain in my leg, I rub it on and the pain is gone,</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. I didn&#x27;t realize the smell was so strong, so next time I will order the lavender scented one.</li>
    <li> Jamacian black castor oil is a staple of mines. I usebit in my hair. Its has a slight odor but it doesnt bother me. I use it to thicken and grow my hair out. It makes my natural hair so soft.</li>
    <li> love it for my hair !</li>
    <li> At first you hear people saying how this makes your hair grow. I tried it on my granddaughter and not even using it faithfully, her hair is growing. Now my whole family is using it. It is a new staple in our hair care regiment!! Thanks</li>
    <li> Might help with skin cancer as a mixture, with minced garlic, or as a mixture 1:1 with baking soda, for more aggressive treatment of early stages of skin cancer. The list of Castor Oil use is to long.</li>
    <li> This is a great oil for natural hair. However, the yellowish castor oil is great as well. This is starting to become to expensive because it is in high demand...so I&#x27;m going to purchase regular castor oil for the grocery story. Works just as well</li>
    <li> I mix this castor oil with unrefined organic coconut oil. It keeps hair shiny, without being oily. I recommend this for &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair wearers.</li>
    <li> Received quickly and used it right away.  My hair seems to have filled in a bit.  Although it does have a weird smell and somewhat thick.  But I believe it is working.</li>
    <li> Has a mild smell of ashes</li>
    <li> Seeing little growth. Really thick oil. It&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY GRAND BAY HAIR TO GROW AND WHEN I SAY GREW HE HAIR IS BEAUTIFUL</li>
    <li> Great for thinning hair and bald spots.</li>
    <li> Its good, but its a little amount for that much money.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been using to long but I do believe this is working!</li>
    <li> I have seen some results in growth in the areas where I apply the JBCO. The oil is very thick so please know a little goes a long way. The scent is interesting. Not stinky, but more of a woodsy smell.</li>
    <li> So far I like this product.  I am noticing some new hair growth, especially around the hairline.  I am going to continue to use it because I believe it is working.  I also like to use it for my eyebrows, there is a noticeable difference in the thickness of my eyebrows.  I was having trouble regrowing them after many years of plucking.</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil for a while now and I live it. It has a funny smell but its tolerable. Ouse it on my hair and its wonderful.  It only takes a small amount.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for 10 months, and I love it!  I use it to soothe my scalp from itching, I use it in my conditioners, I use it to seal my ends when I do a twist out.  My hair love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Its worked great on my hair growth</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this. It really work in so many ways. I had thin eye lashes now after 1 month you can see a huge difference.</li>
    <li> This product is okay. However, it is very heavy, and leaves the hair sticky and greasy when applied to the scalp. I will try and continue to use it when I can.</li>
    <li> I love the price and the quality of this item it worked GREAT!  I would purchase it again from Amazon! The 4 oz only negative aspect of this item.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet but it is thick and makes my hair very shiny. It can also smooth down edges too because its so thick. good product.</li>
    <li> Did like this stuff at all. I gave it away.</li>
    <li> Hopefully i see results</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t had it long enough to give a good review</li>
    <li> Very please with my order, it came on time and now I am jst hoping it help for my hair growth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an African American woman w/short naturally curly hair &amp; I purchased this for some thinning areas I had on my scalp. I used it only on wash day during my deep condish (because it makes my scalp itch A LOT) &amp; I only put it on the problem areas, then I would wash it out &amp; style. It worked ok (I saw a little improvement/growth) but like anything it took regular use to see the small results that I&#x27;d noticed. A little goes a long way, it&#x27;s fairly thick/heavy &amp; the smell isn&#x27;t that bad too me, it resembles the smell of paper in my opinion. I&#x27;m now starting to use it for my Kimmaytube Leave-In Condish to see what moisturizing results I get from it on my hair instead...I&#x27;ll see how that goes...</li>
    <li> Not a product that brings your hair back in as some people seem to think.</li>
    <li> I found out about this item from a coworker. Years of damage to my hair has taken a tole on my hair line and edges, my edges have been bald for nearly 45 years and I was ready to try something that would help. I have to give this item a 5 would like to give it more but thats the highest I can give. I started using Tropic Isle Jamaican Castor oil October 24, 2014, I wouldn&#x27;t check my progress everyday because I didn&#x27;t want to be disappointed and I knew with my edges being gone for so many years it would take at least 3 months to see any results, but as I passed the mirror just now I was amazed to see NEW hair growth after only 1 month,I am so satisfied,never would I have thought a product like this would give me my hair back. I purchased 2 bottles on my original order on just my coworkers testimonial,but since then I have purchased 3 more and yes I will get more, they are much cheaper online than at the beauty outlet in my area,so Im getting twice as much for the cost. This product is amazing</li>
    <li> Excellent! I love JBCO. I have been used it for a year. My hair grow faster than normal when I use JBCO the other days. 1/4 inche to 1/2 inche each month if I use it for 3 months my hair grow about 2 inches, but I do not wash with shampoo, or any products except JBCO, coconut oil and sometimes conditions. Also I do use home remedies with egg, avocado, banana, essential oil and sour cream. That is how my hair work growth than ever...</li>
    <li> Yes, it was what I was looking for and needed.  I make my own hair oils so it was perefect.</li>
    <li> my only complaint was that it is a little too thick for me!</li>
    <li> Product arrived a day early. I purchased it to create a hair, scalp and body oil. I&#x27;m waiting for other oils to arrive so I haven&#x27;t used it yet. Based on the reviews I&#x27;ve read, I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this Product!!!</li>
    <li> Love...love it. I buy it all the time and my hair is stronger and longer</li>
    <li> My natural curls love this product.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews on Amazon.com, but I decided to write one after trying this product for myself. One person&#x27;s review on here - whose hair type bore striking similarities to mine - made me all the more interested into buying Jamaican Black Castor Oil and so I did.    It&#x27;s only been a week and already my hair around the edges grew in pretty quickly. Seeing instant results has not only made me smile, but has made me less self-conscious and more confident (esp. when I&#x27;m out in public).     I don&#x27;t plan on hiding behind some bandana, hat or scarf for the rest of my life. I used to hate having to bobby pin and clip my hair daily, just so that it would stay in place.     I&#x27;m glad that I&#x27;ve finally found something that has stimulated my hair growth from root to end, including the edges (after searching for a remedy which felt like forever). Thank God for this stuff.</li>
    <li> Well the reviews are true about this product being very thick, but the smell really doesn&#x27;t bother me it is not as strong as I thought it was going to be according to some reviews.  So far I have been using this product for two weeks now and I haven&#x27;t notice any difference on my hair line or hair thickness, but miracles don&#x27;t happen over night so I guess I have to be persistant to see any change.  I will update my review if I ever do notice a difference on my hairline.</li>
    <li> great product but it is now available in local stores</li>
    <li> Love it.  Very good oil. It has my scalp looking very healthy. I will definitely buy more.  Best product yet, that I have been&lt;br /&gt;satisfied with for my hair.</li>
    <li> The best there is. I noticed new growth within a week. My hair is also getting stronger, I have thyroid issues and my hair was falling out. I can&#x27;t say enough about this product.</li>
    <li> castor oil is a staple in my hair routine</li>
    <li> Just started using this product, I&#x27;m praying I get the results I&#x27;m looking for! Will post results later!</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD. I USE IT ON MY HAIR.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for balding hair</li>
    <li> This totally works. I&#x27;ve noticed a rapid growth in my hair once I started using the oil. I love it.</li>
    <li> very moisturizing and effective. love this oil</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this. It has a very nutty smell to it and that attracts me for some reason. But I have tried this on my face, body and hair. It&#x27;s far too thick for all three and I can only get it to work with aloe vera underneath on my hair. Otherwise it&#x27;s too sticky and I can&#x27;t wash it all out.</li>
    <li> Great product but the scent is a little pungent.Thank you.</li>
    <li> people make some phenomenal claims about this stuff.  it has not grown my hair that I can see, but I haven&#x27;t used it very long.  initially, I couldn&#x27;t take the ultra thick, gooey texture. but recently I started using it, because my scalp is always so dry.  I&#x27;ve had braids for a long time. they give black girls the freedom to wash and run.  admittedly, I didn&#x27;t condition or moisturize properly. my braids were small and threatening to lock and I decided to clean them up and make only 6 or 7 large braids. they seem so tame when they&#x27;re braided but take one out...and it&#x27;s a lion&#x27;s mane...lol&lt;br /&gt;anyway, I used this stuff directly on my itchy scalp and after massaging it in, the itch stopped.  I even slid this oil down the entire length of my 12-14 inch braids. I tied them up in polyester thinking that the gunk would come thru cotton. my hair drank this oil up. the next day I removed the scarf and was shocked to find my nappy roots were under arrest, bone straight and felt like silk.  my braids are still strong and wild when I take them out, but taking them out is a breeze. fighting to take them out was why I didn&#x27;t give them more care.  I don&#x27;t mind taking them out now. I still hate the way it feels on my hands, but my hair loves this stuff. straight out of the bottle, it does smell like meds. and the company should provide a cap that tightens w/o fully spinning. I&#x27;m not completely turned off, since I can tighten the cap. I just can&#x27;t go too far. I don&#x27;t know if it will affect your hair this way, but mine loves it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now on my two year old daughter hair and I like how its growing her hair and it also makes her hair very soft. The smell is not bad either!</li>
    <li> My friend and I got bitten by bed bugs, and we applied this oil to the swollen skin. It worked amazingly!! But I don&#x27;t think it helps with my hair. I find no new hair growing. I am taking biotin pills to see how it may work.</li>
    <li> Nice and thick great cost for your money.</li>
    <li> This product is great for gaining moisture and it really help with growth and thickness. Everyone should use this product</li>
    <li> Awesome Product... my new growth is the truth!!!&lt;br /&gt;only been using it where i was thinning.&lt;br /&gt;After only using this oil for a week, my hair grew like crazy!!!</li>
    <li> Just received my Jamaican Castor Oil and can&#x27;t wait to try. I also purchased the shampoo, conditioner, leave-in conditioner and growth treatment. It was pricey but I figured if I purchased one might as well get the whole package which it does have a nice smell to it. I&#x27;ve cut my hair off about a month ago to start my natural look, thank God my hairs not course. I was using the Doo Growth products which grew my hair also. I was bald on the left side from years of wearing weave, mind you my hair is thin and fine so using glue was not a great idea and I must say my hair has grown back in a matter of two-three weeks. I heard about this product on YouTube and thought to try it. I just want to point out one thing about the castor oil, I&#x27;ve read several reviews concerning the smell, maybe it&#x27;s me but it smells like pure oil to me at least the bottle I&#x27;ve received. I&#x27;ll write an update on the results. I know that just because a product worked for some people doesn&#x27;t mean it will work for all but it&#x27;s worth a try. If I receive good results, I&#x27;ll purchase more in the future. I&#x27;ll give it a month</li>
    <li> great on my curly kids hair, kept it from drying out. also used on permed hair still not too heavy</li>
    <li> Best product out there for hair growth, you wanna see length? I suggest you try out Jamaica in a bottle.</li>
    <li> Man I have to say JBCO Is that stuff! It makes my hair so soft and it helped with my edges to grow in more thicker. Anyone contemplating on buying this stuff should really invest in it. The only down side is the smell but the pros really out way that one con.</li>
    <li> Used with a mix of olive oil for about two weeks...my edges were noticeably thinner. I have been natural for 17 weeks. Immediately discontinued.</li>
    <li> I love Jamaican black castor oil ever since I learned about this on hairlista I&#x27;ve been using it ever since it grows my hair in nice and thick I will&lt;br /&gt;Continue to use this product I love this!</li>
    <li> this product meets beyond my expectations. I have been useing this as well as my daughters&lt;br /&gt;after about 2weeks of useing it, I start noticing new growth! it has even stoped the breakage in our hair. I highly recommend this to anyone who needs to grow their hair! !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently wearing a protective style (braids).  I use the black castor oil on my scalp once a week to prevent dryness.  So far it&#x27;s working fine.</li>
    <li> No after smell and just need to use a small amount also keeps hair healthy!</li>
    <li> Thank you for the quick delivery and happy with the product. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Doesn&#x27;t smell good at all, but it works wonders.  I use this product on my eyebrows, along with my hair. It is so good that I ordered 2 extra bottles for my mom and friend. This is a great oil to have for natural hair.</li>
    <li> Delivery was quick and i have been using this product for a couple years now and it works great on my hair.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t help my hair grow nor did it make my hair more manageable. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Tis product is great for thickening up your hair and growing it out quicker. I love this product! Holy grail for sure :)</li>
    <li> I did not see a result yet , am still using it , but I do not like the smell and viscous , i mean it is so heavy and sticky on my hair ..</li>
    <li> This product is very good and authentic. There&#x27;s no regrets on my side and I intend to buy from this vender again!</li>
    <li> After doing research and reading many reviews I decided purchased the JBCO to help regrow my thinning edges.  After using it twice a day for almost 5 weeks I have seen little to no regrowth. The plus for me is that it helped with my dry scalp.</li>
    <li> I did&#x27;nt like this product at all. It didnt agree with my hair, i quit using this product and threw it away.</li>
    <li> A friend told me about this product.  I read the reviews and decided to try.  The smell is smoky but not that bad.  My locs look healthy and my trouble spots look like they are coming to life.  Its still too soon for me to give a good comment on hair growth though.</li>
    <li> Over priced and doesn&#x27;t compare with other products like it!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Results are good on hair growth. More comments in a few weeks as my hair continues to grow and get healthy.</li>
    <li> Never a problem. Delivered quickly. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I put it in an applicator bottle and mixed it wit peppermint oil so I don&#x27;t have to stand the smell and it&#x27;s doing my hair wonders.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product for sealing in moisture.. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for a hot oil treatment unless you cut it with another oil like coconut or olive... Otherwise it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> JBCO is an awesome product. My hair started thinning around the hairline and nape. I&#x27;ve been using the product off and on for the past 8 months. (i only used it for about 2momths straight then got lazy) but my hair is coming back. My hair line is almost back to its normal stage. I would reccomend this product because it works, and the service was decent.</li>
    <li> I bought this to go with my homemade hair oils that I mix for myself. So far so good. The entire purchase transaction and shipping was great. Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I love this product because it helped a lot in many ways. It has thickened my hair, gave it a great shine, grew it and locks in moisture. I place it on my scalp every other day and have been using this for over a year now. It does have a smokey scent but I don&#x27;t mind it at all. I would highly recommend trying this out before going back to the old school grease!</li>
    <li> This helps my natural hair feel soft and manageable. This is a must have when it comes to my hair regimen.</li>
    <li> I added some argan oil and coconut oil with this product and used for about 1 week with amazing difference in the texture of my hair,not sure if it will help it to grow,I guess I will need some more time to determine that.&lt;br /&gt;I can tell that my hair is getting healthier,not falling out as before,not flaky in the scalp,easier to manage,just in a few days!</li>
    <li> It is all in the name, but not what I expected.</li>
    <li> The consistency of this oil is amazing i Love the thickness of it, but i am ordering like perfume oils to add to this so it mask the after smell, which is not very strong but i enjoy really nice smelling things so i am not worried. I use this on my hair I love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> Loving the Jamican Black Castor Oil  Don&#x27;t know how I didn&#x27;t know about the Jamaican Black Castor Oil before this.  My hair has the softness and shine now!!!</li>
    <li> I am transitioning and this is really good with helping manage new growth.  It does have and ashtray smell but it&#x27;s not unbearable.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Great product. As described</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. It smells a little bit but when mix with shea butter...much better! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I tryed many products to prevent hair-loss, that in my case is caused by things like stress, diet and hard training.&lt;br /&gt;And Jamaican black castor oil is the best treatment i found so far! together with \\&quot;Alter Ego Garlic treatment\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Actually i mix these two together 50/50, and after hairwash i masage the mix into my scalp, and then rinse well after 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;i do this 3 times a week, and this is making wonders on me! My hair grows fuller and it has stopped my hairloss completely!&lt;br /&gt;I resently stopped using the \\&quot;eqyss mega-tek rebuilder\\&quot; that i used to do every time before this oil-garlic regimen,&lt;br /&gt;its to many products to handle, and i think im not so interested to grow hair fast as i am to grow it thick!</li>
    <li> The reason I love this product is because it works! It is a bit thick, and you should use it sparingly. I bought this to thicken up my edges and I can see the difference after a month. So, the good news, even a small jar will last you a while and you will see the difference in a short period of time. The bad news: it does had a woody, earthy smell. Thus, using it sparingly is a good idea for more reason than one. However, the smell does dissipate; so I would recommend using it at night but just before going out. If you are like me and am trying to give your hair a rest from heat and other harsh chemicals, and want to boost the rejuvenation process, try this oil! I bought a small jar (4 oz) and now that I see it is for me, I bought the 8 oz jar.</li>
    <li> I ordered this oil after seeing reviews on Youtube. Most African-American women were using it for thinning areas and edges. It&#x27;s thick and rich, but it has a strong smell that dissipates once applied to the hair and/or scalp. I use it on my edges to keep them moisturized. So far I&#x27;m liking my results and I&#x27;m going to keep using it (about 3 to 4 times a week before styling). Each person has to see how often to apply it and how much to use for themselves.</li>
    <li> I started using this product on my hair, which is fine and natural (3c/4a). My hair was weak and brittle from overdoing the extensions. I saw results immediately after using the  Jamaican Black Castor Oil. After one application, my hair was noticeable thicker and softer. Now a few months later, my hair has grown tremendously; I have noticeably less split ends, more moisture, and fuller, healthier hair overall. The JBCO also allows my hair to achieve fuller, less frizzy twist-outs and wash-n-gos. My hairstylist asked what I had been doing to my hair to achieve these results and now she recommends this product to her other clients. I love this product and I am about to order another batch.</li>
    <li> Does what its supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved JBCO and this one is no exception</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading online forums that castor oil can help with hair growth. The castor oil has a thin consistency so I usually add another oil to it like coconut oil. It leaves my hair very moisturized and soft. I had some thinning and dry ends and after using this both issues are getting better. Some people complain about the smell but I wasn&#x27;t bothered by the smell at all. Great product</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous!  Yes I use it on my hair, yes it grows your lashes, yes I use it to moisturize my face at night.  Im 56 and can honestly say I look fabulous.  Its magic in a bottle.  I will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> I found the Jamaican Black Castor Oil to cause a lot of itching!!!!  I definitely won&#x27;t be using it often.  It&#x27;s great to use after a wash to seal the hair, but that&#x27;s it!!  I find the regular castor oil, cold compressed, to be better and does not cause the itching that I experienced with this product.</li>
    <li> That is all. I believe it is making my edges come back in...slowly but surely. Will be ordering more shortly.</li>
    <li> This product is great it does not take a lot of it to work in hair.  I will say this stuff work miracles for my edges.</li>
