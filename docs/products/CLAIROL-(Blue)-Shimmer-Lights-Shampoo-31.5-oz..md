      <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Best of luck, I don&#x27;t think everyone has the same hair, so one product may work for some, and others not.</li>

      <li>I love the shampoo and have no complaints, but despise the bottle.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i love this stuff</li>

      <li>Using this product has made my hair color &amp;#34;pop.&amp;#34; I love my &amp;#34;getting older&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>After I did this, I used my kerastase conditioner and then proceeded to use my kerastase bain rich chrome mask (which smells amazing and conditions like magic).</li>
      <li>I purchased this product and was very excited, because I could have it in 1 day.</li>
      <li>This is the best product for those of us who have grey hair.</li>

      <li>Cost competitive, good quality and large volumn containers so fewer orders.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is lightening my hair, I started noticing a difference after about 5 uses.  It is, however, very drying.</li>
    <li> Cost competitive, good quality and large volumn containers so fewer orders. Stays in the shower; no problems.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years! I have bleach blonde hair and this helps to keep it that beautiful platnium color.&lt;br /&gt;I usually go to my Sally Beauty Supply store and buy it for 17.95, but they were out and told me they wouldn&#x27;t have it for a couple of weeks, so I turned to Amazon. I purchased this product and was very excited, because I could have it in 1 day. When I recieved this in the mail it was EVERYWHERE! It leaked through the box onto my porch and stained my porch! I returned this product and will not be ordering it from here ever again!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for blonde hair.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work at all for me</li>
    <li> This product works if you are willing to sacrifice the health of your hair. After one use, my hair was barely brushable and strands were shriveled. My hair is slightly on the dry side to begin with so I would not recommend this product unless you have very healthy locks to start. I even gave it a second chance since it did neutralize some brassy tones. I mixed a small amount with my regular shampoo in hopes to minimize damage, unsuccessfully. I have thrown it away and had to spend a large amount of money on expensive reconstructing products to counteract the result of using this product.</li>
    <li> I wish a stylist had recommended this 40 years ago!  Solves my color fading issue completely!  Weeks longer between dyes.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for gray hair. It is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that helps remove yellowing. My hair is long and almost completely silver. I get comments from people I know and even from strangers what a great color it is. Before shimmer lights it was yellow and icky.     It works better than the product they gave (sold) me at the salon that they swore would work (it didn&#x27;t). I used to find it everywhere in by local area but can&#x27;t find it now so buying it through amazon. Thank goodness for the internet.</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended that I try this shampoo, and while it is very drying, it works wonders! Just make sure to use deep conditioning after you shampoo with this, as it does dry out your strands.</li>
    <li> so, if you can remember the rest of this line, you&#x27;re probably ready for Shimmer Lights.  I used to use this to get rid of the brassy yellow from too much fun in the sun.  Now, in later years, I&#x27;m using it to blend the yellow and the gray (almost white in some areas)to come up with a unique blonde version of \\&quot;salt and pepper.\\&quot;  Even my hairdresser doesn&#x27;t ask me about how I want to color my hair - dyes, bleaches, highlights, lowlights, etc.  In fact she took a picture of my hair (no face, just the hair) for her album.  You&#x27;d think she did the coloring - or maybe she&#x27;s going to try to take credit.  But it all belongs to Shimmer Lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it every day because I&#x27;m in a humid environment, but sparingly, and always follow with a little conditioner.  If you overdue the amount, or the time, yes, you may end up with dry, purple (it&#x27;s definitely purple out of the bottle!) hair, but try a little less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Also, from Amazon (which is definitely favorably priced!), I would order this by itself, or only with other non-perishable item.  The last time I received a bottle, it was not wrapped and had leaked all over the other items in the box.  Amazon customer service took care of everything, but it was EXTREMELY messy, and I&#x27;ll be following my own advice on future orders of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, if you&#x27;re still reading this and on the fence....I&#x27;d strongly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m getting a little gray(grey?) around the temples which is why I bought this product but the whole family uses it because it smells so good!</li>
    <li> Works as good as the expensive salon brands.</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly and works to take a tad of the brassiness from your hair either blonde or brunette. Large bottle will last a long time-</li>
    <li> Great for white/gray hair.  Leaves no yellow!  Leaves hair soft, shiny and manageable.  Large pump bottle is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Keeps your blonde, blonde!</li>
    <li> bottle was leaking when I recieved it, all over box pump was broken. I am sure its a good shampoo</li>
    <li> My problem was brassiness from 30vol bleach for highlights that doesn&#x27;t take blonde light enough (brassy yellow instead of lemon yellow that 40vol gives, but also has a greater risk for breaking fine hair). So, I tried a purple shampoo &amp; conditioner, which didn&#x27;t do much, if anything, to remove the brassiness. On searches turned up a suggestion to try purple food coloring to get rid of brassiness.  After a week or so of daily adding that to my purple conditioner (thinking I was &amp;#34;enhancing&amp;#34; its effectiveness), I finally realized my low lights had turned red, so I was worse than where I began. But, I&#x27;m not surprised since purple is, after all, made by combining blue and red. What to do? I needed a blue shampoo (short of professional toners).  All &amp;#34;silver&amp;#34; shampoos, it turned out, were purple, except this one from Clairol.  I followed a reviewer&#x27;s instructions and shampooed once, rinsed, then shampooed a 2nd time, towel dried the hair to remove most of the excess water, and put a shower cap over the 2nd shampooing, followed by a towel wrap to catch water drips. Left that on for 45 minutes, checked the progress (looking good and not red!), so rinsed well and styled it. WOW, it took out ALL the red and left my highlights a little darker, but still visible, AND my hair very conditioned, shiny and unusually manageable - very hard to achieve in my dry climate. While one has to watch the process and not let it get too ashy, it worked wonderfully.  Just watch it, especially your ends (and even more carefully with bleached ends), and stop when it appears to be enough.  Someone wrote that twice a week is perfect, so I&#x27;ll try that.  I used it the next day as a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; shampoo in the shower and after drying it, the hair appeared to be a bit greyer, so I knew daily use might be too much.  Conclusion: for getting rid of brassiness, or unwanted red tones, this is my new go-to!  Stay away from purple products unless you want reddish tones.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend any other purple shampoo to maintain the perfect blonde color.</li>
    <li> I have naturally silver gray hair and this product turned it a different color gray.  If someone has dull gray hair then it will probably add highlights. It did add body to my hair.  The purple shampoo did stain the bathtub and required some scrubbing.  Recommend wiping up the spill immediately.</li>
    <li> Smells like my grandma&#x27;s perfume. And it&#x27;s hard to get rid of this smell! Awful!!!&lt;br /&gt;Though treats your hair well....</li>
    <li> Great product but both bottles leaked was quite a mess. Next time tape the lids. Both lids were loose and leaking.</li>
    <li> great product takes the yellow tinge that builds over time out of pure white hair....</li>
    <li> Works great. I&#x27;ll continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo before and it worked fine but this time it did not seem to do as good a job.  Not sure why but would not purchase again. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Shimmer lights is sucha a mainstay in my shampoo rotation. Leaves my blonde a little brighter and less brassy.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product to all that have gray hair. It&#x27;s not just for blond hair. It not only smells wonderful, it took the yellow out of my gray&#x27;s. I was thinking of coloring my hair, but now I love it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is not blue it is purple. When it arrived not only was I disappointed with the fact that it was not the blue shampoo I thought it would be but the bottle was busted and was leaking out of the box. Needless to say I was extremely disappointed</li>
    <li> Use it everyday. Follow the instructions, and within 2 weeks the yellow is gone. My hair now has a silvery glow</li>
    <li> Product is ok. However packaging wise, it arrived leaking.  The top wasn&#x27;t placed on right and it spilled, the pump didn&#x27;t work either. Luckily I hasn&#x27;t thrown out the previous pump.</li>
    <li> Does the job, but this stuff smells so bad. Geez. It doesn&#x27;t go away either, my hair reeks after using it and it gives me a headache. The things we do to be blonde...</li>
    <li> This shampoo keeps my white hair white (rather than having a yellow-ish cast).  It&#x27;s heavy, so I watch for offers of free shipping.</li>
    <li> Product came with a broken pump</li>
    <li> This was such a great investment in my Blonde locks! Not only did it keep the brassy yellow/orange out of my hair but it didn&#x27;t dry it out like many other &amp;#34;Purple&amp;#34; Shampoos that I have tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definetely recommend this product to anyone with Blonde hair!</li>
    <li> It makes my white hair glisten not to mention it is a great shampoo.  Clariol does it again.  Try it.</li>
    <li> It took a few shampoos to get it right.My pure white hair has turned a ghastly yellow from the iron in our water in spite of a water treatment system.  Instructions say to leave on for 3-5 mins. I left it on while I showered then rinsed it off.  It left my white hair lavender and the yellow part that I wanted to eliminate turned greenish.  Now I&#x60;ve learned to shampoo and rinse immediately. It doesn&#x60;t remove the yellow, just makes it less harsh.  I&#x60;ve switched to distilled water until the yellow is grown out and cut off but probably will continue with the shampoo if it doesn&#x60;t turn me into a BLUE HAIR.</li>
    <li> This is an okay product.  I bought it as my hair is turning silver.  However, it tends to cause my scalp to itch and I cannot use this 2 days in a row.  It is heavily perfumed.</li>
    <li> Product arrived before due date, its such an excellent product for gray hair. And the price its better than any other beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> I use this 2-3 times a week to help tone down and ash up the yellow cast in my (lightened) hair. It does a great job. One of those days, I put it on dry or damp hair and leave it on for 30-40 minutes before lathering and rinsing out. Because of this, I no longer have to use an actual toner process with developer, which only lasts around a week. So far, I&#x27;ve had no issues with my hair actually becoming lavender, something that did happen with another brand.</li>
    <li> as advised for grey hairs</li>
    <li> I looooveeeee this shampoo it is the best thing for blondes. My hair was crazy brassy but after using this shampoo my hair looks amazing. Also  I don&#x27;t think any other shampoo out there smells better than this one. It smells incredible and it lasts so long even on the third day I could.still smell it in my hair. I love it!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is excellent for very blond hair turning white. One should consider a very good conditioner, though. The shampoo seems to dry out naturally dry and fine hair.  P.S. Have not tried the shimmer light conditioner,</li>
    <li> I have been bleaching my hair for years and this stuff is the real deal.  It is super saturated so I mix it with regular shampoo and only leave it on a couple of minutes.  I get compliments and questions about how I keep my hair so white constantly.  I also get the occasional &amp;#34;Khaleesi!&amp;#34; shouted at me!</li>
    <li> I chose to stop coloring my hair about 6 months ago. I am now silver-gray with interesting natural highlights coming through here and there. Using this product has made my hair color &amp;#34;pop.&amp;#34; I love my &amp;#34;getting older&amp;#34; hair now. It shines and sparkles. Great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I had bought this in a salon, used it, and somehow.it moved its way to the back of the shelf and didn&#x27;t really notice a difference until I picked it back up and started using it again. My hair seems in better shape, not as dry and handles alot better. I had moved, wasn&#x27;t sure where I would find more and was tickled pink to find on Amazon. I should have known that Amazon would come through for me!!</li>
    <li> I have 7AA hair and I recently came up from about a 2N. I have always had issues keeping that &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; out of my hair. With this product, you can. This one actually works and Ive tried aveda&#x27;s blue malva and Nexxus platinum pro and they both barely did a thing. If you&#x27;re in need of major toning down, this is going to save you. My hair was literally orange and yellow. I washed once, rinsed  then lathered and put a cap on for.. a while. I wanna say a half hour to an hour. then i rinsed my hair thoroughly (as if it were a color) and put on a hair mask with a cap under heat for 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I dried my hair and it looked like someone just did my hair!!&lt;br /&gt;For weekly maintenance, i use it once or twice a week and follow up leaving my conditioner in for longer or conditioning twice because this shampoo is kinda drying.&lt;br /&gt;i love this stuff I&#x27;m never gonna use anything else!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo several times to help with the brassiness after getting my hair lightened and honestly it hasn&#x27;t done anything to fix the problem. To make make matters worse, the scent is horrible. I&#x27;ve heard others using their conditioner to mask the smell but the shampoo is so strong that the scent sticks to your hair. The smell kind of reminds me of cheap dog shampoo. For reference, I am a brunette and have a warm ombre/balayage over my dark brown base - maybe this shampoo only works if your hair is blonde.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and covers the gray,</li>
    <li> I have used more expensive &amp;#34;blue/ purple&amp;#34; shampoos in the past to get rid of the brassy color in my blonde hair.  Because of the reviews I decided to try this cheaper brand.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to work quite as well as the more expensive brand but the biggest turn off to me was the smell.  It reminds me of a dog shampoo (and not the nice fragrant ones).  I use it less than I would if it would have a better smell to it.</li>
    <li> I am living in the Caribbean where intense sun, sea water and high mineral content in the well water used for showering makes my white hair very yellow. This shampoo takes the yellow out and brings my hair back to it&#x27;s natural white. Don&#x27;t leave in too long or it will tint your hair purple.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is an absolute necessity for white hair. I highly recommend this product. I took one star off because the packaging was bad and allowed much of the product to leak out.</li>
    <li> Ended up giving it away.  I don&#x27;t have blonde hair anymore!</li>
    <li> During my last trim I asked my hairstylist what does sun do to dyed hair and she said it would turn it more red/orange and brassy looking. I have Brown hair, turning gray and use either a Medium ash or dark ash brown hair color. This shampoo has been a great addition to my hair products. It has helped to keep the red/orange brassy hair tones out of my hair color and cost less than some of the other products like Aveda&#x27;s or J Beverley Hills Blonde shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product if you have colored hair and you want to keep the red/orange or brassy tones that come from color fading and being out in the sun.</li>
    <li> Their was a major problem of the shipment... Awful</li>
    <li> The top was not screwed properly.  The wrapping around the bottle was not sufficient to hold the leak.  Lost over an once or more.&lt;br /&gt;I love this shampoo, but someone has to close tight the lids!!!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. My hairdresser recommended it when I went platinum. Super purple pigmented. I would recommend it to any blonde. I have only seen this size on Amazon and it is perfect with the pump because the purple can get messy. Be careful using it in a white shower and be sure to rinse any shower curtains or tiles off because if left to sit the shampoo can leave your tub with a couple of purple tinted spots for awhile.</li>
    <li> My husband has gray/white hair and this is the only shampoo that keeps his hair a great color.  Without this shampoo his hair gets a yellowish tinge and this is the only kind of shampoo that works well.  Will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m blessed with beautiful hair -- very thick -- and used to be really red.  For years, the red color has been fading to the point that people even consider me to have strawberry blond hair.  Well, I went to a new hairdresser about 4 months ago.  He thought I had my hair colored because the color is very pretty.  When I told him my hair color was God-given, he advised me to try the Clairol shimmer lights shampoo, because it would brighten the faded color.  I can&#x27;t tell you how beautiful my hair is now -- all the natural brassiness is gone -- the red tones are beautiful with the streaks of blonde (only I know it is really gray hair).  People constantly ask me who does my hair color.  Thank  you, Clairol.</li>
    <li> I have really hard water in my house and my blonde highlights always turn yellow very quickly! I happen to like more of the whiter blonde highlights and after a few minutes with this shampoo, my yellow highlights look completely refreshed again!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> Wonderful for gray hair.  Good to remove the brassiness from blonde.  Have been using for years and keep coming back every time  after trying something different.</li>
    <li> For people who KNOW what toning shampoo is - this is what you want! HUGE bottle that lasts a few months and works everytime to keep your color from fading or getting brassy.</li>
    <li> I use this product 2-3 times each week to keep the yellow out of my beautiful white hair, and it works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;People often comment on the lovely color and sheen of my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! Use it only twice a week! It lighens and brightens hair! Thus was a great price also!</li>
    <li> The shampoo has a very strong scent and I didn&#x27;t really notice a big difference in my hair. But, I&#x27;ll still use it a few times a week since I swim and the chlorine dulls my hair and maybe eventually the shampoo will help.</li>
    <li> Works great, my bleached hair is just as vibrant as the day I left the salon. No brassiness at all, even in Florida summer with lots of swimming. My only warning is to get a very good conditioner, this stuff makes your hair feel like straw!</li>
    <li> Have gray hair and it perks it up plus adds body.  I liked it a lot and would order again.</li>
    <li> I love Clairol (Blue) Shimmer Lights Shampoo. My hair always feels clean and has a nice shine, It brings out the silver high lights in my hair.</li>
    <li> Okay as a supplement to full coloring as an in between thing. Won&#x27;t solve the red gold issue on it&#x27;s own, and it is a bit drying so I don&#x27;t use it for every shampoo, and always use with a good conditioner. One hairdresser advised me to apply it to dry hair, leave it on a minute or two before lathering for full effectiveness. Haven&#x27;t tried this yet.</li>
    <li> I have been using Shimmer Lights Shampoo for more than thirty years,  best thing my gray hairs ever found.</li>
    <li> My product came leaking out of the bottle ,an just not at all what I paid for.... Extremly upset.</li>
    <li> The only shampoo that works to get rid of the yellow in grey hair.  I am a huge fan of this product.  People often comment on how nice the color of &amp;#34;my&amp;#34; grey is.  The shine is really nice from this product.  if you are frustrated with yellowing or dull looking grey hair then, this is your product.</li>
    <li> Is there anything better out there for gray or blonde hair that&#x27;s better than this product? I think not! Totally removed any yellow from gray &amp; brassiness from blonde hair while leaving the hair conditioned and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;If you find a better product...please let me now.</li>
    <li> I always use Shimmer Lights shampoo on my hair when I have a light or blonde to tone the brassiness</li>
    <li> I like the product but bottle was poorly wrapped and the purple shampoo was all over when I opened the box and it was halfway gone.</li>
    <li> However, much of this spilled an was a huge mess.  I could not even use the original box to mail it back in.  I still have not received the replacement and it is the only shampoo I use.</li>
    <li> I love the product.  It works on taking the brassy look out of my hair, however the pump on the bottle I received must be defective because it leaks purple/blue on my shower floor after using it.  I would buy again in a heartbeat, but use another bottle.</li>
    <li> A bit messy, be cautious of the &#x27;blue&#x27;, but I do like the results.  Takes the brashness out of graying hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo creates a lovely platinum color for your hair if you are white or semi-gray in hair color.  This is a good bargain with its large pump bottle.</li>
    <li> I use this product religiously</li>
    <li> Perfect for if you are wanting to maintain your silver hair.</li>
    <li> This works tremendously after a relaxer. I always recommend it.</li>
    <li> After a disastrous visit resulting in orange and egg yellow highlights, I was so happy to see the immediate results with this shampoo. It toned down the bad color and make them look nice and blond. I am using it once a week and I like the results.&lt;br /&gt;I also tried John Frieda (my favorite brand for hair products) Sheer Blonde Colour Renew Tone correcting Shampoo , but it didn&#x27;t work as well as Clairol.&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful, don&#x27;t let this shampoo drip on your bath rug or bathrobe because it&#x27;s hard to get the purple out.</li>
    <li> The good thing about this shampoo it does not strip the color from your hair.</li>
    <li> Since 10 years I have let the white show in my hair, I&#x27;ve had received compliments on its silver shine. This shampoo is my secret! It makes the hair so soft and manageable that no conditioner is needed.</li>
    <li> Works perfect, a must have for blond or gray hair. Good shipping time and great price. You can use this product once a week or a 1/3  with your regular shampoo each day.</li>
    <li> A little drying, but works great! It&#x27;s probably dying as its stripping hair on iron and build up! Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Almost 2 years ago I began dying my hair white, but all the chemical toners and dyes could not get it the last step from blonde to white. This shampoo makes my hair look amazing! I have been using it for a year and I love it. When I wash my hair I wash with this shampoo and a regular conditioner and it keeps it from yellowing. Whenever I touch up my roots I don&#x27;t dye them with toners, instead I just keep up my regular washing routine and the roots even out with my hair in about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that on the bottle it says to wash once, then shampoo again and leave in for 2 minutes before rinsing for a stronger effect. I did this once and my hair became lavender. It looked like purple cotton candy and it absolutely did not wash out. I had lavender hair for 2 months until I gave up and re-bleached my whole head. I have never tried that again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a day to day basis for keeping your hair from yellowing this is the answer!</li>
    <li> I have been dying my hair since the wee age of 14 (35 now) - so I have dealt with some brassy moments, fire orange and flaming yellow hair in my experimentation with dye.  I recently was sporting auburn red hair, but had a lot of dark underneath and just wanted to lighten as much of it as I could...I did a highlight job, made the mistake of adding a warm toner and BAM - I had all three problems, orange, yellow and BAH-RASS....so not sexy.  So, not wanting to damage my hair any further, I tried the L&#x27;Oreal Brass Out (not sure if that&#x27;s the exact name) - yeah, left it on for about 45 minutes, my hair was looking like a nice champagne color...washed it out...SHA BAM, no dice, didn&#x27;t do anything.  With a heavy sigh, I went and got an ash color dye, put that over my hair and went online in search of something to help with brassiness.  I read through probably every review on this product, compared it to the reviews of other products and decided to go with this.  After adding the ash dye, it helped to even out my hair, but I had a nice trumpet color sheen...not wanting instrument hair, I washed with the ClAIROL (Blue) Shampoo, rinsed and then per instructions on the bottle, washed again, but left it on for 5 minutes.  I still had warm tones, but mind you, I had red hair originally and I didn&#x27;t use an ash toner, but had tried dying an ash color over, but the brassiness was definitely in check.  It TOTALLY does dry out your hair...I wanted to just use it for a complete week, but knew my hair would be straw, so when my hair gets a little brassy, I just wash with this.  I have bought blonde shampoos and conditioners to use in between and I do leave in conditioners every now and then to help with the dryness it causes.  Be careful with the blonding shampoos and conditioners, some are meant for natural blondes, others for color treated, but some will add tones to your hair and could cause warm colors and brassiness again, thus defeating the purpose.  Next time I highlight, I plan to use an ash toner and something to make sure red stays out as my hair naturally goes to that color and see what happens.  Best of luck, I don&#x27;t think everyone has the same hair, so one product may work for some, and others not.n to use an ash toner and something to make sure red stays out as my hair naturally goes to that color and see what happens.

    <li> I love this stuff. I definitely like the shampoo better than the conditioner (I probably won&#x27;t buy the conditioner again).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highlight my hair, and it unfortunately gets very warm (think yellow, instead of blonde).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This neutralizes it perfectly, and is a must-have for me. I have on occasion left this in too long (several minutes while shaving my legs or something), and have noticed a slight purple tint in my highlights until the next wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of these shampoos and conditioners, including more expensive ones like Aveda&#x27;s Blue Malva, and this is by far my favorite and the most effective.</li>
    <li> Shampoo arrived promptly, but had spilled throughout the plastic bag it was enclosed in and even into the box. lost a significant amount and had a mess to deal with.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is made expressly for people with white hair. It cleans and gets rid of any yellow color in your hair. Super product. Now my barber stocks it, too.</li>
    <li> I had put a demi-permanent color that came out too red.  I washed my hair with this a couple of times and it looks perfect now.  I wish it came in gold too.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair(grey) glow and feels so soft.</li>
    <li> I have used Shimmer lights for years now. I keep my hair somewhere between platinum and white these days and I think this is the best shampoo out there for keeping the brass at bay. Despite what some of the other reviewers said, this shampoo is very conditioning and leaves my hair in better shape than most other shampoos. I DO NOT recommend using the conditioner. That, I admit, is terrible. It will dry your hair and make it totally unmanageable. Since I have the bottle the only time I use it is if I feel my hair is getting extra brassy I&#x27;ll cover it in Shimmer Lights conditioner and allow to sit for 10 minutes. Magic! I normally pair the shampoo with Aveda&#x27;s Blue Mava conditioner and my bleached hair is soft and manageable.  For most people I will warn that you should consider using this shampoo every other day. It can add a purple ting to your hair if it&#x27;s light enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on Amazon is on par with the stores. You might be able to find it for a dollar or two cheaper but in the last 2 years I&#x27;ve noticed the price has gone up.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I have found to get rid of and tone down the brassy tones that blonde hair can get. I use it after swimmming to counteract the chlorine effects and whenever my highlights start to turn a little brassy.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than salon&#x27;s recommended brand and works as well. Would recommend for blonde highlights or greying hair as it keeps out brassy color in blonde or yellowish color in Gray hair</li>
    <li> already see a difference!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t order this in the winter- it will arrive frozen and bursting from a plastic cracked bottle. :o(&lt;br /&gt;I salvaged mine though and I love it. I left it in my hair extra long (10 mn instead of 5) I wanted a slight blue tint. I loved the blue haired old ladies of the 60s and 70s. Now I am old and I want to be one too! I didn&#x27;t want red hues in my hair as I age. I had enough red hues in my  brown natural color! Too many of my friends have the red hues. This blue tint is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo also made my hair smoother and softer, so less breakage when brushing after shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;I will stock up this spring when I know it won&#x27;t arrive frozen.</li>
    <li> Another reviewer took the words right out of my mouth. It smells like Zest soap, which I hate.&lt;br /&gt;When I received the package, I could smell it immediately (before opening it) and wondered if it was simply the box itself.&lt;br /&gt;I found out it wasn&#x27;t. It was the product. I can&#x27;t stand the smell. It reminds me of Zest mixed with lilac. While the smell does fade, I&#x27;d recommend coming in behind it&lt;br /&gt;with one of your own shampoo&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that it does as advertised. Now as I write this, I&#x27;m sitting here right after using it, with a wet head, but it appears to have faded the (already faded) orange and yellows I had&lt;br /&gt;going on in my white hair. I achieved this whiteness via bleaching sessions and would like to keep it that way, but found some faded orange and now light yellows had stubbornly stayed behind.&lt;br /&gt;(I purchased this rather than a toner, as the last one turned my strand test into dark grey. Which is not what I wanted.)&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m glad to see it working after only one go at it.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll see how it works down the road for me.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does everything it says it does. I bleached my hair platinum blonde (almost white) and have been getting some brassy tones that aren&#x27;t appealing at all. I used this shampoo and left it in for about 5-7 min. After I did this, I used my kerastase conditioner and then proceeded to use my kerastase bain rich chrome mask (which smells amazing and conditions like magic). I expected this mask to help take the smell out of my hair, but after leaving the mask on for 10 min and washing out and styling, adding product etc, my hair still smells like my grandmothers dusty old house full of smelly potpourri. It&#x27;s awful. Usually my hair doesn&#x27;t absorb smell from shampoos but I can still smell this smell the next day. Just awful.</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo and have no complaints, but despise the bottle. It leaks like crazy from the dispenser lid. I had to move the product into another pump bottle after cleaning up my counter/tub a half dozen times. Thank heavens it hasn&#x27;t stained my porcelain...just makes a mess.</li>
    <li> I USE THIS PRODUCT EVERY OTHETR SHAMPOOING. IT GIVES MY HAIR MORE OF THE &amp;#34;SILVER&amp;#34;  SHINE THAT I WANT. IT ALSO MAKE MY HAIR FEEL SOFT.</li>
    <li> I get lots of compliments on my gray hair when using this purple shampoo.  Convnient pump bottle.  Nice shine too.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for those of us who have grey hair. Keeps the grey /white true to color without any yellowing or purple tint. Highly recommend and cheaper here than at the saloon.</li>
    <li> This product works very well. I have naturally lighter blonde hair, but it tends to be really golden and I like it brighter. This stuff does an amazing job of brightening my hair and getting rid of that blah blonde that tends to be worse in the wintertime. It looks almost like I&#x27;ve been in the sun. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it tends to make my scalp dry and itchy. The first time I used it about 3-4 times straight untill I got the brightening I wanted and now I just use it 2-3 times a week. I haven&#x27;t really had issues with my hair feeling really dry like some reviews, and it may be because I use a deep conditioner after I use this product. You do not want to use it everyday or it will turn your hair purple.</li>
    <li> Love the product and this is the second time I have ordered, but this time some of the shampoo leaked out into the packaging.</li>
    <li> This was so poorly packaged. The purple shampoo went everywhere - my carpet, my desk and my hands. Returned as most of it is unusable.</li>
    <li> This shampoo....the worst smelling thing I&#x27;ve ever brought into my home. It reminds me of the smell of dog flea-shampoo. Or cheap dandruff shampoo. It did the job of toning my highlights down, but it also took me 3 subsequent shampoos to get the smell out. Absolutely would never buy this stuff again, ever.</li>
    <li> wanted it to make my gray look platinum....it didn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
    <li> I have mostly white hair &amp; this works the best for me without turning my hair yellow.  Have tried several other brands that did turn my hair yellow.  Clairol blue shimmer lights shampoo does not.  Hadn&#x27;t been able to find it locally for quite some time.  Little pricey, but you get a lot &amp; it has a pump.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> The only reason I did not give the shampoo five stars if that it turns my hair a little blue.  My hair stylist suggested I dilute it a little.  I&#x27;ll try that.  It is a really good shampoo for those of us who have earned our gray and want to wear it proudly.</li>
    <li> The bottle was opened and spilled in the plastic and the box when it arrived with about 1/4 gone. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  Have used it for years. Leaves blond, streaked and grey hair silky clean with a bright shine! Absolutely takes the yellow out!</li>
    <li> Been using this for years, first when I dyed my hair blond and later when I stopped and let my natural salt/pepper come through.  Really cools it down and lets the white hairs shine.  My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t find it particularly moisturinzing, so I need a good conditioner afterwards. (Don&#x27;t like the Shimmer Lights Conditioner).  I also found that when I received it from Amazon, the top had become a bit unscrewed and there was shampoo all over the bag it came in and the bottle.  Quite a mess.  Would rebuy however as the Amazon price is so good...</li>
    <li> This made my hair very dry. It did help to tone down my hair a little but not what I expected. I ended up going to the store and bought something else. I only left it in my hair for about two minutes. Also, it did not turn my hair purple. It washes out very easily.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo. It does get the brassiness out. Don&#x27;t use it too often because your hair can become too ashy looking.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo to neutralize the golden tones in my blond hair.  I used it according to the directions, leaving it on for the requisite 5 minutes.  When I rinsed it out, my hair was a gnarled, tangled mess.  I used my regular conditioner, which normally has a lot of &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; to make detangling easy.  However, when I ran a wide toothed comb through my wet hair, the snarls and tangles were so bad that I actually had to pull the comb through, breaking my hair in the process.  When I looked in the mirror, I was shocked to discover that my hair was gray with a purplish cast.  I immediately got back in the shower and used a clarifying shampoo, which didn&#x27;t remove all the gray/purple but it was at least an improvement.  After drying my hair, I was dismayed to find that it was completely dried out and full of static, with none of its normal healthy shine.  This shampoo is simply awful.  I can&#x27;t imagine why anyone would willingly use this stuff twice.  I&#x27;m glad I saved my Sally Beauty Supply receipt because I promptly returned it.  When the sales associate heard my complaints, she recommended another brand, Blond Brilliance.  So I purchased the BB Lathering Toner (i.e. shampoo) and the toning conditioner in the cool tone (there is a warm tone also).  I went home and tried to rid myself of the results of the Shimmer Lights shampoo, which took several uses of a clarifying shampoo. Several days, and many conditioning treatments, later, I used both of the BB products, leaving each of them on for the minimum time.  I was happy to discover that the BB shampoo felt completely different than the Shimmer Lights.  I could tell it would leave my hair in good condition.  It contains no sulfates so it&#x27;s very gentle.  The BB conditioner felt very slippery and soft and I could tell that it would leave my hair very silky.  BB products also smell divine.  The BB products neutralized the golden tones in my medium blond, color treated hair, leaving no gray or purple residue, and left my hair smooth, soft, strong and very shiny.  My hair also had a lot of swing and body.  There is simply no comparison between Shimmer Lights and Blond Brilliance.  BB is the far superior product.  I have never used a more damaging shampoo than Shimmer Lights.  Anyone who likes it must have a head of Brillo for hair.  I suggest you try BB instead.  It will neutralize the yellow and leave soft, shiny hair in its wake.  The two products couldn&#x27;t be more different.  Shimmer Lights is absolutely terrible and if you care about the health of your hair, you&#x27;ll use Blond Brilliance instead.eft my hair smooth, soft, strong and very shiny.

    <li> The bottle had a small leak and the pump wouldn&#x27;t untwist so I could use it. I poured it into a smaller bottle of the same product. Still worth it due to no shipping charges.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for grey hair as it gives the hair a wonderful shine. The pump on the bottle always delivers the right amount of shampoo. I think this is a most economical way to purchase a product that you use every day.</li>
    <li> I do not color my hair and do have 50/50 gray. This does help with the shine of the gray...non-yellowing. I like the pumper size for easy application. I would recommend this product for those of us that proudly wear our gray &amp;#34;badge of honor&#x27;&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have used Clairol Blue Shimmering Lights for many years, it does the job, keeps my silver hair shining and healthy.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone with gray hair.  I have used it for a couple of years and am very happy with the results.  It came when promised and in excellent shape.</li>
    <li> If you have platinum hair, BUY THIS STUFF!  Use 1-2 times a week, let it sit for a couple minutes and it will help reduce that inevitable warmth as time passes between retouches. This is also a very good deal compared to how much it is in store and will last you a long time.</li>
    <li> This has helped brighten my white hair and is not harsh at all. It has a pleasant scent. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my hair stylist to treat yellowing gray hair.</li>
    <li> Makes hair beautiful!</li>
    <li> Honestly, I love how it works, but I cannot stand the smell. It smells like a bar of zest soap to me. I hate stinky hair.</li>
