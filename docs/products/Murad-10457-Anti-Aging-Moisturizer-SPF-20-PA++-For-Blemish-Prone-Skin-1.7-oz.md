      <li>moisturizer absorbs nicely and the sunscreen is just the right level for my face.  </li>
      <li>Received item as described and very quick.</li>
      <li>I see people have not said good things about some vendors, I have ordered from MD Solutions, they are not the cheapest on amazon but honor amazon return policies, sell new undamaged, unexpired goods and ship very quickly.</li>

      <li>Not bad</li>
      <li>My skin feels very soft &amp; smooth after applying, and I love that it contains sunscreen.</li>
      <li>either they are good for acne, but dry out skin or are super moisturing and reduce wrinkles, but makes me break out....</li>
      <li>I just with it was a higher SPF!</li>
      <li>Fast Shipping too!!</li>
      <li>This product is great for acne but dried up may face.</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t feel this was worth the cost.</li>

      <li>I even return some extra by accident and they mailed it back to me love honest people</li>
      <li>Light, absorbs quickly, my skin feels soft and looks bright after a few weeks of using it.</li>
      <li>It probably wouldn&#x27;t have worked as well for me back in my acne-prone teenage years, but it works great now for my thirtysomething skin.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need to use very much</li>
      <li>Im over 30 and still get pimples pretty often.  </li>
      <li>This worked great, put it on in the morning, and was in the sun til late afternoon and never got sunburned.  </li>
      <li>Found a much better price on Amazon so went back to Murad.</li>
      <li>I first tried this item in the $40 sample kit from Ulta.</li>
      <li>I love this moisturizer for daily wear, even under makeup.</li>
      <li>I cannot say how much the money is worth the product.</li>
      <li>I switched from Obagi, which is twice the price to Murad and am much happier!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> One of my favorites, if you have oilly acne prone skin give this a try. The price on amazon is an absolute steal, buy it here and not on Sephora or Ulta. The best way to apply this, in my experience is to rub it in your hands a little first. If i just glob a lot on it feels very greasy.</li>
    <li> I Love the Murad Products. Amazon has the greatest prices on these products.</li>
    <li> Great fast service would use again.</li>
    <li> Light, absorbs quickly, my skin feels soft and looks bright after a few weeks of using it. I wear Light makeup over it daily.</li>
    <li> love this! perfect for my T-zones!</li>
    <li> okay but still like the original skin clearing lotion</li>
    <li> This is my favorite moisturizer to wear under makeup. It is light and non-greasy and smells so good! I switched from Obagi, which is twice the price to Murad and am much happier!</li>
    <li> Nice and light! Doesn&#x27;t clog pores</li>
    <li> I first tried this item in the $40 sample kit from Ulta. It cleared up my minor adult acne. Liked it but didn&#x27;t like the price I would have had to pay for the full size to replace it. So, I tried a Neutrogena brand. It worked but was too drying to my 49 year old skin. Found a much better price on Amazon so went back to Murad. Plan on continuing with it since it works and does not dry my skin out.</li>
    <li> Dries quickly and skin feels great all day</li>
    <li> This product is great for acne but dried up may face.</li>
    <li> Love this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer absorbs nicely and the sunscreen is just the right level for my face.  I highly recommend Murad!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding moisturizer that is anti-aging, but also works for blemish-prone skin. I&#x27;m 31 and still break out, but I want to use anti-aging cream. I like that this is SPF 20. The product is a little thick and smells a bit like sunscreen, but it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts. I&#x27;m not sure it will be enough moisture for a dry winter climate, but I&#x27;m happy to use something heavier at night for that. Amazon sells it much cheaper than Sephora or other beauty stores.</li>
    <li> Not what I hoped but still somewhat satisfied.</li>
    <li> As expected!  Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Perfect! Fast Shipping too!!</li>
    <li> This is my second one. It is the perfect coverage for warmer months!</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer and I really like that it has spf 20. I&#x27;ve had trouble in the past using moisturizers with spf because they would clog my pores and break me out. This one has really been great- no break outs, not greasy, and has a nice amount of hydration. The price on here is also great! I was weary that it would not be an authentic product because of the price but it is definitely authentic and will be a staple in my skincare routine.</li>
    <li> Love Mudad and this was an awesome price!!</li>
    <li> Outstanding product! Great value for the price. Will definitely shop with them again!</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and this feels incredibly greasy to me. It works very well as a sunscreen, but as a moisturizer is feels very heavy to me. I have to put on several layers of translucent powder to keep shine down when wearing this product.</li>
    <li> Received item as described and very quick. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is the only moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts for me. I am a 25 year old male with mild to moderate acne. This has helped stop breakouts and treat the existing one. Shipped fast and packaging was new.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer. Most moisturizers make me break out, but this does not. My skin feels very soft &amp; smooth after applying, and I love that it contains sunscreen. Murad Skin Perfecting lotion is nicer &amp; more hydrating, but I need something with SPF! It&#x27;s not THAT much different, and the sunscreen factor is worth it. If you have very dry skin, this may not be the one for you, but combo to regular skin and you should be good to go. I cannot comment on the anti-aging aspect, I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know much about this product except it was requested and was well received.  Apparently it is a well known product to the recipient and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Not thrilled with scent, but it does the job</li>
    <li> Just love this lotion. And it already has SPF in it!</li>
    <li> DO NOT USE THIS MURAD PRODUCT IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO ASPIRIN OR ANY OF ITS INGRIDIENTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product as a part of Murad Adult Acne Treatment which I have terrible reactions to. It contained SALICYLIC ACID which the main metabolite of ASPIRIN. I only used it for a month. Reactions generally occur within a few hours of putting the cream on. The reaction includes;&lt;br /&gt;HIVES,&lt;br /&gt;ITCHY SKIN,&lt;br /&gt;SWELLING OF MY LIPS, MY TONGUE AND MY FACE,&lt;br /&gt;COUGHING, WHEEZING AND SHORTNESS OF BREATH&lt;br /&gt;AND THE WORST;&lt;br /&gt;ANAPHYLAXIS — a rare, life-threatening allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;Anaphylaxis requires an immediate trip to the emergency department and an injection of epinephrine. I was hospitilised 4 times in a month. Several blood samples and at the end doctors finally found why?? SALICYLIC ACID in the MURAD PRODUCTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Murad should obliged to WARN CUSTOMERS WHO ARE ALLERGIC TO ASPIRIN SHOULD AVOID from this product line which ANY OF ITS INGRIDIENTS is SALICYLIC ACID.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE THIS MURAD PRODUCT IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO ASPIRIN OR ANY OF ITS INGRIDIENTS.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Don&#x27;t expect it to work instantly, though. After three or four weeks of using it twice a day, my skin has become noticeably softer, smoother, and more glowy (is glowy a word?). I use it in combination with Persa-Gel10 spot treatment for the occasional breakout, and it&#x27;s kept my skin pretty blemish-free. It probably wouldn&#x27;t have worked as well for me back in my acne-prone teenage years, but it works great now for my thirtysomething skin. I plan to purchase it again when this tube runs out.</li>
    <li> After using Neutrogena for years it just didn&#x27;t work as well anymore. I have adult acne that is stress related cystic type and have sensitive skin too. Murad works beautifully. It keeps my skin clear and blemish free, not completely, but unnoticeably, no redness, no flaking, no oilyness or dry patches. My eye area is doing so well with it too. I cannot say how much the money is worth the product. I see people have not said good things about some vendors, I have ordered from MD Solutions, they are not the cheapest on amazon but honor amazon return policies, sell new undamaged, unexpired goods and ship very quickly. I keep my routine simple, use face wash, anti-aging / blemish serum and a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I got such a good deal on this product, but now it&#x27;s back to it&#x27;s original price! Love this brand and this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products on the market and I really like this one because it is anti aging, has spf for daytime and I live in a sunny climate, and acne preventing properties. Non greasy, and lightweight. Works without over drying the skin which is very important.</li>
    <li> I suffer from monthly breakouts but this sunscreen helps keep my skin clear.  It absorbs and doesn&#x27;t leave a film on my skin or a sunscreen smell.  Will continue to purchase as long as its offered!</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY moisturizer that I use. I have tried so many that I cannot even count them and they always leave my face oily or greasy, or make me break out. Not only does this moisturizer not leave my face greasy, but it doesn&#x27;t make me break out. I like that it has sunscreen in it the most, so I have an extra layer of protection for my face. I bought this product in store for double the price I paid on here, and I can tell no difference between the product that I bought in store, and on amazon. Mine can with the foil seal on the packaging as well, so I am sure that it is the same product at a great price!</li>
    <li> Face broke out, but return was no problem. I even return some extra by accident and they mailed it back to me love honest people</li>
    <li> Awesome! I love this moisturizer for daily wear, even under makeup. My face is nearly shine free even after a long day of work. I went one day without using this moisturizer, used what I used to use just for one day and it was SHINE CENTRAL that day. That made me realize just how well it works. I love that it has sunscreen and no parabens. I have also noticed a lessening of my laugh lines and such. Not a heavy formula at all! Very light and refreshing!</li>
    <li> Awesome product, unbeatable price!</li>
    <li> Not bad but I&#x27;m not a big fan of the unscented. Maybe a scented one will make me want to use it again</li>
    <li> awsome with spf great not greasy</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer, been using it about 5 years now</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer! It&#x27;s the only one that doesn&#x27;t break me out. I just with it was a higher SPF!</li>
    <li> it leaves my skin greasy.  I use it in combination with the matching face wash.  I didn&#x27;t see any clearing of my adult acne (age 30).  I don&#x27;t have a lot of acne but I didn&#x27;t feel this was worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Love this, great for oily aging skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best day time moisturizer. Does not feel greasy or heavy. Absorbs quickly, and keeps skin blemish free.</li>
    <li> This was suppose to be an anti blemish lotion and made my face break out. Waste of money, will never buy this product again.</li>
    <li> best moisturizer ever</li>
    <li> This is a daily driver!!!  I love it.  Im over 30 and still get pimples pretty often.  This and other Murad products have cut back on my pimples without drying out my skin.  I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer!  Leaves my skin very soft, never greasy!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 6 months now in combination with the other products from the Murad acne line. It is a great moisturizer, and it does not make me break out or make my skin feel oily. I would definitely recommend this as well as any other Murad product.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is very light, doesn&#x27;t not feel thick or caked on your skin.  I love that it has sunscreen in it so that saves me an extra step.  Since I have been using the Murad line I have noticed a huge improvement in my skin.  I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with how quickly I received my order! And I just love Murad products!! This is a new moisturizer I am trying on my face as I struggle with acne as an older adult. I have used it a couple of times and it&#x27;s wonderful under my makeup. Will recommend this product to all of my friends!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It is light, and does not break me out.</li>
    <li> Still seems a little oily for my face.  I&#x27;m going to try the mattifier next.</li>
    <li> I wear this moisturizer everyday and I love it.  It doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily - just protects it and keeps it from getting dry.  I do have blemish prone skin so this is what my facialist recommended, and it does feel soothing on my sometimes problem skin.  You don&#x27;t need to use very much so I probably only buy 2-3 of these tubes a year for everyday use.  With Amazon Prime, this is the best price I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> For having such a high SPF this product absorbs well. I feel a little greasy after a whole day in the summer but it&#x27;s nothing major and certainly doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts. I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this and am using in conjunction with the face wash and my skin has definitely improved. It&#x27;s not perfect but nothing is ever a &amp;#34;miracle skin cure.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is smoother and less prone to breakouts.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few months now, and absolutely love the way it works! I noticed a reduction in the number of breakouts right away, and my skin feels smooth and soft, even in cold weather. This is the first product I&#x27;ve ever used that was successful in getting rid of extra oil without causing excessive dryness. I definitely recommend everyone with oily skin to give this a try.</li>
    <li> Anything with a sunscreen is always a plus. It has a nice consistency and work great as a moisturizer. The anti-acne part, I really didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
    <li> I am 40+, have both hormonal acne and aging skin.....needless to say there are very few products out there that will take care of both issues....either they are good for acne, but dry out skin or are super moisturing and reduce wrinkles, but makes me break out....this is the only moisturizer out there that does what it says. I have tried them all...trust me.  This price is just fabulous too</li>
    <li> I love it so far. I have been using it for a little over a week and I can tell a huge difference in my skin! So nice to find a good face lotion, I will continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> for the price it is great.  I use it under foundation.</li>
    <li> Bought this because I was going on vacation and have trouble with sunscreen on my face burning.  This worked great, put it on in the morning, and was in the sun til late afternoon and never got sunburned.  No sting from the sunscreen, either.  I prefer pump bottles rather than tubes, so I transferred to another bottle with a pump top and worked fine, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have use this product over 7 months now and it work great.  I have very combination skin tone and having so much trouble with ance. This product has help me minimize my large pore and ance vanished as months go by.</li>
    <li> I love this product and the rest of this line!! I have terrible skin and now I get complements on my skin all the time! I will continue using this line!!!</li>
    <li> Love it for keeping my skin safe and free of breakouts.</li>
    <li> Moisture without oil and blemishes</li>
    <li> Love this stuff - not greasy, good for spring as the weather is changing too.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my 35 yr old acne prone skin</li>
