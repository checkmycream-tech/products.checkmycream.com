      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I depend a lot on reviews myself and sometimes still will buy something with the idea it might work better for me then the reviewer.  </li>
      <li>i was expecting more...</li>
      <li>Now I use it on my hair every time after I shampoo -- it makes my hair feel stronger, silkier, healthy, and keeps the frizz away.  </li>
      <li>If you plan on just washing and air drying, you might be better off just using some argan or coconut oil.</li>
      <li>Great stuff, fast delivery</li>
      <li>I found this about 6 months ago and my hair has never looked better.  </li>
      <li>Most products for the hair make mine crunchy.  </li>
      <li>Okay, as for the smell - it&#x27;s almost non existent.</li>
      <li>The keratin conditioner is very good and makes your hair feel soft and easy to manage.</li>
      <li>Purchased this from Pure Beauty out of curiosity and absolutely love this product in my hair!</li>

      <li>This keeps it smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair tangle free and it blows out silky smooth.</li>
      <li>The product is good and leaves my hair soft.</li>
      <li>Perfect to tame hair in humid climates.  </li>
      <li>Not that great unless you plan on blow drying or flat ironing your hair.</li>
      <li>I went to the closest Sally Beauty and was giving a great product that literally melted the color off and allowed me to put a toner on my hair which brought it back almost exactly to the color I started with.  </li>
      <li>good product, it works well when you have a keratin treatment, it makes last longer.</li>
      <li>I believe that you have to pay to get quality but in this case the quality that it delivered, while not bad, to me did not justify the price I paid.  </li>
      <li>My new (and awesome) hairstylist told me if I was going to use SunIn I needed to use a leave-in conditioner with keratin (or some other protein-based conditioner).</li>
      <li>I have been using this product and other items in the line andit is by far the best hair product I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Most don&#x27;t live up to their hype.  </li>
      <li>This product leaves my hair feeling very soft like silk - love it.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair feel really silky and smooth.</li>
      <li>Works great; smooths hair without leaving it feeling heavy or greasy.  </li>
      <li>I spray it on the back and ends (not the root or crown area) and it makes my hair silky smooth and full of body.  </li>
      <li>The 30 day treatment and application method works well after I wash my hair, apply and set with a hot hair iron.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m hoping that with regular use my hair will be in better shape.</li>
      <li>I have found the same and some better at a fraction of the cost.   </li>
      <li>Works very well even after first use.</li>
      <li>I first tried this product several months ago when I received a free bottle with my shampoo purchase from Ulta.</li>
      <li>This stuff really adds a kick to the treatment, making my hair shiny and lay down so nicely.</li>
      <li>Some work well for certain people while others not so much.  </li>
      <li>I found the best results come from using just a little while your hair is towel dried, before blow drying.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much.  </li>
      <li>so I was looking for something to really give it \\&quot;CPR\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>delivered fast.  </li>
      <li>It worked well and recommend it if you want to calm the curl but don&#x27;t want to straighten your hair completely.</li>
      <li>Before I apply the conditioner I towel-dry my hair really well.</li>
      <li>I do like it because it&#x27;s super light and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
      <li>This is a more natural feel and after using it regularly and staying off the harsh stuff, my hair is a lot softer and more manageable.</li>
      <li>Then I use just a little bit more after my hair is dried, but still warm from the blow dryer.  </li>
      <li>Most products weigh it down.  </li>
      <li>In the last six months several people have told me how healthy my hair looks.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this.  </li>
      <li>I suppose all hair is created differently, and some people may have success with it.</li>
      <li>My new must have product.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair, but I have a lot of it, so it looks thick when I can find the right products to use on it.  </li>
      <li>Since using this, I don&#x27;t need any other styling products and am able to blow dry my hair relatively straight.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure which has the most Keratin</li>
      <li>product does not really do anything.. smells nice and weights the hair down a bit when i&#x27;m indoors..</li>
      <li>This keratin system reduces the waves but does not flatten them completely without the use of a hair iron after every shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my hair soft and controlled.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a product that would help my professionally keratin treated hair</li>
      <li>My hair is natural and can&#x27;t take a lot of oil</li>
      <li>While it worked to a degree I would not say that it was worth the money I have spent.  </li>
      <li>It makes wet African American hair easy to comb out and manageable.</li>
      <li>I used this to calm down the frizz.</li>
      <li>It is very reasonable and last a long time.</li>
      <li>It took a while and 20 purchases of other products later to find the right one and this is it.</li>
      <li>The sprayer sprays wildly though and end up on my face and outward rather than only hair.</li>
      <li>Left my hair soft and silky, not heavy and weighted down.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> just so so- skip this, not worth the money spent</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  My hair feels and looks like a million bucks when I use it.</li>
    <li> I use this daily as part of my regimen after getting a keratin treatment. It makes my hair tangle free and it blows out silky smooth. I believe it helps prolong the effects of the keratin process.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why this Liquid Keratin works so well.. but it does! I have Big, thick curly, frizzy hair- and that&#x27;s after a keratin treatment...This stuff really adds a kick to the treatment, making my hair shiny and lay down so nicely. Btw- I like the smell!</li>
    <li> Great product to use in between shampoos as well.  Perfect to tame hair in humid climates.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I use sun-in to lighten my hair &amp; never realized that it&#x27;s peroxide and it was destroying my hair. My new (and awesome) hairstylist told me if I was going to use SunIn I needed to use a leave-in conditioner with keratin (or some other protein-based conditioner). I was having a really hard time finding what I wanted on the shelves in stores so I looked on Amazon. I actually purchased 3 different products; this, Chi Keratin, and Chi Keratin Mist. I&#x27;m not sure which has the most Keratin but I like all three. I wet and condition my hair daily but do not shampoo every day. Before I apply the conditioner I towel-dry my hair really well. Then I blow-dry slighly so that my hair isn&#x27;t too wet so that the conditioner isn&#x27;t diluted. I have very fine hair but none of these products make my hair feel heavy or dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Chi mist is easiest to apply because it&#x27;s a fine mist. Chi Keratin and LiquidKeratin are a bit thicker so I use my hand as a shield to catch the overspray and rub the excess into my roots.  It makes my hair feel really silky and smooth. Currently my hair is still really damanged and I have a lot of broken ends that make my hair look frizzy. This helps tame the damage and I&#x27;m hoping that with regular use my hair will be in better shape.</li>
    <li> I used this to calm down the frizz. It worked well and recommend it if you want to calm the curl but don&#x27;t want to straighten your hair completely.</li>
    <li> I have blonde hair that is wavie and slightly curlie - basically wild.  The 30 day treatment and application method works well after I wash my hair, apply and set with a hot hair iron. I follow the directions and keep my hair dry for at least 48 hours afterware. But the next time I wash my hair - with the Liquid Keratin Shampoo and condition with the Keratin conditioner, I have to straighten my hair all over again.  This leave-in conditioner helps a great deal. This keratin system reduces the waves but does not flatten them completely without the use of a hair iron after every shampoo.  It does eliminate the frizzies and after I straighten with the hair iron, it looks great!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, but I have a lot of it, so it looks thick when I can find the right products to use on it.  Most products weigh it down.  I found this about 6 months ago and my hair has never looked better.  I spray it on the back and ends (not the root or crown area) and it makes my hair silky smooth and full of body.  In the last six months several people have told me how healthy my hair looks.  I have also gotten compliments on my hair color and my cut - but I think it has to do with how well it lays and manageable it is from using this product.  I highly recommend this.  I don&#x27;t use the other products in the line however because I use a thickening shampoo and condition.  It is very reasonable and last a long time.</li>
    <li> The keratin conditioner is very good and makes your hair feel soft and easy to manage.However the shape of bottle is impossible for me to handle, I spray the liquid in my hand and apply it that way.DeShane</li>
    <li> I have thick, frizzy hair.  Since using this, I don&#x27;t need any other styling products and am able to blow dry my hair relatively straight.  Just need the flat iron for a little touch up afterwards.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff......the bottle is tiny and so expensive :( my hair is really long so I use a lot of it . The spray nozzle of the bottle broke on second use...that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve given it four stars</li>
    <li> I ordered this item after paying for someone to color my hair.  The color came out so bad and she told me that there was nothing that she could do but add some highlights and wait for it to grow out.  I went to the closest Sally Beauty and was giving a great product that literally melted the color off and allowed me to put a toner on my hair which brought it back almost exactly to the color I started with.  The bad thing about all that is my hair was dry and damaged so I was looking for something to really give it \\&quot;CPR\\&quot;.  While it worked to a degree I would not say that it was worth the money I have spent.  I believe that you have to pay to get quality but in this case the quality that it delivered, while not bad, to me did not justify the price I paid.  I have found the same and some better at a fraction of the cost.   I depend a lot on reviews myself and sometimes still will buy something with the idea it might work better for me then the reviewer.  With the price of this item I would think twice before using that reasoning.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product and other items in the line andit is by far the best hair product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I first tried this product several months ago when I received a free bottle with my shampoo purchase from Ulta. Now I use it on my hair every time after I shampoo -- it makes my hair feel stronger, silkier, healthy, and keeps the frizz away.  It is not sticky or greasy at all, like some of the oil based leave-in products on the market.  Also, I get keratin smoothing treatments every 3-4 months, and this product totally complements the effects of those treatments. I hope they never stop making this.!!!</li>
    <li> I have used Liquid Keratin for about 1 year now in combination with other supposed remedies in an effort to try to combat female pattern hair loss.  I have always loved the smell of this product.  However, this time the smell has changed into something that to me smells like animal urine or close.  In order to tolerate the smell, I need to mix Victoria Secret&#x27;s perfume with the leave-in conditioner, so I am not sure how this is going to affect my female pattern hair loss, but will probably be detrimental.</li>
    <li> Not that great unless you plan on blow drying or flat ironing your hair. If you plan on just washing and air drying, you might be better off just using some argan or coconut oil.</li>
    <li> Love it. it helps a lot with my frizzy hair</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend. She did not like it at all. Said it didn&#x27;t make any difference at all to her hair. I suppose all hair is created differently, and some people may have success with it.</li>
    <li> I feel like this did nothing for my hair.</li>
    <li> helps tame my thick wavy indian hair!!! must have, will be ordering again soon.does not go on greasy, and smells great!</li>
    <li> Its a great product it really works well and it brings the shine and softness out of my hair</li>
    <li> Best keratin leave-in product out there. It took a while and 20 purchases of other products later to find the right one and this is it.</li>
    <li> very surprised at how good this product is, great value for the cost. Found it really helped my thick hair relax!</li>
    <li> Great stuff, fast delivery</li>
    <li> The product is good and leaves my hair soft. The sprayer sprays wildly though and end up on my face and outward rather than only hair. I have to spray it into my hand and dispense, which sort of defeats the purpose of a spray bottle.</li>
    <li> I will always buy this&lt;br /&gt;excellent results</li>
    <li> help to de-frizz me hair</li>
    <li> Works great; smooths hair without leaving it feeling heavy or greasy.  I also feel that it protects my hair from heat styling. And I love the smell!</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft and controlled.  Most products for the hair make mine crunchy.  I hate that.  This is a more natural feel and after using it regularly and staying off the harsh stuff, my hair is a lot softer and more manageable.</li>
    <li> I am 58 and wear my hair to my shoulders. This keeps it smooth and silky. I get tons of compliments--especially from my husband! What could be better?!</li>
    <li> Love the smell, works great too. delivered fast.  Gets out the tangles, and doesnt leave a film on the hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used about a bazillion hair care products in my lifetime.  Most don&#x27;t live up to their hype.  Some work well for certain people while others not so much.  I was looking for a product that would help my professionally keratin treated hair keeps it&#x27;s silkiness longer.  I think I must have gone through 5 or 6 different products before I found this one.  I was about to give up and just get another $400.00 treatment. Then, I found it!  Yes!  Something that does what it says it does!  YAY!  It isn&#x27;t sticky, doesn&#x27;t build up, and doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair.  It&#x27;s a spray, but slightly thick, so I spray it in my hands. rub them together, then dap it on my hair. It doesn&#x27;t take much.  I found the best results come from using just a little while your hair is towel dried, before blow drying.  Then I use just a little bit more after my hair is dried, but still warm from the blow dryer.  I think it will last quite a while and I&#x27;ll definitely re-order when it&#x27;s empty.  Okay, as for the smell - it&#x27;s almost non existent. It won&#x27;t compete with whatever scent you&#x27;re wearing.</li>
    <li> good product, it works well when you have a keratin treatment, it makes last longer.</li>
    <li> Works very well even after first use.</li>
    <li> This product leaves my hair feeling very soft like silk - love it.</li>
    <li> product does not really do anything.. smells nice and weights the hair down a bit when i&#x27;m indoors.. but when the weather is humid or misty, my hair gets frizzy... disappointed with product... i was expecting more...</li>
    <li> Mine has no scent. I do like it because it&#x27;s super light and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down. Will continue using.</li>
    <li> Purchased this from Pure Beauty out of curiosity and absolutely love this product in my hair! It is like liquid gold, calms the frizzies and actually works well for straightening or wearing curly. Will be purchasing more through Amazon now!</li>
    <li> It works well.  It takes care of the frizz without destroying your hair</li>
    <li> I love it. It does help a lot with the frizz.</li>
    <li> I did not like that it is liquid and spray, hard to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells horrible!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks nice and more controlled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this product again, I will keep searching</li>
    <li> Works awesome. My new must have product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used ths product for quite some time. It makes wet African American hair easy to comb out and manageable. Leaves blow dried hair shiny/glossy without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> This is a fairly good conditioner. However, it did not moisturize my hair as well as I would have expected it to, based on the advertising.</li>
    <li> Best leave in I have ever used. My hair is shiny and silky now</li>
    <li> Left my hair soft and silky, not heavy and weighted down. My hair is natural and can&#x27;t take a lot of oil so this was perfect.</li>
</ol>
