      <li>It has a flawless finish, and the handle is easy to  grip.</li>

      <li>You might find that to be a good thing.  </li>
      <li>I used an astra superior platinum blade.  </li>
      <li>If your shaving technique is good, this razor should work for about everybody.  </li>
      <li>The truth is this razor does as good as any of them.</li>
      <li>I use it almost exclusively for my head, and I am very pleased.</li>
      <li>The 15c head has an elegant curve to it and the knurling on the handle, threads that hold the head on to the handle, spacing of the comb teeth and so forth are all very nice.</li>
      <li>Very nice razor of top quality.</li>
      <li>I sure wish there was also a closed-comb version of this razor!</li>
      <li>AWESOME PURCHASE, my first Safety razor and I could not be happier.</li>

      <li>I believe Astra to be the best all-around blade for the money.</li>
      <li>The 3-piece is the best for traveling if you need a very compact package.</li>
      <li>Nice shave.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d like to keep my antique razor nice.  </li>
      <li>The shaves are nice and close with no undue skin slicing or nicks.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice razor for the price.</li>
      <li>This means that the normal finger-tip grips will work best.</li>
      <li>It has a good weight and is easily maneuverable.</li>
      <li>- I&#x27;ve been using my cheap plastic Feather razor, which is quite good.</li>
      <li>But for someone with sensitive skin this razor would probably be wonderful.  </li>
      <li>Sure looks like a nice razor.  </li>
      <li>This is a very outstanding razor, it is very well made and works just great, I get just as good a shave with it as I do with my original Gillettes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great razor but not what I&#x27;d ordered (mine came via &amp;#34;Focus Corp&amp;#34;).</li>
      <li>For the classic one-and-done one-pass shave, it does a good job -- as good as any.</li>
      <li>This is a very smooth razor .</li>
      <li>Okay on the face too,</li>
      <li>These are my favorite features.  </li>
      <li>You could disassemble and pack this into an altoids tin :)  </li>
      <li>One of the better shaves I&#x27;ve had - zero injuries.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s much better for the environment as well.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been mostly using my Merkur 37c Slant and decided to try the 15c again.</li>
      <li>This razor is not aggressive, it is however efficient, more so then most of my comparable close comb razors, most notable when shaving my neck, always a problem area for me.  </li>
      <li>I will say that using a safety razor requires more technique and attention to what you&#x27;re doing to get a close shave without nicks (order a styptic pencil while you&#x27;re at it).  </li>
      <li>I had bought this with the intention for a more aggressive, but comparable companion to my 34C, but it is so diminutive, that it has been relegated to the travel bag.</li>
      <li>But love this one.</li>
      <li>I read somewhere that the innovation of the bar was mostly about strengthening the razor against damage if dropped (probably cheaper to make too)</li>
      <li>You will not get many nicks with this.</li>
      <li>I also have tried many razor blades, including Feather, Personna, Derby and Astra.</li>
      <li>If I were you, I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than about $20.</li>
      <li>More research (by me) on the Internet would have revealed that most reviewers find it to be quite mild.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The open comb along with the blade angle are excellent and I don’t fear being cut.</li>
      <li>Merkur is top notch quality, and this razor is fantastic!</li>
      <li>I ordered this razor because I wanted something more aggressive than my Merkur 34C HD.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can spend more.</li>
      <li>(Don&#x27;t hold it like a paint scraper. :-)  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s really a great value and could easily be someone&#x27;s first safety razor.  </li>
      <li>I get a good shave on the first pass, and get an excellent shave on a second pass.</li>
      <li>If you want an open-comb razor that is a mild, comfortable shaver from a well-established brand this could be a good choice for you.</li>
      <li>This razor is a mild razor, but it does a nice job.</li>
      <li>It would make an excellent first razor for anyone new to DE shaving.</li>
      <li>No nicks no razor burn on my sensitive skin, no blood loss, just a great shave.  </li>
      <li>I just want something comfortable to use and easy on the face with good results, That is exactly what I get with this razor.</li>
      <li>The threaded portion is made more accurately than my Edwin Jagger and the rounded end of threads make assembly easy.  </li>
      <li>That made it easy to change the blade without having to precariously hold it.</li>
      <li>Easy to maintain</li>
      <li>Blades are easy to load and remove.</li>
      <li>Very mild shaver.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice open comb razor with a very smooth and effective shave.</li>
      <li>If you are a stylist/barber, etc., this would make a fine choice as trimming longer hairs is part of the job.  </li>
      <li>The EJ89 is a fine razor, and Gillette Tech razors (from the 1930s thru 70s) do a fine job too.</li>
      <li>light weight probably contributes to the very mild shaves it gives.  </li>
      <li>I took a chance on the OPEN comb, and am very glad that I did!</li>
      <li>The handle is thinner than my Merkur 37c Slant Bar, but for me it seems just as comfortable.</li>
      <li>Great Double Edge razor.  </li>
      <li>I could achieve the baby smooth shave</li>
      <li>The razor has a nice heft to it that I think keeps you from applying too much force to the blade when shaving.</li>
      <li>Maybe too light for a double-edge razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>That makes for light weight.  </li>
      <li>However I&#x27;m sure with a good blade and multiple passes</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty balanced, with maybe a bit more in the handle.</li>
      <li>It is not a decoration as it provides a significant grip advantage.</li>
      <li>, just clean when you change razor blades.  </li>

    <li> This razor is a mild razor, but it does a nice job. It looks very much like a Gillette 20s Old Style, but it lacks the aggression. It has a flawless finish, and the handle is easy to  grip. I have seen complaints of the handle being too small, but it is the same diameter as the ball end handles of the 20s. It has a good weight and is easily maneuverable.</li>
    <li> Great Entry level Safety Razor. This Safety razor paired with your blade of choice is a great start for anyone trying out Safety razor shaving.</li>
    <li> It is really quite thin in the hand. I had bought this with the intention for a more aggressive, but comparable companion to my 34C, but it is so diminutive, that it has been relegated to the travel bag.</li>
    <li> Put down the mach 87 and cancel your membership to Dollar Shave Club. This is the last razor you&#x27;ll ever need. Buy this some proraso and feather blades and a good aftershave and save your money while getting a great shave!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Edwin Jaegger&#x27;s 89, a Merkur slant, a Weber all-stainless, an Ikon Shavecraft 101 and several antique razors. The truth is this razor does as good as any of them. The EJ89 is a fine razor, and Gillette Tech razors (from the 1930s thru 70s) do a fine job too. I prefer the open comb - easier to cut longer hair and easier to keep clean while shaving. All of them can meet or beat a Mach 3, let alone a mowing machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can spend more. You can try different weight handles, various creams &amp; soaps, etc - but if you keep your face wet while shaving, use light pressure, keep the razor at the right angle and don&#x27;t try to get total perfection everywhere - it will grow back, and the finest shave is no longer the finest shave 2 hours later - then this razor removes the hair just fine. Shaving isn&#x27;t a mystical experience. It doesn&#x27;t unite us with the Universe or lead us to God. It just removes hair for a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this razor and 100 blades for $10, soap up or use your favorite canned cream, and see what less than $35 can do for you. With a little practice, this will give you a Mach 3 or better shave and you can buy blades for 10 cents each instead of putting your house up for collateral to buy 8-bladed wonders.</li>
    <li> Very mild shaver.  Was my first open comb safety razor.  Performs very well for being so mild.  Good razor if new to safety razors or open combs.</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to use this razor and for my sensitive skin, it was not a good match. I tried it with Derby, Feather, and Personna blades.  Performance was similar with each blade.  This razor presents the blade at an angle that causes irritation to my skin without providing a close shave.  Of course there may be a blade that works better for me in this razor, but I was not willing to search any longer.  Of course, this is my experience. Yours may be much different.  The build quality is excellent. The threaded portion is made more accurately than my Edwin Jagger and the rounded end of threads make assembly easy.  Cross threading is not a concern. I have to be much more careful with my Edwin Jagger.  While some may complain about the diameter and length of the handle, I found them ideal. These are my favorite features.  The handle also has real, tool quality knurling.  It is not a decoration as it provides a significant grip advantage. It is clearly a well made product.  This open comb model and this particular style razor head are what makes this razor not well suited for me.  I do believe that a Merkur razor with a closed comb, safety bar head would provide a better experience.  Overall, I was underwhelmed with this razor.  I really wanted to like it.  While the current price ($23) makes it tempting, spending a few dollars more will result in a much better shave.  Amazon has the Edwin Jagger Kelvin for under $30.  It is a smooth shaving razor and well worth your consideration.  Closed comb Merkur razors are also available at this price point.  If you are a stylist/barber, etc., this would make a fine choice as trimming longer hairs is part of the job.  But for the daily pleasure of shaving whiskers, there are better choices.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 50 and recently learned how to shave correctly.  I ditched the multi bladed face scrappers and after much research settled on this line of razor.  It is of very high quality and the head is heavy.  The shaves are nice and close with no undue skin slicing or nicks.  Easy to maintain, just clean when you change razor blades.  This is definitely a razor that will last the rest of my shaving days.  If you are on the fence, go for it.</li>
    <li> I bought this and also received Merkur&#x27;s slant razor instead of the 15c (the slant has a slanted blade and, I think, a thicker handle). It&#x27;s a great razor but not what I&#x27;d ordered (mine came via &amp;#34;Focus Corp&amp;#34;).</li>
    <li> Although this one looks just like the Mekur I&#x27;ve had for 15 years it is not the same. My previous one unscrewed from the very bottom of the handle leaving a shaft that was still attached to the top portion. That made it easy to change the blade without having to precariously hold it. Not so with this one. The entire head comes off with just a little screw &amp;#34;nub&amp;#34; left attached. That leaves you with the entire head portion. Manipulating the comb portion and the very top piece while changing the blade becomes a little daunting.</li>
    <li> I did a great deal of research before purchasing. Reading reviews, the how to&#x27;s, the advantages and the minimal disadvantages. Only thing, I haven&#x27;t used it yet. I am optimistic though.</li>
    <li> Nice shave. As an amateur DE razor user...  Comb works well... I am guessing so that I don&#x27;t lop off any needed parts on my face and neck.  I have only been using the razor for about a month now... and I am still haveing to refine my techinique.  Yes, I am butchering my face everytime I shave - reminds me of some teenage years!&lt;br /&gt;The handle is a bit short.  I like to grab a hold of my razor... this fits about halfway through my palm.&lt;br /&gt;It is hefty... which I like.</li>
    <li> An excellent razor.  I found a late-20&#x27;s Gillette old style open comb in an antique store, and it became my absolute favorite razor to shave my head.  Okay on the face too, but I prefer a mid-50&#x27;s red tip for that.  Anyhow, using a 90 year old razor when I can get a near exact replica didn&#x27;t seem like the best idea.  I&#x27;d like to keep my antique razor nice.  This Merkur Razor proved perfect.  I use it almost exclusively for my head, and I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I still use my Murkur open comb to this day. My only complaint would be the chrome coating on the handle is either oxidizing or just plain wearing off. Not the prettiest thing in my cabinet but still offers a fantastic shave. If the head has a little resistance when screwing/unscrewing, you can put a drop of olive oil on the threads between cleanings.</li>
    <li> I like this razor a lot, but it does require care and close attention while shaving to avoid nicks. Also, the comb is somewhat delicate and can become bent if dropped. One very nice thing about an open comb razor is that it really lets the lather get right up to where the cutting edge meets the hairs. I read somewhere that the innovation of the bar was mostly about strengthening the razor against damage if dropped (probably cheaper to make too)</li>
    <li> This open come head is very different from most other Merkur razors. I did like the close shave and the way the head bends the blade.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try an open comb razor, but being fairly new to wet shaving I didn&#x27;t want anything too aggressive. After reading various reviews for the Merkur 15C, this sounded like what I was looking for. Open comb, mild shaver, knurled handle, German made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can attest that the reviews are correct, the shave from this razor is mild. But that is not a negative for me. I am just not into getting the absolute closest shave possible like a lot of other shavers are. I just want something comfortable to use and easy on the face with good results, That is exactly what I get with this razor. However I&#x27;m sure with a good blade and multiple passes I could achieve the baby smooth shave if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, for $26.00 this is a pure bargain.</li>
    <li> So I ordered a 15c.  But what I received?  The Merkur Slant 37c.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad deal spending $20 to get a $50 razor.  So I can&#x27;t say much about the 15c.  Sure looks like a nice razor.  The 37c on the other hand, is a heavy weighted slanted slicing machine.  Its not for beginners and as such, shipping it under the 15c name is probably a little dangerous.</li>
    <li> This is a nice razor for the price. Mine developed a small crack in the chrome plating at the top of the handle soon after purchase but nothing serious enough to warrant a return. The razor has a nice heft to it that I think keeps you from applying too much force to the blade when shaving. Blades are easy to load and remove.</li>
    <li> I recieved the worng item.</li>
    <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t say so in the description, this razor is indeed a Merkur 15c.  I ordered this razor because I wanted something more aggressive than my Merkur 34C HD.  Normally, all else being equal, an open-comb razor is more aggressive (shaves closer) than a similar razor with a solid safety bar.  This razor, however, is not aggressive.  It is a mild razor.  I can&#x27;t blame the razor for being mild though.  It is not advertised as being aggressive.  More research (by me) on the Internet would have revealed that most reviewers find it to be quite mild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it is a beautifully made razor. The open-comb head is quite different from the head on the 34c.  The 15c head has an elegant curve to it and the knurling on the handle, threads that hold the head on to the handle, spacing of the comb teeth and so forth are all very nice. It is quite common to find complaints in reviews about the chrome plating on Merkur razors, but the plating on the 15c that I received (mine came from Focus Corp) was flawless.&lt;br /&gt;The handle was not great (see below) but another good point is that the head from this 15c fit perfectly on the handles that I have for my Edwin Jagger DE89 (and vice versa but I didn&#x27;t want to put the EJ head on the 15c handle).  Ironically, the 15c open-comb head part of this razor fits on all my razor handles... except my other Merkur, because the 34c has a base plate that is permanently attached to its handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;The handle is thin, much thinner than the handle on the 34C or an Edwin Jagger razor.  It reminds me of a yellow number 2 pencil that you might have used in school.  (Do people still use pencils or is it all Tablets now?)  If you can imagine a steel, knurled pencil then you&#x27;ll have the idea.  The picture of the razor on Amazon seems to be distorted or foreshortened, because it really does not give you an accurate idea of just how thin the handle looks or feels in your hand.  The handle is hollow with a hole in the bottom, which is typical of Merkur razors.  That makes for light weight.  Maybe too light for a double-edge razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Neutral:&lt;br /&gt;The light weight probably contributes to the very mild shaves it gives.  As I mentioned above though, you can pair it with a heavier handle, but it&#x27;s still pretty mild.  I just could not get a really close shave with this razor no matter what blade I put in it.  You might find that to be a good thing.  For someone like myself, with a tough beard who often finds it necessary to shave twice a day, mildness isn&#x27;t that desirable.  But for someone with sensitive skin this razor would probably be wonderful.  It would be hard to nick yourself or get razor burn with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an aggressive shaver, this is not your option, even though it has an open-comb head.  If you want an open-comb razor that is a mild, comfortable shaver from a well-established brand this could be a good choice for you.</li>
    <li> I have used Merkur, in the past and this is the second time in a Merkur that The blade does not align equal in both sides of the heat. One side is over espoused and the other barely exposed. It should be equal both sides!!!</li>
    <li> The Merkur 15C is an awesome razor. Very well built, and well balanced. Being an open comb razor I thought that it would be very aggressive, but I was pleasantly surprised. Even though the blade is more exposed because of the open comb, the blade gap keeps the overall shave on the mild side. Even with a Feather blade installed, I was amazed about the mildness of the razor. The other great thing about this razor is the overall weight, as it is substantial. It&#x27;s pretty balanced, with maybe a bit more in the handle. Which is is a good thing for newer wet shavers, as they should let the razor do all the work. This razor is a work of art, well made, and will be one that you can hand down to you son or daughter, for her legs of course, hehe...Happy Shaving!</li>
    <li> I had a long handle, heavy, Merkur (180). I bought this because it was advertized as being for sensitive skin. Satisfied so far. Lighter, smaller and easier to handle.</li>
    <li> This is a very smooth razor . You will not get many nicks with this. If you do it may be the blade or the person driving the razor.</li>
    <li> 04/06/2016 - another update. I&#x27;ve been mostly using my Merkur 37c Slant and decided to try the 15c again. That only confirmed my earlier findings - it shave very well, but really doesn&#x27;t get you as close as other razors, perhaps it&#x27;s on the &amp;#34;safe side&amp;#34; and might be good for some people. If I were you, I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than about $20. Italian Barber website has the RazoRock &amp;#34;Jaws&amp;#34; open comb razor for $20 - that might be a more interesting OC razor to try.  12/14/2015 - I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;ve been neglecting this razor - I&#x27;ve been using my cheap plastic Feather razor, which is quite good. Occasionally would use my Merkur Slant. Yesterday I decided to try the open-comb 15c again. Very nice, zero injuries (used Proraso again). My only comment: it is not as close (ever so slightly) compared to my other razors. I mean my face looked clean and was smooth to touch WTG, but I could feel a little abrasiveness with my hand against the growth. This despite shaving first WTG and then ATG - it&#x27;s really as close as this razor gets.  06/06/2015 - used a fresh Astra SP blade with this and my Proraso &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; (green tea and oatmeal) soap. One of the better shaves I&#x27;ve had - zero injuries. Definitely a mild razor, took me a little extra time to do all the buffing everywhere, but perhaps with the advantage of minimal burn. I will try it with Feather, Wilkinson Sword and Merkur blades that I have on hand to sample.  So far I&#x27;ve changed to 5 stars. For the price of twenty one bucks it&#x27;s really a great value and could easily be someone&#x27;s first safety razor.  Aside from this razor I also have a Van Der Hagen (butterfly one-piece, got it from Target) and a Merkur 37c Slant Bar (2-piece). I like that this razor is also a 3-piece - I like having the 3 different types. The 3-piece is the best for traveling if you need a very compact package. You could disassemble and pack this into an altoids tin :)  The handle is thinner than my Merkur 37c Slant Bar, but for me it seems just as comfortable. The finish on the components appears to be flawless (unfortunately with chrome plating that is no guarantee of corrosion resistance, but we&#x27;ll see).  I will update as I keep using it.  I sure wish there was also a closed-comb version of this razor! For the money (around $20) it&#x27;s a great quality razor! It&#x27;s not as massive as some of the other razors, but still substantial enough, slightly heavier than all the cheapy asian-made butterflies. Instead of being thicker cast brass, the middle piece (guard) is just a bent plate, with the top fitting over it - very simple, but effective. The only reason this can&#x27;t be someone&#x27;s only-razor is because trimming straight lines (i.e. sideburns) is not as easy due to the open comb teeth.</li>
    <li> My Merkur 38 (Barber pole with straight bar edge) was my first and favorite DE razor.  That is, until I bought this little gem.  I bought it as a travel razor, as I didn&#x27;t want to risk damaging or losing my more expensive Merkur 38.  However, I was really surprised that the little Merkur 15C (this razor) actually shaves better, closer, and smoother than it&#x27;s more expensive big brother.  It has become my favorite razor for both traveling and daily use at home.  I&#x27;m sure there are better razors out there at double, triple and even quadruple the price, but I doubt any compete at this price point.  It would make an excellent first razor for anyone new to DE shaving.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: After using this razor for a long while, I&#x27;ve come to appreciate it as a first-pass razor (that is, lather, shave, and rinse). For the classic one-and-done one-pass shave, it does a good job -- as good as any. For those like me with sensitive skin; it may shave just a bit harshly on subsequent passes (that is, re-lather, shave again, rinse) despite otherwise mild characteristics. I now use this fairly regularly as a first-pass razor or for those rare days when I shave one and done. For my second pass (after most first-pass-use razors), I tend to prefer a very mild finishing razor such as the Weishi 9306-F or the Dorco one-piece twist-to-open razors to get near baby smooth without much risk of irritation or wounds. I also keep this 15C at hand because of its unlimited open-comb capacity to trim my back hairline and the back of my neck. If you have really sensitive skin as I do, this may not be your first choice as a multi-pass razor.  This Merkur 15C open-comb razor has a classic handle at about 3 inches in length and the smaller, classic diameter of about 3/8 inch over most of the barrel -- the same handle that&#x27;s on the Merkur 33C and many other razors of classic proportions. This means that the normal finger-tip grips will work best. (Don&#x27;t hold it like a paint scraper. :-)  The harshness of this razor seems to be moderate, not low (as I said, I prefer it for a single-pass shave or as a first-pass razor); though it&#x27;s otherwise a very mild shave, which can still be reasonably close.  The open-comb baseplate doesn&#x27;t restrict the razor&#x27;s capacity, however. This means that even those who skip a few day&#x27;s shaves don&#x27;t need to use a more harsh, higher capacity razor; the comb, instead of the usual safety bar, doesn&#x27;t limit the length of hair that this razor can handle. Good for shaving longer-growth hair, trimming beards, back of neck, mustaches, etc.  If you have a tough or dense beard, be sure to use a sharp blade. If you have sensitive skin, use a blade coatedfor smoothness. If you have both a tough beard and sensitive skin (as I do), then use sharp, coated blades, but it still may not be enough to avoid a little irritation if you make multiple passes.  If your shaving technique is good, this razor should work for about everybody.  Happy shaving! See my articles at shavelikegrandad[dot]blogspot[dot]com (substitute periods for the [dot]s)</li>
    <li> package labeled as Merkur 15c but product was not an open comb 15c, it was slant razor possibly 37c.</li>
    <li> AWESOME PURCHASE, my first Safety razor and I could not be happier.</li>
    <li> This IS THE REAL DEAL. I was surprised how small this razor is.  It is the little big man.  I used an astra superior platinum blade.  No nicks no razor burn on my sensitive skin, no blood loss, just a great shave.  This is a really mild shave which can be used every day and small enough to travel.  The craftsmanship, fit and finish are very high quality.  Very easy to control!!!</li>
    <li> Great Double Edge razor.  I was initially &#x27;scared&#x27; of open comb DE razors, hearing/reading that open comb is more &#x27;aggressive&#x27; then close comb razors.  Well, in reality the &#x27;Openness&#x27; or &#x27;Closeness&#x27; of a razor doesn&#x27;t make it less or more aggressive, it&#x27;s the razor gap and angle of the blade that determine a razor&#x27;s aggressiveness level.  This razor is not aggressive, it is however efficient, more so then most of my comparable close comb razors, most notable when shaving my neck, always a problem area for me.  The open comb, allows the razor to get to the hairs without causing razor burn or irritation.</li>
    <li> I’ve tried them all, and this is the best DE Razor for me. Edwin Jagger is very good , but still doesn’t beat the Merkur 15c. I tried a Merkur 34c and even a stainless steel  Feather razor, neither one compares to the Open Comb Merkur 15c.  The open comb along with the blade angle are excellent and I don’t fear being cut. As for safety, this is the safest among all the razors I have tried. I also have tried many razor blades, including Feather, Personna, Derby and Astra. I believe Astra to be the best all-around blade for the money. I like the Merkur 15c enough to order a second as a back up.  I got mine for $22.00, which is amazing considering the Feather stainless steel razor is $174.00.</li>
    <li> This is a very outstanding razor, it is very well made and works just great, I get just as good a shave with it as I do with my original Gillettes.</li>
    <li> Merkur razors are great. Used them for many years, highly recommended. This transaction was wonderful - great price, delivered on Sunday in two days. However, I received a 37c razor in a 15c box. Always wanted to try the 37c, so I&#x27;m not unhappy, just surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So . . . you will receive a high quality Merkur razor at a low price. That&#x27;s a deal that&#x27;s hard to beat. But be prepared - you may receive a surprise in the package!</li>
    <li> I bought this as an introduction to wet shaving.  Although the handle is short, I have had no qualms with the 15c.  I get a close shave every morning, with no razor burn.  Great razor!</li>
    <li> This is a nice open comb razor with a very smooth and effective shave. There are mixed reviews on this razor, I will just say it is in my rotation, only the best razors get in my rotation.</li>
    <li> The handle is a bit short...its giving me cramps in my hand while I shave.  Other than that, good product.</li>
    <li> Another GREAT razor by Merkur. I love it!!</li>
    <li> Very good razor. Mild razor</li>
    <li> Very nice razor of top quality.</li>
    <li> Received the razor about two weeks ago.  So far I enjoy shaving with it and we&#x27;ll have to see if the novelty wears off.  I&#x27;ve always used a brush with shaving soap so this completes my \\&quot;retro\\&quot; shaving routine (my son has started to use a barber&#x27;s straight razor but I&#x27;m not brave enough to try that!).  I will say that using a safety razor requires more technique and attention to what you&#x27;re doing to get a close shave without nicks (order a styptic pencil while you&#x27;re at it).  You have to use a much lighter touch as the razor has heft to it and proceed more slowly until you get used to it.  You may also experience a little more razor burn at first but some witch hazel or aftershave balm seems to help.  I&#x27;ve only nicked myself once at the beginning so don&#x27;t let my review scare you off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve now been using the razor for about 4 months.  The only time I&#x27;ve nicked myself is when I&#x27;ve shaved over a blemish.  I don&#x27;t think the shave is quite as close as the \\&quot;mach 10 turbocharged diesel\\&quot; razors that cost a small fortune but your wallet will thank you as the blades are much less expensive and it&#x27;s much better for the environment as well.  I finish off the shave with a splash of Clubman aftershave and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
    <li> Took a while to get used to after using the closed style guard for a while but after a few months, I love this razor.</li>
    <li> I had this exact same razor that I used for years, with the exception that it had a CLOSED comb. I had to replace it because of an unfortunate drop from the top of my medicine cabinet. It landed at an odd angle and the handle broke off from the head. I loved that razor, so I wanted to get the same model. I took a chance on the OPEN comb, and am very glad that I did! Excellent, excellent shave. Maybe not for beginners of wet shave, but for the experienced wet shaver, I doubt you could find a closer shave from another razor. I whole heartedly recommend this razor. Merkur is top notch quality, and this razor is fantastic!</li>
    <li> For the money, it is an excellent razor. It is light for a double edge razor, but not too light. Perfect travel razor. Mild enough to shave daily or even twice a day. Yet  it is open comb, so it works well on longer hair and peach fuzz. I get a good shave on the first pass, and get an excellent shave on a second pass. Had it for a couple of months now, and it is holding up well.</li>
    <li> I collect razors. But love this one. its a little agressive, but I like that</li>
