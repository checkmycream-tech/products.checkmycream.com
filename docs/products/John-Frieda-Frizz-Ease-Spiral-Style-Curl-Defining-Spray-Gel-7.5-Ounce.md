      <li>I originally used John Freida Dream Curls for years and find that this product works much better.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m happy to have found products that let me do what I do without all the sturm &amp; drang that comes with having the wonderful world of imperialism all in one head of hair -- anglo around the edges, tight waves towards the crown, then a Chaka Khan explosion as our journey ends in the back.</li>

      <li>Whoever purchases this should not spray onto hair as described in the directions, but spray onto hands first and scrunch.</li>

      <li>It works really well with</li>
      <li>Then I have to use a product salad, diffuser, the whole 9 yards.</li>
      <li>it doest really add shine or bounce or curl definition, but it works to not let it frizz out.</li>
      <li>or it&#x27;s sticky without much definition.</li>
      <li>With just mousse alone my hair is wavy, but with a few sprays of this product on top of the mousse, it curls right up.</li>
      <li>I combine with my other curl gel too , and that works better.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without John Frieda Frizz Ease products!  </li>
      <li>I try and just use a little bit &amp; that work better.</li>
      <li>It works okay, but tends to get stiff, &amp; clumpy in my hair .</li>
      <li>This is the only product I can find that gives just the right bounce to my curls.</li>
      <li>It is not being sold in any store within a 60 mile radius from where I live ( I know this bc I checked)</li>
      <li>My only complaint (and it&#x27;s true of nearly all the hair products I buy, spending more on them than on food - natch)</li>
      <li>good formula for curly hair, i am of mixed race, black and white and i have very curly hair from my moms irish roots.</li>

<li> I highly recommend this product for anyone with curly hair to tame frizz problems.  </li>
<li> This spray is lighter than the average spray gel, so gives you just enough hold without being super sticky or hard!</li>
<li> i spray it in my hand then scrunch it, but its definitely not what i expected</li>
<li> Just simply spray it on your hair wet and scrunch away, it even works well during the day on dry hair.  </li>
<li> Big Hair BAD, Pretty Soft Curls,</li>
<li> i could spritz on wet hair to keep it in check after my showers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It left my hair stiff and sticky.  </li>
<li> I have naturally curly hair that is very thick and course.</li>
<li> Definitely a must have for someone with hard to manage curly, frizzy hair.</li>
<li> You can get it at drugstore.com for $8.99 OR LESS</li>
<li> By following the directions you&#x27;ll likely end up looking like the fellow from Twisted Sister</li>
<li> finally broke down &amp; got one of those chemical blow-dry deals where my stylist uses a flat iron AND a blow dryer with a round brush that felt like the boar was still angry about being used for heat styling.</li>
<li> is gauging the amount I have to use to get the effect I need: too little, and it doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
<li> I was shocked as I really thought i had bought a softer conditioner to make the curls</li>
<li> As usual, this styling spray gel woorks well on my wavy hair.</li>
<li> The reason I started purchasing this here on amazon is because I was disappointed to find it is no longer being carried at any of my local walmart, target or even walgreeens, I hope this doesn&#x27;t mean its being discontinued!  </li>
<li> I am not impressed with this product.  </li>
<li> I was very disappointed when i got this and saw that the spray gel comes out in a stream instead of an all over mist.</li>

    <li> I simply love thhis product. Having a head full of curls and trying to fight the humidity has just gotten a lot easier. This product works great. It is not being sold in any store within a 60 mile radius from where I live ( I know this bc I checked) and I had to go online. Thank goodness they had it. Again...I love love love this product!</li>
    <li> This is the only product my daughter can use on her very curly hair.  It tames her frizz and leaves lovely spiral curls.</li>
    <li> This would rate much better in my books ( probably a 4 ) if the gel would actually come out in a spray form instead of stream as it does. Whoever purchases this should not spray onto hair as described in the directions, but spray onto hands first and scrunch. By following the directions you&#x27;ll likely end up looking like the fellow from Twisted Sister did, back in the 80&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed when i got this and saw that the spray gel comes out in a stream instead of an all over mist. It still helps my hair curl is i spray it in my hand then scrunch it, but its definitely not what i expected</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the first time.It&#x27;s better than gel.ıt made my curls looking better.the value is also  good.</li>

    <li> Love this product. It is better than there new product that had olive oil in it and maked my curls lay flat.  This product keeps my curls nice and bouncy.</li>
    <li> I usually use John Frieda dream curls but saw how many people liked this product. I can&#x27;t seem to find just the right amount for my long fine hair. The dream curls give my naturally wavy/curly hair bounce and definition. The spiral curl definition gel leaves my hair either looking oily or it&#x27;s sticky without much definition.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 6 months. I originally used John Freida Dream Curls for years and find that this product works much better. My curls still look nice the next day as well. The bottle claims 24 hours curls and it truly delivers. Definitely a must have for someone with hard to manage curly, frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> My husband likes to use this on his hair and our drug store stopped selling it.  As usual---I can find nearly everything on Amazon.  He was really happy to get a product he liked again and not have to look for something elsle.</li>
    <li> /for me and my hair this product is by far the best. Easy to manage with great results for my curls.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair that is very thick and course. I love this product, and it keeps my curls frizz-free without a greasy look.</li>

    <li> have to get use to it but it does what it says</li>
    <li> I used to buy this in the store but they no longer carry it around here. This is the only product I can find that gives just the right bounce to my curls. With just mousse alone my hair is wavy, but with a few sprays of this product on top of the mousse, it curls right up. I tried to go without, but not any more.</li>
    <li> I am not impressed with this product.  It left my hair stiff and sticky.  I will not be ordering this item any more.</li>
    <li> Made my hair too crunchy.  Only way it looked nice was if I had a pony.  I have long, naturally curly hair.</li>
    <li> good formula for curly hair, i am of mixed race, black and white and i have very curly hair from my moms irish roots. i work out daily so i needed someting i could spritz on wet hair to keep it in check after my showers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this works well to not let my hair get too frizzy. it doest really add shine or bounce or curl definition, but it works to not let it frizz out.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that has worked for my curly hair, it isn&#x27;t sticky and gives a natural look, I highly reccomend it</li>
    <li> This spray is lighter than the average spray gel, so gives you just enough hold without being super sticky or hard! It works really well with John Freida Dream Curls curl perfecting spray.</li>
    <li> I really like this product as it gives defined long lasting curls to curly or permed hair.  I can no longer find it in local stores.</li>
    <li> I was shocked as I really thought i had bought a softer conditioner to make the curls&lt;br /&gt; soft and curls as its natural but this was like a hairspray and should of gotten frizzeease i guess .</li>
    <li> SO glad to be able to get this on-line as I have traveled to every store I can think of that might carry it and found none. I&#x27;m old-school and like my crunchy hair gels!</li>
    <li> I love this spray!  I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 years and it has made my hair look wonderful!  I highly recommend this product for anyone with curly hair to tame frizz problems.  My curls look silky and not frizzy because of this spray.  Just simply spray it on your hair wet and scrunch away, it even works well during the day on dry hair.  I can&#x27;t live without John Frieda Frizz Ease products!  I also use the shampoo and conditioner with this product and it has changed my hair into something that looks great finally after years of searching!  The reason I started purchasing this here on amazon is because I was disappointed to find it is no longer being carried at any of my local walmart, target or even walgreeens, I hope this doesn&#x27;t mean its being discontinued!  The price amazon has it for here is a great price its actually cheaper than walmart so I will contiue to buy it here on amazon, it is a great buy!</li>
    <li> My only complaint (and it&#x27;s true of nearly all the hair products I buy, spending more on them than on food - natch) is gauging the amount I have to use to get the effect I need: too little, and it doesn&#x27;t work at all. Too much, or not evenly distributed -- oh boy. Then I have to use a product salad, diffuser, the whole 9 yards. All this to get a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look on my shampoo&#x27;d / conditioned / deep-conditioned / dab of leave-in-conditioned Medusa mass of hair. Directions always read &amp;#34;distribute evenly,&amp;#34; but if I did that with my hair au naturel, I&#x27;d get 2, maybe 3 uses out of the product. John F. needs to formulate a next level line for Truly Unruly Curly / Frizzy Hair That Needs Discipline, Dammit! Big Hair BAD, Pretty Soft Curls, GOOD. This is a good start, but there&#x27;s a lonnnnnnng way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally broke down &amp; got one of those chemical blow-dry deals where my stylist uses a flat iron AND a blow dryer with a round brush that felt like the boar was still angry about being used for heat styling. And it took FOREVER. So I&#x27;m happy to have found products that let me do what I do without all the sturm &amp; drang that comes with having the wonderful world of imperialism all in one head of hair -- anglo around the edges, tight waves towards the crown, then a Chaka Khan explosion as our journey ends in the back. When I need products, it&#x27;s not about &amp;#34;Black / Ethnic&amp;#34; vs &amp;#34;Everybody Else,&amp;#34; It&#x27;s finding what works for MY hair, and the journey continues ; )</li>
    <li> I like most  John Frieda products. This one is ply okay for me. It works okay, but tends to get stiff, &amp; clumpy in my hair . I try and just use a little bit &amp; that work better. I combine with my other curl gel too , and that works better.</li>
