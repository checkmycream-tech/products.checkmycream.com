      <li>excellent for the price</li>
      <li>Compare this review with mine of the excellent Braun 7526 shaver</li>
      <li>Excellent!</li>
      <li>But the Quality is very good.</li>
      <li>This item does what I wanted it to and was received as promised in very good condition.  </li>
      <li>Its very attractive for what it is, and the value seemed like a great deal to me.</li>
      <li>the trimmer does a great job and performs  great too!</li>
      <li>I am very glad to have this trimmer!    </li>
      <li>I found this product (Remington NEDH-2500) to be beyond my expectations; it is a great value for the price,</li>
      <li>After I tried my husband&#x27;s trimmer, I was impressed and went to buy my own.</li>
      <li>(a good thing</li>
      <li>Oh wait, 1 star because it has good battery life.</li>
      <li>I give this product a good recommendation.</li>
      <li>Nothing to say good about this product.</li>
      <li>Have been very pleased with this product and use it every morning as part of my shaving and preparation for the day</li>
      <li>Sure beats scissors!</li>
      <li>realised that it would have been cheaper in walmart as the shipping cost was greater than the cost of the item itself!</li>
      <li>dont buy this piece of junk,it has a nice design</li>
      <li>This is a nice and inexpensive trimmer.&lt;br</li>
      <li>For many years I owned Remington electric shavers made in USA (remember Victor Kiam who found them so good he bought the company).  </li>
      <li>I actually liked the trimmer.</li>
      <li>Of course get the kind with a rounded end.</li>
      <li>, looks great, built nicely, easy to keep clean and has 2 interchange-able heads.      </li>
      <li>and it was fine, but it came after a week!</li>
      <li>and it is safe to use in running water.</li>
      <li>Spend your money on a better one.</li>
      <li>FItting might be an issue once in a while</li>
      <li>Comes with a rotary head which i use most of the time, and a saw head like most</li>
      <li>Still using this one over the Mangroomer. :)</li>
      <li>Was ok when I purchased</li>
      <li>The linear head intended for ears and eyebrows wasn&#x27;t much better.  </li>
      <li>You get what you pay for, and it is so very true in this case.</li>
      <li>If you want to clip nose hairs under water buy this :-); otherwise get a Panasonic ER411 if they still are available.      </li>
      <li>Rotary head works fine.</li>
      <li>Looks fairly cheaply made.</li>
      <li>Well i think it funny to review this type of product for sure.  </li>
      <li>The manufacturers are saying this allows for more natural filtration, but I think its more of a liability issue on their part (someone probably got sued for a nicked nose).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean, just remove and rinse off the cutter head under hot running water and you&#x27;re done.</li>
      <li>This is not a very clincial instrument so not made of great material.</li>
      <li>Worth Full to buy this product.</li>
      <li>that many of the new designs are going this rout (even Panasonic).</li>
      <li>Well, the head is too short, the blade does not trim hair close, and the top comes off wayyy too easy.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had one for a few years and it still works great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never been nicked while using the trimmer and it works well with fresh or recharged batteries.</li>
      <li>I logged on to Amazon hoping this particular nose hair trimmer was still available.</li>
      <li>Lots of noise, looks cool, but doesn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
      <li>With the Wahl you can pull the plastic piece with the blades out and make sure it&#x27;s actually clean and then dry it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d be willing to bet</li>
      <li>Seems pretty unsanitary to me.</li>
      <li>but overall I am satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>Believe me, I was super gentle with it as I paid way too much for it.</li>
      <li>Simple put this is a good solidly designed product.</li>
      <li>What I like about this is it is very easy to use and is still fairly sharp after 3 years of use.</li>
      <li>Cheap, doesn&#x27;t work, piece of junk and a waste of money no matter how cheap it is.</li>
      <li>However when I try to put linear head, 3 out of 5 times it doesnt fit properly and so it doesn&#x27;t start when it is turned on.</li>
      <li>It does absolutely nothing.  </li>
      <li>Because I paid so much, I kept trying to use it.</li>
      <li>But it does the job of trimming my unwanted hair very well.</li>
      <li>I figured how much difference could there be between this and my husband&#x27;s Wahl?   </li>
      <li>when I first tried it, I thought it must have some sort of packaging to prevent the blades from working when new out of the box.  </li>
      <li>The only saving grace is the feature that it can be cleaned by running under cold or warm running water (as is the case with my surprisingly good Panasonic wet/dry face shaver).  </li>
      <li>This nose hair trimmer worked fine for a few months, but now I put a fresh battery in and it will not even turn on.  </li>
      <li>After reaming your nostril for a couple minutes, you might be lucky enough for one or two hairs to get stuck in the blades, causing you to wince as you rip them out.</li>
      <li>They are very cheaply made and only last a short time, before #1 just stopped working and #2</li>
      <li>;)  so those of us with deep removal issues can  </li>
      <li>Sorry, I don&#x27;t know for sure the model # of the Wahl; but in looking on Amazon, it closely resembles the Wahl 5545-400 3 in 1 which is only a dollar more.  </li>
      <li>I thought I would splurge on a new trimmer since my old Panasonic was dying.  </li>
      <li>The package includes the trimmer, ear hair cutter head and a clear cutter cap.</li>
      <li>WOW.</li>
      <li>far, far away.</li>
      <li>In disgust I sprayed aerosol electric shaver cleaner on the old unit and to my delight the Panasonic started working again.  </li>
      <li>This was a gift to replace my old Panasonic ER411 nose hair trimmer that stopped working.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for something that had the flat trimmer specifically and found this at a decent price.  </li>
      <li>I have gone through 2 of them already with very light usage, a black narrow one and a silver one just like this one.</li>
      <li>I gave it one star instead of zero because it offers a 30 day money back guarentee and can be returned to the point of purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>The sideburn trimmer on my very old electric razor does a MUCH better job, sad to say.</li>
      <li>While I realize the market is driving some of these design decisions and Remington is no different than any other budget nose hair trimmer, it was a bit of a shock to find that the switch is even more cheaply designed to fail rapidly than the budget nose hair trimmer I bought previously (Remington NE-1).  </li>

<li> : cheap plastic switch broke off (it will not reattach back on to the unit) making it useless.</li>
<li> The trimmer has a single switch that slides on/off with only one speed.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s trimming capabilites are non-existent and it goes without saying that I expected it to last longer</li>
<li> a few years ago to replace my last American made Remington XLR3000 when it finally gave out.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m curious about how long it will last.</li>
<li> I have replaced the battery once in last two years and haven&#x27;t had any other issue.</li>
<li> I only used them once or twice a month, handled them very gently, never dropped them.</li>
<li> It uses a single AA cell battery.</li>
<li> I only use it for trimming nose hair, so I can&#x27;t compare it against other brands or rate it for any uses other than that purpose.</li>
<li> At least with the NE-1, I was able to repair the switch with a piece of sheet brass when it failed.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s a dollar well spent.</li>
<li> Then the heads were very loose, and now the on/off switch just FELL APART.</li>
<li> only minor objection is that one of the heads it comes with is a little short if you know what i mean</li>
<li> Plus you can&#x27;t pull the pieces apart to clean it; you&#x27;re supposed to \\&quot;brush or blow hair from the cutting unit\\&quot; or you can \\&quot;hold the unit&#x27;s head under the faucet\\&quot;.</li>
<li> Save your money and buy regular small cuticle scissors.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t comment on the other head that&#x27;s included since I didn&#x27;t use it.    </li>
<li> The bottom of this product is too hard to open and close (where the battery goes).</li>
<li> The device has lasted a long time, hasn&#x27;t needed sharpening (but then again, I don&#x27;t have lots of thick hair)</li>
<li> I am extremely disappointed because Remington usually makes fine products.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a waste of time, plastic, and your time.</li>
<li> My last trimmer, made by Braun broke after 4 years, bought this to replace it and was amazed by how poor it is.  </li>
<li> I bought my son a different nose hair trimmer for Christmas 2013, with 4-5 star rating, and it&#x27;s already broken.</li>
<li> The trimmer simply did not work and, after three months, it&#x27;s broken beyond repair.</li>

    <li> While I realize the market is driving some of these design decisions and Remington is no different than any other budget nose hair trimmer, it was a bit of a shock to find that the switch is even more cheaply designed to fail rapidly than the budget nose hair trimmer I bought previously (Remington NE-1).  At least with the NE-1, I was able to repair the switch with a piece of sheet brass when it failed.  This new trimmer&#x27;s switch is designed to fail and be hard to repair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Device was broken when I opened it up from the annoying blister pack.  I should have shopped around more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap, disposable crap guaranteed to need replacing way too soon and fill up land fills.</li>
    <li> This item does not work.  It does absolutely nothing.  I bought one and then was sent a second one. Neither one works.  It was a gift and I felt so bad that I gave someone a gift that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This nose hair trimmer worked fine for a few months, but now I put a fresh battery in and it will not even turn on.  I kept trying the switch and it worked sporatically, clearly the switch is broken or motor has failed.  Spend your money on a better one.</li>
    <li> Worth Full to buy this product. I dont comment on price. But the Quality is very good.</li>
    <li> Cheap, doesn&#x27;t work, piece of junk and a waste of money no matter how cheap it is.</li>
    <li> After I tried my husband&#x27;s trimmer, I was impressed and went to buy my own. The Remington was the only brand at the store.  I figured how much difference could there be between this and my husband&#x27;s Wahl?   Well, the head is too short, the blade does not trim hair close, and the top comes off wayyy too easy.  Plus you can&#x27;t pull the pieces apart to clean it; you&#x27;re supposed to \\&quot;brush or blow hair from the cutting unit\\&quot; or you can \\&quot;hold the unit&#x27;s head under the faucet\\&quot;. Seems pretty unsanitary to me. With the Wahl you can pull the plastic piece with the blades out and make sure it&#x27;s actually clean and then dry it (a good thing if you agree the combo of moisture and nose/ear residue is an icky recipe for bacteria). I can&#x27;t comment on the other head that&#x27;s included since I didn&#x27;t use it.    Sorry, I don&#x27;t know for sure the model # of the Wahl; but in looking on Amazon, it closely resembles the Wahl 5545-400 3 in 1 which is only a dollar more.  I&#x27;d be willing to bet it&#x27;s a dollar well spent.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these through Amazon. It runs on a battery that lasts about 3 ear trimmings. It always clogs up.....Junk Junk Junk...save your money and buy a re-chargeable trimmer!</li>
    <li> What I like about this is it is very easy to use and is still fairly sharp after 3 years of use. I have only changed the batteries once and it is safe to use in running water. Overall it is a very solid product.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to warn you all, DO NOT buy a Remington nose hair trimmer. You will be sorry. I have gone through 2 of them already with very light usage, a black narrow one and a silver one just like this one. They are very cheaply made and only last a short time, before #1 just stopped working and #2: cheap plastic switch broke off (it will not reattach back on to the unit) making it useless. Only 1 year warranty &amp; they break shortly after that. I only used them once or twice a month, handled them very gently, never dropped them.</li>
    <li> Junk...first it wouldnt go on after sitting awhile. Then the heads were very loose, and now the on/off switch just FELL APART. Remington should be ashamed of putting their name on it.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for, and it is so very true in this case. It&#x27;s a waste of time, plastic, and your time.</li>
    <li> This trimmer comes with two heads...upper part is removable. However when I try to put linear head, 3 out of 5 times it doesnt fit properly and so it doesn&#x27;t start when it is turned on. Rotary head works fine.</li>
    <li> I bought this and it was fine, but it came after a week! &lt;br /&gt;I realised that it would have been cheaper in walmart as the shipping cost was greater than the cost of the item itself!</li>
    <li> Nothing to say good about this product. Save your money and buy regular small cuticle scissors. Of course get the kind with a rounded end. This product does not work. It is cute, comes with another trimmer type and both are useless.</li>
    <li> WOW. Remington, you sell us a trimmer that doesn&#x27;t trim.  what a scam?  What a waste of time and money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for some time.  I was looking for something that had the flat trimmer specifically and found this at a decent price.  The device has lasted a long time, hasn&#x27;t needed sharpening (but then again, I don&#x27;t have lots of thick hair), looks great, built nicely, easy to keep clean and has 2 interchange-able heads.      I am very glad to have this trimmer!    Long-live Amazon for no taxes in California!</li>
    <li> dont buy this piece of junk,it has a nice design but it doesnt work at all,i  threw it in garbage</li>
    <li> This item does what I wanted it to and was received as promised in very good condition.  I give this product a good recommendation.</li>
    <li> The attachement is little delicate and flimsy.  FItting might be an issue once in a while but overall I am satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I thought I would splurge on a new trimmer since my old Panasonic was dying.  This thing does not work.  when I first tried it, I thought it must have some sort of packaging to prevent the blades from working when new out of the box.  I looked inside the head and the blades were spinning.  I don&#x27;t know what the deal is, but it DOES NOT WORK.    Save you money.</li>
    <li> I found this product (Remington NEDH-2500) to be beyond my expectations; it is a great value for the price,</li>
    <li> When it arrived, it arrived with an exploded battery in the package and battery acid all over everything.  Had to throw it out.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Why is there no option for zero stars?    Do your sanity a favor and just go buy the manual twist trimmer by Groom Mate. The Remington model trims nothing. After reaming your nostril for a couple minutes, you might be lucky enough for one or two hairs to get stuck in the blades, causing you to wince as you rip them out. You probably won&#x27;t notice the pain though as you are trying to recover from the intense urge to sneeze from the trimmer&#x27;s vibration, and the unpleasant machine-shop smell that sticks in your nose for hours.   Oh wait, 1 star because it has good battery life.</li>
    <li> How I wish I had read the reviews here before buying. The trimmer simply did not work and, after three months, it&#x27;s broken beyond repair. Believe me, I was super gentle with it as I paid way too much for it. Because I paid so much, I kept trying to use it. I adjusted it, switched the heads out, etc., but it never, ever worked correctly. The sideburn trimmer on my very old electric razor does a MUCH better job, sad to say. It&#x27;s trimming capabilites are non-existent and it goes without saying that I expected it to last longer than three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay far, far away. I am extremely disappointed because Remington usually makes fine products. They struck-out with this one.</li>
    <li> This product just doesn&#x27;t cut my nose hair as close as the Panasonic it replaced. If I could remember the model of the Panasonic, I would mention it in this review. I hope I can find the manual for the Panasonic so I can get another one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Beware that many of the new designs are going this rout (even Panasonic). The manufacturers are saying this allows for more natural filtration, but I think its more of a liability issue on their part (someone probably got sued for a nicked nose). I just won&#x27;t buy their products anymore if they&#x27;re going to design them for marginal performance.</li>
    <li> This product did not cut any nose hair at all.  I am not exaggerating to say NONE.  I also bought a conair one and it was equally useless.  I gave it one star instead of zero because it offers a 30 day money back guarentee and can be returned to the point of purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also you can not use rechargable batteries in this unit only alkaline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no directions to this unit.  Under directions it only gives information on how to install a battery.</li>
    <li> the trimmer does a great job and performs  great too! recieved  from vendor quite sooner than stated. Excellent!</li>
    <li> This is not a very clincial instrument so not made of great material. But it does the job of trimming my unwanted hair very well. I have replaced the battery once in last two years and haven&#x27;t had any other issue.</li>
    <li> Have been very pleased with this product and use it every morning as part of my shaving and preparation for the day</li>
    <li> I purchased my Remington NEDH-2500 Titanium Personal Trimmer at Walgreen&#x27;s and have used it for almost two years. I&#x27;ve had no problem with it trimming nose hair sufficiently, but it is a little difficult to cut those just inside the base of the nose without doing some simple contortionist feats. This is the only trimmer of this sort I&#x27;ve ever used. I only use it for trimming nose hair, so I can&#x27;t compare it against other brands or rate it for any uses other than that purpose. I&#x27;ve never been nicked while using the trimmer and it works well with fresh or recharged batteries. It uses a single AA cell battery. The trimmer has a single switch that slides on/off with only one speed. It&#x27;s easy to clean, just remove and rinse off the cutter head under hot running water and you&#x27;re done. The package includes the trimmer, ear hair cutter head and a clear cutter cap. This is a nice and inexpensive trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please rate this review if you found it helpful.</li>
    <li> I should have gotten one of these years ago! Sure beats scissors! Looks fairly cheaply made. I&#x27;m curious about how long it will last.</li>
    <li> Was ok when I purchased but I have moved along to Norelco</li>
    <li> Still using this one over the Mangroomer. :)</li>
    <li> My last trimmer, made by Braun broke after 4 years, bought this to replace it and was amazed by how poor it is.  It hardly cuts anything.  Lots of noise, looks cool, but doesn&#x27;t really work.  At all.  Wierd.  Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
    <li> I actually liked the trimmer. Did what it&#x27;s suppose to, UNTIL, the bottom broke off when turning it on one time. I think I will check out a different one next time. Can get costly if it keeps breaking.</li>
    <li> The bottom of this product is too hard to open and close (where the battery goes).</li>
    <li> I logged on to Amazon hoping this particular nose hair trimmer was still available. I&#x27;ve had one for a few years and it still works great. I bought my son a different nose hair trimmer for Christmas 2013, with 4-5 star rating, and it&#x27;s already broken. Should have gone with this one from the start. I must have gotten the one in ten that works? Don&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;m going to buy another for my son.</li>
    <li> excellent for the price</li>
    <li> This product works... but, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as I would like.. It doesn&#x27;t seem to contour, but it does get the job done!</li>
    <li> This was a gift to replace my old Panasonic ER411 nose hair trimmer that stopped working.  I found the rotary head to be almost totally ineffective at cutting nose hairs.  The linear head intended for ears and eyebrows wasn&#x27;t much better.  The only saving grace is the feature that it can be cleaned by running under cold or warm running water (as is the case with my surprisingly good Panasonic wet/dry face shaver).  In disgust I sprayed aerosol electric shaver cleaner on the old unit and to my delight the Panasonic started working again.  If you want to clip nose hairs under water buy this :-); otherwise get a Panasonic ER411 if they still are available.      For many years I owned Remington electric shavers made in USA (remember Victor Kiam who found them so good he bought the company).  Unfortunately the Chinese Remington products are inferior.  Compare this review with mine of the excellent Braun 7526 shaver I bought from [...] a few years ago to replace my last American made Remington XLR3000 when it finally gave out.</li>
    <li> Well i think it funny to review this type of product for sure.  Simple put this is a good solidly designed product. Its very attractive for what it is, and the value seemed like a great deal to me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My only minor objection is that one of the heads it comes with is a little short if you know what i mean ;)  so those of us with deep removal issues can  still sorta have a farm going on. However changing the head solves that problem.   Comes with a rotary head which i use most of the time, and a saw head like most i have seen. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
