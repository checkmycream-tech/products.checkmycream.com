<li> The spray that I used previously was much denser and required less to achieve the desired result.  </li>
<li> I thought this was the same thing, but this weighs down my hair and makes it look wet instead of shiny.  </li>
<li> the other for a friend.</li>
<li> The only problem is it is hard to find.  </li>
<li> I typically apply it by spraying two squirts in my hands, rubbing them together, then combing my fingers through my hair from the ears on down.</li>
<li> I would recommend this product to any men who would like to style their hair without a stiff messy end product.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to find, always sold out.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to find lately</li>
<li> It does not weigh hair down, does not look &amp;#34;oily,&amp;#34; and does not smell bad.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately the manufacturer discountinued this product which was really dumb</li>
<li> I sorry I ordered 3 bottles as I won&#x27;t use it.</li>

    <li> This product is by far the best product for frizzy hair, over processed hair, pourus hair...Unfortunately the manufacturer discountinued this product which was really dumb and now you cant find it anywhere</li>
    <li> I received the shipment of Pure Shine Shine Luminator and noticed that the product formula seems different than the previous bottle purchased through a local drug store.  The spray that I used previously was much denser and required less to achieve the desired result.  I like the way the current product makes my hair shine and the manageability it provides.  It just requires more.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff leaves my hair soft and shiney.</li>
    <li> I had used this product previously and loved it, but could no longer find it.  Thanks&lt;br /&gt;to Amazon, I now have a great shine again.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND CANT BUY IT ANY WHERE AROUND MY HOME SO ITS A BLESSING TO BE ABLE TO ORDER IT FROM AMAZON USE IT ALL THE TIME MAKES MY HAIR LOOK REAL SHINY JUST LIKE ITS CALLED. THANKS</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years. I ALWAYS get compliments on how beautiful my hair is, even tho I am over 65 !!!  I have told many of my friends about this product.  Love, Love, Love this hair shine.</li>
    <li> Used to buy this in a store, and then couldn&#x27;t find it.  It gives a very glossy shine to hair by spraying lightly on hair after styling.  It is the only gloss that doesn&#x27;t make my hair more oily.  I love the sheen of my hair after applying just a light spray.</li>
    <li> Do Not, I repeat, Do not spray this on the crown of your head! If you do, you&#x27;ll look like greasy mcgreaserson. I typically apply it by spraying two squirts in my hands, rubbing them together, then combing my fingers through my hair from the ears on down. It really helps with frizz, puffiness, and humidity.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  The only problem is it is hard to find.  Walmart sold product and then suddenly they did not sell product anymore.  I was so happy to find it on Amazon.  This product weeks wonders without being greasy.  I would recommend this product for all types of hair.</li>
    <li> I have tried other brands (some for much more money), and I have found this shine spray to be the very best!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and prompt delivery</li>
    <li> This is excellent!  It does not weigh hair down, does not look &amp;#34;oily,&amp;#34; and does not smell bad.  It is exactly what I wanted.  Thank you for this great product!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Seems to be the same as the old product just different packaging.  Gives hair super shine!! Teri</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find, always sold out.  I have long hair and it gives me the best shine of any product I&#x27;ve ever used...and I&#x27;m 66!</li>
    <li> So so. Not as good as hask.</li>
