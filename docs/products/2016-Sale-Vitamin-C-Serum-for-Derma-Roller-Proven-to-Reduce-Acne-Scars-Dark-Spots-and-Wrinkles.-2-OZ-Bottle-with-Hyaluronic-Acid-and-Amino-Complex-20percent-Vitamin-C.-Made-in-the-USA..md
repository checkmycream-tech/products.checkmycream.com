<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great service and nice product!</li>
    <li> After using for 10 days I can definitely see a difference and feel a difference on my face. Will definitely be re-ordering. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive skin and am prone to breakouts so I was rather skeptical about this product at first. That said, I use only a few drops a day and this product and noticed a very big difference already with some dark spots as well as wrinkles. Great product!</li>
    <li> WOW this blew my mind. I’m skeptical about trying new products but when I heard that a vitamin c serum can really dial back the years for my skin I had to try it. After only few weeks of use I have seen changes already. I’m a happy buyer.</li>
    <li> As good or better than all of the other Vitamin C serums I have used before, and at a much better price.  Very pleased with the product.  Not at all oily.</li>
    <li> I started using this vitamin c serum about a month ago and I really like the results. It gives my skin a glow and it made my skin look and feel cleaner. I get a lot of comments on my skin now this is really worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum maybe 3 times a week. I&#x27;m not old so I wasn&#x27;t looking for much other than clear skin and a glow. The glow comes if I use regularly. My pimples from hormones come and go as they please this serum doesn&#x27;t work for that. It&#x27;s watery, and a side note, I&#x27;ve noticed thicker eyebrows since I&#x27;ve started using it. Probably from the vitamin e.</li>
    <li> I love the vitamin c serum. Absorbs very quickly my skin feels more hydrated and soft. Will buy again, bought others to compare. Works just as well for a better price.</li>
    <li> I had really high hopes for this, only to have it cause breakouts! Eek! I&#x27;m not sure what is it about this particular Vitamin C Serum that is causing that problem. I have tried a couple other brands and have had them clear up &amp; keep away breakouts. I still think that it&#x27;s a great product, it just didn&#x27;t work out for me like I had hoped it would. I received this product for free in return for an honest review.</li>
    <li> This is a great vitamin C serum! It comes with the hyaluronic acid and amino complex which is something that I look for since not all of the vitamin C serums has the combination in them. I especially love the texture of this serum and the fact that it has no added scent to it. It is very easy to apply as well as easy to add to your daily skin routine. Also, the bottle is quite large for the price compared to other brands.</li>
    <li> Great Vitamin C Serum, absorbs quickly, doesnt leave you feeling greasy, and you can see the results. The combination of the Vitamin C and the Hyaluronic acid, work great at battling the elements that are aging your face.</li>
    <li> I was surprised when I got this bottle in the mail. Normally when asked to review something you get a small 1oz bottle. This company sent a nice sized 2oz bottle for review. It comes shipped with a twist off cap that you can replace with a glass dropper. I love the sound of the glass dropper against the glass bottle. it reminds me of science class or the science toy kits. I always enjoyed pretending to be a scientist and this sound reminds me of this every time I use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you read the product description they tell you to not waste your money on expensive products, facelifts, lasers or chemical peels because Vitamin C is proven to stimulate collagen and reverse the effects of environmental damage. Get compliments on your skin and look younger. Vitamin C gets rid of fine lines, wrinkles and brightens your skin. Vitamin C serum is very potent an a high quality product that is proven to help you look and feel younger.  Well its true. I do get compliments on my skin now. I do feel like my skin looks and feels younger. It feels much more smooth and even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for three weeks and I have seen amazing results. I use this product on a nice clean face. After I have a nice clean face, I apply a drop to each cheek, forehead and chin. A very little of this product goes a long way. It is super easy to smooth into your skin. I say smooth into your skin because that is exactly how it feels. It just blends into your skin so smooth. It dries nicely. I feel like my skin absorbs this fast. After this is dry I then apply my daily moisturizer over it. This helps to seal in the moisture and hydrate it better. I tried it the first time without any moisturizer and my face felt really tight and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The list of ingredients on this bottle take up one whole side of the bottle. The label says the ingredients are 20% Vitamin C, 98% Natural and 72% Organic. If you read the list of ingredients it does seem like those percentages are correct. you can definitely pronounce almost every single ingredient listed too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in trying out this product you can find it on Amazon for 19.78. You will be saving 60.21 by purchasing off Amazon. You can also check out their website Simply Vitamin C Serum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.correct. you can definitely pronounce almost every single ingredient listed too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in trying out this product you can find it on Amazon for 19.78.

    <li> It didn&#x27;t do much to make darkening spot on my face fade.</li>
    <li> A big thanks to Simply Vitamin C Serum for sending me this product to test out and do a review for my blog, GlamRiver!  I have been trying a few different Vitamin C Serums, each one a little different and have been loving them all and I am so excited to add this one to my list of favs!  This serum is fantastic because it also has Hyaluronic Acid Serum, Amino Complex AND Vitamin E and all this helps with my aging, wrinkles and it has even helped smooth out my skin!  I also loved that you get a full 2 oz bottle!  This another great product to add to my skin care routine!</li>
    <li> Sorry I took so long to write a review for this FABULOUS product. Where do I began. Well, first of all my skin look amazing after first time use following my derma-roller. It is helping to keep pimples to a minimal and it&#x27;s working amazing for my hyper-pigmentation. As a woman of color, hyper-pigmentation is our worst enemy, but this product has become my combatant against it.!!! Oh and a little goes a loooooong way. I only squeeze the nozzle once, and it&#x27;s enough to cover my entire face. Hands down my must have in my beauty regime.</li>
    <li> Very happy! Second time I&#x27;ve purchased this serum, lasted almost 4 months! Small amount goes a long way, very lightweight, absorbs right into the skin. Pair with your favorite retinol cream. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> ordered the vitamin C serum and got it within a week. I have heard a lot about it and can&#x27;t wait to use it. The customer service was just awesome and the product was well packaged....very pleased!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see much difference.  But that is my experience with similar products.  I keep using them and I still have skin at age 75, so they must do some good.</li>
    <li> I had bought another vitamin c serum with Retinol and I thought it would be better WRONG!!!! It had great reviews and even bought some for my mom. I didn&#x27;t like it and it kind of made my face hot in some areas, also it did not absorb into my skin like this serum did.&lt;br /&gt;I really love this one, it goes on so nice and leaves my face feeling nice and smooth. I ended up giving the other one to my daughter so now I have to wait until the 1st to buy this one; but I won&#x27;t use anything else!!! Also I use bio- oil plus a  mosterizer and a toner, not in that order,LOL</li>
    <li> Great serum! Leaves skin feeling smooth. Will buy again. I do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple weeks. What an improvement. I would recommend this product and plan on buying more before the price goes up.</li>
    <li> I have been using Premium Vitamin C Serum with Hyaluronic Acid Serum and Amino Complex for the last few weeks.  This product comes in a 2 oz. bottle, which is 1 oz. more than most facial serums.  You remove the product from the bottle with an eye dropper in the lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply the Vitamin C serum to clean, dry skin on your face and neck both in the morning and the evening.  Because the product dries quickly, it needs to be applied swiftly.  It leaves nothing behind and your skin feels smooth.  You made or may not need to use a moisturizer after using the Vitamin C serum.  I do use moisturizer afterwards even though I have combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Vitamin C serum, my face feels  great and looks fabulous.  The fine lines (assuming I have them ;) ), are smoother and hardly noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Premium Vitamin C Serum is made in the USA and is not tested on animals.</li>
    <li> Better than most hyaluronic vitamin c serums, I have used many!!&lt;br /&gt;I use this directly after I derma needle face neck and backs of hands, it then goes directly into the epidermis !!&lt;br /&gt;I just turned 66, I do not have one wrinkle !!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was expecting a little tingling sensation when applying, but did not happen.  I&#x27;ve been applying for a few days and so far I have not seen any skin glow or any improvement.  Not sure if I would buy again. I&#x27;m dissapointed.</li>
    <li> It works well for me.  Will be ordering more</li>
    <li> Satisfied ! Good texture. Good results.</li>
    <li> This is a very similar formula to some other serums I have tried but this one is a 2 ounce bottle where most of the others are a 1 ounce bottle, for about the same price so you get twice as much.  It not only has vitamin C but also has vitamin E and hyaluronic acid in it, where some others are just vitamin C and some fillers.  It is a clear, thin, odorless, watery consistency that is easy to apply and soaks right in.  I use my normal moisturizer on top of it and it seems to make it work better.  My skin feels much more moisturized and hydrated.  Overall, this is a very complete serum and does wonders for your skin.  My skin is smoother and softer.  It seems to have plumped up my skin so my lines and wrinkles are not so noticeable and it looks a lot better.  I received a complimentary product in exchange for a fair and honest review.</li>
