    <li> Not exactly the size I was expecting but it works. By size I refer to the depth of the item; it&#x27;s pretty thin compared to the original. However I&#x27;ve not seen any noticeable problem from this fact. I did however use 2 of them simultaneously.</li>

    <li> I wish it had directions.  No idea which end goes where.</li>
    <li> This is not the item that you need, it is paper thin and not even close to OEM specs for what the filter is suppose to do.  Move on to the next item, especially an item that will give a side picture of the item.  Not even worth the money I paid for it.  I keep wondering why this is not fraud since it is so very far from the OEM specs.  If there was a way to give a negative rating, this item would of received a negative rating.</li>
