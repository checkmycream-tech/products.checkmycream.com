      <li>Wonderful product.  </li>

      <li>This product works great to moisturize my face without making it feel greasy.  </li>
      <li>Great price</li>
      <li>But for what I use it for, it works great.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a good thing to know.</li>
      <li>and I feel good using it.</li>
      <li>But over all it&#x27;s a good lotion and doesn&#x27;t make me breakout like some sunscreens.</li>
      <li>A good lightweight, summer moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I used a really good eye shadow primer and withing 10 minutes, my eye shadow was creased and smeared and worn off my eye lids.</li>
      <li>Soaks in nicely, smells good, and doesn&#x27;t bother my hyper-sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Love this product!  </li>
      <li>I usually love Burt&#x27;s Bees, but this has me breaking out all over!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I love this day lotion!  </li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>I love this moisturizer!</li>
      <li>Is a light consistency that seems to have good coverage and pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, it does give my face a nice Radiant glow.  </li>
      <li>It seems to be a nice product</li>
      <li>Nice consistancy.  </li>
      <li>Love love love thiS product!!</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and am prone to breakouts and Burt&#x27;s Bees is just perfect, I don&#x27;t have any problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>As with most SPF formulas, they break my face out.  </li>
      <li>the lotion I would love to return</li>
      <li>I also bought the Radiance Eye Cream and that seems to be better</li>
      <li>Love the product.  </li>
      <li>Love this, have been using for years.  </li>
      <li>No nasty side effects!</li>
      <li>It smells okay</li>
      <li>Moisturized OK, maybe best for dry skin.</li>
      <li>I love this lotion, it goes on light and smooth and smells nice.  </li>
      <li>This product does everything it says it will - gives you super soft skin, is lightweight, and smells amazing!!  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, and I use Burts Bees products, and it works great at keeping my complexion balanced.</li>
      <li>The first use of the brand, its taste is very refreshing, and moisturizing.</li>
      <li>They have cleared up significantly and I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a very soft pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, has a pleasant smell and offers some SPF protection.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is light and pleasant and this lotion doesn&#x27;t cause my eyes to sting or run as most stronger facial sun creams do.  </li>
      <li>I bought this, thinking that adding SPF would only be another benefit to an already great cream.</li>
      <li>This lotion does not feel smooth on my face after putting it on.  </li>
      <li>Light coverage.</li>
      <li>I loved the idea of this day lotion being all natural, but have found that putting it under my makeup leaves my skin looking oily during the day.</li>
      <li>I love the whole Radiance line!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the normal (SPF free) version of the Radiance Day Cream.</li>
      <li>This lotions is perfect for SPF 7 which I normally use for golf with a partial coverage hat.</li>
      <li>Love it glad to see it back on Amazon we noticed that BB&#x27;s quit producing it for a while</li>
      <li>It also smells great, without the sour smell.</li>
      <li>but I can tell you from someone who rarely gets breakouts and after using this I cannot recommend this.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been chasing over in all our areas of my family to more natural products but this has been the one area I&#x27;ve held onto still using my neutrogena products for face wash and moisturizers.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t sunbathe and keep my face shaded if I have to be in strong sunshine for an extended time, but the SPF 7 is adequate for me for regular daytime use on sunny days.</li>
      <li>I hardly ever give anything five stars but this stuff is great.</li>
      <li>With my Clinique I always have soft, smooth skin.  </li>
      <li>The first lasted 4-5 months since you don&#x27;t need to use a lot at a time.</li>
      <li>On top of that, it often goes on clumpy and leaves white streaks drying on the face that flake off.</li>
      <li>This did too at first.  </li>
      <li>I loved it the first few days I had it!  </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>but of course it&#x27;s really to soon to tell if it is going to work for the undereye area...</li>
      <li>Also, it is light enough that my face does not feel greasy.</li>
      <li>It really has made her skin &#x27;glow&#x27;.</li>
      <li>So far the sensitive skin moisturizer does better for making my fine libes less visible.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Smells nice as well, but not sure I will buy it again because it&#x27;s too watery.</li>
      <li>The eye cream smells even more sour.</li>
      <li>Also, it made my cheeks super red like a rash.  </li>
      <li>Makes me really sad because otherwise it&#x27;s a great product.  </li>
      <li>Overall I recommend it to people who have more dry than oily.</li>
      <li>It is far thinner than the other Radiance Day cream, and one had to use far more.</li>
      <li>I am not typically prone to breakouts unless I eat too much table sugar.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had a hard time finding a good lotion with an SPF, because they&#x27;re usually so thick and/or greasy, but this one is light and non-greasy.  </li>
      <li>but so far I&#x27;m not liking it!  </li>
      <li>screen&amp;#34; like and makes my face slightly more oily than other facial lotions without SPF in them.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out to get more even though the bottle seems small.</li>
      <li>Delivers just the right amount of moisture for my dry skin, while allowing me to put on powder make-up over it</li>
      <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees sensitive skin daily moisturizer, but wanted something with a little spf, so bought</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve not broken out like that ever even when going through puberty and might I add I&#x27;m a 34 year old who doesn&#x27;t drink pop and washes daily.  </li>
      <li>I have to wait about 10 min for it to completely absorb before applying makeup.  </li>
      <li>I like the fact that it is 98.2% natural and no animal testing.</li>
      <li>Also, I&#x27;m sensitive to a lot of chemicals, but can tolerate this product.  </li>
      <li>My skin is naturally oily, so if you&#x27;re like me, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
      <li>I gave it to my daughter who has skin opposite of me, and she seems to really like it.</li>
      <li>but I cannot recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>It makes my face soft, and keeps my skin from drying out.</li>
      <li>To top it off, there is a strange sour smell to the scent of this product that I don&#x27;t care for.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like Burt&#x27;s Bees for keeping their products fairly natural and free of harsh chemicals and that it comes in a glass container, not knowing what chemicals may leach from plastics.</li>
      <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s and use several of their baby products for my kiddos sensitive skin, chapsticks and several other items but can&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
      <li>Thanks but no thanks.</li>
      <li>It smells worse, I broke out more, and it didn&#x27;t help my dry skin nor rosacea at all the way the normal Radiance does.</li>
      <li>I do not use this as my every day facial lotion, only on days where I&#x27;ll be exposed to the sun for long periods of time, as this tends to feel and smell very &amp;</li>

<li> but the lotion goes on a little tacky.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It smells okay but the lotion goes on a little tacky.  I have to wait about 10 min for it to completely absorb before applying makeup.  It does NOT make my face look &amp;#34;radiant&amp;#34; as advertised. Probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Irritated the heck out of my skin,  but that&#x27;s not the seller&#x27;s fault.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for about 4 days but so far I&#x27;m not liking it!  It feels sticky going on and it starts flaking as it dries!  I also bought the Radiance Eye Cream and that seems to be better but of course it&#x27;s really to soon to tell if it is going to work for the undereye area...the lotion I would love to return but I threw away the box it came in because although I have not been totally inpressed with other face lotions I have never had one that flaked on me....that&#x27;s my opinion of Radiance!</li>
    <li> I loved the idea of this day lotion being all natural, but have found that putting it under my makeup leaves my skin looking oily during the day. I now tend to wear it during the day if I&#x27;m off from work so avoid the oily look.</li>
    <li> The first use of the brand, its taste is very refreshing, and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the normal (SPF free) version of the Radiance Day Cream. I bought this, thinking that adding SPF would only be another benefit to an already great cream. I often use SPF moisturizer, but I simply hated this one. It is far thinner than the other Radiance Day cream, and one had to use far more. On top of that, it often goes on clumpy and leaves white streaks drying on the face that flake off. It smells worse, I broke out more, and it didn&#x27;t help my dry skin nor rosacea at all the way the normal Radiance does. If, like me, you&#x27;re curious if they&#x27;re similar, please do yourself a favor and stick with the other one.</li>
    <li> Love this! Soaks in nicely, smells good, and doesn&#x27;t bother my hyper-sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Love this, have been using for years.  Great price</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it is 98.2% natural and no animal testing. It seems to be a nice product and I feel good using it. It makes my face soft, and keeps my skin from drying out.</li>
    <li> My only issue is that it&#x27;s a bit sticky, like regular sunscreen. But over all it&#x27;s a good lotion and doesn&#x27;t make me breakout like some sunscreens.</li>
    <li> Reviewed by wife. It works well. Does not make me break out. Not oily or greasy. I can&#x27;t stand the floral smell.</li>
    <li> A good lightweight, summer moisturizer. Smells nice as well, but not sure I will buy it again because it&#x27;s too watery.</li>
    <li> Love the product.  Nice consistancy.  Not greasy.  Absorbs well.</li>
    <li> I have to use a product to help me with my acne-prone skin, which can really dry out my skin.  This product works great to moisturize my face without making it feel greasy.  Would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I hate writing bad reviews but I cannot recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve been chasing over in all our areas of my family to more natural products but this has been the one area I&#x27;ve held onto still using my neutrogena products for face wash and moisturizers.  I broke down and finally tried this. After only two uses my face broke our like I was a teenager going through puberty.  I&#x27;ve not broken out like that ever even when going through puberty and might I add I&#x27;m a 34 year old who doesn&#x27;t drink pop and washes daily.  Also, it made my cheeks super red like a rash.  I don&#x27;t know.  Not everyone&#x27;s skin is the same but I can tell you from someone who rarely gets breakouts and after using this I cannot recommend this.  Uber frustrating since this was like $9 and I only got two uses.  I love Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s and use several of their baby products for my kiddos sensitive skin, chapsticks and several other items but can&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> Love love love thiS product!! This makes my skin feel so supple even as a person who fights with acne problems. I thought since I&#x27;m AA that I don&#x27;t need sunscreen until I read that was the reason for my dark marks. They have cleared up significantly and I love this stuff. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot so I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out to get more even though the bottle seems small. I hardly ever give anything five stars but this stuff is great.</li>
    <li> I recently started a multi-step skincare regimen. I had no problems before with this lotion, but after I switched, I realized that it&#x27;s really not great if you have any serum, etc. underneath it. If you layer at all, it will pill up and look bad. Not a situation that applies to everyone, but it&#x27;s a good thing to know.</li>
    <li> I like this lotion however it&#x27;s too greasy for me. Overall I recommend it to people who have more dry than oily. I am not sure if I read the information correctly or not, but it&#x27;s definitely not for my skin. I gave it to my daughter who has skin opposite of me, and she seems to really like it. It really has made her skin &#x27;glow&#x27;.</li>
    <li> This left my  skin feeling &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; and a little oily looking. Moisturized OK, maybe best for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin break out.  Into the garbage.</li>
    <li> This product does everything it says it will - gives you super soft skin, is lightweight, and smells amazing!!  I loved it the first few days I had it!  I am not typically prone to breakouts unless I eat too much table sugar.  What I didn&#x27;t realize was that BB&#x27;s products are made with sucrose which is table sugar.  Therefore, it caused me to break out.  Makes me really sad because otherwise it&#x27;s a great product.  If you have any sensitivity to sugar, don&#x27;t use this product.</li>
    <li> I have Rosacea and the prescription that the Dermatologist&#x27;s gives me, does not help. This is the only cream that helps the redness and burning.</li>
    <li> I do not use this as my every day facial lotion, only on days where I&#x27;ll be exposed to the sun for long periods of time, as this tends to feel and smell very &amp;#34;sun screen&amp;#34; like and makes my face slightly more oily than other facial lotions without SPF in them. But for what I use it for, it works great.</li>
    <li> Very good, happy shopping experience, I am very satisfied, give 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I usually love Burt&#x27;s Bees, but this has me breaking out all over! My skin is naturally oily, so if you&#x27;re like me, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> As with most SPF formulas, they break my face out.  This did too at first.  But I needed sun screen. So I kept using it. Now my face is use to it. You have to rub it in well otherwise it looks like you have a white coating on you face.Otherwise, it does give my face a nice Radiant glow.  So I am very happy.</li>
    <li> Not worth the hype this product left my skin feeling dry and I always looked as if someone slap me across the face with some white powder. Thanks but no thanks.</li>
    <li> A little thick feeling on my skin but maybe that&#x27;s the point</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and am prone to breakouts and Burt&#x27;s Bees is just perfect, I don&#x27;t have any problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very soft pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  No nasty side effects!</li>
    <li> I use a variety of day and night creams but I like this as a daytime moisturizer for days when I will be outdoors.  I don&#x27;t sunbathe and keep my face shaded if I have to be in strong sunshine for an extended time, but the SPF 7 is adequate for me for regular daytime use on sunny days. The fragrance is light and pleasant and this lotion doesn&#x27;t cause my eyes to sting or run as most stronger facial sun creams do.  I like Burt&#x27;s Bees for keeping their products fairly natural and free of harsh chemicals and that it comes in a glass container, not knowing what chemicals may leach from plastics.</li>
    <li> The fragrance was overpowering. :(</li>
    <li> Love this product!  It gives you such a radiant glow!  Light coverage. No white face just glow!</li>
    <li> Is a light consistency that seems to have good coverage and pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Delivers just the right amount of moisture for my dry skin, while allowing me to put on powder make-up over it 30 min or so later.  Also, I&#x27;m sensitive to a lot of chemicals, but can tolerate this product.  Sun protection too - I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees sensitive skin daily moisturizer, but wanted something with a little spf, so bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product went on tacky and greasy and stayed that way. It never soaked into my skin. I even waited 30 minutes before applying makeup. I used a really good eye shadow primer and withing 10 minutes, my eye shadow was creased and smeared and worn off my eye lids. My face remained tacky to the touch all day. When rubbing it on, it balls up or something. I get these little gray balls of something, don&#x27;t  know if its the sunscreen or mica component. . I was so relieved to wash it off. To top it off, there is a strange sour smell to the scent of this product that I don&#x27;t care for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the eye cream and the night moisturizer. The night cream is smoother, less greasy and doesn&#x27;t feel tacky at all. It also smells great, without the sour smell. The eye cream is even tackier than the daily moisturizer and just slides around on my skin like gel or something. The eye cream smells even more sour. So far the sensitive skin moisturizer does better for making my fine libes less visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am mid 30s with oily skin.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for something with SPF to replace my Clinique moisturizer with no SPF.  This lotion does not feel smooth on my face after putting it on.  With my Clinique I always have soft, smooth skin.  I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Too sticky! Wanted something for face, but cant use this on face! waste of money :(</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer! I have sensitive skin, and I use Burts Bees products, and it works great at keeping my complexion balanced. At one point the SPF was higher than 7, and when they changed it I was highly disappointed, SPF is a must in my routine! But I keep using it because it still works. I also mix in about 3 drops of the radiance serum, and it helped my complexion even further!</li>
    <li> This product does what I was looking for.  It&#x27;s lightweight, has a pleasant smell and offers some SPF protection.  It has kept my skin moisturized thought the winter and now into the summer. I&#x27;m on my second bottle. The first lasted 4-5 months since you don&#x27;t need to use a lot at a time.</li>
    <li> I love this day lotion!  I&#x27;ve always had a hard time finding a good lotion with an SPF, because they&#x27;re usually so thick and/or greasy, but this one is light and non-greasy.  I love the whole Radiance line!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, it goes on light and smooth and smells nice.  I tend to break out from lotions, but no problems with this one.  Also, it is light enough that my face does not feel greasy.</li>
    <li> Love it glad to see it back on Amazon we noticed that BB&#x27;s quit producing it for a while This lotions is perfect for SPF 7 which I normally use for golf with a partial coverage hat.</li>
