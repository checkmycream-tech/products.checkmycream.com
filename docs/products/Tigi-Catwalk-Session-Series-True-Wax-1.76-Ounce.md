      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>Keeps your hair looking good all day and the best thing is it does not make your hair hard.</li>
      <li>Plus, the wax causes a high sheen, if you don&#x27;t like that kind of look.</li>
      <li>I like how effective it is at getting that slightly gelled look while still having a good hold.</li>
      <li>First of all I really fell in love with the fragrance!</li>

      <li>Great for short, dry hair - adds nice shine and texture but not greasy</li>
      <li>The scent is pleasant and it holds my hair in place over the course of the day and doesn&#x27;t feel crunchy, doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp or flake.</li>
      <li>This product is good for those that want to part their hair and make your hair look clean and sharp.</li>
      <li>I will go for a more natural solution next time, though.</li>
      <li>Was looking for a little more hold after checking out the videos from YouTube.</li>
      <li>If you were to brush through your hair with your fingers it would be as soft as your hair just out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:</li>
      <li>Second it works great on my heavy thick hair.</li>
      <li>Though most of the ingredients are petroleum based and potentially irritating to the scalp, the product works.</li>

<li> Though most of the ingredients are petroleum based and potentially irritating to the scalp, the product works.</li>
<li> After my hair went from wavy and thick for the better part of my youth, teens and twenties... to almost spiral curly in about 5 years, I needed serious help because it was an afro.</li>
<li> It just makes your hair really waxy and oily looking and is hard to wash off.  </li>
<li> My hair was around five inches long when I used this, and it was tear-inducing to apply.</li>
<li> But be careful and use just a tiny bit.</li>
<li> and then I towel dry it, add then add the Sea Salt Spray.</li>
<li> Just  wash and dry your hands agressively with a towel after applying this pruduct.&lt;br</li>
<li> put in some of this wax throughout my wet hair</li>
<li> This is a decent product, hold-wise, but the wax is hard, and not particularly easy to run through hair.</li>
<li> Shiny and separated pieces, a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> My hairdresser told me that I shouldn&#x27;t wash my hair but once a week or every two weeks (not every other day)....and to use this product along with the TIGI Catwalk Session Series Sea Salt Spray.</li>
<li> After putting the product on its a little hard to wash off your hands.</li>
<li> Frizz was my nightmare and it is no more.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to get out of your hair but it will hold it together</li>
<li> Curly hair people, these two products you won&#x27;t be disappointed with.</li>

    <li> Love this product.  AAA transaction!</li>
    <li> This stuff tames even the most wavy/curly hair! It&#x27;s hard to get out of your hair but it will hold it together</li>
    <li> It just makes your hair really waxy and oily looking and is hard to wash off.  If you are trying to spike your hair; this might not be the product for you.  I would suggest using Mandom if you want to spike your hair.  This product is good for those that want to part their hair and make your hair look clean and sharp.</li>
    <li> The best smelling hair product ever!  Great shine and separation!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Gives you hold and shine and smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair look like Patrick Bateman from American Psycho. Nice hold and does not harden up. Softens in heat though.</li>
    <li> I like how effective it is at getting that slightly gelled look while still having a good hold. Though most of the ingredients are petroleum based and potentially irritating to the scalp, the product works. I will go for a more natural solution next time, though.</li>
    <li> nice if you like shinny hair but does not hold hair in place</li>
    <li> Was looking for a little more hold after checking out the videos from YouTube. Good product nevertheless. Good price too.</li>
    <li> Works marvels for my short color treated hair. Shiny and separated pieces, a little goes a long way. I have this on subscription order and its a great price on Amazon!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:9826177d136e3621bb28105c36e1c1eb]] This is a review for the kbkrisp YouTube channel (to view in HD watch there)</li>
    <li> Keeps your hair looking good all day and the best thing is it does not make your hair hard. If you were to brush through your hair with your fingers it would be as soft as your hair just out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: After putting the product on its a little hard to wash off your hands. Just  wash and dry your hands agressively with a towel after applying this pruduct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product my wife even uses it</li>
    <li> Good product would definitely buy again</li>
    <li> Great for short, dry hair - adds nice shine and texture but not greasy</li>
    <li> This is what my hairdresser always puts in my hair when I go to the salon. The scent is pleasant and it holds my hair in place over the course of the day and doesn&#x27;t feel crunchy, doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp or flake. The salons charge $30 or so for this product, but you can get the same product at a steep discount from Amazon.</li>
    <li> After my hair went from wavy and thick for the better part of my youth, teens and twenties... to almost spiral curly in about 5 years, I needed serious help because it was an afro. My hairdresser told me that I shouldn&#x27;t wash my hair but once a week or every two weeks (not every other day)....and to use this product along with the TIGI Catwalk Session Series Sea Salt Spray. I brush out and rinse my hair w/H20 daily...put in some of this wax throughout my wet hair and then I towel dry it, add then add the Sea Salt Spray. My hair has never been better. I get compliments constantly. Curly hair people, these two products you won&#x27;t be disappointed with. Frizz was my nightmare and it is no more.</li>
    <li> Really great product. I found out about this item after I went to Tony n Guy hair salon and the hair dresser used it on my hair. First of all I really fell in love with the fragrance! I had multiple occasions of compliment on that from ladies. Second it works great on my heavy thick hair. I keep buying this item. I recommend. I wonder if they make perfume out of this scent?</li>
    <li> Love this product.  But be careful and use just a tiny bit.</li>
    <li> This is a decent product, hold-wise, but the wax is hard, and not particularly easy to run through hair. My hair was around five inches long when I used this, and it was tear-inducing to apply. Plus, the wax causes a high sheen, if you don&#x27;t like that kind of look.</li>
