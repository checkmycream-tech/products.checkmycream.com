      <li>It was a good starter.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a good starter set.</li>
      <li>good results with polish and stamper.</li>
      <li>I had bought a set (diffrent brand) years ago at those mall carts with 5 plates, the rubber stamp, scraper and 3 nail polishes that worked so good</li>
      <li>Use the q-tip to wipe the scraper edge clean (cleaning the scraper every time helps with wiping off the nail polish perfectly everytime).</li>
      <li>Came in quickly and works wonderfully!</li>
      <li>I tried the cheaper versions of this and decided to give this konad a try, I am very pleased with it</li>

      <li>Easy to use!</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t use the metal scraper because it will scratch the plates, but a gift card or old credit will work perfect, better than the scraper.</li>
      <li>Konad&#x27;s stamp plate, scraper and stamp works great but comes with a higher price tag.</li>
      <li>Will be buying more of these plates</li>
      <li>My daughter will love it.</li>
      <li>but I bought this kit since I need a stamper and wanted to keep some of the Konad nail polish (to compare it with my regular nail polish) and they ALL work great!</li>
      <li>I love it of course</li>
      <li>any more -about</li>
      <li>was ok nail  </li>
      <li>Takes some practice to do, but my daughters love it.</li>
      <li>but this one works make sure you get Konadnail</li>
      <li>and a top coat to preserve the nail art (I used Finger Paints and it didn&#x27;t smear the art, amazing).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>so you should buy more</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll like it</li>
      <li>even more once I get those.</li>
      <li>Have tried to use it many times and still will not stamp.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll be buying more discs and polish to go with it.</li>
      <li>but all n all  love this Lil kit..</li>
      <li>cute patterns and easy to use, wish have more color optional</li>
      <li>Some designs worked better than others but none of them were as easy as the directions looked to be.</li>
      <li>So about 3 - 4 stamps per finger takes about 30 - 60 minutes to do a full set of some very nice pretty nails.</li>
      <li>I have used the konad polish and stamper/scraper with other plates and it works perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Although I bought this for my mom, I have my own and they are super to use and so much fun!</li>
      <li>Scraping off the excess polish was easy</li>
      <li>, I wish it was as easy as it looks.</li>
      <li>Then very quickly press or roll the stamper onto it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The nail stamping set works fine.</li>
      <li>They work fine.</li>
      <li>Product came quickly in mail!</li>
      <li>Three different colored nail polish is a great choice for starters.</li>
      <li>just right Love the scraper.</li>
      <li>I would do this for hours with all my friends if it really worked !!!</li>
      <li>The shipping was really fast and everything is very easy to use.</li>
      <li>The plates work fine, the polish is good, however, I personally didn&#x27;t care for that stamper...</li>
      <li>Roll or press stamper onto lint roller to clean any remaining stamp nail polish</li>
      <li>Trying to clean the stamper is like trying to peel off a stubborn sticker.</li>
      <li>Clean any excess nail polish off the skin around the nail with a q-tip dipped in nail polish remover.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>/&gt;To clean the stamper use a lint roller.</li>
      <li>Wipe clean with a q-tip and acetone.&lt;br /&gt;- Q-tip dip into acetone, swipe plate pattern to clean, use cotton ball to wipe dry.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>Life hack - use lint roller to clean</li>
      <li>She really liles them and said she got more in this pack</li>
      <li>Kit works good with regular polish.</li>
      <li>I need to practice before I can give a true review.</li>
      <li>This item is really cool.</li>
      <li>Cool kit</li>
      <li>I even bought a separate black Konad special polish and that worked beautifully.</li>
      <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a great set</li>
      <li>Shipped quick.</li>
      <li>Konad brand polish is good for a first start, but most experienced manicurists/nail artists will quickly realize that many more easily available and less expensive polishes will stamp just as well.</li>
      <li>Super fun and receive lots of compliments.  </li>
      <li>once I figured out how to get a nice clear image all my nails got done consistently well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think this could be fun for all ages if you get the hang of it.</li>
      <li>But you can see it on the applicator before you stamp a partial image onto your nail, so that&#x27;s good.</li>
      <li>Loved the quality of this compared to the other ones I bought.</li>
      <li>Then about an hour to get the scraping motion just right,  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t seem to find such a good deal, easy to use, and that actually does what is intended.</li>
      <li>It cleans the stamper perfectly, and the lint roller isn&#x27;t damaged by the nail polish (the polish coat is so thin it doesn&#x27;t get through the first layer of sticky lint paper).</li>
      <li>Spend a few more dollars and get a better kit.</li>
      <li>When I got it and tried it, I was surprised how easy it was.</li>
      <li>I also tested out my own regular pink nail polish (Finger Paints brand, Wannabe Warhol color) and it worked ok, but I definitely had to try a few times to get the perfect pattern to transfer onto the stamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good for little girls.  </li>
      <li>That absolutely was not the case!</li>
      <li>It scratches the plates the first time it&#x27;s used.</li>
      <li>Now, I don&#x27;t have to pay extra to get a flower on my toes when I get a pedicure!  :-)</li>
      <li>I cleaned the stamp thoroughly and made sure to use enough polish.</li>
      <li>At first it wasn&#x27;t picking up when I tried</li>
      <li>Overall, I love this product.</li>
      <li>Came just as packaged- not a HUGE fan of the images on the included plates, but the nail polish works good</li>
      <li>I have since purchased other Konad Special Polishes elsewhere that work much better.</li>
      <li>Use an old plastic card, like an old library, old credit, old hotel check in key-card, or save a gift card with $0.00 balance so you can just permanently store it in your manicure kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polish is great.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The reason I gave this 4 stars was because the 2 discs were just not as nice as some of the other Konad discs.</li>
      <li>Overall satisfied with the purchase since it was a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Fresh Q-tip in acetone, swipe plate pattern to clean, use other end of q-tip in acetone to wipe clean again</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this set one month ago and I still practiced,  I love it of course I will recommend and as scraper,  I used a credit card 💳.</li>
    <li> was ok nail  Polish was small so you should buy more but this one works make sure you get Konadnail</li>
    <li> This item is really cool. Takes some practice to do, but my daughters love it.</li>
    <li> good results with polish and stamper.</li>
    <li> It did not work,mi don&#x27;t know if the nail polish was too watery the stamp design never transferred to the nails.</li>
    <li> My scrapper could never get all the polish off clean enough.  Waste of time and money.  At least I tried.</li>
    <li> Good for little girls.  I&#x27;m currently using it to do My seven yr old daughters nails</li>
    <li> Loved the quality of this compared to the other ones I bought. Konad&#x27;s stamp plate, scraper and stamp works great but comes with a higher price tag. Overall satisfied with the purchase since it was a reasonable price. Shipping was fast and arrive early.</li>
    <li> The 3 polishes in the kit have an expiration date of 2/2014 - I just bought this for my daughter at Christmas. Polish is clumpy and unusable. Kit works good with regular polish.</li>
    <li> I bought this Konad starter set when I decided to get into stamping manicure art. It was relatively easy to learn how to fill, scrape, and stamp the design, but I might have chosen a different set if I had known that the rubber that picks up the stamping polish was very close to the red of the stamping polish. The bright red single-ended stamper makes it difficult to stamp with any shade of red, pink, or orange and many shades of purple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Konad brand polish is good for a first start, but most experienced manicurists/nail artists will quickly realize that many more easily available and less expensive polishes will stamp just as well. However, it is a good idea to start with the dedicated product, so I would recommend starting your stamping adventure with Konad plates at least. This set comes with two great plates that include a variety of all-occasion designs. You won&#x27;t run out of options for a while, although you will probably want to branch out a bit.</li>
    <li> Remember to rough the surface of the stamper up a bit with a fine emery board so that it will pick the polish up well, and press hard enough that the stamper picks up ALL of the polish from the design on the plate.</li>
    <li> purchased as a gift, so cannot review based on personal experience.  Receipient said it works great and is fun to use.</li>
    <li> When I first got this I was ready to return it. I had watched a lot of youtube videos and read a lot about stamping. My polish seemed thinner than what I had seen from others. I used the metal scraper and was afraid to scratch my plates, so I wasn&#x27;t pressing as hard as I should have. I was just smearing the polish and not getting it all off the plate. I got a sturdy old debit card, and pressed down alot harder than I thought I should have to, and it worked beautifully. I&#x27;ve never had hate turn to love of a product so fast. Just keep playing with it if you have problems. I hope it works out for you!!</li>
    <li> I had a terrible time getting some stamps on my nails, I watched youtube.com for directions but nothing work . I am not returning it because I will loose more on shipping.</li>
    <li> Although I bought this for my mom, I have my own and they are super to use and so much fun!</li>
    <li> Saw this product at the L.A. County Fair (Fall 2013), but didn&#x27;t purchase there because of price.  Purchased on Amazon and absolutely love this product!  Super fun and receive lots of compliments.  Now, I don&#x27;t have to pay extra to get a flower on my toes when I get a pedicure!  :-)</li>
    <li> Ok, so this is the 1st Konad that I&#x27;ve used and it definitely meets my expectations, I&#x27;ve owned 3 other brands of stampers and none of them compare to the Konad. At first it wasn&#x27;t picking up when I tried but then I found that filing the rubber stamp a little helps it to pick up better, I don&#x27;t use the metal scraper because it will scratch the plates, but a gift card or old credit will work perfect, better than the scraper. As far as the image plates go, they are pretty plain but I ordered a big pack of 25 of them in it and they have the larger(whole nail) image on them so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll like it even more once I get those.</li>
    <li> A terrible waste! I am not the most crafty individual but after watching YouTube videos showing how simple this was to use, I thought it would be a cinch! That absolutely was not the case! I wanted to put a little something fancy on my toes so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to pay for pedicures. I had no such luck. The pattern would not stay on the rubber stamp, let alone my nail. I cleaned the stamp thoroughly and made sure to use enough polish. It didn&#x27;t work. I have a large ziloc bag where I keep all of my nail supplies. There it went and there it stays.</li>
    <li> Nail polishes a bit small but for the package just right Love the scraper. Stamper a bit small to handle.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time and was as described</li>
    <li> I bought this because someone I knew used them. I need to practice before I can give a true review.</li>
    <li> THis was not what I expected it was thick and hard to work with I tried thinning it and it still didnt cover and was very sticky.</li>
    <li> I love this kit, its very easy to stamp even as a beginner!</li>
    <li> Reading the reviews I was worried that it would be super hard to use this product. When I got it and tried it, I was surprised how easy it was. It took a couple of tries to get the technique down, but once I figured out how to get a nice clear image all my nails got done consistently well.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re having trouble, don&#x27;t try to go over the polish with the stamper more than once, that just smears the image. Put one end of the stamper down, and roll it over the polish once firmly. Repeat that motion on your finger to get a clear image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave this 4 stars was because the 2 discs were just not as nice as some of the other Konad discs. As someone who is older than 13, there are a lot of images that I can&#x27;t really use. The stamper also happens to be a very similar color to the red polish. So it&#x27;s difficult to place a red image exactly where you want it on your nail since you can&#x27;t really distinguish it from the stamper. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great set and I&#x27;ll be buying more discs and polish to go with it.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me.  I don&#x27;t know whether or not I&#x27;m still doing something wrong, but I just can&#x27;t get the stamper to pick up the image. It almost seems as though the design on the plate is not etched deep enough, because the image doesn&#x27;t show up clearly after it&#x27;s had the nail polish applied to it, &amp; has had the excess taken off with the scraper.  Also, the scraper seems to take off pretty much all the polish so that there&#x27;s nothing left for  the stamper to pick up.  All in all,  very disappointing.  I&#x27;ll take any tips anyone can give me so that it&#x27;s not a complete waste of my money.</li>
    <li> Delivered in time. The product works.</li>
    <li> Ordered these for the wife after seeing them at a home show for almost triple the price.  She really liles them and said she got more in this pack then they were offering at the show.</li>
    <li> Frustrated with this product. Have tried to use it many times and still will not stamp. I&#x27;ve tried the suggestion to file the rubber stamp and still not successful. I had bought a set (diffrent brand) years ago at those mall carts with 5 plates, the rubber stamp, scraper and 3 nail polishes that worked so good but I gave them away and now that I got back into nail art I can&#x27;t seem to find such a good deal, easy to use, and that actually does what is intended. The scraper scratches the plates. One of the reviews suggested using old credit cards to scrape instead.. But Again, still not doing what it&#x27;s intended to do and you have to find alternative ways to make it work for you. Sadly for me I haven&#x27;t been successful. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> The idea is a good one, but so far I have been unable to transfer an image to my nails.  I think I&#x27;m going to have to get me a teenager to show me how to do it.</li>
    <li> It is not as simple as it look .&lt;br /&gt;I tried it a few times and put it away.</li>
    <li> I tried the cheaper versions of this and decided to give this konad a try, I am very pleased with it and i&#x27;m happy I gave it a chance.</li>
    <li> The nail stamping set works fine. I have primarily used the white polish and may need to purchase a second bottle of it. I have not yet used the red or blue. The scrapping tool does scratch the silver plates, however it does not damage them beyond appearance. They work fine. Overall, it is a nice little product.</li>
    <li> This set to me was a waste of money. It did not work well. Spend a few more dollars and get a better kit.</li>
    <li> Came just as packaged- not a HUGE fan of the images on the included plates, but the nail polish works good and it&#x27;s a good starter set.</li>
    <li> Product came quickly in mail! Easy to use! Will be buying more of these plates</li>
    <li> Cool kit but it takes a few tries to get designs working correctly. Other reviews were helpful b/c we knew practice would be needed to get it right. Like salon does, only a whole lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> The stamps in my kit were great. The polish, not so much. The blue worked fine but the red and white were both too thick and a bit lumpy. I suspect I was sold an old kit. I have since purchased other Konad Special Polishes elsewhere that work much better.</li>
    <li> I think this could be fun for all ages if you get the hang of it. I had a terrible time transferring the polish on the plates to my nails. Some designs worked better than others but none of them were as easy as the directions looked to be. Scraping off the excess polish was easy but once you pick up the design not all of it would come every time and you would have to try again or start over with another design idea to accommodate your mistake, I wish it was as easy as it looks. I would do this for hours with all my friends if it really worked !!! I bought it as a present for a friend in a nursing home but she couldn&#x27;t do it and gave it back to me to try. Good luck everyone.</li>
    <li> I bought the cheeky plates (since they&#x27;re EXTREMELY cheaper than Konad) but I bought this kit since I need a stamper and wanted to keep some of the Konad nail polish (to compare it with my regular nail polish) and they ALL work great! The shipping was really fast and everything is very easy to use. The polish was smaller than I expected, even though it says MINI nail polish. I just didn&#x27;t think it was THAT small. Overall, I love this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my niece and after watching a few youtube videos and some trial and error she loves  the set.</li>
    <li> Great product. Stamp is soft so nail paint comes over in stamp nicely. Scraper is gud as well. I&#x27;ll recommend thid kit to frds.</li>
    <li> Came in quickly and works wonderfully! I will be buying more Konad products!</li>
    <li> Very unimpressed for this to be a Konad product. This item was used once and put away, and most likely will never be brought back out again.</li>
    <li> Great  product. Great seller! Thank you!</li>
    <li> It was a good starter.  The plates work fine, the polish is good, however, I personally didn&#x27;t care for that stamper...may just be me though.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get the polish to adhere to the stamper until I read on some obscure blog that you need to file the stamper with a medium file (100 grit) to rough up the stamp so the nail polish has a not-perfectly-smooth-surface to attach to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scraper is a piece of crap. It scratches the plates the first time it&#x27;s used. Use an old plastic card, like an old library, old credit, old hotel check in key-card, or save a gift card with $0.00 balance so you can just permanently store it in your manicure kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polish is great. I even bought a separate black Konad special polish and that worked beautifully. I also tested out my own regular pink nail polish (Finger Paints brand, Wannabe Warhol color) and it worked ok, but I definitely had to try a few times to get the perfect pattern to transfer onto the stamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plates aren&#x27;t etched deep enough on some patterns, like the stars, to be able to pick up the polish from them either. I was able to use the flower on the outside, but not the flower pattern that is in the center. The little patterns aren&#x27;t etched enough. I have 4 other plates from 2 other companies that are about to be shipped and hopefully those will work better. (If I remember, I will update this review with the usability of those plates.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To clean the stamper use a lint roller. Works wonderfully. It cleans the stamper perfectly, and the lint roller isn&#x27;t damaged by the nail polish (the polish coat is so thin it doesn&#x27;t get through the first layer of sticky lint paper). Trying to clean the stamper is like trying to peel off a stubborn sticker. Life hack - use lint roller to clean stamper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me about 2 hours to figure out how to get the polish to stick to the stamper. Then about an hour to get the scraping motion just right,  need speed and moderate pressure. Then once I got the hang of it and a routine (below) going it took 3 minutes down to 1 minute to do each stamp. So about 3 - 4 stamps per finger takes about 30 - 60 minutes to do a full set of some very nice pretty nails. So patience and determination is a virtue with this art!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine:&lt;br /&gt;- Get your work station set up with polish(s), plate(s), scraper, stamper, dish of acetone, dish of nail polish remover, q-tips, cotton balls or cosmetic sponges, paper towel to scrape onto, and whatever else you use. Have your nails prepped and ready with the base coat fully dried (at least use a clear base coat).&lt;br /&gt;- File stamper with 100 grit file. Wipe clean with a q-tip and acetone.&lt;br /&gt;- Q-tip dip into acetone, swipe plate pattern to clean, use cotton ball to wipe dry.&lt;br /&gt;- Nail polish onto plate, don&#x27;t need too much.&lt;br /&gt;- Quickly swipe excess nail polish off with moderate pressure at a 45 - 30 degree angle. Then very quickly press or roll the stamper onto it.&lt;br /&gt;- Align with the nail (only take less than 8 seconds to this or the polish will dry, suggest asap) and roll or press it onto nail.&lt;br /&gt;- Roll or press stamper onto lint roller to clean any remaining stamp nail polish off.&lt;br /&gt;- Fresh Q-tip in acetone, swipe plate pattern to clean, use other end of q-tip in acetone to wipe clean again (this double clean really helped with getting a full pattern every time), then use a cotton ball to wipe dry. Use the q-tip to wipe the scraper edge clean (cleaning the scraper every time helps with wiping off the nail polish perfectly everytime). Throw away.&lt;br /&gt;- Repeat at Nail polish onto plate step until nails are fully stamped. Don&#x27;t need to file the stamper every time, just when the polish starts to not stick to it any more -about every 10 - 20 stamps.&lt;br /&gt;- Clean any excess nail polish off the skin around the nail with a q-tip dipped in nail polish remover.&lt;br /&gt;- Apply any other nail art, (dots, glitter, etc.) and a top coat to preserve the nail art (I used Finger Paints and it didn&#x27;t smear the art, amazing).&lt;br /&gt;- Marvel and be proud of the wonderful art you&#x27;ve created!</li>
    <li> Did not work I was not satisfied waste money and time</li>
    <li> This kit allows for you to try stamping, but you do need something to hold the plates.  I have used the konad polish and stamper/scraper with other plates and it works perfectly.  Would definitely recommend it as a starter kit</li>
    <li> Have not used this item myself.  Was ordered for grand daughter and she was delighted with it at the time.</li>
    <li> Shipped quick. My daughter will love it.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that this set can be a little tricky to use and sometimes you just have to do a &amp;#34;do over&amp;#34; before applying the design to your nail. But you can see it on the applicator before you stamp a partial image onto your nail, so that&#x27;s good. If the image is bad on the applicator, you just have to re-do it. My eleven year old is really into nails and she CANNOT do this by herself. You do need a (patient) adult.</li>
    <li> Works great with all nail polish :)</li>
    <li> Was way better than what I expected. .. best I&#x27;ve baught so far for stamping...  kool that it came with the polish....  too bad the polish bottles are tiny. ..  but all n all  love this Lil kit..</li>
    <li> Awesome kit, everything that you need is included. Three different colored nail polish is a great choice for starters. I love it!</li>
    <li> cute patterns and easy to use, wish have more color optional</li>
