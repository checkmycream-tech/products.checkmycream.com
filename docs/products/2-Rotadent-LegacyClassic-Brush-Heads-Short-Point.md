      <li>Dental hygiene is so important for me, that&#x27;s why I use Rotadent.</li>
      <li>Good product and I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
      <li>I was pretty sure I was ordering the correct brush heads.</li>
      <li>packaging was fine and it arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>Worth the price if you want to keep your teeth until you die!</li>
      <li>Still until I purchase one, I will continue to use the original model and order refills.</li>
      <li>Keeps my crowns and gum line clean.</li>
      <li>Keeps my teeth clean and controls plaque</li>
      <li>But, my teeth have never been so clean.</li>
      <li>It polishes my teeth and makes them feel so clean.  </li>
      <li>They also send you the Rotapoint plastic cleaners to really get the margins better than just water can.</li>
      <li>and they sure aren&#x27;t cheap and my Rotadent just keeps going and going just like new.</li>
      <li>I love to use my rotadent brush specially with the classic brush head,makes my teeth cleaner</li>
      <li>The rotodent and these short point brush heads have kept my teeth and gums healthy for many years.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easier buying them on-line than remembering to get an adequate supply when I go to the dentist for a check-up.</li>
      <li>They arrived quickly and were the items I ordered.</li>
      <li>These brushes came quickly and were just as advertised.</li>
      <li>these tips seemed to wear out quickly</li>
      <li>Quick delivery.</li>
      <li>Love my new brushes, I received them 2-3 days sooner than predicted.</li>
      <li>Heads work great, especially like the new color.</li>
      <li>The heads are fine, but the real kudos go to the Rotadent electronic unit itself.</li>
      <li>I first purchased it when I got some veneers and was worried about keeping them clean at the gum line.  </li>
      <li>The Rotadent replacement tips arrived earlier than expected and are perfect for our electric toothbrush!</li>
      <li>I use them with my Golden Retriever/</li>
      <li>I have used Rotodent brushes with much success.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
      <li>Her smile makes her the friendiliest dog on the planet/</li>
      <li>I have a 25% success rate with rotadent brush heads.</li>
      <li>So if you have the old power handle, you must make sure you are ordering the correct brush heads for said power handle.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>Bristles seem to flatten out much faster the originals and seem softer than the original brushs that came with brush.</li>
      <li>These replacement heads fit an older model, purchased it about 3 yrs ago.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>They really keep my teeth clean.  </li>
      <li>Then a new one has bristles that are extremely soft, kind of like brushing my teeth with a marshmallow.</li>
      <li>it was nice to see they have a label indicating the brushes were for the old model and not the new one.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They are identical to the one that came with the unit.  But you MUST know whuch unit you have and be very careful to order the exact heads made for that unit.</li>
    <li> I have been using this teeth clenaing method for years.  These replacement heads can be pricey.  These were priced competitively.</li>
    <li> Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I would recommend that you buy a different brand of toothbrush altogether.  I see very little difference in this unit and ones that less than $20 on the toothbrush isle in the supermarket.</li>
    <li> This did not fit my Rotadent. They must have made a new model since my original.</li>
    <li> I always use this product, is one of the best for me in the market</li>
    <li> Ordered mine from HB Supplies and these didn&#x27;t work with Rotadent One Step toothbrush. They fit, but when powered on doesn&#x27;t turn properly.</li>
    <li> these tips seemed to wear out quickly</li>
    <li> I have used this product before.  It works great for my needs.  Occasionally, the brush will come loose from the base and you just have to push it back on.  Not really a problem and it doesn&#x27;t happen often.  I would purchase again and recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love my electric toothbrush - have to keep the brushes in good working order.</li>
    <li> rotadent is a great way to keep your teeth and gums in perfect condition. I highly recomend this product to anyone wanting a great healthy smile</li>
    <li> Total satisfaction. The same as my last order. Surprised that the price seemingly keeps going up for these refill brushes since newer models have superseded the original roto dent brush.  Still until I purchase one, I will continue to use the original model and order refills.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Rotadent electric toothbrush since 1985 and I&#x27;m only on the second one.  It polishes my teeth and makes them feel so clean.  I don&#x27;t care what they say about rotary brushes compared to vibrating style brushes I love the Rotadent.  That being said, you do have to buy refills for the heads.  They are not cheap but they do last a long time so it&#x27;s worth it.  I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue these refills because that means another electric tooth brush and they sure aren&#x27;t cheap and my Rotadent just keeps going and going just like new.</li>
    <li> Work fine and am happy, Thanks</li>
    <li> This product came to me so fast I didn&#x27;t expect it for another week.  I have used the Rotadent Tooth Brush for 6 or 7 years and am very impressed with it&#x27;s cleaning power.  Used to be you could only buy replacements and accessories through the participating Dentist.  Thank Goodness we don&#x27;t have to do that anymore.  We can Amazon.com them and get them in 48 hours!  These replacement brushes are perfect.</li>
    <li> The rotodent and these short point brush heads have kept my teeth and gums healthy for many years. I first purchased it when I got some veneers and was worried about keeping them clean at the gum line.  Now when I go in for a cleaning, I have NO pain. My plaque has been reduced drastically.</li>
    <li> These brushes came quickly and were just as advertised. Good product and I will definitely be ordering more. This site offered a much better price than most and is much more in line with what the dentist charges if he carries them in his own office. Good value!</li>
    <li> Ordered for a family member, who is very happy with them.</li>
    <li> this was exactly what I expected and work just fine.  it was actually cheaper than ordering from the manufacturer due to the shipping savings.  I would give it a 5 but its a toothbrush.  packaging was fine and it arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> In order to use these brush heads you need to purchase a Rotadent electric toothbrush. I purchased mine through my dentist and it cost me about $100 ten years ago. It comes with a life-time guarantee so if the motor runs down like mine did a year ago they will send you a new one for free (but save all the paperwork!) There are several different brush heads--I prefer the short pointed one for getting between teeth. I switched dentists recently so now i must buy the brush heads on Amazon--they cost about the same.</li>
    <li> Package of two. One doesn&#x27;t work...the other makes s a loud clattering noise.</li>
    <li> Until recently, I would give the Classic Rotadent brush heads a 4 star review. They&#x27;ve always cleaned my teeth well since I&#x27;ve been using them for the past 4 or 5 years. However, the last brush heads I bought have been leaking a gray substance from the inside of the brush head, which is disturbing! I haven&#x27;t read any other reviews about this problem. I don&#x27;t leave the brush heads on my toothbrush base. I brush and then immediately remove the brush from the base. So I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s causing the gray substance to leak from the brush head. This has happened with two different brush heads now that I purchased from different sellers on Amazon. Maybe I need to contact Zila about it! I&#x27;d be interested to know if this has happened to anyone else.</li>
    <li> I have a rotadent and needed some replacements. I use it everyday. I need to buy a few more. They work well.</li>
    <li> They are so good I use them with my Golden Retriever/ Her smile makes her the friendiliest dog on the planet/</li>
    <li> This is one of the best toothbrushes ever, so I am a fan of this product.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This brush really gets in between teeth and is excellent at cleaning off tarter. I really love the Rotadent brush.  It has a small enough head so I can really get at my back teeth without gagging.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> These heads work great. This is the second time I have ordered from this supplier. Pleased with both purchases.</li>
    <li> I have been using Rotadent truth brush for about 15 years.  They are amazing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Rotadent for 10+ years now. Happy to have an easily available source to replace the heads inexpensively.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and have always been happy with it. As long as the handle holds up I&#x27;ll keep ordering them</li>
    <li> I like the longer point much better.  This style does not perform as well because it doesn&#x27;t seem to get in all areas.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s complicated trying to match refills to any electronic toothbrush since there are so many styles.  I called the manufacturer to make sure I was ordering the proper type and have had no problems with my Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Rotadent toothbrushes.  This is the only product to clean your teeth and under the gums also:  totally eliminating gum disease.  Throw all the others out.  You&#x27;ll thank me later.</li>
    <li> Nice pack for an nice price...not disappointed.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised.  These are the correct heads for the spin brush they made about 10 years ago; and that&#x27;s what I have.</li>
    <li> I love this brush head. Keeps my crowns and gum line clean. I am only 25 but use this for preventative reasons.</li>
    <li> I have purchased 3 brushes in the last 30 days.  The first one did not work?  The second worked  for 2 days and it quite too?  The third lasted for 5 days and it stopped.  The people that sell these brushes to the public should be ashamed of themselves.  My dentist stopped selling the rotadent products a long time ago because of complaints from his patients.  Poor quality products.</li>
    <li> Fits the classic toothbrush holder and the pointed end works good.  It gets inbetween all your teeth really well but the prices are a little high for these replacement brushes.</li>
    <li> Ordered these new heads so my daughter (10) can brush her teeth better with braces.  Her gums were inflamed due to poor brushing and within a few days of using the rotadent brush her gums are not as inflamed.  She can now floss without pain.</li>
    <li> I was sent the blue short tip for my classic rotadent and it did not work. I called Rotodent direct and they sent me the original black ones and they did work just fine</li>
    <li> Have used rodent for years. Only problem is that as time passes these tend to come off as you brush but no problems getting them back in place.</li>
    <li> I never thought I&#x27;d be paying $32 for tooth brushes.  But, my teeth have never been so clean.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy these!  They don&#x27;t work after 2-3 times!  Buy the real thing from Rotadent.  These are very poor imitations.</li>
    <li> These are replacement heads for my toothbrush.  They work great just like the originals I got from my dentist.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> It ws a simple process, nothing out of the ordinary.  it was nice to see they have a label indicating the brushes were for the old model and not the new one.</li>
    <li> These are of great quality.  In new packaging,  Identical to the brush heads I have with the old toothbrush.  Very happy with them.</li>
    <li> Rotadent is the best toothbrush.</li>
    <li> These heads didn&#x27;t seem to fit right on the Rotadent brush base, they squeaked, dragged, and vibrated rather than turning smoothly. I returned them.</li>
    <li> Love my rotadent toothbrush. Heads work great, especially like the new color. The bristles are blue instead if the boring black.</li>
    <li> I bought two brush heads and neither one worked. They didn&#x27;t spin. I put the old brush head back on and it spun fine.</li>
    <li> This brush has helped control gum disease and reduced the formation of plaque.  My dentist is very pleased. The rotation duplicates the dentist&#x27;s brush</li>
    <li> This was exactly what was portrayed. They were new Rot-a-dent brush heads.They arrived quickly and were the items I ordered. It did specify there were not for the Plus. I don&#x27;t remember if it said they were for the Classic model and they seemed a little tight, but better now.</li>
    <li> I have a 25% success rate with rotadent brush heads. Out of the four brush heads only one lasted the full three months I used it. Regarding the two that I bought here, the first lasted about a month and made a loud mechanical noise until it just stopped spinning. The second one lasted about 20 seconds into it&#x27;s first use before it stopped spinning.</li>
    <li> these dont work.. second time ive had problems with these!!</li>
    <li> Everything was great!</li>
    <li> The heads are fine, but the real kudos go to the Rotadent electronic unit itself. You can only purchase this from a dentist and not all dentists sell it. It is $150. It has a replacement and I don&#x27;t know what the features or price are of the replacement. Since using it my dentist has asked me to come once a year for cleanings instead of twice and it&#x27;s hard for him to tell (without looking up close) if the hygienist has cleaned my teeth yet. It is rechargeable and the battery lasts over 5 years and then you need to get a new unit. The charge lasts about 2 weeks if used normally every day. I&#x27;m on my second of the original design.</li>
    <li> I have the toothbrush and always order the brush tips from amazon. Two usually last me all year long. I usually also use my regular toothbrush, as well. The toothbrush and the tips are great on your teeth and your gums. I def give theses a 5 star.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this toothbrush several years ago for my gum challenges. The bristles are so very soft, like a paint brush, but clean so well. The brush unit holds a charge for weeks and lasts forever. When my first one finally wore out (wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore) they sent me a new one! I highly recommend. Worth the price if you want to keep your teeth until you die! I&#x27;m not a fan of dentures or implants!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost 10 years which has saved my gums and teeth from all problems.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I love using the rotadent brush, short point, because it cleanses in between your teeth very well and it&#x27;s also very gentle on your gums, massaging them at the same time.  I would recommend this product to anyone who loves his/her teeth as much as I do ;)[[ASIN:B004S7EYE4 2 Rotadent (Rota-dent) Brush Heads - Short Point NEW]]</li>
    <li> I bought a Rotadent system and then left the dentist so I could not find replacement brushes. The brushes I received work well with my system and I have much better dental checkups using this system with good brushes.</li>
    <li> Thanks again.  They really keep my teeth clean.  I would recommend these brushes to anyone.  Got to keep on going here.</li>
    <li> I have gone through about 8 of these EXPENSIVE brush heads on my Rotadent since 6/12.  Once I charge the battery and the motor is at full power, it&#x27;s vital NOT to get the head pressed against your teeth and inner cheek.  Any pressure on the gears of the brush head will cause them to strip and become useless.&lt;br /&gt;I have had MANY electric toothbrushes in my day and this is the first time ($150+ later) I&#x27;ve experienced this.  I suspect it&#x27;s better than the handle/motor stripping the gears as that would be a much more expensive replacement, but unfortunately I find myself using the Braun electric brush I&#x27;ve used for years.  It&#x27;s much more reliable and durable in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Not happy with these at all.  They do not vibrate like they are suppose to do.</li>
    <li> I was pretty sure I was ordering the correct brush heads. When they arrived there was a warning on them to check and make sure they were what i needed before opening the package. I thought that very considerate and made me double check. Yes! They were exactly what I needed. A++++ rating and would definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Quick delivery. Competitively priced. Easy to access website and to place order. Recommend to anyone using this type of Rotadent.</li>
    <li> I bought a new Rotadent and 2 sets of brushes for $100...and to replace the brushes was $70.00?  Way over-priced!</li>
    <li> Dental hygiene is so important for me, that&#x27;s why I use Rotadent. These replacement heads fit an older model, purchased it about 3 yrs ago.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer these pointy heads to the flat ones, but this is just personal preference.</li>
    <li> Items arrived as described, and in good condition.  I am very pleased with the quality of the items and the cost was good as well.</li>
    <li> I bought my Rotadent brush 7 years ago &amp; have been using it ever since.  This is the first time I did not buy the heads from my dentist.  I am very satisfied with the total product, &amp; I use it daily. Amazon is consistently a reliable source for me.</li>
    <li> The brush works well, gets into the spaces between teeth and follows the gum line without irritating same. I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> MY HUSBAND AND I EACH HAVE OUR OWN ROTADENT.  I AM HAPPY THAT WE WERE ABLE TO GET THE REFILL BRUSH HEADS NEEDED FOR THIS MODEL, SINCE THIS IS NOT THE LATEST MODEL.</li>
    <li> This kind of brush head is better than the round flat kind to go over all the small area in your teeth</li>
    <li> I love to use my rotadent brush specially with the classic brush head,makes my teeth cleaner so my mouth feels cleaner too !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Rotadent handle and brush heads for years.  These brushes appear to be the same and perform seamlessly.  Would definitely recommend to anyone.  Used to replace at my dental visits, but ordering online is available any time and less costly.</li>
    <li> These are the right heads for my Rotadent, and I am so happy to still be able to find these.  The newer ones don&#x27;t work very well, so I hope someone keeps stocking these.  Also, the package arrived timely and in good condition.</li>
    <li> they do not work in my Rotadent</li>
    <li> Good product hideously overpriced. I keep buying them because they work but I cringe every time. Not a good value.</li>
    <li> Great price and great product!!!!! Will buy from again!!!!</li>
    <li> Love my new brushes, I received them 2-3 days sooner than predicted. There were others out there at a lesser price but then they added S&amp;H, which brought you up to either the same price or more.  Now that I have the new brushes I realize I need to order the flat head one, I will place that order with same seller.  Good job and thank you.</li>
    <li> I would reorder these again</li>
    <li> I bought these as extras for my son who has braces and uses the Rotadent.  They are the same good quality brushes directly from the company and we have not had any issues.  My son uses his Rotadent several times a day with this bush and the other brushes and they do last quite a long time.  I imagine he won&#x27;t need to use the other that came with this two pack for quite some time.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite tooth care instrument, I was glad to find it and very pleased that I have a spare that came along with it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
    <li> I have found these products to be an excellent way to clean ones teeth. You have to be carefull when ordering though, do to the fact that they have a new power handle tooth brush. So if you have the old power handle, you must make sure you are ordering the correct brush heads for said power handle.</li>
    <li> The Rotadent replacement tips arrived earlier than expected and are perfect for our electric toothbrush!</li>
    <li> I HAVE MY 2ND ROTADENT TOOTHBRUSH AND THE SUPPLIES FOR THE OLDER MODEL ARE GETTING HARDER TO FIND, SO PURCHASED SEVERAL TO KEEP ON HAND.  WILL HOPE THEY WORK WELL.</li>
    <li> Have used Rotadent recommended by my dentist 20 years ago after he needed to do a plaque removal in spite of what I thought was excellent hygiene: flossing and brushing twice every day.  Ever since using this regularly-no cavities or need for anything other than yearly cleaning which takes only 25 minutes because there is not much to clean.  This is so much better than water picks or anything else.  They also send you the Rotapoint plastic cleaners to really get the margins better than just water can.</li>
    <li> when this is attached to the rotadent toothbrush, it goes very slow when trying to clean between teeth.  Not like the factory replacements.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Rotadent user for over 20 years. The brush heads are ridiculously expensive so I&#x27;ve tried purchasing them in different places. Most of them work just fine. However, I&#x27;ve had some problems with the ones ordered online. One of them would not rotate, and it was not the base that had a low battery or anything (since the old brush head worked just fine). I thought this was a one-off problem. Then a new one has bristles that are extremely soft, kind of like brushing my teeth with a marshmallow. They have started to stick out in various directions after just two weeks of use. The manufacturer may have a quality control issue.</li>
    <li> Great brush for an affordable price</li>
    <li> Item was as advertised. I have purchased replacement products of this type many times. I am very satisfied with the product. I have used Rotodent brushes with much success.</li>
    <li> If you want clean teeth and have a small mouth this is the toothbrush tip for you.  Very easy to use and lasts a long time well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Bristles seem to flatten out much faster the originals and seem softer than the original brushs that came with brush.</li>
    <li> They came on time! EXACTLY what I expected!&lt;br /&gt;I just wish they came in BLACK like my handle! Two more words.</li>
    <li> While the product is OK I did find the short point tip to really not be very \\&quot;sharp\\&quot; more of a broader brush so hard to get in for betweeh teth cleaning The worst part is while the price \\&quot;seems\\&quot; competitve the delivery charge is ,simply put,STEALING. $23 for normal shipping of a super small item that probaly cost them as buck or 2 to ship so BEWARE</li>
    <li> Keeps my teeth clean and controls plaque</li>
    <li> I have been using this classic Rotadent for well over a decade. Rotadent has invented one of the best electronic toothbrush out there. Rotadent brush heads clean better than other brands, I&#x27;ve tried others. After my old brush heads starting wearing out, I needed to buy new ones. These pointed tips clean in between the teeth really well, I use the flat heads to clean and polish after. I am currently wearing braces, so they get in between where I need the extra cleaning. When I visit my dentists and orthodontist, they are so amazed how very clean my teeth are compared to others who also have braces.  I am giving it four stars because the replacement brush heads are expensive and I did not get what was pictured.  For the price I paid, I appreciated that it came in a pair and for some odd reason, the brush heads I received were more blunt and flat at the tip. I am very thankful that this classic model is still available, it works just as wonderful as it did when I first got it.</li>
    <li> These brushes are what I needed, expected and received.  It&#x27;s easier buying them on-line than remembering to get an adequate supply when I go to the dentist for a check-up.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed, prompt service and good quality.</li>
    <li> good price and arrived quickly. too bad it&#x27;s the last of the lot.</li>
    <li> I needed replacements for my rotadent - these came quickly and the price was reasonable.  I will use this dealer again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item for years. I usually purchase them from my dentist but could not find any dental offices in my new city that carries them.</li>
    <li> Happy with price and purchase, I like that I can buy what I need and not have to buy one of each.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
