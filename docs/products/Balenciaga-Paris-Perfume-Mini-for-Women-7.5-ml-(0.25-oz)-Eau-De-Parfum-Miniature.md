      <li>THE SCENT IS GREAT AND LASTS FOR EVER!</li>
      <li>Perfume smell wonderful...</li>
      <li>The price was excellent for a designer perfume.</li>
      <li>Awesome doesn&#x27;t even begin to describe this perfume.</li>
      <li>What a beautiful scent!</li>
      <li>Perfect ize for your purse.</li>
      <li>Men, take note - this is a great gift for your lady.</li>
      <li>GREAT PRICE</li>
      <li>In the end, it&#x27;s probably a great idea to go to a Sephora store and get a sample of it.</li>
      <li>Very nice perfume.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure she would like the scent so the mini size was a perfect choice.</li>
      <li>The best way to tell if a perfume is suited to smell lovely on you is to know what works with your body chemistry.  </li>
      <li>Good to wear for dinner out; will not interfere with the food.</li>
      <li>I know that pepper smells nicely on me, as well as fragrant flowers and citrus.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of like taking a car for a test drive, push it to the limits to see if it works with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I find this comical, as I have a son older than those inquiring, but it is nice to know that you smell great, isn&#x27;t it?  </li>
      <li>I give it a 4 because I wish it were a bit more assertive.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d spend my money on Vince Camuto for which I get many compliments.</li>
      <li>All of my girlfriends love this</li>
      <li>Light, clean ,and  pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>THESE LITTLE GEMS ARE MAGNIFICENT!</li>
      <li>nice soft sophisticated scent.</li>
      <li>I wear it for special occassions.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is true and like the Balenciaga I bought in France.</li>
      <li>Glad they are still making real perfumes that do not reek of candy or coconut.</li>
      <li>This has a very destinctive smell and it is not worn by to many ladies, but its a goodie.</li>
      <li>Classy, just a beautiful, somewhat potent rose smell in the beginning, but dries down to a subtle nice floral, but not flowery.</li>
      <li>On me it smells like soft violet flowers, on another person I&#x27;ve smelled the patchouli more.</li>
      <li>AND DEFINITELY WORTH BUYING FOR YOURSELF</li>
      <li>The fragnance is absolutely identical to the original sample I bought at the store a while ago.</li>
      <li>My favorite note in this fragrance, violet, seems more an afterthought than the leading note; and the cedar is missing.</li>
      <li>The cap on the bottle is working perfectly (unlike some other caps on parfumes I bought before from other sites).  </li>
      <li>Also seems heavier and more cloying, possibly because it&#x27;s not a spray?</li>
      <li>Overall I was really satisfied with this purchase.</li>
      <li>Love this so much that I bought the giant size after I got this.  </li>
      <li>I ordered from the same vendor, this mini bottle seems fine.  </li>
      <li>It was not perfume but a bottle of smelly alcohol that fortunately evaporated almost instantly.</li>
      <li>; this is a close to skin scent, a bit too much so for me.</li>
      <li>Now patchcouli never smelled nicely on me, but with it being a small amount it compliments the pepper and violet leaves in this.</li>
      <li>This is my new staple fragrance that I receive tons of compliments on.</li>
      <li>Had not tried this fragrance prior to ordering but really like it.  </li>
      <li>This is a soft, sensual and sofisticated fragrance.</li>
      <li>A sophisticated scent with a chilly natural violet set against a cedar pencil shavings wood.  </li>

<li> This fragrance goes with any time of the day, to any event, no matter how casual or formal....</li>

    <li> Now ladies,this is a scent worth having !!!!!!Awesome doesn&#x27;t even begin to describe this perfume.Gotta get yourself a bottle... I smell like a million bucks and I am loving every minute of it!!!!!</li>
    <li> This perfume doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it just smell like the Balenciaga Paris from Sephora that I was in love this.  It&#x27;s alright, I&#x27;ll wear it but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it nor would I buy it again.</li>
    <li> Perfume smell wonderful...nice soft sophisticated scent.</li>
    <li> The product came on time and as described.  The cap on the bottle is working perfectly (unlike some other caps on parfumes I bought before from other sites).  The fragnance is absolutely identical to the original sample I bought at the store a while ago. Overall I was really satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Classy, just a beautiful, somewhat potent rose smell in the beginning, but dries down to a subtle nice floral, but not flowery. Evening wear for me. It is not a sweet candy smell, thank goodness</li>
    <li> Lovely, and hard to find, violet base floral.  Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t last on me.  Each person can be different, so I advise getting a sample for your individual chemistry reaction to perfumes.</li>
    <li> It was not perfume but a bottle of smelly alcohol that fortunately evaporated almost instantly.</li>
    <li> There was no reason to think I was purchasing a spray on version of Paris, although that is what I received and in very short time. Never having tried the &amp;#34;dab&amp;#34; on form of the fragrance, I was mildly disappointed to find that it doesn&#x27;t have the same lasting quality as the spray one.</li>
    <li> Perfect ize for your purse.</li>
    <li> What a beautiful scent! This is a soft, sensual and sofisticated fragrance. This can be worn daily or for a night out on the town. This is my new staple fragrance that I receive tons of compliments on. The best way to tell if a perfume is suited to smell lovely on you is to know what works with your body chemistry.  I know that pepper smells nicely on me, as well as fragrant flowers and citrus. Now patchcouli never smelled nicely on me, but with it being a small amount it compliments the pepper and violet leaves in this. This perfume has notes that are illumiated with what ever your body chemistry pulls out of it. On me it smells like soft violet flowers, on another person I&#x27;ve smelled the patchouli more. In the end, it&#x27;s probably a great idea to go to a Sephora store and get a sample of it. Wear it to the gym. I feel that you can find out if a fragrance works with you by sweating. It&#x27;s kind of like taking a car for a test drive, push it to the limits to see if it works with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent notes: pepper, violet leaves, violet, cedarwood, patchouli, vetiver.</li>
    <li> Not your run of the mill fruity floral.  A sophisticated scent with a chilly natural violet set against a cedar pencil shavings wood.  Very, very quiet; this is a close to skin scent, a bit too much so for me. Good to wear for dinner out; will not interfere with the food. Glad they are still making real perfumes that do not reek of candy or coconut. I give it a 4 because I wish it were a bit more assertive.</li>
    <li> Had not tried this fragrance prior to ordering but really like it.  Requires very little.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my mom. Wasn&#x27;t sure she would like the scent so the mini size was a perfect choice. The price was excellent for a designer perfume.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t thrill me like the magazine sniff strip did. I&#x27;d spend my money on Vince Camuto for which I get many compliments.</li>
    <li> This has a very destinctive smell and it is not worn by to many ladies, but its a goodie. I wear it for special occassions.</li>
    <li> THESE LITTLE GEMS ARE MAGNIFICENT! THE SCENT IS GREAT AND LASTS FOR EVER! GREAT PRICE AND DEFINITELY WORTH BUYING FOR YOURSELF OR AS A GIFT FOR SOMEONE.</li>
    <li> Love this so much that I bought the giant size after I got this.  Guys ask me all the time, what are you wearing?  I find this comical, as I have a son older than those inquiring, but it is nice to know that you smell great, isn&#x27;t it?  This fragrance goes with any time of the day, to any event, no matter how casual or formal....one of my 2 favorites now and I am a perfume addict!  All of my girlfriends love this and we all have very different preferences in the fragrance department, so I think it is a definite winner. Men, take note - this is a great gift for your lady.</li>
    <li> Unlike the larger bottle of Balenciaga I ordered from the same vendor, this mini bottle seems fine.  The fragrance is true and like the Balenciaga I bought in France.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m finding this different from the spray version from Sephora. My favorite note in this fragrance, violet, seems more an afterthought than the leading note; and the cedar is missing. Also seems heavier and more cloying, possibly because it&#x27;s not a spray? Still, it is not smelling exactly as I expected.</li>
    <li> Very nice perfume.Light, clean ,and  pleasant scent. Does not last long.Not at all overpowering. Perfect for summer.</li>
