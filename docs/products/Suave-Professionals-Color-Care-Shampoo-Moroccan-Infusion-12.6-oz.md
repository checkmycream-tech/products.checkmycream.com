<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great product and shipping!</li>
    <li> I have used Pantene shampoo and conditioner for over two decades now, and this shampoo has pushed it to the side.  Or rather I should say, the Suave Moroccan Infusion Color Care Shampoo has JOINED Pantene in my shower, as I alternate between the two shampoos so that I don&#x27;t fall victim to &#x27;build up&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly long hair these days.  It&#x27;s about half way down my back (I&#x27;m working on the sexy librarian look) and two of the problems I&#x27;ve faced is dryness and tangling.  I&#x27;ve found that this Suave Shampoo does an excellent job of cleaning my hair without additionally drying it. Plus it leaves it soft and shiny.  This is pretty much my experience with Pantene too, except for the shiny part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DEFINITELY recommend this shampoo.  Though I don&#x27;t have color treated hair, I find that the shampoo meant for those who chemically alter their hair is gentler and leaves my hair in better shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try out the conditioner too.  It&#x27;s really nice.</li>
    <li> My whole family loves this shampoo.  Smells like Moroccan Oil, heavenly.</li>
    <li> Cleans well without stripping.  I&#x27;ve been very pleased.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! Gentle on your hair, smells great, lathers great. No sense in buying expensive brands!</li>
    <li> Good shampoo for the price.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  I don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner with it.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  Leaves my hair soft, shiny and manageable.  Will definitely purchase this one again.  Love all the Suave products.  They are just as nice as the salon products but more inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Great scent and leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Great product by suave. They really outdid themselves. It works just as well as any salon brand and it&#x27;s cheap! Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I really like the new Suave Moroccan line of hair and body care stuff. It&#x27;s like they have stepped up their game with regard to quality and results, but kept the prices affordable as always. This smells good and feels silky in your hand, it lathers richly also. My hair is clean, soft and looks great after using both this shampoo and the partner conditioner.</li>
    <li> Works well for my hair. My personal opinion is that it&#x27;s a bit oily and heavy and doesn&#x27;t work well if you shampoo your hair everyday.  I use with the conditioner, but don&#x27;t really a big difference with the shampoo.</li>
    <li> My color still washed out</li>
    <li> Why spend tons when you can get the same results with Suave?  This shampoo is awesome!  Love the smell and how my hair feels clean.&lt;br /&gt;I use both shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Works well. Makes my curly hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Great price. Great scent, which is light and reminds me of vanilla. Lathers nicely and along with the conditioner leaves my hair feeling clean and fresh. I don&#x27;t color my hair, but I figured it would be gentler than regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this shampoo and it did make my hair soft. However, the bottle states that it&#x27;s for color treated hair but, it stripped all of the color from my greys!! Nope, no way, won&#x27;t use it again.&lt;br /&gt;Now my husband uses it and he likes it just fine.</li>
    <li> My mom loves it! Her hair doesn&#x27;t fall out as much!</li>
    <li> Great product. I love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp at all. It&#x27;s a great value too.</li>
    <li> product as described--shipped in 2 days</li>
    <li> Used this after dying my hair and it kept it pretty healthy</li>
    <li> I really like this product. And the price can&#x27;t be beat. It leaves my hair soft and clean. I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo--especially for the price!</li>
    <li> I really like the Suave Moroccan argan oil hair care products.  The smell is great and my hair is full and shiny.  Also great that it is made for color-treated hair. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> great product I&#x27;ve been using this for several years won&#x27;t use anything else. Great smell</li>
    <li> This shampoo works well except the fragrance. It smells terrible.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item for myself. Love Suave products, recommend highly for color hair.</li>
    <li> My hair feels softer than it&#x27;s felt in a long time.  Would definitely recommend without hesitation.  Outshines my much more expensive shampoos.  What a bargain!  I am a convert.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo for me. It leaves my hair nice and soft.</li>
    <li> Lovely item. Smells good. Helps a little bit, but i will definately need to add the conditioners to the regiment.</li>
    <li> I have colored hair (every 6 to 8 weeks).  I was looking for a cheaper shampoo which would enhance my color and help it last as long as possible.  I had been purchasing a shampoo and conditioner from the color company and then tried a shampoo I had bought previously from Avon.  This Suave shampoo, though, is terrific!  It makes my hair smooth and silky and so far, has kept my color looking like it should.  I am very pleased and will definitely buy this shampoo again.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t a fan of the smell, but it did do a great good at cleansing my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried more expensive shampoos and conditioners for color-treated hair and this one is the best. My hair feels so soft.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is my favorite.  It not only smells wonderful, my hair smells great for days and it is so gentle that my hair never gets dry or damaged.&lt;br /&gt;I am putting it on auto delivery so I don&#x27;t have to worry about my local store being sold out as it is often hard to find.</li>
    <li> A great product for the price!</li>
    <li> I noticed that it leaked a little from the hole in the lid when I received it from Amazon.  I have used other Suave products and have been happy with them in the past, so I overlooked the leak and used the shampoo anyway.  Then my scalp started itching.  I stopped using it and later gave it to my boyfriend who has a dry scalp.  I thought I must be allergic to Moroccan argon oil.  My boyfriend later told me that his scalp was itching too and he stopped using the shampoo.  The shampoo might be fine....  but now I am suspicious of the leak.  I am throwing this item out !!!</li>
    <li> For the price I got this shampoo I was not expecting much but it will now be my new go to.</li>
    <li> Addictively great smell, doesn&#x27;t dry out hair and feels great.  I think this is my favorite non-extravagantly priced line of shampoo and conditioner now for color treated hair.</li>
    <li> I was using a salon brand that is 3x the price and I got a sample of this in the mail. I fell in love with the scent and how it soft it made my hair feel. The shampoo does an amazing job of cleansing without stripping and smells unbelievable and the conditioner actually detangles my hair. My hair feels silky, healthy, and looks shiny. I was so happy with the shampoo and conditioner, I also purchased the macadamia nut and white orchid oil spray, it makes my hair easier to comb, leaves it feeling silkier, healthier, and doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine textured hair down. These products are now part of my permanent haircare regimen and they all together probably cost the same amount as one salon brand shampoo bottle. Such a great value.</li>
    <li> I have long, corse, grey-hair, I dye dark with Henna. It drys out, loses it&#x27;s color and gets put through the paces with the blow dryer and iron. It&#x27;s hard to believe I don&#x27;t have to keep paying a lot to get silky, shiney hair that behaves. This shampoo is worth a try if you&#x27;re tired of high-price salon products.</li>
    <li> leaves hair clean but a lil weighed down.</li>
    <li> Provides great shine and a terrific scent. I buy this regularly instead of Herbal Essence. Better value and product, real nice!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t care for the smell, but for the price it got the work done.</li>
    <li> Great item! Great price!</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve found for color treated hair for the price. I love the smell and the way my hair responds. With fine hair I especially appreciate this product. Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
    <li> great for everyday washing</li>
    <li> Love the scent! leaves my hair feeling very clean and full of body. recommended to my sister and daughters and friends</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and its matching conditioner.  Smooths both my hair and my q 3-year-old daughter&#x27;s waist length hair too.  Even when I run out of conditioner, the shampoo alone  conditions my hair beautifully.  Use Subscribe and Save for more savings!</li>
    <li> Great to use during the winter to control static electricity.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is really nice with the Moroccan oil which what a lot of people is trying to use on their hair. My hair is soft and silky love the feel. I would definitely like you to purchase it and treat your hair.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo.  It is easy on my colored hair, smells great and leaves my hair soft and not greasy.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff when coupled along with its partner conditioner. It leaves my hair soft, smooth and shiny and has a sexy scent that lasts for hours!</li>
    <li> I love the Moroccan line of products, well priced, smells wonderful, does a great job on your hair. This is my new go to shampoo and conditioner, both my husband I love it, there is something luxurious about it.</li>
    <li> Kind of smells like a ladies musk perfume. Will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> finally found the BEST shampoo. Have color treated gray hair, so achieving soft and manageable texture has been frustrating. This shampoo and conditioner do the job. Try combining these products with WEN to condition. My hair is finally as soft and manageable as it was before the grays.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Can&#x27;t really tell if it does actually help my overly-dyed hair a lot, but I say to give it a try and see what it can do for you!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!  It smells wonderful! It makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
    <li> Definitely boosts my color/highlights and makes my hair very soft but it is very heavy on my fine hair and weighs it down making styling a challenge. It&#x27;s gentle enough to use for everyday but I find I need to use a stronger shampoo about once a week to help &amp;#34;unweigh&amp;#34; my hair and add volume.</li>
    <li> we love this shampoo, I&#x27;ve used pricey name brands and we have since exclusively been using this line.  love the smell and feel.</li>
    <li> Another great Suave moroccan oil product! It is gentle on colored hair and helps tame any frizzies.</li>
    <li> good price for shampoo &amp; conditioner</li>
    <li> It works good however the Kerratin conditioner works way better than this one.</li>
