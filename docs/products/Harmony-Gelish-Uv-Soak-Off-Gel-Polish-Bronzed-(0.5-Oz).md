      <li>Love love love!</li>
      <li>I liked this color, I&#x27;m giving it 4/5 stars though because I thought it would be more of a shimmery color instead of being more of a glittery polish (I thought it was going to be like the Orly brand nail polish called &#x27;Rage&#x27;).</li>
      <li>This is a gorgeous color that, with two coats, will give your nails a beautiful glittery cover, with a color that&#x27;s muted enough to not be ostentatious.</li>
      <li>The color is a lot more gold than bronze.</li>
      <li>Love it and Love the June Bride color, Gossip Girl, so many.....</li>
      <li>Not my favorite glitter.</li>
      <li>It takes too many coats by itself to show like the picture.</li>

      <li>I have been using Gelish for over a year now and love the products.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>

      <li>Not in love with the color...</li>
      <li>But I wish they would have more shimmery colors instead of glittery ones.</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m In Love With the Way</li>
      <li>more like it appears in the picture.</li>
      <li>so it shows up better.</li>
      <li>It might be better used as a glitter coat over another color.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love Gelish polish.</li>
      <li>I love Gelish.  </li>
      <li>it is more of a gold.  </li>
      <li>Two coats for light gold or one cost over another color for a nice glitter.</li>
      <li>I love the color and it lasted two weeks.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this gel nail polish.</li>
      <li>Maybe it could be paired with a solid color to get the best look.</li>
      <li>To get coverage, it&#x27;ll take many coats.  </li>
      <li>One of my favorite color :)</li>
      <li>more gold.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS</li>
      <li>Love this color, it looks like a mixture of gold and bronze.</li>
      <li>I love gelish products</li>
      <li>It Looks More Like A Light Tan Brown GolD</li>
      <li>/&gt;It takes two coats of just this to make it look nice, but it is worth it.</li>
      <li>Sometmes the Gellish gliter polish takes lots of coats to get a good glitter on your nail, but this polish is very concentrated of glitter</li>
      <li>(Due to monitor adjustments).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try my best to describe this:&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Easily</li>
      <li>Right now I have this colour on top of two coats of Taupe Model and the effect is stunning.</li>
      <li>You can get a nice goldish bronze if you&#x27;re willing to take the time to do a lot of coats.</li>
      <li>It is just not the color for me but the seller did fine.</li>
      <li>The bronze color goes on smooth and easy.  </li>
      <li>quite attractive with sheer coverage but definately not a hint of brown.</li>
      <li>the $$$$ added up and now I use the Gelish products with the light.</li>
      <li>is an transparent color filled with a bronze color glitter.</li>
      <li>Not a bronze color more like a golden champagne color.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very clear and seems like more of a glitter top coat.</li>
      <li>Vegas Nights is my most favorite by far!  </li>
      <li>So far, Gelish is the only brand I&#x27;ve used, but if the directions are followed correctly, your nails finish looking awesome!</li>
      <li>This polish is great alone of you can use it as a first or second coat with another Gelish color.</li>
      <li>Yes, I Got Full Coveraged</li>
      <li>Great to add over other colors to give it a sparkle.</li>
      <li>It is actually super versatile because it can be used lightly over another color by using one coat, or it can be used by itself, imitating the picture exactly as shown, if you use 3-4 coats.</li>
      <li>Not always a huge fan of sparkle, but this color looks pretty with the bronze.</li>
      <li>But still very pretty and shimmery.</li>
      <li>My hands look so much prettier and more feminine now that I find myself glancing down at them many times a day, and I&#x27;ve found many an Elementary girl student of mine stroking my shiny nails during our conversations about their artwork.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s more like clear with some sparkles in it.  </li>
      <li>did end up having just the slightest wear at the tips of my nails by about ten days in, but my application of this color was my first time applying my own gel manicure, and I know for a fact that I laid my layers of foundation, color, and top coat on FAR thicker than I should&#x27;ve!</li>
      <li>Even still, with all that said, I can&#x27;t keep normal nail polish on my nails for more than about TWELVE HOURS without it cracking and chipping off, so my new gel nail set is an absolute dream come true!</li>
      <li>arrived super fast.</li>
      <li>It looks so fantastic and professionally done!</li>
      <li>To get better color and coverage we used 3 coats instead of only 2.</li>
      <li>B006IBM21K 54 WATT ROYAL NAILS PROFESSIONAL UV LIGHT GEL AND ACRILIC NAIL DRYER &amp; CURING</li>
      <li>Their colours are always so pretty.</li>
      <li>This is so pretty and sparkley but not in a gaudy way.  </li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>This colour is a sheer glittery bronze colour so you would have to do many coats to get it to look like swatch in the picture.</li>
      <li>Still pretty but transparent.</li>
      <li>I probably will have to layer it over a different color to get more of a bronze tone.</li>
      <li>most definitely will buy again!</li>
      <li>haven&#x27;t tried it over any other color yet, but from the pictures I&#x27;ve seen online, it would look nice.</li>
      <li>This one covers too much of the color underneath but is not a pretty color on its own.</li>
      <li>it sits in a orangish polish, not clear, that i don&#x27;t love.</li>
      <li>They last 2-3 weeks, easy to get off</li>
      <li>Its very smooth and lasts a very long time!!</li>
      <li>and all colors i have purchased from this particular brand!</li>
      <li>, I received it in a reasonable length of time.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> love this color! and all colors i have purchased from this particular brand! most definitely will buy again! thank you!</li>
    <li> I have purchased several glitter Gelish products.  This one is my least favorite.  It is clear with gold glitter &amp; it is larger size glitter than Vegas Nights.  Vegas Nights is my most favorite by far!  This one covers too much of the color underneath but is not a pretty color on its own.</li>
    <li> The polish was thin and looked like orange glitter instead of bronze. Not impressed</li>
    <li> while this product is named \\&quot;bronzed\\&quot; it is rather a gold metallic looking gel.  quite attractive with sheer coverage but definately not a hint of brown.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color. Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I was hoping it looked like the picture but it&#x27;s more like clear with some sparkles in it.  Nice but not for me.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite color :)</li>
    <li> I LOVE this gel nail polish. So far, Gelish is the only brand I&#x27;ve used, but if the directions are followed correctly, your nails finish looking awesome! I liked this color, I&#x27;m giving it 4/5 stars though because I thought it would be more of a shimmery color instead of being more of a glittery polish (I thought it was going to be like the Orly brand nail polish called &#x27;Rage&#x27;). Nevertheless, it&#x27;s a good nail polish. But I wish they would have more shimmery colors instead of glittery ones. I&#x27;ll upload a picture.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve just turned the big Four-Oh, I decided that I&#x27;d treat myself to a purely girly gift for my big day this year. I chose this color as one of the components of my new gel manicure set, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier that I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone that likes a subtle, neutral color with some serious sparkle on their nails, look no further than Harmony Gelish&#x27;s Bronzed. This is a gorgeous color that, with two coats, will give your nails a beautiful glittery cover, with a color that&#x27;s muted enough to not be ostentatious. And, cured in my [[ASIN:B006IBM21K 54 WATT ROYAL NAILS PROFESSIONAL UV LIGHT GEL AND ACRILIC NAIL DRYER &amp; CURING RN541 WORKS WITH CND, SHELLAC, OPI, HARMONY GELLISH, IBD GELAC, ETC.. FOR DOUBLE. HANDS OR FEET.]], it finishes off hard and firm, but with just enough give to get you through two weeks of wear with little to no damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did end up having just the slightest wear at the tips of my nails by about ten days in, but my application of this color was my first time applying my own gel manicure, and I know for a fact that I laid my layers of foundation, color, and top coat on FAR thicker than I should&#x27;ve! This made it easy for the excess gel polish to start pulling up on the edges of a few of my fingers, and by my picking at the ample layer that I used to cap each nail, I am pretty much at fault for the color chipping off there. Even still, with all that said, I can&#x27;t keep normal nail polish on my nails for more than about TWELVE HOURS without it cracking and chipping off, so my new gel nail set is an absolute dream come true! My hands look so much prettier and more feminine now that I find myself glancing down at them many times a day, and I&#x27;ve found many an Elementary girl student of mine stroking my shiny nails during our conversations about their artwork. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another tip for anyone trying to find this in their local Sally Beauty Supply store - I wouldn&#x27;t even suggest you bother. On the off chance that they have this color, it is very, VERY likely that they&#x27;ll only have the mini bottles (which only hold 2/3 of what this bottle that I got on Amazon does), and those will cost you more - $14.99 - than what you&#x27;ll pay for nearly double the polish here.

    <li> Gelish is a nice and easy way to keep my nails beauty for up to 3 weeks!! I love it, this color is nice but is not a solid color I usually put it over black, pink or white base color it looks beautiful</li>
    <li> Definitely, Not A Hint of A Bronzed. It Looks More Like A Light Tan Brown GolD Tone Then Fully Copper Bronzed. I Use It As A Base For French To Get That Glitter Tone To It For My Yours And I&#x27;m In Love With the Way It Turned Out!! Yes, I Got Full Coveraged Easily And I Will Order Again As Soon As I Run Out. Gelish Is Amazing!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Gelish polish. Their colours are always so pretty. This colour is a sheer glittery bronze colour so you would have to do many coats to get it to look like swatch in the picture. I tend to use the sheer glitter colours as a topper over complimentary colours. Right now I have this colour on top of two coats of Taupe Model and the effect is stunning. I would buy this colour again.</li>
    <li> The color is a must-have. It is actually super versatile because it can be used lightly over another color by using one coat, or it can be used by itself, imitating the picture exactly as shown, if you use 3-4 coats. You can rock this look on holidays, you can wear it subtlely on a daily basis- either way you&#x27;re guaranteed to get compliments everywhere you go! I like to use the ombre technique using this polish paired with another color for the base. It looks so fantastic and professionally done!</li>
    <li> not really the color I expected. more gold. not bronze</li>
    <li> The best gel polish ever.</li>
    <li> I bought this expecting a solid gold finish, but after applying FOUR layers I could still see through to my nail base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the upside, it works well as a sheer gold coating to layer over solid colors</li>
    <li> I decided to try this polish and it was &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; but not great by itself.  Layering it over another color is probably the way to go and I plan to try that the next time I use it.</li>
    <li> It is just not the color for me but the seller did fine.</li>
    <li> this is a nice color. it&#x27;s subtle gold glitter rather than a blingy dazzle. very pretty without being too flashy.</li>
    <li> This is so pretty and sparkley but not in a gaudy way.  Has lasted almost 2 weeks without any chipping! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Very pretty and looks great along side the Taffeta color!</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, looks great.  Not always a huge fan of sparkle, but this color looks pretty with the bronze.</li>
    <li> This gold has a little more color with the sparkle so it shows up better. I also have the Moroccan Spice by IBD which is a beautiful color but is so see through that it is barley noticeable. This color shines and the gold glitter sparkles with the gold tinted polish it is mixed with</li>
    <li> I like it as a top coat on other colors.</li>
    <li> Terrific nail product for UV gel nails.  The bronze color goes on smooth and easy.  Is nice to wear on its own or as a sparkly top coat.</li>
    <li> I love the color and it lasted two weeks. Everyday it look like I just put it on. Love this color, it looks like a mixture of gold and bronze.</li>
    <li> Great to add over other colors to give it a sparkle. I love gelish products</li>
    <li> Like I said before , One of the hardest things of buying polish online is figuring out the color (Due to monitor adjustments).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try my best to describe this:&lt;br /&gt;This is an transparent color filled with a bronze color glitter. You&#x27;ll need several layers to get it to be a solid  color.&lt;br /&gt;Very Sparkly. I loved it.</li>
    <li> This is gold flecks in clear polish.  To get coverage, it&#x27;ll take many coats.  The color is another pefect gold but to wear this fancy color, it&#x27;ll take a lot of work.  Maybe it could be paired with a solid color to get the best look.</li>
    <li> it looks really good over the need a tan color. arrived super fast. i love it! will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> Even when layering it still is see-through.  And it is not bronzed.. it is more of a gold.  Still pretty but transparent.</li>
    <li> This product is not really what I expected.  It&#x27;s very clear and seems like more of a glitter top coat. You can get a nice goldish bronze if you&#x27;re willing to take the time to do a lot of coats. I like it but wish it was more like it appears in the picture.</li>
    <li> This Gelish nail polish goes on kind of thin and light. To get better color and coverage we used 3 coats instead of only 2. It turned out beautifully. Depending on the lighting it is a gold or orange or even rust color with lots of sparkle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love gel nail polish. It lasts me around 3 weeks or so.</li>
    <li> This nail polish looks good on top of another color. It takes too many coats by itself to show like the picture. Not my favorite glitter.</li>
    <li> I used to go and get the fills etc....the $$$$ added up and now I use the Gelish products with the light. They last 2-3 weeks, easy to get off and I get compliments all the time. This polish is great alone of you can use it as a first or second coat with another Gelish color. Love it and Love the June Bride color, Gossip Girl, so many.....</li>
    <li> I am newly obsessed with Gelish nail polish. I want each and every color! This goes on like champagne and is beautiful with 2 coats. Its very smooth and lasts a very long time!! Love love love!</li>
    <li> Sometmes the Gellish gliter polish takes lots of coats to get a good glitter on your nail, but this polish is very concentrated of glitter so you don&#x27;t have to gob it on at all.</li>
    <li> I love Gelish.  I have never had any lifting with this polish, and it met my expectations, I received it in a reasonable length of time.</li>
    <li> The color is a lot more gold than bronze. I probably will have to layer it over a different color to get more of a bronze tone. But still very pretty and shimmery.</li>
    <li> This is a soft colour with sparkle.  As I have said on my other reviews, I go for the softer colours.  This one has a sparkle which I also like.  This brand is the only gel nail colour that I use.</li>
    <li> Is really a top coat. Do not use alone like the red glitter one. :/</li>
    <li> Not a bronze color more like a golden champagne color.</li>
    <li> I have been using Gelish for over a year now and love the products. Since I wash my hands a LOT ( job requirement) the gelish has helps my nails stay in decent shape.</li>
    <li> Nice light gold / copper color. Two coats for light gold or one cost over another color for a nice glitter.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS COLOR!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes two coats of just this to make it look nice, but it is worth it. Its the perfect amount of &amp;#34;bling&amp;#34; and sparkle for work without being IN YOUR FACE!&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried it over any other color yet, but from the pictures I&#x27;ve seen online, it would look nice.</li>
    <li> Not in love with the color... it sits in a orangish polish, not clear, that i don&#x27;t love. I could live without it.</li>
    <li> I have a few different Harmony Gelish polishes, but this color seems to want to peel easy. It might be better used as a glitter coat over another color. I found that I have to do at least 3 coats for the polish to really show, and that might be what is contributing to the peeling.</li>
    <li> Great color, love Gelish polish! Would highly recommend. This color looks great over the Gelish color nude. Perfect neutral sparkly combo for spring.</li>
    <li> the color is nice and it took about 3 weeks for the color to start coming off. But that&#x27;s only if you do it correctly with the UV lighting and the timing and the base and top coat of polish.</li>
