### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Awesome!!!</li>
      <li>Works great awesome product</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m delighted with this product!</li>
      <li>But all was good in the end.</li>
      <li>Love OPI!</li>
      <li>As I use gel to reinforce and protect my severely split nails, I was delighted that OPI had produced a matte top coat...</li>
      <li>shame because it was a good price, even with delivery to Scotland, and very quick.</li>
      <li>This makes them more of a satin finish.</li>
      <li>dont buy this version, use the orly matte top instead</li>
      <li>Got this for my sister and she LOVES LOVE LOVES it.</li>
      <li>Love the matte finish</li>
      <li>and I love the look of the matte with them.  </li>
      <li>I got a lovely gray, and I thought it would look fabulous matte.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>After a couple days of wear, it had lost even more of its matte effect from absorbing skin oils &amp; hand lotion, I&#x27;m guessing.</li>
      <li>One thing to be sure of is that it is done very evenly.</li>
      <li>Ok because it can make any color/polish &amp;#34;matte-looking&amp;#34; but it comes out thick and looks/feels like you have scotch magic tape on your nails (THAT kind of matte).</li>
      <li>A bit more challenging to use because you need to put it on very carefully and smoothly.</li>
      <li>I bought this with very high hopes!</li>
      <li>Other than that, I love it!</li>
      <li>The matte topcoat was exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>But my coworker used it to get a black french manicure, and it looks pretty good!</li>
      <li>it won&#x27;t show matte until after you clean the nail with acetone after your gel process is complete.</li>
      <li>It does certainly take the shine off of your shellac mani.</li>
      <li>But not quite as much as you are probably expecting it to.</li>
      <li>I expected more from OPI.</li>
      <li>I use mostly sheer or light colors</li>
      <li>It does show imperfections very well.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really leave the nail matte like the regular opi top coat more of a dull glossy coat</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a satin finish, not really matte, and within 2 days, though for a woman it might have been OK, it had gained an embarrassingly silky sheen, to the point that I had - as with all top coats - to dull it down with a fine</li>
      <li>This was decent enough</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been needing for male manicures, especially for brittle or damaged nails.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not totally disappointed, but I&#x27;m not thrilled.</li>
      <li>Bummer that it wasn&#x27;t more dramatic of a look</li>

<li> : it will still be shiny until you dry the final coat and wipe off the gunk with alcohol/polish remover.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not nearly as matte as you would think.</li>
<li> Also, be careful about the colors you chose.</li>
<li> When used on black polish it turned grey.  </li>
<li> It was some what matte, but as the other reviewer said, it is like scotch tape.</li>
<li> I shall use the supplier again for other gel products - but not for this one.</li>
<li> The black shows all imperfections.</li>
<li> Polish was solid in the jar(it did not move) and the wand was broken off.</li>
<li> Took the matte topcoat to my nail salon &amp; had the manicurist use it over my usual gel polish color.</li>
<li> This product works but the matte effect fades after about 3 days which is unacceptable for my clients who are paying for sets they wear for at least 2 weeks.</li>
<li> You need to rub it with alcohol to make them matte, I&#x27;m not very happy with it.</li>
<li> was terrific, the product arriving in Scotland days before the time forecast, however when it went on I was disappointed.</li>
<li> The product was unusable.garbage Not happy</li>
<li> Arrived dried out and unusable :(</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> As I use gel to reinforce and protect my severely split nails, I was delighted that OPI had produced a matte top coat... \\&quot;sparkly shiny\\&quot; isn&#x27;t a very male thing!&lt;br /&gt;The service was terrific, the product arriving in Scotland days before the time forecast, however when it went on I was disappointed. It&#x27;s a satin finish, not really matte, and within 2 days, though for a woman it might have been OK, it had gained an embarrassingly silky sheen, to the point that I had - as with all top coats - to dull it down with a fine file.&lt;br /&gt;A shame because it was a good price, even with delivery to Scotland, and very quick. I shall use the supplier again for other gel products - but not for this one.</li>
    <li> Ok because it can make any color/polish &amp;#34;matte-looking&amp;#34; but it comes out thick and looks/feels like you have scotch magic tape on your nails (THAT kind of matte).</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really leave the nail matte like the regular opi top coat more of a dull glossy coat</li>
    <li> This was decent enough but I think overall, OPI products are just too over priced</li>
    <li> Polish was solid in the jar(it did not move) and the wand was broken off. The product was unusable.garbage Not happy</li>
    <li> I use mostly sheer or light colors and I love the look of the matte with them.  It does matte even further after a day&#x27;s wear so I don&#x27;t get the complaints about it not being matte enough.  You could just rub the nail with a piece of paper to soften the shine if it bothers you but I don&#x27;t find it a problem.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been way over an hour and the polish is still tacky.</li>
    <li> Love OPI! All of their polishes work well to me. The matte topcoat was exactly what I needed. I take it to the salon with me when I want something different.</li>
    <li> When used on black polish it turned grey.  It was some what matte, but as the other reviewer said, it is like scotch tape.</li>
    <li> It works for a day or two but then the matte effect wears off and the color goes back to shiny.</li>
    <li> Got this for my sister and she LOVES LOVE LOVES it. One coat makes it semi matte and 2 makes it matte.</li>
    <li> This is one of the 10 items I bought for my niece as a gift replicating a giveaway. She loves it.</li>
    <li> This product works but the matte effect fades after about 3 days which is unacceptable for my clients who are paying for sets they wear for at least 2 weeks. You need to rub it with alcohol to make them matte, I&#x27;m not very happy with it.</li>
    <li> It does give a matte finish, but I realized that I needed to wipe off the residue before i could see it.  It does show imperfections very well.  A bit more challenging to use because you need to put it on very carefully and smoothly.</li>
    <li> I bought this with very high hopes! It does certainly take the shine off of your shellac mani. But not quite as much as you are probably expecting it to. I wanted MATTE nails. This makes them more of a satin finish. I&#x27;m not totally disappointed, but I&#x27;m not thrilled. I expected more from OPI. Also, be careful about the colors you chose. I got a lovely gray, and I thought it would look fabulous matte. It looks like a drab tanish-greyish color that I would expect my grandmother to have worn in the 80s. But my coworker used it to get a black french manicure, and it looks pretty good! Lower your expectations if you&#x27;re going to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: it will still be shiny until you dry the final coat and wipe off the gunk with alcohol/polish remover.</li>
    <li> Not as matte as I&#x27;d like, but works! Easy to use.</li>
    <li> dont buy this version, use the orly matte top instead, i just left this bottle un-use for about a 1 month and it now condensed and solid, cannot be use anymore.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been needing for male manicures, especially for brittle or damaged nails.  I&#x27;m delighted with this product!</li>
    <li> The key to this product...it won&#x27;t show matte until after you clean the nail with acetone after your gel process is complete. For a moment my nail tech was scared it didn&#x27;t work. But all was good in the end. One thing to be sure of is that it is done very evenly. The black shows all imperfections. Other than that, I love it!</li>
    <li> Arrived dried out and unusable :(</li>
    <li> Awesome!!! Love the matte finish</li>
    <li> Works great awesome product</li>
    <li> Took the matte topcoat to my nail salon &amp; had the manicurist use it over my usual gel polish color. It&#x27;s not nearly as matte as you would think. It&#x27;s basically half-matte - similar to the finish of a semi-gloss paint. After a couple days of wear, it had lost even more of its matte effect from absorbing skin oils &amp; hand lotion, I&#x27;m guessing. Bummer that it wasn&#x27;t more dramatic of a look - it kinda seemed like a regular glossy manicure had \\&quot;faded\\&quot;, if that makes sense.</li>
