      <li>Maybelline New York Dream Matte Powder is amazing!</li>
      <li>I bought it for my wife and she was very happy with this purchase,  arrived in time with two other goods too</li>
      <li>Light weight powder</li>
      <li>Soooooo happy that I finally found this product.</li>
      <li>It feels light on your face, you don&#x27;t even feel it.</li>
      <li>It provides a smooth look and covers blemishes easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>that i just wear foundation and concealer) and am still on my first one since i bought it in August!!</li>
      <li>It lightens up my forehead wonderfully and a little pat on my nose dimishes the shine immediately!</li>
      <li>I was so excited when I found that out.</li>
      <li>It lasts me a long time and is a great product.</li>
      <li>Using this powder is also the first time I&#x27;ve ever been able to look flawless from 10AM to 10PM with ZERO touchups, and I&#x27;m someone who has to cover serious hyperpigmentation and scars.</li>
      <li>Love this powder, doesn&#x27;t give much coverage but keeps me matte and doesn&#x27;t give you cake-face.</li>
      <li>I was a little worried the Honey (medium) tone would be too dark for my fair skin, but it turned out to be perfect.</li>
      <li>I heard such rave reviews for this, nine color line, I purchased four different shades &amp; beige was the best match.</li>
      <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
      <li>Quick processing and delivery.</li>
      <li>I am not someone who is very skilled at makeup, so it&#x27;s a big deal that I&#x27;ve found a process now</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite go to powder for touch ups during the day.</li>
      <li>Item as described and fast shipping!!  </li>
      <li>Dust whole face again with clean blush brush and/or add any finishing touches you may desire.</li>
      <li>Definitely will buy another one of this, because i love it.</li>
      <li>This is powder I can use without liquid or thick &amp;#34;powder foundations.&amp;#34; I use concealer under my eyes and then this goes on all over, feel great after that.</li>
      <li>Moderate coverage, easy to use and apply</li>
      <li>Ended up being too light, even though it looked like the perfect color online:(</li>
      <li>;) highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>So I really don&#x27;t use this product that much.</li>
      <li>And a light swipe on both cheeks instantly evens out my forehead and nose</li>
      <li>Only thing is that the color seems light, I have to go a shade darker for my medium skin tone.</li>
      <li>liberally apply matte powder (really go for it, get chalky with it, don&#x27;t be scared, cover every inch),</li>
      <li>It is a very lightweight powder that stays on all day.</li>
      <li>I have really oily skin</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Sand and Honey are usually tones for people with medium/medium light complexion, but these are way too light.</li>
      <li>The whole process takes 5 to 10 minutes and almost looks like a professional did it, and everything looks fresh and natural all day.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I wore this product for the first time.</li>
      <li>Always thought more expensive means better product.</li>
      <li>She always wore Maybelline since high school</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the little surprise I got when I opened it</li>
      <li>Some of my coworkers said \\&quot;Wow your makeup looks really perfect!,\\&quot; 2 days in a row.</li>
      <li>, i normally used mac or clinique</li>
      <li>The new powder leaves face like wearing clay.</li>
      <li>To my shock and amazement, I have gotten multiple compliments on my makeup for the first time in my life, and I&#x27;m 27.</li>
      <li>No matter how much I seem to use day to day, the pots last way longer than the Mac powders, and these get my face super \\&quot;matte\\&quot; just like the more expensive stuff.</li>
      <li>perfert for my skin tone and makes my skin look so soft.</li>
      <li>Maybelline really needs to bring Dream Matt back into production!!!</li>
      <li>It is a bit on the dry side for me, or a very powdery affect.</li>

<ol>
    <li> Keeps my skin matte for a very long time.</li>
    <li> I only use this product for my black heads to cover them up. So I really don&#x27;t use this product that much.</li>
    <li> Love it! Perfect color! Perfect! Not oiley at all!</li>
    <li> great covrr up for scars !</li>
    <li> I have been buying this for years and hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it. It is a very lightweight powder that stays on all day.</li>
    <li> I was so sad when they discontinued my favorite  face powder but ecstatic that I can always find it here. Quick processing and delivery. Very satisfied with this purchase. Thanks.</li>
    <li> It is always a crap shoot when ordering make up on line.&lt;br /&gt;This Maybelline New York Dream Matte Powder, Honey, Medium 3-4, 0.32 Ounce was perfect.</li>
    <li> Ever since Maybelline has discontinued this holy grail powder foundation, I&#x27;ve been on a spree to pick up as many as I can find. There is no replacement or substitution for the finish, feel, and look of this powder. I miss it.</li>
    <li> Love this powder, doesn&#x27;t give much coverage but keeps me matte and doesn&#x27;t give you cake-face. Only thing is that the color seems light, I have to go a shade darker for my medium skin tone.</li>
    <li> Wife says its not that good...I guess Maybelline stop selling the type of foundation she used for years...this did not replace.</li>
    <li> Love love love it, perfert for my skin tone and makes my skin look so soft. Simply makes my skin flawless~</li>
    <li> Love this matte powder</li>
    <li> My wife loves it and I do too.</li>
    <li> Good and timely delivery.</li>
    <li> Came in several shades lighter then the same color store bought so pretty disappointed since I bought multiples that I won&#x27;t be able to use all summer</li>
    <li> I think the product works for me when I want to cut down on shine when I wear foundation. I do not know if it would work well for me if I wore this product without foundation.</li>
    <li> It does not cover well, and it&#x27;s pigment does not match the description. I would not buy it again. It makes me pale,and it doesn&#x27;t stay on all day.</li>
    <li> Ended up being too light, even though it looked like the perfect color online:(</li>
    <li> I love this powder. Maybelline discontinued it. I tried their replacement product--Wonder Powder--it is awful. It cakes up too thickly. Maybelline really needs to bring Dream Matt back into production!!!</li>
    <li> I love it. This power is so so amazing  and this work great with any skin . love it !!!</li>
    <li> Soooooo happy that I finally found this product. It is sooo perfect for my skin. I was pleasantly surprised when I wore this product for the first time. It kept my skin matte for almost the entire day while the products I used earlier could not even do for few hours.</li>
    <li> I like to apply it with a brush after using some tinted moisturizer. It creates a nice matte finish but I do need to apply it a couple times throughout the day because I like in Florida (hello humid weather) and my face is kind of oily. For the price, this is a very good matte powder.</li>
    <li> Love this makeup. It provides a smooth look and covers blemishes easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very sad that this was discontinued.</li>
    <li> As an African American, I often have been frustrated with powders that give a chalky look, but I think I will be using this as my exclusive powder (instead of expensive mac blot powder) for a very long time. This is because you can apply the powder lightly or heavily, and after 10 minutes it just disappears on its own and sets your foundation, giving you an insanely flawless finish. I can even use this same product in the whiter tones, because they all do the same thing - set and disappear, so your foundation color is all you see. To my shock and amazement, I have gotten multiple compliments on my makeup for the first time in my life, and I&#x27;m 27. Some people have said things like \\&quot;You look so refreshed!\\&quot;. Some of my coworkers said \\&quot;Wow your makeup looks really perfect!,\\&quot; 2 days in a row. Using this powder is also the first time I&#x27;ve ever been able to look flawless from 10AM to 10PM with ZERO touchups, and I&#x27;m someone who has to cover serious hyperpigmentation and scars. I didn&#x27;t even know it was possible. No matter how much I seem to use day to day, the pots last way longer than the Mac powders, and these get my face super \\&quot;matte\\&quot; just like the more expensive stuff. I am not someone who is very skilled at makeup, so it&#x27;s a big deal that I&#x27;ve found a process now that makes me look perfect. Here&#x27;s what I do: 1. apply under-eye concealer, 2. apply foundation liberally, 3. apply contour colors if desired, 4. liberally apply matte powder (really go for it, get chalky with it, don&#x27;t be scared, cover every inch), 5. apply blush, eyeshadow, and mascara, 6. Dust whole face again with clean blush brush and/or add any finishing touches you may desire. My skin color changes with the seasons, so sometimes I finish the look by very lightly dusting on a mineral power that matches my skintone. The whole process takes 5 to 10 minutes and almost looks like a professional did it, and everything looks fresh and natural all day. I know that everyone&#x27;s skin responds differently to different products and processes, but this is what works for my slightly oily skin.</li>
    <li> Great product, I am no longer able to buy at any stores in town so I had to stock up and buy a ton. Love this product as it does not leave your face greasy as most others do for me.</li>
    <li> I have this matte powder in fair light 0-1, but i&#x27;ll review anyways. I&#x27;m reviewing from my dad&#x27;s accoutnt. I put this on after my foundation and it works amazingly!!! It lightens up my forehead wonderfully and a little pat on my nose dimishes the shine immediately! And a light swipe on both cheeks instantly evens out my forehead and nose so i really love this product!! Since i have yellowy skin, i was skeptical when i bought this. I didn&#x27;t know if my shade which was Fair again, would ruin my skin color and make me turn out like a two toned freak, but it workd out perfectly! I shall be trying out this color as soon as i can!</li>
    <li> I heard such rave reviews for this, nine color line, I purchased four different shades &amp; beige was the best match. It is a bit on the dry side for me, or a very powdery affect. Moderate coverage, easy to use and apply</li>
    <li> It is very good but the product but went very clear that my skin looked in the photo of my color</li>
    <li> Maybelline New York Dream Matte Powder is amazing! It almost perfectly fits my skintone and lasts me a long time! I use this foundation almost every day(being that i just wear foundation and concealer) and am still on my first one since i bought it in August!! It lasts me a long time and is a great product. Also when I first started using it, I thought it would come with an applicant to apply to the product but was sad to find out it didnt): but after dropping it(and it not breaking!!!!!) the bottom slid out to reveal a mirror and an applicator.. I really love this!</li>
    <li> This foundation is great...came sealed in package.  Blends in well and matches my tone of skin.  Item as described and fast shipping!!  A++++++</li>
    <li> Its my moms favorite makeup.She always wore Maybelline since high school its the best.Hopefully the stores sells dream matte powder again. The new powder leaves face like wearing clay.Stores should sell dream matte again and never change.</li>
    <li> I love this. Perfect color for fair skin that has some color from the Florida sun (not tan, though), as opposed to when I lived in Boston and used lighter colors. I don&#x27;t use a lot of makeup and in humid Florida, foundation liquid just is no good, alone or with powder This is powder I can use without liquid or thick &amp;#34;powder foundations.&amp;#34; I use concealer under my eyes and then this goes on all over, feel great after that. Will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife and she was very happy with this purchase,  arrived in time with two other goods too</li>
    <li> This powder is a perfect finish to my liquid foundation.  It goes on so light, but the effect is gorgeous; it makes my liquid foundation look airbrushed and flawless.  It has very little color so it will match nearly any skin tone, but it makes all the difference as a setting-powder - it has become an irreplacable part of my makeup routine. It also has the most wonderful satiny feel. Love love love it!</li>
    <li> Definitely will buy another one of this, because i love it. I have really oily skin and this help me with that problem, i normally used mac or clinique but i have to put about 2 or 3 times depending if how busy i am which i hate touching up alot. But this i have to used it once then a lil bit touch up in the end of the day and im good to go ;) highly recommend it. Love it!</li>
    <li> Sand and Honey are usually tones for people with medium/medium light complexion, but these are way too light. Shipping was quick.</li>
    <li> Love this powder. It&#x27;s the only one yet that I don&#x27;t have to apply every hour.</li>
    <li> Light weight powder but just enough to give you eveness... Could not be happier!!</li>
    <li> I was a little worried the Honey (medium) tone would be too dark for my fair skin, but it turned out to be perfect. The color isn&#x27;t near as dark or pink looking as it is on the product image. This powder goes on very smooth and doesn&#x27;t look chalky. I can&#x27;t tell a big difference as far as keeping shine down as compared to other powders I&#x27;ve used, but I never really can. It&#x27;s definitely no worse than usual. I&#x27;d definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Love this powder. It matches my skin perfectly. Goes on well with full coverage, and lasts a good while. It&#x27;s my new favorite go to powder for touch ups during the day.</li>
    <li> Hello C: ,&lt;br /&gt;  This product is amazing! It feels light on your face, you don&#x27;t even feel it. I LOVE the little surprise I got when I opened it, I had NO idea it came with a mirror and a little pad/applier. On the side it has a swinging motion, you open that up and BOOM! there it is pad/applier, lift that up, mini mirror. I was so excited when I found that out. when you get those packages, whatever it may be, it feels like Christmas. (: I recommend this product to everybody (:</li>
    <li> Must have in my make up case. Combats oiliness. Incredible coverage. Excellent product. Always thought more expensive means better product. That&#x27;s not the case. Highly recommend.</li>
