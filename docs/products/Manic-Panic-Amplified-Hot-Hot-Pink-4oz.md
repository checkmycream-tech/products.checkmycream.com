      <li>Love, love, love.  </li>
      <li>Manic Panic is AWESOME hair dye, but I&#x27;m unsure of why this seller is asking for almost TWICE what you&#x27;d pay at your local Sally Beauty Supply store.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s more of a bottle.  </li>
      <li>I love to dye my hair this color in the summer.</li>
      <li>Stays saturated in hair for longer than most Manic Panic colors.</li>
      <li>I love the color of this dye.</li>
      <li>Perfect,the color i have always wanted,&lt;br /&gt;the amplified formula has better effect ,stays longer and vibrate color</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think leaving it in longer makes it more bright, but I think it makes the staying power MUCH longer.  </li>
      <li>I think these fun colors are adorable no matter my age!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m super happy with my results, You should give Manic Panic a try ;)</li>
      <li>It will come out bright and won&#x27;t fade fast.</li>
      <li>Nice stuff, worth the additional money if you&#x27;re planning to have your color in for a while.  </li>
      <li>Manic Panic is easy to apply - just apply the color where you want it, leave it</li>
      <li>really happy and will buy more in the future.</li>
      <li>A very quick scrub with handsoap will prevent stain.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a continued fan and loved finding these (the older packaging) on Amazon for cheaper than the MP website</li>
      <li>It goes on strong and stays strong.</li>
      <li>and it came out a beautiful deep purple and faded to lavender.</li>
      <li>Granted, I&#x27;m blonde, so the color shows up great</li>
      <li>I bleached that hair to light blond</li>
      <li>even he said that it was not noticeable until I stepped into the light.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great, it definitely doesn&#x27;t wreck your hair at all.  </li>
      <li>Now I order it on line to keep the color fresh!  </li>
      <li>and I was familiar with this product from the punk rock 80s.  </li>
      <li>I also love that it is healthy for your hair since it is made of natural ingredients.  </li>
      <li>This hot pink came out very bright and didn&#x27;t fade until about the 10th wash.</li>
      <li>wow this looks amazing, but i havent purchased it</li>
      <li>It lasts much longer than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried, it&#x27;s easy application makes re-touches &amp;#34;cake&amp;#34;, and the colors are bold and brilliant.</li>
      <li>It will turn any bold shade of Manic Panic into a subdued pastel.)</li>
      <li>Also, color stays much more vibrant if you add some dye to your conditioner.</li>
      <li>Love this color, I had voodoo blue and added this on top</li>
      <li>If you want seriously bright pink hair, just recolor it when it begins to fade.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i just love the old packaging the jar not the bottle</li>
      <li>And will fade but it is a fun product.</li>
      <li>first cause its dark, and it looked great the first couple of days, but quickly faded once I had to wash my hair.</li>
      <li>If people are not getting the right result then leave it in your hair longer than 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Definitely brighter and longer-lasting than the original Manic Panic line, but just as easy to use.  </li>
      <li>when I go to the gym and sweat on the treadmill, I am not at my most attractive, what with pink streaks going down my face and neck...</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t super picky and wanted a more fluid/ gradient look, but that would be different if you were doing your whole head.  </li>
      <li>Perfect color, long lasting (especially for a red/pink which always fade quickly from my hair).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very vivid bright pink.</li>
      <li>The Hot Hot Pink in particular is brilliant; I&#x27;ve been toning it with a little bit of purple, and it makes a stunning magenta that you can see from across the room.  </li>
      <li>First of all - USE GLOVES.  </li>
      <li>First of all, the bottle doesn&#x27;t look like the tub in the photo</li>
      <li>have never dyed my hair or anything like that, so the first time I was nervous.  </li>
      <li>When I received the bottles of it, I was concerned at first</li>
      <li>thanks!</li>
      <li>(Still pretty.)</li>
      <li>I love the variety of colors in the \\&quot;Amplified\\&quot; collection, which last longer and have more pigment than the regular Manic Panic.  </li>
      <li>Following the directions of many that I came across, I did not follow the directions on the package in regards to time.</li>
      <li>thing I want to mention is that the manic panic is VERY conditioning!  </li>
      <li>Deep rich color that holds!  </li>
      <li>lol Expect to turn your towel pink - for the next couple of washes.</li>
      <li>An extremely intense pink color that goes on smoothly and easily.</li>
      <li>My favorite color is Hot Hot Pink because I don&#x27;t have to bleach my hair</li>
      <li>It is very vibrant and it stays in for over 3 - 4 weeks.</li>
      <li>First I bleached my hair to a medium/light golden blonde, rinse, and then apply this color right after while my hair is damp.</li>
      <li>The third time it was in for almost 24 hours (this was two days ago, my hair is totally fine).  </li>
      <li>Everyone tells me how much they like it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s even a spot where they show what the hair color looks like on real people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Then I rinsed it really well in the sink.  </li>
      <li>This stuff gets everywhere and stains fast.  </li>
      <li>After the first application of about 6 inches worth of my kind of thin hair, I had used up maybe 1/5th of the bottle.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because I wish it would stay just a bit longer, a month maybe?it pink, but if you do a cursory clean right after you are done rinsing</li>
      <li>the color will be a very dark, muted pink - still attractive but not</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s MUCH easier to color the second time, since you most likely will only have to apply the color - not bleach.</li>
      <li>As for the shower/ sink, it will get it s bit pink, but if you do a cursory clean right after you are done rinsing (I simply wipe it with a baby wipe), all the dye comes off.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I put some bleach streaks in my hair and then painted on the Manic Panic, let it sit for an hour,washed it out,and I have these dark pink highlights that look really great, especially in the sunlight.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Manic Panic is AWESOME hair dye, but I&#x27;m unsure of why this seller is asking for almost TWICE what you&#x27;d pay at your local Sally Beauty Supply store. Several people have also left reviews that they received the gel (bottle) formula rather than the cream (jar) that is pictured, and there is a big difference in how those two products perform. Manic Panic cream formula usually costs $9.99 at Sally Beauty Supply and they always have a wide range of colors, so save yourself the headache and just visit your local shop.</li>
    <li> its really bright, had to bleach my hair first cause its dark, and it looked great the first couple of days, but quickly faded once I had to wash my hair.</li>
    <li> This is the second of the two colors that I am dying my hair. I also used the Purple Haze, and I have to tell you that this is amazing! Following the directions of many that I came across, I did not follow the directions on the package in regards to time. I am dyeing weave and I bleached the weave from a dark/auburn blond to an almost platinum blond and then applied the dye and left it on for 1 1/2 hours. I rinsed it off and I was so surprised at how seriously pink it was. It is absolutely fabulous! I have used Splat! blue dye in the past and it turned out way, way too dark and for that matter the dye continued to drip after the hair was rinsed because the dye would never run off the hair. I was so disappointed because the only one that figured out my hair was blue was my supervisor and even he said that it was not noticeable until I stepped into the light. I bleached that hair to light blond and it came out too dark. But this product does everything it claims. If people are not getting the right result then leave it in your hair longer than 30 minutes. I know people say that the dye should not dry in your hair but I allowed the dye to start drying in the hair and then rinsed with warm water, then used Herbal Essence shampoo and that got the rest of the dye out. I am so stoked about this product and I have been converted! Buy this, you will not be mad. Just leave it in longer and you will have the hot pink color!</li>
    <li> I love the color of this dye. It is very vibrant and it stays in for over 3 - 4 weeks. I got the dye very quickly and I was very impressed with the service. Thank You. : )</li>
    <li> The product arrived with the safety seal broken, dried and crusted dye around the lip of the bottle, and a noticeable amount of hair dye missing.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love.  Perfect color, long lasting (especially for a red/pink which always fade quickly from my hair).</li>
    <li> Stays saturated in hair for longer than most Manic Panic colors. Starts out almost a deep fuchsia color then fades to a rich hot pink over about 2-3 weeks, if you let it sit over night (for like 8 hours) before washing it out. Also, color stays much more vibrant if you add some dye to your conditioner. Would definitely recommend bleaching the area to dye first. This dye DOES make your hair feel very healthy and moisturized, even after bleaching.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair color dye ever!  I love the variety of colors in the \\&quot;Amplified\\&quot; collection, which last longer and have more pigment than the regular Manic Panic.  I also love that it is healthy for your hair since it is made of natural ingredients.  The Amplified Cotton Candy Pink is so pretty.  I mix it with a drop of Hot Hot Pink. First I bleached my hair to a medium/light golden blonde, rinse, and then apply this color right after while my hair is damp. It comes out with shine and all kinds of pink- orangey pink shades with the Cotton Candy color being the majority.  I love to dye my hair this color in the summer.</li>
    <li> My five year old wanted pink hair and I was familiar with this product from the punk rock 80s.  The product is potent but best to remember this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) bleach the area you want to got hot pink or else the color will be a very dark, muted pink - still attractive but not hot.&lt;br /&gt;2) don&#x27;t forget to coat your forehead, ears, neck, etc with vaseline.  This stuff gets everywhere and stains fast.  A very quick scrub with handsoap will prevent stain.&lt;br /&gt;3) have an old towel because it will ruin your drying towel.. it will also stain all porcelain.</li>
    <li> wow this looks amazing, but i havent purchased it can anyone tell me what it will do to black hair? i cannot bleach it or lighten it.  thanks!</li>
    <li> Definitely brighter and longer-lasting than the original Manic Panic line, but just as easy to use.  Nice stuff, worth the additional money if you&#x27;re planning to have your color in for a while.  The Hot Hot Pink in particular is brilliant; I&#x27;ve been toning it with a little bit of purple, and it makes a stunning magenta that you can see from across the room.  Really excellent product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using manic panic for over 15 years (ouch- this shows my age!) and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed.  Granted, I&#x27;m blonde, so the color shows up great every time- I think you need a color stripper if you have dark hair, but the color faded really slowly and looked fantastic the entire time- even as it faded!  Everyone loved it and I got tons of compliments.  Try it out- you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Manic Panic Amplified rocks!  Deep rich color that holds!  Be sure to use a sulfate free shampoo!  I had the salon bleach the bottom half of my hair and my &amp;#34;under&amp;#34; bangs and they used Manic Panic.  Now I order it on line to keep the color fresh!  Easy to do!  Make sure you have rubber gloves and a shirt or robe you don&#x27;t care about.  I section my hair into 4  goop it on and wrap it in foil.  Then I set up the bathroom heater and sit by it for half an hour!  Works like a charm!</li>
    <li> An extremely intense pink color that goes on smoothly and easily. I have medium dark hair so I bleached before applying. (I used Manic Panic&#x27;s Amplified Bleach. If you are doing a lot of hair, or your hair is long, I would get 2 bleach kits if you are using this particular brand.) Manic Panic is easy to apply - just apply the color where you want it, leave it (I left it for about an hour), rinse out. And rinse out. And rinse out. lol Expect to turn your towel pink - for the next couple of washes. The less you wash your hair, the longer it stays. After a few washes, this color will turn a nice shade of pastel pink. (Still pretty.) If you want seriously bright pink hair, just recolor it when it begins to fade. It&#x27;s MUCH easier to color the second time, since you most likely will only have to apply the color - not bleach. Right after coloring, be careful - ANYTIME your hair gets wet, the color WILL run. (It will also get under your nails when you scratch your head.) These minor annoyances don&#x27;t bother me enough to stop using Manic Panic...but I would want to know this stuff before I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: Manic Panic is the BEST product out there for coloring your hair funky shades. It lasts much longer than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried, it&#x27;s easy application makes re-touches &amp;#34;cake&amp;#34;, and the colors are bold and brilliant. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to use this brand, or color, again. You definitely make a statement! (If you want a pastel shade to begin with, buy their Pastel-izer. It will turn any bold shade of Manic Panic into a subdued pastel.) ManicPanic.com is full of awesome information and great tips. There&#x27;s even a spot where they show what the hair color looks like on real people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best part? The don&#x27;t test any of their products on animals. YAY!</li>
    <li> Love this color, I had voodoo blue and added this on top and it came out a beautiful deep purple and faded to lavender. It still fades faster than blue hair dye, but for a reddish color it lasts longer than any other hot pink hair dye I&#x27;ve tried. Leave it on for a few hours, over night if possible on bleached hair and it should really pop, more like a neon pink/magenta than a bubble gum pink. I haven&#x27;t seen it under a black light, I just bought it for being a pink that lasts.</li>
    <li> I love it! I put some bleach streaks in my hair and then painted on the Manic Panic, let it sit for an hour,washed it out,and I have these dark pink highlights that look really great, especially in the sunlight. Everyone tells me how much they like it!&lt;br /&gt;I love that the product is vegan!&lt;br /&gt;I did have to delete one star tho, because the stuff is a mess. Bathtub is now pink, and I am a renter...&lt;br /&gt;and when I go to the gym and sweat on the treadmill, I am not at my most attractive, what with pink streaks going down my face and neck...Yikes it bleeds out forever!&lt;br /&gt;BUT I love the look and I now want to try other colors.&lt;br /&gt;In case anyone is wondering, I am over 30,and I think these fun colors are adorable no matter my age!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Manic Panic on bleached and unbleached hair from 1 to 8 colors on my head for years. I&#x27;m a continued fan and loved finding these (the older packaging) on Amazon for cheaper than the MP website</li>
    <li> This is one of the best colors by Manic Panic. It goes on strong and stays strong. It&#x27;s a very vivid bright pink. It looks darker and redder in the jar than it is on one&#x27;s hair, so don&#x27;t let the way it looks in the jar fool you. A great color if you want to be seen from a mile away!</li>
    <li> i used this dye on my sisters hair and we both agree that it is beautiful. its a bright yet elegant color and we didnt even use half the bottle. really happy and will buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been using Manic Panic on my hair for about 6 years, bleached and not bleached. My favorite color is Hot Hot Pink because I don&#x27;t have to bleach my hair (See Picture, also..I&#x27;m a strawberry blonde..I kept the color in for 12 hours), and it&#x27;s a beautiful color. I have also used Atomic Turquoise which is another favorite, I bleached my hair for A.T. Manic Panic is an awesome Vegan dye that makes your hair soft and POP! with amazing colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I will mention is that I was expecting to receive the jar of Manic Panic..When I received the bottles of it, I was concerned at first but it worked out perfectly. I&#x27;m super happy with my results, You should give Manic Panic a try ;)</li>
    <li> I love manic panic&#x27;s colors, they always turn out perfect. This hot pink came out very bright and didn&#x27;t fade until about the 10th wash. Its a stain so it doesn&#x27;t damage your hair, when using I recommend leaving it in for an hour or until your hair is completely dry. It will come out bright and won&#x27;t fade fast.</li>
    <li> Works great on light hair. And will fade but it is a fun product. Does stain hands and tiles so be mindful of that.</li>
    <li> Perfect,the color i have always wanted,&lt;br /&gt;the amplified formula has better effect ,stays longer and vibrate color&lt;br /&gt;i just love the old packaging the jar not the bottle</li>
    <li> I have dirty blonde/ dark blonde hair naturally, so I didn&#x27;t bleach my hair at all.  I also only dyed the bottom 6-8 inches of my very long straight hair, going for a ombre look.  First of all, the bottle doesn&#x27;t look like the tub in the photo, it&#x27;s more of a bottle.  I believe it is still 4 ounces though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never dyed my hair or anything like that, so the first time I was nervous.  First of all - USE GLOVES.  I braided my hair in sections and applied the dye to my hair ends with my hand, working through the locks of hair to make sure to get it on most of the hair.  I wasn&#x27;t super picky and wanted a more fluid/ gradient look, but that would be different if you were doing your whole head.  After the first application of about 6 inches worth of my kind of thin hair, I had used up maybe 1/5th of the bottle.  After reading other reviews and watching some video reviews on youtube, I decided to let it sit in my hair for about 4 hours.  Then I rinsed it really well in the sink.  IT WAS REALLY BRIGHT!  I loved it!  I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, probably every 3 days, and it started fading noticeably after 1.5 - 2 weeks.  The second time I dyed it, I did the same process, only I left the dye in overnight.  The third time it was in for almost 24 hours (this was two days ago, my hair is totally fine).  I don&#x27;t think leaving it in longer makes it more bright, but I think it makes the staying power MUCH longer.  After the second application it was probably like 75% gone after 3 weeks (of washing 2x a week).  Keep in mind I have unbleached, virgin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I want to mention is that the manic panic is VERY conditioning!  It&#x27;s great, it definitely doesn&#x27;t wreck your hair at all.  Also, lots of reviews mention the mess... Maybe it&#x27;s different because only the bottom half of my hair is dyed, or maybe people aren&#x27;t rinsing it thoroughly, but I have not had a problem with dyed towels, sheets, clothes, etc.  As for the shower/ sink, it will get it s bit pink, but if you do a cursory clean right after you are done rinsing (I simply wipe it with a baby wipe), all the dye comes off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would recommend this product, although I have nothing to compare it to.  I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because I wish it would stay just a bit longer, a month maybe?it pink, but if you do a cursory clean right after you are done rinsing (I simply wipe it with a baby wipe), all the dye comes off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would recommend this product, although I have nothing to compare it to.  I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because I wish it would stay just a bit longer, a month maybe?</li>
