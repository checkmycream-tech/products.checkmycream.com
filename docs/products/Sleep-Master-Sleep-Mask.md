<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have owned this sleep mask for a few years now. Initially, I only used it on the rare occasion that I had bad migraine, which for me, can cause severe sensitivity to light. I also use it whenever traveling as you never quite know how much light will shine through your hotel window. Most recently, I&#x27;ve tried to use it on nights that I wake up a lot. I must be a light sleeper and having the mask on my face just seems to help me stay asleep or go back to sleep quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s stays on your face/head! I pull my hair in a ponytail and then wrap this around my face, securing with the velcro attached at the ends. You can adjust how you need to, but as long as it&#x27;s reasonably secure, it doesn&#x27;t slide off, which is a problem I&#x27;ve had with skimpier face masks with the skinny elastic band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This is a quality product. It&#x27;s well made and seems very durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The fabric fully covers your under eye area because of the cut above the nose on the mask. So it really does fit snuggly against your face and block out any light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - I&#x27;ve only recently discovered this during a Texas spring where humidity runs high. I wake up kind of hot in this mask now that it&#x27;s warming up outside, even if we have the a/c on. Maybe this company makes the same mask with a cooler fabric for warm months. I&#x27;m not sure...have not checked. I still use it and just remove it if I get too hot. But if you&#x27;re using this regularly and need it for something like daytime sleeping, you might consider this.</li>
    <li> Best sleep I&#x27;ve had in a while</li>
    <li> This was one of the worst sleep masks I&#x27;ve ever had.  It goes over your ears but the fabric that is inside as the filler, is LOUD.  It crinkles all night, I mean ALL NIGHT... it does block out the sun, and is comfortable, but it constantly woke me up with the crinkling over my ears.  I&#x27;ve thought of maybe sewing some flannel fabric on the inside to decrease the sound, maybe I&#x27;ll do that when I pick up sewing :P haha</li>
    <li> They are fantastic, however they need to be a little longer in back.</li>
    <li> I have used many a sleep mask and this is one of the better ones.  However, for the price I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a great value.  My main complaint would be that it doesn&#x27;t stay in place well.  The satin fabric is nice but it&#x27;s a bit slippery and the mask tends to slide around.</li>
    <li> I use it every night, i use it every time i nap. This has made my sleep better and makes me fall asleep faster. It&#x27;s high quality and can withstand my night tumblings. I love this mask and recommend everyone who wants a good mask get this!</li>
    <li> I work night shift so I use this to help me sleep. The silk material sometimes slips. I would only recommend if you do not move a lot in your sleep.</li>
    <li> Slides off your face.  Doesn&#x27;t fit snugly.</li>
    <li> I ordered three different sleep masks as a part of the research I am doing in sleep. The Sleep Master was my favorite of the three and was the one I took with me and used on a road trip from Kansas City to Los Angeles and back with my sister who uses a noisy CPAP. The mask is very effective in blocking out light but even with the earplugs, it didn&#x27;t block out all of the sound. In fact, I heard vague sounds from without and less vague noise from my own breathing and the blood beating on my eardrum. Still, it made it easier for me to sleep under somewhat adverse conditions.</li>
    <li> Very warm when sleeping. Also , after a few washes, the stuffing starts to poke through the fabric, making it feel &amp;#34;hairy&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this, as I work an occasional night and have trouble sleeping when there is light out.  At first, I was hopeful that the design would be better than a mask I bought at the corner drug store.  It wasn&#x27;t.  While the material is comfortable and I didn&#x27;t feel like it got too hot, it tends to slip.  Additionally, the nose is not well fitted, and tends to open up very large gaps, allowing lots of light in.  Probably it could be improved, but would need a fair amount of work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the padding over the ears, and the mask as a whole is quite comfortable.  Just doesn&#x27;t perform as well as masks that cost less than half the price.</li>
    <li> great full coverage of eyes lets in very little light; its probably not ideal for people with smaller heads. velcro is great for custom tightness. I&#x27;d definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> this is a fairly good size mask, feels comfortable, the only drawback for me personally&lt;br /&gt;is you may get to warm, as it almost can feel like a partial hat</li>
    <li> I love this eye mask! I really like that the fabric goes all the way around your head instead of just covering your eyes and being connected with a string- it makes it more comfortable. It does a great job of blocking out the light and also helps to minimize sound. A little pricier than most eye masks, but definitely worth it becuase it works great and will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Ok, I do but it has got one serious flaw. The material it is made out of, frays and the fraying, especially around the nose, is very bothersome. It feels like something is crawling on me and that is not good. Other than this serious flaw, this mask is great. I especially like how it covers my ears. It blocks out most of the light. Around the nose may take a little wearing in but once that is done the mask blocks out the light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helps.</li>
    <li> They looked a little big when I open them. But I tell you what they are the best. I work nights and need to cut out all light to sleep good. I tired so many other mast and none feel better, Stay in place better and cut out all light. Am very HAPPY with mine.</li>
    <li> Nice soft soothing material. Blocks out light beautifully, its taking some time to get used to it. The first couple weeks woke up with it at the foot of the bed but then I did the same thing to my mouth guard went I first started using it. I was happy I found a company that was willing to deliver it to my country (Canada), thank you for that. Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviews on two matters.  The design is such that to get it tight enough, you actually put intense pressure on your eyes themselves!  You wake up with painful eyes.  If not tight enough, it just slides off because it is so thick.  Second, I received NO sound \\&quot;muffling\\&quot; at all.  Mine did come with a pack of ear plugs  LOL  Was this the noise reduction benefit??&lt;br /&gt;As for blocking light, it is very good for that if you can keep it on.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see any benefit to this mask that ear plugs and a standard sleep mask don&#x27;t equal.</li>
    <li> Love this sleep mask.  I am a Very light sleeper.  The type that if I wake up at 4:00 AM and see any form of sunlight I cannot go back to sleep.  Same with any noise.  This sleep mask cuts out the light and some noise as well.  Easy velcro clasp, soft padded mask.  The only thing that may be an issue would be the summer months during which the mask could be too heavy and hot, unless someone has AC or a good fan on their face.</li>
    <li> Pros: soft and silky, lots of coverage, comfortable, adjustable velcro strap, excellent light blockage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: touches eyelids when wrapped, [without earplugs] loud due to rubbing against ears and while turning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Possible solutions: using Macks Dreamweaver Contoured Sleep Mask, the eyelid touching is not an issue anymore. As for the loudness I would have to wear ear plugs or earphones or just deal with it.</li>
    <li> This masks closes with velcro on the back, which pushes into the back of my head and makes me feel uncomfortable when I sleep. I often wake up finding that I took it off while sleeping without even realizing it. It is very hot since it doesn&#x27;t breathe at all, which adds to the discomfort. Finally, it doesn&#x27;t dampen then sound at all, instead it just warms up my ears and pushed them closer to my head for yet more discomfort. The complimentary sleeping masks I get when I fly do a better job than this mask. I wish I could return this poorly designed product.</li>
    <li> Nice, soft material, good stitching, adjusts easily and is comfortable. I bought it as a present for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;However, it is not revolutionary, it is not worth $25. There are no good alternatives right now so that&#x27;s why I went for this one. But come on, $25 seems wayy overpriced</li>
    <li> I am not sure what to say about this product. I mean It is very useful, but I am not so thrilled with it. I use it casually not daily. It bothers me a bit. It might be me.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, best sleep mask I ever bought. love it!</li>
    <li> this product is amazing. Now I can sleep better when I worked night shifts.</li>
    <li> This eye mask is a complete joke. The material is not breathable at all. I wake up sweating where on the mask area. It also catches too much facial oil with very little use. I used it for two nights, and it already looks nasty dirty. I basically throw the 25 dollars away because, I have no time to waste sending it back. I almost suspect this product gets fake reviews for it to have this many high reviews while it fails this badly with me. From my experience with eye masks, you are better off getting a very good material (wool, merino wool) headband. That way it also hugs your ears and doesn&#x27;t make you sweat or catch debris. I have used a smartwool headband for a while now, very comfortable and breathable. DO NOT fall for this piece of JUNK! I&#x27;d like to give it 0 starts but if possible.</li>
    <li> Helped me sleep longer/better! I also used the included earplugs and slept like a bear! Keeps cool during hot nights and leaves no lines on my (bald) head!!! Great item! Must have for these sun lit summer mornings!</li>
    <li> Too warm on face &amp; Velcro gets hair stuck in it regularly.</li>
    <li> Great mask it is adjustable, stays on your face, and muffles sound. The mask is fairly lightweight but puts enough pressure to keep your eyes shut and they are wide to keep light out. If you are someone who needs complete darkness this mask will do the trick. I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 08/13/2013:&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased this item a second time for my husband, and he has not complained about it. It can be adjusted at the back with velcro. The mask covers the upper face well and keeps light out, while the sides also muffles sounds. It is a good product I would highly recommend and purchase again.</li>
    <li> This mask blocks out some sound as well as all light, I love mine.</li>
    <li> I like having two masks. This one is quieter but rests directly on eye socket. Good for loud situations or where max light blockage is a must. Other w cups over eyes is more comfortable but doesn&#x27;t block noise or provide max blockage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never really had to wear a mask to sleep but the new shift at work changed that. This is a great mask. it is comfortable and does a good job of keeping out the light</li>
    <li> I like it but it isn&#x27;t perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agree with some of the other observations/complaints ... I&#x27;ve dealt with color bleeding on pillow cases and sheets for quite awhile, but found it real comfortable so kept using it anyway.  I don&#x27;t mind that it actually contacts my eyelids, but see where that would bother some users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially like the wide strap in the back, but also agree with the other reviewer that says if you don&#x27;t slide it down toward your neck, it could be annoying if you have a firm pillow.  That&#x27;s true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does buffer sound somewhat, but doesn&#x27;t do the job of eliminating my wife&#x27;s snoring.  :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint is that over time the fabric develops very fine frays in around the edge and they end up tickling my nose ... a real distraction, especially when trying to go to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the manufacturer could get rid of the fraying fabric, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars, despite the other minor issues.</li>
    <li> The mask is very comfortable, adjustable and certainly blocks out the light. The silky stuff tends to fray a bit when it rubs against the skin over time and that can tickle a bit but that&#x27;s the only drawback.</li>
    <li> Love this mask.  I use one every night and this one is comfortable and really helps me to sleep.  It is a part of my routine.</li>
    <li> wow this has made my life enjoyable again... sleeping has become my favorite past-time...who ever invented this is a genius thanks so much</li>
    <li> I have to say it really blocks the light, however the product was a little uncomfortable to wear. It made my head warm. The adjustment to either make it tighter or not in the back was a little bulky. It&#x27;s best used when lying on your side. The earplugs did little to cut out the noises. All in all, I was a little unsatisfied with this product. For it&#x27;s price especially. It may work for some, but it did little for me.</li>
    <li> Buy one you will love it! Stop wasting your money on cheap alternatives. This product is the best on the market. I take naps every day... The mask is comfortable, effective, and made to last. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> These are good for keeping out light, but have a few drawbacks.  They are very thick and warm.  This might be fine during the winter.  Unfortunately, during the summer they feel too hot and sweaty.  Also, beware where you place these after wearing them.  The built up moisture from having them on can cause the dyes to bleed onto their resting surface.</li>
    <li> The 2nd and 3rd Sleep Mask. The 1st one I still have for 3 years and is awesome!</li>
    <li> I love this mask!!!  I&#x27;ve been trying to find a sleep mask that really works for me.  I found another type that was light weight and did a good job, but, being a migraine sufferer, found that the strap on the back would slide and cause a pressure point at the base of my skull and trigger headaches.  So when I saw this one I thought it was worth a try.  I LOVE it.  It&#x27;s so soft on my head and really blocks the light, and it doesn&#x27;t cause any pressure points for me.  I&#x27;m ordering another so I have a backup!</li>
    <li> This is probably the best sleeping mask on the market. The material is the best part. It&#x27;s extremely soft and comfortable on your face.    It doesn&#x27;t get a perfect 5/5 score only because of the blatant false advertising that it blocks sound. It doesn&#x27;t block any sound at all! However, it does function to hold your ear plugs as it covers your ears.    In my opinion, it&#x27;s $5 overpriced. But you can&#x27;t put a value on a good sleep during the day. If you want a great comfortable functional sleeping mask, this is it.</li>
    <li> When I get this mask adjusted so it blocks most \\&quot;not all\\&quot; of the light, it&#x27;s puffy center is pressing on my eyes hard enough to make them hurt.  I give this 0 stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve now used 3 different masks hoping for optimal comfort and light blockage.  The Sleep Master was by far the most comfortable fit for me compared to the [[ASIN:B0027OUUFW Tempur-Pedic Sleep Mask]] and the [[ASIN:B000M3HEMC Mindfold Black out Sleeping Mask]] as long as I planned to keep my eyes closed.    My goal for a sleep mask is to assist in catching 1-2 more hours of good sleep in the summer months when early morning light starts streaming in about 5 AM through a window in my bedroom that is nearly impossible to adequately drape without undo financial expense.  Otherwise I am a relatively easy sleeper.  I don&#x27;t expect to wear the mask through the whole night -- just slip it on if I am sleeping lightly or not at all in those final hours.  I am most interested if work-related issues cut my available sleep options down to only 4-5 hours and these are further hampered by summer light.  Thus my experience may be different than those who routinely need a full 8-hour mask.    I think that one of the most difficult issues in sleep masks is that having differently shaped faces is going to influence whether we are personlaly satisfied or disappointed -- particularly if the expectation is a total blackout of external light.  Its hard to get something to fit well enough without being uncomfortable and intruding on sleep while still providing extreme \\&quot;black out\\&quot;.  Also, the longer we are exposed to low light, the more sensitive we will beocme to just a few stray photons.    That said. This mask excelled for comfort as long as my eyes were closed.  It was optimized for sleep and relies on closed eyes somewhat to minimize awareness of external light.  It might shift a little with sidelying or leaning against an airline window but not markedly enough for me to interfere with nasal breathing or create sinus pressure.  It might allow more light leakage after moving around some during sleep (particularly at the bottom and around the nose, but so far this has not been a major concern to me.      If I planned to use it for meditation, I would need to adjust my expectations some -- it doesn&#x27;t accomodate eyes open as well ss the Mindfold or Tempur-Pedic.  However, its lighter weight and silkier feel against the skin are an advantage if one meditates with eyes closed. Thus willingness to make some adaptations might make it a favorite.   For persons who wear a mask for other purposes, such as simulated experiences of visual impairment, for holotropic breathwork sessions, or a migraine phase with photosensitivity in which complete blackout might not be unnecessary, I think this model could work very nicely.      SUMMARY    What I liked best about the Sleep Master was a fairly moderate price, excellent comfort, and quite decent light blockage. Ordinarily I would also like the sound dampening feature of the retaining strap.  This would likely be a plus for many other users.  (But it becomes a bit of a hinderance for me on call nights, because I do want to hear my phone well...so on these nights I wear the Tempur-Pedic.) If 1/2 star rankings were permitted I would rank it as 4 and 1/2.  I didn&#x27;t rate it as a five-star product because I still wish that it was possible to have my eyes open without scrapping my eyelids, and a bit more light blockage.       Unfortunately, none of the masks I tried were completely satisfying for comfort and blackout, despite being on the moderate to higher end of the price range for this type of product.  I suspect it is inevitable that no single mask will optimally fit both men and women across all levels of fitness and facial contours.  Making more customer-specific masks may be possible, but these could then be harder to sell by mail when understandably there is a no-return-if-used policy due to hygeine policies.</li>
    <li> I had seen this Sleep Mask for sale for several years now, but was unwilling to pay the price.  Instead I bought cheaper masks;  in airports, on eBay, etc.  They were okay, but when I misplaced the last one, I went searching again and Sleep Master popped up.  Thinking there must be something to it since it is a best seller, I took the risk.  Well, to my complete surprise, the thing actually IS amazing.  I have never slept this kind of sleep; deep and undisturbed.  I am only sorry I didn&#x27;t make this investment in myself years ago.  Those other cheaper masks were actually the waste of money.  This mask is sturdy AND washable...I think it will last--that is until I leave it in some hotel or airplane...But, it&#x27;s worth the risk of needing to spend on a new one because it really IS the best!</li>
    <li> This is a very good sleep mask.  Although it is a bit wider than I expected, it is very comfortable and certainly does what it is supposed to do.  I have recommended it to other people who are \\&quot;light challenged\\&quot; in their bedrooms.  I would definitely buy another one.</li>
    <li> This is a great sleep mask. I tried several but liked the Sleep Master because of the satin-like material and because it covers your ears. It&#x27;s comfortable and easy to sleep with.</li>
    <li> I recently received the Sleep Master as a gift and absolutely LOVE it!  It feels incredibly comfortable, does not move when I roll from side to side during the night and breaths very well.  I&#x27;ve slept so much better since getting this product and given its affordable price will certainly be putting them in the stockings of my family and friends this Holiday season.</li>
    <li> This is by far the most comfortable mask I&#x27;ve tried. The construction is of good quality, the material used is soft and it blocks out all light. It was packaged well and delivered quickly. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my husband and my daughter for Christmas and WOW-what a great item for the cost! I tried them on and now I want a pair for myself! They are so soft and comfortable and form fitting. Very nice product.</li>
    <li> The mask does a good job in hiding light; however, there are two problems with it.  First, due to the soft silky material, it is very noisy around the ears.  Because of the design of the mask, the sides of it go over your ears.  When you roll over or move around, you hear the \\&quot;rustling\\&quot; sound in your ear.  It&#x27;s very distracting and tough to get to sleep.  The second problem is thst it gets very hot under this thing.  When you do take it of, you have usually a fair amount of sweat built up underneath. It&#x27;s because of the silky material up against ths skin. If you can deal with those two issues, this wask will work for you.  I prefer to find one that does not cover over the ears and is not so hot underneath.</li>
    <li> Quality is great. Works well. Worth the money versus buying a cheaper mask. I&#x27;m very happy. Since starting to use this mask my sleep is improved. No light, this mask doesn&#x27;t put pressure on my ears and it is easy to take off without undoing the velcro. It also holds its shape. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> This mask has a nice smooth silky feel, it is slightly on the heavy side which can sometimes make it uncomfortable if you blink or squint while falling asleep. The fabric seems to get rougher and start pilling as use goes on which I do not like much. The thing I like about this mask is it is very big and covers the eyes a decent amount so not a lot of light can get through from your cheek level or upper forehead like a standard cheap mask would. I also like that it is big enough that it hasn&#x27;t accidentally fallen behind my bed. The design needs some small improvements and then I would give it at least 4 stars. The major major thing I dislike about this mask is that the Velcro on the back is very thick and it makes a lump right on the back of the mask that is uncomfortable against my skull when I am trying to sleep on my back on a firm bed, the lump is bad enough - that sometimes I get annoyed with &#x27;wearing&#x27; the mask - and instead unfasten the mask and just drape it over my eyes (which means if I turn over in my sleep the mask detaches completely. The other point (though not as annoying) which really bugs me is if you toss and turn in your sleep the mask tends to slip off very easily, the fabric has part to do with this, and the other factor at play here is most likely the fact that the mask has no hard form to it so the nose divider tends to easily slide off the bridge of your nose and you end up with the eye portion of the mask suddenly on the side of your head! The company should really make the following changes: slim down the back of the mask so it has less fabric and less thick Velcro / is softer; find a slightly lighter fabric which is more durable and does not start to pill after slight friction (i.e. if I accidentally rub the mask against the exposed brick wall near my bed), add some form of rigid structure to the nose bridge, perhaps add some form so there is less friction with your eye lids, consider adding some concave form to the area of fabric that overlaps with your check bone - this would help keep out a lot more light, if I try going to sleep when someone else in the room needs all the lights on - I still notice light leaking in from the cheek area - just enough to bug me and keep me from falling asleep fast. All in all I am disappointed with the mask, as I looked at the ample glowing reviews here before buying and had higher expectations.</li>
    <li> A+ product and seller. AMAZING SLEEP MASK! Helps me fall into a deep restful sleep, and works better than all other sleep mask I&#x27;ve ever tried.(the other mask would cover my eyes, but would slip and slide all during the night, and let flashes of light in, which made me wake up all during the night, getting roughly 3 1/2 hours sleep. But you WILL NOT have these problems with the Sleepmaster-I&#x27;ve enjoyed the most sound, relaxing sleep ever since I purchased mine. Now I get roughly 9+ hours of sleep with my Sleepmaster mask, and the quality of my sleep has improved 100%) Seller wrote friendly msg on my invoice (sweet dreams) which I found very thoughtful and friendly- thanks! I highly recommend BOTH product and seller. Thanks again, best wishes, and yes, I&#x27;m now having very sweet dreams because of this product! PLEASE buy one today to experience what \\&quot;real\\&quot; sleep feels like!  You will LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this mask!! This is the 2nd one I&#x27;ve bought, I wore the first out. I bought the last one at least 2 years ago. It&#x27;s such a comfortable mask and I can&#x27;t sleep without it. I also love that it is made in the USA. Comes with red, white and blue ear plugs too.</li>
    <li> I found this product to work less effectively than a $3 sleep mask I bought at target.  Here&#x27;s why:    This sleep mask has no elastic band to hold it in place. Rather it has two Velcro strips on the material which you wrap around your head and attach at the back. What this means is that once you put it on it cannot dynamically adjust to your head should it move slightly in the night. The result of this is the mask slips up or down your head it does not stay tight. Like most people I have a somewhat spherical head, it is biggest around at my ears and tappers off towards a dome at the top of my head. I put the mask on and go to sleep. If my movements in the night cause the mask to move up a little it it is now around a part of my head which is smaller and it quickly becomes loose and basically falls off.    A simple redesign could alleviate this: On one of the two Velcro straps put a short elastic strap so that there is a little give.    The second issue is that it is loud! There is material covering your ears. The intention of this material is to muffle noise, but the material moves against my ears as I roll around and I hear a loud noise from the fibers in the cloth rubbing against my ears.  A simple change in the material could make this quieter.    To resolve those two issues with the mask one has to wear the mask so tightly it can&#x27;t possibly move. To wear it so tightly causes headaches and discomfort. Additionally if the mask is so tight it puts too much pressure on my upper nose that I can&#x27;t breath properly.    In my opinion one is better off to consider a different product.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing I have EVER bought for myself, LOVE it! Great seller too.  I use this every single night.  My husband uses his computer late and I don&#x27;t see any light or hear any noise (He has sound off, but the keys or the mouse click is sounded out).  I also like to sleep in on the weekends and it keeps my world dark until I am ready to wake up!  I have used a sleep mask for a couple of years and decided to invest in a good quality one.  This does not have any elastic to stretch and mis shape, the material is soft on your skin and is very light to wear.  I recommend this one million percent!</li>
    <li> This was a fantastic purchase, very high quality product and very fast shipping. This sleep mask is very comfortable, highly adjustable, and has a fantastic design. It feels good on my face, and fits better than any other sleep mask I&#x27;ve ever used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0015NZ6FK Revolutionary, Patented SLEEP MASTER Sleep Mask]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> Wow! It&#x27;s either you love it or you hate it.. Well, I&#x27;m sorry but I hate it. I really wanted to love this based on all the great reviews. The reasons I don&#x27;t like it are; It gets way to hot for me, if your a hot sleeper your not going to like this. I sleep with the window open in the dead of winter, so this really doesn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s not light proof!! This is the #1 reason I use these. It doesn&#x27;t conform to my ears, you may think this is trivial, but have you ever woken up and been sleeping on your ear folded?? That&#x27;s how I wake up, with both ears feeling like they&#x27;ve been folded and slept on all night. It slips off, if you turn at all while sleeping this won&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to light, and this give great coverage. But because it is so wide, it also shuts out some noise too. Actually, it sort of gives the feeling that I&#x27;m under the covers, which is very relaxing.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband.  Typically, he waited to put on a mask in the morning when I get up in the morning to block the closet light and anything that gets through the curtains.&lt;br /&gt;He has been wearing the new mask all night and has found it to be very comfortable.</li>
    <li> I have tried *many* sleep masks, and this is my favorite, with reservations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;* The mask is wide, and it is very effective at blocking out light.&lt;br /&gt;* It also covers your ears, muffling sounds.&lt;br /&gt;* The mask is silky - not grippy - against your face. (I&#x27;ve owned masks in the past that had a soft but grippy material in the inside, which bothered my eyebrows.)&lt;br /&gt;* The mask is large and hard to misplace among my pillows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;* The silky material extends all the way around the mask, which means that it slips out of place several times a night.&lt;br /&gt;* There is no elastic, and adjusting the mask to fit my head in a position that both blocked out the light and didn&#x27;t immediately slip out of place was challenging, and I&#x27;m not sure I ever got it just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish that the mask contained a wide elastic with velcro adjustment in the back. I think that would take this from being a great sleep mask, to nearly perfect.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this - really blocks out the light. No problems with pressure</li>
    <li> Barely fit around my big head. Very uncomfortable because of that and light came in from several different places around my nose and by my forehead.</li>
    <li> Pros: Blocks out the light. Does not have any elastic in the strap and thus does not need multiple adjustments.  Cons: Has a satin cover which frays with use and tickles the nose. Does not block out air thus allowing eyes to dry out overnight even with use of eye gel.  Summary: A good memory foam sleep mask with non-elastic velcro strap works much better.</li>
    <li> A great way to block out almost 99% of all light getting to your eyes and totally dampen any noise getting to your ears, this mask will definately do it. the material is very comfortable and the velcro fastening seems to work very well. It does seem to breathe well but I have not tried it yet in the hot summer Vegas nights.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for four or five years. It&#x27;s still in terrific shape, and still comfortable. The design is dirt-simple, but it works.</li>
    <li> The item works as intended, the only complaint that I have is that the velcro on the 2 straps should be reversed so that the velcro does not stick to pillows and such while sleeping.  I turned the mask inside out and it doesn&#x27;t have the sticky side facing out, but it doesn&#x27;t fit as well that way. Otherwise good item.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t sleep without complete darkness. As soon as the sun comes up, I&#x27;m up.  This mask is light, but it blocks all the light.  I have tried many mask, but this one is my favorite!  It is pretty too:)</li>
    <li> I am a very light sleeper and the glow from the clock and other electronics drive me crazy. I have tried many sleep masks and most of them have elastic bands, which tend to get uncomfortable during the night.  This mask is large, soft and does not cut off my circulation like the masks with elastic bands. It also keeps out the light if you adjust it properly.  I have a more restful sleep wearing this mask. I love it.</li>
    <li> My wife loves these masks.</li>
    <li> I finally found a mask that I can sleep with. This is it. What a great product. I plan on getting a few and wearing them for years.</li>
    <li> From the description, you might expect that this mask incorporates sound dampening materials for the sound reduction claimed, but it does very little if any reduction in sound unless you use the earplugs included. Plugs can be uncomforable after a while.  As for the claim that this mask can be worn with a CPAP, it can but then it leaks light as there is nothing like a soft wire between the materials for crimping the sleep mask around the CPAP mask near the nose. This is a problem even with the smaller \\&quot;nose pilow\\&quot; type of CPAP. A full mask CPAP can not be worn on top of the sleep mask because this breaks CPAP vacuum. Mask also slips around easily unless it is very tight. As other reviews mention, this places some pressure on the eyes which is a problem for those of us using CPAP which can be drying to the eyes, making them sensitive.  This product is only very marginally useful for CPAP wearers; it can shield the eyes from some of the CPAP  exit air, but mask does little then to prevent light from disturbing sleep.</li>
    <li> I love this sleep mask, it has the right amount of padding, the width is nice so there&#x27;s no temple gouging of any kind, no pressure on the tops of the cheeks or on the ears, the velcro keeps it in place so I can switch sides as many times as I want and it stays in place, the long slits at the eyes fit nicely on the sides of my nose and overall it has a luxurious feel. The delivery was quick and I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I have severe insomnia (I&#x27;m prescribed ambien)and I think that the masks help a little. I know there are tons of rave reviews but I personally don&#x27;t like this mask at all. This is not sound proof what so ever, being a wild sleeper, I toss and turn a lot in my sleep, I have yet to wake up once with this still on my head. It slips off way to easily, even when it&#x27;s pretty snug. I&#x27;ve had better masks, including a $5.00 one here on amazon.</li>
    <li> The product does as it indicates, it muffles sounds and blocks light.  It is comfortable to wear.  The only issue I have is that with my hair cut short, it makes noice while I am settling into the pillow which is somewhat irritating but it eventually does lessen to allow me to fall asleep.  I work nights which is the reason I purchased the product.</li>
    <li> When I put this mask on, I felt extremely claustrophobic, because the mask wraps around the entire head, ears and all. I was unable to use this mask, and had to return it for a refund the next day. It DID block out the light, but I just couldn&#x27;t overcome the sensation of putting my head inside a bag. Also, the  mask was a little heavier than I thought it would be.  I almost felt as if I was putting a weight on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this company&#x27;s defense though, when I called to return the mask, they couldn&#x27;t have been nicer.  They made it very easy for me to return it.  They sounded genuinely sorry that their product didn&#x27;t work for me, and they processed my return, and returned my money within 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely give the mask a failing grade (for me), but I would give their customer service an A.  I would not hesitate to give this company my business in the future if they come out with another mask, with a different design.</li>
    <li> Great mask, it is very soft, light and really comfortable.  It appears that its construction would allow it to adapt to any user. I find it blocks out the light well and doesn&#x27;t cut into the back of the head like the ones with elastic straps do.  It allows me to sleep right through the break of day which always wakes me up otherwise.</li>
    <li> I am a picky sleeper, there&#x27;s no pretending otherwise.  One of my conditions to fall asleep is needing a sleep mask for pitch black.  As such, many sleep masks are incapable of blocking out enough light.  I have to fall asleep with sound, so I fall asleep with my TV on.  Therefore, my sleep masks have to be able to block out light effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a sleep mask I loved, and that worked well, but it leeched dye onto my pillow and sheets no matter how many times I washed it.  So, I tried again, and though this sleep mask is far from attractive it&#x27;s comfortable, effective, and I slept like a dream in it!</li>
    <li> I live in Barrow Alaska (24 hour Sun)  even with room darkening shades I couldn&#x27;t sleep until I got this mask.  It covers the ears for partial noise reduction also but can get kinda warm.</li>
    <li> I have purchased many sleep masks over the decades and the SleepMaster is by far the BEST!! I have a strong preference for this particular product for several reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It is super padded and well constructed (no flimsy material!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The foam section wraps around my entire head and covers my ears (very useful in muffling ambient noise)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) It&#x27;s COMFORTABLE and it WORKS!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is priced a bit on the high side, but you get what you pay for, plus the SleepMaster lasts FOREVER. The quality materials and nice workmanship ensures the product holds up over multiple washings. The quality is so good, the SleepMaster should be sold at Neiman Marcus or Saks....definitely top of the line!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this sleep mask because my bedroom window faces east, so every morning, I was \\&quot;blinded by the light\\&quot;. NO MORE! You can move the mask around on your face so that it blocks out all visible light, and the velcro closure makes it totally adjustable to the size of your head. It is comfortable no matter what position you sleep in. I have only had it a week or two and I almost can&#x27;t sleep without it. The only slightly negative thing about it is sometimes it makes my head a little sweaty. Well worth the money! I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Allison, Denver, CO</li>
    <li> What I Like:&lt;br /&gt;I like the velcro adjustment in the back. There is a large range of size options and a lot of velcro material to keep it fastened. I also like how the mask goes over your ears instead of an elastic band that sits right where eyeglasses would and slowly saws into your skin. Going over the ears provides a slight noise muffling effect as well. Not as good as ear plugs but it helps keep ear plugs in place. I personally like a little pressure on my eyes and dislike the cupped shape of many other masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t Like:&lt;br /&gt;This slides up and off my head while I sleep. It also is too loose along that critical area around your nose and upper cheeks and lets light in. Sliding up on my head only makes the problem worse. I think some of these have to do with the shape of my head and face but I think most of the problems could be solved changing the layout of the velcro closure in the back. It just needs to be moved down a little. I tried pulling the whole thing down further, but it puts pressure on my nose and reduces airflow. Also, this mask is fairly expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A trade-off:&lt;br /&gt;I think velcro is a more secure and reliable fastening method compared to an elastic band and it has a lot of room for adjustability. All of this unfortunately makes it pretty loud when you try to adjust it which might disturb your partner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give this 2.5 stars if the system would allow.</li>
    <li> Best sleep mask out there. Bottom line.</li>
    <li> Love it! Nice and big to block the light and super soft fabric :)</li>
    <li> I bought this mask and another more traditional mask at the same time.  The other one would never stay on through the night with my tossing and turning.  This Sleep Master stayed on very well, and I consider the sound dampening a plus.  LIght inevitably creeps in at the bottom by my nose, so that part is not perfect.  All in all, my guess is that this is one of the best masks for keeping out light while staying on your head with a lot of tossing and turning.    But one of the main features of my mask has been it tendency to transfer a lot of black pigment onto the pillow and sheets, enough to ruin them with stains.  I&#x27;m sure I sweat a bit under the mask, but not effusively.  I&#x27;ve washed the mask twice in the washer, and it still transfers pigment.  I have had to use a \\&quot;guest pillow\\&quot; without any pillow case so that I don&#x27;t mind getting pigment all over the pillow.  I haven&#x27;t seen anyone else complain about this, so I&#x27;m stumped.  I&#x27;m going to wash it a couple more times to see if that helps.  If you buy this product, I recommend testing it out on a pillow case that you don&#x27;t mind ruining.</li>
    <li> I ordered this sleep mask to take with me on a mission trip to Peru. I arrived the day I left, so I wasn&#x27;t able to take it with me. I tried it out after I got back. It works ok as a sleep mask, although it shifts around while you sleep. Also, the claim the product makes about muffling sounds? Not true. I still heard children playing in the other room, dogs barking, rain pouring, garage door opening, etc. Overall, not really impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great sleeping mask.  I have tried more than one, and it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far. Its primary virtue is that it makes a comfortable seal around the eyes to prevent any stray light from getting in. Many other masks don&#x27;t completely seal out all the light.  The fabric is quite thick and plush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT!!!  The only problem with this mask could be wearing it in hot or humid climates, in which case it&#x27;s thickness would be a liability, causing your face to feel hot and sweaty.  In dryer or colder climates, we have experienced no problem whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I still struggle with blocking out light. This mask slips off my head at night. Light comes in through the nose opening too. It doesn&#x27;t do a thing about keeping my hair in place. I find it hard to get it placed right. I bought one of these a few years ago and liked it better. It was black and very simple. It did all the things this one is supposed to do, only much better. It disappeared.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time sleeping or even resting when there is light or noise.I like to use it when I&#x27;m on long flights but I also use it to block out Fianc&amp;eacute;e snorting when he sleeps. The material is nice,and it covers you ears to block our noise.</li>
    <li> I saw this product featured in Men&#x27;s Journal a year or so ago and had to try it out for a long trip I had to Europe. I have never been able to sleep very well on planes, but as soon as I tried the Sleep Master on my trip, I fell asleep almost immediately, and slept soundly until we landed! I continued to use the mask on the rest of the two week trip and it worked great. I felt rested and totally relaxed. It even helped me recover from my jet lag. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good night&#x27;s sleep whether on the road or even at home. Very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Works great, and yes I have tried most of the others.  From the cheap ones they give on airplanes to some of the top rated ones sold here.    * Blocks ALL the light, no seepage on the sides.  * It does indeed reduce the outside noise.  Loud places you may still need earplugs, but I can tell the difference with this on.  * Very comfortable.  * Unlike the more rigid sleep masks, this can be rolled up as easy as a sock for travel.    Other reviewers have said this mask puts pressure on their eyes - um they either have huge alien bug eyes or they work for the competition that makes a big bra-looking cupped eye mask.  I own that kind too, and I prefer this mask but then again I have normal sized human eyes.    Only downside for me is that the mask covers enough of my head that it can get hot.  Not often but in the summer I will sometimes wake to the covered area being hotter/sweaty.  The material could I suppose be made to breathe a bit more as its a very soft silk like material.    Overall very happy to own this and have not used any of the others after I bought this one.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is not a sleepmask as you have come to know them.  This is basically a silk pillow that wraps around your head.  There are no strings or cords.  The thing attaches to itself with velcro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certainly, no light is going to be getting to your eyes if you don this thing.  It can also double for earplugs in a pinch since you can lower the wraps to go over your ear.  It&#x27;s washable, and feels like satin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem for me is that this thing makes my head hot.  For the first few hours, everything&#x27;s okay.  But then the sheer thickness of the thing makes me break into a sweat, which soon wakes me up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is worth its weight in gold when you&#x27;re on a long flight, though.  I don&#x27;t know about ordinary sleeping.</li>
    <li> The big problem with this mask is that the part that wraps to the back, with the velcro, is very thick. It&#x27;s as thick or thicker in the back, at the back of your head, as it is on the front. If you sleep on your back, this means you can feel a thick lump of fabric right on the back of your head. I sleep on my back, I was really surprised at how uncomfortable this mask was. I tried it for 2 nights to see if I could get used to it, but it didn&#x27;t work out. I&#x27;m not sure why they wouldn&#x27;t design it to be lower profile in the back -- very strange decision. I&#x27;m not sure how anyone could rate this mask very highly because of this flaw.</li>
    <li> I work nights, and must sleep from 5AM to 1PM every day in a sunny bedroom. I&#x27;ve tried every sleep mask on the market. I recommend this sleep mask above and beyond ALL the others!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that makes it better, (and different) is that it covers your ears as well as your eyes. (Yes, You CAN hear the alarm go off!) If you wear earplugs with it, it&#x27;s almost completely sound proof.  It&#x27;s also the most comfortable mask I&#x27;ve tried. And, you can wash it in the washing machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 2, so I can always keep one clean.</li>
    <li> this is the best sleep mask I have tried.  I also tried the one that has thera fome or something like that but can not compare to this mask.  I sleep on my stomach, side, back and toss and turn all night long and this mask stays in place and never bothers me.  Just got one for my husband.And it keeps all the light out.  I sleep very sound now with this.    Rita</li>
    <li> Perfect product for travel.  You can sleep when you need to - really blocks the light and very comfortable.</li>
    <li> Being on a swing shift has caused numerous problems, the biggest of which is difficulty sleeping. I bought the sleepmaster as an aid in that respect and it works very well. With the master on, the room seems totally dark and its easier to achieve a deep sleep; being padded, it&#x27;s comfortable to wear. The only downside I have may not be true for everyone: after wearing it for so many hours it feels uncomfortable. I wear it over my ears and eventually it starts to bother me , and I take it off. Overall, it&#x27;s helped a great deal and I would recommend it. Perhaps others wouldn&#x27;t be as bothered as I am at times.</li>
    <li> The Sleep Master sleep mask is the best on the market, bar none. I&#x27;ve bought three Sleep Masters and have friends that use them as well. We all LOVE the mask...It is so light, it&#x27;s almost like having no mask on at all, except that all the light and most noise is blocked out, so I fall asleep and stay asleep all night long.  I used to call myself Sleepless in Sacramento but thanks to Sleep Master, I&#x27;m now Sleeping in Sacramento!  Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> My wife needs to read to fall asleep &amp; the light keeps me from really sleeping. This sleep mask does the trick. No more conflict! Its comfortable and totally dark in there. Very happy with product &amp; fast delivery.</li>
    <li> It may seem silly to you to use two eye masks at once, but having had sleep problems for many years I can tell you it is worth it!  Currently the best results I have ever gotten are using the Sleep Master with another I also purchased from Amazon underneath (Dream Essentials Sweet Dreams Contoured Sleep Mask).  The contoured one fits my face great &amp; leaves room for my eyeballs to move, but it doesn&#x27;t stay in place well enough during the night by itself.  Enter the Sleep Master.  Huge size fits over the contoured mask &amp; holds it in place.  No light all night.  Sweet dreams!</li>
    <li> Item was lost in the mail &amp; finally arrived 4 weeks after ordering it when I raised the matter to customer service. The product does block out all light yet it&#x27;s bulky but not too heavy. Some what big and can get uncomfortable if you aren&#x27;t falling asleep w/in 15-20min.  I do like it blocks out the light.</li>
    <li> Within two hours you will be trying to find this pos, which will have slid RIGHT off of your face and under your bed. i don&#x27;t move much in my sleep and this mask has never lasted more than an hour without me waking up my husband, looking for my lost mask. Buy another one, trust me.</li>
    <li> My 20 year old son is finally sleeping after years of struggling to get asleep and stay asleep.  He says it is comfortable and stays in place.  So many teens are night owls and struggle with getting enough sleep to get up and go to school or college. This would effect his grades and (ugh!) his disposition.  Thanks to Sleep Master we are all sleeping soundly now.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of the reviews and thought maybe at last.  So I wraped it on and lay my wittle head down to sleep.  Zzzzz  Got up in the middle of the night (never mind why!) and it was still in place ... hmmm ... so far so good. Zzzzz 6:00 am light creaps around the edge of the curtains ...Zzzzz.  7:00 am ... Sugar plums ... Zzzz  8:00 am ... Zzzzz  9:00 am ...Blink!  Pulls pillow over face ... pitch black again.  Too late brain begins to tremble, what the heck?  Removes pillow ... yah that&#x27;s light alright, must be leaking at the nose.      Crap, knew I should have just painted my swim goggle black and saved the bucks!     Frustration subsides ... pressing around nose, higher, then lower with eyes open under the patented silky smooth material.  Realization setting in ... this is a great material, it blocks about 80 to 90 percent of the light.  Unfortunately the other 20 percent woke me up! Argh! Stupid designer! Patented my arse! Rant ... old mask, new mask ... junk, junk I tell ya!    Brain trembles again ... put old mask on underneath and achieve pitch black ... Zzzz.  Cleavah man ... except, you do realize I can never, never tell my wife how much I paid for this. Of course if discovered, I&#x27;ll tell her the new one was an optional attachement I bought for the old mask.  All will be well.</li>
    <li> I love this mask.  Took it to Egypt and wore it on a long bus trip.  The strap is long enough to fit around my noise canceling headphones and it is soft enough to fit snugly without being uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> I use this mask every night.  It&#x27;s the most comfortable one I&#x27;ve tried and helps me fall asleep fast and stay asleep.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Sleeping in the barracks in Afghanistan with 10 other noisy females.. this blocks out light very well soft durable and well made. I&#x27;m going by another worth every penny</li>
    <li> As promised after trying this new mask for a few weeks I am writing a new review.     First of all I would like to address the worst review of this mask which apparently people are marking helpful. The lady she got mold in her mask after 4 days of wear which made her allergies flare up. Absolute rubbish. She goes on about her favorite mask being closed cell foam or something like that and provides a link to it. I suspect she knows the seller of the other mask. I actually ordered the other mask she speaks of when I ordered the black version of this mask several years ago. It was no where near as good or comfortable as this mask. Secondly I also have allergies to mold and have never had a problem with this mask and the materials of the mask are clearly written on the card that came with the mask if she had bothered to look. There is no foam in it. The inside is cotton.     The mask I had from a few years ago was the Black model which they no longer sell. The only real problem with that mask was that if you sweat the black could bleed a little on to the pillow case. I finally got around to reviewing the mask a few months ago and stated that was the only problem. At that time the owner of the company emailed me after reading my review and appologized to me for the problem. She said this was a probelm with their supplier and had switched to the blue material for this very reason and was sending me a new blue mask to replace it free of charge! Now that is good customer service since I had not even contacted the company with a problem.    After trying out the blue mask for several weeks I can tell you that there is no longer a bleeding problem and I have no hesitation in giving this mask 5 stars. It is more confortable and blocks more light than any other mask I have tried. It is true that a very small amount of light may get in around the the bottom of the nose but I have never tried any mask that did not do that. It is very minimal with this mask however, better than theothers I have tried.     Don&#x27;t expect the sound muffling feature to be of much use. It will block about as much sound as pulling the blankets over your head. If you want to block sound use ear plugs. The free ones included with the mask are my personal favorite and I order them 200 at a time. (different manufacturer) Together this duo is unbeatable if you have to sleep during the daytime. I also black out my windows since I am a shift worker and have to often sleep during the day.     The mask is also hand washable and I recommend you do wash it fairly regularly to avoid getting dust mites in it, just like you would with your sheets and pillow cases. I actually wash mine in the gentle cycle and have not had a problem. Just make sure you close the velcro strap first or that can fray the outside if left open.    In conclusion I would say you really cannot go wrong with this mask. Great mask. Great customer service. What more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> I figured it would be cheaper to buys this $20 mask than spend several thousand dollars on blackout curtains, and they do work.  On the positive side, they are comfortable and in fact feel really nice to sleep in.  And if you bought it for kinky stuff, I think it would work equally well.     I have, however, noticed two drawbacks. First because of the way it straps around the head it slides around a lot of you move around a lot. Second is that I tend to have crazy dreams when i use these. I have no idea why this happens, but it&#x27;s kind of fun unless of course it&#x27;s a nightmare.</li>
    <li> All the other masks that I&#x27;ve tried have had elastic straps that would always dig into my ear during the night.  The fact that this mask covers your ears makes it extremely comfortable to wear.  My wife and I wear them every night.  The light blocking is very good.  The ear coverage does not help reduce noise.  Use earplugs or a fan if it&#x27;s too noisy.    The original masks we received were black and the dye bled out onto our pillow cases after a month.  Some sort of reaction with the oil on our faces caused the dye to bleed.  We informed Sleep Master, and they promptly replaced the mask with a teal version, which appears to be what they&#x27;re selling now.  Great customer service.</li>
    <li> This Sleep Master Sleep Mask is the best sleep mask I have ever worn. Given that it is very wide, it covers the eyes very well, so you can´t see any light at all. Also, it is made up of a satin fabric that makes it very comfortable to wear in your face. It is very soft, so it doesn´t leave sleep marks on your face. I recommend it very much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this sleep patch for a little over two weeks now and I have to say from &#x27;my personal&#x27; experience this is the best sleep mask I ever owned.  Why? Because it stays on my face.  This mask has the adjustable velcro straps.  A lot better than the elastic straps any day.  I don&#x27;t have to use a scarf to really secure this because it stays over my eyes and head the whole night.  I&#x27;ve also slept through the whole night on some days.  I don&#x27;t know why I need to say that but I feel it&#x27;s relevant because with my old mask I would have to use the restroom about 1-3 times a night and would have difficulty falling back to sleep.  I&#x27;ve only gotten up once in the night about one or two days max.  I even fell back to sleep with no problems.  No tossing or turning that much either.  The only problem I had with this mask is that when I first got it I had it too tight around my eyes on two occasions.  This caused my eyes to be severely blurry and it took about ten minutes for my vision to come back.  I also have severe dry skin and I always have flakes across my eyebrows when I take the mask off.  Other than that this mask is the best mask I&#x27;ve ever owned so far.</li>
    <li> Hi,    I tried 5 sleeping mask before this, but this is the best sleeping mask I ever used, Its very comfortable and gives me a good sleep. I will buy another set of this for travelling</li>
    <li> I actually had this product idea, while travelling overseas, and using one of those sleep masks you buy the the airport travel store that did not work very well.  Wondered if one could be made that went around you head and also offered some noise protection for your ears, and someone finally did it.  While my wife watches TV and has lights on, I use two earplugs, and this sleep mask, and it is like being in a dark room.  I love it, works very well.</li>
    <li> Very soft and flexible. Does help cover the ears. Can see a little light at the bottom near the nose. Does help me sleep with the street light out my window shining through the window shades.</li>
    <li> the best but I lost mine</li>
    <li> I LOVE this face mask so much. It is very soft and comfortable, fits  well, completely blocks the light, and also muffles the sound. I work nights, and this mask has been a godsend. I bought one for two other family members, and they love it too. Great product and great seller! Three thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all, and this is the best sleep mask on the planet, IMO.  I first wore it two months ago, and it hasn&#x27;t left my side since.  It works so well I love telling everyone about it...It&#x27;s incredibly soft and comfortable.  I like the way the fit adjusts depending on the circumstances, whether it&#x27;s a full night&#x27;s sleep (snug), or a brief nap in my desk chair (looser).  I work in a professional setting, in my own office.  Occasionally, instead of going to lunch, I take a nap in my chair.  How wonderfully refreshing.  The sound muffling reduces distracting outside noise from my co-workers.  This sleep mask gets my highest praise and rating.</li>
    <li> My husband has had his for over a year.  He uses it nearly every night. Still does NOT need to be replaced.</li>
    <li> This is the most comfortable sleep mask I have ever owned.  It blocks out light and muffles the noise because the strap used to secure the mask around your head covers your ears too; with ear plugs, you can eliminate all sound.  I have only owned this mask for a short time but it appears well made.  The fabric is soft and the stuffing allows for a comfortable feel around your eyes, face, and ears.  The Velcro attachment in the back insures a secure fit and eliminates any mask movement that may occur while sleeping.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I did not care for this sleep mask.  I wanted one that was a little more substantial or thicker and I did not like the slippery material as it seemed like it would not stay in place.  I much preferred the \\&quot;Heat-Sensitive Memory Foam Sleep Mask\\&quot; that I ordered at the same time from Amazon and really really liked.</li>
    <li> This mask is many things claimed by the manufacturer: lightweight, easy velcro closure, washable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a fairly small head, so the sizing was important to me. I think almost everyone could wear this mask out of the box, but, if not, adding a bit of velcro would do the trick. This also helps the mask to really stay on, too. Some masks with simple elastic cords always ended up under my pillow by morning because I pulled them off during the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it extends over the ears, because this helps earplugs stay in. I&#x27;m looking forward to taking it on an airplane trip for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I really, really don&#x27;t like is the nose bridge. If I place it to keep out light, it is extremely uncomfortable. That lack of comfort is the sole reason for giving it three stars. If you don&#x27;t believe this will be a problem for you, it&#x27;s otherwise exceptionally good and priced reasonably.</li>
    <li> I bought this item based on reviews but was disappointed especially regarding quality. It just does not feel new and certainly not worth this price. It also does not fit securely in place.</li>
    <li> I, like many other people who are buying these, work nights and sleep during the day. This sleep mask blocks out most of the light, but some does get through near your nose.  I ended up pairing this up with a \\&quot;Dream Essentials Sweet Dreams Contoured Sleep Mask\\&quot; and combined absolutely no light gets through.      I use the dream essentials sleep mask underneath the sleep master and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Did not contact the seller. But am very pleased with the product as it has performed as advertised, blocking out light completely while being very comfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> Its horrible, cant sleep at all, its like wrapping paper or cotton around your head, it feels heavy on the eyes.. just awful. not worth it.</li>
    <li> I am currently deployed at the moment, so any kind of sleep is very well appreciated. I decided to buy this mask because it looked comfortable. The moment I started using it, I was able to sleep very well! I love how it blocks all light and also covers your ears so it can muffle the sound. Its not tight because its adjustable with the velcro fastener on the back, so its definitely for different types of face structures. I really recommend this sleep mask, because its comfortable, it doesn&#x27;t feel like its on, and it works!</li>
    <li> I bought this sleep mask because I&#x27;m a full-time graduate student and I&#x27;ve been getting very little sleep lately. I&#x27;ve had it for about a week and I&#x27;m really happy with it. It feels comfortable, blocks plenty of light, and I actually get more restful sleep.</li>
    <li> I love this mask! It keeps 99% of the light out, it is silky soft, and it has an adjustable velcro closure for that \\&quot; perfect fit.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This mask has allowed me many more hours of sleep because it so effectively blocks out light in the morning.</li>
    <li> I spend as many nights in hotels as I do in my own bed. Often, multiple LED&#x27;s in the room along with the frequent bright lights outside the hotel window create a room that&#x27;s too light to sleep. I tried every eye mask available and the Sleep Master Sleep Mask is the best.     When I used the smaller or more contoured eye masks, light would get in and/or I&#x27;d wake up with red-eye because somehow the edge of the eye mask would end up between my eye-lids and would irritate my eyes during the night. Also, with the other types, the narrow elastic bands would irritate my ears or cause soreness around my ears by morning.     The Sleep Master Sleep Mask is comfortable, with soft edges  and no elastic so that there is no chance of eye or ear irritation. It&#x27;s washable (instructions say hand wash but I&#x27;ve had no problem washing it in the washing machine on gentle in a mesh bag and then air drying it). The Velcro when closed low on the back of the head near the neck causes no \\&quot;lump\\&quot; to sleep on for back sleepers.     Also, the company&#x27;s customer service is above and beyond most vendors&#x27; efforts. They truly care about making sure customers are happy and bend over backward to rectify any problems.</li>
    <li> Silk, comfortable, wraps the face for good black out, can hold earplugs in well.  Good product.</li>
    <li> I ordered the sleep mask for me, but when my husband tried it on, he liked it so much that he didn&#x27;t give it back! He uses it every night and absolutely LOVES it. Guess I&#x27;ll have to order another one for myself. Great product.</li>
    <li> This mask is very soft and comfortable.....when it will stay on your head.  Unfortunately, being made of satin on all surfaces, it slips off hair and face easily. Was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0015NZ6FK Revolutionary, Patented SLEEP MASTER tm Sleep Mask]]  I love my Sleep Master Mask.  I was having trouble with early awakening due to the summer sunrise time.  The Sleep Master Mask is now enabling me to sleep to my normal wake up  time.  I have so much more energy!</li>
    <li> This is the best sleep mask on the market. Full stop.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, when I first saw it on amazon I thought I&#x27;d save a buck and buy one of the cheaper masks - big mistake. Three crappy, useless masks later I decided to take the plunge and buy the Sleep Master and I have not looked back.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s comfortable, blocks out all light, is easy to clean, lightweight ... I mean, they don&#x27;t call it the Sleep Master for nothing. Learn from my mistakes - don&#x27;t waste your time with ineffective imitations. Do it right the first time - buy the Sleep Master.</li>
    <li> this sleep mask is ok. nothing great. i dont care for how it goes around your head i like having it kinda tight but u cant do that with this one. u adjust it to your head and thats where it stays. comes off easy and not that great for blocking out light from around your nose</li>
    <li> I have tried a few others in the past, but was always bothered by the elastic at the back of my head. This Sleep Mask has velcro so it stays in place, is VERY comfortable, and blocks all the light. The others are a waste of time and money. I could&#x27;nt be more happy.</li>
    <li> I love this product and will continue to buy from this seller.  I bought one first for myself and just recently bought one for my husband.  We both agree that this is what we&#x27;re looking for in a sleep mask.</li>
    <li> I really love.  I bought it to travel to Europe a month ago, and I continue using it everynight and day.  I cant sleep with light sun, and now I can sleep more hours and very confortable.</li>
    <li> Puffy over the ears, slightly uncomfortable but you get used to it</li>
    <li> Pro:&lt;br /&gt;* Soft material&lt;br /&gt;* Nice fabric&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;* Light seeps in around nose&lt;br /&gt;* Too much pressure on eyes if tightened to prevent light seep&lt;br /&gt;* Very warm, not comfortable for whole night</li>
    <li> This is the second sleep master eye mask i have purchased via Amason, the first one a couple of years ago was starting to get a little thin so i treated myself to a new one and keep the old one in reserve.  This product is great if you really like to sleep in the dark.  It blocks out almost all light, is very soft and comfy and has a velcro strap that will fit almost any size head.  My daughter slept over one night and used my old one and has also purchased one for herself.  I would thoroughly recommend this item to anyone who needs or likes to snooze in the dark.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that is is by far the best sleep mask I have used. It is a quality product and you can tell that when you use it. Many of the sleep masks which I had tried in the past did not stand up to nightly use which left a lot to be desired of the product. This product does what it claims to do, provides a great night sleep.</li>
    <li> I read all the overwhelmingly positive reviews for this sleep mask however in my experience, the mask fell short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros:&lt;br /&gt;- The size is nice and large to completely block out all light (unless it shifts... more on that below).&lt;br /&gt;- The material is soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;- The strap is actually part of the whole unit and easily adjustable with the velcro for a snug fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The eye area of the mask should be convex a little so when you tighten the mask down, the material doesn&#x27;t press up against your eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;- Because the material is SO smooth on the inside, if you shift around in your sleep, the mask will slide around your head. It would be better of at least the back part of the strap - the part that goes around the back of your head - were made of a courser material so that it didn&#x27;t slip as much. Because of that, the mask is useless... the cutout for your nose will end up being on the side of your face and then light comes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that if you toss and turn throughout the night, then this is NOT the mask for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the [[ASIN:B0027OUUFW Tempur-Pedic Sleep Mask]] - the eye cups curve outward to take away the pressure on your eyes, the strap is a little more sturdy and the padding around the eyes conforms to your face. (Although I would recommend buying it from the Relax the Back local store - they sell it for around $30 and you can try one on.)</li>
    <li> I ran into the creator of this project in Las Vegas and she was quick to share her enthusiasm with me. After a couple days my mailbox received a sleepmaster mask. It&#x27;s fabulous. I must admit, I can sleep anywhere, and this makes it easier.    I don&#x27;t even care that I may have looked funny putting it on on the airplane, but I put it on and slept like a baby my whole flight.     It&#x27;s the best sleep mask out there!!    The Socialites approve! It&#x27;s now a recommendation on our Holiday Gift Guide for 2009!    Lauralie  [...]  @lauralie_lee  @sinctysocialite  sin.city.socialite@gmail.com</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS MASK!!! I have several different types of masks and I get the most use out of this one. It not only blocks out light but the softly padded mask also helps block sound. And if you use ear plugs, ear buds, or sleep phones (my personal choice), then this mask does an excellent job of keeping them in place. This mask stays on all night regardless of movement. comfortable,  padded mask is so comfortable never painful unlike the kind with the elastic strap that can push down on the tops of the ears causing ppain and discomfoy  comfort when wakening.</li>
    <li> ***GOD GAVE ME THE ANSWER IN MASTERING MY SLEEP WITH THE SLEEP MASTER*** IMPECCABLE AND AGAIN, THE ANSWER TO MY PRAYERS!!! NOTHING LIKE IT, JUST HAD BRAIN TUMOR REMOVED, NOT ONLY SOOTHING TO MY EYES BUT MY HEAD AS WELL. I&#x27;M SLEEPING IN A CLOUD, THANK YOU VERRRRRRRY MUCH! I&#x27;VE HAD A SLEEP MASK IN THE PAST BUT THE SLEEP MASTER OUTWEIGHS THEM ALL!!! THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so upset I purchased this overpriced mask. It does not breathe at all! You will wake up in sweat!</li>
    <li> This mask has several pros and cons. I recently lost it, and have decided to go back to the Tempur-Pedic mask, which I LOVE: http://www.amazon.com/Tempur-Pedic-Sleep-Mask/dp/B0027OUUFW/ref&#x3D;sr_1_4?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;s&#x3D;hpc&amp;qid&#x3D;1295654367&amp;sr&#x3D;8-4.    Pros:  1. It&#x27;s large and blocks out light quite well.  2. It also blocks out a little sound, which is nice and comforting.  3. It doesn&#x27;t bulge out and doesn&#x27;t have any straps that could irritate your ears or prevent you from sleeping comfortably.    Cons:  1. The edges of the mask around the nose were fraying (on the first night) just enough to make me think there was a hair near my nose. It was so bothersome, and I finally figured out it was the edges of the mask fraying slightly. Even after trimming the frays, it feels like there&#x27;s someone bugging me with a feather as I&#x27;m trying to fall asleep - crazy making!  2. This mask is so smooth that it actually slips off in the night. It&#x27;s difficult to get exactly the right tightness that doesn&#x27;t put pressure on your entire head, but doesn&#x27;t slip off from being too loose.  Most mornings I woke up to find the mask was off.  3. It does keep your head quite warm, which I didn&#x27;t mind.  However, an unwanted side-effect is that your hair gets an indentation that is pretty annoying - even after a short nap.    Ok, good luck!  All in all, these masks DO help me sleep much better. I lost mine 2 nights ago and haven&#x27;t been able to get a good night&#x27;s sleep since.  I&#x27;m going to order the Tempur-Pedic one again, though.  It&#x27;s my favorite so far.</li>
    <li> This is the best sleep mask I have ever used! It&#x27;s very plush, soft &amp; silky, and blocks out all the light. Yaayy!! No more streams of light sneaking in through the corners of my mask. Totally worth the money for anyone who uses sleep masks routinely. Also, my shipment arrived two weeks earlier than promised, so I&#x27;m a happy (and well-rested) camper!</li>
    <li> does totally block out light and the material was smooth and was comfortable. didn&#x27;t muffle noise for me though but that wasn&#x27;t a big deal, what i didn&#x27;t like was something kept poking me in the back of the head. rather painful but then i just flipped it to the other side and it didn&#x27;t bug me anymore. after a few nights though i decided that i didn&#x27;t like it covering so much of my face so i just threw it across the room and pulled out an old sleep mask. earplugs were great though. some of my favorites.</li>
    <li> very soft sleep mask. had tried two others before I landed on this. cant even tell you have it on after a while.back adjusts to whatever size you like so no ellastic to make it too tight</li>
    <li> Morning sunlight streaming through my bedroom window always wakes me up.  Even though Saturdays are the one day I can sleep in and my curtains are drawn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sleep Master Sleep Mask is the best product that I have purchased.  It is extremely comfortable, I can wear even if I roll onto my stomach, and it blocks out all the light from the morning sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently took a 16 hour flight to the Phillipines, and I wore it on the plane.  It worked great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also great for blocking out the light if you suffer from Migraine headaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly recommend this product to anyone who requires this type of an aid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;StuckNCorona</li>
    <li> I have bought many things on Amazon, and the feedback is a great help.  For this product I guess I ignored or didn&#x27;t read the 1 star reviews since there were so many good reviews.  Big mistake!!!    I shelled out the money for this product instead of trying cheaper alternatives because I thought given the price and the reviews I could expect to have a completely light-free day of sleep (with my job I work some graveyard shifts).  Boy, was I WAAAAAAAYYYYY wrong!!!  I found this mask to be comfortable, but beyond that, it let in far too much light around the nose area.  I have tried everything to try to make it work better.  From trying to bend it to tightening/loosening, whatever...but to no avail.    This product turned out to be a $25 waste of money.  I&#x27;m just going to eat the loss and chalk it up to experience.  I urge you to not make the same mistake.</li>
    <li> The mask came much sooner than I expected. It&#x27;s very comfortable and comes with earplugs if you need them.  For a very reasonable price, I got a dark bedroom. Great quality and great service. -- Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> Finally, a sleep mask that stays on my head and blocks out the light. This mask is great!  If you have trouble with sleep masks not blocking out the light around your nose area and you toss and turn all night, so your mask usually pop off your head at some point during the night, then this mask is for you.</li>
    <li> My new sleep mask just arrived - it is exactly as was described - very high quality, comfortable, attractive and adjusts to fit all head sizes. This mask block 100% of the light and even muffles noise. I&#x27;ve been anticipating its arrival and it did not disappoint - I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Like my Buckys much better. This one is pressing against your eyes and lashes making it hard and uncomfortable to blink. I did not notice the voice reduction either...</li>
    <li> I am sad that I am returning this as it does a great job of blocking out the light.&lt;br /&gt;My problem is that I have a medical condition and I have to sleep, propped up, in an adjustable bed. I use a memory foam pillow, and because I can&#x27;t sleep on my side, the velcro bulge on the back presses uncomfortably into the back of my head.&lt;br /&gt;So if you sleep on your back, with a firm pillow, this might not be for you.&lt;br /&gt;I would still recommend it though, if you don&#x27;t have specialized problems such as myself, if you want a comfy mask that can block the light. Maybe it would work better for back sleepers with the velcro on the side instead of the back of the head.</li>
    <li> This product rocks. My husband and I can sleep in the same bed again! It&#x27;s like sleeping in a silky soft bubble. I love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this sleep mask for 6 months now.  I used to toss and turn before falling asleep and wake up a few hours later only to have trouble again getting back to sleep.  This mask is comfortable and creates a sense of peace so I now fall asleep quickly and rarely awaken until morning.  It is higher priced than the ones I have bought in the past, but it is washable and durable and is still in perfect shape after all these months of nightly use--Plus, getting a good night&#x27;s sleep is priceless.  I highly recommend the Sleep Master</li>
    <li> The SLEEP MASTER is great. Now instead of tossing and turning all night in the pale glow of my neighbor&#x27;s backyard light, I toss and turn all night in complete darkness. It effectively shuts out all light.  It&#x27;s comfortable and you don&#x27;t feel it when you wear it.  It&#x27;s a wrap around mask so it helps cut down on any noises.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a very long time since I&#x27;ve had a sleep mask I liked (and boy do I have a collection). I look for something that will stay on, keep my eyes closed, and doesn&#x27;t have elastic that will wear out. This does exactly that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s so wide around the ears it does muffle sound, but it&#x27;s not noise cancellation by any means. It&#x27;s very soft and the cut out for the nose is great while keeping the light out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I bought this is because one of the questions about eye pressure indicated this might help keep my eyes closed. Normally, 25 is too much to pay for a mask to me, but I don&#x27;t regret it because it&#x27;s great for me. Is it worth the price? I don&#x27;t know about you. Looking at it, I feel you could easily make this yourself, but if you don&#x27;t already get crafty like this, the cost of the materials and your time would probably balance out to 25 anyway. It&#x27;s just fabric, padding, and velcro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I still feel like it might slip off, and because my head is so small, there is only about an inch of velcro that is actually useful to me. I might glue on some more to help with that, but I haven&#x27;t had an issue with it coming off yet. I do also sleep with a stretchy night cap for my hair, so the cap and the mask might &#x27;grab&#x27; each other to prevent that. I can&#x27;t quite tell, and the mask is so silky smooth it&#x27;s hard to imagine that&#x27;d make a difference.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this sleep mask. He tried others and nothing beats this mask. It doesn&#x27;t pinch his ears and is very comfortable to sleep with. Great service, would shop again.</li>
    <li> My wife, read about Sleep Master and thought it would help me sleep.  I&#x27;ve never liked sleep masks before, but this sleep mask is very different.  The first thing you notice is the quality and comfortable fit.  It seems as if the mask was designed specifically for me.  It feels so natural and doesn&#x27;t get caught on the pillow, as I tend to toss and turn a lot,  and the fabric is soft and cool.  The mask is easily adjustable and extremely durable (you can wash it without a worry).  Since using this mask, I fall asleep quickly, and sleep uninterrupted for hours, which was rare for me!  I can sleep deeply in any environment, and naps are wonderful.  When I awake, I feel re-charged, focused and ready to go.  I&#x27;m getting the best rest I&#x27;ve had in years.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> never tried a \\&quot;sleep mask\\&quot; before.  told a friend I was having trouble sleeping and referred me to this mask.  Was reluctent at first, but for $20 or so, worth a try.  I didn&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d even be able to sleep with something over my face.  I was extremely happy and suprised.  Fell alseep much quicker and stayed alseep for almost 7 hours straight (that&#x27;s really good for me).  I&#x27;ve had over 3 weeks now and still happy.  Really confortable.  I&#x27;ve even been using it for an occasional nap.  I&#x27;m flying in a few weeks and look forward to maybe even actually sleeping on a plane!  Phil</li>
    <li> I mainly purchased this product for the noise reduction. My husband snores terribly and I sleep with earplugs every night (only the waxy ones work) and I am getting sick of it! So I thought this might be a good alternative. Plus...I desperately try to black out my bedroom but there is always a sliver of light shining through that wakes me (yes I am a VERY light sleeper). So I received this the other day and was so excited to try it out. First off, the fact that they are even legally allowed to advertise this as having noise reduction is a joke!!! It provides zero noise reduction or muffling!! Cup your hand lightly over your ear and that is the equaivalent of what this does. And then the nose issue. Man....all the light comes in at the nose and I couldnt fix it. Its almost worse then having all over light because it was like a tractor beam of light going directly in my eye.     I am not sure where all the positive reviews come from. Im not usually one to jump instantly to the fact that the good reviews are plants....but man, this was so way off I have to think they were!!! No one in their right mind would claim this reduced noise in any way for them. Maybe my nose is mis-shaped and thats why I had a problem with the light as well. But the noise??? No answer for that!!!</li>
    <li> I had bought the Hybermate sleep mask last time I bought one.  I looked, and theirs are now $40 plus shipping from Australia.  So, I decided this one looked similar, was much cheaper, and would cost less for shipping.  I love it.  It is a little hot because it covers more area than the Hybermate, but it&#x27;s not bad if your room is cool.  It is satin on the inside and outside.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if that would be the case when I ordered it.  But it is so nice.  I love it, and I am glad I didn&#x27;t pay $40 for the Hybermate.</li>
    <li> The sleep mask is great. Have another one but it just didn&#x27;t work for me. But this one is so comfortable and it does keep out the light so sleep is a piece of cake. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this sleep mask! It blocks out all the light that keeps me from falling asleep. I&#x27;ve tried many masks over the years and this is the best!  I do wish it was offered in a fabric other than satin as the satin can potentially slide off your head but it&#x27;s great and I will be purchasing another for travel.</li>
    <li> The Sleep Master mask is everything that was promised. I especially like the way they reinforce the stitching in some places -- like extra tight sewing around the nose. The high quality velcro seems built to last (I&#x27;ve had problems with this in other masks) and the width of all parts really maximizes the masks ability to block out light. I can&#x27;t say enough about this purchase.</li>
    <li> I am used to sleeping with a contour sleep mask, so this took a little getting use to because it touches your eyelids (like most normal sleep masks do). Once I was used to the feel I absolutely love it! It is soft and doesn&#x27;t get to hot to wear at night. I really like that my hair doesn&#x27;t get caught in the velcro in the back like it did with my old mask. I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> As soon as I used it the first night I loved it. I didn&#x27;t even need to use the ear plugs that were included. This works great it covers the eyes and ears well. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be swayed by hype such as \\&quot;revolutionary, patented.\\&quot;  This sleep mask is uncomfortable because it lacks eye cups.  That means your eye lashes rub against it.  It allows significant light to penetrate, despite its large size, because its contour is poor.  Claims that it blocks sounds are fraud.  It doesn&#x27;t block sound at all, and neither is there anything to its design that suggests it might.  Finally, returns are difficult.  The merchant is confrontational and defense.  In particular, they refuse returns for any package that has been opened.  But then, these masks are shipped in ordinary Zip-lock bags, which means there is no way for the merchant to know whether a mask has been used.  I have owned several competing brands of sleep masks.  All of them were cheaper, and all of them were more functional.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is top notch quality and the reason I&#x27;m ordering a second is that my partner happens to love it as well and so I must get a 2nd.  This is the first sleep mask I have ever worn.  I make sure I research many of the things I plan to buy online extensively before spending my hard earned money on it.  Well, all of the time reading reviews paid off and just wanted to let everyone who likes complete darkness during sleep to know that this is the one to buy.  Yes, it is a little pricier than many of the standard masks out there, but just look at the photo.... this is not your standard sleep mask!  It is so comfortable for me to sleep and now find that I cannot sleep without it.  I have made it an integral part of trying to achieve as much sensory deprivation as possible during my sleep.  I happen to be a very light sleeper and since I live with 2 others that are on different work schedules, I want to make sure my sleep time is uninterrupted.  The other part of my routine involves a sound track called Snoreraser that blocks out even the most annoying sounds.  I downloaded that to my my computer which I stream to my bedroom via Logitech&#x27;s Squeezebox.  I then plug my Sleephones into my Internet radio audio jack and put them on. BTW, Sleephones are the best thing I have discovered for a good night&#x27;s sleep.  I happen to be on my 2nd set of those headphones/sleephones :  So with my Snoreraser playing via my Squeezebox with my Sleephones positioned on my head, I then place this ever so comfortable sleep mask over my headphones and I have complete audio and visual deprivation.  The audio track also helps induce sleep using certain audio wavelengths and I happen to have some pretty awesome dreams letting my mind do the directing instead of any outside sounds/light.  Then promptly at 6:15am, my squeezebox is set to wake me up which it does by cutting off the streaming audio track I have been listening to (on repeat) all night and uses the alarm sound of my choice (of which are many to choose from) and wakes me up.  So, as you can see I take my sleep very serious and all of these items play an important part of me getting complete uninterrupted sleep.  Now, if only I can figure out what to do with my bladder waking me up before I want to..... LOL!!which are many to choose from) and wakes me up.  So, as you can see I take my sleep very serious and all of these items play an important part of me getting complete uninterrupted sleep.  Now, if only I can figure out what to do with my bladder waking me up before I want to..... LOL!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of sleep masks, and this is the ONLY one that works comfortably for me, as I am a side and stomach sleeper. I could see it being a bit less comfortable for a back sleeper (velcro on the back), but I have no direct experience of that. Customer service is prompt and personable - they seem like a great company.</li>
    <li> I like the adjustable size of this (velcro) but the texture is very slippery, so this easily slips off if you move at all while sleeping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many in the past only to soon toss them in a drawer or in the trash because they either didn&#x27;t work or were too uncomfortable -- or simply slid off during the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sleep Master Sleep Mask was on the pricey side, but based on the customer reviews I decided to give it a try. And I&#x27;m very glad I did. It took me a couple days to get used to it, as it wraps all the way around your head and secures with Velcro, so I tended to wrap it a little too tightly at first. Then I had to find the right spot so my nose would poke through just right to be comfortable and yet not let in light. Once I found the sweet spot, I now can put it on automatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you wear ear plugs, this sleep mask enhances their noise-blocking abilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not perfect (I don&#x27;t think any sleep mask is) because a little light can peek in from under the nose area sometimes -- not always -- but sometimes. But never enough to wake me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great thing about the Sleep Master is that it&#x27;s machine washable (hang dry). It&#x27;s getting hot as summer approaches and unless my air-conditioning is cranked to the max (which is not going to happen as the wife doesn&#x27;t like it too cool), I tend to sweat. And quite frankly the mask gets a bit damp from sweat. But I air it out and wash it frequently and it&#x27;s holding up great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can sleep in any position with this mask -- on my side, back, stomach. All with perfect comfort. I never feel the strap because there really isn&#x27;t one. The wraparound design is quite clever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this product two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a sleep mask for years and it was beginning to fall apart, so I did some research and decided to try the Sleep Master mask.  It just arrived and I tried it on, then rushed to my computer to write this review.    The mask COMPLETELY blocks light out.  When I wear the mask and look at my sunlit picture window I can&#x27;t see even a glimmer of light.  The mask&#x27;s wraparound design stops light leakage from the sides, and the nose cutout allows you to adjust to mask to block light seepage from that area as well.    The Sleep Master also feels much cooler than my previous mask, which was often sweaty after a night&#x27;s sleep.  Also, as someone who sleeps on his back I don&#x27;t find the velcro closure that wraps around the back of the head to be disturbing at all.   I don&#x27;t believe the mask will block significant amounts of sound, but if you visit the Sleep Master site the manufacturers say as much.      If you&#x27;re looking for a mask that will fully block light and be comfortable, this product seems ideal.  I haven&#x27;t experienced a night&#x27;s sleep with the mask yet nor can I attest to its durability, but I expect they will both be superb.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS MASK! I will never buy another kind. I will wear this one out and then buy this one again. I don&#x27;t sleep well at all if there&#x27;s any light coming in anywhere from anything and this one is perfect! Took it to Alaska with me this last Summer. Worked great on the plane and on the trip. I use it at home when I need a nap during the day or just that added darkness for a regular night&#x27;s sleep. Thanks so much for creating such a great sleep mask![[ASIN:B0015NZ6FK Revolutionary, Patented SLEEP MASTER Sleep Mask]]</li>
    <li> I bought this with the intention of it replacing the folded t-shirt I usually place over my eyes. The shirt actually works better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1) It presses on the eyes, even if not adjusted tightly&lt;br /&gt;2) It slides off or slides around every time, and any way, I move my head, no matter how tight it is&lt;br /&gt;3) It manages to catch on the pillow even with all the velcro covered&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The folded t-shirt? Yah, it falls off, too, but at least it stays on long enough for me to fall asleep.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like the part that covers my ears but other than that its great</li>
    <li> I have a terrible time with the slightest amount of light and birds waking me up as early as 4:30 in the morning.  I have tried other sleep masks but the velcro strap would always give me a terrible headache.  This is nice because it wraps around my head, it does velcro but no thin strap to cut into the back of my head.  Its silk type material is very nice and comfortable.  It covers my ears just enough that the birds aren&#x27;t waking me anymore and I am sleeping until 7 or 8 now, this is huge for me.  Customer service was also super prompt in getting me a new one when mine arrived slightly defective.</li>
    <li> A little bit of light creeps in from the sides, but it is more comfortable than some other blindfolds that use foam. Unlike foam blindfolds, which make me break out, this one does not irritate my skin</li>
    <li> We are night workers, sleeping during the day. We&#x27;ve done this for years, and have tried at least 20+ different sleep masks to cut out light and help w/ sleep. This is by far the nicest, most comfortable mask that TOTALLY keeps the light out. It is so soft on your skin and back of head (where most masks definitely fail) and securely adjustable.  The width is also a huge reason to buy--the wide contours make it a silky custom fit for your face and it does cover your ears for a little added benefit w/sounds!  We both are sleeping deeper because of the above, but also because we&#x27;re not fighting w/ a mask&#x27;s elastic band and having it slide all around. Would pay 10x the price or more for the benefit of this sleep. So from daysleepers to our fellow problem sleepers out there, we wholeheartedly recommend this without reservation.  We even tried to come up w/some negatives for a \\&quot;balanced review\\&quot;, but the only negative we came up with was that we didn&#x27;t find it sooner! BEST BUY!! THANKS SO MUCH Sleep Master!</li>
    <li> The fabric is soft and feels very much like silk. Wearing it, I tend to take longer and fuller naps. It blocks out most to all light without hampering breathing at all. I could easily keep one of these in my car and one at home. Owning this has given me insight into how sensitive my eyes are, even when closed. I highly recommended this product.</li>
    <li> Where do I start  -- oh yeah, let&#x27;s start with the fact that it&#x27;s Made in the flipping USA!!!  If I could give extra stars for that, I would.  I highly recommend this product.  I have a hard time sleeping due to the fact that I am very light sensitive.  I have had countless sleep masks, but none of them compare to this beauty.  I love the soft and sleek material.  It blocks all light, and muffles some sound.  I love that this product has a Velcro closure, and isn&#x27;t cheap elastic that can become stretched out over time.  They&#x27;ve thought of everything.  Buy this.  And finally get a good night of sleep.</li>
    <li> I have used eye masks and ear plugs for a couple of years now, ever since staying at a hotel in the flight path of Miami International Airport.  After that \\&quot;complimentary hotel\\&quot; mask started wearing out, I went in search of a long term option and picked this mask.  It is excellent, comfortable for the most part (more on that shortly), stays in place, etc..  The best feature for me is the wide straps over the ears.  One of the drawbacks for most eye masks is that they have a narrow strap.  I tend to sleep on my side, and without covering from a wide strap, the ear plugs can work their way loose.    The only drawback for me is that the mask is flat over the eye area, which can cause a little too much eye pressure.  If this had some kind of cupped design like other masks, I would give it 5 stars in a heartbeat.  What I wound up doing was getting a cupped design eye mask and wearing it underneath this one.  It works for me - but would love to have a \\&quot;one mask\\&quot; solution.</li>
    <li> One of the top masks I have tried.  My wife likes this one as it is very wide going around her head and she finds this comfortable.  Good coverage for light as well.  Even covers your ears a bit to block some sound, read snoring by me!</li>
    <li> For me this is a total fail.  Unfortunately, I put it aside and didn&#x27;t try it until the 30 day return period had passed or I would have just returned it for a refund.  It does seem to be well made, with quality materials but it doesn&#x27;t block out the light very well and it presses against my eyelids, which I wouldn&#x27;t mind except that it causes my eyes to get gummy.  Also, I have to use a c-pap machine with \\&quot;air pillows\\&quot; for sleep apnea and this mask doesn&#x27;t play well with my \\&quot;air pillows\\&quot;.  It is comfortable and the way it covers the ears seems pretty cool but the basic function of the mask is supposed to be to cover the eyes so that light doesn&#x27;t penetrate and it clearly fails on that point. I guess it&#x27;s great for some people but I&#x27;m not one of them.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband and I did a lot of research. Others out there may have been less expensive but this one actually is comfortable, not bulky and stays in place. My husband is thrilled with it. He doesn&#x27;t like any light when he sleeps and this mask does the trick. It can be washed but just to prevent from wearing it out I would rinse your face before you put it on if you have oily skin. The material is so soft and my husband couldn&#x27;t be happier.  This is awesome! My husband loves it and I am so glad I chose this one over the others due to it&#x27;s comfortability</li>
    <li> This is the only mask I&#x27;ve ever used that lets me sleep in real darkness in a room that isn&#x27;t dark!  If you&#x27;re sensitive to light and your partner reads at night while you&#x27;re trying to sleep, you know how miserable it is.  This product puts an end to misery.  It blocks all light, is very soft and comfortable, and is totally adjustable.  It also comes with a pair of earplugs that fit in my ears perfectly.  Other earplugs I&#x27;ve tried have fallen out or have let sounds in.  These don&#x27;t do either one, and I no longer hear any unwelcome night noises.  My victory over light and sound is complete, and I sleep really, really well.</li>
    <li> I travel a lot for work and prefer a completely dark room while I sleep. This is not always possible when trying to sleep during the day. I&#x27;ve tried cheaper versions of sleep masks but always found that the elastic was irritating. I paid a little more money for this mask and highly recommend it. It fits nicely and feels good against the skin. Would buy this again.</li>
    <li> The mask is very comfortable, like a pillow. It blocks out all light if you wear it with the pressure over your eyes. This, however, will actually make your vision blurry when you wake up because of the continuous pressure on your eyes. I had to wear this mask a little higher on my face than usual, and a lot looser than usual. So it does let light in through the nose area because of that. It is good for people with sunken eyes because the pressure is distributed naturally on the brow. But for people like me with a shallow face, I would recommend wearing the mask very loosely or looking into a mask that has eye cavities.</li>
    <li> Noise and light bothers me when I sleep since I&#x27;m a light sleeper and I wanted a mask that covered both issues. The item was delivered in a hurry, the item was as described and now I&#x27;m sleeping much better with my \\&quot;sleep master sleep mask\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Err, I have to agree with some of the negatives around here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Positives:&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s very comfortable.  Most masks I&#x27;ve tried have a very uncomfortable thin strap along the back.  Not this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. This one has very good coverage over the eyes.  I don&#x27;t see light at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now onto the Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;1. Not so sure the quality was the same as when I got it. It doesn&#x27;t feel as good anymore, as if it&#x27;s stretched out or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. This mask should&#x27;ve been contoured around the eyes. I have to be really careful when tightening this mask because I&#x27;ll otherwise wake up with sore eyeballs, and as one reviewer mentioned, really tired as if I couldn&#x27;t get REM sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve degraded my rating down to a 3 star due to the two negatives previously mentioned.  I&#x27;ve now had my mask for about a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, if you&#x27;re attempting to wear earphones while sleeping, and put on this mask, the strap isn&#x27;t long enough.  I would find some sort of velcro extension.  That&#x27;s how it works for me, but then again, I do have a big head.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! It is very soft and comfortable, and secure while sleeping, especially for someone who sleeps on their stomach, like me! I am very pleased. I bought two more as gifts!</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is the best I have ever used. If it were in Purple I would order it again. I have been wearing this for about 4 years now. Still no complaints. Washes up great. I simply love this mask by Sleep Master!!!</li>
    <li> I hesitated at buying this product as it seemed a little indulgent... &amp; I already have a travel sleep mask which I use on planes...but having moved to a country that does not do put clocks forward in Spring, I find myself being woken up at 4.30am with BRIGHT, BRIGHT sunshine &amp; the noise of wild life... &amp; no matter how tired I am, I cannot go back to sleep. So I took the plunge &amp; it was worth every penny of the price &amp; shipping...The only negative thing I have to say is that, they are so comfortable...my husband nicks them, so it looks like I&#x27;ll be buying another pair very soon</li>
    <li> An INCREDIBLE product. Being a person with difficulties sleeping, this has been an insanely marvelous purchase. Plus, it was fast to arrive, not too expensive, and it came with earplugs which are brill. Very happy..</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for, extremely soft yet thick fabric to block the light, also gently covers the ears as well (huge plus), &amp; uses a very comfortable and convenient velcro to adjust the size (no annoying rubber bands).    I really loved it the moment I tried it &amp; ordered another one so I could alternate when washing.</li>
    <li> After moving to Florida and getting a job on a night shift I never thought I would get enough of the deep sleep I needed to work twelve hour shifts, but with Sleep Master it&#x27;s no problem.   It&#x27;s comfortable and blocks all light completely so I can get the sleep I need. And with a set of ear plugs my wife can go about her life as normal in the house without fear of waking me up!</li>
    <li> I have used other sleep masks in the past but this one exceeded my expectations because not only does it block out the light completely but it is very comfortable . The material is very soft but resilant and I would highly recommend this sleep mask to anyone wanting to get a good nights sleep!!</li>
    <li> This mask is essentially a blindfold (imagine wrapping a folded towel around your head). When the mask is tightened enough to block light and allow it to remain in place all night, it is uncomfortably tight across the eyes. It really puts a lot of downward pressure on the eyes. The fabric slips on hair and is therefore prone to fall off during the night. I suspect a satin pillowcase would reduce friction between the mask and pillowcase and allow the mask to stay in place longer at night. Since buying this mask three months ago and finding it uncomfortable and annoying (falls off during the night), I purchased a Comfort Sleep Mask from Walgreens with cupped eye patches that is far more confortable, stays in place all night, and costs a quarter of what the Sleep Master sleep mask costs.</li>
    <li> best sleeping mask i&#x27;ve ever used, greatly increased my quality of sleep, best light reduction in a sleeping mask, very comfortable</li>
    <li> Best sleep mask Ive owned to date. No elastic to stretch out, Velcro. You can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> Could this item be any better? Just one possibility...more color choices and in brighter exterior&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;colors.  Interior color of darkness is spot on. It is soft, very lightweight, cushion comfort,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;durable and will be so easy to clean or sanitize if used by more than one person.  With soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ear plugs used with it, who could ask for anything more?  The velcro rear straps make the mask&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;convenient to put on or remove as quickly as the user wishes. The option being to simply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;slide it vertically from your head and then undo the velcro. Once in place you have genuine darkness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and are all set for a snooze of any duration...power nap or a good sleep.  Who Could Ask For&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anything More?  Reasonably priced as a bonus. Thanks to this company, which demonstrates an&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ideal level of customer service and follow-up and through. Signed...long-time railroad train&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;traveller back and forth around the country...short and long journeys. Thumbs Up, Indeed!</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is INCREDIBLE.  It is amazing to me how much of a difference it can make providing a good night sleep.  I have a hard time getting to sleep.  I can spend hours tossing and turning trying to get to sleep.  Then I got this sleep mask and now I can get to sleep in minutes.  If ever I have a bad night trying to sleep, I just put this mask on and I go right to sleep.  It has great durability.  I have had one for over a year and still worked well and stayed just a comfortable as the first day I got it.  I probably didn&#x27;t replace it as quickly as I could have, but it just kept working so well.  I kept waiting for it not to work anymore and it never did. I recommend it to anyone who had trouble sleeping.  I tell all my friend about it and give them away as gifts.  This product is fantastic.</li>
    <li> Not sure what the 1 stars are about, the only problem I would say would be the ear plugs get annoying, but I don&#x27;t use them at all. I just use the mask and it&#x27;s fine the way it is. You can just use different ear plugs and they&#x27;d prob work the same way. The mask itself is fine, I&#x27;ve used it for over a week and no problems at all, it helps me get to sleep easily and quick. Does not allow light to come in, and silk feels nice on the face. I wash it often, pretty much everyday. High quality and highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I work nights and I&#x27;m also the kind of person that can&#x27;t sleep if there&#x27;s even the tiniest bit of light from a tv LED, or monitor LED.   This mask is good because it doesn&#x27;t have elastic bands that&#x27;ll wear out over time.  It doesn&#x27;t allow any light in at all, so daylight sleeping is not a problem.</li>
    <li> My Sleep Master sleep mask arrived exactly on time and the quality was even better than I expected.  The fabric feels soft on my face, the velcro closure is comfortable, secure, and perfectly adjustable, and it&#x27;s DARK in there!  I&#x27;m so glad I spent the extra few dollars and got this mask rather than another ineffective $10 one.</li>
    <li> Excellent mask -- the best &#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable, works great! Well worth the money if you need to block out light and some sound. I am very pleased with it!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I am light sensitive and my husband likes to have the window open for air.  It covers the face really good and keeps the light out.  I really like this face mask the only thing I have a issue with is that it does get warm.  I would still recommend it though good product.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I finally found a product I can use that is comfortable and also is effective. I use it traveling and so it takes a lot of abuse.  The mask feels soft and fits very well. I am relieved to find something made so well and designed so well.  I would recommend this product to who ever requires an easy to wear and effective deterrent to annoying light in ones sleep environment.</li>
    <li> bought this for my wife due to she has to work at night and sleep during the day. she likes her curtains and didn&#x27;t want to have to buy the blackout ones, so this was the alternative. she says it&#x27;s extremely comfortable, and doesn&#x27;t bother her to wear it when she is sleeping at all. she highly recommends this product to others</li>
    <li> I love my SLEEP MASTER Sleep Mask. It is soft, dark blue. With a tranquil effect. It block&#x27;s most of all the light with the exception of the crease around the nose. I find it very comfortable. Adjustable with a Velcro fitting. I was surprised to find ear plugs that came with it. I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I go to bed late and my girlfriend gets up around 5am. My girlfriend needs to turn on the lights in the room causing me to get broken sleep. After getting this mask, I was able to get a full 8 hours without being woken up by light.</li>
    <li> I wish i had this when i worked night shift.  I never realized how much better i sleep with the light blocked out. The mask also comes with soft earplugs at no cost.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask smelled scented, like perfume when I opened the box.  It was strong and offensive to me.  I hand washed it in soap and water to try and wash the smell out.  The smell did not come out.  I tried sleeping with it anyway but the smell was so strong it kept waking me up.  I gave up trying to sleep with it and threw it into the laundry basket to try a machine washing.  If the smell did not come out I was going to return the mask.  Apparently and unfortunately, my beagle found the smell as offensive as I did, fished the mask out of the laundry basket and tore it up.  This mask does let some light in through the bottom, about as much as the $6 mask I ended up buying at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond.</li>
    <li> I am an incurable insomniac!!  I haven&#x27;t slept all night in over a decade.  If a gnat sneezes, I wake up.  I&#x27;ve tried sleeping pills, herbal remedies, other sleep masks....I would get to sleep then I would be awakened by some noise and not be able to get back to sleep.  Sleep deprivation was sending me into depression and my health was being negatively affected.  Last night I used my Sleep Master mask with the ear plugs and I slept ALL NIGHT!  If you have a lot of trouble sleeping, then you&#x27;ll understand my excitement.  I slept ALL NIGHT and I feel rested this morning!  That is a MAJOR accomplishment for me! I feel rested this morning, my eye sight is not so blurry, my breathing is better.  Not sleeping was really affecting me in a negative way.  I live in an apartment complex with a lot of young people who like to party late into the night, and it woke me up every night.  Not last night with the Sleep Master sleep mask and ear plugs.  I slept through it!!  I&#x27;m so excited!!  I don&#x27;t want to spoil someone else good time because of my problem and now I have the solution!! They can party and I can sleep!  It&#x27;s WONDERFUL!!!!  Thank-you so much for this amazing sleep mask!!!! It really works!!</li>
    <li> This mask is very comfortable, and excellent at blocking light. Unlike cheaper masks with elastic strings, it fits very well. I sleep very well wearing it and I would recommend this mask over others. It is well worth the asking price.</li>
    <li> Love the sound proofing and that there is no pressure on the temples.  I can actually lay/sleep on my side an be comfortable.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Wonderfully soft!  I had eye surgery in the past and needed something soft so that I will not rub my eyes in my sleep.  This is wonderful. Very pleased with the quality of this product!</li>
    <li> Wow--I&#x27;m surprised at how verbose some people can be in reviewing a sleep mask! Let&#x27;s see if I can keep it short.    This is my first sleep mask, and it works; I&#x27;m pleased with that. But because it covers the ears, body sounds (heartbeat, swallowing, etc.) are amplified; that&#x27;s a problem for me, and it&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t use ear plugs for sleeping.    The mask also gets warm--which is good in winter, bad in summer.    That&#x27;s about it. OK, but I&#x27;m back to shopping.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I checked out the comments on Amazon to figure out which sleep mask to purchase. This saved me lots of time of trying different masks because it has worked perfectly. Thank you to all the commentators on Amazon for saving me time and money.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Gave it to my dad for Fathers Day as he has been wanting one forever. He was shocked at the quality and how great it works. Thank you</li>
    <li> Fits comfortably. The velcro does not create an uncomfortable &#x27;bump&#x27;.  No light bleed.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;WONDERFUL SLEEPING MASK!! I&#x27;ve had my share and this is the first one to totally block out light and it&#x27;s exceptionally comfortable!! Anyone with sleeping problems, or that needs complete darkness when sleeping I highly recommend this sleeping mask!!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Purchased this item after reading the rave reviews. Took much longer than i&#x27;m accustomed to with amazon to ship (hence the 4 out of 5). I can&#x27;t speak as to the effectiveness of this sleep mask vs others, as this is my first one. The quality of this product appears to be very good, with attention to detail being a commom theme. After spending years in the military finding every possible way to get comfortable while sleeping in any condition known to man, I still cannot honestly say that this provides me the relief I was hoping for. Its cumbersome on the face and is uncomfortable for both me and my wife. When applied, it feel like someone just came up behind you and put their hands over your eyes just to say \\&quot;guess who\\&quot;. May work wonders for others but not this guy. The only time I could see myself wearing this mask in the future would be on an airplane where ambient light would be an issue during long hauls.</li>
    <li> Fits good and I have a large head (I use a 3X motorcycle helmet) I&#x27;m retired and travel 10 or more months of the year. I stay in hostels and someone always comes in late the lights come on and there is no light that gets in.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cool by any means.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is wonderful. My husband likes to have the television on playing soothing music at night. I like the music but not the light. This sleep mask solved the problem. It is comfortable and adjustable, and also comes with ear plugs, although I do not use the ear plugs.</li>
    <li> This mask really works and it is very comfortable. You can forget you are even wearing it because the material is so soft.</li>
    <li> The Sleep Master sleep mask is great and I&#x27;m very picky!  Very high quality. Although it appears a little bulkier than ordinary sleep masks, it&#x27;s really unobtrusive. Very soft, smooth and comforting.  I think it works well for blocking out ambient light. Sturdy, well made and stands up well to washing. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I ever used an eye mask. I suggested to my wife that we get curtains to block out some of the light but she suggested a mask. Wanting to save a few bucks, I took a chance on the Sleep Master and man oh man, I haven&#x27;t slept this deeply in years. It&#x27;s perfect. I don&#x27;t get sweaty or choked. It fell off a couple times but I just need to tighten it up a bit. Thank You!!</li>
    <li> Love, love love this mask! It is so soft and comfortable.  And I think it also helps with noise reduction.</li>
    <li> I like the large eye size but not the part that goes around your head.  I don&#x27;t like to be hot and this design plasters my hair to my head and I wake up hot. Also, all my movement at night causes the whole thing to slide up.  If I tighten it I am even hotter and my hair is wetter.  A good velcro strap about an inch wide maybe even adjustable would be better but leave the eye part wide like it is.</li>
    <li> This mask is comfortable, soothing, completely blocks out the light and molds to the size of your head.  I am getting a better&lt;br /&gt;nights sleep because of this product.  I gave one to my Sister &amp; Daughter, and they are as thrilled with the mask as I am.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> The first one I had was black and stained my pillows, but after contacting the seller I got the blue one which works great. I still use it today after 3 years. But after repeated washings the edges get a little frayed and it tickles my face when falling asleep. I usually just cut them off or have a nightcap to fall asleep quicker. Overall though, it blocks out a lot of sound and is pitch black when placed properly over the eyes. This and my sound machine are a perfect combination.</li>
    <li> Bought the most expensive mask on Amazon, and it&#x27;s terrible. Awful design, plus the way the nose is stitched, it digs in and is rough on your skin. Ugh. You could make a better mask than this yourself out of nearly any fabric, (it&#x27;s a simple band with a nose notch) and you should, because it could not possibly be worse than this one. Because it&#x27;s satin on the inside, it slips off your head the first time you turn over. Nothing is right about this thing, it&#x27;s a failed design, and it&#x27;s comical that they&#x27;re so proud of it. Fail. However, this has inspired me to make a sleep mask that actually fits a human head, doesn&#x27;t fall off, and generally does not suck. Mine will also be made of the finest natural materials, like organic hemp. Thanks, Sleep Master, for making something inferior enough to inspire me to compete!&lt;br /&gt;[Sleep Master reached out to me and offered me a free mask because I erroneously left them a bad seller review.  They are a very good seller, actually, this mask just didn&#x27;t work for me, and I stand by my comments, harsh as they are.  I am however upgrading to three stars.  The replacement one had better stitching at the nose, fwiw.  Now, despite returning it, I have one.  Anybody want it?  If you have a tiny nose, it may work for you...]</li>
    <li> It works great at keeping out the light. I even got my mom one it works so well. The only problem is that some times it gets to hot.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great mask, I&#x27;d say far better than the 2 basic sleep masks I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a great job blocking light and feels awesome.  I think the feel of wearing it alone helps put me to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;The design and material is awesome.  How it wraps around the head as one piece feels great compared to an elastic band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only flaw, as others have noted is it does easily slip off.  I&#x27;ve had it for a week or so now and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever woken up with it still covering my eyes.  If I&#x27;m not ready to wake up I just put it back on and I easily fall back to sleep.</li>
    <li> Comfy, I like it. Kept it on the whole first night and really seemed to help. Today I feel fresh and the satin was a nice touch to the skin. Kind of like having undies on your head all night.</li>
    <li> Best sleep mask I&#x27;ve ever had. Blocks 99% of light, isn&#x27;t too tight, space for your nose, slightly blocks noise.</li>
    <li> this just doesn&#x27;t fit right, in order to keep it on it has to be so tight around the head that it puts pressure on your eyes making it at least for me unwearable, yes I did try loosening it and then it moved as I moved my head on the pillow, maybe OK on a plane or for a nap in a chair when sat upright</li>
    <li> While this mask prevents light from reaching your eyes, the fact that it extends over your ears creates an annoying scratching noise whenever you turn your head over the pillow. It&#x27;s really a bad design since there was no reason to extend it over your ears. They should definitely revise it. My 5 dollars mask from Duane Read does a better job. AVOID BUYING THIS ITEM!!!!</li>
    <li> These are comfortable enough but I have to loosen them too much so they are comfortable on my eyes. Then because they are so loose they move around on my head. I guess I need to try one of the masks that keep a bit of space over the eyes.</li>
    <li> Excellent workmanship, comfortable and attractive, blocks all light and adjusts to all size heads-beats my flimsy, elastic-banded mask any day- would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have purchased a few sleep masks, gave a review to one of them, they were not bad but I have always had a problem with them irritating and chafing my ears, there is no such problem with this mask, it is very soft, washes easily, if you use ointments or whatnot at night they come right off in a gentle wash.. it is soft and wraps as tight or light as you want.. one of the reviews here on top of being really comical convinced me that I should give it a try.. now I wish I hadn&#x27;t purchased the other sleep masks.. I&#x27;d say the biggest perk would be the way it wraps around the ears without irritating them, as well the bigger design makes sure you have as undisrupted rest, if you have an exam the next day or just want a little extra rest on the weekend with minimal or no sensory input then give it a try...</li>
    <li> This is a sleep mask! Love it!</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised, good quality product. My husband stole it from me......won&#x27;t give it back!  That&#x27;s ok:  he sleeps better, snores less &#x3D; I sleep better.  Win-Win.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s snoring was unbearable. After trying just about everything else, I ordered the Sleep Mask. The results were immediate and amazing. All I can say is it works! Well worth the small investment.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to help prevent my night time dry eyes, after PRK eye surgery. It works well to help keep my eyes comfortable. The only downside is that it covers the ears, and when new, is a bit stiff and (rub your hand over your ear), you will hear noise from the movement of your head as the fabric moves over your ears. Good product though. I mostly sleep better when I wear this. I read another review where the person mentioned that they sometimes woke up with this off of their head and on the floor or something. That has happened to me a few times, what happens while asleep is a mystery. Good product, you might have to get used to it a little though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ken</li>
    <li> This good looking mask with Velcro fasteners is comfortable enough and yet in order to keep any trace of light out you will have to wrap it around your head tight.  If it were a little wider it might actually keep all light out of your eyes so essential for the Pineal Gland.  I believe that for a small person with a little head this mask may fit much better, perhaps perfect..</li>
    <li> The Sleep Master mask is everything that was promised. I especially like the smart reinforcing in some places- like extra tight sewing around the nose. High quality velcro seems built to last ( I&#x27;ve had problems with this in other masks ) and the width of all parts really maximizes the masks ability to block out light. I can&#x27;t say enough about this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have issues with me eyes from sleeping with a fan for many years and my doctor told me to get a good sleep mask and use eye drops at night.  It has made such a difference!  My eyes are much better and I can sleep through anything and even take a nap during the day.  It&#x27;s comfortable and doesn&#x27;t let air or light get to your eyes.  I left it at a hotel recently and just bought 2 of them in case I happen to lose it again.  Being without it for a few nights was awful!  This mask is great!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been sleeping with mine for about 2 years as I ordered that long ago from the maker.  Really comfortable.  Absolutely essential for trial as it also covers your ears.  I remove the inner pad when I hand wash the mask.  Dries in a few hours.  Great for sleeping on flights.  You can also hide some cash in this mask.  I will buy another when the time comes to do so.  Have bought many masks over the decades.  This is the most comfortable and most useful.</li>
    <li> This mask works as advertised: it block out light, stays on my face, and is very comfortable. The only down side that I could anticipate would be that it could be hot during the summer. We&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best sleep mask I have ever used. It blocks out sound which in my house was an added plus, I just may have to order another one in case anything ever happens to this one.</li>
    <li> got frays on it, and made face itchy felt like hair or something but no it was the product.</li>
    <li> The best  I&#x27;ve tried , very nice.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviews that this mask is too hot to wear in the summer months. After the first washing, little fibers from the outer satin material started to poke out from the mask. This made the mask irritating and itchy near my nose. I have a very cheap fleece mask that works much better.</li>
    <li> I suffer from a severe sleep disorder and require a sleep mask each day/night I manage to sleep. I burn through them rather fast, and prefer to replace them rather than try to clean them, since I never get it right, and I don&#x27;t like the detergent smell on the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask is almost the same price as the mask I like most (the brookstone foam eye mask), but I was interested in the smoother fabric rather than the plush fabric of the brookstone mask. In that sense, this mask is pretty good. The material used is good and quite comfortable. It&#x27;s cool and nonabrasive. They did not spare materials either. It is a solid mask all the way around, which will in fact make the mask easier to wear since you won&#x27;t feel the pressure of a thin band around your ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downsides, though, are that (1) the mask has no contour around the eyes, and (2) it does not completely block out the light. If you cannot stand feeling fabric pressed against your eyes, then this mask is definitely not for you. Likewise, if you want virtually all light blocked, so that you cannot tell if it is day or night, then you should look for a different mask. This mask does a decent job at blocking out the light, but it still leaves a small band of light along the bottom of the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An advantage I think this mask will have over the contoured masks is that those thick foam masks are ill-suited for stomach sleepers. It also does not conduct as much heat. So you won&#x27;t as likely suffer from sweat on warm nights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if you don&#x27;t mind the flat surface on your eyes, and you don&#x27;t need to block out virtually all traces of light, then this mask is a pretty good choice. But if those are concerns, this mask, while decent, is not going to be worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I recommend to people who suffer from a very bad sleep disorder to also pick up a pair of sleep phones. This is a head band with thin speakers embedded inside it. You connect that to your iPod. Create a playlist of nature sounds, binaural tracks, sleep hypnoses, etc. Then wear an eye mask over the top of the sleep phones. This will block out light and disruptive sounds, basically decoupling you from the world.</li>
    <li> My husband works in Europe and is constantly plagued with jetlag, etc and has to sleep during the day.  I originally got this mask for him to help nap during the day, but after trying it out myself I have taken it over!  It has changed my life.... i sleep like a rock.  It is so soft and comfortable.....plus i LOVE the color.  So now i MUST order another one to give back to him.... He loves it as much as I do!</li>
    <li> I thought I would like this sleep mask, unfortunately I didn&#x27;t. Every night I wear it I wake up with my whole head soaked in sweat because it&#x27;s too hot. I hear my pulse when the mask is pushed against my ears, and it drives me crazy. Not the mask for me.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd one we have bought. Family and friends really love how comfortable the mask is and how it works well keeping light out.</li>
    <li> I have tried several masks and I really like the wide Velcro clasp - much more comfortable than elastic bands.  You can angle the mask up if you like to sleep on your back or place it straight across if you want to block sounds.  It is well made, blocks light, fits well and I found the satin to feel nice and cool against my face.  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> Works great, feels good, totally blocks out all light, but seem to wake up with it having slipped off my head more often than not, other than that perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve blown through a bunch of eye masks over the years. Most have the same problem, the straps get stretched out and the mask doesn&#x27;t fit tightly enough to seal out light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the Sleep Master mask is unique, it just didn&#x27;t work for me. If light elimination were the only criteria, then this mask nails it. It blocks every bit of light even in the brightest environments but this comes at a price: comfort. There&#x27;s no nice way to say it, this is the most claustrophobic, uncomfortable mask I&#x27;ve every worn. It feels like my head has been bandaged up using bungee straps. It&#x27;s huge, it&#x27;s heavy, and it needs to be very tight in order to stay on for any length of time. One of two things happened when I wore this mask, I either threw it off in the middle of the night or it kept me from falling asleep until I put my old, tattered mask on in it&#x27;s place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t to say it&#x27;s not a well-manufactured mask, because nothing could be further from the truth. Unfortunately it just doesn&#x27;t compare to the lighter, more comfortable mask designs in my opinion.</li>
    <li> A lot of room for improvement</li>
    <li> This has to be one of the most comfortable sleep-gear accessories I have ever had the pleasure of wearing.  Easily adjustable, good padding, sleep experience is absolutely lightless.&lt;br /&gt;Even came with a free set of ear plugs.</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES this sleeping mask. He has repeatedly told me how much he LOVES this mask. He has trouble sleeping thru the night on an occasion and this sleep aid has cure that problem immensely. He sleeps with this mask nightly. This mask is the BEST of all sleep mask on the market. Will purchase again and again.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask rocks. It easily turns day into night and it&#x27;s so comfortable I look forward to wearing it. I haven&#x27;t given it 5 stars just because the claim of blocking out noise is false advertisement. But as purely as a sleep mask it is terrific.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied. My Sleep Master arrived much quicker than I expected. And the mask is so comfortable that wearing it is a pleasure. It is by far, the best sleep mask I&#x27;ve ever had, and I&#x27;ve tried several others before finding Sleep Master. I would recommend it to anyone.  It&#x27;s incredibly comfortable. I never before looked forward to wearing a sleep mask. Now I hate to have to take it off</li>
    <li> The proportions are a little off for me and my wife   but I still use it occasionally if I can&#x27;t find my other mask.  I personally prefer the dream zone mask. (also sold here)  I bought both at the same time and liked that one better.  Just my two bits.  Oh and I&#x27;m 5&#x27; 9\\&quot; my wifes 5&#x27; 4\\&quot; we&#x27;re pretty slim people  I have a slightly larger than avg nose, but my wife&#x27;s is small.  Hope that helps</li>
    <li> I have worked shift work my entire working life, sleeping half the time at night, half the time in the daytime.&lt;br /&gt;And the key to sleeping in the daytime. Quiet. Cool. Dark.&lt;br /&gt;Especially dark.&lt;br /&gt;At night I can go to sleep with all the lights on but in the daytime I need total darkness and the only way to get that is a sleep mask.&lt;br /&gt;So over the years I have tried many,many, looking for the perfect one.&lt;br /&gt;This is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very big, going way up my forehead, which serves no purpose. Light leaks in at the bottom of a mask, around your nose and cheeks, not at the flat top of your forehead. So this is pointless.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom part, around the nose and cheeks, is thin and does not lie flat. Is it just my big nose, or is the cut out just too small? I rather like the wide ...very wide band. It does not move at your roll over and such but is wider..and hotter..than needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most annoying perhaps is the fact that this mask is totally flat and if you have it tight enough to try and keep out light and will be tight to your eyes and very uncomfortable. there must be room for your eyes to blink without hitting the mask and this one fails totally on that.&lt;br /&gt;And did I mention it is very expensive. $$$ for a piece of silky material, a little padding and a piece of velcro?&lt;br /&gt;The claims to somehow muffle sounds is just not at all true. Believe me, I tested it. Sure, put in the pair of included ear plugs and that will work, but that is not that they claim. Ear plugs, which I can not wear, work with any eye shade. Nothig special about the ability of this one, super-wide band or not.</li>
    <li> I used the Sleep Master all the time. Now I need another &#x27;cause my wife is sleeping with my Sleep Master. Recommended.</li>
    <li> This is by far one of theeeee BEST tools on the market to help you sleep.  I received my comfy eye mask in a timely manner and have had many great nights of sleep since getting it.  I&#x27;m planning on getting these for my friends and family for Christmas.  Thank you for creating and promoting SUCH a great product! Well-worth the money.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed since it was not what I expected. For the price I was expecting something better, more cushioned on the ear area, to muffle sound better. Maybe some rubber or earplug material inside that area. The colored earplug seemed like a joke, they are exactly what I do not want to use and were not mentioned on the advertisement! I feel like I bought an almost simple mask with earplugs for $20 something, when I can have them for less than $5!!!  Definetely I always have received better items from Amazon, shame on you!!!</li>
    <li> Two of us in my family tried it with the same result. The smooth fabric (which feels comfortable) causes it to slip with every shift of the head.  Tightening it enough to cut down on the shifting, causes eye discomfort.</li>
    <li> If I could give this product 10 stars, I would!  This vendor provides outstanding customer service. Immediate shipment.    After I bought a SLEEP MASTER mask for myself, I was so impressed with the sleep mask, I bought a second one for my husband.     The mask is very comfortable.  You can adjust the mask to get a perfect fit.  Mask also totally blocks out light for day time sleeping.    Highly recommend this product.  Best money that I ever spent!</li>
    <li> I have tried many differant mask to sleep in and this one if very comfortable and fits nice and works great</li>
    <li> Would not stay in position and would fall off.  The mask put to much pressure on my eyes causing it to be uncomfortable</li>
    <li> Gets too damn hot at night that you have to take it off. You can still see from the nose cut so it is never dark enough. Waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;The silk is nice and soft tho.</li>
    <li> id say that over all this is a good product. It keeps the lights out and some sound. what could be different is the area around the eyes are not raised so it presses against them slightly but not to bad. Also its light but can become slightly warm throughout the night.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for a few weeks and am generally satisfied and can recommend this sleep mask having used a few. Here are the pros and cons as I see them -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Keeps 99% of light out -  even in a bright room&lt;br /&gt;* Feels comfortable on the face; Haven&#x27;t had any problems with hurting ears or mold allergy as other reviewers reported&lt;br /&gt;* Does help muffle external sounds, but doesn&#x27;t not completely eliminate ambiant noises&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* There is that nagging 1% of light that sneaks in from around the nose; unless you have your eyes open though I don&#x27;t see how you&#x27;d know it was there - I only did for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;* The mask is adjustable, but does need to be firm against the face to keep out the light - when tight it can press uncomfortably against the eyes; might be better if the area around the eyes were recessed somewhat to provide some clearance; it hasn&#x27;t caused me to stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;* This mask is huge! Prepare to be soundly laughed at by spouses, friends, etc. Even on a man&#x27;s face it&#x27;s quite large. Reminds me of my Floridian grandparents \\&quot;old people shades\\&quot;. Still I don&#x27;t mind sacrificing fashion for a good sleep - which is what I&#x27;m getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence I&#x27;d go for it. I haven&#x27;t regretted my purchase at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few of these on Amazon and this is by far the best one. The most compfortable and effective. Other sleep masks move and scratch your eyes, don&#x27;t block all the light, and keep you up at night. From the first time I put it on I love it. Feels great on my face and muffles out noise. As advertised and if you&#x27;re going to buy a sleep mask try this one first. You won&#x27;t need another promise.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a terrible sleeper.  I wake to a lot - light, noise, ghosts, whatever.  I also struggle to fall asleep.  Light, in particular, is a problem for me.  This mask is the best I&#x27;ve found.  It fits on my gargantuan head, covers my ears, and blocks out the light - even if it were daylight.  It&#x27;s soft and comfortable.  I&#x27;ve used it with great success on transAtlantic flights - it stays in place.  As noted by some - it can get a little warm if you&#x27;re a hot sleeper, because it is thick.  But, I&#x27;ve found that I adjusted to that pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a light blocking sleep mask - this is by far the best one I have ever found.</li>
    <li> Works well and is pretty comfy. Blocks out all light.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase from sleep master. I bought one to give it to a friend as a gift. I&#x27;m very pleased with the comfort and quality of the mask. It blocks all the light and keeps my earplugs in place.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Great mask. It&#x27;s a perfect complement to winding down at night. Effectively blocks out all light and is super soft over the eyes. Does nothing for noise but buy it if you feel like having something satin like over your eyes, plush like a cloud and want to block light.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> my Husband LOVES this. I stay up on my computer in bed, while he wants to go to sleep. I bought him this and he LOVES it. Soft and comfortable and keeps the light out. He is a larger man and this covers his face no problem.</li>
    <li> This SLEEP MASTER sleep mask is literally the most comfortable, light eliminating and sound eliminating sleep mask I have ever worn or seen!  It is light weight and actually conducive to falling asleep easily.  It arrived promptly and in excellent condition.  I would recommend it to anyone seeking a sleep mask. It is quite easy to put on and easily adjustable.  I am absolutely delighted with it!!!  My grandson (9 years old) recommended it to me, as did his parents, and once I tried it I could see why they were all so enthusiastic about it.  It&#x27;s softness, elimination of any light or distractions, and it&#x27;s comfortable cushioning of your entire head makes falling asleep both a pleasure and a certainty.  WE all just love it!!</li>
    <li> I like the comfort of this mask and the deep nose cutout that does not allow light in.  I also like the satin fabric and find the \\&quot;noise canceling\\&quot; qualities nice. It looks like it would be heavy but it&#x27;s very light weight. It cuts out just enough ambient noise but not too much where I can hear myself breathing like wearing earplugs does, which bothers me.  However, on the negative side I find the padding makes my head hot and sweaty.  Also, a few years ago I had Lasik eye surgery and while I&#x27;ve used other, smaller profile lightweight masks without problems, I find I wake up with scratchy/blurry vision that lasts a few hours with this mask.  I do not wear the mask too tightly and do not feel like it&#x27;s pressing on my eyelids at all so I&#x27;m not sure what is causing the problem.  Back to the dollar store mask for me!</li>
    <li> I am in the military and currently serving in Iraq. I work the nightshift, so i sleep during the day. It&#x27;s very hard to get good sleep especially when you have a roommate. One of my battle buddies had recently boughten this mask and said it works great. So i thought i&#x27;d give it a try. Once my mask came in and i used it for the first time, I passed right out. It muffled the sound immensley. I love this mask, and I am so glad i bought it!</li>
    <li> My daughter the night nurse finds this perfect.  So glad I purchased it.  Worth it.</li>
    <li> Very soft and comfortable. Works wonderfully to keep light out. Extremely pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> For the first month, I loved this sleep mask. Maybe you will still love it, but I&#x27;ve gone back to my original eye mask. After a month of use, I found it either too tight or too loose, and re-adjusting the velcro in the night woke my wife up. The worst experience was when it was too tight - pressing on my eyes all night gave me an enormous stye (a spot) under my eyelid the next day! Also the wrap-around sleep mask gets sweaty so you have to wash it, which will limit its lifespan.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product. The fabric is beautiful with the right type and amount of padding. It feels gentle on the face while providing effective yet comfortable covering. I am highly sensitive, yet this sleep mask is soothing. The ear coverage is a plus for comfort and masks some sound too. I&#x27;m not a back sleeper and need a product that works while sleeping on one&#x27;s side or belly or even tossing and turning. This one works. So glad I have it. Purchase experience was excellent.</li>
    <li> I am a Registered Nurse that works night shift and so I really need to get a good \\&quot;day&#x27;s\\&quot; sleep/rest.  Research shows that working night shift disrupts your circadian rhythms and you are at an increased risk for breast cancer.  How can we combat this?  By increasing our melatonin levels during the day by shutting out light.  Our body naturally releases melatonin during the dark/night hours.  I have found this mask to be soft, comfortable and capable of shutting out light, therefore promoting sleep.  I have worn other masks that are uncomfortable and you \\&quot;know\\&quot; you are wearing a mask...you just feel it.  This mask is soft and comfortable..so you can just drift off...  I recommend it!  Sweet dreams!</li>
    <li> I had serious problems sleeping after having work hours changed after 7 years on days, to midnights. This item did the trick. Comfortable? Heck yes. Spend a little extra on this item for the bliss it will bring. It is the best item I&#x27;ve ever purchased on Amazon.</li>
    <li> It may work for some people, but not for me.  It&#x27;s too big and bulky.  It doesn&#x27;t stay in place.  It puts too much pressure on your eyeballs.  The Daydream Basic Sleep Mask with Cool Pack worked for me.</li>
    <li> Comfortable but I find the fabric dries my eyes out. I had to line the eye area with a different fabric so I did not wake up with dry eyes. I also found the nose slit to be to narrow at the top to fit around my nose (I don&#x27;t have a wide nose) this keeps the mask from blocking all the light. Overall however it is the best mask I have found yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few sleep masks now and this is by far the best.  It blocks out the most light, fits the best (doesn&#x27;t put pressure on your eyes, fits wonderfully around the nose and stays put throughout the night) and has the added benefit of lessening sound on its own, with earplugs (which are included) welcome to sleep heaven!  One reason I use this sleep mask is to keep my eyes shut while I sleep.  I haven&#x27;t read a lot about this in reviews of masks but for whatever reason, sometimes when I sleep, I guess my eye isn&#x27;t fully shut and I wake to a very painful sensation - something like having sand in your eye.  This mask is a great solution to that if you are a fellow sufferer.  None of the ointments worked for me but this mask does the trick.  Thanks for the many restful nights Sleep Master!  A brilliant product.</li>
    <li> This is the most comfortable and the most effective sleeping mask I&#x27;ve ever used. It keeps the light out completely, which helps for daytime naps. I use it in the evening because I sleep with a fan on for noise control. Unfortunately, the air in the bedroom dries out my eyes, which is quite painful. This mask helps me so much with that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this mask. If you&#x27;re wondering if it is worth the price...it truly is, and it would make a great stocking stuffer.</li>
    <li> I alsolutely LOVE this sleep mask.  I have tried many different brands and styles over the years, and this one works better than any of the others by far.  It is so soft and comfortable, I bought another just to keep as a back up, although the original one I purchased is still as nice as when first started wearing it!  This one blocks light so well I don&#x27;t think I could ever sleep well without it.</li>
    <li> Before I purchased this mask I browsed and browsed various sites to find the mask that suit my needs and looks good. At first glance this mask didn&#x27;t really stand out until I read the reviews. For the most part I&#x27;ve read a ton of positive reviews and a few unhappy reviews as well. I decided to buy the mask and I must say I really enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a round face so not all masks fit me well but this mask is so soft that it kind of hugs my face. It blocks out the light almost completely. It also looks really good and blue is my favorite color so that&#x27;s awesome :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have a few gripes about it and that is in the summer the thickness can be a bit much if you happen to sleep during the day like I do. If the temperature gets above 60 degrees then there might be a little sweating involved once you put this mask on. It&#x27;s not much, but it is enough to make me rub my eyes in my sleep a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that one negative I have nothing but positive things to say about this mask. It&#x27;s great for the price, looks great, feels great and most importantly, covers your eyes completely and blocks almost ALL light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I go through a lot of different sleep masks and this has been one of my favorites. Its comfortable and well made. It blocks out all light and fits well especially around the nose area.  Most sleep masks screw that part up. It muffled sound a little, not a lot,but nothing but ear plugs or headphones really do that..trust me</li>
    <li> ...I really did. My fiance bought it for me b/c it gets such high reviews. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months and over the last month, I&#x27;ve worn a cheap airplane sleep mask under it to try to help. Here are the problems I notice:    - There are plastic panels sewn inside the mask (where each eye socket is). I think these are what are supposed to actually blocks the light, but since the panels are much smaller than the mask itself, they slide around. Mine are closer to the ears than the eye socket and there is no way to slide them back into place without opening than ripping the mask open and readjusting, then sewing it back into place.. So the mask doesn&#x27;t block much light after the first few times of wearing it.    - The mask lets in light from where it connects to the nose.    - To keep it on, I have to have the velcro so tight that when sleeping on my side, I end up with pain on the ear that is on the pillow.    - The silky material is stained from the moisture from my eyes (and even though I wash it, the stain does not go away).    That&#x27;s it! On to search for a new mask.</li>
    <li> Best sleep mask ever!!!</li>
    <li> Customer service is just as important to me as a wonderful product, &amp; Sleep Master is exceptional for both.&lt;br /&gt;They were very quick to respond to a query, &amp; provided a personal &amp; thoughtful response. I appreciated that.&lt;br /&gt;There are many things to love about this sleep mask - it&#x27;s very comfortable once you get used to having something this big wrapped around your head &amp; once you get the hang of the velcro closure. It&#x27;s soft &amp; smooth against the face &amp; head, blocks out light well, &amp; gives you that cocooned sensation that is so helpful if you fly a lot or if you get migraines. It washes well &amp; dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;The only nit I&#x27;d pick is the synthetic fabric. I hope one day they find a real silk fabric that works with the design &amp; then I&#x27;d be in total heaven.</li>
    <li> For some of us, this product stains your bed linens permanently. Yes, manufacturers, regardless of what you claim, it does happen. After all this time and complaining, I just can&#x27;t stop wondering why sleep mask manufacturers simply won&#x27;t make a plain white version with no color dyes in the material. Get it, sleep mask makers? Do ya get it yet? Duh! Maybe I need to start making white masks to corner the market on the world&#x27;s only true non-staining sleep mask. H-m-m-m. That&#x27;d show &#x27;em.</li>
    <li> I have tried other sleeping mask, and I think this one is great.  It eliminates the light and is very soft and comfortable.  I like it alot!!</li>
    <li> Still uncomfortable to wear. However, the texture  of the fabric is acceptable. Seems to slip often when adjusting your head while in bed. Tightening  it just makes it more uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used sleep masks for many years, being someone who cannot sleep when there is any intrusion of light.  Many sleep masks allow some slivers of light to creep in around the edges, especially when they are no longer brand new and have become more misshapen.      THIS MASK is designed the way ALL MASKS should be -- it covers a very wide area and protects completely from light leaks.  It is also incredibly soft and because it wraps completely around the head, it doesn&#x27;t shift around or feel uncomfortable.  It&#x27;s broad enough around the sides to even cover the ears to some degree, which helps with noise protection.      THEY SHOULD ALL BE DESIGNED THIS WAY.  I wish I had found this mask 20 years ago!!</li>
    <li> I have suffered from insomnia for many years.  This mask is like a gift from up above! Until purchasing this mask I had not had a complete night&#x27;s sleep in over twenty years.  Over the years I have tried just about everything available, including many different brands of masks.  Nothing worked until purchasing this mask.  It is comfortable, doesn&#x27;t move around and allows absolutely no light to enter from around the edges.  This simple little item has literally changed my life.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a daysleeper. I&#x27;ve tried other sleep masks, and they were either cheaply made, ineffective, or darned uncomfortable. This Sleep Master sleep mask is the best by a country mile! Comfortable, effective, and well made to last. I highly recommend it!    P.S. My husband, who worked night shift for many years and who was skeptical that any sleep mask could be as good as I claimed, tried my mask yesterday.  That convinced him that I was in no way exaggerating. Hurrah! I have ordered another Sleep Master and look forward to receiving it so we both can get the rest we need. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I do night shifts every other month and having a good sleep mask for day sleeping is a must for me. It&#x27;s very comfortable and blocks pretty much 98% of all light in my opinion. The only light enters from the nose area, but once you close your eyes it&#x27;s not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fit around the nose: I have a normal size nose (similar to the woman on the picture) as in not wide or too narrow, and it does not bother me. Like I said, it doesn&#x27;t form a perfect seal and a little bit of light comes through. However, once you close your eyes you&#x27;ll be able to sleep comfortably even with the window curtains open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye pressure: People complaining about eye pressure need to lessen the straps a little. They aren&#x27;t convex or dome shaped, but IMO, if you loosen the straps you&#x27;ll find a comfortable fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality of material: Silk like material that is very soft on the skin. The strap fit well around my head and ears. It stays cool on my face all throughout the day. After several wash sessions (washing machine and dryer), little treads started poking out. They can be very annoying, as it tickles your face. You&#x27;ll need to cut them off. If I buy this mask again, I&#x27;ll probably hand wash and air dry to avoid this problem of threads coming loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this mask to anyone that is looking for a good sleeping mask.</li>
    <li> I have been a night nurse for more then 20 years. This is the very best sleep mask I have found, it is very comfortable and great at blocking out the light. Barbara Ann</li>
    <li> Makes for a great nights sleep!  It is cool, comfortable, and really blocks the light and is the perfect amount of noise reduction!  I haven&#x27;t slept this well in 5 years!</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and made with quality. Keeps cool and comes off and on very easily.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Totally blocks light and promotes better sleep. Fabric feels soft and cool to the skin. Thank you !</li>
    <li> This is the best sleep mask I have found yet!  I frequently travel on transatlantic flights, stay in hotels, and end up sleeping odd hours.  Other sleep masks have been uncomfortable  (I.e., twist in my hair, don&#x27;t cover the eyese well, loosen as I sleep, are too tight creating a headache).  This mask fits nicely over my face, nose, and ears.  I can easily wear air pressure ear plugs that will stay in place on long flights.  I wake up even with the slightest amount of light from say a lighted clock next to the bed, so believe me that this mask does the trick for me.  I like the soft, satin fabric.  And, the adjustable Velcro is perfect as I have a small head which adds an additional layer of \\&quot;issues\\&quot; that I have to consider.  In all, I would recommend this product !</li>
    <li> A good sleeping mask, slightly padded, adjustable velcro.  Good accessory for any night shift worker.  Only a few problems with it, because it&#x27;s padded, it might be uncomfortable when it&#x27;s warm, sweating problems. The other problem is REM eye movements, because the mask is so close to your face, I have woken up not being able to blink. I have bought another cheaper mask that actually has the eye socket indentations which is more comfortable.  I use both eye masks, because I have different needs everyday.</li>
    <li> I wanted to purchase the BEST sleep mask for my wife on our anniversary. I started by searching for: \\&quot;the very best sleep mask\\&quot;. Sleepmaster immediately came up. I disregarded this and searched for 2 more hours...looking at reviews and considering the company and quality. Well, I decided on the Sleepmaster sleep mask anyway. Marc Gordon at the company provided outstanding service...advising me and taking on my order as if I was a personal friend. He REALLY cared what I thought! This product is outstanding but the company&#x27;s customer service is off the chart!!!!! It is refreshing to do business with a company who really cares about the customer! Thank you Sleepmaster! Thank you Marc! I will recommend this product and this company to my friends and relatives...and i have a bunch of them!  Lynn Underwood</li>
    <li> I love this sleep mask!  It is the first sleep mask I&#x27;ve been able to use that did not hurt my ears, plus it is such a pretty color. The material used is so soft and silky against my skin, and the mask is very well constructed. You won&#x27;t go wrong ordering this product!  UPDATE:  I have used this sleep mask nightly for over a year now, and wanted to update my review.  This mask has stood the test of time.  I have thrown it into suitcases, washed it numerous times in lavatories, hung it from shower rods to dry, rolled  around on pillows, and this mask has remained perfect!  It still looks new and feels new.  No loose threads, no change in the comfortable fit, no negatives at all!    If I could give it more stars, I would!</li>
    <li> If your looking for a sleep mask that is comfortable, this is the one.  It also is wash machine safe on delicate cycle; but hang it on a line to air dry.</li>
    <li> Very nice feel on the face but still slid off my head during sleep.  That could be mostly my fault however.</li>
    <li> This product is really well done and has a super soft fabric, but unfortunately did not work well for me as I expected. I&#x27;m guessing this is a personal thing, not the product&#x27;s fault - it does not stay put on my face all night and maybe that&#x27;s because I turn a lot while sleeping. I tried to make it fit tighter but then it got too uncomfortable. I think it might work for you, at least it&#x27;s worth trying since this was the only mask I had (and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few...) that completely blocks any light. BTW, delivery was great - fast and product came in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> This product very effectively blocks light and mutes sound.  The velcro straps allow for quick and comfortable adjustment.  Much better system than my other sleep mask that has thin, hard-to-adjust straps.  However, I am still adjusting to this sleep mask because of its bulk around my ears.  Despite its thickness, it does breathe well.  Some may prefer a lighter mask that just covers the eyes.  But if background noise is also an issue, this may the perfect mask for you.</li>
    <li> This is the second mask I have bought for my husband, he left the first at a hotel. Best product on the market, very comfortable, no light gets through and blocks sound too!!</li>
    <li> If you are only interested in this item because it combines noise reduction with light reduction don&#x27;t bother.  The noise reduction offered is hardely noticable.  The ears have the same amount of padding as the entire unit does.  You have to keep taking it off and on and concentrate to notice any sound difference.  The package itself includes ear plugs.  There is not even enough noise reduction to quite someone lightly breathing next to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item does block out a lot if not all light.  It is comfortable (the material is slick).  It does seem durable.  The closure is in the back and is velcro.  It is slightly uncomfortable to lay on the velcro portion.  There is no stretch or give to this mask so I find it more comfortable to have it slightly loose (too tight and your ears will feel like you&#x27;ve been wearing headphones for a while and your nose will feel restricted).  I thought it would be warm but the material is breathable enough I&#x27;ve not noticed much temperature difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I would have bought this item if I had one to sample first.  For the price and claims I was expecting better noise reduction.  Not enough to block out snoring but at least enough to block out a fan or light breathing.  I am keeping it as it is comfortable, blocks out lots of light, and my partner snores enough that I usually have earplugs in anyway.</li>
    <li> This mask is just what I need to give me the best chance to sleep through the night. Well thought out and built for comfort. The simple velcro adjustment is convenient and stays put. I dialed it in the first night, and haven&#x27;t had to readjust it since...just slip it on and relax. Works fine over in-ear head phones too. All surfaces are soft and breathable providing comfort in all of my tosses and turns.&lt;br /&gt;Well done!</li>
    <li> I have no idea how others could like it. The smell of chemicals is so strong that I couldn&#x27;t bear with it after 10 min. This is clearly a problem of the heavily chemical laden manufacturing process. The label says it is made in the US, but it makes me wonder. Certainly it looks and smells like Chinese made. In that case, this item probably would cost under $1 to manufacture and should have a retail price around $5.  And if you ask me, I know what I&#x27;m talking about and I know how sub-substandard and polluted the Chinese manufacturing process is. It isn&#x27;t a matter of Chinese&#x27;s manufacturing ABILITY (you know they could put a man in space and make high-speed bullet trains that US currently can&#x27;t); it&#x27;s all about the standard, awareness and concept.    But made in the US? Can you prove it? I would expect something better if it is made in the US. Did they even check the manufacturing process? How about a smell test first? Do they realize this is put over one&#x27;s nose? Heavily chemical laden. If I try to like it, my nose can&#x27;t.    Other things about this product are okay. Not outstanding, but okay. Wearing is reasonably comfortable, although not superb. Light-blocking is fairly effective. It leaks light from the opening above the nose, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting total darkness. The material is reasonably soft, but don&#x27;t expect natural silky feeling. It is just artificial material that has a reasonable quality. I don&#x27;t like its color, but that&#x27;s subjective, and I don&#x27;t rate it low for that reason.    And finally, I expect that some will hate this review. But please, if you don&#x27;t smell, don&#x27;t fault others because they can (unless your job is to watch out for this product here).  I don&#x27;t tend to write harsh reviews. Just look at the other reviews I wrote.</li>
    <li> This is the worst sleep mask I&#x27;ve ever had.  in warm weather it makes my face sweat.  the velcro is noisy and gets caught in my hair, and the wide sides which are supposed to drown out sound only serve to make my hair extra flat on the sides--i have very curly hair and so when i wake up in the morning, i look like a fish from the front.  Really not that great and not worth the $25 and all the hype.  I&#x27;d have been better off with a $10 one from the drug store.</li>
    <li> My wife works evenings, so she needs to sleep during the daylight hours. This will surly help in her ability to sleep in the daytime. Prompt delivery, Thanks!</li>
    <li> I do like this sleepmask, however I don&#x27;t like the fact that there is a little room between the mask and nose for light to seep into the bottom of the mask. It is not perfect but I do like the fact that it is velcro to slip onto any head. It is a 4/5 on my score card.</li>
    <li> I have been using this sleep mask for some time now. Just bought two more!  I noticed a bad review about chemical odor and felt compelled to write.  I&#x27;ve used several over the years, recommended to friends and gave many as gifts. I have never experienced any odor and I have allergies and chemical sensitivities.  This mask is hypoallergenic and odor-free in my experience.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I&#x27;ve never been more in love with a sleeping mask, it&#x27;s truly amazing.</li>
    <li> This Sleep Master sleep mask is a little pricey, but very high quality and certainly does the job. It&#x27;s obviously built to last, so I expect to be able to use it a lot longer than the $5-10 variety of masks out there.</li>
    <li> I work nights and to to full time school only getting about 5 hours of sleep during the day and it has helped me get some more sleep than I would without it.  I have tried different masks but this  one works the best, I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Best eye shades ever! Blocks out nearly all light and fits well. Will order again when this one gets old and worn.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2NC49CHFQ2ARN]]Your product helped me sleep!  Everyday I struggle to get to sleep/stay asleep from beaming sunlight from my window shades.  It is very annoying.  As soon as I put on the sleep master, I fall back asleep within 2 mins!  Your product is very comfortable and helped me enjoy the little sleep I get in a night!  Thank you again.</li>
    <li> Great item! I like the fact that it covers your ears while you sleep. 1.- it is a natural fit so it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have a foreign object on your head &amp; 2. - it keeps your ears warm. bye bye sleep meds!</li>
    <li> It is not very comfotable.  The strapping is in the Center...thus applies pressure to your eyes..&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this one at all</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used sleep masks for many years, some good, some not so good, but this one is, without hesitation, the most poorly designed sleep mask I&#x27;ve ever had the misfortune to own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problems I&#x27;ve faced are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The rough side of the velcro that holds the mask closed faces your pillow, so if you do not have every last part of the velcro covered it will stick to your pillowcase if you lay on your back.  When you go to move it \\&quot;rips\\&quot; off the pillowcase it has become stuck to. This noise will probably wake you up; if it doesn&#x27;t the fact that the mask, which has become stuck to your pillowcase, twists on your head as you roll over and no longer keeps the light out as the nose cutout now resides on your temple will wake you up.  I would imagine that only those people with small heads can have the velcro completely covered, if your head is normal or on the larger size, you&#x27;ll have a significant amount of velcro showing and not only be awakened, but ruin your pillowcase, as this sleep mask has done mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Because of its design, in order to keep the mask on the entire night as you sleep, you have to velcro it pretty tight to your head. I&#x27;ve had several masks that are like that and usually it&#x27;s no big deal, but because of the poor design of this sleep mask, if I make it tight enough to not fall off or spin around my head it pushes against my eyes fairly hard and when I awake my vision is blurry for usually more than 30 minutes and my eyes hurt because of the pressure against them all night long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The assertion that the mask muffles noise is simply ridiculous.  Unless you strap the mask so tight to your head that your eyeballs are being shoved backwards into your brain, you will notice absolutely no sound reduction. Even when you have the mask as tight as it will go, it still does not reduce noise in the least.  This is a false assertion and was one of the main reasons I purchased this sleep mask, only to be very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Finally, the ridiculous assertion that this mask helps us \\&quot;ladies\\&quot; keep a lovely hairstyle as we sleep, is laughable. The direct quote from their website is this,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;And, for you ladies, we&#x27;ve all heard the saying &#x27;Nothing looks better on a woman than a good night&#x27;s sleep.&#x27; Sleep Master actually keeps your hairstyle in place during sleep!  Wake up, take off Sleep Master, and you are ready to go...No bedhead!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sleep Master&#x27;s assertion only holds true if flat on top, with a band of squished hair across the middle of your head, then flat at the bottom is a hairstyle which you covet. This sleep mask hardly helps you maintain your out-of-the-stylist&#x27;s-chair hair style while you doze, like it asserts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please give a great deal of thought before wasting your money on this sleep mask. My suggestion would be to stay with a more tried-and-true model, for this one is a complete fallacy from start to finish.ion that this mask helps us \\&quot;ladies\\&quot; keep a lovely hairstyle as we sleep, is laughable.

    <li> Really thick - didn&#x27;t find this one very comfortable.</li>
    <li> Worked so good I had to give it away to a friend who was visiting from Europe so she could use it on the plane back. Bought a new one for myself and I still love it.</li>
    <li> I love this mask, first full night of sleep I&#x27;ve had in quite some time. It is by far the best mask I have ever owned and well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love love love this sleeping mask, I would not trade it ever for a cheaper one, which I used to use before discover my sleep master eye mask  I would buy from this seller over and over again. This sleep mask is so comfortable lightweight, does not leave marks on your face, and you get what you pay for. I promise you will not be dissappointed</li>
    <li> Excellent, fast, hassle-free transaction. I bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister and she loves it (and she&#x27;s very picky!)  It&#x27;s comfortable and blocks out all light.  I&#x27;m buying another one for myself! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I am a very picky sleeper and I must say that I forgot I was wearing it.  I was very concerned when I ordered this if it would be comfortable.  I slept like a baby.  A must for traveling.</li>
    <li> I snore like a bear or freight train, or so my wife says.  She received the SLEEP MASTER and is so happy!!!She says its comfortable,soft and keeps the sound of my ZZZZZZZ&#x27;s to a bearable level.... and best of all she is SLEEPING IN MY BED with me AGAIN....&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Sleep Master I have my wife back....&lt;br /&gt;Rick M happiest guy in the world</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this mask based on the reviews.  I must have a small face because it did not fit as well as it looks in the product picture.  At some points I felt a bit claustrophobic.  I did not get any sound reduction.  We&#x27;ll see how night 2 goes.  I also think the price is especially high.  When I took it out of the package I felt like I could have made one that looked about the same.</li>
    <li> It presses against the eyes and eye lashes. The sound protection it says it offers is totally pointless. It kind of feels nice, thats it. Keeping in mind it is a very pricey eyemask, total rip of.</li>
    <li> Common eye block. It blocks sounds by a pair of earplugs. I can by earplugs by myself.</li>
    <li> It really if very comfortable and does cut out the light completely; muffles noise as well.</li>
    <li> Now i can sleep during the day ,, the sun does not bother me anymore,, its big, and you can easy breathe ,, best mask!!</li>
    <li> At first I loved this item. Then I washed it...and all went wrong. I followed the instructions, but it began to fall apart. While it was new it was great, but it didn&#x27;t last but a few months. Also, if you sweat at all uin your sleep this made that experince even more unpleasant. I can&#x27;t explain, but it doesn&#x27;t absorb anything, so it gets sticky and gross. Maybe I could have done something different, but I am happeir now with a different one.</li>
    <li> This thing is SO fantastic. Because of the Velcro strap it doesn&#x27;t stretch out. I was really wary on using the earplugs included since my ears usually hurt with such things, but they aren&#x27;t bad! I&#x27;ve developed a system where I rotate which ear gets a plug, then just lay on my side normally. Fantastic if you live near a noisy street, have barking dogs, or loud roommates. Awesome product!! A definite must have if you find yourself waking up at night and peeking at the clock over and over.</li>
    <li> What I didn&#x27;t realize when buying this was that it remains wide all the way around your head rather than narrowing at the ear and around the back.  I also expect the nose opening to be a &amp;#34;V&amp;#34; split rather than just a vertical cut.  The nose opening took a little getting used to, and I find it turns on my head more readily that other masks I&#x27;ve used.  The turning may be due to there being no elastic band to keep it tight, and the smooth material it is all made of readily sliding on your skin and hair allowing it to turn.  None of these are major complaints, just observations.  Blocks light well if positioned properly.  Blocks some sound too, and comes with additional ear plugs if you need/want them.  Perhaps the best thing (for me) is that it fits my giant head (7 3/4 hat size - XXXL helmet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one real complain would be that within a week the blue material began to discolor from oils from my skin and hair.  I generally shower in the evening before bed after I work out, so I&#x27;m not generally oily/greasy on my skin and hair that time of night.  Since I don&#x27;t wear it in public, I guess I don&#x27;t care that much, but it isn&#x27;t the best looking.  Were it black you&#x27;d never notice, so if the maker is reading this, switch colors!</li>
    <li> I am a day trader and play poker many nights.  My sleep schedule is varied.  This mask is the first one I can count on to help me sleep any time.  It&#x27;s comfortable, blocks out all light and some sound--The perfect combination to put me right out.</li>
    <li> my husband has to have a room darker than dark!  I like a room with the some moonlight coming in.  I bought this&lt;br /&gt;and at first he was not going to wear it. I moved into another bedroom and he decided to give the mask a try.  We are back in the same bedroom now and he loves the mask.  Men are so hard to figure out. Next I am going to scout out amazon for hearing aids!</li>
    <li> I travel quite a bit and sometimes it&#x27;s difficult to settle down enough to get a good night&#x27;s sleep. When I first heard of the Sleep Master I knew I had to try it. Well, I love it so much that I&#x27;ve purchased no fewer than half a dozen over the years for family and friends. In fact, I just purchased two more because I left mine in a hotel while I was travelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a Life Coach with a specialty in Health and Wellness ([...]) I also recommend the Sleep Master to clients who have trouble sleeping. It&#x27;s a great non-drug alternative for people suffering from insomnia. The cocoon the Sleep Master creates, by covering the eyes AND the ears, is absolutely delicious. And the fabric is so incredibly soft that it is a pleasure to sink into a good night&#x27;s sleep. Run, don&#x27;t walk, and get your own!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product. Works great.</li>
    <li> The sleep mask is far superior to any that I&#x27;ve used before. It&#x27;s making a big difference in my sleep quality. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t your normal mask, it&#x27;s much thicker so your face/eyes/nose gets hot.  Plus it does cover your ears so be prepared.    Otherwise it&#x27;s good. If you want to be shut off from the real world, this mask is for you.</li>
    <li> The mask is great and I love how it feels on my face. Not to mention that the seller put a hand written sleep well on my reciept. I thought that was really nice. I have to say that my sleep has gotten better since i wear the Sleep Master Sleep Mask to bed. I actually bought the mask to cover my eyes after eye surgery, for the two days i am not to open my eyes, that i will be having come the end of this month. But, i started to wear it to see how it would stay on my face and how well it really worked and i was surprised that i didnt wake up as much during the night to adjust positions in my sleep as i used to before i wore it to bed. I actually slept better.... it surprised me i really didnt think that masks could do that.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife who works at night and sleeps days. She says it works great at blocking the light and the weight of it is enough to keep her eyes closed while she sleeps, however we knew before buying it that it covers your ears but figured wed give it a try. After trying it, she doesnt like not being able to hear so she doesnt use it and has sense given it to me. Doesnt bother me tho and im getting great sleep all the time with it, great for naps during the day.</li>
    <li> I put this mask on my Wish List after reading all of the good reviews for it. Upon receiving it for my birthday, I was anxious to try it out. Turns out it is bulky, hot and uncomfortable to wear. It squeezes your head and pushes so hard on your eyes that it is painful to sleep in. There was practically no noise reduction either. I just don&#x27;t get all of the 5 star reviews.</li>
    <li> I have used sleep masks for years and really like this one.  It covers my eyes completely and does not let any light in.  I love the fact it covers your ears which helps keep some sound out.  It does tend to get a little hot as it does not seem to \\&quot;breathe\\&quot; as well as others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never found a sleep mask I could wear before this one. I was admitted to the hospital for a lengthy stay and had to figure out how to get some sleep. This mask was the answer to my prayers -- very comfortable on my eyes, didn&#x27;t pull my hair, muffled ambient sounds, and easy to find if I took it off during the night and wanted to put it back on in the early morning. It is just the right weight and fit. The earplugs that come with it are the most comfortable I&#x27;ve ever worn. I had a question for customer service and they were remarkably responsive. I recommend this mask highly!</li>
    <li> I bought this item to see if it would help with another problem.  I use a C-PAP machine for sleep apnea and the part that fits over my nose blows air into my left eye when I turn in my sleep.  I&#x27;d wake up with dry eye and have tried everything to correct the problem.  I thought this mask might work because it seemed substantial enough to block the flow of air.  I&#x27;m very happy with it, and my left eye thanks you for your mask.</li>
    <li> My wife is and early to bedder and I am a night owl.  Now we can both be happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this to my wife hoping that she&#x27;d use it and find peace while I stay up and read with the light on.  She claims that she&#x27;s having her most restful sleep ever, and I can turn on the lamp beside our bed without her noticing a thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wraps fully around her head and allows her to move in her sleep without moving on her head.  I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;ll ever sleep again without it.</li>
    <li> I bought these eye shades for my friend who sufferes with eye pain from RPM.  It has been helpful to shut out the light and reduces her pain.  It has been a blessing to her</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this Mask!! I work at night so I sleep during the day and I have 4 children. This mask not only blocks out the sunlight completely, but it reduces noise significantly. I am a light sleeper, but when I put this mask on, I fall right to sleep. It appears to be a little bulkly, but it is actually very comfortable -- not to mention adjustable.</li>
    <li> I have had mine for quite sometime and at first it took some time to get used to it. Mostly because I never had used a sleep mask on a regular basis. I got this because I am highly sensitive to sounds and light while sleeping and I would open my eyes at times when sleeping and it would wake me up. I read that sleep masks sometimes help with that so I got this one. I really like because it blocks out light when properly placed, can shift during sleep though.The velcro does keep it in place more then straps. The material is soft and I like how it is thick so it muffles noise. I am highly addicted to mine and have to use it every night. It has increased my sleep hours and I feel more rested which is what I had hoped for! The reason it&#x27;s not 5 stars is because you have to wash it frequently. Mine was giving me bad acne and needs to be washed at least once a week. It takes about 2 days for the washing and drying process which is a bummer too. I have considered buying another one for this purpose and to alternate. I am overall very happy with this sleep mask.</li>
    <li> Really good at keeping out the noise and light of Manhattan - this has massively improved the quality of my sleep and consequently my life.</li>
    <li> I prefer just your cheap standard sleep mask with the elastic string because this one Velcros on the back and when you try to lie down it digs into the back of your head. Can&#x27;t sleep with it on, which defeats the purpose.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to sleep with a mask with an elastic band.  This was my first Velcro purchase and I love this mask.</li>
    <li> I think my statement above says it all!  I would definitely recommend this product for anyone interested it making it stay dark longer.</li>
    <li> Soft. Dark. Smoothly comfortable.</li>
    <li> I got this expecting some great sleeping mask since i paid so much money for it. turns out, light shines in through the bottom, it rotates around my head when i move, and it moves down above my mouth. I woke up countless times having to adjust it and its very irritating on my sides.</li>
    <li> Worked great but slides off easy.</li>
    <li> This mask is very comfortable, does not push on your eyes and truly keeps all light out! Very soft satin. The only drawback I can say is sometimes it comes off my head when I&#x27;m sleeping/moving around. The velcro is nice and stays connected on the back of the head.</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s very lightweight but completely blocks the light. I wear it with a sleep apnea mask, and it has eliminated those ugly sleep marks on my face from the straps. Because this gently covers my ears, there&#x27;s no uncomfortable straps to struggle with at night. Best sleep mask that I&#x27;ve ever bought! I have severe dry eyes and found other masks gapped or pinched my ears, keeping me uncomfortable all night and with achy eyes in the morning. This mask solved all those issues. I love not have strap marks on my face in the morning. My eye drops and ointments have made it pretty icky, but I handwashed it and it&#x27;s fine. My only issue is the loop part of the velcro is too long and catches on my pillow, but with a seam ripper, that can be easily cut off and removed.</li>
    <li> I suffer from chronic insomnia...it&#x27;s so bad that there isn&#x27;t a single prescribed sleep medicine I&#x27;ve used that has helped me sleep. I have been forced to try everything I can to help induce sleep. Sleep masks, ear plugs, incense, tea, and sleep inducing music. The previous sleep masks I have used all have had elastic straps which quickly stretched and have become unusable. I was leery about the price of the Sleep Master mask, but went ahead and ordered it based on all the positive reviews. I am so glad that I did! This is by far the most comfortable mask I&#x27;ve ever had. It completely blocks out all light. It&#x27;s completely adjustable. The mask not only fits around my head, but also my extremely petite 9 year old&#x27;s tiny head. I love the fact that it covers my ears as well. Not only is it completely comfortable to my ears and helps with noise reduction, but during times I do use ear plugs, it keeps them in place (I have very small ear canals and the plugs always fall out while sleeping). I am so completely satisfied, and find that I do have an easier time getting that all elusive sleep. I highly recommend the Sleep Master Sleep Mask to anyone who struggles with sleep.</li>
    <li> The mask works as advertised. It is very comfortable and keeps out all light. I have been sleeping with the fans going because of the hot summer and this mask makes it a little difficult to hear my alarm when I have my ear plugs in and the mask in place. However my alarm clock is not all that loud to begin with so maybe a louder alarm clock is in order.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s comfortable and blocks light well, but tends to fall off as I move around in my sleep. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> It is OK.  I find it is hot especially for women who get flashes during the night.  I woke up and my hair was soaked.  I think I would prefer one not so bulky.  It does keep the light out !</li>
    <li> Love this mask it&#x27;s just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Sleep Master was recommended to me by a thoughtful friend.  This mask is wonderful, just what I was looking for,  It is soft, cool and comfortable and blocks all the light. Once I adjusted the fitting it now just slides on and off perfectly every time. Love it!</li>
    <li> I agree it shuts out light, and I agree it feels great on the face and that it isn&#x27;t a bother to fall asleep with. What really bums me out is that it doesn&#x27;t block out sound... or if it does it&#x27;s not something many would perceive. Furthermore, it always falls off during the night, and I&#x27;ve tried for about 2 weeks now at different levels of tightness to try to fix this issue.</li>
    <li> I read the other buyers comments and was confident that I was going to get a great product. Everyone seemed to really like it.  If you are a light sleeper, this is the product for you!  I hate waking up in the summer at 5:00 am. This mask is a life saver. I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I am finding this product.  I can&#x27;t wait to take this baby camping.</li>
    <li> Delivery came well before estimated date. The fit and comfort of the mask is top notch, Very pleased and I&#x27;ve been getting some very solid sleep in with working overnight shifts now!</li>
    <li> This product says what it does, is very comfortable, blocks out all light and is made from a material that doesn&#x27;t increase the temp around your eyes. I bought this for my wife that is very sensitive to light that prevents her from sleeping, seeing that she is a day sleeper. I&#x27;m so impressed that I intend to buy my own, in the near future. People looking at this, look no further... Awesome buy!!!!</li>
    <li> When I first got his mask I gave it 4 stars. But I&#x27;ve had it for months now and I don&#x27;t use it anymore. I am a bit of a sleep mask connoisseur. I work graveyard so I sleep during the day and must have absolute darkness. This mask does create absolute darkness. And the material is soft and smooth and it does stay in place. All good things. For me, however, I started going back to my old mask for the smaller size and the fact that&#x27;s it&#x27;s more lightweight. I. Cant say this mask is \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; but it just feels bulky to me. It&#x27;s more than double the size of my go-to mask and I was finding I kept waking. Up to adjust it and it took a lot of adjustment to get it to sit just right on my eyelids and bridge of nose to feel comfortable and cutout the light. For me, just too pricey for not being able to get the comfort as good as my cheaper lightweight absolute darkness mask.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t block out anything unless you live in a house with no pets, no kids, and no other family. I bought this because I work nights and I can&#x27;t wear earplugs anymore. I was looking for something to help buffer the noise in my house but I can hear everything as if there was nothing covering my ears. It blocks light well enough but that is it. I have a sleep mask I can use for that -- and it only costed me a dollar.</li>
    <li> You will love this super soft face mask that comes with ear plugs? This is the key to all of you guys who need a little more me time at night while your wife goes off to la-la land. Enjoy!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter is an RN working the night shift and absolutely loves these.  She has searched for several months and we are glad we found these.  Very comfy!</li>
    <li> It works very well for me. I work over night and go to bed around 9:00am. My most active time of the day is when there is no sunlight. So I actually love to have plenty of day lights in my house and in my room when I am home. I never had to close the blind and sheers when I go to bed, just put on this mask, It blocks the light very well and I am able to fall asleep immediately.</li>
    <li> I was concerned, after reading some of the other reviews, that this mask would be uncomfortable to wear but I find it comfortable. It also blocks out a lot more light than my previous sleep mask. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have the unfortunate requirement to work nights 1 month per quarter and have a hard time sleeplng no matter how dark I try and make my room.  I ordered this mask and after only one night of getting used to it I was sleeping much better. I am back on days now and am still wearing the mask, the only drawback is that I sleep so sound now that I keep waking up in a puddle of drool.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this sleep mask. It&#x27;s made of lovely &amp; elegant satin material in a peaceful teal blue. The amount of padding is just right, and the cut of the mask is so comfortable. There&#x27;s enough fabric to block out light from above the eyes and around the nose. The velcro is very well sewn at the back, so that you can wear the mask all night without it moving around. The padding makes it comfortable to lie on your side or on your back. This sleep mask is so luxurious that it would make a great gift for the person who has everything and only likes very fine merchandise. It&#x27;s a far cry from the cheesy, skimpy masks they give you on planes, or the scented masks they sell at natural foods stores.</li>
    <li> The Sleep Master definitely works! In the past two years or so, I started to have trouble falling asleep - call it hormones, stress, working out too late in the day, watching TV at night (which is definitely not recommended if you have trouble falling asleep). I¨d tried other sleep masks that were very soft and fluffy but they came off at night and slipped up or down the back of my head. When I came across the Sleep Master it seemed like the best one of the lot; the price was good too. Then they arrived fast, well packed and they fit perfectly. That night I put them on - they felt like a cloud. I fell asleep very quicky and the mask was still on in the morning. I couldn´t be happier. Thanks Sleep Master - You mastered my sleep problem.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using the bucky eye shades for over 10 years and can&#x27;t sleep without them, so i ordered this as a second mask to keep at my boyfriend&#x27;s house.  i was really excited when i came across this one; i liked the idea that it covered the ears, and the shape looked like it would be secure around the nose, which i was hoping would prevent some of the sliding that happens with the bucky mask while i sleep.  unfortunately, i woke up with sore eyelids after using the sleep master for one night- the bucky has a layer of foam padding around the periphery to keep the mask from touching your eyelids, where this one just lies flat.  i tried loosening it the next night but my eyes were still sore from the night before, and the only way to sleep comfortably with it on was to make it so loose that it constantly fell off.  this might not be a problem for someone with a more prominent brow bone, i suppose, but unfortunately i had to send it back.  luckily the company was a pleasure to deal with; they promptly issued a refund and even asked for feedback on why the mask didn&#x27;t work out. oh well- back to the old one...</li>
    <li> This is simply the best sleep mask you can buy.  No nagging band around the back of your head, or your ears.  This also completely covers your ears, minimizing outside sound.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Get this mask, it&#x27;s the only one you should consider.  This does not have any elastic band to wear out and will not get loose with use. It has Velcro in the back, and the whole thing is padded of the same thickness material and will not stretch out.  Works great.</li>
    <li> love the product.  much more comfortable than any other sleep mask i have used.  While you would think the silk and the shape of the design would cause it to slide off, I must say I have never lost it during the night.  It fits secure but not too snug, and it blocks out 99.99% of the light.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only mask that stays on me all night!  I have tried several other brands and this one stays put all night.  I get the best deep sleep never had before.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a Christmas gift and my daughter-in-law said she loves it. She said it is very comfortable and keeps the light out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a night shift nurse and sleep during the day and I&#x27;ve been using this mask for about a year now and I can not go with out it.  It is so soft and is very comfortable.  I have had no problem with the Velcro or it moving as I read with a few other reviews.  I have washed it several times and it still looks new.</li>
    <li> It was advertised as light blocking, sound muffling and of a breathable material. In actuality light does get in around the nose area. The supposed sound muffling was nonexistent. The material made my face hot. I also didn&#x27;t like that the mask lies flush against my eye lids and offers no clearance like some masks do. I&#x27;ll stick to my old mask which offers better performance for a lower price.</li>
    <li> My biggest complain is the seam on the bridge of the nose pinches, they could have used a U stitch verses the V. There is no consideration for the eye sockets either, too much padding over the eye socket putting pressure on your eyes if worn to tight. To be comfortable, you have to wear it so loose that the mask just slides off. Then becomes bunched up underneath you, making you uncomfortable and waking you up. If you sleep on your back the padding and velco are just too much to be comfortable. The cut is wrong for covering ears to help dampen sound as advertised buyer be ware, to compensate they include a set of foam earplugs (YUK!!!). For the ears they should have made flaps to extend over the ears with extra padding. All in all, I was completely mislead by the other consumer reviews, possibly written by agents of the manufacture. Do not waste the money, spend $5-$10 on something else. I am going to try the Dream Essentials Sweet Dreams Contoured Sleep Mask next since it has a full covered bridge on the nose and pockets for the eye sockets.</li>
    <li> in the beginning i was wondering which one i should take ??? then i saw this choice and decided to take it ,,actually after i tried it i found that it makes very comfortable feeling and looks nice  ,,,,  i love it</li>
    <li> I recently received your Sleep Master sleep mask as a Christmas gift for my   husband. He has had other sleep masks, but they weren&#x27;t built to stand up to   constant use and kept sliding off his face. He really likes this mask because   it&#x27;s well constructed, washable and covers both his eyes and ears. He also likes   the sound-deadening feature. This will help him reduce distractions that keep   him from getting a good night&#x27;s sleep. He is grateful for this early Christmas   gift, and so am I. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I put off buying this product because I thought it was too expensive. The day it arrived, I was so excited. It came nicely packed with a note on the care and maintenance along with a good pair of earplugs. What a thoughtful touch. I tried five other sleep masks and found they were too tight, too loose and bulky; they were off halfway through the night and a few other issues. Now that I own the Sleep Master, I can see and feel the difference. This is a well designed, quality product. I like the way it wraps around my head and ears. I have worn earplugs for years but I need complete darkness to go with them now. I washed it over the weekend and really missed it while it was drip-drying. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Soft, beautiful, wearable, this is this best eye mask I&#x27;ve ever had!! It perfectly and softly closes out light, still allowing you to breathe.  It also makes sound less of an issue, even including ear plugs.  My husband asked for his own (he never asks for anything) left it on a plane, and then asked for a SECOND one. That really tells you something!!  It closes behind your head with the use of velcro, so it fits almost any head size perfectly.  I will be buying these again and again. I had no idea eye masks could be like this!</li>
    <li> For several years, I have happily used and gifted Sleep Master eye masks.&lt;br /&gt;I’ve tried several and without doubt, they are not only the most comfortable (the silk feels great) and effective (they truly block the light), they are durable, still good after a few years of regular use and many washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I go to sleep earlier than my wife, who usually reads into the evening.  I’m sensitive to light, so I’ve tried several masks but settled on Sleep Master years ago.  I’m satisfied and grateful each day.  They are also great on flights and for when, perhaps due to jetlag) I need to sleep late (and the sun is up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service is also first class.  Enjoy this great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard P/NYC</li>
    <li> Great Mask!! Blocks light and very comfortable!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Sleep Master mask for about 3 months.  Comfort being subjective and relative to most other mask designs I&#x27;d agree with anyone that says this thing is very comfortable and very good at blocking light.  It even does a sorta decent job of muffling noise.    I&#x27;m writing this review as I&#x27;ve returned to buy another to have for laundry rotation.  If you try it and decide it works well, you may end up wanting another while one is in the laundry.  (Treat as a delicate.)    One important warning.  If you cherish your linen, you probably don&#x27;t want to try it.  As many have said the color in these things rubs off.  Even after washing.  Function versus ruining your pale pillow covers.  Why it gets 4 stars instead of 5.  Probably not something you&#x27;d want guests to see.  You&#x27;d want to plan ahead for that sort of thing, for sure.  Could make the difference between a great evening and someone getting turned off while wondering about your hygienic habits.</li>
    <li> Loved this mask at first.  Comfortable and kept the light out.  After using it for a couple of months I noticed that it was staining my pillow case and sheets. (Sheets are a off white.)  The only thing that I can think of that contributed to this is the fact that I do use a good moisturizer on all of my face prior to bed.  If i took the mask off in the middle of the night and put it next to me on the sheets- same thing-stains!!  I had to use a special remover to get it out of my sheets(RIT).  Not even bleach and hot water, in my washing machine, would take it out.   So if you don&#x27;t use moisturizer, it&#x27;s great, but be forewarned!!</li>
    <li> The Sleep Master sleep mask is one of the best sleep masks I have tried yet.  It effectively blocks light, is very comfortable with only a little slipping due to the soft, silky material.  The claims of noise reduction are a little overstated and the dye is leaving a black color on my pillow case!  I have a small head and the velcro strap is as tight as it can adjust, so it would be helpful if there was a little more velcro for those of us of smaller sizes.  Other than these little issues, the light blocking effect is GREAT!  (And this really WAS my main concern, after all.)</li>
    <li> Great mask and fantastic buying experience! Working a 12-hour rotating shift is a lot easier when you&#x27;re able to sleep during the day after being up all night. Thankfully as a result of the Sleep Master Mask, I&#x27;m now able to get my much needed rest even when the sun is up prior to having to go back to work.   I&#x27;m very happy with the comfort, fit &amp; finish, and over quality of this mask set. It does a wonderful job at blocking out ALL sunlight, as well as, attenuating most noises that would otherwise wake me up. With the soft earplugs in, I don&#x27;t hear a peep!  Thanks to the seller for providing such a great product and wonderful service!</li>
    <li> My sleep is the most important aspects of my quality of life.  The Sleep Master, with its plush fabric and comfortable adjustable velcro allows me to block out the world and fool me into thinking that day is night.  My ex husband is a cop who works nights.  He used to put tin foil over the bedroom windows to darken the room because he couldn&#x27;t find a comfortable mask.  If I liked him, I would tell him about the Sleep Master.  But I don&#x27;t so I won&#x27;t.  Stock in tin foil will just have to continue to rise.</li>
    <li> I love my mask.  I don&#x27;t worry about a little light leaking in around the nose because if I close my eyes it&#x27;s quite black because of the rest of the mask.  I tend to move around a bit and the mask moves too.  No troubles I just readjust the mask and drift back away.  Very comfortable.</li>
    <li> This product works great. It is comfortable and it does block out noise. It does not move around, like others I have tried.  Very reasonably priced. It elimanated me from using ear plugs, which are a pain to put in, and fall out too much.  Steven N.Muller  SLEEP COACH  [...]  [...]</li>
    <li> Very soft and comfortable.  If you sleep on you back, in the back where you Velcro the sides, it creates a slight bump which is bothersome if you sleep on your back. Otherwise, I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0015NZ6FK Revolutionary, Patented SLEEP MASTER tm Sleep Mask]]  I have allergies as well, and have not found this to be a problem at all with this mask.  It is VERY comfortable no matter if you are a side or back sleeper or if you like to move all over when you sleep.  My sister was visiting and was complaining about her husband who snores.  When she saw my mask, she just had to have it, especially since it comes with earplugs as well.  I ordered one for her so she would have it when she got home.  She absolutely loves it!</li>
    <li> I am a light sleeper and have been trying things for years.  Pills, masks and earplugs.  Of all the masks I have tried, I loved this mask best for many reasons. The best was that it comfortably covered my ears, instead of a thin strap going over the ears and putting pressure there all night.  It is think and feels great on the face.  Unfortunately I had an episode last week where I apparently opened my eye, while sleeping (not this product&#x27;s fault) and my eyeball dried out and stuck to the fabric.  It was extremely painful and caused a \\&quot;fabric textured\\&quot; abrasion on my cornea.  An ophthalmologist appointment and two days of recovery, and I&#x27;m now back to 100% but have been told I can&#x27;t sleep w this style of mask.  I&#x27;m sad that I sleep w my eyes open because this is a great mask if you don&#x27;t do that.  I however, will need to wear a contoured mask from now on that protects my eyes better.  So really this rating is a 5+ if you close your eyes while sleeping.  For people like me, who might open an eye unconsciously, this mask will hurt you, quite literally, as it puts a gentle pressure against eye while sleeping.  I liked hat, until my eyeball stuck to the fabric.  Ouch!  Wish they made a version of this one w contoured cups to protect eyes AND the thick comfortable head band.  That would be exactly what I need.</li>
    <li> If you work crazy schedules and sometimes (or always) you need to sleep in the day time, this very comfortable Sleep mask will take you the night I the middle of the day.</li>
    <li> I love this mask!  I was skeptical at first, since I had never seen a mask like this, but it was well worth the money.  My husband sleeps with the TV on, and I can&#x27;t stand any lights when I sleep.  This mask blocks it all out, better than any other mask I&#x27;ve owned.  It&#x27;s soft and doesn&#x27;t slip around too much.  Held together with Velcro in the back, but I never undo it.  I just slip it over my head.  It&#x27;s very comfortable, and it&#x27;s really changed my life.  It&#x27;s so nice to be able to sleep without being annoyed by the TV or other lights in the room!</li>
    <li> Very good at blocking light, but the velcro closure is bulky and directly under your head if you sleep on your back.  I pull it down behind the nape of my neck and it&#x27;s ok, but I&#x27;d prefer if it were on the side (side sleepers may disagree). The silky material is prone to rustling noises too, though the included earplugs block that out.</li>
    <li> I work shift work and for years I went through the effort to black out windows with visqueen and tape. What a pain. Now I just throw this on and sleep through the day without any problems!</li>
    <li> The mask does an excellent job of blocking out light, letting virtually no light leak under its corners on even the brightest day. It&#x27;s comfortable as the fabric breaths very well, meaning it won&#x27;t make your face sweet, and the mask feels soft and comfortable on the skin. Properly adjusted it also stays in place well without having to apply uncomfortable pressure. It also works whether you sleep on your back, side or stomach; even if you shift around as you sleep (as almost everyone does) the mask stays on with no constant adjustments needed. As is surrounds the ears as well, it blocks out some noise as well, but you&#x27;ll still want to use earplugs in a noisy environment; luckily earplugs work nicely with this mask. With that combination, you&#x27;ll have no trouble blocking out the outside world almost completely; today it took me ten minutes to notice my alarm had gone off...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe would be that there&#x27;s no concave indentation for the eyes, meaning the mask presses very lightly against the eyes. This felt slightly uncomfortable at first, but after a short period of adjustment, I&#x27;ve had no trouble getting through a full night&#x27;s restful sleep with this mask. If this is a deal-breaker, you might want to look at other masks that might suit you better. But for the majority of people, I&#x27;d say this is definitely a very good mask that I&#x27;d wager will last quite a few years, and definitely worth a buy at this price point!</li>
    <li> The mask comes in a plastic pouch.  I opened the pouch, touched the mask long enough to hold it up to my face (BTW, it does seem to block the light very well) and could taste the dye in the mask.  No, my tongue never came into contact with the mask, it only contacted my hands and eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never be able to sleep with the mask on.  The taste lingered for hours after just touching the mask for 30 seconds.  This shows me that the dye gets into your body through your skin, and that can&#x27;t be healthy.  I did notice several reviewers who had the dye leak onto their pillow, so the dye seems to be a problem.  It&#x27;s too bad, the mask would work well if it weren&#x27;t for the fabric it is made out of.</li>
    <li> After reading many of the reviews I&#x27;m thinking that maybe human heads and noses have a lot more variety than I realized.  I&#x27;ve had two sleep masks before this. This is so much better than either it&#x27;s ridiculous.    1. It&#x27;s a lot larger than the average sleep mask. So there&#x27;s a lot more room for casual movement without sudden flashes of light. I doubt any mask will keep all light out under every condition unless you are gluing it to you, especially for people who have big noses or a facial arrangement that puts the bridge of nose far out from from far-sides of eyes. But this does much, much better than both my others. Also there&#x27;s a lot of extra strap room for me, but I just saw a review where a guy griped he had to sew on extra velcro. Boy he must have a head the size of a pumpkin! Some people do I guess. I have a fairly small head and it is quite a bit longer than the other 2 sleep masks I had, so I think it is well proportioned for this kind of product.    2. It&#x27;s true the back-strap is nicely padded and large. If you wear it low (more toward base of skull) it&#x27;s not a bulk problem but probably at the straight back of head, for people with very firm pillows, sleeping on their back, it certainly could be. For me, my hair was always getting stuck in the velcro of my other sleep masks which drives me nuts. This one the velcro is only 1/3 the width of the back of the mask so it keeps my hair out much better. Plus, you get it tightened &#x27;just right&#x27; and you can pull it on and off and you don&#x27;t have to use the velcro anymore. I like the padded wrap-around personally.    3. It&#x27;s very soft. But really, most eye masks are soft. Like the other two I&#x27;ve had, there is a bit of adjustment period needed, because make it too loose and anything will turn/slip if you move enough (this far less than the others), but too tight and you wake up with your eyes gritty-red and blurry. This seems more forgiving than the others though.    4. This thing with the noise-blocking is so hilarious. Come on, this is just cloth with slight padding. It does wrap around your ears. This is mostly useful for helping keep earplugs IN. (Note that it comes with earplugs but anybody who really REALLY needs quiet should buy those individually for best quality.) Does it block sound? Ah, about as much as pulling a blanket over your head would block sound, which is to say, maybe some degree of distant ambient noise that doesn&#x27;t matter much anyway, but not really at all for any acute or loud sounds. Wrapping around the ears is far more comfortable than the strappy-sort of eye masks I&#x27;ve had before that are chafing, irritating, move too much, and bug my ears, so I love that it covers my ears, but that has nothing to do with sound for me... if you need quiet don&#x27;t depend on this for it. It&#x27;s for eyes. Deal with the ears in some other way. I didn&#x27;t count that as a selling point or I&#x27;d have made this 4 stars. I think it&#x27;s just a side-effect of the design they found a positive marketing road for.    5. Many reviews mentioned color-bleeding but apparently they fixed that some time ago. Mine doesn&#x27;t bleed color on my white cases. Another reviewer said his kept fraying excessively and immediately. I wonder what on earth could be on them or the pillow or head chemically or otherwise to cause this? since it happened to more than one mask with him -- I can only say that my mask is not so far fraying in any way. Another reviewer said if you have a big head the excess velcro sticking out &#x27;sticks to the pillow.&#x27; I wonder if he has some old design, because on mine, the part that is exposed is the soft cotton side of the velcro, not the &#x27;hooks&#x27; part.    6. As it is considered healthier to sleep in a cool room rather than a warm room and I don&#x27;t live in a hot climate and have climate control, I haven&#x27;t had it be &#x27;hot&#x27; on me. If I were having hot flashes like one reviewer, well yes, then it would be hot, but come on, anything would be hot under those conditions, the mask is very nice but itcannot trump menopause. If you live in a really high humid climate and don&#x27;t have climate control, then I would think a padded eyemask might not be the answer and maybe some kind of soft weave fabric against solid black plastic outside would be better for those situations.     7. Is it worth the money? Well it&#x27;s worth it to me but that amount doesn&#x27;t break me or anything. My buddy says he made his own eyemask out of an old t-shirt and it worked great, maybe the truly poor should try that. Sleeping well is worth a lot to me and so far this thing is really cool. I had given up on eyemasks for a variety of reasons until I was morosely shopping for yet another and found this one with all the reviews and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;m glad I did, and I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Works well for the time being.  I haven&#x27;t got use to wearing something over my eyes when sleeping.  It completely darkens everything whike sleeping,  so I would recommend if you work nights and need to sleep during the day.</li>
    <li> I had used masks before that had just the basic elastic strap - those would bother the top of my ears.  But this Sleep Mask is so soft and doesn&#x27;t cut into the ears because it rests on top.  The sound muffling aspect is great.  If there are dogs barking or something loud, you&#x27;ll need ear plugs, but the mask on its own just creates a nice sound filter...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend!  In fact, I bought a mask for my mom and each of my sisters for Christmas!</li>
    <li> This is the best mask out there. It is incredibly comfortable and blocks out all light. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I was having trouble sleeping at night, due to the light from outside. After trying this product I have to say I&#x27;m very happy with it. It blocks out all the light and it&#x27;s easy to get used to. Washing it is quick as it doesn&#x27;t take a long time to dry. The strap allows you to have it as loose or tight as you want, so comfort isn&#x27;t a problem. The material is soft to the touch and very comfortable.</li>
    <li> It is definitely a nice and well constructed product but I sleep on my back and the overlapping velcro closing at the back of the mask digs into my head and bothers me after a while and I have to take it off. It also flattens my hair a lot, which does not happen when I wear a mask with just a narrow elastic band that goes around the back of my head. People sleeping on their side, like the model in the picture, won&#x27;t have the pain on the back of the head but may still get the flat hairdo in the morning.</li>
    <li> I love this sleep mask because it covers a huge portion of your face, plus your ears, so it blocks out all light and most sounds as well.  You can sleep on your side without it shifting and letting in the light, and it&#x27;s soft and comfortable.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this mask specifically because I sleep on my side and most sleep masks have seams and bulk on the side which press into my temple and give me a headache.  This mask has been great.  Great for blocking the light.  Blocks some sound (though not why I bought it).  Soft and comfortable.  The only issue that I foresee is that it might be a bit hot to wear in the summer.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I bought this sleep mask.  I read some reviews and found out for myself that I agree with the 4 and 5 star reviews.  Some of the comments I read from the 1 and 2 star reviews I found were not as bad.  For example, one person said that the mask rubbed on her eyes during rem sleep.  In my opinion, I think, that she had it too tight.  It rubbed on my eyes but when I loosened it just a bit, it was fine.  Another issue people said they had was that it was uncomfortable when laying on it.  I have a down pillow and the softness absorbs the mask so that I don&#x27;t feel it at all.  I like the fact that it is made out of a satin material.  It is not hot like some other masks.  Some people make comments that it leaves a black residue on the pillow case.  I have a dark blue pillow case, so I don&#x27;t notice any stains.    Bottom line is that I am not only getting more sleep, but I am reaching a deeper sleep so I am more awake in the daytime. THIS MASK IS ACTUALLY IMPROVING MY LIFE.     I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> It get&#x27;s pretty hot.  That would be my major complaint.</li>
    <li> I am getting really irritated with Amazon.com letting sellers make hundreds of fake reviews for themselves. This is the second product I buy upon reading an overwhelming number of 5 stars reviews and that turns out to be total garbage (before I purchased a book that was so devoid of content, I had to dispose it in the garbage so much I was embarrassed).    I purchased this mask a few days ago and I couldn&#x27;t return it because the S&amp;H would have cost me as much as the price itself. It is very uncomfortable on the back of the head and unlike the claim \\&quot;built-in sound muffling\\&quot;, it doesn&#x27;t block noise AT ALL.</li>
    <li> I wear this every time I need to sleep and it is still bright. it is very comfortable as long as you don&#x27;t overly tighten the strap. been using it about 1-2x a week and brought it on my plane trips. still looks new and I&#x27;m confident that it will still last with me for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is able to completely block out all light sources with the correct fit.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom who can&#x27;t sleep without a mask on. She goes through them fast due to the elastic. this one wraps all the way around with only a piece of Velcro. She LOVES it!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many sleep masks and was pleasantly surprised when this one actually worked! Zero light comes through and it&#x27;s very comfortable! The material doesn&#x27;t make me sweat and is quite soft. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> For the past 5 years after a painful event in my life which I won&#x27;t get into... My sleep suffered tremendously. I just couldn&#x27;t sleep at night... I tried everything...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Dangerous prescription-grade pharmaceutical drugs (Valium and other powerful sedatives)&lt;br /&gt;-Melatonin \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; Supplements. (No matter how high of dosage... It had zero effect on me. And there is nothing \\&quot;natural\\&quot; about putiing a hormone in the body from a external source which affects the entire endocrine system of the body.)&lt;br /&gt;-Sleep positions&lt;br /&gt;-Window shades and darkening the room as much as possible during the night. (Ineffective.)&lt;br /&gt;-Hypnosis (What a fraud!)&lt;br /&gt;-Sleep Masks (Pretty much all of them except for this one don&#x27;t work because they are poorly very engineered so to speak. Remember there is a reason why this sleep mask of all things has a patent... Because all the other competitors lack the innovation to manufacture an effective sleep mask.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sleeping barely much and when I did it was during the day hours. My sleep quality was also very terrible. I woke up with headaches, still extremely tired and very unrefreshed (If that&#x27;s a word.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This continued on for the past 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After getting this sleep mask... ALL my sleep problems seemed to have just honestly magically disappeared literally overnight. I can now sleep easily and quickly at night  without any issues. I have also noticed that I am only sleeping like 5-6 hours with this sleep mask yet I honestly real feel like I got a good 10 hours of sleep...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unbelievable. I woke up today... Looked at the clock and was a bit shocked that I only slept 5 hours yet for some reason I was not tired at all but extremely energized like I had gotten plenty of sleep. (10 hours).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now 6:41pm and I still haven&#x27;t felt an ounce of fatigue, grogginess or drowsy as I am writing this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sleep mask for $25? It&#x27;s too much? Let me tell YOU what&#x27;s too much... Having the lifestyle of a drug addict even though you have never even done something as small as marijuana in your life or gotten drunk from alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The complete transformation in my life this has made was nothing for $25 dollars. Sleep master please keep my $25 dollars and I&#x27;ll keep my physical and mental health that your product has benefited me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fabric and stitching quality of this product extremely high quality. I have not seen any sleep mask on the market (I have a lot of them) with level of fabric quality than this one. The stitching is very very sturdy too. The comfort is the ultimate kicker!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a big nose... Very big nose... And pretty no sleep mask except for this one was comfortable for me. This is for all sizes! And it  doesn&#x27;t build up heat or induce sweat while you sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t worry about the price for this. If you are being stingy by thinking \\&quot;Oh $25 dollars for a small piece of fabric...\\&quot; You are thinking wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think about the benefits you will get from a product like this. I already mentioned them... Today I woke up after only a week of having this product with significantly less black eyes than in the past 5 years. I have no headache or fatigue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product blocks COMPLETE light to the eyes causing the body to release melatonin: A powerful anti-aging anti-oxidant hormone that tells the body to sleep and also induces high amounts of HGH and DHEA to released which also has many anti-aging anti-oxidant properties. The body than has lowered cortisol and adrenaline which ages the body, increases risks of heart disease, high blood pressure and obesity.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those of you who have a circadian rhythm disorder this is your real natural cure! Not the veneering as \\&quot;natural\\&quot; melatonin \\&quot;supplements\\&quot; (really drugs actually) which the FDA should step in and not make available without prescription. Did you men out there know by the way that so-called \\&quot;natural\\&quot; melatonin drugs can shut down your natural testosterone product, shrink the testicles and stop sperm production eventually?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well there have been several reputable documented case studies which have showed without any doubt that you should not being taking this drug unless prescribed by a well-qualified physician.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The safe way to get your melatonin is with this sleep mask because you will not pumping the body with a hormone from an outside external source which can cause the entire endocrine system to shut down. (It thinks if it is getting a hormone from a outside source, what the use in being active?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t make this yourself most likely anyway for you frugal folks out there. It will be too time-consuming anyway and not worth the effort. Don&#x27;t take my word... Research all the sleep masks out there. They suck! The are not durable, not comfortable, don&#x27;t fully block light and overtime become more expensive due to replacements. They also fall off. (Further diminishing effectiveness.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sleep mask is actually a complete bargain for what it does... Those sleep drugs are actually very expensive (at least the ones dangerous enough to be effective and effective enough to be dangerous). They can also cause very expensive health problems. Hope you have very good medical insurance if the drugs mess up something major in your body. (They eventually will)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just my unbiased take and how see spending $25 dollars on this as really good investment for your mental and physical health which many other dangerous remedies for proper sleep will end up costing you more money in the long haul and will not be a long-term cure but rather a short-term management. (Those drugs get ineffective until you need a higher dose or a completely new and more dangerous drug.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ear plug included also pretty much make  things almost completely silent. With the combination of complete sound and light blockage... I literally completely pass out dead... More dead than any drug I&#x27;ve tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s up to you... $25 for some weak-a$$ drug over-counter at CVS or this sleep mask which is a natural long-term remedy more effective than the most powerful sedatives that hardly any doctor will every prescribe for anyway plus the risk of death from those drugs plus addiction.</li>
    <li> I Love it&lt;br /&gt;Helps me sleep well.&lt;br /&gt;Recomend to everyone who has problems sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;Very soft&lt;br /&gt;helps me sleep better</li>
    <li> Sleep Master is too thick.  It heats up your head. research has shown that the head needs to stay cool for quality sleep. Also it hurt my ears, since i am a side-sleeper. When pulled down to hide all light, it slightly restricts breathing thru your nose.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and the shape is really good at keeping light out.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Changed the way I sleep.  I got this for my night shift, but now that I work days, I still use it because it helps me sleep so much better.  It is nice and cool, and helps cut out that little bit of noise from my husband&#x27;s breathing.  I have long hair and I just tie my hair in a pony on top and strap the eye pillow on and go right to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
    <li> Great product!  The mask is the best one I have ever used and very comfortable.  I just wish it came in a jersey shirt type material instead of the satin because satin can be pretty noisy but feels good on the skin.  But you have to get used to the noise the satin makes which the first night woke me up a couple times.</li>
    <li> The best blackout mask I have owned so far!</li>
    <li> Not only a great sleep mask, but also wonderful for just taking a total relaxation break with feet up (your favorite music optional). Which, of course, frequently results in a much needed nap!</li>
    <li> This mask is comfortable and good at blocking out the light. The little notch to fit your nose is a must, but if not positioned properly can tend to either cover my nose too much, or let in a little light if I raise it too far. The adjustable velcro closure is much more durable and convenient than masks with elastic bands. The one issue I&#x27;ve personally encountered with this is that it makes listening to music/talk radio a little difficult while falling asleep since it covers the ears, but that&#x27;s a personal preference and the design clearly shows it will cover your ears. All in all, really good quality for a sleep mask and worth a few more dollars than standard elastic banded ones that don&#x27;t cover enough of your face.</li>
    <li> The perfect Sleep master</li>
    <li> The material is soft and is not uncomfortable. However, this is definitely not revolutionary and does *not* block out all light. The material is thicker than a cheapo mask, but if you open your eyes with the mask on you can still see light through the material. Draping a t-shirt over my eyes is more efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The material also absorbs a lot of oil from your face. Expect to wash it frequently, like once every 7-10 days minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not completely garbage, but not revolutionary either.</li>
    <li> the mask is bad. she leaves the face at night. and if you push too much to not escape, disrupts sleep</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s comfortable and blocks out all light if you sleep on your back, but it moves around too much when/if you sleep on your side which is extremely annoying. I haven&#x27;t used it very much because of this, so it&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
    <li> This perfect concoction comes with ear plugs and is made with material softer than a baby&#x27;s bottom.  Pair this mask with a chamomile/valerian root cocktail and prepare your brain for a night&#x27;s dream that will put Christopher Nolan and Salvador Dali to shame! Become impervious to neighbors who wake up at the crack of dawn to mow their dead lawns 3 times a week, the dogs next door who howl like beached sea lions fleeing from Jaws himself and team them up with a light brighter than Danny Boyle&#x27;s Sunshine.  Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I lost my sleep master mask recent trip to Europe and I really regret it. This thing is nice because it doesn&#x27;t have a strap. It uses the padded facemask all around your head so it covers your ears a little bit to drink and keep your earplugs in a little better.</li>
    <li> This mask is terrific!  The fabric is silky, the length very generous, the closure is velcro.  There is room for it to ride low on the face, cover the eyes and ears.  A much more comfortable and better fit than those with the tiny elastic bands. It helps keep my eyelids closed and relaxed without pressure. Great product!</li>
    <li> When I first saw the mask, I wasn&#x27;t sure I would actually wear it. But, I use it every night now and it works!  The mask wraps around your head, so the ears are covered just enough to block out most noise, but not all. I don&#x27;t use the ear plugs though -- I feel that would block out all noise and could be dangerous. Love it!!!!  ZZZZZ!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Sleep Master for years.  It&#x27;s light weight, muffles some sound, and most important to me, blocks all incoming light!</li>
    <li> Arrived way before set arrival date. Love it! I am sleeping way more sound in the mornings when the sunlight comes through my window with this on. Highly recommend...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May 7 update - I received another sleep mask free for leaving feedback! Going to make a great Mothers day gift. It could happen to you!</li>
    <li> My personal opinion for this is that it is unnecessary to pay more for what seems to be &#x27;too much&#x27;. When I bought this, I haven&#x27;t thought about that the back part can stack up against my pillow. I feel awkward that there is something behind my head when I lie on bed. I didn&#x27;t return it because I bought this to use in the airplane anyways.</li>
    <li> Doesnt block out as much light as you would think, and not as easy to sleep sideways, but its better than many others I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> The product is phenomenal. The seller was super. I&#x27;ve been having lots of issues sleeping and this mask has solved the problem.</li>
    <li> I have only used this mask once and it works. great.  I have been using sleep masks for many years and this mask is great.  A lot of people complain about the mask hitting their eyelids.  Every mask I have worn affects my eyelids and this one is no different and is something I have become use to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask is very soft and covers my  eyes perfect.  There is a touch of light that comes through the nose area but with a little adjustment it almost disappears.  I like the fact that there is no more Velcro.  Velcro last for a couple of months and then I have to discard the mask.  I also like the fact that it covers up my ears a bit and blocks out the noise from the tv.  My wife watches tv late but doesn&#x27;t turn the volume up loud so it blocks the noise out just enough.  I know these masks are not suppose to block out any noise so don&#x27;t expect them to block out a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would order another pair of these but I feel without the Velcro these masks should last a LONG time.  I hope to get a year, if not longer with these.</li>
    <li> Satin is slick and slips around if you move at all at night.  Not for sleepers who move around or even turn over at night.  It is soft and does block light well when it is on.  Definitely NOT a value for the money but the seller was very professional.</li>
    <li> I have trouble sleeping during the day, but since I work nights I have to. If you&#x27;ve ever used an eye mask before you might have some of the same problems I did.  They fall off because you move around or cut into your eyes because of the strings.  This solves both of those issues, and if you use ear plugs this does keep them in place as well.&lt;br /&gt;  My only one glaring issue might just be a personal one.  I naturally run a little hot (very warm blooded) and can&#x27;t wear hats because of it, so about half way through the night I wake up in a sweat and have to take it off.  The only way around that is to layer down on the sheets and equalize my body temp.  If you&#x27;re not like this then that might make this a 5 star for you.  My wife is like that and she now steals it away for the heat.</li>
    <li> This was my second purchase of Sleep Master.  The original one has lasted for over two years, through many washings and still works like a charm. But, I decided to get a second as a backup in case I lose or misplace it somehow, traveling or whatever.  I&#x27;d always been a night waker, even with the sleep masks I&#x27;d tried in the past. The difference in the quality of sleep I get with THIS mask is remarkable.  Without fail, if I wear it, I sleep through the night. If I don&#x27;t, I fall asleep okay, but wake up several times during the night.  I don&#x27;t really understand the how and why, but I guess I don&#x27;t need to. I figure I get at least an hour more of sleep a night with the Sleep Master and I can&#x27;t put a price on that. So buying the back up, even if it&#x27;s only just in case, was a good investment.  I recommend night wakers try this one.</li>
    <li> This mask is awesome. I&#x27;ve been sleeping with a mask for about a year and this one is the best. I love the complete coverage as well as the fact that it&#x27;s a noise buffer with the design going over the ears. We have a newborn and so the lights are off and on a lot all night so my husband tried out the mask and I haven&#x27;t gotten it back! Going to get another one, worth the higher price over other masks!</li>
    <li> I love this new sleeping mask! I have been using one with a thin strap for years now &amp; never knew what I was missing out on! Will never go back. Item even came with a handwritten \\&quot;Sweet dreams :)\\&quot; on the receipt.. Huge fan of this transaction &amp; seller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most masks come with an adjustable strap (that&#x27;s too thin to do anything with) that tend to loosen up during the night. This mask is pretty wide all the way around so it never feels uncomfortable, and the strap is Velcro so there&#x27;s no uncomfortable mettle or plastic adjuster getting in your way of a great night&#x27;s sleep. My room is right near a house with a neighbor who pretty much has a spotlight for a yard light &amp; this thing will go off as so much as a mosquito flies by 10 feet away.. So I&#x27;m definitely glad I have this mask now, ALL the light is blocked out.. &amp; very comfortably.</li>
    <li> This is much more expensive - so I thought it would be better than the Bucky - but it isn&#x27;t.      The [[ASIN:B000FIJ07G Bucky  40 Blinks Mask Ultralight Eye Mask]] puffs up a bit - and makes room for your eyelashes.  This one doesn&#x27;t.  So I actually never use it.</li>
    <li> Very soft and comfortable. Perfect for long trips</li>
    <li> Not so much noise muffling. Good color though.</li>
    <li> Material doesn&#x27;t breath very well and is to hot for me to sleep in.</li>
    <li> Great product, fully blocks light and also gives some level of protection from noise as it covers your ears as well. The only sticking point is the price. A star out for the price, otherwise good sleep mask.</li>
    <li> Love this mask!  I use it every night.  It is comfortable and it keeps light out and earplugs in.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> My hubby snores AND gets up earlier than I do, so earplugs and sleep masks are necessary for my good nights sleep. This eye mask does the trick...completely blocks light and doesn&#x27;t fall off my face while sleeping; it even blocks the \\&quot;cracks\\&quot; around my nose where light likes to sneak in.  The earplugs are pretty standard, but work if inserted correctly. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> A very pleasant, silky mask with decent coverage and the over-the-ear design is oddly comforting with no &amp;#34;strap bite&amp;#34;. I do feel that the mask could be improved with some additional, built up cushioning along the bottom interior edge. All in all a cozy and stylish item that will look and feel great in that big, business class seat!</li>
    <li> This really is one of the best travel accessories I have ever owned. Very, very comfortable and really does block out virtually all the ambient light. I thoroughly recommend this. Worth spending a bit more rather than those cheaper ones available at airports.</li>
    <li> For people with sleeping problems, the mask makes a good difference, at least it did for me. Sleep Master sent the mask quickly and the materials used on the mask don&#x27;t make you feel hot. It&#x27;s really soft and comfortable.  Good Product!</li>
    <li> Very comfortable material. Ideal for sleeping in less than ideal conditions.</li>
    <li> Upon my opening the box containing the Sleep Master, I was a little discouraged and skeptical of the blindfold-esque appearance.  But after trying it, let me say: Wow!  The satin and soft padding are wonderful and not bulky, just a slightly mushy cushion (i.e., a non-issue if you&#x27;re a side-sleeper like  I am).  The best parts (it&#x27;s a tie) the gentle frame around the nose blocking all light without impinging on your breathing whatsoever &amp; the sound dampening effects of the padding over the ear.  It&#x27;s a gem of an invention.  6 stars.</li>
    <li> this product was horrible. It made me feel claustrophobic and my skin couldn&#x27;t breathe with it on.&lt;br /&gt;The free ear plugs were awesome though.</li>
    <li> Bought this mask as a gift for my sweetie, who&#x27;d taken to sleeping with a huge pillow over his head to muffle the sound and light in our noisy, bright bedroom.  Most of the sleep masks I saw only covered the eyes, some came with ear plugs (ugh), but this one looked like it would do everything the Giant Muffling Pillow was doing but do it better (and with less smothering).  He&#x27;s been using it for several weeks now and it&#x27;s a big hit -- very comfy, and the ear covers seem to send him into a deeper sleep much sooner (I&#x27;m the night owl with a reading light, rustling noisy magazines and such, which he&#x27;s now totally, blissfully oblivious to).  Only wish I&#x27;d found it for him years ago!</li>
    <li> I bought my first Sleep Master sleep mask in December, 2009 after trying many different types of sleeping masks, all of which did not work that well - uncomfortable, let in too much light, flimsy, and got tangled on the tie cords.  Then, when researching alternatives, I stumbled on the information for Sleep Master.  I ordered the mask, which was quickly shipped.  My wife likes to read in bed and I start the day at 5 AM going to the gym before going to work, so I really needed an effective sleep mask.  I noticed right away that the Sleep Master was different from the usual mask, it was soft, comfortable, effective at blocking out light, and even had side cushioning to block some sounds, along with a set of enclosed earplugs to further attenuate the sound.  It&#x27;s also very durable.  I still have the original Sleep Master I ordered in 2009 and use it at night, so it is well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, when my daughter who lives in a college dorm, complained her roommates made too much noise and they flipped on the lights in the dorm room at 2 and 4 AM, I quickly ordered a Sleep Master for her since it has worked so well for me.  It came within a day or two, and I was able to help my daughter get some very needed restful sleep before her midterms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good thing about my review is this review is not just my initial impression of Sleep Master, but an impression and product that has stood the test of time.  If you want a peaceful night&#x27;s sleep, in my opinion, Sleep Master is a good solution.  It sure beats the other sleep masks I have tried and enabled our family to get better sleep.  I also take this mask when I travel and it is equally appreciated and effective.</li>
    <li> The sleep mask has been great. My husband snores and my home computer is in my bedroom (lots of little red, green, and blue lights from laptop, etc.). The mask definitely helps shut out these sights and sounds so that I can get to sleep more easily and quickly.</li>
    <li> Love this thing. Very useful to sleep at night while the boyfriend watches tv. Muffles sound and keeps light out, and it&#x27;s very comfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> I would say its mabey a bit more evolutionary than revolutionary. It has more padding and covers your eyes &amp; ears properly, though, it&#x27;s sound muffling properties are mild as expected.  It&#x27;s like other sleep masks only better. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble falling off to sleep. One of my buddies bought this sleep mask for me.  I didn&#x27;t even try it for a couple weeks because I&#x27;d tried the whole sleep mask thing years ago.  I&#x27;d still just lay awake, only then, with my eyes covered. :-( But then one night, I said what the heck and put it on.  Lo and behold, the next thing I knew, it was morning--and the same thing ever since. Aside from BIG thank you&#x27;s to my buddy, I owe the Sleep Master people one, too -- THANK YOU!!!!!</li>
    <li> Wow, what a really nicely made sleep mask. It&#x27;s designed with comfort in mind. No elastic strings to bother your ears, soft material that feels great on your face, and obviously the most important part, it keeps the light out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a shift worker and need to be able to sleep during the day. I had just moved and couldn&#x27;t find my old mask. I jumped on Amazon to take a look at what was available and after seeing the excellent reviews decided on the Sleep Master Sleep Mask. Not only were they able to get it to me in 1 which was important to me, but the quality exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone that needs a sleep mask, it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> this is by far the best sleep mask I&#x27;ve ever owned - it does a good job of blocking out light all night long, and I love that its safe to wash and will last a long time compared to all the other masks I&#x27;ve bought in the past (most everything else is made with foam which tends to fall apart after a few months, or much sooner if washed). This mask also helps reduce noise without blocking it out completely (something most other masks can&#x27;t do, and using ear plugs is not a good idea, especially with alarms that you don&#x27;t want blocked out while in a deep sleep! This mask has turned out to be much nicer than I expected, and exactly what I needed to help me get a good night&#x27;s rest.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product! I absolutely love this sleep mask and my sleep quality has dramatically improved. Would purchase from SLEEP MASTER again. Highly recommend product and seller. Quality of product is excellent and incredibly comforatble. If you are looking to purchase a high quality sleep mask, this is the one.</li>
    <li> This product just has passed my expectations; when you are wearing it you can feel its comfort and it is almost imperceptible.....I have used it also during my romantic nights ...WOW  IT IS PERFECT!!!</li>
    <li> Use every night and put in the fridge in the morning.  If you have a soul and like feeling good, spend the money it is a nice way to relax as you fall asleep.  If you don&#x27;t then you are missing out, and a moron, for how much this costs it is totally worth it.</li>
    <li> This company is outstanding in service and in product. I wish I worked for them! I reccommend it for anyone who wants a good night sleep (or any time!)This is an awesome well manufactured product(US made). I am glad I searched a little more to find this one of a kind sleep aid. Bravo!!! I had outstanding service from start to finish. I can&#x27;t wait to go to sleep!!</li>
    <li> After my last long airplane trip where I couldn&#x27;t sleep during the trip nor for a week afterward on account of jet lag and not preparing my trip properly (I had an aisle seat instead of a window seat), I spent sleepless hours in the middle of the night scouring the web for a good sleep mask.  This one looked the best, it is made in the USA, and on my last plane trip, it worked like a charm.</li>
    <li> I started using a t-shirt to cover my eyes around 13 years ago when roomed with someone who worked shift work.  While I don&#x27;t have someone keeping me awake at all hours these days, I have found that something covering my eyes helps me sleep and after 13 years, I decided to try this night mask instead of a t-shirt.  I am glad I did.  This is so much more comfortable than the tshirts I&#x27;ve been using.         Someone said the velcro bothered them, but unless you generally sleep on your back and have a hard pillow, I doubt you will have a problem.  I have slept on my back many times with this, but have a nice down pillow and haven&#x27;t really noticed the \\&quot;velcro bump\\&quot; in the back.       The only reason I give it a 4 is that it does bleed onto all my pillowcases...even after 2 months.  I tried washing it right after getting it, but even after two months it often leaves blue to black stains on my pillowcases.  I&#x27;ve only reused one of the sheet sets since I got it and I did notice that not all of the stain was removed in washing.  Personally, I find the stains much worth the benefit though.</li>
    <li> I love how this fits over my face and really blocks light without squishing the top of my nose. Great design!  Comfortable!</li>
    <li> Cheaply made. Does not fit my head. Can still see light. A total piece of junk.</li>
    <li> I finally found a sleep mask that also covers the ears too! They should all be like that, not only for comfort, but also to tune out sounds (you also have to use the ear plugs to really tune out). It is very comfortable and it covers very well. I sleep on my side or stomach so I love that it&#x27;s smooth on the sides.</li>
    <li> Good but too expensive.</li>
    <li> Well I hoped this was the one...looked so cozy online.  Actually it is pretty cozy, but a little too warm.  I really like the idea of the wide side straps, they&#x27;re perfect for covering your ears and adding a little more sound proofing...and if you use earbuds it can help block out more ambient noise (and muffle your music a bit for whoever&#x27;s next to you).  They also sent a pair of great NRR 33 ear plugs.  With all that said though, they fell a little short for me.  The silky fabric turned out to be much warmer than I expected, and a magnet for face oils.  The biggest turn off was the color.  I was slightly concerned looking online because it appeared like it could fall a little on the girly side and unfortunately I was right...it kind of resembled wearing a pair of women&#x27;s underwear from the 90s around my face.  A little more blue and a little less turquoise (or just grey or black) mighta done it.</li>
    <li> Very slippery material. Keeps sliding off.</li>
    <li> Too thick to wear in summer.</li>
    <li> The sleep mask arrived fast and is very comfortable.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> I had to return this because it was very uncomfortable.  The mask is relatively flat and does not provide a convex shape to accommodate the shape of your eye or eyelashes.  I found that it pressed on my eyes and lashes</li>
    <li> Hands down the Very Best.......Revolutionary, Patented SLEEP MASTER Sleep Mask....I&#x27;ve ever tried....super comfy... best one after all I&#x27;ve tried in many years blocks out everything!~</li>
    <li> I work at night so I sleep during the day. I have tried every other mask and this is the best one by a long shot. Item arrived extremely quick. Very pleased</li>
    <li> The mask is comfortable and completely blocks out any light. The only problem is that sometimes I awake to find the mask fell off&lt;br /&gt;during the night. Still, a great buy.</li>
    <li> It takes some getting used to (wearing something around your face) but this thing has definitely helped me to sleep.  I recently changed to a night shift and have no trouble sleeping during the day with this thing on.  I was concerned about the noise dampening bit, that I would oversleep and miss my alarm, but no such trouble.  I think the noise dampening might help muffle sounds somewhere like an airport, etc, but I can still hear sounds just fine.    As for the reviews about it hurting the eyes, I&#x27;ll agree that the padding is right up against the eyes, but I haven&#x27;t had any substantial discomfort.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask has provided me with the best sleep I&#x27;ve had in a very long time; even after starting shift work at the mine where I am employed. It&#x27;s a snug fitting \\&quot;head band\\&quot; face mask that completely blocks out ALL light and helps muffle loud outside noises (such as cars or trucks, loud dogs, lawn mowers) that would normally keep you from falling asleep. I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> My second sleep mask. I&#x27;ll be going back to the previous one. This is thick, stiff and only cuts out the light if you put it on so tight it&#x27;s like a tourniquet. It gave me headaches. Nice color and fabric, though.</li>
    <li> This product performs exactly as described.  Blocks out ALL light.  I work 3rd shift and sleep during the day.  I have tried other cheaper ones, and they just don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> Best sleep mask EVER! Worth every penny. So comfortable. Never pulls on hair or leaves a face mark. Fits like a glove. Love it. Well made. Arrived quickly. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Nicely padded and great eye coverage. Also, full covering of ears makes for a cozy and quiet sleep. Wife loves it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t emphasize enough what a wonderful product this is.  So comfortable and provides noise reduction as well.  Could not sleep without it.</li>
    <li> I bought the SLEEP MASTER Sleep Mask because I have severe dry eye and my eyes can get extremely irritated when I sleep if they are not protected well.  I live in the desert and to avoid too much warmth in my bedroom which causes too much irritation I need to have the airconditioner on most of the year and use the ceiling fan.  Both the fan and the air conditioner can dry the eye out too if my eyes aren&#x27;t well protected. The SLEEP MASTER Sleep Mask is a gift.  All other masks have slid off my head during the night and have, as far as I am concerned, been a waste of money.  With the SLEEP MASTER Sleep Mask I get a good night sleep, the mask stays in place, it&#x27;s comfortable, and my eyes are not only protected but they actually feel normal when I wake up.  Severe dry eye can be very irritating particularly as we age and I hope more people who have this condition are helped by my review.</li>
    <li> Finally a good nights sleep.The sleep mask used with the ear-plugs works exceptionally well. An exceptional product. i am very pleased!!!     RogerH</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is wonderful!  This sleep mask is soft, covers the ears to muffle sound, fits snugly for different sized faces.</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive to light and noise when I sleep. This mask has transformed my ability to go to sleep quickly and stay asleep no matter what light or noise is present in the bedroom. Since my husband is a night owl and I have to get up very early, our bedtimes are very different. Now with this mask his late nights don&#x27;t make any difference to the quality of my sleep.</li>
    <li> bought as a gift and the recipient loves it</li>
    <li> I bought this for my partner who wakes up at any hint of light. He&#x27;s tried the standard eye masks before with traditional shape in the front with the elastic string back, or the skinny velcro back, but, he always complained that they would slide around while he slept and therefore would fall off his head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got him this mask because I always felt those standard eye masks were so small and silly. He loves it and uses it nearly every night. He loves the fact that it&#x27;s so large that there is no chance any ray of light will get in, and he likes that it goes all the way to the back holding the mask in place throughout the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t really noise cancel but for blocking out light, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I work nights and I sometimes have trouble falling asleep during the day but this is GREAT! Seriously, I was tossing and turning and once I put it on and I fell asleep right away!</li>
    <li> This mask works a lot better than the little cheap one I had before. Very soft and silky and comfortable. The fact that it is adjustable with Velcro is also a huge plus.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask sucked :-/</li>
    <li> Effective Sleep mask,thoughtfully designed! WASHABLE, (which means hygienic and long lasting rather than disposable and good for travel) Light on the face, and adustable.  Worth the price. The careful design says to me that the sleep master folks really care about their product and are sensitive to the essential service it provides. I am greatful.</li>
    <li> This mask really does cut out the noise and all light! However, there was a problem for me because as much as I loved the mask, after a few hours of wear your ears will hurt. The mask pushes hard on your ears and after time it becomes painful. The mask is great for naps though just don&#x27;t plan on waring it all night.</li>
    <li> I have used many different sleep masks and have always been disappointed with all of them.  They are either uncomfortable, the elastic is flimsy and wears out quickly, or they quickly slip off in the middle of the night and don&#x27;t provide blocking of light when morning comes.  The SleepMaster sleep mask is of excellent quality, is very comfortable, stays on through the night, and doesn&#x27;t have flimsy elastic to wear out.  It wraps around your face and head very comfortably and even  forms little earmuffs to block out some sound as well as keeping the light out.  Yes, it might cost a little bit more than other sleep masks, but this might be the last sleep mask that you ever buy and that makes it an excellent value.  If you&#x27;ve been looking for a good quality sleep mask that will last you a long time will keep on your face through the night and will be comfortable, I highly recommend that you check out the SleepMaster sleep mask.  I think you will be as happy with it as I am.</li>
    <li> I gotta say, I was a bit surprised by the size of this sleep mask.  I don&#x27;t have a particularly small face (normal sized, I would say) and it extends far up my forehead and down my cheekbone.  A bit more than it shows in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the material does seem like it may be cool.  Maybe I haven&#x27;t given it a fair chance yet, but I can say I just haven&#x27;t used it too much, preferring my old one, since it seemed to get a bit hot.</li>
    <li> First of all, the effect of this product on my sleeping was instant and amazing.  I have never used a sleep mask before, so I was a little apprehensive about wearing one, particularly after reading some of the criticisms below.  I tried the mask for an afternoon nap the day I got it.  It felt mildly odd when I put it on for the first time, but it was very soft, comfortable, and adjustable, so I got used to it almost immediately.  I had a great sleep that afternoon and have slept beautifully ever since. (Not the case before I started using the mask.)      The mask really blocks out the light and the padding muffles sound well, but not completely.  That&#x27;s actually a plus to me, because it blocks out just enough sound to remove distractions, but no so much that I can&#x27;t hear my husband, the alarm clock, etc.  I suspect that if you used the earplugs that come with, you could really block out almost all sounds, if that&#x27;s your goal.      It&#x27;s also easy to slide the mask up and on your forehead and back down onto your face; you don&#x27;t have to completely remove it or re-Velcro it to temporarily look or move around during the night.    Now, to the downsides.  Because of the padding, the mask can get a little warm over the course of the night.  However, in spite of being warm-natured and living in a warm climate (Texas), I don&#x27;t find it at all uncomfortable.  I don&#x27;t even notice that it IS warm until I take it off--and suddenly my face feels cooler.  So I&#x27;d agree with those reviewers who remarked on this point, but unless you are really, really warm-natured, this shouldn&#x27;t be a dealbreaker.    Also, I did notice some of the black rubbing off on the pillowcases.  However, the black washed out completely and the problem also seemed to diminish after the first washing of the mask.  (I cautiously hand washed the mask in Woolite and let it air dry and that seemed to work well.)  I&#x27;m guessing this is a problem of fibers rubbing off while the mask is new, but even if it&#x27;s not, the improvement in sleep is well worth this minor inconvenience.    In short, if you&#x27;re hesitating buying this product because of the problems noted in some of the other reviews, in my opinion the plusses far, far outweigh the minuses.</li>
    <li> So good, I&#x27;ve ordered another for my travel bag.  Finally after many different product attempts and tryouts, I&#x27;ve found a comfortable solution -- love this great item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this mask. It provides a wonderful sense of calm and quiet which allows for sound sleep, and is so comfortable, you&#x27;re likely to forget you&#x27;re wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall, is that the black dye in the fabric comes off in your bedding.</li>
    <li> The mask is too thick to breathe and feels suffocating.  Also, in order to block the light and not slip down your face, it presses against your eyes.</li>
    <li> Great product! A little overpriced.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually like anything on my head when I&#x27;m sleeping, but this was actually relaxing. I did take it off sometimes, but for the most part it stayed on and stayed in place (and I toss and turn a lot during the night). It was comfortable and calming. As others have said, it helps keep ear plugs in place.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd sleep mask I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  What I really like about this mask is that it actually stays on the entire night and provides great light coverage and is comfortable.  I love the fact that the velcro straps are adjustable and it&#x27;s a very well made product.  I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times so far so I&#x27;m not sure how easy or often it needs to be cleaned.  Extremely satisfied with the product!</li>
    <li> After wearing for a few weeks the bottom of the mask begin to fray ever so slightly. The tiny strings of fabric were itching my cheeks and nose while I was trying to sleep, very annoying.</li>
    <li> Is really confortable I dont have problems for sleep but some times want to take a nap in the day I very happy to purchase this mask I never find some even similar the quality of the material are the best too and come so fast great costumer service .</li>
    <li> I am really happy I bought this mask, I&#x27;ve had it about a week and I am thrilled with it. The texture of the fabric is very soft which feels really nice, it helps my ear plugs stay in and the cushioned effect eliminates the lines that other masks leave on my skin (this was my main reason for purchasing this product, my skin marks very easily and I had previously had elastic marks on my face for a couple of hours after using other masks). I also wasn&#x27;t too hot despite the very warm weather we&#x27;ve been having recently. The adjustable velcro at the back is perfect, allows you to adjust it just to the right size (and it would seem to fit quite big heads too!) Overall, I&#x27;m thrilled with this product.</li>
    <li> Muy buen producto para proteger los ojos de la luz al dormir, y así poder hacerlo profundamente. La forma de la máscara cubre totalmente los ojos, y el belcro con el que se ajusta impide que se mueva de su posición.  muy recomendado para las siestas de la tarde!</li>
    <li> My work schedule changes a lot, so a good sleep mask is important to me, and this is the BEST I&#x27;ve ever found.  It&#x27;s so comfortable, I always forget for a moment I&#x27;m wearing it and just think the power went off and that&#x27;s why the street lights aren&#x27;t bothering me.  It also muffles sound somewhat by itself, and with the earplugs it comes with, I hear absolutely nothing.  And the customer service is GREAT.  I wrote them to ask what kind of ear plugs they sent, because they were amazing, and the company was so nice they sent me a couple of extra pairs for free!  I couldn&#x27;t recommend this mask or this company highly enough!  Could not be improved upon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note - if you have oily skin or use a moisturizer before bed, you&#x27;ll notice your skin slightly black when you wake up, the dye in the mask seems to cling to anything oily.  Washing your face as normal takes care of this, but to prevent it, I washed my mask with olive oil then detergent and that removed all extra dye so I no longer have that issue.</li>
    <li> The dye will stain your pillow, that&#x27;s almost certain. It is a fairly comfortable sleep mask, but not optimal (if there is such a thing, short of a custom fit). I&#x27;ve seen other reviews as well that say a little bit of light will still show up from underneath. Yes, this is true, although I imagine it depends on your face. My theory is that a female face will better fit this mask because the more prominent forehead that males tend to have may push it out of whack and cause some opening towards the bottom. Also, if you move around a lot during the night, it won&#x27;t stay perfectly in place. As far as the advertised sound blocking attributes, they&#x27;re almost non-existent. You will need to put on silicone ear plugs to block out noise; either that or cut foam ones in half. It is a soft mask though.</li>
    <li> I need a sleep mask because my eyes get very dried out during the night. I need a mask that is comfortable, adjustable, and isn&#x27;t too tight around the eyes or the top of the nose.&lt;br /&gt;I had one I&#x27;d been using for a few months from another manufacturer, but even after washing, the color (black) would bleed onto my pillowcases during the night. And it pressed too much at the top of my nose, blocking air flow. So I found this one, it&#x27;s more expensive, but well month the extra few dollars!&lt;br /&gt;It covers my eyes perfectly, no light leakage from the bottom or sides. The material is soft, but sturdy. Just the right amount of padding. It&#x27;s impossible for my hair to get caught in the Velcro, as frequently happens with other masks.&lt;br /&gt;This is the perfect sleep mask. I won&#x27;t buy any other brand ever again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very soft but was a little heavy for me.  The Velcro kept it in place but it got a little hot.</li>
    <li> I bought these thinking, pay a little cash and get the best night sleep. Wrong, they did not block out all of the light. Also they slipped off, and I could not use them.</li>
    <li> if you run cool at night then this is the I shaved for you it has some padding in it so it kept my had to warm actually but my wife loves it.</li>
    <li> I bring this eye mask for every trip - plane ride, hotels.  I use it at home home of course too.  The review by the person who was considering putting in plastic spoons for the eyes made me laugh!  I, on the other hand, like to wrap the mask as tight as I can over my eyes.  I have puffy circles under my eyes that get considerably worse with allergy season.  I feel as if the light pressure from the eye mask helps push the extra fluid back into circulation.  I really feel rested and look better in the morning, unlike an effect of feeling like I just completed a night of crying.  So - sleep well and look rested when you wake up!</li>
    <li> Great sleep mask. Very comfortable. Completely blocks out light.</li>
    <li> THIS IS FIRST TIME IN MANY MONTHS THAT I HAVE EXPERIENCED SUCH A RESTFULL AND PEACEFUL NIGHTS SLEEP!  I CANNOT BEGIN TO SAY HOW WONDERFUL IT IS TO SLEEP WITHOUT THE BLASTING SOUNDS OF A TELEVISION WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO GET A GOOD NIGHTS SLEEP.</li>
    <li> I have had trouble with sleeping for many years.  I have found this mask help the with the light issue.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because of one reason ( probably more like 4 1/2 stars ) -  I have purchase 3 of these so far - I tend to use a new one if I go somewhere - but sometimes it falls off at night. Other than that it is perfect.</li>
    <li> My husband needed something that didn&#x27;t say &amp;#34;diva&amp;#34; on it:) So I started checking out different sleep masks, because he needed to start going to bed before the sun went down.&lt;br /&gt;After doing some research I went for comfort. This sleep mask is extremely comfortable. It works well, I can even turn on the lamp without waking him up!&lt;br /&gt;The only trouble we had with it was that my husband moves around a lot in his sleep and the mask eventually slips around some, but it&#x27;s so comfortable that he doesn&#x27;t notice until the morning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sleep mask for about two months now and I love it, I can&#x27;t sleep without it! I am a very light sleeper so it helps that it gives me full coverage from light and muffles sound. I sleep way better as well. I am going to keep buying this product over and over as long as its still available.</li>
    <li> I really liked the mask--much better than the ones with elastic bands.  Comfortable to wear and blocks out light well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mask for years.  There&#x27;s nothing else like it for great sleep.  It&#x27;s soft, comfortable, fits great, blocks all the light and washes nicely.  Everyone can use some help relaxing sometimes and this mask is great for home and travel. So it makes a great gift. I have bought a couple recently that I plan on giving as hostess gifts at upcoming holiday parties.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about four months and just can&#x27;t take it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to not have light come from the nose area you need to make it a certain tightness level. The back is about 4 inches tall and the velcro is less than 1 inch and it aligns right with my eyeballs. In order to make it also tight enough that it does not move up or down or off my head when I move around while asleep the pressure digs into my eyeballs. (My former sleep mask had the tighten &amp;#34;line&amp;#34; at my eyebrown and it was padded up around the eye area so it could be tight to the head but not tight on the eyes themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This closes with velcro, there is no elastic. Comparing to my former sleep mask (which I used for over 3 years until it wore out) which had elastic and so it was self-adjusting to my head and did not move around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The satin going all around the head is slippery, it slides on my hair and face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do sleep with earplugs and it does give some protection against rubbing the earplug on the pillow so it does not accidentially pop out of your ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to get used to this being so wide and going all around the head. I felt it was warmer than I like since it adds warmth to the head and scalp. I live in humid hot Houston where we use the air conditioning nearly every day and I wore this through the summer and it felt too warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The darkness level is great if you can tolerate the pressure on your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had a love/hate relationship with these, it seemed 4 stars in the first 6 weeks or so, then it started stretching by the nose area and I had to make it tighter and tighter to keep the light out. Their money back guarantee is only good for 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end I rate this 1 star &#x3D; I Hate It.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking for a new decent, comfortable sleeping mask. No matter what the cost I need one that works and does not fall off, does not slide, is not painful or uncomfortable and keeps the light out.the light out.</li>
    <li> This mask was everything I wanted and more. It completely blocks the light, it is comfortable (the satin finish keeps it from feeling too hot), it stays on well with the velcro closure, and by covering my ears the also included ear plugs stay in all night. I am a back sleeper and the velcro closure does not bother me at all, which I was concerned with after reading other reviews. With the ear plugs I am able to sleep all night despite my husbands night train snoring. And when I wake up now at night I am able to fall asleep much quicker instead of being up for an hour or more. I am looking forward to bringing this on my overseas flights, I might actually be able to sleep for once. In my opinion there is not a better sleep mask on the market and it is worth every cent. It has changed my life!</li>
    <li> I could sleep all day with this mask.  Super comfy.  Good fit so no light gets in.  Light enough that you don&#x27;t even feel it.</li>
    <li> My favorite sleep mask and washes well in the washing machine &amp; dryer.</li>
    <li> For me, this is generally quite a good sleep mask, and it fits snugly without being tight. Light is blocked well, although obviously sound is not. I use it while my wife watches TV in bed via a [[ASIN:B00BGGDVOO Roku 3]] (headphones attach to the remote), so all I need blocked is the light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern, which is relatively minor, is that there is nothing keeping it off my eyelids, so there can be a very slight bit of pressure from the mask depending on how I position my head. It&#x27;s not enough to stop me from falling asleep or staying asleep, but it is noticeable. Those with sensitivity issues might prefer a sleeping mask with more protection around the eyes.</li>
    <li> This one is very soft and comfortable to wear. However I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve made it a whole night without it coming off, which defeats the purpose. It&#x27;s just some Velcro on the back that keeps it together. Also, some light comes in from the nose. Searching for a more functional mask...</li>
    <li> I really wonder about those positive reviews. The opening around the nose will only fit if you have a really small nose and will otherwise let a lot of light through. If you lie on your side there is a material that makes noise next to your ear. Worst sleeping mask that I have ever had. I took it abroad and missed the dead line to return it. I wish I could send this piece of junk back to sleep master. I am actually annoyed by this product. Buy if you have a tiny nose and like noise. Rubbish!</li>
    <li> My son asked for this. He&#x27;s in college and the slightest amount of light will wake him up. He told me that this mask blocks out all the light and feels great. He has been getting the best sleep ever. He thanked me over and over for buying this for him. Yes, it works.</li>
    <li> The mask covers the area by the nose and blocks all light. it doesn&#x27;t put too much pressure on eyes. It also blocks out most of the noise around you... a problem with our alarm clock. It also slides around your head if you move around too much in your sleep. the fabric is very soft and comfortable.</li>
    <li> I bought this mask a couple months ago and do not regret it. The mask does let a little bit of light in right around the nose, but the room has to be terribly bright for it to be noticeable. My fiance tried it and is now thinking of buying one himself.</li>
    <li> This mask does not block the light any better than other masks. Light comes in from the nose area.</li>
    <li> Sleepmaster is truly a Sleepmaster.  I had always wanted a sleep mask just to block out the morning sun. I went on line and stumbled across sleepmaster. I was impressed with how it looked , very form fitting and comfy looking. Than I seen where it would muffle noises.&lt;br /&gt; That is when I said this is for me. I bought it and for the first time since I married my husband not only is my sleep comforting and dark, but it is snore free.  I had to always put a pillow over my head to help try and drown out the noise. Not any more.&lt;br /&gt;  I have two grown daughters who I showed the mask to. They both wanted one.  One of my daughter had the conventional type of sleep mask.  She wanted one like Mom&#x27;s. They both got there wish. It made for wonderful stocking stuffer&#x27;s for Christmas. They both love them and are telling there friends. I give it a total thumns up.. Thank you SLEEPMASTER.&lt;br /&gt; Sandra, from Ocala Fl.</li>
    <li> I use a CPAP machine because I snore and have sleep apnea. I purchased this sleep mask to prevent air from blowing into my eyes.  Works great.</li>
    <li> Used it for a few months, no complaints.  Blocks the light well and mildly helpful for decreasing sounds.  Stays on well with position changes (I&#x27;m a side sleeper).  No painful pinching/rubbing that occurs with straps.  It does mess up the hair as likely most sleep masks do. Eventually though the black dye started to stain the pillow case and sheets and wouldn&#x27;t come out in the wash.  I even hand washed the mask a few times but continued to do so.  Eventually threw it away.      Update: I emailed the company re: the ink.  They had a batch of masks improperly dyed and were getting similar complaints.  They sent me another one, no charge, and I haven&#x27;t had a problem since.  Excellent customer service.  My only regret was not having emailed them sooner.  Ignore the 2 stars, I would give it a four at least.</li>
    <li> My fiancé bought this for me for my birthday. I&#x27;ve been wearing a cheap airline eye mask and he wanted to get me a nicer one.  He bought it because it had excellent reviews and while it&#x27;s nice, it does not work well if you are a back sleeper.  Instead of an elastic band to keep the mask in place, you wrap it around your head and Velcro holds it into place.  However, the Velcro portion on the back of the head is so thick it does not make for comfortable sleeping.  I removed the mask part way through the night and went back to my cheap airline one.</li>
    <li> My wife watches TV at night and I can&#x27;t stand the noise, Not only does the mask make it dark, it also muffles the sounds around.  If you need that little bit before you get to sleep, this mask is great.</li>
    <li> Completely blocks out all light, super comfy, and I cannot believe how much of the face it covers, exactly what my husband needed after working midnights! Perfect!</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is excellent.  It is not uncomfortable and feels good.  It provides full black out.  It is great quality.  I like using it for a day time meditation session.  In the early daylight on my day off my cat will wake me up but I just put&lt;br /&gt;on the sleep mask and catch more sleep not hindered by the morning light.  I am taking this on my next trip for those long airport delays.</li>
    <li> Very effective product does exactly as it says it should. Slept great with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Would Personally Recommend To anyone with sleeping issues!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outstanding sales and customer service and fast shipping as well.</li>
    <li> I had never used one of these before but I was hoping to get some relief from the sounds of my pets running around in the morning. I was surprised how comfortable the mask was and it shut out light very well. As far as sound goes I would say it &amp;#34;muffles&amp;#34; sounds but you would have to use the earplugs for more complete sound deadening (which I wanted to avoid). All that being said the reduction in noise is just enough to not be responding to every noise I hear! Overall I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the best mask i Ever used, i bought the second one because i lost the First one And i can not sleep with out it!!! Super confortable&lt;br /&gt;Pricey but worth it</li>
    <li> After trying a couple of cheaper eye masks and not being happy with them,&lt;br /&gt;I decided to spring for this one. It&#x27;s a bit more expensive but it has a lot of&lt;br /&gt;positive reviews so I thought maybe it might work well for me too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using it maybe 5 or 6 times despite the lack of comfort and finally&lt;br /&gt;decided to just give up. I will say, it wasn&#x27;t as painful as the cheaper ones&lt;br /&gt;I tried, but still, that&#x27;s not saying much.&lt;br /&gt;I thought for sure it would block out all the light too but it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Light would still come in near the middle where the cut out is for the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I put it on tight, it stays in place reasonably well but the pressure&lt;br /&gt;it applys on my eyes causes a bit of pain. Loosen it and and just slides&lt;br /&gt;off while I&#x27;m sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the reviews are very helpful but in this case, not so much.</li>
    <li> I usually wake up without it because it&#x27;s so smooth and soft that it falls of of my face overnight. However, I&#x27;m able to fall right to sleep when my partner is using his computer or has the light on. I put this on and it&#x27;s dark!! I can&#x27;t speak much on the noise it reduces since I don&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
    <li> This is a very good quality mask.  It is lightweight and soothing and blocks light, dampens sound and is very comfortable to sleep in. I would recommend the Sleep Master.</li>
    <li> Not sure why this gets good reviews. I sleep with my eyes slightly open so suffer from very dry eyes. When I saw the comments&lt;br /&gt;on how it presses on your eyes I was glad. So ordered it. Used one night. The material is so slick I woke up and found it on my pillow 4 times, woke up and pulled back into place I have no idea how many times.&lt;br /&gt;So I guess if you do not move all night it would be good, but if you move at all due to the material used it was useless.&lt;br /&gt;The claim that it helps block out noise is just silly. What a waste of money. Going back. Returned less than 24 hours after receiving.&lt;br /&gt;Also due to design the nose portion makes it difficult to put in place and the fastening kept coming undone as well. I have short hair and this just slid off repeatedly. Again, if you do not move it would be fine, but for me and the way it would not stay on even one night makes it terrible, not to mention I am REALLY tired cause I kept putting it back on all night. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> bought for my hubby who works nights sometimes this helps him sleep a lot better keeps light out for him they even included ear plugs how nice</li>
    <li> Slips off and out of place. Hot and touches eyes more tHan I like. Summer wear is not practical here</li>
    <li> This product is great.  Had Purchased two other brands and they did not keep the light out, or stay secure on my face. Been using this product for a couple months now. No complaints, works great.</li>
    <li> I had thought that I wanted another memory foam sleep mask like I used to have from Brookstone--it had eye wells on the inside, was comfy, and made for complete black out.  But this one is actually more comfortable and just as good as blocking out light.  It&#x27;s also easier to peak out to see what time it is without then having to readjust the whole thing.  Less bulk on the sides for side-sleepers.  Very comfortable and effective.</li>
    <li> I like that it is large, &amp; comfortable. The noise dampening over the ears is nothing but marketing hype, but the cushioning of the ears help if you sleep on your side. I shave my head, and every mask I&#x27;ve tried leaves a mark on my skin from the pressure for a good 30-60 minutes in the morning, this mask included.</li>
    <li> i did not like it due it is too wide in the back. It warms up too much my ears. However my mother and wife liked it. That is why i gave it a 4 star.</li>
    <li> Works well enough. Doesn&#x27;t block out sound. Does block out light. More comfortable than regular sleep mask. Probably better for those who don&#x27;t care about bed head.</li>
    <li> Great for bigger faces. My husband loves it,</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t sleep without it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m light-sensitive and live in Alaska, so I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect sleep mask for years. I ordered this mask for a trip and I ran into a few problems. First, its rather large and covers the ears, I was in a warm climate and found it too hot to wear. It doesn&#x27;t offer any nose muffling so I didn&#x27;t really understand why it was made to cover the ears. The mask lets light in where the nose and cheek meet, but its significantly less light than any other mask I&#x27;ve tried before. It&#x27;s my current go to mask but I&#x27;ll continue searching for the perfect sleep mask that doesn&#x27;t allow light in.</li>
    <li> I bought this with hopes that it would muffle some of the noise from my husband&#x27;s CPAP machine. I should have known better by looking at it. The mask also has a tendency to slip around. I</li>
    <li> filling was wierd and i returned this item- not breathable outer fabric was satisfctory, so if the filler was better i might have kept it</li>
    <li> just what i wanted, and got it quickly. where it loose or you will think you are going blind upon waking</li>
    <li> I love this mask - it has helped me sleep far better than I have in years and isn&#x27;t really noticeable while sleeping.  It seems that I sleep with one eye partly open, and was suffering severe pain and multiple eye issues before I started using this.  Not only does it block the light, it gives very slight pressure to help keep my eyes shut - and thus prevent them from being exposed all night, which was causing the excruciating pain every day.  The velcro keeps it on securely and allows you to adjust how tightly you want it to fit, and the design prevents hair from being stuck in it.  Overall I am very pleased with this sleep mask!</li>
    <li> This is the first sleeping mask I&#x27;ve used.  I went out on a limb buying the most expensive one. But really, it has been worth every penny.  It&#x27;s very soothing, blocks out all light and the fit is easy to adjust to head size.  I am sleeping so much better because of this fantastic mask!</li>
    <li> The total package / comfortable / stylish / and blocks out light and muffles sound.  The Sleep Master now goes with me wherever I travel / my last trip passengers on the plane kept asking how to get one / simply a well done product / 5 stars from me!</li>
    <li> The Sleep Master is the best mask on the market.  It works better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s comforting, adjusts perfectly, stays on all night (the first I&#x27;ve found that stays on!) and keeps all light out.  What more could you ask for in a sleep mask? It costs more than most others, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for great sleep.</li>
    <li> They only thing is that it comes off during the night but that may be because I&#x27;m smaller than most women. It is comfortable and really does keep the light out.</li>
    <li> It fits amazing not sure I will ever be able to sleep without it!!! It is velco instead of tie and it nicely covers my ears.</li>
    <li> In particular when you sleep with AC or a fan, this very comfortable mask is a must. Will cover the ears too to muffle sounds. The material is a sateen type, and it feels soft and smooth, without causing typical strains or lines from typical masks. Use it all the time nearly a year later.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny! So incredible!  I don&#x27;t even know why!  I slept until 2 pm! And its very comfortable to wear!  A must-buy!</li>
    <li> I bought this cause I switched to nights and it worked perfect and felt even better, you barely even notice its on. If you get bothered by light well sleeping get this.</li>
    <li> Got this product for my wife and she loves it.  Totally relaxing and keeps all of the light out with maximum comfort.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is soft, smooth and very comfortable to wear.  It fits nicely around your ears and helps keep ear plugs in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One suggestion: I&#x27;d like this product with option to have built in headphones for use with mp3 player/cell phone.</li>
    <li> The design of this mask is great. I love that it covers my eyes and ears. It&#x27;s very comfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my son who has trouble sleeping during lightening and thunderstorms. It helped tremendously!  Great price, too!  :)</li>
    <li> Cheaper masks quickly slip, stretch out, or just never fit me. Although I hadn&#x27;t expected this mask to be SO VERY LARGE, the velcro closure and padding made it fit comfortably without squeezing or getting hot. I doubt it will stretch or wear out as others have... not for a very long time. Even those with long hair can wear this product with little to no fear of snagging, tangling or pulling of hair while sleeping.  It also blocks out light perfectly! A++</li>
    <li> I have trouble writing, because I am groggy, I blame the mask for that ! I slept so well with this Sleepmaster mask !! Highly Recommended. I have Roommates and work the graveyard shift. I sleep during the day. This mask made me believe they all went on vacation, and I had the whole quiet house to myself!! Get one !! and drift away!!</li>
    <li> I have tried many sleep masks, looking for the one that would work well with the CPAP that I have to put on nightly. The CPAP (goes on first) attaches an air hose to my nose (using the nose pillows) which requires a head strap wrapping around the forehead to the back of the head. The many sleep masks I have tried uses the stretch bands which wear out that compete for space with my CPAP, usually by movement the stretch band and starts cutting into the ear skin where the glasses rest. The Sleep Master is the most comfortable that I have come across. The Sleep Master uses wide solid satiny materials and uses Velcro to connect the two material ends. Using Velcro only once for a just right fit all the time, the satin material slides comfortable OVER the ears NO competition with the CPAP. It&#x27;s a fit like I never felt with other brands and covers the eyes for the desired effect.&lt;br /&gt;Tom</li>
    <li> I am a super light sleeper.  I combine this with ear plugs to try to get the best sleep I can.  The material is soft and doesn&#x27;t get too hot or cause me to sweat underneath it.  The fact that it covers the ears is a nice touch to help with noise, although its effect is not dramatic on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smooth material however means it moves easily on your skin and hair.  So once you&#x27;ve positioned it in and then hit the pillow, it can easily shift slightly and let in light under the mask.  If you turn a lot at night this may become problematic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish there were a 3.5 star option to use on this.  I went with 3 since in the end I have not used this on a regular basis after the first few months.</li>
    <li> I read all the positive reviews and thought I would be getting a quality product. Wrong. This sleep mask is bulky, uncomfortable, and poorly designed. First of all - why all the material?? It&#x27;s hard enough to have something on your face when you&#x27;re trying to sleep. The space for your nose turns up after a few uses so that light reaches your eyes and the intended purpose of this product is defeated. Further, because this material is so thick, you will experience uncomfortable heat around your head. The material is also slippery so that it slips up and down your face. Not worth it for nearly $30. Do not get!</li>
    <li> The mask works well and I can finally sleep in on weekends. It blocks out all light sources, even afternoon sunshine. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. What more. An one ask for :) A tad bulky but so!!&lt;br /&gt;Ok - more words , hmmm, feels comfy !</li>
    <li> There is a giant flaw in this sleep mask. The satin fabric on the outside makes A TON of noise when it moves across a pillow or any other bedtime surface. It&#x27;s like sleeping with a windbreaker on your face!!! Definitely doesn&#x27;t help me get to sleep.</li>
    <li> Sad to say, I bought this Sleep Master mask primarily because of my snoring dogs that keep me awake. I&#x27;m very tired of using ear plugs and they quiet often get lost in the middle of the night from my tossing and turning. Granted the mask doesnt have a ton of padding as around the ears as some of the reviews have cited but it must be just enough. Either that or my dogs have decided to quite snoring lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have Insomnia and RLS so I have a pretty hard time getting good sleep.  When I do finally make it to sleep I do believe that the Sleep Master mask allows me to get a deeper sleep than I have been getting.</li>
    <li> This eye mask is super comfortable and blocks out all the light. I highly recommend for anyone wanting a good nights sleep.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the satin-style sleep mask. The part that wraps around your head was uncomfortable, I didn&#x27;t like the satin finish, and light was coming in from under my eyelids. Suffice it to say mine got returned.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is worth the price. Like another reviewer mentioned, it puts pressure on the eyes as there are no recessed areas like some other masks have and they are very warm around the head in the summer, especially if you don&#x27;t do well with heat at night.. That works out well for the winter however. They tend to rotate and slip off the head during sleep too. I prefer the less expensive sleep mask that costs about $8 at drugstores.</li>
    <li> I bought this mask for my wife, who works overnight at a hospital, because she has to sleep during the day. It provides a very high degree of comfort to her, keeping out almost all light. A big bonus that we didn&#x27;t expect was that the mask has full coverage over the ears as well, so it can function doubly as a set of ear muffs if your ears get cold at night while you are sleeping and you want to protect them. It also dampens sound considerably. The material is a smooth as silk. I would definitely buy a replacement if anything ever happened to her current one. She uses it every day. Totally worth it. I recommend it to anyone who wants a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
    <li> Received this mask a few days ago and first thing I did was wash it out with a gentle soap.  Do not use a fabric softener--I will explain later.  It is pricey.  Someone is making real money on this product.  Used it last night for the first time.  Took forever to dry.  Will wrap in a towel to absorb most of the water then hang to dry next time.&lt;br /&gt;It has a few design flaws in my opinion:  There is a fair amount of stress in the nose area.  It would have taken but a second to reinforce the nose curve with a few more stitches; the end of the Velcro strips nearest the end flaps should be tucked into the mask&#x27;s seam and then stitched (persons with longish hair who move around a lot as they sleep will find the Velcro tangling their hair); the end seams of the mask should be stitched over better at each end; and, the material, while pretty, is a polyester satin, warm against the skin, can be noisy, snags easily and most important of all stains easily.  If you have oily skin, sweat, use moisterizer or have on makeup while wearing the mask, you will see the mask soaking up all of the above like a sponge.&lt;br /&gt;Regular shampoo, rather than washing soap, used once in a while will remove these stains.  Using fabric softener, while making the mask smell good in the short-term, will make the mask more absorbant and \\&quot;floppy.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I am keeping my mask because I do not have time to look for something else. Flying out tonight on a \\&quot;Red Eye\\&quot;. I did trace out the outline on a piece of cotton fabric and hand sewed it to the inside of the mask for now. Washing the liner will be better than continually washing the mask. I also redid the ends by tucking in the Velcro strips and resewing the end seams.  Since I had thread on my needle, put a few stitches in the nose area.  All told it took me about 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this mask to a friend?  Not at this price.</li>
    <li> This is a good enough sleep mask.  It does, as advertised, work for side sleepers but it is not that stable and tends to twist around.  Fabric does not breathe all that well but again, it is good enough.</li>
    <li> material is too slipery. It slides around with even the smallest head movement, even if I have it tight. It slides off the head every time I wake up, even if in half hour.  Also doesn&#x27;t reduce sound.</li>
    <li> Total darkness as soon as you put it on.  No elastic headband that always seems to be right where I want to lay me head.</li>
    <li> My husband plays video games all night in our bedroom, on a large tv, making it very hard for me to sleep.. This mask is comfortable and large so it blocks the light ver well. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have tried several different sleep masks over the years, but SLEEP MASTER is the best sleep mask I have ever owned!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this mask. Takes it everywhere.</li>
    <li> This is a huge eye mask. HUGE. And nothing flimsy like those you would get for a buck or two. I feel that this is made for heavy duty uses. By no means am i sleep deprived or am sensitive to light, I purchased it simply because I wanted an eye mask just in case... anyhow, I did not regret my decision. Not sure about whether it would revolutionize your sleep for my friends who can not sleep unless it is absolute darkness, but the material is soft and both me and my sister have enjoyed it during our trip abroad. So go ahead and place your order if you are looking for a nice eye mask.</li>
    <li> REally disappointed in this mask. Firstly it does indeed smash the eyes and lashes.  You wake with lashes all caddy-wompass and slanted. I wash make-up off before bed so not a big deal.  But I can imagine how attractive you&#x27;d look after a little airplane nap. But worse, it is too thick for my taste and I would wake with a hot face.  I dont need any more of that.  Satin doesn&#x27;t breathe, after all.  The back velcro is noticeably &#x27;there&#x27; and needn&#x27;t be that thick.  Does it do the Blackout job it promises?  Yes.  BUt the thing covers about 2/3 of your head, so it should, right?  I&#x27;m returning this thing and ordering the less expensive &#x27;Bedtime Bliss&#x27;.</li>
    <li> sort of presses against my eyes, let&#x27;s in light near nose.  Also, I think it irritates the bridge of my nose. It also seems to make a lot of noise as the material rubs against my ears when if move. Soft material is more comfortable to me than foam.  I think there are a number of more comfortable and effective masks for the price. I&#x27;d recommend you take a pass on this $23 mask</li>
    <li> Made in the USA!  Blocks out the light, and is comfortable to wear even if you sleep on your side.&lt;br /&gt;It may get too warm in the summer.</li>
    <li> While the mask blocks most light and some sound I find it quite uncomfortable. I have a decently sized head, so the velcro is only connected for about half an inch. I sleep face up, and the velcro on the back of my head makes me feel like I&#x27;m sleeping on a little rock. I&#x27;d send it back, but it&#x27;s not worth the hassle.</li>
    <li> You have to wear the earplugs for the noise reduction. The padding does not do much...but it is pretty comfortable.</li>
    <li> This is the most comfortable sleep mask I&#x27;ve ever worn. It&#x27;s made of a material that stays pleasantly cool. The fabric goes over your ears, so you don&#x27;t need to worry about a band pressing at the tops of your ears. The whole construction is so soft that it doesn&#x27;t bother my nose either, which was a problem with some other sleep masks I was trying. It also does a great job of blocking out light. A little gets in from by my cheeks, but it&#x27;s so little that it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> Nice mask and would recommend it to anyone. The only problem is that it&#x27;s very large and real bulky to pack.</li>
    <li> For this price I expected more.  It leaves blue stain on all the sheets, and it&#x27;s some sort of faux silk material that gets grungy very easily.  Lastly, there&#x27;s no elastic in it so it doesn&#x27;t really fit your head snug and doesn&#x27;t typically stay on through the night.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this and the earplugs. Goes straight to sleep which makes for a happy life for me! No late night chat! Looking at other products this company offers. Great prices and service. I would recommend this product to those needing a great rest.</li>
    <li> I  am one who needs pitch black to sleep and as it has been shown it is much healthier to sleep in complete darkness a functional and comfortable sleep mask is ideal. Especially when rays of sunlight come through in the early morning and aftenoon. Its a great product , for the ones who needs a quiet time to get some rest after several working hours.</li>
    <li> This mask is great. It was just what I needed to get the rejuvenating sleep that I have not had in some time. The product is great quality and I highly recommend this to anyone questioning the purchase. Seller shipped fast and would not think twice about doing business with them in the future.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s comfortable to wear, stays on during the night, and doesn&#x27;t let any light through. It&#x27;s solidly constructed and seems like it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Incredibly comfortable on your face in any sleeping position, definitely helped me.  I would suggest to anyone that needs a little noise but can&#x27;t stand the light of a TV when they try and sleep.</li>
    <li> Finally, a sleep mask that is smooth and flat for those of us who roll over in our sleep. Very nice product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s comfortable in the front, but the back is actually less than ideal. The velcro is hard and can be uncomfortable when laying on your back. I&#x27;ve since reverted back to a cheap sleep mask given out on a recent flight (the small elastic bands in the back are more comfortable).</li>
    <li> My job started working me on third shift 6 months ago. For the first two months I suffered with a lack of sleep. I used a sleep mask that did not cover as much of my face, and was not as thick as this one. For a while I used a fan to blow air into a sheet that created a \\&quot;tent\\&quot; around my head while using the generic sleep mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally my wife searched for sleep masks for me. She showed me a few, but we easily landed on this one. The mask is adjustable to fit almost any head. The Velcro strip is very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This costs way less than black out curtains! The loft that I live in has a window at an angle that is 15&#x27; above my bed. Black out curtains were not an option for me... But this mask is better anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without this mask I would not be able to get 8 great hours of sleep every day!</li>
    <li> After owning this item for about two months I was initially very frustrated at the product slipping off while I was asleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It still does not stay on consistently, but I need to use it in order to sleep, because as a shift worker I am sleeping during the daytime. So I kept trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial review for this product was two stars, but I am going to upgrade it to three stars because what I discovered is that I was not fastening the mask tightly enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, sometimes I make it too tight and its uncomfortable. I tightened the mask too much the other day, when I woke up my vision was blurry for a good ten minutes, which was scary!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to research other sleep masks that are not made of shiny, slippery material like this one (its \\&quot;silky, and slides around)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to be funny, but this \\&quot;sleep mask\\&quot; may be better for other, ahem, bedroom type activities that don&#x27;t actually involve sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> This is an efficient seller, prompt, quick and confident. The confidence comes, surely, from selling a superb product. Washes and dries like a breeze, too, although you really should do this by hand as the maker suggests.</li>
    <li> it blocks the light and is a comfortable, smooth material.  Its kind of thick in the velcro on the back of your head, so if you lay on your back it may be a little uncomfortable.  Also, it covers a lot of your head and on hot nights I got pretty warm.  I don&#x27;t use it very often, i prefer others.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with other products and items made in China full of chemicals and other substances. Buy this American product that will not fall apart and is made out of high quality material. The pay off.... Amazing Sleep!!!</li>
    <li> No light slipping in the gaps here.  I love that this wraps around your whole head.  Keeps earplugs in place and you aren&#x27;t left with any rubber band like marks on the sides of your face from regular sleep masks.  The velcro on the back can do a number on your hair if you shift sleep positions a lot.  I had some sort of rasta dread starting that I needed to spend some serious time with a comb on.  Overall this is the best sleep mask I have had.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.  Love the way it blocks out light and little noises. Wonderful mask, and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable, lightweight, effective, not warm &amp; easy to wash sleep mask.  I work night shift, highly recommend for day sleepers.</li>
    <li> I have tried several sleep masks over the years as light easily agitates my sleeping patterns and most of the sleep masks would either break, not cover enough light or irritate my ears so badly I&#x27;d throw them away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sleep mask is light, soft on your eyes and wide enough that it covers your ears to give you more protection from light and sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love it and would recommend this product to anyone looking for a sleep mask.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product.  I hate having a blanket on my face (anything on my face while I sleep), however this is extremely comfortable.  I wish I would have purchased this years ago, it is an excellent product.  I can breathe comfortably and it blocked out all of the light in the room.  It does not block out much sound (at all), however that is not why I purchased this product.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0015NZ6FK Revolutionary, Patented SLEEP MASTER&amp;#0153 Sleep Mask]]    THIS is a sleep mask.  Total darkness, soft, easy to secure and doesn&#x27;t make me perspire like others do.  I can keep this on all day and not rip it off in my sleep.  It covers my ears which I was not even looking for and didn&#x27;t know I missed but now -for me anyway- I don&#x27;t hear any disturbing noises and I can wake up naturally without an alarm because I am so rested.  Get this one for sure.  Seller is fast and honest with shipping...did not gouge me like the last one did!</li>
    <li> I can read while she sleeps. She used to put a pillow over her head but this mask works great. She says it is very comfortable and wears it every night. The mask is well made, cool, light weight, and blocks out all light.  The best part is the company really seems to care about their customers. We had a small hitch because the product was imperfect ( construction of this particular mask had a flaw in the stitching, not a big deal). I emailed them and they jumped on it immediately, no questions asked. They sent a replacement that was perfect and we had it in a couple of days. Then they CALLED to be sure we got it and were satisfied. They seem to be a family business and are doing it right. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> --------The item shipped quickly and in good condition. I have been using it every night and it really has improved my sleep. The only complaint I have is that it works so well, sometimes it is hard to get up in the morning because it makes it easy to block out the world.--------</li>
    <li> I gave this blindfold as a gift to someone who uses a blindfold every night and also to go to sleep in a car.  She likes the ear covering, she is grateful there are no metal obstructions, and she really likes the silky feel.  She&#x27;s gone thru a lot of other  blindfolds before this, and says this is by far the best she has ever had.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m living with roommates at the moment, and unfortunately, they either enjoy leaving the light on or the door open (there&#x27;s no window in the room).  There&#x27;s not much there to block the light, so I was left out to dry.  I saw the sleep mask on Amazon for the first time, and thought that I would give it a try.    The sleep mask itself has no strap in the back, and instead secures itself via a velcro strap (did I spell that correctly?  &gt;&lt; ).  I found this convenient, as I found the elastic strap of my previous sleep mask to be rather uncomfortable.  On top of that, the extra width of the strap allows you to cover your ears, which helps to muffle any outside ambience, even without the earplugs that are provided with the package.  The Sleep Mask has improved my sleeping habits.  I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I have been a very satisfied customer of this company since I first discovered their product in 2002.  I make sure to buy a new Sleep Master every year.  I wouldn&#x27;t dream (no pun intended) of sleeping without one anymore.  I also give them to my friends and co-workers at the holidays.  It&#x27;s an inexpensive, thoughtful and useful gift, and they make excellent stocking stuffers!    Every person I give them to agree with me about how helpful this mask is for sleeping.  It really works to induce a deep and refreshing sleep, and the quality/durability of the mask is much better than any other mask I have found.  Service is also important to me, and theirs is fantastic, with a real personal touch.  I think that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a family owned business, and they really care about their customers.    A fabulous product and great customer service is a tough combination to beat.  I strongly recommend Sleep Master.    As a repeat customer, I am to happy to see so many great product reviews on Sleep Master at this site, and elsewhere on the Web.  Perhaps there are a handful of people in the world for whom no sleep mask will ever work, but rest assured that this mask is the best and most comfortable on the market - I know because I&#x27;ve tried them all!</li>
    <li> Ok, the product is great EXCEPT that the damn thing is staining my sheets! And the really strange thing is that this black mask is staining my sheets brown (?) It took me a while to figure out what it was, but, sure enough, if I rub the mask against part of the sheet, a sort of liquid make-up brown comes off on it. I read a review placed earlier on this product where the purchaser had the same problem--she thought it was due to wearing a heavy moisturizer at night. Well, I don&#x27;t put anything on my face at night, and I certainly don&#x27;t go to bed with make-up on, but this otherwise wonderful sleep mask has ruined two pairs of sheets--the brown won&#x27;t come off. What seems strange to me is that this doesn&#x27;t seem to be happening to everyone (????)</li>
    <li> It was huge, yet still did not block all light, or even most of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did not block noise at all, either.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift and the person I bought it for has extreme vertigo.  He says it is absolutely the best mask he has every had.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my fiancee since she needs complete dark to sleep and works nights so has to sleep into the day. She said this was the most comfortable mask she ever owned. Loves it.</li>
    <li> This mask is comfortable and effective. No binding, slipping elastic straps, no pressure on the bridge of the nose or on the eyeballs like other masks I&#x27;ve tried. Blocks light well, and so comfortable I can forget I&#x27;m wearing it. I am online now to order my 2nd one because my first one mysteriously disappeared. I&#x27;ll probably find it in the bottom of the closet or something, but I&#x27;m tired of doing without, especially now that the sun has started coming up around 5am. I am glad to hear the previous problem with the dye has been fixed, though, as I did find dark streaks on my face when I used a moisturizer prior to wearing the mask.</li>
    <li> LOVE this. It is so soothing when I get an early morning headache, or my eyes feel puffy. I keep it in the freezer and it&#x27;s always ready to go! And, lest I forget, it is fantastic at blocking light. Sometimes I just don&#x27;t want to know when the sun rises, and my morning sleep is A LOT better when I wear this mask. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this thing. Much cheaper than buying heavy curtains to block out light in the bedroom. Plus it keeps her ears covered so acts as something of a sound dampener too.</li>
    <li> i have tried many different face masks over the past 20 years.  this is definately one of the best!  a little heavy, but comforting at the same time</li>
    <li> Having dealt with insomnia for 2+ decades, and having bought countless sleep masks, which last 4-6 weeks (elastic breaks quickly), I spotted this on Amazon. Awesome. Easily the best sleep mask I&#x27;ve used.  Nicely fitted around the nose. Covers my ears, which is great. I&#x27;ve used earplugs for 2+ decades, and have always dealt with them falling out, and now the mask keeps them in place. (my sleep regimen also includes a fan on high and a air filter running at max; 4 counter-clockwise circles, wag my tail, and retire).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Totally worth 25 bucks. Definitely will re-purchase.  Used it for the last 8 weeks or so - doesn&#x27;t show wear. Velcro still in good shape. Having found the ideal sleep mask, I was hesitant about washing it (certainly didn&#x27;t want to ruin it). I could&#x27;ve soaked it in the sink and gently cleaned, but I threw it in the washer with a full load and no problem. I&#x27;m a basic guy who doesn&#x27;t own anything that I can&#x27;t toss in the washer.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best!  I am buying another one for my husband.  Have tried all the others!</li>
    <li> Stains fabric from nature oil on face.  Otherwise, great for CPAP users.</li>
    <li> I agree with the others who said this mask slips around too much. If you roll around much when you&#x27;re sleeping, it will slip right off. Other than that, it is comfortable and works well, but I&#x27;ve stopped using mine because it comes off every time.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this mask one bit.  I have eyelash extensions and so with the description I thought I would give it a try because it said \\&quot;Amazingly light-weight, soft, cool satin fabric sleep mask, that is comfortable and breathable\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on and you have to strap it on tight to block out the light completely, which is not good for the eyelash extensions and also it interferes with REM.  By having it tight, it puts too much pressure on your eyes and so it&#x27;s not comfortable to try and sleep in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fabric is silk but the mask is heavy and so it heats your head up quickly, which makes it uncomfortable to sleep in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had sent an email requesting a refund by returning it and please be aware that they won&#x27;t refund your money if you have used it.  Also you need the original packaging to be able to put it back together.  They said if you open it to examine it they will accept the return however they charge the restocking fee of 15%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do return it without opening it, they will charge you a 15% restocking fee as well.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this mask.</li>
    <li> Tried many many masks, and this one is the keeper.  Ordering a second one since my first is getting ragged, but it&#x27;s held up for a couple years.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST sleep mask! It&#x27;s soft, easy to adjust with the Velcro tabs and pretty much blocks out all light!i HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
    <li> The mask arrived in terrific time. I love how the sleep mask feels and how it improves my sleeping during the day. I work the night shift and it has been hard for me to get enough sleep - now with this new sleep mask I believe I can catch the necessary ZZZzzz&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;I definitely would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> LAYS TOO FLAT AGAINST EYES</li>
    <li> Works great comfortable</li>
    <li> Very happy with product. Comfortable fit and no foam smell. Having some trouble keeping it on prone to slipping off and eat pads could be slightly longer.</li>
    <li> Received this mask last week, very happy about the quality and design. Its padded and keeps cool. No more tv light when the hubby stays awake!</li>
    <li> The basic premise of this mask is that it doubles as sound insulation. If you want to keep sound out get some earplugs. Hearos makes some good ones. The mask covers the ears with a fair amount of insulation, which is quite hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask initially blocks light well, but the lack of elastic on the back makes it very easy to dislodge it. The mask actually wraps all the way around the head and fastens with Velcro. Nice idea but not as effective as an elastic back. Other than that, it&#x27;s well made of nice and soft materials. It&#x27;s comfortable.</li>
    <li> Does not omit the sound as well as I would expect, you have to use ear plugs. Comfortable to wear and blocks out most light. Much more comfortable than other sleep masks.</li>
    <li> Simply amazing. Cuts down noise enough to sleep but not so far that it is dangerous. Light is GONE!! Will buy one of these every time!!!</li>
    <li> I like the tightness of the mask. It totally covers your eyes, and it blocks some sound as well. Sometimes I wake up with a little discomfort/pain in my outer ears, but it&#x27;s relatively minor. The mask does get a little dirty, so you might need to wash it pretty regularly if you&#x27;re concerned about sweat residue.</li>
    <li> An excellent product. I will never be without one again. I always would wake up when the sun came in the bedroom window, however  now with the mask it is impossible to know if the sun is shining or not. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I bought for my husband and he is using it every night now.  He reports it is comfortable and blocks lights out PERFECTLY!  The shape is just right and it is not heavy, while still being effective.  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> It looks a little sketchy when you get it. Basically a cushioned satin 5in wide 20inch long cloth with Velcro and a notch cut out for your nose. BUT it works like a champ! Super comfortable, stays put, blocks all light, stays cool even though it&#x27;s cushioned. I&#x27;ve been sleeping like a baby during the day after working 3rd shift and didn&#x27;t have to mount big black out curtains in my bedroom. Durable construction and quality Velcro fastener, looks like it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> This is the second sleep master sleep mask i have purchased.  I use it nightly - it does not leave the raccoon eye marks like other mask did for me..  so ~~  thank you ~</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different sleep masks.  This one is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this with little foam ear-plugs, and you&#x27;ll rest undisturbed -- even with inconsiderate neighbors.</li>
    <li> Seems to do as it claims. My only complaint is the fabric is starting to fray around my nose and cheek area. The result is tickling my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - Mask is unusable. Only had for about a month. The area that touches my nose and cheeks have so many frayed stitching. I trimmed away some of the fray but unbearable to wear.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the mask for over a week and decided to review it to help you.... I&#x27;m a very light sleeper, but my husband stays up reading, so I need an effective tool to block lamp light.  This one works great!!  The eye-lining is soft without being slick, and provides excellent light blockage without adding a lot of heat.  My previous eye mask had a felt eye liner, but the satin on this mask is much better.  I love how it wraps around the sides of my head, giving a partial sound barrier, as well.  The only thing I would change is making the back velcro clasp material thinner.  When I lay on my back, there is a slight bump from the closure.  But I&#x27;ve had no problems with it sliding off during sleep and really really like it.  I can&#x27;t wait to use it on an upcoming flight!  It&#x27;s sure to help me sleep there.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s thick and comfortable. The only draw-back is that it can come off your face when you&#x27;re sleeping if you move a lot.The important thing with this mask is that it helps me fall asleep. I have purchased several sleep masks and this is by far the best. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
    <li> This is my 4th eye mask. I thought I&#x27;d finally bite the bullet and purchase this one (most expensive by far of the four) because of the rave reviews.  I wear an eye mask not only to keep the light out, but also because I have very dry eyes (even with all of the ointment/drops I put in them) and sleep with a ceiling fan on and my eye doctor suggested I get an eye mask to keep the fan from drying my eyes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, when I wear this mask, my eyes are even more dry/scratchy in the morning than my other masks.  The material feels nice, but it&#x27;s hard for me to find a balance between too tight and not letting light in/feeling like my eyes aren&#x27;t \\&quot;breathing\\&quot;/there is just a lot of material touching my face, and too loose so that the mask comes off at night/light shines through when I move.. :/ I really wanted to love it and I wore it every night for a couple of weeks to give it a fair chance.  It would be a lot better if the part of the mask over the eyes was cupped to provide breathing room and to allow you to open your eyes freely without being hindered by the mask pressing against them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not that my other masks weren&#x27;t good (of the other 3, I still use 2), but I was looking for a combo of the two masks. One of them is cupped, but the material (foamy) is a bit harsh on my face and didn&#x27;t keep light out so well around the nose. The other was a great material and kept light out better, but often slipped off at night because of the velcro+elastic.  Not sure what I&#x27;m going to do with the mask now.. I&#x27;m sad I wasted $25 and don&#x27;t like it...  :/</li>
    <li> I can see why there are lots of great reviews for this one, it is a beautiful, well made product.  It didn&#x27;t work for me for two reasons...One, I can&#x27;t have something touching my eyelashes at night, it was disruptive.  Also, I sleep on a satin pillowcase, and the velcro that is exposed once I fit it will catch and pull on my pillowcase.  I can turn it inside out so the &amp;#34;hook&amp;#34; is by my hair, and then wake up with a rats nest on my hair.  So, I realize that I have very specific needs, and these issues may not be a problem for most users.  It was very soft, and very well made.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and will do business next time and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Best sleep mask ever.  Period.</li>
    <li> as long as I remember to put it on, I sleep great with it.  It came with earplugs, which I don&#x27;t use.  But, the mask goes over your ears, so it does block out some sound.  Very comfortable.</li>
    <li> REPOST:  My original review is below, but things have changed since then because the mask is stuffed with something or other that sticks out through the surface material after a while and becomes extremely irritating. The area around the nose and eyes is very sensitive, so even a single thread or the end of a feather in the wrong place can make it to annoying to use. I&#x27;m afraid that&#x27;s what happened to me. I had to throw both of mine away.   Terrific mask. Extremely comfortable and effective. I ended up getting a second one to keep in my travel things, so I&#x27;d be sure not to forget it when I went away.</li>
    <li> Working nights, sleeping days I&#x27;ve tried so many of these. This mask is THE BEST. It stays in place, doesn&#x27;t get tangled in my hair, adjusts easily and blocks light incredibly well!!! If a sleep mask is needed I would recommend only this one.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended!!  My husband and I both wear these masks every night and love them.  Have recently order replacements, as we have had ours for a couple years :)</li>
    <li> Comfortable and works perfect. Beats sleeping with a pillow over my head - and I stay cooler! I just wish it came in black. Very satisfied and I would recommend!</li>
    <li> I like this sleep mask since it covers both my eyes and my ears. I don&#x27;t find that it blocks out any noise though. Perhaps it muffles it a bit, but not significantly. Some light does get in through the bottom but I&#x27;ve never experienced a sleep mask that doesn&#x27;t. This is comfortable and pretty good quality - I think the price point is a little high for what it is, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find a good one elsewhere. I don&#x27;t really find the heat being an issue, but i haven&#x27;t used it in the summer yet. Overall, I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Made in USA! Durable and very comfortable. The earplugs are a plus. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are anything of an insomniac like me and hate any light getting into your eyes or annoying sounds from outside disrupting your sleep, this mask definitely fixes the problem! This mask is the best mask I&#x27;ve ever had and is well worth the price. It is not like the cheap masks where the bands fall apart and you can&#x27;t even wash them properly because they will fall apart or never dry. I love supporting companies who make their products in the USA and will buy another mask when mine eventually gives out someday. :)</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this sleep mask. I bought it so I could sleep on an upcoming flight to Europe. I tried it out the other night and had a restful sleep.</li>
    <li> When I decided to replace my old sleep mask I did some research and discovered Sleep Master was highly ranked. I was looking a new design without the elastic band getting tangled in my hair and one that didn&#x27;t shift during the night. I am so impressed with my purchase that I wanted to share my thoughts with my first product review. It&#x27;s a great product at a very reasonable price. I&#x27;m thrilled with my purchase.</li>
    <li> First let me start by saying that this mask is a lot better than the average sleep mask.  It just was not what I expected.  I was looking for a mask that would 100% block out light from a TV and muffle the TV sound.  My husband watches the TV to fall asleep and I need it above all dark.  This mask DID block out all of the TV light however it did not muffle the sound and fit strange. It comes with a set of ear plugs for a reason I felt like I could hear everything with it on. Also I have a large head and I felt like this mask is really large so if you are a petite person this mask may be large on you.  It is a good mask I just believe my exceptions were set very high based on the reviews I read before purchase.</li>
    <li> There are times I have to nap in the daylight hours.  Usually, I wind up putting a pillow over my head to help bar the sunlight that streams through the blinds.  Not anymore!  Love this sleep mask!  It&#x27;s soft and easy to wear and large enough to keep out slivers of light that come in around the edges of other masks. I particularly like that it doesn&#x27;t tangle in my hair.</li>
    <li> This is my second sleep master and I found it is the best so far.  I have been a nurse working nights for almost 20 years and have tried numerous masks. This is the only one that doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes when I wake up and keeps me totally in the dark!  I cannot give it five stars due to the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only owned the Sleep Master for two months but am quite happy with it. The Velcro closure is marvelous for adjusting fit and is easy to use before or after the mask is in place. Even with my relatively large male head the mask is comfortable and surprisingly not too warm to wear. As others have stated, the mask is lightweight and soft with a smooth satin finish. Although I&#x27;ve only had the product a relatively short period of time I&#x27;m confident its construction will insure a long life.</li>
    <li> I have tried many others and this is hands down the best eye cover I have ever acquired. Totally beats the competition</li>
    <li> I did not like the quality of this mask for the price I felt it looked cheap. Maybe I felt I could make this at home and attach some Velcro in the back. I returned the item.</li>
    <li> I am a night shift worker and was looking for a quality sleep mask to replace the worn out one I had with a thin band that went around your head that was ready to break. I like the comfort of the Sleep Master mask. It fits nicely keeps out the light and most importantly it stays in place whether I roll over or move when I am sleeping. The previous mask I had would slip sometimes and that problem does not exist anymore. For those of you looking for a sleep mask I would buy this one over again! I have been a night shift worker for 20 years now and this one by far is the best one I&#x27;ve used so far and gets a big AAA+ from me.</li>
    <li> I resisted buying one off these for ever, instead sticking to cheaper masks.  I was wrong.  It really blocks out all the light, unlike the Dream Essntials Sweet Dreams, which broke after not much use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this mask to be comfortable, easy to keep on, easy to adjust, just a pleasure.  I can turn any room into blackness once I slip this on.  For a guy that works nights like me, I think it&#x27;s fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I have found it a bit hot sometimes.  I don&#x27;t *love* the fabric on my eyelids, but it&#x27;s not a big deal either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy another.</li>
    <li> so soft and comfy, love the way it feels and fits perfect covering my eyes and ears.PERFECT .</li>
    <li> I am convinced these are the best eye shades and worth the extra cost. They are comfortable, they stay in place, and they totally block light. So far they hold up well in the wash, but I put them in a separate laundry bag. I&#x27;ve given two as gifts and the recipients LOVE them.</li>
    <li> functions really well. drowns out tv sound and light as well as being comfortable while doing it.</li>
    <li> A perfect companion for a night shift worker. Very comfortable on my eyes and face, and no light gets in.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other sleep masks and none have compared so far.  This mask covers more than the typical one, and it is comfortable, adjustable, and doesn&#x27;t let any light in at all.  I&#x27;m on my second one now, and will never buy any other one.</li>
    <li> I wear it if I want to try to take a nap.  Trying to wear it when I sleep, my brain keeps telling me...there is someone on your head etc....get the best sleep by hiding over the covers...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fab. Bought it and lost in a suitcase -- I&#x27;m buying a new one for some upcoming long flights.&lt;br /&gt;One design recommendation for women users -- I love this for sleeping on planes and also at night.&lt;br /&gt;But here&#x27;s the hitch: on planes I am wearing full makeup and at night I am wearing all kinds of potions to moisturize my face.&lt;br /&gt;It is silk, which instantly absorbs my creams into itself. My fix is to cut a piece of terrycloth to the inside shape and attach it with velcro. The terrycloth liner keeps my potions from running into the mask and I can rinse it out separately. Would be cool if they could incorporate this into the design.</li>
    <li> This is the best sleep mask I have owned from the perspective of light blocking but there is one issue. I wake up in the middle of the night with it off my face often. It goes over the ears so there is nothing to stop it from sliding if you move around in your sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than this a great product. I will probably never buy pharmacy sleep masks again.</li>
    <li> The sleep mask works even better than described by the seller.  It&#x27;s comfortable, soft, and worth every penny.  Even without the earplugs that come with the mask, the mask itself covers my ears.</li>
    <li> This works great for me as a person who works third shift. I kept waking up due to light exposure coming through my window curtains and was looking for a solution to this. Checked this product out as well as other reviews and this mask works as described. Keeps the light out and it really does muffler the sound too as it does wrap around your ear. The nose slit fits fine for me and the strap customizes around your head shape. I definitely recommend giving this a try!</li>
    <li> I guess I should have listened to the other reviewers.  There is a distinct smell and I typically get headaches for odd smells.  I couldn&#x27;t take the risk and returned the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to pick up a different brand at TJ Max that had room for REM sleep and it was 3.99</li>
    <li> I love this sleep mask. It&#x27;s not perfect but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found. I like that is soft and silky. I can change positions and go on my side and it just smushes into pillow without poking into my face. The silky texture feels good and relaxing. Love the width. Doesn&#x27;t pull hair. Doesn&#x27;t cover nose. Can&#x27;t sleep without it. Holds up after machine washing. Blocks a good deal of light. Does keep my hair down and doesn&#x27;t snag. Great for planes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside: not completely black out. But I don&#x27;t think you can have a silky sort of frameless and soft mask and have it be perfect. I just pull it down and adjust if light comes through.</li>
    <li> If you move while sleeping, the mask will slide off. The Dreamcatcher mask might be bulkier and hotter, but it is also more secure.</li>
    <li> Perfect, I could not ask for a better mask. The fact that it helps with sound is a huge plus!!! Would definitely buy another one!</li>
    <li> Works best with a smaller nose like most models have.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it anymore.  The mask is a little heavy and it makes my head sweat a lot, especially near the ears.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay put, which is really annoying, and it doesn&#x27;t provide any noise reduction as suggested in the description. It is very soft though and it does eliminate day light, but I wanted it to block noise so at the end, I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Never been able to wear sleep masks before, but that has changed a bit with these. I can&#x27;t wear them all night, but they do help me fall asleep if my partner is working in the bedroom or I am on a plane. Very comfortable, but my head gets a little warm in them over time.</li>
    <li> This sleep master  does not  block the noise as advertised. I think this is a total waste of money a</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my second sleep master, I lost my last one unfortunately. This mask is the best I ever tried, it&#x27;s soft, comfortable, light-prevent, and definitely a revolution of sleep mask. I recommended it to many friends, and they love it too.</li>
    <li> I love this sleep mask.  I have never been able to wear a sleep mask before, all the ones I&#x27;d tried were too uncomfortable.  This mask is very well made.  I knew as soon as I saw the package that the money was well spent.  I like that the whole mask goes around my ears and the strap in the back is very wide.  This makes it so the mask feels uniform around my head and doesn&#x27;t bother me regardless of what side I&#x27;m sleeping on.  Unlike other masks, sleeping on my side doesn&#x27;t push the mask uncomfortably or allow light in.  The face side of it is very large, no light at all gets in.  The padding of it makes it so that you can adjust it around your head and the padding gently rests on your eyelids, sealing out all light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was definitely hesitant to spend this much money for it, but I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
    <li> When I received this I was surprised at how thick it was but then when I put it on it didn&#x27;t feel thick at all and doesn&#x27;t bother me when I sleep at all.  How it fits around my ears is great also.  I live on a ranch and work night shift so I def need the help with sound.</li>
    <li> This mask does its job and keeps the light out. It does not block a lot of sound but I expected that. Comfortable and easy to keep on throughout the night</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading an article on ways to get a better nights sleep and I LOVE it! Really does help keep all the extra light out and it&#x27;s comfy:) two of my friends have tried after my recommendation and they love it too. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s thick and padded and soft.  It does slip around a bit, but that can&#x27;t be helped.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Moderate weight, soft, very large eye/face coverage.  The head strap is an extension of the eye mask and binds with velcro.  Very comfortable and no pressure points.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Excellent. Item as described. Easy to use. Stays in place. Also, partially blocks out sound for good nights sleep. Arrived on time. Would use this company again. Thanks.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above is the sincere but \\&quot;knee jerk\\&quot; review I dashed out when contacted by Sleep Master. It is an incomplete review as I did not want to take more time. However, after posting, I had a chance to read what others were saying about this product -  and about their criteria for a good sleep. The two biggest complaints were 1) eye areas not contoured enough and therefore interferes with REM sleep (eye movements during sleep) and 2) that this mask did not block sound very well. Like many of you, I am sensitive to light and noise and have tried many different sleep masks through the years (the worst being the cheap masks you get from airlines when on a long distance flight).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact is that no single product can provide protection for REM sleep and block 100% of the light and noise. Therefore, I use the &#x27;Sleep Master&#x27; in combination with two other products. I first put on a contoured sleep mask to achieve protection for REM sleep. I use the &#x27;[[ASIN:B000CCI4YU Dream Essentials Sweet Dreams Contoured Sleep Mask]]&#x27; but use whatever works best for you. I then put in place my ear plugs. I use the the &#x27;[[ASIN:B000R8Y1Y6 Hearos Ultimate Softness Series Ear Plugs]]&#x27; but again use any plugs that you prefer. Lastly, I wrap the &#x27;Sleep Master Mask&#x27; around (over top of) the contoured mask and ear plugs. The &#x27;Sleep Master&#x27; is great as the outer layer as it is smooth and flat. This is important to me as I turn from side to side when sleeping and tend to loose or dislodge most masks and ear plugs. Because the &#x27;Sleep Master&#x27; fits over the fairly rigid &#x27;Sweet Dreams Contoured Mask&#x27;, I can pull it tight enough to stay securely put while not placing pressure directly upon my eyes and adversely effecting REM sleep. It also keeps me from losing my ear plugs. The &#x27;Sleep Master&#x27; provides me an &#x27;additional&#x27; layer for blocking both light and sound. This may sound cumbersome but once in place it is the most comfortable and effective solution I have found. Does this solution block 100% of light and sound. No. But then again nothing will. Occasionally, a very small speck of light may get through and sound is still barely detectable but very muted and seems far away (for those of you extremely light sleepers you may want to add a white noise machine to the mix). The bottom line is use what ever &#x27;combination&#x27; works for you. For now, the &#x27;Sleep Master&#x27; is the perfect and indispensable outer layer to my own solution and I recommend it highly. A comment to Sleep Master - If you could incorporate a more rigid contour mask into the inner layer of the Sleep Master Mask then this layered approach might be unnecessary.</li>
    <li> If not for the tip of a feather sticking out  in the wrong place I would give this a 5 star all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is soft and covers enough to darken most any room. I really like it except for that darn feather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better than anything else I tried and close to perfect. If the feather moves away I may update to 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping that it would drown out a lot more sound than it did, but did not meet my expectations in that category. To boot, it came with a pair of disposable ear plugs. It&#x27;s pretty comfortable though.</li>
    <li> Kinda bulky and you don&#x27;t really get full darkness because of its loose fit</li>
    <li> I am a picky, high-maintenance sleeper. The room has to be pitch black, all alarm clock lights and computer power indicator lights and smoke alarm indicator lights covered up, white noise via a fan, a very gentle breeze, and a room temperature of anywhere from 68-76 (depending on the time of year). Bought this sleep mask because I married a TV watcher, you know, the kind of girl who likes to fall asleep while watching TV. Anyway, the handful of times I&#x27;ve tried using this attempting to fall asleep with these outside distractions, I failed miserably. I either had to grin and bear it or throw a temper tantrum and upset my wife. I love her to death, but I really don&#x27;t love sleeping masks. That being said, this is probably one of the better ones you can buy, provided you know how to fall asleep with a mask wrapped around your face. Maybe one day I will be an expert sleep mask sleeper guy, but until then, this thing doesn&#x27;t really work for me. But at least it&#x27;s soft and cushy on my face. Oh and one more thing, you can still see through the nose curvature, a tiny splinter of outside light still gets through even though it&#x27;s very faint. If you&#x27;re reading this and thinking I&#x27;m a little crazy, you may be right, but I honestly don&#x27;t care.</li>
    <li> I have had this mask for about a year now and I still love it! I recently bought one for my son-in-law and he loves it too. It is light weight, adjustable, super comfortable and stays cool through out the night. I plan on getting more of them for gifts. The only problem I have with this mask is that, every time I use it, I sleep so hard I don&#x27;t want to get out of bed.</li>
    <li> The mask was delivered a week before the expected date. So far it is a great sleep mask. No light leaks. Slight muffling of noises because of the way it is designed. No heavy pressure on the eyeballs. It works as described. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I assumed the large size of the mask would block the light better than my smaller ones but it doesn&#x27;t really. I think it needs to be thicker and have a black terrycloth lining on the face side. The terrycloth would be cooler on my skin and also block more of the light and also produce a non-sliding surface as the mask does slide around on the skin.</li>
    <li> The material is very soft and breathable, easy to sleep with. The only problem I have is that my head is rather large and my nose sticks out just a little too much. I bought this to sleep during the day time as I was on night shift and it just doesn&#x27;t seat correctly on my face and I still see light around my nose. If I push it down so the light doesn&#x27;t come in, then it presses on my nose too hard to be comfortable.</li>
    <li> The mask is precisely as described and very functional. If you need a sleep mask and use one regularly, it makes sense to spend the extra money for a better, more comfortable fit. You pay more for this sleep mask, but it&#x27;s better designed and more generous with the material.</li>
    <li> This is like my 5th sleep mask. All previous ones do not block the light completely and most are uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the most comfortable mask I have ever tried and it blocks 98+% of the light - which is what I bought it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some complaints that it is not sound proof. It comes with some ear plugs and you can buy better ones if you need that. The ad states &amp;#34;The ear area is padded for sound muffling&amp;#34; ... &amp;#34;ELIMINATES LIGHT and REDUCES SOUND&amp;#34;. I do not know of ANY sleep mask that will eliminate sound. I really wish they had left off the sound part of the ad. Yes, with the earplugs in it reduces sound (about as much as the earplugs do) and I imagine that if tested it would show that the number of decibels that reach the ear is reduced even with just the mask - just not really noticeable.</li>
    <li> Well designed and very comfortable. Very useful for sleeping in planes and in hotel rooms when changing time zones. Very comfortable for a quick power nap in office as well!</li>
    <li> Great Item, Blocks most light and is comfortable and exactly as described. I like that it covers my ears. I find hand washing it works fine. The size and length are perfect. The mask can get hot in summer without a fan on you, My only problem with it is the material frays ever so slightly that little threads tickle my face and i need to trim them off. Overall definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this every night since I received it. I can achieve total darkness with this sleep mask. It is very comfortable and silky soft.</li>
    <li> I have had years of sleep problems and tried several types of sleep mask products.  For my birthday last year, I was given one of the Sleepmaster masks ...and it is AMAZING! So comfortable, so light, so flexible.  Of all the sleep masks I&#x27;ve tried, it is by far the best in overall comfort, increased ability to fall asleep, a soft reduction of ambient noise and durability.  I plan to give them for Christmas gifts to my friends.</li>
    <li> I bought this mask as a gift for my mother. She loves it! She says that it&#x27;s very comfortable and not tight anywhere! She has to sleep during the day and wearing this mask has made it so much easier for her to fall asleep.</li>
    <li> I really like this mask. It is super soft and really shuts out the light.  It was quite nice to receive the earplugs with it...I definitely slept longer and deeper with it, and that was with all the added stress of getting married and staying in a very noisy house.  Would definitely purchase again. The only thing that is not perfect is that sometimes the overlapping velcro in the back makes it hard to sleep on your back, with a lump under your head, but I generally get used to that and it doesn&#x27;t prevent sleep.</li>
    <li> Soft, can wear it all night long, and keeps the light out. The fabric around the nose area is shaped so it settles on your face so no light can get in.</li>
    <li> This may be the best product for some. Not for me tho. Too hot. Comes off. Giving it to a client. Oh well.</li>
    <li> really like it its not to tight but usually stays on, i have woke up with it off but i got to sleep and stayed asleep so that was ok with me.  what i love is that it covers my ears....i used to sleep with one of my daughters stuffed animals on my head, laying on my side with the body on my ear the legs around my neck and the arms over my eyes! LOL This has take the place of the silly panda! ha love it!</li>
    <li> I spent quite a bit for this top of the line beauty, but consider the value of a great night&#x27;s sleep!  You will love this mask because it&#x27;s so comfortable, soft, and silky.  An&lt;br /&gt;added attraction concerns the Velcro fastener in the back.  What an ingenious idea.  The size is just perfect because it&lt;br /&gt;allows no light to filter through.  My husband likes to sleep&lt;br /&gt;with the light on so he doesn&#x27;t stumble in the night.  I couldn&#x27;t sleep before so this was just perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried about 5 different sleep masks, and this one is my hands-down favorite. I find it extremely comfortable. The large, enveloping size makes it effective at blocking out light, and, at least for me, much less likely to slide off or, say have a strap get caught in an uncomfortable position behind my ear (there are no straps with this one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only caveat is that I don&#x27;t think anyone should buy this for noise suppression. The effect is pretty subtle -- it&#x27;s what you&#x27;d experience by yawning. I simply consider the slight muffling a nice bonus.</li>
    <li> This is an okay mask but I don&#x27;t like that it blocks my ears.  The silk does make it comfortable but I like my Bucky much better!</li>
    <li> This mask has a very silky feel, is padded and very comfortable. Its large size works very well in keeping out light. The Velcro closure in the back works so much better than the type with elastic bands. I am so pleased with this sleep mask that I ordered one to give as a gift.</li>
    <li> NOTE:  I am changing my review from 2 stars to 4.  I know, I&#x27;m surprised myself, too.  My original review is below, but I&#x27;ve found over time that I&#x27;ve grown to like this mask.  Specifically, I love the soft silkiness of the fabric, and I&#x27;ve settled on a not-too-tight but not-too-loose way of closing the velcro such that it doesn&#x27;t push in on my eyes too much, yet still stays mostly in place, with just a bit of light coming through around the nose area.  I still find it to be not possible to sleep on my back using this mask, so I&#x27;ve made a point to only sleep on my side when I wear it.  This has not been as big of an issues as it at first seemed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;This is a decent sleep mask, with some major flaws, and some serious over-hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- the material feels very nice&lt;br /&gt;- it is thicker, and does a decent job blocking out light if worn tightly (though see below)&lt;br /&gt;- it has velcro in the back, so you can adjust the tightness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- If you&#x27;re a back sleeper, forget it - the velcro is so thick that it will feel bumpy on the back of your head;  I&#x27;ve tried positioning the closure up higher on my head as well as lower, and it&#x27;s just not comfortable&lt;br /&gt;- The ear coverage does absolutely nothing for dampening sound - that&#x27;s just marketing gibberish (which would still leave this a fine mask, if it weren&#x27;t for the other issues)&lt;br /&gt;- I found that in order to get the mask on tightly enough to fully block out light around my nose area I had to tighten the velcro to be quite snug.  The problem with that is that the velcro itself is positioned exactly in the area where your eyes are.  What that means is that in order to tighten the mask, the most pressure is applied directly to your eyes.  I think this issues could be alleviated if they had two strips of velcro, one above and one below, so that the main tightening could be on other - less delicate - areas of the face.  For me, if I tighten the mask enough to block out light, myeyes feel the pressure and my vision is blurry and uncomfortable by morning.  Not good!&lt;br /&gt;- The price just isn&#x27;t justified - I had just as much eye coverage with none of the back-of-the-head velcro issues with masks less than half the price</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed with this item... I absolutely can see through the opening at my nose, it does not block out light from underneath. I wore this on an airplane, and this mask is not the nicest one either, I felt a little silly. The guy next to me had a regular mask, but not those free kinds you get on the airline, and I kept thinking his was superior to mine. Although when I purchased this I thought I would have the &#x27;ultimate&#x27; mask, incomparable and best. Not at all...</li>
    <li> This is the best sleep mask I have ever had. It is so soft and doesn&#x27;t apply any pressure on my eyes. Not only does it block out all of the light it goes over your ears and eliminates some of the sounds. The velcro closure is sturdy vs the elastic straps on most sleep masks. Once I put it on it stays in place.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing. It&#x27;s very soft and comfortable and doesn&#x27;t interfere with my getting to sleep at all. My job requires me to sleep at odd times, and this thing makes it pitch dark at any time of day. I never leave home overnight without it!</li>
    <li> 3/5 stars. Above average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top rated review here on amazon seems extremely defensive of this sleep mask and a bit cynical and patronizing towards people who this sleep mask clearly doesn&#x27;t work for, a little odd and rude of them to be. The truth of the matter is is that a sleep mask is a very personal choice and depends on the shape of a persons head/nose and what may work for one may not work for another. In the same way a body soap may work for someone but that may also irritate another persons skin, it&#x27;s a personal thing. In my review here I&#x27;ve tried to look at this from not just how it works for me but how it works for the broader spectrum of people. Please don&#x27;t listen to reviews that slam people whose reviews differ from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am one who needs pitch black to sleep and as it has been shown it is much healthier to sleep in complete darkness a functional and comfortable sleep mask is ideal. Especially when rays of sunlight come through in the early morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came to amazon knowing they would have a wide selection and this one seemed to be the holy grail of sleep masks yet the reviews seem divided so I will try to hit on the important points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The mask is very wide which is important to block light out. However the nose slot may or may not fit someones nose. The photo showing the sleep mask on the woman fits her so perfectly in every way (nose, forehead, head size) it would be nice if everyone&#x27;s face was so perfectly proportioned but that is not the case. For me this doesn&#x27;t block out all the light but does block most and I haven&#x27;t found one that blocks all light. Depending on how this fits your nose/forehead it may block out more or less light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The mask does not have an elastic but instead wraps around and overlaps and Velcros. It is wide all the way around and barely narrows at all (it does not narrow nearly as much as the second two photos seem to show), it is also padded all the way around. This makes for a very thick band at the back of your head. If you sleep on your back, like I do this may bother you. Even if you push the back of it down toward your neck it is still in the way. However it is very gentle against your head and unlike many elastic ones it does not hurt the top of your ears, it is also easier to adjust than most elastic ones. If you have a very very large head this may not fit you or wrap all the way around. I have a medium sized head and it fits me fine (and has about 6 inches of excess).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The sleep mask is basically firm but gentle foam covered in satin. The foam is gentle against my eyes but I don&#x27;t wrap it too tight (read on as to why this might be a problem). It is very soft and I have not had any problems with it bleeding in the laundry or on my pillow. I wash it on gentle cycle (in a lingerie bag) in cooler water and hang it to dry. You could hand wash it if you wanted but whatever you do don&#x27;t put it in the dryer. The velcro has held up and the mask is durable and well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I sleep in a cool environment and live in a generally non-humid climate and prefer to bundle up in blankets in the winter than crank the heat up. I also don&#x27;t sweat easily and really need to be working out. I sleep with my head exposed but this sleep mask makes me sweat. Which really surprised me. Satin isn&#x27;t breathable AT ALL. The sleep mask isn&#x27;t breathable and is so wide covering so much of your face that it makes me sweat and I assume this may happen to others. I wish it was made out of some more breathable but the satin is very soft (read on).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The satin is very slippery and as it is so wide all the way around and never narrows to hug your head the sleep masks moves everywhere when I sleep. I toss and turn in my sleep (which some people stay still) and the satin just slips and moves all over my head with nothing to prevent it. I have woken up with the back of it over my eyes or with it completely off my head on my pillow. If you try to tighten it enough to keep it from moving it will put pressure on your eyes which you may wake up with a headache and your eyes very irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. The cost. The item is well made and not cheap or going to fall apart. It also isn&#x27;t made in China but in the US. It will last a lifetime and washes up nicely. If the sleep mask works for you then it is worth the price for a goodnight sleep. If it doesn&#x27;t then it is a waste of $25 but amazon is very good with returns. I recommend you wear it every day for at least three weeks before judging it to allow yourself to get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note this doesn&#x27;t block sound. That is just silly. It&#x27;s a sleep mask, invest in quality earplugs (try Hearos).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall if you have a very very large head or differently shaped nose this may not work for you. If you sweat easily or sleep in a hot/humid environment this may not work for you. If you move around or toss and turn in your sleep this may not work for you. In the end it just comes down to what works for you. If you have tried other sleep masks and they are not working out then this may definitely be worth at least a try. If you have never had/worn a sleep mask before and are just starting out I would recommend you first try the basic banana shaped sleep mask and go from there. 3/5 stars. Definitely not a universal sleep mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to do a slight update. I was recently reading FAQs and other information on the companies own site and I have to clear up a few things for those who are reading that as well. If you buy this mask please do not replace it once a year, the company just wants your money and there is no reason to do that as it does not wear out like that. This item does not solve bed head in any way or \\&quot;keep a ladies hair in place\\&quot;, due to the rubbing from the back of the mask your hair will probably look worse in the morning than it would without the mask. Lastly, but very importantly (please read) this mask does NOT reduce noise. In reading their website I am shocked at how much they put forward the noise reduction to the extent that they say it might be a safety concern that you can barely hear! This is laughable! Cloth covering part of your ear is not going to reduce noise at all. They even say \\&quot;If you choose to use these ear plugs with Sleep Master, please be careful because you will not hear anything\\&quot;. This may be true but it would be entirely because of your choice of earplugs NOT the sleep mask. They also say wonderful things about the complementary ear plugs provided, the ear plugs provided are not great. As I mentioned earlier if you are looking for total sound blockage try Hearos.llow. If you try to tighten it enough to keep it from moving it will put pressure on your eyes which you may wake up with a headache and your eyes very irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. The cost.

    <li> I found this mask very comfortable, as you can sleep in any position and it is soft and doesn&#x27;t move around too much since it goes all around your head.  If you want to close out the light more, you have to fasten it snugger, which isn&#x27;t always the most comfortable.  You must wear it a little looser so it doesn&#x27;t rub up against your eyes.  I found it comfortable to wear in the cool weather.  But I live in Phoenix, AZ, and I have worn it in some warmer nights (even with AC, it still is warmer) and then it isn&#x27;t quite as comfortable.  Then I would wear another mask which is less enclosed.  I agree with others that it doesn&#x27;t do much to keep the sound out, even though it goes around your ears.</li>
    <li> Fantastic sleep mask, comfortable, blocks out light wonderfully. The claim that it blocks sound is just not true, or barely so, but that&#x27;s what ear plugs are for.</li>
    <li> Description said it muffles sound significantly. I don&#x27;t notice any difference at all. It came with earplugs.  that&#x27;s exactly the reason I got it - I can&#x27;t sleep with earplugs. I thought this would help the noise without them.  I wish I had read the reviews first, but I fell for the ads. I can get an eye mask for less that 25.  What a disappointment.</li>
    <li> Best investment I have ever made thank you!</li>
    <li> At last, one that does not let a sliver of light in. Totally dark.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a friend. I use it every night and occasionally when I sleep in the car or on an airplane. Its the best one there is for the price imo.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE the Sleep Master! It’s a great product! I am able to sleep comfortably on nights when my husband decides he just can’t put his book down and has all the bedroom lights on.  I highly recommend everyone to try it, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> It moves around and dont stay put. For someone that toss, turn or sleep on side not recommended. I like smaller one where i can tie hair in between to keep ir still</li>
    <li> This is a great eye mask with good coverage.  It&#x27;s thicker than most other sleep masks, so it really does the trick.  The velcro seal is perfect and provides a good tight fit as opposed to the sleep masks with elastic straps which inevitably get stretched out.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very good product! Look forward to using it on my next flight.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many uncomfortable or ineffective sleep masks that when I found this one, it felt like love! Someone named Judy wrote on Amazon that they had \\&quot;mold allergies\\&quot; to this product. I&#x27;m SUCH an allergy person that I once considered having my sinuses surgically removed, and would have if someone who&#x27;d done that hadn&#x27;t dissuaded me. Anyway, I can&#x27;t believe Judy&#x27;s experience wasn&#x27;t a coincidence, because I, my son, and many other allergy sufferers love this mask.(I can tell if a house has mold in it within minutes because my throat and nasal passages seem to swell and my voice gets husky and I have to take benadryl and get out FAST. So I&#x27;m sure this mask does not have that problem.)     It&#x27;s expensive compared to the crummy ones, of course. But it feels lovely, and looks lovely, too. Great present, btw. I&#x27;ve given many to friends including allergy-sufferers like me. I give them as general presents, hostess gifts, stocking stuffers -- and as a gift to anyone I visit in a hospital. (Hospitals seem to specialize in keeping their patients awake.)    Good luck, all my fellow poor sleepers and allergy sufferers. I hope you&#x27;ll be helped by this mask,too.</li>
    <li> but others won&#x27;t as it is too bulky    The strap is bad too      Any good sleep mask should have two thin straps</li>
    <li> I am a long-time user of this product.  I just purchased another Sleep Master, as I lost my other one recently while traveling.  I use it all the time, so my first night without it I couldn&#x27;t sleep! It was as though something was missing!!  The Company rushed another to me right away.  I love the way this mask blocks the light and covers my ears at the same time. It even helps with the sounds of my hubby&#x27;s snoring!  It&#x27;s so comfortable and soothing that it seems to be part of me while I sleep. I wear this on a bright sunny day and take a nap with no problem!!             I also want other users to know that before I started using Sleep Master I had very dry eyes when I slept.  I went to the optometrist and he prescribed ointments and eye drops, but they never helped.  So, I ordered the Sleep Master sleep mask to see if that might help, and my dry eyes are a thing of the past!  I never experienced that with other masks or sleep aids.  This mask is special and somehow different from all the rest.  I was so amazed and delighted that I told my optometrist about it so he could recommend the sleep mask to his other patients.</li>
    <li> This was a perfect gift for my wife. She loves it. I didn&#x27;t realize that some people have eyelid coverings that are so thin that even the smallest amount of light can wake them up. This solved that problem.</li>
    <li> I have owned this mask for over 5 years.  I bought one when I realized that I could not sleep while my husband was watching television (I&#x27;m a very picky sleeper).  Through the years this mask has proven to be a lifesaver.  There are many days that I wake up, peek out from under my mask and realize that it&#x27;s broad daylight outside and I had no idea.    Here&#x27;s what I love about this mask:  - It is soft and comfortable; once you get used to it you don&#x27;t even realize it&#x27;s on.  - It doesn&#x27;t mess up your hair too badly.  - I like that it covers my ears too, it makes it more comfortable and blocks out some noise.  - It has held up well.  - The velcro makes it possible to get it on nice and tight.    The only cons I can note are:  - After awhile the \\&quot;stuffing\\&quot; seems to shift/thin a bit away from the front of the mask.  - At times the fabric which is cut out on the nose will cut into my nose if I don&#x27;t have it on \\&quot;just right\\&quot;.    I am in the process of ordering 5 more of these so I can be sure to have one in my travel bag, one at the Lake, and one at the office.  I also plan to give one to my Mom.    Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome sleep mask and works very well for blocking light while being comfortable to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be a 5 star review if they didn’t use the deceptive words in the product review of “REDUCES SOUND”.  While it’s probably technically true that a “some” sound is reduced, it’s not noticeable. Just think about it, this is a fabric over your ear, how much sound could be reduced?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That aside, as a sleep mask to block light, this works beautifully.  It’s comfortable to wear and easy to travel with.  I do a lot of long haul international flights in business class and gave up using the eye shades in the amenity kits and use this mask 100% of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cover does not remove for cleaning, but I placed mine in the washing machine on gentile and then hung dry and all is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommended this product 100%.  I just wish the company would remove the claims of reducing sound.</li>
    <li> They eliminate the light very well but are extremely warm to wear.</li>
    <li> It blocks somewhat more light out than other blindfolds, but is still not completely dark.  Also, it&#x27;s also annoyingly confining around the ears.</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;m not quite sure what is revolutionary enough about this to patent.      It&#x27;s basically a thick padded bit of comfy fabric with some velcro on it.  So sure, it keeps the light out, and I guess since it has to cover your ears some to get round your head then it does cut down a little on noise, but the net result is like having a thumping great nappy stuck on your head!  It&#x27;s thick, so it&#x27;s noticeable when lying on it, and it keep sliding off while you&#x27;re asleep.  I laughed out loud when I opened it and found the little pack of ear-plugs - yep, they&#x27;d help keep things quiet too, I suppose.    No question, if I&#x27;d been looking at this in a store, and able to handle it and try it before purchase, I would not bother.  I hadn&#x27;t invested my whole sense of well-being and happiness in this, so I won&#x27;t say I&#x27;m disappointed, but I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s worth the money.  Frankly, I wouldn&#x27;t pick this if it was free.  One of those silly little masks they used to give you on airlines does the job just as well if not better.</li>
    <li> Restful sleep had become an unknown experience in my life.  Due to a challenging career and changing physical conditions it seemed like a good night&#x27;s sleep was a thing of the past.  A concerned friend recommended the SLEEP MASTER and what a difference it made in my life!  It is comfortable and effective.  The company response was great and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.      I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has difficulty sleeping, travels frequently or would just like a good restful night of sleep.  (Who couldn&#x27;t use that?!?!)</li>
    <li> Works great as far as blocking light and sound. I give it a 3 because the mask is really slippery, because of the material.  I wake up and it is completely off.</li>
    <li> The version I got is different than the picture. Instead of a wide strap in the back, the material continues all the way around and connects together using velcro. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with this, except it mean the mask is extremely large and bulky. It stays on reasonably well, but not as well as some reviewers described. Also, it doesn&#x27;t seem to block as much light as I hoped. it is far better than most smaller masks, but not necessarily as good as ones with eye cups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for about a month before leaving this review, and I travel frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is solid on comfort, but the design change adds bulk and I suspect makes it slip off easier.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is great for infrequent napping, but if you are looking for something to use every night, I&#x27;d get one of the masks that have a raised area over the eyes. I used this mask for a few months and my eyelashes started to grow towards my nose. Not a good look. I bought a mask with a raised area over the eyes and the lashes are starting to correct. Not completely yet, but I am hopeful.  :)</li>
    <li> This is the second sleep mask I ordered from this seller. I liked the previous one so much that I recommended it to my husband. We are both extremely pleased; this is the best sleep mask I have used! The adjustable velcro closure allows for a perfect fit. It is very comfortable and totally blocks out the light. It also washes well. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was leery at first to get this since it&#x27;s shaped a little different.  But WOW.  It&#x27;s so incredibly soft.  And I actually sleep better now then I did with my old one.  And I love that it&#x27;s adjustable so it can fit anyone.</li>
    <li> At first I liked this mask but I have finally gotten tired of keeping it around as clutter and thrown it away. The silky fabric is nice, but I had the following problems:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The design means that when you lie on your side, you are lying on the mask itself. It&#x27;s a slippery fabric, so when you move your head the mask can slip out of position. Anyway the ear coverage doesn&#x27;t work as well to block sound as earplugs, so that aspect of the design did not turn out to be a good tradeoff for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The mask is essentially a huge long padded strip with a nose cutout. Even folded in half, it takes up too much space for convenient storage. Forget traveling with it. The product photo makes it look thinner and less awkward than I found it to be in real life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find I prefer the simple lightweight ones with the elastic around the ears. To each their own!</li>
    <li> Best sleep mask ever, at least for me. When adjusted properly, with the back down close to the base of your head, it completely blocks light, it is comfortable for extended periods while sleeping in any position, and it stays in place even when I roll around in my sleep. It is the only actual sleep mask I have found, as opposed to a nap mask. Yes, it&#x27;s bulky, and for that reason I use a more compact mask for overnight flights. And yes, it covers your ears and sort of hugs your head. I find that soothing but others might find it constraining. It does contact your eyelids, but just very gently and not to the degree that it interferes with REM. So it might not be for everyone, but I really like this mask and use it in preference to all my others.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these here on Amazon.  It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;mediocre&amp;#34; product at best. It either fits too tight or too loose. In addition to that it&#x27;s relatively expensive for a piece of thinly stuffed fabric. I seem to have misplaced it and haven&#x27;t found it in many weeks, but I don&#x27;t even miss it and haven&#x27;t really looked all that hard to find it... so what does that tell you?</li>
    <li> Really didn&#x27;t block out lite completely</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a physician who works about 20-25 night shifts per year. Restful sleep in a dark cool room during the daytime is crucial for me. I tried 2 sleep masks from Amazon: &amp;#34;Dream Essentials Sweet Dreams Contoured Sleep Mask with Earplugs and Carry Pouch, Black by Dream Essentials&amp;#34; (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CCI4YU/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o00_s00_i01?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1) and &amp;#34;Revolutionary, Patented SLEEP MASTER Sleep Mask by Sleep Master&amp;#34; (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015NZ6FK/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1). I sleep on my side 90% of the time and flat on my back 10% of the time. During the day my bedroom is silent (I never used the included the ear plugs with both sleep masks), but light still seeps through the closed windows/shutter blinds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dream Essentials sleep mask is cheaper ($9.95), but I found it to be uncomfortable. This sleep mask easily shifted around my face while I was sleeping. The lower part of the mask would cut into my nose and face after wearing it less than 1 hour. The band that goes around the back of the head is thin and cheaply made, it also started cutting into my ears. The amount of light that seeped in under the bridge of the nose was a bit too much for me, but others might find it acceptable. The only positive was being able to open my eyes while wearing this sleep mask. The Dream Essentials sleep mask was returned to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sleep Master sleep mask costs more ($25.90), but it&#x27;s money well spent on a comfortable sleep mask. This sleep mask is made of quality soft material and it did not shift around my face while sleeping. The amount of light that seeped in under the bridge of the nose was minimal (if at all), a huge plus since it created almost complete darkness. It&#x27;s difficult to open your eyes while wearing this mask, not a problem for me, but a plus or minus for others. Given the thickness of this sleep mask, expect it to generate more heat than other sleep masks. I&#x27;m keeping the TheSleep Master sleep mask for now, but I&#x27;ll update my review if anything negative arises.</li>
    <li> Great sleeping mask for sleeping in broad daylight.</li>
    <li> The most comfortable eye mask ever! This one stays put yet slides beautifully over pillowcases so that no matter what position you&#x27;re in, it provides continued darkness. Since it is a wide silky band all around, you don&#x27;t have a bothersome strap above the ear. After ordering one of these for a gift, and getting raves about it from the recipient, I ordered another for myself. I highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Not all what I expected after reading all the reviews. Falls off while sleeping, and creates some pressure on the eyes</li>
    <li> My husband uses this every night and he loves it.</li>
    <li> Super comfortable! Doesn&#x27;t bother me to sleep with it on and I&#x27;m a light sleeper. It blocks any light. I successfully used it on an overnight flight.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help me sleep when my son was born, since I had to return to work and my wife would be turning the lights on to breastfeed our son. For this purpose it was good. The sound being muffled just a tiny bit helped a little, but it is not significant. It did come with some earplugs though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Soft, feels good against skin, blacks out all light, no weird smells, very nice construction quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Because the velcro attachment is in a direct line behind the head (even with the eyes), tightening it enough so it doesn&#x27;t slip back and forth when I move my head on my pillow to get comfortable causes the front of the mask to feel tight against my eyes. The first night I used it this tight I felt very tired the next day as if I had only slept 2-3 hours instead of 7. After this, loosening it and dealing with it sliding around a bit while getting comfortable helped me feel more rested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this mask had a recessed area for the eyes it would be an easy 5 stars, since I could then tighten it so it wouldn&#x27;t slip on my head without feeling like my eyes were being pressed by the mask. I have thought that I might be able to glue some large plastic spoons where the eyes are or something, but I am not ready to ruin the mask for an experiment like that. Maybe someone else will find a better idea...</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and really well designed eye mask.  Keeps the light out, I recommend this eye mask worth the money.</li>
    <li> comfortable.  a little warm, though.</li>
    <li> This is the worst sleep mask I have ever had.  It is just a blindfold.  Nothing Revolutionary about this at all.  The 5 star reviews must be fake.  Someone said it nearly blocks out all noise, huh?  The earplugs will block out most noise, the mask is doing nothing.  The material, and design make your head hot very quickly.  Why is the back of the mask padded?  It makes it uncomfortable.  Mind you the padding is not thick by any means, but it is still noticeable for me.  The number one thing that I hated about this mask was that the mask pressed against my eyes.  That is extremely uncomfortable.  And the price, oh no, this is not even remotely worth that amount.  One size does not fit all, if you have a little tiny nose, your probably OK, I don&#x27;t fit that bill.  A few of the 5 star reviews may be real, but a vast majority must be fake, absolutely no way so many people would give this overpriced blindfold 5 stars.  I searched the patent, and it is laughable, though it does exist, so that much is true.</li>
    <li> This is super expensive but worth every penny. Material is extremely comfy. Doesnt stress on your eyes. There is no unevenness when you roll over. It perfectly holds your head. If you are a &amp;#34;No Lights&amp;#34; person. This is highly recommended. Not a ray can surpass this sheath of material.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all styles of sleepmasks -- those with raised eye sockets and those that fit flat across the eyes, and all had some kind of elastic band across the back to adjust to your head size.  I even tried one that had little elastic bands to fit around your ears!  None of these were satisfactory in that unless the elastic is tight, it&#x27;ll slip and slide and that can prove uncomfortable. It will eventually stretch out of shape, anyway. In addition, the size of the mask, itself, is often too small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many years ago I discovered that I could just lay a dark cloth across my eyes, and that \\&quot;sort of\\&quot; solved the problem.  But then, I found this wrap-around sleep mask which, I believe, is the ultimate solution.  The material is soft, easily washable and wraps comfortably around your head.  You position it over your nose, then adjust the fit with convenient velcro fasteners in back.  Once you have it like you want it, no amount of light \\&quot;seeps\\&quot; in. By comfortably blocking out light, you are pretty much ensured a good rest whether it&#x27;s in bed, a chair or on a plane.  I can&#x27;t recommend this mask highly enough!</li>
    <li> I tried it directly the day I got it, but I couldn&#x27;t keep it on for a long time (10-15 minute). My head is XL and it felt like it didn&#x27;t reach whole way back for the Velcro but in the same time it felt like having a big hat on my head...&lt;br /&gt;Nothing wrong with the product but it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> The price made me hesitate at first to buy this as I usually go cheap when I can.  So glad I decided to go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then it took a couple nights to get used to wearing but after that I fell in love with this Sleep Mask.  Total black out of light and comfortable.</li>
    <li> I have two other sleep masks, one I bought at walmart and its not very good. The other one was alright but the elastic band stretched out and wouldn&#x27;t block out the light. The sleep master is the quality product I was looking for. I just wish it was available in black.</li>
    <li> This received a good review on a travelling site, because of its soft feel and comfortable wrap-around fit that doesn&#x27;t pressure the eyes. The fit is comfortable as advertised however, my eyes were as uncomfortable under this mask as most others. Not for me and my search for the right sleeping mask continues.</li>
    <li> Covers eyes and ears which is good because it helps to hold in my ear plugs.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to block out lights when I sleep in on weekends, and also when I travel.  It works very well, fits comfortably, and blocks out the light, like it&#x27;s supposed to.  Good product!</li>
    <li> For those days when the sun comes up too early, this baby helps you sleep in.  Nice and cool although sometimes it slides off while sleeping(maybe I just wear it too loose).  I was worried it might be too warm because I get hot easily, but it feels fine.</li>
    <li> This will probably be the only sleep mask I will ever buy. I love it. It completely blocks out the light and also helps to block out sound.</li>
    <li> Not as I expect it but it does the job, I believe it is over priced. $9 equals the value I got.</li>
    <li> This is very comfortable compared to the standard kind with elastic straps those put a-lot of pressure on the sides and leave impressions on your face basically uncomfortable where as this is soft pressure on your eyes without strong pressure on the sides like just enough that it will keep your eyelids closed without you trying to,the only thing is the bottom corners that are next to your nose can tickle because they sit kind of loose,well for me they do,it would be better if they would incorporate a corner flexible frame that would make it semi rigid with maybe a piece of felt on the outside of course.I would recommend this you can adjust it to block all light and comfortable to boot I hope this helps and thanks for reading</li>
    <li> The wife insists on sleeping with the TV on. The light it emits is very distracting and keeps me from getting into a deep sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a few different masks but they&#x27;re flimsy and tear or they&#x27;re uncomfortable or they get lint all over them or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to spend a little more and try this one and well...you know what they say about getting what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very soft, offers full coverage so there&#x27;s no bits of light that creep in and it covers the ears well so it muffles the sound a bit too. It doesn&#x27;t create silence or anything but for those interested, they include a package of ear plugs to use if you choose. (I myself can&#x27;t sleep with ear plugs)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;m quite satisfied with this sleep mask and use it every night with great results.</li>
    <li> I really like that its very soft and thick. Works real good. No light at all. Helps muffle out my husbands snoring too.</li>
    <li> It was poorly designed. It kept moving. It certainly didn&#x27;t help in sleeping. Actually, it was uncomfortable. I don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone who wants help sleeping.</li>
    <li> While I think it&#x27;s a bit on the expensive side this mask is Soft and Comfortable. It is the best I&#x27;ve tried. After having tried so many flat thin masks that I was never happy with I took the plunge and spent the money for this thicker mask. It really is comfortable- May take a few days to get used to the extra weight of the thicker mask but it is very worth it. The Velcro makes for easy adjustment for a better custom fit. Overall while I think it&#x27;s a bit expensive I am glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> This mask keeps out all the light and even helps with drowning out some of the sound...I love it and would recommend this product for anyone who is a light sleeper.</li>
    <li> First off the item was on time and exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second and most importantly the type of fabric used is soft and smooth.  That is important because moving around with your head against the pillow hasn&#x27;t caused the mask to move around at all for me.  The fabric type and design also means that is does fit over my full face cpap mask very well; AND because it goes over the elastic straps in back of my head for the cpap and slides easily on the pillow I also have not needed to adjust the mask at all the last three nights of us.  I have needed to adjust the mask 2 to 3 times a night every night since I started using it a year ago, so this is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly the best purchase I have made in years.</li>
    <li> I used this for my college dorm when i shared my room. The dorm for some reason did not have air conditioner, so when summer came wearing this was not something i looked forward to since i would start to sweat a bit and it made the nights a tad uncomfortable. This isn&#x27;t something i recommend for people in humid/warm conditions. It&#x27;s like leaving a towel like mask on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it does the job, blocking light well while covering a large area. The fit is nice and it isn&#x27;t scratchy or irritating to the skin, but i didn&#x27;t get used to having a thick pad on my face.&lt;br /&gt;ultimately I won&#x27;t pay the price i did for it again. I should have gone for something thin for the sake of my comfort.</li>
    <li> I need complete quiet and darkness to fall asleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this mask would provide that. And it did at first. The mask was nicely padded. And all sounds were muffled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after some use, the mask has flattened considerably. It no longer muffles sounds like it used to. All the ends have also become \\&quot;frizzed\\&quot;. So now I&#x27;m beginning to doubt the products longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the price point, I do not see a clear advantage over other sleeping masks.</li>
    <li> The Sleep Master sleep mask saved my marriage!  My constant tossing and turning and restless nights have caused sleepless nights for my husband too!  My first night with this sleep mask allowed me to get a full nights sleep and my husband did too!  I have noticed a significant improvement in my mood since I purchased the mask and have been getting adequate rest.  This was not possible for me without this mask.  Other masks blocked out the light but I believe that the sound filtering function of the wrap around design is what made the difference!  The mask is comfortable, soft and easy to clean!  Love it!  Thank you Sleep Master!!!!!</li>
    <li> This mask is so thick u feel like ur suffocating.  For a back sleeper its incredibly uncomfortable because there is soooo much fabric in the back, also the velcro kept snagging in my hair. Don&#x27;t by this mask, terrible, went in the garbage after a few sleepless nights.</li>
    <li> This product has helped me sleep and saved my marriage!  It is comfortable and blocks out all light while allowing you to sleep through the night! Ear plugs are a plus, the softness of the mask is amazing.</li>
    <li> This is a must have! Very comfortable and works great! It helps drown out little noises too since it covers your ears. My husband loves it!</li>
    <li> I had used simple eye shades like they give you on the airplanes.  The SLEEP MASTER is comfortable, darker, and also filters out sounds.</li>
    <li> My husband is a horrible sleeper.  His brother has been using the sleepmaster mask and recommended it to my husband many years ago.  Now he sleeps like a baby!  It is so comfortable to wear, silky across your skin and pillow-like over your ears.  It keeps light from waking you up and also keeps noise to a minimum level.  I&#x27;ve always been a great sleeper but I still love wearing it for even sounder sleep.  Several of our family members have been using this mask for years.  It also makes a great gift!</li>
    <li> In 2003 my husband bought me 4 face masks for Christmas so I could try several different brands. One of them just happened to be a Sleepmaster. The other three didn&#x27;t come close to comparing! The Sleepmaster: I LOVE IT!!! I am buying 3 for my kids because they keep stealing mine. :) Six years later it is still in great shape, has served me beautifully in hotels, on airplanes and at home. It&#x27;s comfortable, soft, doesn&#x27;t mess up my hair during travel and blocks out all light. Thank goodness the inside label had the company name and I was able to find them for more orders. I will recommend Sleepmaster to everyone!  Thank you Sleepmaster for creating such a great product!    Colleen Crawford  [[ASIN:B0015NZ6FK Revolutionary, Patented SLEEP MASTER Sleep Mask]]</li>
    <li> Even though it is a substantial unit, it does not reduce outside noise as professed.  The common $10 sleep masks work just as well and are somewhat more comfortable because they are lighter.  Will NOT purchase again.</li>
    <li> The mask is ok, but considering its price, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a worth buy.</li>
    <li> This is little more than an uncomfortable, ill fitting towel around your face.  There is tons of light let in by the nose slit. Way too big for my head...to keep it on your face it has to be so tight that it crushes your eyelids/eyeballs!  Doesn&#x27;t wrap around head&#x27;s circumference....it goes at an angle from your eyes to the tip of your head..Not comfortable...doesn&#x27;t fit...doesn&#x27;t block light...squishes your eyes and leaves no room for REM (rapid eye movement) during sleep.  Thumbs down...but at least they accept returns!  I&#x27;m out $6 bucks for shipping though..don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Not sure i sleep any better with it but it&#x27;s more comfortable than most of these contraptions.  Hard to go wrong with an investment in sleep !</li>
    <li> Sleep Master Sleep Mask is very uncomfortable to use while sleeping, it is too thick and slips off your face! I would not recommend it, it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> The velcro allows you to really get the mask nice and tight so it won&#x27;t slip while you&#x27;re tossing and turning at night.  You may remember the movie Aliens, and the little face sucker that attached itself to your face and injected you with its alien eggs?  The mask is like that, but instead of covering your mouth and nose and using you for breeding purposes, this friendly little mask covers only your eyes and ears and quite possibly whispers sweet nothings directly into your brain.  The first night I wore the mask I slept wonderfully, but I did have a dream that I was trying to drive my car with the mask on, and then I had another dream that I was blind and wondering around a local shopping center.  I am fairly certain these were just dreams, but in case it wasn&#x27;t a dream, my experiences would have to force me not to recommend driving or wondering around the mall looking for neon hotpants while wearing this mask.  Comfortable fit and really keeps out the light and noise of the world, but may cause wacky blindness dreams.  Since I enjoy both sleeping soundly and wacky dreams, this mask gets a well deserved 5 stars.</li>
    <li> The new one is not like the old one!!!  They have changed it and made it with different material that doesn&#x27;t breath or feel comfortable.  I purchased the original mask maybe 4 years ago and it was awesome.  As a nurse who worked the night shift I used it all the time.  Then I went on vacation and took it with me and left it in the hotel.  I was so upset that I no longer had it that I bought 2 more, just to have a spare.  I am so disappointed.  Now I sweat when I wear it to fall asleep.  I can&#x27;t take it - so I just take it off and it stays on the table next to my bed.  I am very, very sad.  I don&#x27;t know what they are using now on the inside but it must be synthetic.  Please go back to your old manufacturer!</li>
    <li> When sleeping with it in bed I find that it does slip around by the morning time and sometimes off, but all in all it is comfortable and I do use it every night so that says something :-) Also, it is very attractive as far as sleep masks go. lol</li>
    <li> I am a 53 y/o woman who can&#x27;t sleep with any light or sound (unless it&#x27;s \\&quot;white\\&quot; sound). Now, I have tried dozens of eye/sleep masks, including magnetic therapy. This mask not only FEELS comfy, it COMPLETELY blocks out light and GREATLY minimizes sound. I lived in an apartment building for 2 years and wouldn&#x27;t have been able to survive it not for this mask. Nothing like it! I&#x27;m sort of like a baby who can&#x27;t sleep without his blanket, but for me it&#x27;s this sleep mask! God forbid I can&#x27;t find it at night, the whole house is in an uproar looking for mama&#x27;s sleep mask! Today I ordered my second sleep mask as I wash mine once a week when I wash my sheets, this way I won&#x27;t have to worry about it drying on time (I wash by hand in the sink and hang to dry). The mask is over 2 years old and still in excellent condition! Order one, order two, you will be HAPPY beyond belief with this mask!</li>
    <li> FOLLOW-UP NOTE 4/7/12:  I apologize for the length and details in this review which relates also to sleeping disorders instead of  a review of the mask only.  I realize this is more information than most of you  need or want to know. I was hoping that adding this additional information of what we have done to treat this, for those who have sleeping disorders, that it might possibly be helpful to them. It is a serious condition that can have a terrible affect on one&#x27;s body, mind and health. For those who don&#x27;t want or need this information, please forgive me and just disregard. The mask works great! God bless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my son as he has very serious sleeping disorders. Mostly circadian rh ythm problem.  We have tried just about everything over the years. Dr. said best room temperature for sleeping is 68 degrees. We do that.  In fact, I do that for myself too and it does make a difference.Sleeps some during the day so black out room. Unable to do that right now. (Thus sleeping mask is needed). Bought him a Tempurpedic mattress (this helped greatly and worth every penny.  Also bought him the Tempurpedic pillows and he says he will never sleep with any other kind of pillow now, he loves  them). We tried several of the cheaper copy cat kind but they were not the same, unfortunately. Dr. said, \\&quot;make sure he has plenty of light during waking hours\\&quot;. Dr. prescribed a light machine but insurance wouldn&#x27;t pay for it because in New Mexico, they say, we have plenty of light. Wrong. Not if lots of trees and one small window with northern exposure.  Bought him machine for \\&quot;white noise\\&quot; rainfall, etc. If room is too quiet, it is difficult to sleep. That made big difference too.  Sprays lavender (aromatherapy for relaxation) on his pillow.  He takes Melatonin tablet at time to sleep. These help too. Whew, it&#x27;s been a job!  LIGHT is biggest remaining problem, other than sleeping with 4-5 toy poodles (which remains unchangeable),  so I  bought the mask.  It was more expensive than most, but then it is a patented design and there is more to it.  I bought  2 other  masks, one for me. The other to put in freezer for sinus  headaches. He tried them and the nose areas let in too much light as he has larger nose than me. This mask, he says, feels better, only lets a tiny bit of light in at bottom nose area.  He likes it too because it covers his ears and gives him  a \\&quot;comfy\\&quot; feeling and drowns out louder unwanted noise.  He still sleeps with a pillow over his head which he has done since a child and he still will not stop it.  I thought the mask would help him stop that but it hasn&#x27;t so far. Also, I thought when it said the mask interior was cotton fabric I thought that meant the inside side was cotton.  It is not . It is all a very soft satin, inside and outside. I guess they meant the interior inside the mask that plumps it up.  No big deal though. he uses it and likes it and that is something!The first night he did the velcro too tight and his ears were sore the next day. He has fixed that problem by not attaching it so tightly. While it does not bother him too much that there is no space to keepthe mask from touching his eyes inside, it would bother me, thus, I chose a different, less expensive mask.  I am wondering for &#x27;fitful&#x27; sleepers if a fabric other than soft, slippery satin would be better to keep the mask in place  with less movement and sliding down?  Just a suggestion.  The seamstress, designer in me talking.  Being a young man of few words ,  and slow to get excited about many things, my young son says this mask is \\&quot;adequate\\&quot;. That is a good review from him.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. Very soft and cosy. Did not yet try to wash it.</li>
    <li> I like it and its comfortable, but at night it slips off sometimes. It is still better than the other sleep masks that I have used.</li>
    <li> These work FANTASTIC... blocking all outside light from disrupting your peaceful rest.. - nice and soft, and you can wash them in Woolite if you need to clean them up, as long as you are super careful when you do it.</li>
    <li> Working graveyard shift is tough especially when my job requires me to be alert and focused as I count millions every night but getting sleep during the day is a lot tougher. Thanks to this revolutionary sleep mask I&#x27;ve been getting my 6-8 hours of uninterrupted sleep a day which I absolutely need to perform my job accurately! It completely blacks out daylight and minimizes noise from the surroundings even without the earplugs that came with it. It even keeps the hair away from my face that causes breakouts. Definitely worth every penny!!!</li>
    <li> Works well and covers ears which is nice</li>
    <li> Comfortable, and does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> It is indeed comfortable. It works for omitting light; however, it does not work as an ear muff or to omit sound, which was the reason I why I purchased this product. I&#x27;m very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Wow, this sleep mask is the best! I slept like a baby last night. So plush and soft, wow! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!&amp;#34; A+ product! A+ customer service!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a finely structured product, but I don&#x27;t like these fake materials, which seem to stain easily, on my face.  I would prefer cotton on the face side of the mask like some of my other masks in the past.  My fault though for not reading it clearly.  If you prefer wearing polyester clothes to cotton ones or polyester sheets to cotton ones, then you will like this on your face as you sleep.</li>
    <li> This mask is very comfortable. I have been using it while taking a nap and it blocks the light and muffles the sound. I plan to use it for an trip overseas. I anticipate that it will work very well to allow me to sleep while it is still light. JR</li>
    <li> This sleep mask does the job. I would recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a quality product</li>
    <li> It slides around some but does block well. Is comfortable.</li>
    <li> Too hot for me. Nice though.</li>
    <li> No pressure on face. Very comfy</li>
    <li> I tried using it about 5 times and just couldn&#x27;t get comfortable. Somehow light finds it&#x27;s way in, I get overheated. It&#x27;s just not my preference.</li>
    <li> I have tried more than one sleep mask and the problem is that they move on my head during the night and sometimes end up off, defeating the purpose of keeping light from my eyes until I wake up. NOT THIS ONE! The velcro in the back keeps it where I need it to be, plus it is really comfortable.</li>
    <li> This is a great sleep mask. It tends to fall off my face in the middle of the night, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me cs I&#x27;m asleep. It&#x27;s smoothy silk and feels refreshing on my skin. I even bought one for my friend.</li>
    <li> I have had dozens of inferior sleep masks through the years.  I have used this one and it beats them all and is the only one I will ever buy again. It is comfortable, completely blocks the light, and even some sound.  Really well constructed.</li>
    <li> This simply doesn&#x27;t keep out sound, as promised. Actually creates some sound as your ear rubs on the fabric, sounds like a racket.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but this warranted one. I tried this one and one that was half the price but looked cooler (the dream essentials one), and my girlfriend and I started playing Paper-Rock-Scissors to see who gets the Sleep Master vs the Dream Essentials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I... *chokes back tears*... left it on a plane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the guy who finds it in the seat pocket on the way back from Costa Rica... YOU&#x27;RE WELCOME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying 3 more right now, one for me, one for my girl, and one for my boss. It&#x27;s really so good that I think it will earn me boss-points as a random gift for a guy who jet-sets all over the world.</li>
    <li> Love my eye mask.  I really like how it covers my whole eye area.  Unlike most where they just cover your actual eye lids, this covers that and a lot more.  It also helps drown out the sounds cause it covers your ears.  I usually go to bed before my husband, and he just pulls it off gently (without undoing the velcro) and tosses it aside.  That way I don&#x27;t sleep with it all night.  But it is comfortable to sleep with it all through the night.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement sleeping mask, but found out this wasn&#x27;t for me. It wouldn&#x27;t stay on and since it was made to cover ears completely for noise cancelling, it made my ears uncomfortable, so I left it off &#x27;cause I was feeling just enough pressure on them no matter how loose or tight I had it on.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, is very soft and blocks out all the light even from the TV. Very comfortable to sleep in.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of thorough research before purchasing this mask. Like many have stated before, this mask puts pressure on your eyes. It is also fairly large and thick AND the fabric is not breathable so your face ends up getting sweaty (and this is coming from someone who really doesn&#x27;t sweat a lot normally!!) The wrap around the ears doesn&#x27;t really do much. And like many have mentioned, light comes through the nose area. I would think again before spending a good $25 on this thing!</li>
    <li> Slips off head easily. Not worth the price remotely. Not sure what aspect is patented but didn&#x27;t provide improvement over tradition masks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few sleep masks, but I absolutely love this one. It has complete coverage without being bulky. I also like the fact that it slightly covers your ears. I like to sleep in complete darkness and this one does the trick. Also, it arrived very quickly, before I&#x27;d expected it. I would not hesitate to order from this seller again. I was very satisfied.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Sleeping with the mask on your side can hurt your ears.  Used them with ear plugs and that made it worse on the ears.</li>
    <li> okay so I bought this product because I am a college student who is looking to get a good sound free, light free, night of sleep. The students in my dorm tend to be loud and obnoxious at night and after many fitful nights of sleep the past couple of weeks, I decided it was time to go find a nice sleep mask. I searched several different masks but all of them seemed too flimsy and I had little faith in the masks themselves. When I came across the Sleep Master Sleep Mask it appealed to me very much. Built in noise muffling, soft breathable fabric, the complete and total absence of light, this mask had all the elements I was looking for in a promising looking sleep mask. As soon as I saw the price I was reluctant to buy it because, being a jobless college student, I don&#x27;t have very much money. So I sat in front of my laptop for about 5 minutes weighing the pros and cons. I finally decided to just go ahead a buy it because this would be a potentially a good investment. When I opened the package and had a good look/feel of the item for the first time, I had no quarells with what I received. The fabric is soft and silky feeling and when I tried it on it blocked all the light from my eyes. That night I was so exited to go to sleep and finally have a good nights rest for the first time in weeks! After applying the mask and adjusting it around my head I laid down and attempted to sleep. The first thing I noticed was that the mask liked to slip and slide all over my face. It fell off several times during the night so I adjusted it a little tighter to fit my head more snug. I than began to get a headache because of the pressure on my head. Eventually I feel asleep but was later awaken by noise! I could hear everything as clear as if I had no sound muffling system or whatever over my ears. I quickly reached for the ear plugs that came with the mask and they instantly blocked out all the noise. So than I feel back asleep. When I woke up in the morning I was thrilled to take thismask off of my face. As I took the mask away from my eyes and looked around the room I noticed something strange. EVERYTHING WAS BLURRY! At first I though my eyes were just adjusting to the light, but an hour later everything was still blurry(so blurry I couldn&#x27;t read the words on my laptop). I don&#x27;t know if its because the mask makes your eyes dry or the pressure of the mask on your eyes caused your vision to be blurred, whatever the reason this mask rendered me temporarily blind! I tried it out the next night and had the same results as the night before. Headache, discomfort, pressure, and temporary blindness. I then for the first time ever, returned the mask to the sender. I got my money back so all is good, but I would not recommend this mask to anyone! I&#x27;m not really sure how this product has so many good reviews but it absolutly and utterly sucks! (the only reason I gave this product 2 stars is because I like the ear plugs, and the color/fabric on the mask)</li>
    <li> This is the second time i&#x27;ve purchased this mask.  The last one i bought was about 2 years ago and had it till my dog ate it.  This is unfortunate because the company decided to modify the mask a bit by making it small which would make you think that contouring your face would be better but it made things much worse.  I don&#x27;t know why in the world they did that because the manages to fall off my face during the night;every night!  By making it smaller they&#x27;ve compromised the stability of the mask.  You might think that i&#x27;m not making it tight enough but it doesn&#x27;t make a difference...The old (larger) version sufficiently wrapped and stayed wrapped around your face all night. For this amount of money it should do that.. Still and all the fabric is still very comfortable and it still helps me fall asleep.</li>
    <li> I have never slept so comfortably in my life! This product puts you in total darkness (which I need - every little LED or ambient light irritates me), and has a nice snug satin feel. I sleep with earplugs since my husband snores, but the extra little coverage from the mask really makes a difference and helps muffle the sound even more. I almost bought one of the masks with little holes bored out so it doesn&#x27;t put pressure on your eyes, but for me personally, I found the snug, satin feeling on my eyes comforting and pleasant.</li>
    <li> Best sleep mask I ever owned.  It&#x27;s very comfortable and it really blocks out all light.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mask. I sent this one to a friend who also suffers from debilitating migraines. It&#x27;s perfect! Light is totally blocked and noise is muted. With the velcro you can adjust perfectly so nothing is squeezing your head that is already hurting beyond description. Even more wonderful is that it&#x27;s washable. The fabric is so smooth and silky on your skin.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my light-averse girlfriend and she loves it. Saved a purchase of blackout curtains. and she says it&#x27;s quite comfortable. Fellow night owls, especially those prone to saving the world on Xbox, this is a way better purchase than flowers.</li>
    <li> I usually do not post reviews but felt very compelled to write about this purchase. I have 6 different sleep masks that were either too tight, too loose, or leave bruises around my eyes after waking up the next morning. I took one more chance to get the sleep mask and I have finally found the perfect mask!! The material is smooth, fits the face with ease, and blocks out a good amount of external noise. I will never have to search for another sleeping mask again-this is the one!</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd Sleep Master product I have purchased and each arrived promptly and packaged appropriately, enclosed in a reusable ziplock style bag. I highly recommend this product and the seller. Being an &#x27;everything has to be just so&#x27; kind of sleeper, this mask is extremely comfortable and effective. Support good businesses that offer good products.</li>
    <li> This is such a fantastic sleep mask, I just bought one for a friend whose room (even with blackout curtains) is still too light. Not only does this mask black out ALL light, it is like a hug for your head. The size is perfect and comfortable. The hook and loop closure is wide and smooth and doesn&#x27;t create any weird, uncomfortable lumps or bumps. It stays nice and secure so the mask doesn&#x27;t move when you sleep and roll over. The satin is smooth and cool, so your head doesn&#x27;t sweat or get uncomfortably hot. I highly recommend this mask to anyone who must sleep in a room where there is ANY light at night. Your body need true black to take advantage of all the benefits of sleeping, so buy this mask and enjoy!</li>
    <li> best sleep mask ever&lt;br /&gt;had to buy another just for my travel bag&lt;br /&gt;use it ever single night amazing coverage</li>
    <li> I sleep with my eyes open, yuck...I know....but I can&#x27;t help it!! :( That means I have dry, itchy, hot achy eyes most of the time. I wake up with bloodshot, dry eyes and my first few blinks are extremely painful. I have tried many sleep masks, and thought I would give this one a try - hoping I could get rid of the small gap around my nose that all the others leave. ...not to mention I never wake up with them still on! The problem I have with these is....they won&#x27;t stay put!! The material is soft and satiny, very cozy...they cover more of your face, which helps block out more light (or air, in my case) and they fit well...you can tighten or loosen as needed. ...but no matter what I did...one slight turn of my head and they slip or slide right off. I have even tightened them to the point of being uncomfortably tight....only to have them slip right off when I turned my head! Maybe a strip of no slip on the back will help?? I may try that...I really wanted to love these....but so far, I am disappointed!! :(</li>
    <li> Over the past year I have purchased 3 of these (one to leave over my girls house).  It does seem to be rather large but I find this comfortable once you adjust the tension of the velcro straps. You eyelids will rub against the material somewhat but that doesnt deter me It doesn&#x27;t block out 100 percent of the light but what it does block out works for me.  I enjoy sleeping with this product but I can see how some people may have issues with it.</li>
    <li> I work nights, so this was a life saver. Its super soft and very comfortable to sleep in, it also covers your years so it muffles sounds.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mask because in my new house I have a skylight in the bedroom and the morning sun was waking me up.  This mask works like a charm and is very comfortable.  I do not have any problems with it coming off my head or being too tight.  It is fully adjustable and does not make my head hot at all.  Very please with my purchase and would recommend to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> I really like this mask BUT its soo silky soft that it slides down too easily! I could make it extra tight but of course that wouldn&#x27;t be comfortable. I&#x27;m going to have to make a modification.... Sew in some fabric that will keep it from slipping and sliding down.</li>
    <li> I like the Sleep-Mask. It stays over my eyes when I&#x27;m sleeoing.&lt;br /&gt;I get a Nice Quiet night of Sleep, A Real Restfull night of Sleeo.&lt;br /&gt;  I really like this Mask.</li>
    <li> Slippery, hot. Mine was obviously pre-used as well. If better materials were used, this may work</li>
    <li> Blocks out all light, Fits my head, I have a medium to large sized head. Very soft and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is sometimes my eyelashes rub if I open my eyes, but its not a problem for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this mask for my wife to replace one that she lost. She thought her old one was the best possible sleep mask until this one arrived. Its soft side panels limit noise as well as providing nearly-perfect light blocking and comfort.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because the product description said it was also sound muffling and I was tired of ear plugs. Guess what was in the package for sound muffling? Ear plugs!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, nicely packaged. Very comfortable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the mask for upcoming travel and tested it out at home first.  It is very smooth and satiny which feels so comfortable and cozy.  It blocked out all the light from street lamps, my neighbor&#x27;s security light, and the clock radio on the bedstand.  I was concerned that a mask might press too much on my eyes, but though it&#x27;s tight enough to block light (you adjust the Velcro very easily for comfort), there&#x27;s still plenty of space for air circulation and to blink your eyes.  The opening over the nose is also so light and comfortable you don&#x27;t realize the mask is anywhere near the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also read in other reviews that the Velcro attachment on the back bothers some people.  I&#x27;m a side sleeper, so wasn&#x27;t concerned, but in the interest of a thorough review, I tried it out on my back and had no problem.  I do use a memory foam pillow so maybe the surface a back sleeper is resting on would matter, but I was comfortable and for side sleepers it isn&#x27;t even an issue.  Nothing but smooth surface on the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy I got this, as I can see it will help me get a better sleep at home as well as during travel.  And it&#x27;s made in the USA which is a big plus with me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Used the mask on vacation and it worked beautifully.  It helped me actually sleep on the flights this time and was invaluable in the hotel.  Blocked any light very well and muffled the noise enough without the added earplugs.  It creates a feeling of separation and coziness that is conducive to sleep in situations where I usually have trouble.  Very happy I had this for the trip.</li>
    <li> It blocks out light for sure, but takes a while to get used to.</li>
    <li> PROS: super comfy.  The fabric is very soft and plush.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt my head and you can adjust how tight you want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: of course you are going to see a little bit from the slit in the nose.  I think it depends on the person&#x27;s nose how it&#x27;s going to fit, I think I have a bigger nose (Italian).  If I pull the mask down to where it&#x27;s suppose to be, it kinda pinches my nose some.  If i pull it up where it&#x27;s more comfortable around my nose, then I see a bit of light.  Also, I think I toss and turn a lot in the night, because I wake up and the thing is off or around my neck.  I don&#x27;t secure it very tight because it will give me a headache if its too tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: I think the material being so soft and the flexibility of adjusting makes it worth it.  I&#x27;m very sensitive to fabrics, and a lot of materials make me itch.  This is seriously soft, and plush.  You will feel like a Royal sleeping in it.  I think, yes, the 25 bucks was worth it, and I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
    <li> I am a nurse who works night shift. I purchased this on a whim because I wanted to try out a different style of sleep mask. I am very impressed with the quality and feel of the fabric. I even put it to the test one day while sleeping with the curtains open. Since the sides are thick and the mask wraps over your ears, it helps to muffle noises, too!&lt;br /&gt; The only downside is that I will find myself waking with a hot feeling from my ears to the temples of my forehead.  :/  Perhaps this is because I do not sleep on my back with my head open to air. I&#x27;m unsure? That is my only reason for giving this product 4/5 stars.</li>
    <li> This product might be good for some folks...but I did not like because it was sooooo BIG!</li>
    <li> I am a light sleeper and have frequent migraines so very sensitive to light and sound. I&#x27;ve tried many eye masks over the years and this is the best. It&#x27;s soft and smooth and you can adjust pressure of wrap to stay in place. The padding extends over ears to help keep out sound without actual ear plugs. I use this and white noise. Works great.</li>
    <li> It does the same job of cheaper eye masks at 2x the price.</li>
    <li> Hard to keep on at times, a bit warm in summer (though my choice for winter camping trip.)  I prefer a lighter, molded eye cup.</li>
    <li> At last the TV in the bedroom doesn&#x27;t keep me awake while the soaps are being viewed in all their glory ( the only time I can avoid the light or the sound ). :-) [[ASIN:B0015NZ6FK Revolutionary, Patented SLEEP MASTER Sleep Mask]]</li>
    <li> This mask is well made and works perfectly.  When considering buying, I was wondering if it would be comfortable enough for me to actually wear.  It is even better than I imagined.  It&#x27;s very soft, comforting and unobtrusive.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks now and my sleep has improved significantly.  It helps create the perfect quiet, dark environment.  Also, I&#x27;ve washed it twice and it comes out looking brand new.  I recommend it to anyone who wants a high quality sleep mask!  Linda - RI</li>
    <li> It lets too much light in the nose part which actually wakes me up more than sleepiong without it.  I&#x27;ve tried different tightness and positions but you just cant keep the light out of the bottom bit of the mask.</li>
    <li> Since I started using this mask I have had my wife chide me 3 or 4 times for not turning out the light (on my side of the bed), because I completely forget that it is on.  The material of the mask is very satiny and easy on the face.  I like the way the mask wraps around the ears though I think to advertise that as a sound blocker glorifies it somewhat.  It just feels better to have something go on top of your ear rather than around the top of your ear.</li>
    <li> Best night mask ever.  Extremely comfortable.  You don&#x27;t feel any pressure along your ears, nose or around your eyes when using it.  I use it a lot now on nights when the moon is out or if I really need to sleep during the day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always fought the idea of having to wear a mask when I go to bed so I read the Amazon reviews very carefully.  Obviously, since the Sleepmaster has almost 300 reviews, this was an immediate sign of a winner.  Bottom line is it proved to be an excellent choice.  I slept another 2 hours thanks to Sleepmaster. Blocking out the sunlight (or any light!) to build melatonin is truly important and I never realized this until I wore the mask.  Get it folks!</li>
    <li> This is the best sleep mask I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one I used, before sticking with this one, was made of black neoprene which after three weeks of nightly use made my eyes swell and my face develop a rash, so for three more weeks I had an itchy, red, puffy facial problem, which as my son would say, was a bummer, Dude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Sleep Master eye mask nightly, for the past two years or so, and it causes no problems. The coverage is terrific, it can be adjusted with Velcro strips in back, it keeps more light out than the neoprene one I had, which didn&#x27;t cover enough, let light in from around my nose, and also fit too tight around my brow area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let my husband borrow my SLEEP MASTER eye mask and use it when I am lying beside him reading in bed with a bedside lamp on and he has to get up early for work. When I turn out the light I nudge him and he gives it back to me. The nice thing about how the SLEEP MASTER is made is that my husband wearing it does not stretch it out and make it too big for me, which is because the material is not stretchy--you use the Velcro closure for tightening and loosening it. (Big Duh Here: I guess I should be generous and buy my husband his own mask.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This SLEEP MASTER eye mask does NOT block out noise--as some reviewer claimed--not for me, anyway; and it isn&#x27;t made to block out noise--it&#x27;s an EYE mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For noise blocking, I use Howard Leight Max Lite uncorded ear plugs, bought in bulk (500 at a time) via a shop whose rear end rhymes with Hey!. I wear earplugs every night because my husband doesn&#x27;t just snore, he snorts and chokes (he has sleep apnea), and otherwise makes disturbing sounds I can&#x27;t identify and sure don&#x27;t want to hear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SLEEP MASTER, though not made of silk, has a silky feel, and that feels great against my skin. I&#x27;m sensitive to fabrics, textures, all sorts of things, and I love, even need, how with the SLEEP MASTER, I can roll over from lying on my back relaxing before sleep, to sleeping on each side, throughout the night, without being aware of the mask. (Aside from the allergic reaction I had to the neoprene eye mask, I was always aware of its fabric being a bit puffy, a bit scratchy, a bit too tight in places, and that&#x27;s just too many bits.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In nearly two years, though it is of course stained, using it at the end of yoga sessions for the Corpse (or relaxation) Pose, and of course, every night for sleep, I have not had to wash it. The SLEEP MASTER is a paradox: it&#x27;s delicate (that&#x27;s why it feels so silky), so I wouldn&#x27;t launder it, though others might try and succeed at it, but it&#x27;s construction is tough enough to have lasted this long for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is everything soothing to me about The SLEEP MASTER, except the price which is a bit much, but I sleep so easily using it, and it lasts so long, that it&#x27;s worth the price--and more--to me, though maybe I shouldn&#x27;t admit that last part online where retailers or resellers might see.

    <li> I bought this for my husband as a birthday gift and he loved it!  He&#x27;s fallen asleep much more quickly, and now I can stay up and watch my TV shows without any complaints :)  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This helps me sleep like nothing else.  Perfect weight and the fabric is great.  Really blocks light - even if you toss and turn.  Far superior to any other eye mask out there!</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is soft and the wide band around the side is a good feature but it rested flat on my eyes creating a bit too much pressure to be comfortable, so I had to return it.</li>
    <li> The product is too hot on your head, which is more of a distraction from sleeping than light or noise. High hopes, but not recommended.</li>
    <li> I really love this sleep mask, it helps me sleep in my rented house with blinds instead of curtains.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and it works.</li>
    <li> It slips off my head over the course of the night.  I sleep face down and move around a lot, so it might not be an issue for others.  I also have very short hair, which may be a factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sleep mask I got for free on a Virgin Atlantic flight worked much better, but it broke after a couple years of use.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the worst blindfold for sleeping.  It wraps around your head like a pillow but its smooth satin so it slides off with the slightest head movement.  The velcro on the back sticks to pillow and hair.  Also it covers the ears and partial forehead and holds in heat; I might as well wrap a pillow around my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> I purchased the masks for my daughters who work late nights in the food and beverage industry.  Their apartment windows do not come with adequate shades and therefore they do not receive the proper amount of good solid sleep.  This sleep mask is helping them achieve a better rest.</li>
    <li> Feel very bulky to wear,  I didn&#x27;t use it for long</li>
    <li> The SLEEP MASTER sleep mask is the best sleep mask that I have ever owned!!!  I have been working on the graveyard shift for well over ten years and I can&#x27;t stand to see the light, even a little of it when I sleep.  The Sleep Master mask covers my eyes in totality when I sleep on my sides or on my back.  It&#x27;s very comfortable and light unlike some other masks that puts stress on my sinus areas.  Many masks that I&#x27;ve tried have elastic or velcro but will stretch in time.  When that happens I&#x27;ve had to tie a knot to pick up the slack.  You will not have this problem with this mask.  There is more than enough space to adjust my mask or even loan it to my son&#x27;s when I&#x27;m working.  The price for this mask was very reasonable compared to other high end mask of which I still own!!!  I highly recommend the SLEEP MASTER sleep mask for anyone who needs a great night of sleep like I do!!!</li>
    <li> Brought this for my son that&#x27;s in college. His room has large windows and even with blinds light filters in. He loves the mask and says he gets much better sleep now. It took him a few nights to get used because he never used one before.</li>
    <li> My husband sometimes works night shifts and has to sleep during the day; unfortunately our blinds don&#x27;t keep much light out.  This mask has helped him get the rest he needs during the day.  Really blocks out the light and he says it&#x27;s super light on his face, doesn&#x27;t get in the way or bother him at all.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> frayed after two weeks. while it stays tight  the pieces are very annoying to sleep with. would not recommend for use</li>
    <li> My experience with this sleep mask was poor. It does not contour to my face well, is too slippery &amp; does not stay on well. IT WAS A BIG WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
    <li> True, this is very comfortable to wear. Doesn&#x27;t push into the eyeballs or wrap too tightly around the head (velcro makes it adjustable). That being said, I can&#x27;t use this because it&#x27;s boiling hot &amp; so wakes me up during the night. Not surprising since it is made from synthetic fabric &amp; filled with synthetic padding. BTW, I live in a moderate climate - neither hot nor cold - and tried this during the winter.</li>
    <li> This thing is very comfortable, but I have found that I can&#x27;t use it because it sits on the bridge of my nose, causing some restriction and discomfort.  This probably isn&#x27;t an issue for everyone, but it drives me nuts.  I&#x27;ve found that a more traditional sleep mask design works better for me.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband who works a rotating night shift, we had tried other cheaper made ones and nothing has worked like this has. He likes the Velcro rather than the elastic, and that it fits snug around his nose not letting light in where others fail. I have even used it from time to time!</li>
    <li> I think this sleep mask is good, but it has a big problem, and that is, if you really want to block the light you have to tighten it and when you do that, the mask puts too much pressure on the eyes which is uncomfortable. Besides, I think it is too expensive. In fact, I think this product is not much different from a standard sleep mask. Think twice before buying this, because this is not as wonderful as it seems.</li>
    <li> This works wonderfully and feels very soft, however it does stain white pillows and makes the face a little hot.</li>
    <li> Thanks. Best sleep during the day ever! I have been on bed rest for weeks and my meds make me drowsey. I got this mask and have had the best rest! The sunlight usually kept me up now I just have to hide it from my husband.</li>
    <li> Putting the mask on is like entering a quiet world. It doesn&#x27;t shift. It&#x27;s soft, well-made, I use earplugs, too and this mask seals the sleep deal.</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed my new face mask. As a new cpap user this mask helps me feel like I am in my usual sleep position even though I am not sleeping on my stomach. I love it!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Helps to block out both light &amp; sound, great at encouraging relaxation. Arrived before expected, very happy with both product &amp; supplier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend the Sleep Mask.  It&#x27;s very soft &amp; gentle on the eyes, unlike several other masks I&#x27;ve used, &amp; since it&#x27;s adjustable, it&#x27;s never too tight or too loose.</li>
    <li> I have tried many sleep masks &amp; this one takes the cake! Adjustable &amp; very comfortable. It not only blocks light, but also muffles sound.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a mask with superior coverage and comfort, but found neither. For me, I had issues with light leakage by the nose, the mask kept slipping and not staying on properly, and when I made it tight enough it gave me a headache. I&#x27;m looking to upgrade from a cheap elastic type mask, but this felt like a downgrade. I can&#x27;t review sound dampening, because I don&#x27;t care about that. But I&#x27;m back to shopping for a mask upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars because the fabric quality is nice and giving the benefit of the doubt that perhaps if I had a different head/face shape, it would fit better. -3 stars for the rest of the experience.</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical of the &#x27;Sleep Master&#x27; Sleep Mask, as it was so imposing and cumberbund-like.  Upon slipping it on my head I was instantly transported to a comfortable, sensory-deprived void...I felt like M.J. on Propofol, except before he died. .  It is like a satin sarcophagus.  As someone who despises light, and enjoys a muffled experience with sound, I give this lovely product a 5 star review.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable, blocks out all light and most sound but is not sound proof. Does not get sticky and fits firmly. If you have questions please feel free to comment.</li>
    <li> So dark. So nice. I can only see a tiny bit of light down by the corners of my nose. I do have to wear it snug for it to stay in place, since there&#x27;s no elastic involved. I still wake up with it having fallen off sometimes, though.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing ever!!!!! I need my room really dark to sleep,but I also have a skylight in the room!! When I wear this mask it is sooooooooo comfortable and it does the job. No light comes in and it also keeps out some sound. I would highly recommend this to anyone who needs it dark to sleep or anyone who has had problems with other mask. I bought a second one to have on hand or to travel with. I just love it:)</li>
    <li> I like it.  I recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried way too many other sleep masks (maybe three or four other kinds).  I&#x27;ve had problems with bad material, not fitting tightly or too loose, and even an ALLERGY problem with one mask, which is not sold on Amazon any more I think.  This mask costs quite a pretty penny, but I was willing to do anything to sleep during the day, since I work at night.  This works as described: it is supple soft, fits well, and is adjustable.  Rolling side to side doesn&#x27;t make it move.  It does slide up and down a little, but that motion (hehe) shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
    <li> Bought this sleep mask for my wife. She loves how it wraps around her head without irritating her ears, unlike the others she had used. Also, how comfortable the fit was. The material was softest she ever tried.</li>
    <li> I use this every night and helps me sleep great!</li>
    <li> really works blocking our noise and light.  One of the best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this. It works great to block out light and he is able to sleep well.  For someone who has to sometimes sleep during the day, a mask like this is essential!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing sleep masks for a while because I&#x27;m such a light sleeper. Usually sleep masks are flimsy, but not this one. Blocks out all the light and some sound. I would definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> It is comfortable and covers well and make you sleep better.  It is great.  But it is big cover, three inches wide and goes around your entire head.  It makes you look so obvious when you fly a red eye flight.  Everyone passing by you will more or less look at you.</li>
    <li> This was bought as a gift. Was on my son&#x27;s wish-list. He is very pleased. If he is pleased then I am pleased.</li>
    <li> I used to use the memory foam style sleep masks but they are heavy and don&#x27;t completely block out the light.  This mask is very light (you&#x27;ll barely notice wearing it) and it is much more effective at blocking out the light than others I&#x27;ve tried.  I bought an extra for when the first one wears out..</li>
    <li> the mask arrived on time, undamaged and clean. I found the mask to be too thick which made it uncomfortable to sleep on my sides.</li>
    <li> This is one great seller, with some awesome products. Quick shipment and the best customer service. I have to say this is the best mask on the market. No light gets through and made of the softest material, on the planet! There is no better mask to be found...period. I promise that you will truly be happy, with this purchase. I guarantee it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so comfy... never slips over my nose and around my head... does not press down on my eyelids... and best of all no light comes in from the bottom or top... another words it really works... and I&#x27;ve used a lot of these masks that don&#x27;t... it&#x27;s worth the price because it&#x27;s made so well... much better than the cheaper masks... I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Great sleep mask.  Soft, but dense enough to block all light.  The cutaway for the nose is a god-send, as this allows for a more comfortable fit.  My only complaint is that it can get a little hot after a while.</li>
    <li> Using this sleep mask with a CPAP mask eliminates most of the ambient light in our bedroom, which makes it easier for me to get to sleep before my book reading wife.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I&#x27;d recommend it to friends and foes alike.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this eye mask given the great reviews and its high price, which I sort of assumed made it better than the cheaper masks I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask has a few nice features:&lt;br /&gt; - no annoying thin strap which usually bugs me with other masks&lt;br /&gt; - keeps ears warm which is great in winter though perhaps less so in summer&lt;br /&gt; - velcro adjustment works well though I suspect will fail over time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However it&#x27;s got a major problem that makes it completely unusable for me - once it&#x27;s on my face the tightest area is right across my eyeballs.  Squished eyeballs are INCREDIBLY uncomfortable as you might imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other flaws in the design of this mask besides the deal breaker above:&lt;br /&gt; - Doesn&#x27;t block sound at all though it purports to.  Get some cheap foam earplugs if you need to keep things quiet.&lt;br /&gt; - Nose flap/slit thing lets plenty of light in.  You will not have 100% darkness with this mask.&lt;br /&gt; - The mask has a tendency to slip off the top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to return it, but I&#x27;ve already tried sleeping with it a few times so don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s appropriate.  I guess I&#x27;ll end up tossing it and chalk it up as a lesson that good reviews and a high price don&#x27;t always make for a good purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars because the material is very nice and It feels nice against your face. However, it tends to slip during the night and doesn&#x27;t offer hardly any noise cancellation.</li>
    <li> Thanks. Solves a simple problem really effectively .This is my second one . Lost the first in camping accident I&#x27;d rather not talk about.</li>
    <li> Well this is definitely a different eye mask, but it works so well. It&#x27;s very soft and comfortable. It&#x27;s kinda large for travel, but perfect for home use (although might be nice for plane travel).</li>
    <li> I own various sleep masks due to digital gizmo led lights and outside lights, and large bedroom windows facing east, etc... Most sleep masks are piece of junk. It&#x27;s been over 6 months and since the day I bought it, I can&#x27;t sleep without this one. I love it so much that I bought one for back up just in case i lose this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why some other people are so obsessed in washing their masks so frequently. Really, is your bed or head that dirty? Maybe if you&#x27;re using hair gels and hairsprays. If you have to wash it, make sure you hand wash it in the sink with woolite and let it air dry or use an ultra gentle cycle but definitely air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are those, you know who,</li>
    <li> This mask is just GREAT. If you have had problems with sleep mask coverage in the past, please give this one a try! The different design really helps block the light and it actually stays over your eyes!</li>
    <li> Better than most, but irritates the ears if used more than a few nights.</li>
    <li> I always sleep with a mask and find this one very bulky and it tends to slide off much more easily than the lighter weight ones.</li>
    <li> This thing is so amazing. Way better than any other mask on the market. It&#x27;s soft, breathable, comfortable, blocks all the light, doesn&#x27;t put pressure on my eyes, and I can still breathe through my nose. It&#x27;s the only one that doesn&#x27;t press on my nostrils while I sleep.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very surprised that people are able to tolerate this mask. The way it puts pressure on my eyes makes it worthless for me.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing mask! I wear it every night and I really like the fact that is covers your ears. It doesn&#x27;t block out all noise, I can still hear my alarm clock, but it makes it easier to fall asleep. I never wore a mask until I started sleeping with my husband who wore one and I was jealous of his mask. I tried quite a few masks before trying this one and none of them are even close to as nice as this one. I think the quality and the unique design makes it superior to other masks. I find it very comfortable and it stays on pretty well considering I am a bit of an active sleeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line? I&#x27;ll never wear any mask besides the Sleep Master again.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what a sleep mask should be. It keeps out all light and fits comfortably. I plan to buy them to send out as gifts. This was my second order. This is the best sleep mask . It is comfortable, blocks all light and feels like a cloud.  I am taking mine on vacation and the extra&#x27;s as gifts . . I love my mask and the luxurious feel. Great job with the design and the ear plugs are a nice touch too!</li>
    <li> Hands down the best $25.00 dollar purchase I have ever made. If you have a partner/spouse/loved one who keeps you up while using their laptop, reading, or w/e else with the lights on, just get this and save the hassle of using your arm to sleep over your face. At first it took me a day or two to get use to it, but, man, two years later and I am using it still. Great for naps during the day and you never have to sleep with an arm outside of the covers again to cover your face.</li>
    <li> Used with earplugs on plane and actually slept.</li>
    <li> At first I like this product, but the wrap that goes behind your head is bulky, it gave me headaches next morning.</li>
    <li> This mask puts pressure on the eyeballs, lets light in around the nose, and is made of slightly translucent cloth.  Useless, and overpriced.  Get one that is contoured to let your eyeballs and lashes move around.</li>
    <li> I like that it works well for side sleepers but the mask doesn&#x27;t do a great job of blocking out light and does a terrible job of blocking out noise.  It actually adds noise because you hear the mask rustling on your ears.  It&#x27;s also quite uncomfortable because there is no elastic.  You either get it tight enough to stay on (very uncomfortable on face and ears) or it&#x27;s loose enough to feel good but doesn&#x27;t block any light.  Very poor product.</li>
    <li> you just have to tight or lossen it from your face&lt;br /&gt;sometimes i wake up due to the pain of tighten something close to my face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall i recommend it because it protects you from daylight, so you can sleep</li>
    <li> got it for a relative as a gift they complained it was too bulky.  I did not return it because they told me after the return date was too late</li>
    <li> i have been using this for Weeks! and it works great! my whole family was skeptical when i bought it but i used it and loved it. a day would come where my sis or dad would need to take a nap during mid day and the sun bothered them, i let them borrow my sleep mask and ever since they too fell in love with it! it is light, easy to sleep in, and it feels good. no more shades in my room that i have to manage every morning and night, perfect buy, not 1 regret.</li>
    <li> Best sleep mask yet. I&#x27;ve bought several brands over the years, but all have been a disappointment until I bought this one.  This one is comfy, doesn&#x27;t let light sneak in under the bottom edge near the nose, and adjusts perfectly with Velcro.  If I have one complaint it would be that &amp;#34;over time&amp;#34; little silk threads will fray at the bottom seam line, tickling my face. I just pluck them out when this happens, so no big deal.</li>
    <li> Fits loose on me personally otherwise feels great</li>
    <li> I looked at a million diffrent ones. This is nicely padded, and fits just like the picture. covers the ears, and comes with ear plugs. also has loops to hold the ear plugs. Great for flights, and folds easily to put in your pocket. It was a christmas gift, and i reccomend it if your wife/girl travels, complains about your snoring and light. Or is a day sleeper.</li>
    <li> With inadequate blinds, and a bedroom window facing east right near the bed, the sun was starting to burn my brain at my old apartment a few years back, making sleep all but impossible right after dawn. I also enjoy a good nap in the daytime from time to time, and it became quite clear to me that I needed a sleep mask of some sort. I did my research, and the sleep masks I was familiar with, those flimsy cheap things with the little straps, just wasn&#x27;t going to cut it. Luckily, I found the Sleep Master. This thing is just as advertised, a mask that fits perfectly to the head, blocking out light, particularly at the nose area, that so many other masks fail to do. Instead of a strap, this thing has fabric all the way around, so it stays on your head while you sleep and contributes to reducing ambient noise. Mine also came with earplugs, but I don&#x27;t use them. They&#x27;re the foam sort, that conforms to fit your ears. The thing is very comfortable, I feel naked sleeping without it. I like the thing well enough that I&#x27;m buying another two today. Due to forgetfulness on my part, I&#x27;ve nearly lost mine a few times traveling, so I&#x27;m buying more so I can leave one behind at home, have one to travel with, and keep a third in my car. If you&#x27;re looking for a sleep mask, this is the only sleep mask worth considering.</li>
    <li> it works better than i expected. i am going to order another one just like it.amazing useful product. thank you.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a gift for Valentine&#x27;s Day, but I didn&#x27;t click the fastest shipping method. I emailed the company to see if this could be changed so I could have it by Valentine&#x27;s Day. They emailed back: \\&quot;As a gesture of appreciation and romance we are upgrading to 2nd Day, no charge.\\&quot; A $[...] upgrade for free! So, it arrived on time and my wife was so surprised. She didn&#x27;t realize how bad her other sleep mask was before she got this. It is so soft, hides the light very well (think black-out), and it covers your ears a bit to muffle distracting noises. She is a light sleeper and must have a dark room and a sound machine for naps and nighttime sleep. Now all she needs is this mask and her sound machine, even when the sunlight fills the bedroom.</li>
    <li> I bought this mask because I read the \\&quot;wonderful\\&quot; reviews on this...then a close frnd told me...they could be hiring employee to write those. this sleep mask does not  block all the light. light come in near the nose and eye corner areas. And it&#x27;s a very uncomfortable silky feeling. don&#x27;t buy this! ...i used it only 3 times...only when i had no choice b/c it was so bright at night..but it&#x27;s cost too much for this quality.. better try it in store and then buy it if you want..not just by looking at reviews and a picture</li>
    <li> My husband suffers from terrible insomnia and is extremely sensitive to light. I got him his first sleep mask a few years ago and it really helped him stay asleep even with the morning light streaming in our windows. He lost his sleep mask while we were traveling and really suffered for it. I couldn&#x27;t find one exactly like his old one, but the Sleepmaster looked comfortable and I ordered it. It was waiting for us when we got home. My husband is thrilled with this sleep mask. It is cool and comfortable. It doesn&#x27;t interfere with natural sleep and accommodates sleep movements without shifting position or pulling. He wakes up feeling rested and restored and I don&#x27;t have to live with a morning grouch. [[ASIN:B0015NZ6FK Revolutionary, Patented SLEEP MASTER Sleep Mask]]</li>
    <li> When I first bought this, I would have given it four stars.  It blocks light very well.  I didn&#x27;t have the problem of light leaking in around the nose that some people have described.  It&#x27;s soft and comfortable, too.  I would have removed a star only for the silly marketing, since it doesn&#x27;t do some of the things it claims--it doesn&#x27;t muffle noise any better than any other piece of cloth, and of course it doesn&#x27;t keep styled hair in place (I have no idea what they were thinking with that one).  Aside from the tangential claims, though, it was a fine mask which did what it was supposed to do--blocked light.  Finally, I could sleep while my husband kept using his laptop.    Now, having owned it a while, I&#x27;ve noticed a bigger problem.  After I take it off, I have blurry vision for a while.  I don&#x27;t mean just a few minutes; I mean half an hour to an hour.  It seems to last a smidgen longer each time.    I would guess that this is from the mask pressing on my eyes.  If I wore it more loosely, I might be spared the eye pressure, but enough light would leak in that there&#x27;d be little point in wearing it.    I&#x27;ll continue to use it, but I&#x27;m shopping for a better one.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is extremely soft. I barely felt it on my face. Also I could arrange in on my face so I saw absolutely no light. The ear plugs which accompanied the product were also very effective. I would encourage those traveling to purchase this produce. You will be pleased with your purchase.</li>
    <li> The masc works well blocking the light, but the claim that is blocks the sound is a pure baloney. Good</li>
    <li> This mask is the best EVER! I cant and won&#x27;t live without it! So plush and perfect for plane rides, bright rooms or daytime naps! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I love my sleep masks but some can bother the tops of your ears or leak light next to your nose. This mask is very comfortable, blocks the light plus muffles sounds. Once you put it on and settle in, you dont need to think about it anymore.  Perfect mask. I love it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband who works 2nd shift.  He likes it a lot, it does a great job of blocking out the light and muffling sound a bit, but it gets very hot so he often has to switch back to his smaller sleep mask.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice slick fabric so it doesn&#x27;t get stuck on the pillow and twist around when you move while sleeping!  Nice velcro closure in back.  Really blocks out the light!!</li>
    <li> 100% satisfied. I recommend this mask which I&#x27;ve been using for about a year. Recently, bought a second, for when one gets lost in the night, I can find the other where I keep them attached to the bedpost</li>
    <li> It blocks the light out well but it also covered the ear which makes it less comfortable especially if you are a side sleeper</li>
    <li> I love this Sleeping mask, but it said it would block out noise, which it does not block out noise. However, I love it how it covers your face, and it does not have a strap in the back.</li>
    <li> This is a very comfortable sleep mask when you first put it on. The material is cool and feels great. The size covers so much area that no light gets in really.  However, I often woke up in the middle of the night while wearing this, sweating under the mask.  That made it very uncomfortable, interrupted my sleep, and made this not a good option for me.  I read other reviews that said it was too hot and I should have listened.  I won&#x27;t be buying a new one.  It&#x27;s in my garbage can now.</li>
    <li> I have the return label printed on this poorly designed excuse for a sleep mask and am trying to write this review through a haze of eye ointment.&lt;br /&gt;- mask is made of satin and is completely flat across the eyes - difficult to open eyes if tight, mask slides extremely easily if loose.&lt;br /&gt;- sleeping on my right side these past two nights, I awoke with some discomfort in my right eye, due to the mask slipping and either leaving my eye open to dry out or open to have the mask contact my bare eyeball. Not too bad previous nights but absolutely unbearable last night, even after the application of extreme dry eye gel.&lt;br /&gt;- mask&#x27;s sliding also lets in much more light along the bottom edge and around the nose&lt;br /&gt;- mask fit around the nose is poor, light leaks whether it is centered or not&lt;br /&gt;- sound blocking ability of sides is nil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eye hurts, I&#x27;m not a happy customer and I paid over $25 for this loser of a sleep mask. The tempurpedic pressed on my nose but it has splendid eye cups so I&#x27;m returning to it as I continue to shop for a mask of comfort and no light leakage.</li>
    <li> Some reviewers say this is overpriced, but that&#x27;s capitalism for you. I have several eye masks and I was reluctant to spend $25 but this is now the mask I use. I also have a gel eye mask which is great  if you want hot or cold, but for sleeping this one is the oat comfortable.</li>
    <li> WHat more do you need, really? :) I like this mask, it&#x27;s not tight, it definitely blocks the light out and it is soft to the skin. I use it for my daily naps on the weekends.</li>
    <li> This is AWESOME! Comfortable and works perfectly. Much better than any other I&#x27;ve been able to find, well worth the higher price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;M a nurse, work occasional nights and wouldn&#x27;t be able to sleep without this.  Stay in place, soft, nice and large.  Like them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d tried sleep masks before, but always took them off in my sleep.  This one is very comfortable, and it does exactly what I want.  I don&#x27;t have a great curtain situation, and it&#x27;s easier to buy a sleep mask than fix that problem -- now when I wake up on Saturdays, I have no idea what time it is, because I can&#x27;t tell if the sun is out or not till I lift the mask.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this mask because I have previously thrown away 4 masks due to broken elastic bands.  This one seemed like it may be more durable and resolve my broken band problem.  It&#x27;s comfortable and does an average job of blocking out the light.  It does not block out sound.  It does fall off my head during the night which may resolve if I tighten it but I prefer not to as I don&#x27;t care if I have to put it back on when I wake.  I have stuck it in the washing machine (though I&#x27;m not sure you are supposed to) and it has come out okay.  For me it was worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> Fabric starts fraying very quickly.  Not for daily use unless you plan to buy a new one every month.</li>
    <li> Comfortable and blocks out the light but the Material isn&#x27;t breathable. I frequently wake up and the mask is damp.</li>
    <li> Very soft and comfortable.  You don&#x27;t even realize it is on.  Can&#x27;t sleep in the morning without it.</li>
    <li> Product arrived promptly and was packaged well.  Very happy with this purchase.  My lady does not use it as often as I was hoping.</li>
    <li> Love love love it!  It is so soft and is the only mask out of several that I have tried that stays in place. It is so comfortable I don&#x27;t even notice it and it lets me sleep all night! Before, the light from the street lamps would bother me and now i can go to sleep without sensing the light. Thank you so much for a great sleep mask!</li>
    <li> Got this because I have been looking for a good sleep mask. This is far better than other sleep masks out there, it does block the light pretty good, it&#x27;s snug and comfortable, the silk lining is nice against your face, so it&#x27;s comfortable to sleep. I like that it is wide and wraps around your head so it doesn&#x27;t move around during your sleep. Other sleep masks I&#x27;ve worn, the eye part would be on the side of my head. The wrap is a velcro, so you can adjust it to fit, not an elastic wrap like some. Overall this is a great mask</li>
    <li> This is the perfect sleep mask. It blocks out the light and is super comfortable. Other sleep masks tend to irritate my ears because of the elastic but this is perfect and helps muffle noise too. It says to handwash, but I&#x27;ve machine washed it a couple of times with no problem. Love it!</li>
    <li> Yeah I like it. A lot. It&#x27;s very comfortable to wear and it fits very nicely. There isn&#x27;t much of a leak and you can tighten it as much as you want with velcro.</li>
    <li> Gets hot, doesn&#x27;t filter out any sound.</li>
    <li> ...it does not stay on at night, It was always on the floor or on the bed somewhere when I woke up.    Its too warm to wear in the summer.    It pushes against your eyes too much which means it does not allow for Rapid Eye Movement (REM).</li>
    <li> Wow - am so happy with this item &amp; company.  Shipping was very quick.  I have used it twice now and what a difference in the quality/comfort/fit vs the eyecovers i had been using.  I work late nights, and even with shades drawn, the light creeps through, but have slept so well without disturbance.  And it is co comfortable too.  THANKS for the quality product at a fair price!</li>
    <li> The mask feels comfortable but when you turn your head the mask stays put and the satin fabric allows your head to turn so that means having to readjust your mask every so often. I have used the tempurpedic mask for the last five years + and this is more comfortable. I am not sure would get another as it needs some way to stay in place on your head! It keeps most of the light out and has a slit where your nose goes instead of being moulded around it.</li>
    <li> I have used many eye masks trying to find the perfect one. This one is it! It is so soft and comforting. The large size keeps light out even if it slips some. I love it. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
    <li> Not that comfortable and moves a lot when sleeping so let&#x27;s light in. If u tighten it then it will be very uncomfortable for your eyes.  Would recommend trying something else</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a night worker so it is important to me to have the light blocked. For awhile I had my windows blacked out but got tired of that so went to getting a mask.  This mask blocked the light for a few days but then the flaps at the nose got loose and it shifts in your sleep so then the light leaks in at the nose. It feels comfortable at my eyes also in my opinion. I think that is the tough thing about a mask because if it shuts out light it may be tight on your eyes.  Good thing I like about the mask is that the material is comfortable to sleep in and it doesn&#x27;t impede side sleeping as some other masks do. (I have been using this in the winter so not sure how it would work in hotter climates as other&#x27;s have stated.) Also it covers your ears and muffles the sound somewhat without crunching your ears.  If I were to redesign this I would put a flap overlapping at the nose so it doesn&#x27;t leak light in. (I&#x27;m thinking about sewing a flap to take care of this problem since I like the mask otherwise.)  Recommend it but don&#x27;t expect it to totally block out the light if you are sleeping in a day lighted room.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, but have used it myself.  It is extraordinarily comfortable and does not interfere with my CPAP mask (sleep apnea).  This mask is so comfortable I hardly know I have it on, except that I sleep in the daytime in absolute darkness.  No pressure points and it is made of slick material that does not resist moving against the pillowcase.  I just can&#x27;t recommend this strongly enough.  It is worth every penny I spent on it.  Get it.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This mask is very comfortable and easy to travel with.  Also, it&#x27;s safe to machine wash on the delicate cycle.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on all the positive reviews and when I got it, I immediately realized it was uncomfortable to wear and I found it almost impossible to sleep while wearing it.  Seriously, what&#x27;s the deal with the price? I figured it was worth spending extra for something of better quality but I was wrong about that too.  The design is poor just like several other people mentioned and for what you&#x27;re getting it&#x27;s not worth the 20 something dollars.  I would imagine the business model for this company is based on the one time purchase at a high price from naive consumers with no intention of any follow up business afterwards. Oh and other people have mentioned that most of the positive reviews are from people associated with the company in some way, after having bought the product and used it, I find that theory to be highly plausible.  I had a friend who worked for a marketing company that paid him to write  good reviews and post good comments about various products on different websites.  My advice would be to take to the 20+ dollars you were going to spend on this item and offer to overpay for something you know is worth only about 5-10 dollars.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase as I left one behind at a hotel on travel.  I can&#x27;t sleep with out it and its the best mask I&#x27;ve used so far. The Velcro makes it easily adjustable and the fabric feels cool. Best of all, there are no spaces where light can sneak in and it is comfortable to wear.  It covers your ears reducing sound a bit so it helps if you&#x27;re a light sleeper.</li>
    <li> I wear this in lieu of a separate mask and ear plugs.  It&#x27;s all-in-one and I no longer have the weird lines in my face when I wake.</li>
    <li> So comfy.  Works great.</li>
    <li> I work overnights and was bought this to try to keep having to make my room into a cave. Very comfortable, stays on great and if you use ear plugs it helps to hold them in</li>
    <li> I keep using this over night. Extremely comfortable</li>
    <li> Soft, comfortable and easily adjustable. I&#x27;ve been getting a much better night&#x27;s sleep and haven&#x27;t torn it off in discomfort yet. Large coverage area also adds the protection from sleep wrinkles which is an added plus.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to hand wash with cold water and air dry. It stays fairly cool and doesn&#x27;t cause me to sweat.</li>
    <li> I love to have my eyes AND ears covered to sleep.  Pulling the covers over my head leaves my breathing limited.  :)  This mask is my perfect solution.</li>
    <li> This is BY FAR the most comfortable sleep mask I&#x27;ve owned! It&#x27;s well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried the cheaper masks; don&#x27;t waste your time or money with those. Buy the SleepMaster!</li>
    <li> my partner is very sensitive to light in the bedroom, whereas i like to have sunshine in the morning to wake up to.  this mask proved a great solution to both our problems:  he can sleep in, i can wake up with daylight.  my partner had tried other sleeping masks and none were comfortable enough to wear for prolonged periods of time.  he doesn&#x27;t sleep with this on all night, but it&#x27;s comfortable for many hours.  the only draw back is the loudness of the velcro, which wakes me up--but there&#x27;s an easy fix for that:  he opens it before i go to sleep.</li>
    <li> My favorite thing ever...</li>
    <li> The nice wide band didn&#x27;t mess up my &#x27;do too much, not that I cared.  But it was an added bonus.  Got some shut eye on a long flight.</li>
    <li> I think the design of the front part of the mask is great.  It blocks out light more than other masks that I&#x27;ve tried and is very comfortable overall, but the problem lies at the back of the mask, where the two back ends of the mask, which are covered in Velcro, overlap.  All that material is pretty noticeable when you try to lie on your back.  Depending on how much this bothers you, you might find this an unbearable flaw.  I&#x27;ve been using it to cover my face without fastening the Velcro on the back just so that it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> probably the best eye mask you are going to find. it doesn&#x27;t fully cover my ears though like I thought I would, but maybe I have low ears? lol it does slide up and down unless I put it really tight on my head and that&#x27;s uncomfortable to me, maybe if it had a snap closure instead it would be less likely to do that? I do like it better than the elastic they have on normal eye masks though. that being said,  I think it might be a little pricey for a piece of fabric.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my significant other. Light obfuscation provides the sublime environment necessary to a restfull sleep.  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> this works great, and is super comfortable. i have a hard time getting to sleep, but this is so comfortable it doesnt matter in the slightest. it stays put all night even though i toss and turn about, and it 100% keeps the light out. as a bonus there are some of the soft dense foam earplugs. i have only seen them used when firing firearms and in industrial settings, and as disposable one time use.they are actually quite comfortable for sleeping as they are so pliable. they dont last too long, but i have slept on couches at my friends house whilst 5 or 6 people are running around in the room making breakfast, watching tv, chatting, and playing video games. i was none the wiser till the told me when i woke up that they were trying to make as much noise as possible (within reason) to wake me up.</li>
    <li> My husband leaves tv on and I need quiet and no light, so with my ear plugs and sleep master it works great. the ear plugs they give you dont work. I recommend these blue earplugs that have a playdough texture. No the playdough doesnt work :)</li>
    <li> I left a three word description the last time out.  I&#x27;ve read some of the thirteen hundred reviews and I&#x27;m no rocket scientist.  I&#x27;m a working man.  I remember seeing these things on actors in movies.  The Thin Man comes to mind, and they are almost always portrayed as being worn by some upper crusty type stiff.  I wear them to get a good night&#x27;s sleep.  Does the brightness of the late summer nights affect your sleep?  Do you need complete darkness to ease you off to nighty night.  C&#x27;mon we&#x27;re grownups,  most of us deserve Oscars for our performance during our working lives.  Are your nerves frayed by the end of the day,  mine are.  Do you simply not want to walk around cranky all damn day and wonder what the heck is going on.  Maybe you&#x27;re not sleeping well.  It&#x27;s OK if children are cranky,  what about adults?  Get some sleep.  You don&#x27;t need to be some hot shot to wear a sleeping mask,  you&#x27;re not putting on airs wearing these masks.  You&#x27;re trying to keep your sanity and get some rest.  Do yourself a favor and get these things,  they work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no vested interest in this company,  or any other.  I&#x27;m just trying to convince a few folks to be less cranky.  I&#x27;m sure you do deserve an Oscar by the way.</li>
    <li> Feels great nice to block light not so good for sound, every morning it is on the floor though yikes!&lt;br /&gt;Still hear the baby!!!!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what my sister in law wanted for Christmas. She works third shift, and claims it really does help her sleep better during the daylight hours.</li>
    <li> I loved this mask when I first started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after a few weeks, found it a bit claustrophobic and discovered I did not like having my ears covered,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask sometimes felt confining and warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use it from time to time when I really need to block out the world</li>
    <li> I am a very light sleeper and this sleep mask has become the  best chance of a good night sleep that have ever used. It is larger than  expected and that may be why it works so well. It covers completely and because it is so soft it feels great all night. It does not shift around and also prevents ear plugs from becoming dislodged. Also; I appreciate that it can be washed. Will definitely buy another when needed.</li>
    <li> I have recently been hired for my first graveyard shift, and I have to sleep during the day. This mask not only blocks out the light, but helps attenuate noise. Unlike other masks that fail to block out much light and are very uncomfortable this one is lightweight and there are no irritating elastic bands.</li>
    <li> i work nights, have not flashes, chronic headaches and sleep in a westerly facing bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;the sleep master mask is cool to touch, blocks the light (after a little time spent adjusting) and is unobtrusive during sleep.  additionally, although i have no objective data to prove this, my headaches have decreased in frequency/duration and intensity (perhaps the increased quality/quantity of sleep?)&lt;br /&gt;would recommend----actually, HAVE recommended--this product to friends/co-workers.</li>
    <li> Excellent sleep mask! It blocks out all light and wraps comfortably around your head, so it doesn&#x27;t slide off or move as you roll over, and since it wraps gently around your head/ears it filters out most noise as well!. A great product and well worth the price. I&#x27;m an insomniac and my work keeps me going through the night, so I can only sleep during the mid afternoon til evening hours. This product easily beats out the 4 others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> TOO HOT! Yes it is silky, but it is too warm. Like wearing a winter ear cover headband thingy to bed. And it slides up and down. Hard to get a good fit. Maybe for the winter or cold weather. I did not like it. I have an average head and on the standard setting it fit alright. Plenty of room to make it more snug or more loose.</li>
    <li> Earlier this year (2013) I was working the overnight shift so I slept during the day. This sleep mask worked really well. It allowed me to sleep through the day without being disturbed by sunlight or passing traffic.</li>
    <li> I live in a big city, so the night sky doesn&#x27;t get very dark. I was having a hard time falling asleep because even with the lights off and the blinds closed there was light entering my room. (I guess I need it to be pitch black to sleep, haha). This mask was such a great investment. I noticed the difference right away. It&#x27;s comfy, easy to wash, adjustable, and really does block out light.</li>
    <li> Finally I can sleep in, even when the morning sun shines through the window!  This eye mask is so much better than the others I&#x27;ve had.  The other ones always let light in on the sides and around the nose.</li>
    <li> Really cheap made, though it was just me until it fell apart now it is just trash.</li>
    <li> A+ THANK YOU! EXCELLENT PRODUCT. I purchased this for my husband and he is IN LOVE with his new sleep mask. He uses this in conjunction with his CPAP machine and sleeps like a baby. He says absolutely no light filters through and the material is soft and comfortable.</li>
    <li> A little large, but very comfortable</li>
    <li> Great product! This was a replacement for the one our dog chewed up. My husband can&#x27;t live without this sleep mask. He says it&#x27;s the best sleep mask he&#x27;s ever used. Nice and soft and comfortable to sleep in. Does what it&#x27;s suppose to do. Also really like the fact that it&#x27;s washable</li>
    <li> I work on a computer all day and suffer from headaches. This helps my eyes tremendously. Often in the morning I find it somewhere in my sheets (I&#x27;m a rough sleeper) but it helps do the hardest job- falling asleep.</li>
    <li> I only tried this once- should have sent it back.  The mask seems to press on my eyes and feels claustrophic to me.  Sorry but I can not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is superior to the other top rated ones I ordered on Amazon previously. The fact that the design has a high enough clearance for the nose means that light doesn&#x27;t get in where your nose would otherwise be pushing up the mask below your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The material is very soft and pleasant on the face. The velcro closure is perhaps not my first choice, because if you have to adjust it there is that horrible loud noise, but it is easy to fit to your head and it hasn&#x27;t been a problem getting caught in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Soft on the face, comfortable the night through. And I get to read in bed without worrying about keeping my wife awake!</li>
    <li> I wear this sleep mask every night! THank you for fast shipping and a very quality item. I have never used a sleep mask that blocks out the light so well and is so comfortable! I can&#x27;t sleep without it! I own about 5 or 6 sleep masks and have always had trouble balancing out comfort with light blocking ability. I&#x27;ve been through tons of Amazon reviews and I&#x27;m happy I finally landed on the best one that blocks light and is incredibly comfortable. I would wear the mask during the day if I could!! I will never buy any other mask and I recommend this one to everyone!</li>
    <li> I really like this sleep mask. I do not wake up whem my husband comes in the room anymore so i sleep through the night. The only problem i have with this mask is if I have it on a little too tight it puts pressure on my eyes and I wake up blurry.  It usually takes about a half an hour or so for my eyes to completely focus again. Other than that I love it.</li>
    <li> This is a comfortable sleep mask. It silky lightly padded and larger than most so less light creeps in. There&#x27;s velcro for size adjustments so be care with your hair. I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this about 9 months ago and love it. I have tried other masks because they were less expensive. I felt this mask was pricey. However, the other masks all eventually bothered me. The would scratch my face, make me sweat, pull my hair, not keep the light out, etc. This mask stays in place and keeps the light out but the best part is that it is gentle on your skin. I love it. It is definitely worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> This is the best !  If you are thinking about buying an eye mask, buy this one.  Comfortable and lasts!</li>
    <li> My order was expedited in a very timely fashion.  The customer service is excellent because they work hard to make sure customers are well taken care of. I feel like I&#x27;m being rewarded for being a good customer. If all companies cared like they do, then everyone would be very happy and satisfied. This is an excellent product - it is comfortable, durable, and washable!</li>
    <li> Goot fit, satin is so nice and cool. Very effective at blocking light. Expensive for what it is though. Sound muffling is very slight, but I like the padded sides better than most strap designs. I like it better than the dream essentials model. Like any sleep mask, can slip off, but it does fit under my cpap apparatus (optilife nose pillow).  Not revolutionary, but gets the job done.</li>
    <li> The sleep mask is even better than I expected from reading the reviews. It&#x27;s very soft and completely blocks out all light. It&#x27;s wider than average which allows it to cover my cheeks and does not leave creases on my face as others have.</li>
    <li> The mask works great unless you want to sleep on your face.It takes some getting used to when feelin the pressure on your eyelids.My wife has no problems however.It must be a guy thing.</li>
    <li> It came early! AND I love, love, LOVE it. I have taken prescription and non scripts, herbals, white noise nature sounds, and other masks. This, for a week straight since I got it, has made me get to sleep fast and stay asleep. I get a good rest. One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
    <li> This mask is extremely comfortable, much more so than the cheaper versions I&#x27;ve tried.  It is great for sleeping during the day or at night in an environment that is not completely quiet or dark.  I&#x27;ve also found it works much better than those masks they hand out on some international flights.  The sound muffling is a nice touch on noisy flights.  I highly recommend Sleep Master Sleep Mask.</li>
    <li> Over the years, my sister and I have confirmed we apparently have very large heads and that has made finding a sleep mask that fit extremely difficult.  This one has been a god send. The soft body makes it easy to pack it&#x27;s broad shape completely the span of my eyes to where I can turn my reading light one and still see nothing!  Besides simply being large, the velcro allows me to size it to exactly what I consider comfortable; a feature I&#x27;ve been stunned have so much trouble finding before this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend giving this mask a try if you have been plagued with standard masks being too small.</li>
    <li> This eye mask keeps the light out. But it is soooooo bulky. I guess I&#x27;ll keep it since it does the job of keeping out light. Works great  on the airplane! Not only does it keep light out but it minimizes plane noise. I give it 3 and 1/2 star!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The mask is comfortable but too hot.  Can only use it in the winter.</li>
    <li> Very thick and cumbersome.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> My teen granddaughter sleeps in one every single night and this is one of her two favorites.  I was very skeptical when ordering it but it works great!</li>
    <li> Except the silk tends to soak up nighttime eye and face cream.... But love it regardless!</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and blocks out everything... starting to have threads coming loose after a month, though.</li>
    <li> Love this sleep mask! No elastic band to pull your hair and blocks out all light. Great customer service as well, and speedy shipping.</li>
    <li> My favorite sleep mask.</li>
    <li> Excellent light blocker</li>
    <li> A little late on my review but been using this on flights for a couple of years and love it.</li>
    <li> comfy but didn&#x27;t keep out the light</li>
    <li> I have tried all sleep masks and this is the one for me, comfortable and keeps the light out.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re trying to decide on a sleep mask, look no further, THIS is the one for YOU!!! I have used a couple others before, one cheap and one really expensive, and this one is by far the best. I did quite a bit of research before I ordered this &amp; I&#x27;m thrilled with my purchase. It makes everything pitch black, it&#x27;s very comfortable, and with the design, its even a noise reducer. I haven&#x27;t gone a single night without using it. Not sure if I could even sleep not without it! lol It&#x27;s perfect to use anywhere, at home, hotels, car rides (when you&#x27;re not driving of course! lol) planes.  I just can&#x27;t say enough about this product except ORDER IT NOW!!</li>
    <li> I love this sleep mask! It feels great, never falls off, completely blocks light and even reduces noise, which I wasn&#x27;t looking for but certainly appreciate. I&#x27;ve used other masks and eye pillows over the years, but none have been nearly as good as this one. I&#x27;m buying one for my wife, daughter, and anyone else I know who would benefit from great sleeping!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used sleep masks for several years now and this is by far the best.  I have a hard time falling asleep so using a sleep mask is the only way I&#x27;ll keep my eyes shut long enough to fall asleep.  Other masks are either too tight and cause blurry vision or too loose and don&#x27;t block out light.  This mask blocks all light (even around nose) and can be adjusted to the perfect size.  I went through a few years sick with Lyme disease and if you are familiar with the symptoms you&#x27;ll know a major one is fatigue.  I took naps every day.  I didn&#x27;t have this mask back then but I used others that weren&#x27;t as good.  Totally wish I had this one then.  It has totally improved my quality of sleep/ life.  Love it.</li>
    <li> blocks the light well. Worked wonders for protecting my eye while suffering from Bell&#x27;s Palsy</li>
    <li> The attachment in the back is very thick, to the point where it&#x27;s uncomfortable to sleep on your back when wearing these.  The bulk of it means it comes off in your sleep.  It&#x27;s fairly comfortable, just completely fails at what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Where to begin?&lt;br /&gt;Based on all the 5 star reviews, it seemed I couldn&#x27;t go wrong with this mask. It even mentioned sound blocking, which would have been nice - if there were any!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The slippery material makes it slide all over may face and soon pop totally off my head - every time!&lt;br /&gt;2. The velcro fastener in the back creates an annoying lump, making it impossible to sleep on my back.&lt;br /&gt;3. The polyester satin material lets heat build up and causes me to sweat, and irritates my ears (which are sensitive). It soon seems&lt;br /&gt;  like wearing a piece of sandpaper! If I put my hair over my ears to keep them away from the fabric the mask slides around even&lt;br /&gt;  more.&lt;br /&gt;4.  From perspiration, and any oil on my skin I suppose, it seems to release color from the cheap fabric, which looks like a black stain&lt;br /&gt;  on my pillow.&lt;br /&gt;5.  There is no detectable sound reduction!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.  Finally - and very important, Sleepmaster says their product is patented. While searching for sleep masks on Yahoo, I came across something called the &#x27;Miracle Mask&#x27; (buymiraclemask.com). It looks exactly like the Sleepmaster, and even says it reduces sound. The biggest shock is, that they are selling them for only 2 for $10! (Of course you have to pay Xtra shipping) This means you can get 2 miracle masks for about $24! My question is: if the Sleepmaster is patented as they say, how are they permitting this other company to sell a product exactly like theirs for such a cheaper price? Second, are they just selling these under another name, and undercutting the price they charge me and their other Amazon customers? I thought Amazon had some rule against that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the reasons behind my 1 star rating for this product!</li>
    <li> This is my second sleep mask and I find them the most comfortable in the Caribbean  climate I live in . I use it daily for afternoon nap no matter how bright the sun is !!  Patricia Morey</li>
    <li> It seems like these days blackout curtains are a luxury at the average hotel. I seem to be the lucky one to get windows facing the parking lot... After suffering through nights where I didn&#x27;t get the rest I needed, it was time to get a sleep mask. Quality was a major factor in the decision process... here&#x27;s why I LOVE LOVE LOVE my SLEEP MASTER Sleep Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - Blackout even during the day. Exactly what I want, no light seeps through, even if I move around. Even if the mask is off-centered, there is a lot of extra mask to blackout the light. I first put it on just to try with lights on during daylight hours and it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 - No rubber band. The velcro is a great touch. No worries about snap backs, over stretching the rubber band (I have a large head), losing the rubber band, hair/ear pinching due to the rubber band, etc... The mask stays in the exact way you put it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 - Very soft, cool, and when it&#x27;s on, you know it&#x27;s on (not tight mind you).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great... something I wish I had this for when I was on the road before, but now I have it and will use it out when I need it. Thanks so much for making this product.</li>
    <li> It is like wearing a satin helmet to bed and slips right off the first time you roll over. I tried it for a week and didn&#x27;t wake up once in the morning (when I actually need) still affixed. It is also really, really hot. It reminds me of the helmet Luke Skywalker wore during lightsaber practice. I just returned it.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it!  Very comfy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because i work late into the night and sometimes just can not get to sleep straight after work, making bed time close to sunrise. If the sunrises before i get myself into deep sleep it can be very difficult to get myself there. I thought a sleeping mask was a perfect solution and bought this was as my first because of so many high reviews. I am not impressed. I sleep on my side and its bulky, i can not get comfortable with it on. Also when adjusting myself it slides around so that i have to re-adjust it before settling down. I have only been able to have a full nights sleep with it on one time. Every other time i rip it off in frustration. Others found it to be fabulous but i just don&#x27;t see what is so great about it. The only good thing was when it did align with my face properly it blocked out the light really well.</li>
    <li> Works as described. Very soft and comfortable to the touch. Feels nice when wrapped around the head, not constricting at all. Speedy service thanks.</li>
    <li> wow what to say really good, comfortable and more comfortable</li>
    <li> Looking forward to trying this mask out. Willing to try any NATURAL ways to get some deep, consistent sleep. Like the fact that it&#x27;s soft silk, and, like someone else commented, the fact that it wont cut into the back of my head after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B009FU3DZK Sleep Yourself Beautiful - The Anti Aging Power Of Sleep.

    <li> I purchased this sleep mask for my husband who works the night shift. He had been having a lot of trouble  falling asleep, and staying asleep during the day. We tried room darkening shades, a white noise machine,  and even sleep aides. Nothing worked. That is until he started wearing the Sleep Master sleep mask. He  received a very sound, and complete 71/2-8 hour sleep, the first time using the mask. He has been wearing  it a whole week now, and it Really does work! All those hundreds of reviews you&#x27;ve read, are the real deal.  At first I was hesitant because of the price, but with the Amazon guarantee, and being at my whits end, it  was worth truing. Well it was money well spent. I now have a well rested,happy &amp; healthy husband again. I   recommend this product to anyone with sleeping problems.You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love this eye mask, can&#x27;t sleep without it.&lt;br /&gt;First purchased for noise reduction for flying but I use it at&lt;br /&gt;Home all the time.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about the price since it&#x27;s rather high for a piece of cloth, but in the end I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase. For those that have tried several sleepmasks over the years, they know it&#x27;s actually hard to find one that completely blocks out the light, however stupid that sounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sleep Master is a substantial piece of material that fits comfortably around the head and easily blocks out the light. It does come off in the night on occasion, but it&#x27;s easy to slip back on in in the dark (the nose slot makes it easy to detect which side is down).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, it doesn&#x27;t block out sound any better, BUT it does come with two of the BEST earplugs I&#x27;ve ever used. They completely block out any noise and they don&#x27;t seem to lose their power like other earplugs because they&#x27;re made of a rubbery material that returns to its original form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, you&#x27;re most likely not going to find a better product for a better value. Plus, they&#x27;re willing to offer a refund if you&#x27;re unhappy, so I&#x27;d take the risk. They&#x27;re very friendly and eager to please their customers, which is why I&#x27;m taking the time to write this review. I say go for it!</li>
    <li> I needed something like this for the winter, when it is cold in my room, and my sinuses ofter bother me as a result.  This mask is warm, fits well, is soft, feels great, covers my ears as well.  Love it.  would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I will start working nights as a nurse in a few weeks, and wanted to make sure I could sleep as well as possible in the daytime. First of all, these are very comfortable to sleep in. They are a very soft, almost silky material. They are broad across the face and sides and this helps block light even if some slipping occurs during sleep. The material is excellent at blocking light, though this is partly due to the wearer needing to keep their eyes closed when in use. It is pretty much impossible to open your eyes while wearing the mask, which I found disconcerting at first. Oddly, I now find it comforting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also a side sleeper, and am happy to say that this mask works quite well for me. Evidently, some masks are too bulky for us side sleepers, but this one is nice and trim so it&#x27;s no problem. The wider sides don&#x27;t do much to block out noise, though the mask does come with a pair of disposable ear plugs. The sides of this are also pretty long, so unless you have a huge noggin, it should fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I balked at the price initially, but I can&#x27;t complain so far. Hopefully it holds up over time.</li>
    <li> I bought 3 different sleep masks at the same time.  All were highly rated on Amazon.  Of all three, this one is by far the best. Don&#x27;t hesitate, just buy.</li>
    <li> Maybe I have a strange sized head, I dont know. What I do know is I had to make this mask so tight to get it to stay on my head it was uncomfortable. It was pressing against my eyes and I was waking up more tired than sleeping without it.&lt;br /&gt;The fabric, like others have commented, also made my face sweat. I did not use the ear plugs because I already have some, but I know the brand very well and the ones they include are level MAX, so they are pretty stiff and I would think uncomfortable to wear for sleeping. I use the LITE version and even that is pretty stiff to have in all night long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the product is pretty good, just did not work for me. I will try another brand or style. It did block out the light pretty effectively, just not comfortably.</li>
    <li> By design, this product will inherently put pressure on the eyes. It has no second strap, and the eye area is not concave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a large gap near the nose where light is able to come through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was unable to wear this, because either it was putting pressure on my eyes or it was falling off. Other reviewers seem to like it, but for me any eye pressure whatsoever is unacceptable.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a whole lot to say, it&#x27;s pretty straightforward. This item doesn&#x27;t work for two very important reasons. 1) You can still see light through the \\&quot;nose slit\\&quot; when there&#x27;s no way I could adjust it so that I couldn&#x27;t see light through it. 2) It comes off very very easily. Every time I have tried to use it, it&#x27;s come off. Overall, it&#x27;s a totally useless piece of junk.</li>
    <li> This mask is a Great product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly this product helped me a lot to sleep&lt;br /&gt;Excellent light blocking capability and very soft&lt;br /&gt;It is also comfortable and covers the ears&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hope to to be available with move colors</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. I dont see any light and I fall asleep in minutes. Before I had a black out curtain covering my window. It feels so much better to have sunlight coming into my room before I go to sleep.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 3 or 4 different ones. This one is awesome. Haven&#x27;t really used it over a long time though to say about how it stands up over time.</li>
    <li> I Have owned several sleep masks over the years. I find I get a better night sleep when I wear one. I asked for this one as a birthday gift and have been quite pleased with it for over the last 2-3 months. It&#x27;s constructed like none others. Its soft, satiny finish covers a cushion material. At first I found it to be hot on my face but no longer experience this. The strap actually covers your ears for improved sound proofing which is no replacement for ear plugs but does make a considerable difference. Also, the velcro strips can be crossed at an angle behind your head to improve the fit to the point where almost no light can come in. My wife can be reading with the light on in bed next to me but all I see is darkness. Finally, it stays in place really well on my head through the night. It shifts somewhat but not much. If you have grown to depend on sleep masks, this one is worth the money.</li>
    <li> The Sleep Master Mask is just what I needed. I can&#x27;t tell how many times I couldn&#x27;t sleep because it was too bright. I would try to cover my head with a blanket to block out the light. The Sleep Mask completely blocks out the light and any little sounds. I love the way it huges and wraps around your head. This is a must have! I highly recommend the seller they have great customer service and ship the mask out right away!</li>
    <li> Great product, exactly as advertised. It&#x27;s soft and comfortable and blocks light well. I&#x27;m going to give a few of these as Xmas presents.</li>
    <li> 2 stars because it&#x27;s well-constructed. However, it&#x27;s bulky and slides easily. If you tighten it, it gets too hot and puts pressure on the eyes.</li>
    <li> Most comfortable sleep mask! Doesn&#x27;t damage or pull my hair at all. Doesn&#x27;t press against my eyes. Impenetrable to light. Perfectly cushioned. Doesn&#x27;t heat up too much. Helps a little for noise. Makes me look ridiculous but who cares?</li>
    <li> I explored several mask options at different prices and am very satisfied that I received excellent value.  The mask is large, perhaps over-sized compared to many. I found the large size to be an unanticipated benefit.  I move and turn often in my sleep. If the mask moves, it still fulfills its purpose, unlike others.  I&#x27;ve seen reviews that it is bulky but I found that not to be a problem.  It is comfortable and the \\&quot;bulkiness\\&quot;  allows one some flexibility to position it in the optimal comfortable spot. I&#x27;m sleeping better which is the goal, isn&#x27;t it?</li>
    <li> This is THE best sleep mask!! It is very soft and confortable and its width on the side make it very comfortable for the ears. Also blocks all light from the outside. Extremely recommended!!!</li>
    <li> This thing is much, much better than any of the usual sleep masks you can get from the airlines or in the usual airport shops. Covers the whole head and so it muffles sound better than just having ear plugs alone. Also can be adjusted to have just the right tension to stay put without squashing or pinching the head. This is gold for international flights.</li>
    <li> Because there is a light outside of my window, I need an eye mask to help me to sleep. I tried other eye masks before, most of them are too hard. Only one is just ok but it&#x27;s fade. So I just do a small research on amazon and find this mask has a high rating. Then I just bought one, I didn&#x27;t expect it will be that good before I get the real thing. Yes, it&#x27;s very soft, and the silky silk material makes me feel like i&#x27;m not wearing anything when i&#x27;m sleeping. I will absolutely recommend this eye mask to any of my friend if they need one.</li>
    <li> Not the best sleep mask. Use bedtime bless instead.</li>
    <li> The product was too expensive and it should have cost less, as in my opinion it did cost little money to make. The Sleep Mask I received is different  from the one shown on the picture and it did not help me  sleep satisfactory. I am not using it right now.</li>
    <li> Soft, cool material, blocks some sound, blocks light very effectively. I&#x27;ve machine washed this a few times &amp; let it drip dry after over 7 months its still in good shape</li>
    <li> This works better than any sleep mask I&#x27;ve tried.  It isn&#x27;t perfect - the satin material can be hot and some light can still sneak in around the nose.  However, it does a better job of keeping light out and is more comfortable than the competition.  The wide, flat adjustable closure really makes a big difference.  Elastic bands can cut into your scalp and get stuck in your hair.  Bands that are too thick make you feel like your head is resting on a rolled up towel.  The band on this mask is smooth and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really doesn&#x27;t do much to muffle noise but that&#x27;s not why I bought it, and I need to be able to hear the alarm clock anyway.  I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of years now and it&#x27;s still holding up.  The satin is a bit fuzzy but other than that it&#x27;s in great shape.  It washes well with cold water on gentle and I let it hang dry to extend the life of the fabric.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried it twice and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than a free sleep mask you get on a plane, at least not better than the better ones you get in business class...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quite big and cumbersome and actually blocks out less light than normal masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ear muffling just makes it get in the way rather than really add much to sleep quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the lavender is a bit &#x27;whatever&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall not convinced and annoyed at the hyperbole in the title.</li>
    <li> I really do like this sleep mask! The quality is excellent, and the material is so silky soft. It&#x27;s very comfortable.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use this until last night-several months after I bought it, although I bought it a few months ago, just to have it ready when I would need it-didn&#x27;t need to use it until after daylight savings time and light starting waking me up.&lt;br /&gt;I promised I&#x27;d write a review when I used it.Here is said review!&lt;br /&gt;I love this product!  It is fantastic, by far the best sleep mask I&#x27;ve ever used! It&#x27;s unobtrusive, sleek &amp; silky and does not push against my eyes or eyelashes like others have. The Velcro on the back does not bother my head at all. I like the division in the middle (between each side allowing space for the nose) which allows it to be flexible.&lt;br /&gt;I will never use a different one!&lt;br /&gt;I rarely over-enthuse over a product, so you can be sure I&#x27;m sincere here!&lt;br /&gt;I may order another one soon just to make sure I always have one in case the first one gets lost or even if it&#x27;s drying after washing.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint if you can call it one, is with the included earplugs. They are not the best by my experience. If I need to shut out noise, I use foam ones, which expand much better than these soft rubbery ones. I think the sleep mask should be sold alone and people can choose their own earplugs, if needed. But yes, the wide soft straps will help keep the earplugs from getting &amp;#34;lost&amp;#34; if they should fall out.&lt;br /&gt;Once again, a TERRIFIC product!</li>
    <li> Does the job and is comfortable.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Had to stay in the hospital and it helped so much when trying to get some rest. Would recommend to anyone wanting a good sleep mask that does what it is suppose to.</li>
    <li> I am a night worker and for the longest time have had trouble getting sleep during the day.  Even when I did the quality of the sleep seemed to be lackluster.  I chose this mask because I liked the design of having good eye cover and the addition of ear cover as well.  It cost a bit more than other masks but it was worth every bit.  First thing I noticed was that it was very comfortable.  It wasn&#x27;t something that felt like I had to adjust to wearing.  It doesn&#x27;t get hot or stuffy when wearing it during any sleep session under normal temperatures.  Cover is 99%, you can notice a hairline breech of light from the bottom around the contours of the nose, so it may depend on the shape of your nose.  However it&#x27;s unnoticeable when you&#x27;re sleeping, at least for me it wasn&#x27;t.  The cover for the ears is a nice touch, it doesn&#x27;t block sound, but simply muffles sound to make them less disruptive the further away the sound is, but making close sounds like an alarm clock still effective in waking you up.  It does come with ear plugs if you need them, I&#x27;ve never had to use them so I can&#x27;t comment on how well they work in comparison to other ear plugs or how they perform in addition to the covering.  All in all this was the best purchase I ever made in investing in better sleep.  The quality of sleep has improved to levels of satisfaction and am able to feel pretty close to that of having a REAL good nights sleep.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Soft, blacks out the light. But pushes down on my eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I was expecting something great for my $25 sleep mask. Boy was I mistaken. I hate to give a laundry list of issues, but with this item, I can&#x27;t help but do just that. So, here goes:&lt;br /&gt;1) This mask doe *NOT* block out light. I repeat...it is *NOT* opaque! Lying in bed with the mask on, face towards the bed lamp on the other side of the bed, open my eyes, there is a distinct blue glow. And the bed lamp isn&#x27;t very bright! So no. This mask will not give you cave darkness. Unlike every other mask I have ever used, this one does *NOT* block light&lt;br /&gt;2) The stitching of the mask where it goes over the bridge of the nose is rough and irritating. If worn in a manner that is deemed comfortable, the stitching will rub against the bridge of your nose.&lt;br /&gt;3) This is perhaps one of my biggest gripes. It creates too much pressure on your eyeballs. Sure, you can adjust the tightness by messing with the velcro closure. But if you make it too loose, it will slip off your head. If you make it too tight, the mask will push against your eyes. Even if you keep it loose, the mask will still push against your eyes. I believe this is a design flaw of the mask. If you look where the velcro strips are, you will notice that it is in line with where your eyes would be. This causes the mask to crease at that point and put undue pressure on your eyes. Unlike cheaper masks that have pockets to prevent the mask from touching your eyes, this more expensive mask does not.&lt;br /&gt;4) It&#x27;s huge! This is a plus as well as a minus. It&#x27;s a plus because if the mask does slip a little, it will keep spears of light from getting through the edges. It&#x27;s a minus because no matter how you sleep, movement of your head will cause the mask to slip. There is no avoiding it. This mask will *NOT* stay where you put it. And most likely, when you wake up the next morning, you will probably not be wearing the mask anymore.&lt;br /&gt;4) I don&#x27;t get why this is patented. Is it because it claims to reduce noise? Puh-leze! Really? Is that little strip of cloth in some way supposed to block sound? I don&#x27;t feel that there is anything there other than the cloth material that is present in the rest of the sleep mask. It&#x27;s not as if there are sound deadeners embedded in the sleep mask...foam cups or something...nope...it&#x27;s just the cloth that extends over your ears..nothing more...there is nothing special about this...wrap a towel around your head and you will get a better sound deadener!&lt;br /&gt;5) That material that covers the ears, in fact *AMPLIFIES* noise! The material that covers the ears is part of the sleep mask as a whole! So if you lie on your stomach and the front of the mask brushes your pillow, this sound is transferred in an amplified manner to the material that covers your ears and is considerably louder than if it didn&#x27;t cover your ears at all. Same for if you sleep on your back. Any movement where the mask rubs against the pillow or blanket will transfer that noise in an amplified manner to your ears...It sounds like a record scratching it&#x27;s so loud!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did like about this thing is that it doesn&#x27;t skimp on material. My biggest problem with sleep masks is that it makes it extremely dark behind the mask. Then when you move, an edge may open up and a spear of light will stab through into this darkness and in your dark adjusted eyes, cause undue pain. This sleep mask is so large, that it if very difficult for it to move so extremely so that it will allow spears of light in. Unfortunately, because it is not opaque, you cannot get &amp;#34;cave darkness&amp;#34; inside the mask. There will always be a blue glow that you can clearly see with your eyes open or closed when wearing the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sleep mask makes a valiant attempt to solve a problem, but fails on all of them.&lt;br /&gt;What it would take to be the perfect sleep mask?&lt;br /&gt;1) eye cups. Keep the material off of my eyes&lt;br /&gt;2) use elastic for the straps&lt;br /&gt;3) allow the elastic to be adjustable not only for size but for where it is to be positioned on the actual sleep mask&lt;br /&gt;4) Put some kind of closed-cell foam in the cloth section that covers the ears&lt;br /&gt;5) make the material that covers the ears out of ultra suede of something similar that doesn&#x27;t transfer sound so easily.&lt;br /&gt;6) There is *NO* reason the stitching has to be on the edge of this thing...The stitching can be wrapped around and stitched to the front of the sleep mask. Yeah, it won&#x27;t look as pretty, but this is not a beauty pageant, we&#x27;re trying to get some sleep here!</li>
    <li> It feels weird on the back of the head it gets bulky, I have to sleep on the side..</li>
    <li> The design is great but I do not like the material is made as I do not think is fine on the skin for long use and to make it perfect I would have made the eye space inside a bit hollow to improve it.</li>
    <li> This is extremely comfortable.  Really like a cozy pillow for your eyes.  Blocks light really well and seems to hold up well too.  Best thing about it is that I use a CPAP mask and this really helps keep that mask secure and avoid air leaks.  I love it.  Only thing negative to say is that I like to be a little on the chilly side at night and this keeps my face from being cool which is fine during this winter season, but when it warms up, may not be good for me.  That issue may be a positive though for others.  Price would be better at 10 to 15 bucks, rather than over $20, but either way, I really like this product and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and does the job better then others I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
    <li> I was working the graveyard shift for a good 6 months, so a well crafted sleep mask was something I needed.  I burned through a couple other cheaper ones in a few weeks and decided to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s kind of expensive for a sleep mask, but I love it.  It&#x27;s comfortable, stays in place well, doesn&#x27;t bug my eyes, and is washable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know about you guys &amp; gals, but I sweat when I sleep sometimes.  There&#x27;s nothing worse than trying to sleep with a stinky head ornament.  You end up in a world of darkness and funk.  Many of these other eye covers will not be the same after a single wash, but this one is well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; eye masks is the straps on the sides.  They always wear out or are difficult to adjust...too tight and your eyes hurt.  Too loose and daylight comes screeching in like eagle talons just when you&#x27;re at that &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; part of your dream.  This one has no straps...nothing to wear out.  It&#x27;s easily adjustable with a velcro portion at the back.  Some people seem to have problems with the way it&#x27;s designed (the way it fits on or over the ears), but I never had an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The material is a silk feeling stuff and is very soft against your skin...the stuff you think would make perfect sheets until you slide off your bed at inopportune times &amp; speeds.  It doesn&#x27;t slide off my face like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again.</li>
    <li> My sister works nights and I got this for her.  She loves it.  It&#x27;s pretty soft.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask works perfectly. I&#x27;ve bought two now because I can find no fault with it and my wife likes to use it as well. I always take it with me when I travel as well, it doesnt get wrinkled up either for some reason.</li>
    <li> It worth what you pay.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;My order was processed quickly with the item arriving in a timely   manner in the condition described by seller. Based on this experience, I   would purchase from this seller again and would recommend them to   others.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> The Sleep master sleep mask is a must for everyone! If you awake even once during the night, you increase the  risk of illnesses such as cancer, diabetes, Parkinson&#x27;s, Alzheimer&#x27;s, MS, GI disorders, depression, lowered immune system and hormone levels, memory loss and weight gain. This product will insure complete darkness which is critical in an uninterrupted nights sleep. The shipping is prompt and the customer service is impeccable if there is any issue. Order now!</li>
    <li> Works  well &amp; comfortable</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had other sleep masks, but none this comfortable or one that actually helps lessen noise (not completely drown out, just soften).  I often wake up when the sun starts coming up and this helps me go right back to sleep.    EDIT: have had this mask for over two years now and still love it.  Washes beautifully and really helps not only with keeping out light, but muffling sounds a bit.  Wouldn&#x27;t trade it for any other mask!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife. She loves it. It&#x27;s large and very soft and nicely padded. She uses it all the time and she&#x27;s been very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this sleep mask for the past few weeks, ever since a friend got it for me as a gift.  I am a busy surgeon, and believe in the benefits of getting extra rest during the day by \\&quot;power napping.\\&quot;  I have been impressed by how lightweight, breathable and unobtrusive the mask feels and how quickly it induces a deep, refreshing nap, even in a daylight environment.  After a few minutes of restful sleep with my Sleep Master, I feel recharged, focused and ready to go.  This outstanding product is a must for people in high pressure jobs with long hours, who need to catch a wink when they can.  I&#x27;m enjoying the best sleep I&#x27;ve had in years, so I bought another one to keep at home for nighttime.</li>
    <li> By far better than others on the market. I would highly recommend this company and product. Not only is it comfortable, but it stays in place and does not shift. Sadly, I purchase atleast 6 others before finding this one. The customer service is outstanding as well.</li>
    <li> This mask truly is AMAZING...It is so comfortable and the fabric is great aganist my sensitive face. I would defintley recommend this to ANYONE who was looking for a great sleep mask. It stays on the whole night and it does muffle some sound but also keeps those cozy ear plugs in (when needed). I usually have to wear a more traditional mask, since I have to take it on and off through the night due to my job (eck) but when I take a nap or I am on vacation I pull this baby out and it is lights out! Sleep Master not only has a GREAT product but TREMENDOUS customer service too, I wish them the luck in the world.  Thank you again!</li>
    <li> So I bought the initial one back in 2008. It leaked a permanent black (bleach wouldn&#x27;t get it out) on white sheets. After pleads by the manufacturer to remove the initial negative review in exchange for a &#x27;non-defective&#x27; unit a few months later when I made the review, and a refund, I gave it another try. After a few months of using it, it leaks YELLOW on these sheets now.    Thoroughly displeased with the product. The one good side to it is that it does what it is supposed to, but at the expense of sheets which shouldn&#x27;t be necessary.</li>
    <li> I always sleep with a sleep mask - considering I have chronic pain that causes poor sleep, I don&#x27;t need the disturbance from light. I&#x27;ve tried many sleep masks, but I always found they slipped too easily or let in too much light. Not so with this one! It holds earplugs in place well, too.  It took a bit of getting used to - mostly \\&quot;how tight or loose do I want it?\\&quot; but once I got that worked out, it&#x27;s contributed to some fabulous nights of sleep for me. That&#x27;s not an easy outcome for me...I&#x27;m off to order another to keep in my travel bag! And the personal note on the receipt from Cynthia, the Amazon merchant for Sleep Master, was a nice touch. :)</li>
    <li> The Amazon reviewers were right on this product.  I purchased this as one of many things I&#x27;m trying to do to increase the sleep!  I&#x27;ve curtained my room, pulled alot of the LED night lights out, closed my door shut (to the chagrin of my cat), and getting to bed earlier.  Oh, Benadryl helps too :)  But this product works as described.  I read one review saying it hurts the person&#x27;s eyeballs.  I did experience this too but then i loosened the strap.  problem solved.</li>
    <li> Not only is this mask comfortable and relaxing, but it does a great job blocking out light and sound (the earplugs that are included help with this, too). This is a great item for when my husband wants to stay up late reading or watching TV &amp; I want to get some sleep. Also perfect for travel. Great gift idea!</li>
    <li> Four previous sleep masks have been unsatisfactory. All of them left light come in from the bottom of the mask. The part over the nose pushed the mask away a little letting light in. Also the bands around the head loosened in time, so much so that the mask became unusable. The Sleep Master solves both of these problems. It has no \\&quot;nosepiece\\&quot; so it fits snugger to the face. It covers a larger area so that if the mask does move slightly (when turning over, etc.) it doen&#x27;t let any light in. But one thing it is not is a sound suppresant. I am hard of hearing and still heard all sounds with the mask on. It was worth paying more for this one.</li>
    <li> I got the product and loved it.  I have the most annoying skylights right over my bed and in the winter the moon just shines in like a flashlight right on my face.  However after a couple of weeks my pillow case developed the brown stain that everyone is referring to here.  I also set the mask on a magazine one day when I got up and that same night when I went to bed, the brown had come out on the magazine cover but it was really oily looking.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the oils from the body/sweat interacting with something or what.  Anyway, I found that by using a spot remover on the stains and a lot of non-chlorine bleach that after 2 washings the pillow case was as good as new (thankfully since they&#x27;re the most wonderful Lands End flannel sheets!).      I&#x27;ve also found that every week or other week I hand wash the mask per the directions along with the non-chlorine bleach and that pretty much mitigates the staining.  Over all a great product as long as you know in advance to wash it frequently (which makes sense when you think about how much time it spends next to your body) and you&#x27;re not a back sleeper.  I find that on the rare occasion I sleep on my back (the Velcro enclosure is right behind the head) it gives me a nasty headache in the morning but that&#x27;s maybe once a month.  Despite all of this, I still wear it every night!!!</li>
    <li> I have never used a sleep mask before, and this product is wonderful. It felt comfortable wearing it the first night I put it on. I was able to sleep through the morning light that creeps in between the shades, which used to wake me up before.</li>
    <li> I have tried several sleep masks over the years but this one really works!! It is exceptionally comfortable...no more small elastic bands that are so annoying. The silky material also is very comfortable and with the velcro, there are options for wearing the mask at just the right comfort level. I am really impressed by this product and delightfully surprised at just how much difference it makes. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> I actually loved the cozy feeling of this sleep mask around my ears but I soon found it slipping off from around my head. There was always a bit of light coming in from the nose area. I would NOT buy this again. Maybe great for travel but I found a better, cheaper alternative at Target. Black out curtains on Amazon (Grommett) were a much better solution. I was dealing with a bright street light near my window. I&#x27;m much happier with the curtains.</li>
    <li> NOT GOOD AT ALL. Does not stay on your face and it&#x27;s not comfortable slips off while sleeping do not buy.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best sleeping eye mask EVER! Stays in place all night, very comfortable, blocks out all the light. Stop wondering if you should get this and just do it!</li>
    <li> dosnt help at all wast of mony .slips easy you wake up and you dont wher it is dont order</li>
    <li> Mask tends not to stay on. Turns easily when shifting positions. Lets light in.&lt;br /&gt;Still searching for ideal mask. Anyone?</li>
    <li> This mask is the final frontier for a guy whose tried so many others.  Yes, it is more expensive than I would have liked but at least my search for a comfortable and effective mask is over.  It blocks light better than the others I&#x27;ve tried and is most comfortable - so on those two most important values it succeeds marvelously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negatives I find are that the mask is thicker and, therefore, more prone to create sweat on your brow during warmer months.  And the fact that it does leave a blue haze on my pillow seems like a material quality problem.  Neither of these issues could sway my opinion against the huge positives the mask has, so I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Although it does have a couple faults and is a bit overpriced, this mask is very comfortable. The over-the-ear straps do serve to muffle distant noises a bit, but it actually amplifies close-up noises that you otherwise wouldn&#x27;t notice, such as your pillow or blanket rubbing against the mask. The nose cut-out also doesn&#x27;t quite fit my nose, so there is some light leakage, but less than other masks I&#x27;ve used. Other masks either tend to be stiff and uncomfortable, or too small and flimsy. This one, however, is comfortable even for side or stomach sleeping - it&#x27;s like having a satin pillow over your eyes. It tends to stay in place better than other masks, and even if it does get a bit crooked during sleep it&#x27;s broad enough that it usually still gives adequate coverage.</li>
    <li> I am a super light sleeper with two dogs, three children under the age of five, and a husband who can easily function on less than five hours of sleep (as opposed to my 8)...so basically, I never sleep.  I&#x27;ve been wearing cheap masks for years, but when the elastic started going on my old mask I decided to come online and splurge a bit to see if it would make a difference in quality.  The answer?  YES it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t normally bother with reviews, but this thing is awesome.  It gives me total darkness (regardless of whether my husband has an iPad on right under my nose), and I love the fact that the velcro is inset so it doesn&#x27;t get stuck in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have stated, it doesn&#x27;t block a ton of noise so you&#x27;ll still need earplugs if you are used to wearing them.  But it DOES keep them from falling out.  The only other con?  I have long curly hair, and since the strap is so wide it has the potential for causing major bed head.  But it is totally worth it!  I just put my hair in a high ponytail to get it out of the way, and it solves the problem.  And even if it didn&#x27;t, I&#x27;m at that point in my life where I&#x27;d probably trade a good hair day for a good night&#x27;s sleep, anyway :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!  It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> I have purchased so many sleep masks before this one and this one takes the cake by miles. It is by far the best. Blocks out all light AND you don&#x27;t wake up with creases on your face. I subtracted one star because of the difficulty cleaning it. It says handwash only but that doesnt seem to be enough. It&#x27;s fine after a round in the washer. However, don&#x27;t ever put it in the dryer as it looks and feels completely different afterwards.</li>
    <li> Bought this to put in my husband&#x27;s stocking.  He&#x27;s gone through several sleep masks, but he says this one is his favorite by far.  Worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of sleep masks out there, from the free ones that come from airlines when you&#x27;re bumped up to first class to others I&#x27;ve paid for directly. This is the best I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In recent years, I&#x27;ve become very sensitive to light when I sleep. I have blackout shades at home, but I travel a lot and sometimes the blinds don&#x27;t close all the way. This sleep mask really shuts out everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little weird to wear at first. It&#x27;s like wearing an extra pillow on your face. Sleeping with it the first night takes some getting used to. But after that, it&#x27;s very comfortable. It also blocks out pretty much everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here was the real test for me: I left in a hotel room awhile back. I decided to suck it up and order another. I&#x27;m glad I did, as I&#x27;ve taken it with me on several trips since then and used it repeatedly. That to me is the ultimate test, as there aren&#x27;t so many products that I&#x27;d replace if I lost them.</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier than expected, so just in time for Christmas. Works great!  My wife has owned a number of eye masks, and always seems to find faults in the eye masks from either: no light coming through or falling off in the night.  However, my wife calls this mask \\&quot;the Cadillac of eye masks\\&quot;.  As a luxury eye mask, it performs all of the functions of an eye mask with added comfort.</li>
    <li> the material it&#x27;s too slippery and doesn&#x27;t stay on my head.  I tried to adjust the setting but still didn&#x27;t work.  it&#x27;s not worth what I paid for.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband, since he really love sleeping masks. But this one does not look like working for him. He was putting some cotton pads on his eyes between the mask. Not sure why.&lt;br /&gt;And I do not see him using it much. I think it is too big.&lt;br /&gt;But he definitely likes it when he is sitting on a massage chair and relaxing.</li>
    <li> I wake up every morning with this thing on top of my head or just completely tossed to the side. The problem is it slides off the face easily. You have to find that sweet spot of just enough pressure and position so it won&#x27;t slide off. still the best mask I&#x27;ve ever had. It&#x27;s comfortable and it blocks out all the light.</li>
    <li> A totally useless sleep mask.  I replaced it with a cheap one from a local store.  The cheap one did a better job.</li>
    <li> No light filters through this mask at all! Not even by the nose. I like that it covers your ears too. There is no elastic involved- which is great and the materials used are very soft and breathable. I purchased this during the middle of the summer and was worried it would make me hotter at night, but it has not. Sometimes I still use earplugs with it because I live in NYC on a busy street, but if I were in the suburbs I think this mask softens sound well enough on it&#x27;s own. Ships in a timely manner in logical packaging. Worth the price and the company has been excellent to deal with.</li>
    <li> I have used sleep masks for many years. It is just one of my eccentricities. When my old one was sufficiently grotty, I came to Amazon for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one works, but it is not the best. Instead of something like Zorro&#x27;s mask without the eyeholes, this is like a tiny blue satin cummerbund. Your nose goes in a little notch and Velcro fastens the whole thing behind your head. The packaging claims the thing covers your ears to dampen noise. More like it covers the tops of your ears for no real reason at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take it from one who knows, what you want in a sleep mask is the ability to open your eyes under the blindfold. If you cannot, the thing feels claustrophobic. This mask is too close to your eyelids, and you can feel the closeness. Further, the wrap-around style is warm (remarkable how much heat comes off your head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, since this is basically just a flat strip, it does pack nicely in your carry-on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, go with the more conventional design.</li>
    <li> I´m not contented at all. Around th nose light leaks in. I do´nt use it any more. I think it is a bad construction.</li>
    <li> I have only recently started wearing sleep masks. Counting the Sleep Master this is the third one I&#x27;ve tried and the best. If you snug the velcro tight enough (but not so tight it&#x27;s uncomfortable), no light creeps in around the mask. Also, the strap design is very comfortable, as it&#x27;s simply a continuation of the mask and not added-on elastic straps. I have no complaints about the product, but I can&#x27;t wear it all night. I just don&#x27;t like having something on my face that long. So I take it off after a few hours and put it back on before the sun comes up. Terrific product.</li>
    <li> The Revolutionary, Patented Sleep Master Sleep Mask is comfortble, blocks out all light.  It&#x27;s the best sleep mask I&#x27;ver ever had and when it wears out I will purchase another one.</li>
    <li> My needs might be different from others but my eye lids are very thin and I needed something that was as comfortable as possible but blocks out absolute 100% of the light and this one does it without a lot of pressure on the bridge of my nose which is also an issue particular to me. It blocks some sound but not a lot because noise is not one of my issues.  It can be a little hot at times but tolerable because the comfort otherwise is so good. It does put a little pressure on the eyes but not enough to bother me. I wear it all night with no issues.</li>
    <li> This is the best sleep mask I&#x27;ve ever used.  The material is so soft against your skin you hardly know it&#x27;s there.  It almost feels like silk but I believe it&#x27;s a synthetic material.  I got one a couple of years ago and really liked it so just purchased a second one and it was better than the first one.  The new model is wider and just sleeps like there&#x27;s nothing there and best of all it blocks all the light so I can get the light free sleep I need.  Well worth the money spent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a truck driver who drives team so my sleep times are all over the place.  I could be sleeping in the middle of the day or night depending on when I end my shift.  I&#x27;ve always had trouble falling asleep in the middle of the day because of the light but with this mask I get an excellent night&#x27;s sleep.  The only problem is my co-driver used to wake me up by flashing the dome light in the truck on and off repeatedly.  Now he has to blow the air horn or run the rumbble strips to get me up!  Best night&#x27;s sleep ever. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I really like this sleep mask.  It&#x27;s smooth, soft and very comfortable.  I also like that it wraps around my ears.  It helps keep my earplugs in place and without the earplugs it muffles sound enough for me to fall asleep while my husband watches the TV.</li>
    <li> I work night shift as an RN and needed an industrial grade sleep mask.  I&#x27;ve tried several different masks and this one is the best for staying on and keeping the light out.  Huge velcro strap in the back is fully adjustable.</li>
    <li> This sleeping mask is so comfortable and I love the way it fits around my head with the adjustable straps. This is a great product. It&#x27;s worth every penny I paid for it.</li>
    <li> Was expensive and it slipped off my head easily.  Can&#x27;t use it.  I returned it.  I think there are other sleep masks out there that are less expensive and work better.</li>
    <li> Soft, covering both eyes and ears. Used it in Antarctica with 24-hour daylight. It provided good  insulation and comfort. Recommended.</li>
    <li> this product is horribly uncomfortable and doesn&#x27;t silence sound even the slightest. I ended up spending $5.00 on a sleeping mask at Wal-Mart and it is far more effective.</li>
    <li> This is the best sleep mask ever. Pricey, but it&#x27;s soft, smooth, you don&#x27;t even feel it when you have it on, and it actually cuts out \\&quot;all\\&quot; the light. It also has a slight muffling effect on sound as it covers the ear too.  I&#x27;s lightly padded and weighs almost nothing. If you need help with sleeping in the daylight or on a flight, this will do the trick. I love it.</li>
    <li> It did a good job of blocking out the light, but I found that without realizing it, I pulled it off of my head whenever I tried to wear it. I&#x27;d wake up to find it on the floor. It&#x27;s fairly comfortable, but it is pretty large.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is pure gold for someone who works 8 p.m.-4 a.m. and needs to sleep during that pesky light coming in through the window.  I&#x27;ve had 3 other sleep masks that fell apart within 1-3 months of use and didn&#x27;t screen light nearly as well.  The material of this is pleasantly cool and slick similar to silk with broad flaps that go around to the back of your head, where its secured by a velcro patch, allowing you to seat the mask as loosely or as firmly as your preference dictates.  These broad flaps provide a unexpected extra to a sleep mask I hadn&#x27;t considered before that I found myself very grateful for.  They cover your ears, and while that isn&#x27;t quite as much as a noise cancellation ear bud, it does dampen sharp sounds so they are not as jarring should they wake you, allowing you to return to sleep more readily.  The product even comes included with a pair of disposable foam earplugs that further enhance this quality if you&#x27;re in a noisy area that needs additional sound dampening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the true king is the light blocking with the layering of the material being dense enough to completely block light provided you seat it properly on your face.  I shave my head and yet this material breathes enough to where I do not wake with a &#x27;sweat band&#x27; effect, nor does it slide off in my sleep even when I&#x27;ve used a looser fit.  Finally this mask washes nicely in a delicate cycle without loosing any of its light blocking qualities, pleasant skin sensation, or firmness of fit.</li>
    <li> I was pretty disappointed by this sleep mask. The material is thick enough to block light from the top, but you have to fasten it uncomfortably tight to get the mask to gather around your nose (as pictured) and therefore block out the light from the bottom part of the mask. The material is not very &amp;#34;breathable.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Material and closure is excellent since it won&#x27;t pull hair out like other masks do. But the ear noise reduction is overrated, the satin material covers ears but does not reduce noise. Thx!</li>
    <li> This mask is great size -wise. Very large to keep out light. However, it&#x27;s made of satin and slides around my head all night- not great for keeping out light!  I also, like other reviewers, find that the large size keeps my face too warm.  I am disappointed and will be going back to my cheaper, smaller, non moving mask :(</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is soft, fits well, blocks light perfectly, and doesn&#x27;t constrict your head, eyelids or nose.  Throw away those free masks you get on the plane and the cheap one in your drawer that has \\&quot;Princess\\&quot; emblazoned with rhinestones, and enjoy your sleep!</li>
    <li> This \\&quot;sleep mask\\&quot; is big. No, really, it&#x27;s huge! Don&#x27;t even think \\&quot;blindfold\\&quot;---think \\&quot;scarf\\&quot;. It&#x27;s just a huge piece of cloth that sort of tapers a little on which someone cut out a notch for a nose and put some Velcro on the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you try to fasten then directly behind your eyes on the back of your head, it quickly slides down. (It&#x27;s so large that only part of it would be touching your head, anyway.) If you try to fasten it lower, on the base of your neck, now slides down off your face in the front---this is just a big piece of cloth, remember?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it two stars because, I suppose, if you didn&#x27;t have any other piece of cloth to wrap around your head, this would be better than nothing. But I&#x27;m sending mine back and getting a couple of $10 sleep masks from Walgreens.</li>
    <li> I received this mask as a gift from a friend shortly after moving into my new house. It was a big help before the window covers were installed and I still use it when I want to rest in a complete darkness.  It is very soothing, breathes well and the wider side panels make it much more comfortable than the masks made with thin elastic straps. It fits and stays on better too. I highly recommend this well-designed mask.</li>
    <li> The Sleep Master is better than advertised!!! The fit is snug but not tight and EXTREMELY comfortable. Although the price was a bit more than I had hoped to spend, I&#x27;m pleased to report that it&#x27;s worth every penny...PLUS...delivery was earlier than the guaranteed date. Amazon, my thanks for providing access to this wonderful product. Sleep Master, be ready for my holiday order. Family &amp; friends will be finding a SLEEP MASTER in their stockings this year.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other sleep masks, but this one is far more comfortable wearing.&lt;br /&gt;It does not feel pressing yet keeps light from leaking through edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product!</li>
    <li> The comfort of this sleep mask makes it the best one I have found. It stays in place and no matter which way you turn there is only soft fabric and batting around your head.</li>
    <li> I never had problems sleeping until I moved about a year ago.  I always wake up in the early morning because where my bed is get&#x27;s a lot of bright sun light.  So, I decided to try a sleep mask.  This one is nice because it&#x27;s silky and feels good on my face when I put it on, however (maybe I have a tiny head) cause I always wake up with the mask no longer on my face.  It falls off and I wind up waking up to because of the bright sunlight.  Overall, I&#x27;m disappointed with the product, hopefully I can find a way to get it to stay on.</li>
    <li> I have tried using many sleep masks in the past, and they all let light through. I was hesitant to try the Sleep Master because I thought it&#x27;d be like the rest of them, or even uncomfortable. The mask looks bulky in the picture but it&#x27;s not at all, it&#x27;s so comfortable! When I put it on each night, no light comes through and it actually blocks some sound out. When I wake up in the morning, there&#x27;s not a single mark on my face. I&#x27;ve said it before and I&#x27;ll say it again, the sleep master is my new best friend.</li>
    <li> The Sleep Master Sleep Mask is a step in the right direction for any light-sensitive sleepers, or those working night shifts and need to sleep during the day.  If you&#x27;ve ever used blackout curtains, they&#x27;re great at making your room a blacked-out cave, perfect for resting regardless of what&#x27;s happening outside. Sleep Master has taken the concept of blackout curtains and made it so much more reasonable, easy to install, and supremely portable! This mask is the logical step back from the curtains, as you simply place it over you eyes for the same result. Curtains have to be set up, dusted, and maintained. This is a simple mask that you can take anywhere and use whenever you might need to - it&#x27;s a logical evolution of the same idea behind the curtains. They even went one step further and included a set of earplugs to complete the package - giving you protection from interrupting light AND noise. Such a good system, and way safer than sleeping aid pills. If you&#x27;re having trouble getting a good night&#x27;s (or day&#x27;s) sleep - try this first.</li>
    <li> I love this eyemask. It doesn&#x27;t mask sound very well but it does slightly. It&#x27;s nice and cool and comfy. Blocks light very well.</li>
    <li> I have sleep apnea and use a sleep mask and ear plugs to assist me in my sleep along with a CPAP machine. This item it first of all very large around your head and if you are someone who gets too warm this item will make you sweat. Also, it doesn&#x27;t have molded eye areas that some other brands do and it pushes on your eye lids and I just coudln&#x27;t sleep with it at all. Search for this item on Amazon, it is much better: Dream Essentials Sweet Dreams Contoured Sleep Mask with Earplugs and Carry Pouch, Black</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used sleep masks to keep the morning light out before I was ready to get up.  Problem was many times they would fall off during the night and I&#x27;d be greeted by the dawn&#x27;s early light. My daughter gave me this one as a gift. Finally, not only is the Sleep Master always still on in the morning no matter how much I twist and turn during the night, but it is so soothing and comfortable that I feel like I&#x27;ve slept better-- Maybe I&#x27;m just not twisting and turning so much because this mask is so comforting!  In any case, I have to recommend you try this mask if you&#x27;re looking for something more substantial than the flimsy type of mask that twists folds, gapes or comes off during the night.</li>
    <li> I found the Sleep Master Mask to be well designed, of quality materials and stitching, easy to pack when traveling, a good adjustable fit around my head and comfortable enough to wear throughout a good nights sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I have a weak spot in my heart for products Made in USA.  I don&#x27;t know if its form, fit and function is degraded after machine washing as I have yet to add it to laundry load.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hint: cheap Sleep Masks sold at WalMart do not hold their form, fit and function after being subjected to a single machine wash cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this quality product when traveling and at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product every night when traveling through Europe this past September and early October.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update review after running mask through a few wash cycles.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Revolutionary patented Sleep Master Sleep Mask for years. I have become so attached to my sleep mask that I use it at night or for a mid-day nap.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of fabric and craftsmanship is superior. As I have washed my masks many times throughout the years, they are very durable, yet keeps its quality of softness.&lt;br /&gt;Bravo! Some sleep mask genius understands the frame of the skull and our changing sleep positions throughout the night.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and don&#x27;t leave home without it. You may get a lousy night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side: It is VERY soft and feels great, It covers the ears to offer a little sound dampening, it velcros in the back so the fit is adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side: I don&#x27;t think they got the nose cutout \\&quot;just right\\&quot;, the nose cutout does not go high enough resulting in having to pull it down lower so light does not come in the bottom, this causes the nose cutout to apply pressure to the bridge of your nose and the threading along the nose cutout is not very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone who used to never wear sleep masks I would say this is a good one but it&#x27;s not perfect, yet. A couple changes(which I may make myself) would make this mask perfect for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL:DR A good, soft, adjustable sleep mask that may be right for you.</li>
    <li> This is the fourth mask I have purchased over the last several years. So happy they are still making this product. I have tried many other sleep masks and this is by far the best. Does not lose shape after gentle handwashing. Recently purchased one for my daughter who works the night shift and must sleep during the day. She couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
    <li> Hurts the back of my head (a little bit)</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product based on the reviews.  It&#x27;s not bad...it&#x27;s just not as amazing as everyone else says.  For one thing, if you have a large than average size nose like me, the mask doesn&#x27;t fully block out all light.  Also, the sides of the mask tend to tickle the sides of my nose at night.  The mask is decently comfortable to wear but it makes firm contact with your eyelids (not concave) and that can be annoying and take some getting used to.  To eliminate this, I sometimes try to keep it loose around my head but then the mask moved around too much and I find that annoying too.  The mask does offer some small level of noise canceling and I do find that I get better sleep with it on (when it&#x27;s not tickling my nose or pressing too firmly on my eyelids).</li>
    <li> OK for side sleeper.  The double fold Velcro rear latch bothers me sleeping on my back.  Too much bulk.</li>
    <li> I truly love this sleep mask... soft, silk-like material that will have you dead to the world in three minutes or less.</li>
    <li> Interfered with my eyesight when I took them off. My vision was blurry (maybe they were too tight). I need to be able to move my eye.  Very soft but must be adjust right. I use Bedtime Bliss® Contoured &amp; Comfortable Sleep Mask instead now.</li>
    <li> Absolute junk.  No sound protection,  or barely any.  Satin fabric gets hairs that tickle you&#x27;re skin at night.</li>
    <li> Decided to try this since the reviews are so great. Tried it for about 20 minutes, took it off and haven&#x27;t put it on again. You would think with that much material, it would do a great job of blocking the light - but I still see it around my nose. But even worse, it&#x27;s way too warm.</li>
    <li> I received this the next day after ordering! They are extremely comfortable and as someone who uses a blanket to cover my eyes and ears at night, this has helped immensely. They don&#x27;t block out all sound but it muffles the noise so at least you don&#x27;t hear complete &amp;#34;silence&amp;#34; which is what I don&#x27;t like to hear when I sleep. It blocks out all light and has a nice, satin-like feel that doesn&#x27;t snag on your pillow. I love this and would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Hot, heavy, expensive and does not stay in place. Am very disappointed. Am a flight attendant and work red eyes. That makes me a day sleeper. The inexpensive ones just as well.</li>
    <li> I generally wake up during the night when I sleep.  Even if it is quiet, so I decided to try this product.  WOW!  I am happy!</li>
    <li> Wow, I work offshore and have needed this item to block out light. It has functioned above and beyond what I&#x27;d hoped. It also muffles sound. It is very comfortable and peaceful. I&#x27;ll be buying another one just to have stocked.</li>
    <li> Yes this sleep mask wraps around your head and allows you the ability to roll around and not have it come off, but overall, it still lets light in through the nose area.  I bought another mask on here for $10 which works way better and feels nicer.  I would rather have two of those and have $5 back instead of this one.  Pass!</li>
    <li> As mentioned by others, this puts way too much pressure on your eyes and doesn&#x27;t stay in place when turning your head. Overpriced, and not worth it. I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
    <li> This product is the best sleep aid.  It is extremely comfortable and great at blocking out the light.  Would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing masks for many years.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve been inspired to write a review, however.  It covers the eyes -- as they all do -- but this one is satin-soft -- unlike any other I&#x27;ve used previously.  It&#x27;s \\&quot;wide\\&quot; and continues over the ears and has Velcro on the back which...for me...holds my hair down and eliminates bed-head. It serves the purpose of a satin pillow case, without the pillowcase. A plus I&#x27;d never considered previously!  Anyway...what can you say about a mask other than I really really like it.  It does its job with some additional benefits, as mentioned.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have always slept with eye covers, and these are the most comfortable I have ever found.  Takes a bit to get used to the extra bulk behind your head, but totally worth it b/c the work so well.</li>
    <li> at any comfortable tightness, rolling over will cause it to slide away from the eyes. each time i woke up i found it had rotated around my head. it&#x27;s a terrible design that the fabric wraps around the entire head because this allows it to roll and the sound of the fabric also transfers into the ears. why is it so thick all around? a 3 or 4 dollar sleep mask stays put with an elastic and surrounds the eyes well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i gave it several chances but it&#x27;s been sitting in a drawer for years now. i don&#x27;t get the hype</li>
    <li> Feels really soft, adjustable Velcro strap so it doesn&#x27;t have to be too tight and put pressure on your eyes, and even muffles the ears a little AND it came with ear plugs. I&#x27;m pretty sure my mom will love this and sleep soundly. Also, it was delivered super fast.</li>
    <li> THis is an overpriced sleeping mask.  Not sure why but it got some kind of stain on it that won&#x27;t come off (maybe my skin lotions?).  I really didn&#x27;t like it any more than a regular sleeping mask.</li>
    <li> I was surprised how much I like and use this sleep mask. It is silky soft and fits perfectly, blocking out light but muting sound just enough to avoid mild night noises.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing sleep mask that has ever existed! I sleep with it every night. You can adjust it to be as light or tight as you like. It gently covers your ears too to block out the noise. Get this now!</li>
    <li> Blocks out light 100%! Blocks out noise 0%! You must use the included ear plugs for any noise reduction...</li>
    <li> This is my favorite sleep mask ever. I bought 2. I love the velcro and the feeling. I wish it came in different colors. I love the extra earplugs. I think that after some time threads come loose that tickle my nose but those can easily be trimmed. Still top of the line though.</li>
    <li> Sorry - too slippery for me!  I had to return it.  Well made, but it won&#x27;t stay in one place unless I make it too tight for my eyes.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband because he likes a dark room in the early morning and when we&#x27;re traveling we can&#x27;t be sure of conditions. He loves it so much he uses it every morning as I wake an hour before he does. It helps keep out both the noise and the light. It also stays in place well.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking that the hype in the product description was all it was cracked up to be.  It&#x27;s a slik layer cloth with velcro on the back.  It&#x27;s not comfortable because it puts pressure on your eyesand it&#x27;s not worth the money, I bought a mask from walgreens for less than half the price of this one and it works just fine.  Don&#x27;t waste your money, this is a complete rip off.</li>
    <li> It is alright, but there&#x27;s a tiny lump where the velcro meets up on the back.  Depends on how much you care about these subtleties.&lt;br /&gt;also, the ears being covered is unexpectedly annoying.  I thought it would be good for blocking out sound, but it puts a weird smushy pressure on your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Better design might have involved a firmer eye portion, and an elasticized portion around the rest of the head</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be the best $25 investment yet. Overlooking other traditional sleep masks that were half the price, I went with the Sleep Master because of the reviews and the word &amp;#34;revolutionary&amp;#34;. The first night I tried it, it made me feel really claustrophobic. The thick material wraps around your entire head, so it won&#x27;t work if you sleep with your hair up in a ponytail. I have long thick hair and when I tried the Sleep Master with my hair down, I felt like I was sleeping with a small bag over my head. That said, I am sure that people with short/no hair will enjoy this better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The material, although so soft and silky, doesn&#x27;t stay put and slides around easily. I used it one time and haven&#x27;t used it since.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t block much noise out at all. Doesn&#x27;t stay on my head. The material is all satin or stain like so it just slips right now as soon as I fall asleep.</li>
    <li> They said this thing was comfortable... They weren&#x27;t kidding...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really is comfortable! The regular, low quality sleep masks have straps that dig into the skin behind the ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does a good job blocking out the light and does so comfortably; albeit it looks really weird when you wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, soft, and stays in place.  The cloth does put a bit of pressure on your eyelids as noted in other reviews.  This bothers me somewhat as I&#x27;m falling asleep but not enough to keep me awake, and once I&#x27;m asleep it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  You can also alleviate the pressure a bit by adjusting the tightness of the band so that it&#x27;s just barely enough to keep the mask in place and block light from getting in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would probably not be a good item to use if you have to sleep in a warm or hot room as you are basically wrapping a little insulated covering around your head.</li>
    <li> i work nightshift and the light and sounds are the 2 worst things to me - this definitely helps blocking the light and it is soft enough to maintain on while sleeping. the thing i liked is that im nasally challenge in size and it shaped around my honker.</li>
    <li> Great product - I use it to sleep and meditate! Loved its ability to block out sound. Very happy with how quickly it arrived. Loved the personal touch on the receipt! Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CD</li>
    <li> I love this mask. It is my first one and it does a great job.The mask stays on all night,and with the help of the soft ear plugs,I get a good nights sleep.It is well made right here in the USA. By the way , it does get very hot sometimes under the mask.</li>
    <li> I never used a sleep mask before, so I am surprised at how comfortable this one is. It&#x27;s silky soft and padded. It really makes a difference in the quality of my sleep. The smallest bit of light affects sleep quality, so unless your bedroom is dark as a cave, you really should have one of these masks.</li>
    <li> My wife and I have had many different sleep masks, but none of them match this one.  It blocks the light better than anything else we have tried, even in the middle of the day, and it somewhat blocks sound.  Unlike most other sleep masks, it&#x27;s very sturdy, and won&#x27;t fall apart in a few months.  It&#x27;s design, with velcro holding it together, is much better than the usual elastic band.  Usually the elastic stretches and eventually wears out.  But velcro lasts for a long long time, so I expect this to last for years.  It&#x27;s well worth the money.  Buy it right now.</li>
    <li> The mask is great and is very effective with my CPAP machine. It secures the nose CPAP mask from moving during the night giving greater comfort.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why other people haven&#x27;t mentioned this...but unfortunately this stains your sheets/pillowcases very badly! I bought this for my husband and he loves how it fits and feels (which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1)..but it has completely ruined our pillowcases (they are white w/ a print on them)...therefore this product is very flawed and useless..it has never been wet or anything. I sadly now have to replace our bedding set (which wasn&#x27;t cheap).</li>
    <li> when I  ware it that it turns around all the time. the fabric feels good, but it doesn&#x27;t help my sleeping much.</li>
    <li> I am such a light sleeper.  Any light and any noise wakes me up.  I have slept so much better with the Sleep Master!</li>
    <li> This mask is very soft and comfortable.  It really keeps out the light so that I can sleep peacefully.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> not very confortable, made me sweat, not good when flying as it smuges your make up but ok for home or hospitals</li>
    <li> This sleep mask does all it says it will do.  It is truly comfortable on the eyes, ears and head.  It is adjustable so you can regulate how tight you want it.</li>
    <li> Never wore a mask before, I have a neighbor that leaves their kitchen light on, which shines under my blinds as if its daylight out.  It takes a bit to get used to it, it is slightly warm to the head.  Compared to placing a pillow over my head which I was doing prior, this is way more comfortable.  I will be adding this to my fav. list, will probably purchase a 2nd one as a back up.  Its easy on.  I leave the velcro where it is, and just slid off my head.  When I go to bed, just slid it on.  No pressure over the eyes while I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used sleeping mask in the past and this has to be the worst. It slides all over your head and does not have eye indentions.</li>
    <li> I use a sleep mask on a regular basis. this is a quality product for the money.  if it is hot in room you may get a little sticky, but good overall product.</li>
    <li> What I&#x27;ve been needing. Well worth the price. No Trucker should be without one.  One thing you will need to remember to do once you have the Mask, \\&quot;Turn the lights out\\&quot; Once you put the Mask on you can&#x27;t tell that the lights are still on. It works just that good.</li>
    <li> I work nights and although it doesn&#x27;t always stay in place; it helps block the light helping me sleep sounder and longer.</li>
    <li> When we moved into our new home we got drapes to darken the bedroom, but that was not enough.  There were too many openings for the sun.  Once I purchased the Sleeper Master Sleep Mask and I wore it, the mask provided the darkness I wanted for an afternoon nap.  Grateful for being able to catch up with much needed sleep.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is so good that I immediately purchased it again after leaving the original in a hotel room. Great at blocking out light. Good, snug fit on eyes (in a good way) but not the forehead. And my nose isn&#x27;t covered, which is so important for me to be able to sleep. I love the way this mask wraps around the head without weird elastic. And the material is silky soft.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and item was just as described. I love the sleep mask! The design is really comfortable and what I love most about it is that because of the velcro strap, the mask actually covers your ears instead of the other masks which use the ears for support which doesn&#x27;t make it any easier to sleep. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I tried 3 different sleep masks which I found to be ineffective and uncomfortable-----resulting in being sleep deprived. I found the Sleep Master mask and although it cost more than the others, I decided to give it a try.  I have used it the last 2 nights and found it to be comfortable with a great fit.  I slept through the night without any annoying mask shifting, without any light leaking in, without getting my hair caught in the velcro strap and without strap abrasion on my ears---best sleep I have had in a long time.  The mask comes with a set of ear plugs, but I found that even without them the mask design provides for a quieter environment.  It is well worth the cost and I only regret not finding this mask sooner. Highly recommend the mask.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Comfortable product. Completely wraps the eyes and ears. Nice finish and good fitting strap. Slightly overpriced</li>
    <li> I am using this mask from almost 2 month , this comes up with ear plugs, it really covers whole eye n with ear plug n sleep mask covers the ear so reduce the noise to very minimum. So far problem is that material they used to make sleep mask it has pulling out small threads from mask. That s why I gave 4 star. It does it job well , I łl recommend to person who is very sensitive to light n noise during sleep</li>
    <li> So soft and so comfortable.. Easy to adjust by using Velcro at the back .. I was able to sleep like a baby ..&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend this Sleep Master Mask to all my friends ..</li>
    <li> It blocks all the light. But its much too uncomfortable to wear for more than a few minutes. I made a video of the issues on youtube. Should be easy to find if you want to see the details.</li>
    <li> I have always hated sleep masks.  The little elastic strap was annoying on my ears and they didn&#x27;t fit with my CPAP mask.  I have to say this mask was the answer to everything I wanted in a sleep mask. It is soft and doesn&#x27;t have the annoying little elastic strap. This fits my face and also around my CPAP mask and still does not let the light in.  It is wide enough to go around my head and fit securely with the velcro band on the inside of the mask.  It doesn&#x27;t get caught in my long hair.  Since I purchased it I have shown it to several friends who are also ordering it.</li>
    <li> Ok, do I look like I am in a bedroom scene of a Housewives of Beverly Hills episode when I am wearing this thing?  Probably.  Is it bulkier than the cheap eye masks they hand out in business class?  Yes.  Does it take me to dreamland even in an uncomfortable middle seat in coach flying from Tel Aviv to Berlin for 5 hours? Yes.  It&#x27;s soft, wraps around my ears and blocks ALL light and lets me feel like I am wrapped in a soft cocoon while I sleep--what better invention could there be for plane travel?  This is a must have for sleeping anywhere.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Sleep Master mask and absolutely love it. It is so much more comfortable than any other sleep mask I have tried and the quality of the mask is outstanding. It totally blocks all light making for a truly restful night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
    <li> I love this mask--VERY comfortable---the wide band and the cut out for the nose makes it the best mask I have tried--I liked it so much I ordered a second one</li>
    <li> I have worn an eye mask to sleep for 15 years, and when I saw this one, I WANTED to love it!!  The first time I put it on, I was THRILLED at how well it fit and the complete darkness it offered.  Unfortunately when I woke up in the morning, I had had a pretty severe allergic reaction to either the material, or a chemical on the material.  Having had MANY sleep masks in the past, it never occurred to me I might ever had a reaction like this.  My eyes were swollen almost completely shut, as well as my cheeks being swollen like crazy.  Having spent $25 on it I was determined to be able to use it, so I ran it through the washing machine for the next 5 loads of laundry that I did, hoping to wash away whatever was causing the reaction.  Sadly, I wore it again and had the exact same reaction.  So disappointed I am unable to use it, and lost $25 in the process.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me and my own body&#x27;s reaction, so I don&#x27;t want to scare anyone away, but having worn sleep masks all my adult life, this is the first one I have ever been &amp;#34;allergic&amp;#34; to.  :(</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lasted over 2 years. But I couldn&#x27;t find it last night before bed and I slept awful without it. It&#x27;s soft and comfortable. It doesn&#x27;t press on your eyes if you don&#x27;t strap it too tight. I&#x27;m never hot or sweaty under it. One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made. It&#x27;s vastly improved my sleep over the last 2 years. I even wore it in labor so I could relax, tune out the lights and noise of the hospital and use my hypnobabies recordings. It&#x27;s great nursing at night too. I can just roll over, latch baby onto the other side and get right back to sleep with no light exposure. I had an awful night last night with light exposure every time baby woke up. It&#x27;s not worth waiting till I can find the old one. I NEED this sleep mask!</li>
    <li> Great. Stays in place. Comfortable. This item was not received. I repeat. not received. Please replace. This is the</li>
    <li> Best eye covers ever. Gets a bit hot but boy do they keep out light. You may oversleep.</li>
    <li> Invaluable, comfortable, I have two sleep masks in rotation so I don&#x27;t go through the dreaded Linus&#x27; blanket separation anxiety when one is being carefully washed and drip-dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came late to eye shades / sleep masks. Up until 2 years ago, the only times I had worn a sleep mask were on transcontinental flights. I didn&#x27;t like those occasional experiences of eye masks, found them uncomfortable, and only wore them on long-haul flights. THEN: giant street lights moved into our neighborhood and shined directly into our bedroom all night long, which had lots of windows. I had much trouble getting to sleep and then couldn&#x27;t stay asleep. Remembering my airline kit, I retrieved a flimsy eye mask and WOW - slept through the night for the first time in weeks. I still didn&#x27;t like the airline eye shade, so I went in search of alternatives, trying several brands and styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sleep master sleep mask is now my favorite for home and travel. I depend on it for a good night&#x27;s sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you may or may not like: it doesn&#x27;t have the cups, or molded sections that leave your eyes untouched, but still in dark. The sleep master fits snugly against your eyes. While I get the idea that the bug-eyed masks leave your eyes free to move around in REM sleep or whatever, and that makes sense to me, I have no problems sleeping or dreaming with this mask. If you don&#x27;t like something (even a comfortable something) against your eye/face, the sleep master might not be for you. Btw, I thought I would prefer the molded extruded eye mask, but this sleep master turns out to be my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; is that if I&#x27;m trying to sleep in an overly warm environment, like no AC in summer or a hot plane, the mask is too much, feels sticky, too hot, simply because it is a nice big padded thing. Luckily, I&#x27;m mostly able to sleep in reasonably cool environs, even if that means turning on AC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, because it covers my ears as well, it reducesnoise a little. Not like ear plugs, but a little, which is nice.</li>
    <li> Seriously flawed design:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) The slippery satiny material does not stay in place as you move during the night, no matter how tightly you attach the Velcro.  So, there is no protection from light anymore.&lt;br /&gt;(2) The coverage of the ears is totally useless and does not attenuate noise much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very overpriced, very disappointing product of low design quality.</li>
    <li> Used it on flight back from Hawaii yesterday and slept basically the whole way. So very helpful and so very comfortable!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching so long ... to find an answer. Perfect space for nose. Not great if your room is warm but otherwise amazing!</li>
    <li> Not so special and &amp;#34;revolutionary&amp;#34; but nonetheless it blocks out light.</li>
    <li> My sweet fiance gave me one of these masks and all I can say is WOW!  Very comfortable, silky soft, and does a great job blocking out the light. Also, it&#x27;s great that the mask doesn&#x27;t smush any sleep lines into my face so I wake up refreshed and gorgeous after I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also - to comment on some of the other reviews I&#x27;ve seen: I don&#x27;t notice any pressure on my eyes at all when I&#x27;m wearing this mask. Also, I did feel the velcro on the back of my head when I slept on my back and it was annoying. My solution to this was to move the strap down about an inch. Problem solved - and the mask stayed in place just fine!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make these in pink and I&#x27;ll get another one!!</li>
    <li> I gave this product about a week before the splitting headaches it was giving me from crushing my eyes forced me to return it. I tried adjusting the tightness, but to no avail. It also does not block light entirely, and it is too large for my nose, leaving gaps for light to travel in. As stated by a few other buyers, it slides around on your head if you move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dream Essentials makes a much better product and I recommend their brand over Sleep Master.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve now owned this sleep mask for 2.5 years, and I cannot recommend it more highly. I am a morning person who lives with a night owl, and it has saved our relationship!  It is very comfortable, long-wearing, completely blocks out light and some sound, and is very easy to clean. I now have 2 of them - just in case I leave one behind when traveling. It&#x27;s much bigger than a typical sleep mask, and that&#x27;s one of its best features.</li>
    <li> This is very comfortable to wear but its never on my head in the mornings when I wake up. I guess I move around too much. I&#x27;m fairly happy with it, though. Anything to help my insomnia is needed.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left the one I bought in a hotel room in San Francisco, a nice hotel where typically if you leave something it is there for you when you call and they mail it out, no charge.  Somehow this time the staff could not find  my mask - amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew immediately that whomever found it didn&#x27;t want to give it up - and frankly I don&#x27;t blame them.  I ordered a second one immediately even though the one I lost was almost new, I had to have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight, no pressure, covers completely, and, upon my second order I noticed the BEST part... MADE IN THE USA!!!!  Ever notice nothing is made here anymore?  This one IS.  Wonderful purchase, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Yes, I said noisey.  In some of the reviews I read prior to ordering this, people mentioned that they liked the fact that it covered the ears and that it somewhat muffled sounds.  Apparently, I am a much lighter sleeper than those people.  The design of this is not one that I would choose again.  The sides are too wide (the same width as the front) and cover the ears making &amp;#34;scratchy&amp;#34; noises as it rubs the hair.  It does keep out most of the light so it serves it&#x27;s purpose. For those less sensitive to noise it would probably  be fine. I would prefer more of a narrow band on the sides and back. I would have returned it but was so convinced that I would like it I threw the packaging away.</li>
    <li> I have a chronic dry eye condition and have to tape my eyes shut at night with adhesive tapes to keep them wet all night. before i found this mask the tapes would be loose in the morning and leaky - my eyes would be dry. now with this mask i find the tapes are still tightly attached and my eyes moist and happy. an added benefit is that the mask blocks the light and i sleep better. the mask is very comfortable. also does not dent your hair or slide around at night!</li>
    <li> Works great I work nights so getting home at 6 am and the sun is bright it helps me sleep with blocking out the sun light. Wife doesn&#x27;t want the block out shades, So the eye shades work AWESOME.</li>
    <li> i just received my sleepmaster sleep mask.  After using the mask for several nights, ireally got a comfortable night sleep.  my eyes don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;ve been sqeezed all night. This is truly the most comfortable sleep mask I used.</li>
    <li> In the past I have used (and continue to use) the Hibermate sleep mask. I tried the other out of curiousity - which I wish I hadn&#x27;t. While this sleep mask blocks out the light I found it was too hot. The material covers too much of the head and all around the back. Between the thickness and the width it holds in the heat from your head. If you were in a cold environment it would be better.</li>
    <li> I chose this mask because I wanted something that would block light, be comfortable over my face and ears, and have a non-stretch band that would have a long, useful life. The band is adjustable via velcro. The lack of elastic is what will give it a long life. The one comfort exception is where the band fastens: at the back of the skull. When I lay on my back, the thick band raises my head a little. The rise is especially noticeable when I&#x27;m snoozing in the recliner rather than against pillows that give and neutralize the problem. In the chair, I must turn my face to one side because the weight of my skull against the velcro becomes uncomfortable in a few minutes. I assume I would have the same problem on an airplane or other firm surface. This might not be a problem for a someone who never naps in a recliner or who is tall. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; and my skull lays where the recliner&#x27;s headrest crests. Bottom line, the sturdy band is the trade-off for flatter but less-durable elastic. I wish I had found this mask when I was deployed in Afghanistan but better now than never. A mostly-comfortable, sturdy mask that fits and blocks the light is the thing. Quality sleep is precious everywhere!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good quality. Made of satin material. My only complaint is the size. This this is huge. It wraps around your whole head and it&#x27;s kind of thick. I was looking for something to cover just my eyes...not my eyes, cheeks, ears and the back of my head. But if you are looking for 100% blackout this is your best bet. The velcro is adjustable. But i have a fairly large head and its almost too big on me. So probably not good for small heads.</li>
    <li> Falling asleep has been a constant issue as I work nights and often sleep in the early morning hours. I am pleased with this product as it has helped my sleep tremendously.</li>
    <li> My sleep is transformed! Best sleeping mask ever!!</li>
    <li> I can see why they show this product on a woman&#x27;s face.  It just barely fits over my head.  I wear a 7 3/8&amp;#34; hat and this mask is adjusted out to the max.  It is very comfortable, but it doesn&#x27;t work well on a big guys head.  I would give it five stars if I were a woman and had a smaller head, because it is excellent is all other respects.</li>
    <li> Works really well, but I wish the straps were a bit longer to fit around my hair,</li>
    <li> This item works well at keeping the light out but it is very big and bulky. Feels nice on the eyes! I have used other sleep masks with elastic bands that always stretch. This one keeps its shape well.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this for my girlfriend and she loves it!  She is a very light sleeper and has tried numerous masks in the past.  Some have worked well, but this is, by far, her favorite.  It is puffy and soft, and wraps around the ears as well, blocking some noise and keeping earbuds in.  I highly recommend this to all sensitive sleepers out there!</li>
    <li> ...but when it comes to sleep, and you&#x27;re having trouble - whether it be too much light in the room, or the TV in the next room your roommate is watching at 2AM - then you don&#x27;t want to go cheap, not when it&#x27;s something as important as your health. This product is worth the dough and even exceeded my expectations. It&#x27;s not uncomfortable sleeping with and the fabric feels nice against my skin. Now if you sleep on your back with your face toward the ceiling, yeah, that may be a problem because you would be able to feel where the velcro straps the sides - but what the hell&#x27;s wrong with you, sleep on your side, man! Or at least tilt your head, geez. Anyways, this Sleep Master has possibly saved my roommate&#x27;s life because now I can sleep soundly and doze off in just a few minutes. Thanks, Sleep Master!</li>
    <li> This mask didn&#x27;t work for me - it kept falling off and wasn&#x27;t worth the price.  It was well made but unfortunately, I could not make it work for me.</li>
    <li> Love it! Well worth the extra money. Can tell its high quality immediately. Very happy! Don&#x27;t waste your time like I did over the years buying substandard &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; sleep masks.  You&#x27;ll pay twice as much in the long run and will never receive the maximum benefits as you will with a high quality mask like this. Need I say more?</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is very large and made of a nice silky material.  I like that it has a velcro closure, because the elastic bands usually make my head hurt.  I&#x27;m not quite sure it was worth the price, but it is super comfy and helps block out light in the morning.  However, the major drawback is that without elastic bands it moves around way more easily.  It&#x27;s not too much of a problem since it&#x27;s so big, but without fastening the velcro tight (in which case it would press down on your eyes), this mask is just bound to slip around.  If you move around a lot in your sleep it might even come off completely.</li>
    <li> Upon starting a swing shift job, I needed a sleep mask that was more reliable than the one I bought from our local drugstore.  My sister got this one for me as a gift, with some guidance from me.  Well, the *description* had everything I wanted.  It&#x27;s smooth/soft, thick enough to block light without too much weight, and can even dampen sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It.Just.Doesn&#x27;t.Fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking back at the main picture, the sleep mask is stretched so tight across that woman&#x27;s face that you can see pucker marks where her eyes would be.  That&#x27;s how tight it has to be in order to block light below the nose opening, since it&#x27;s no more than a slit.  This quickly causes terrible headaches &amp; sinus pain, for me.  In addition, I must have a weird-shaped head, because with zero elasticity, I can&#x27;t keep this mask on for more than an hour.  If it&#x27;s positioned to actually block all light, then the velcro ends up being on the \\&quot;widest\\&quot; part of the back of my head, and it&#x27;s only a matter of time before it slips down or up.  I can fasten the velcro lower and it stays put...but then tons of light comes in by the nose slit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the guarantee advertised by the manufacturer, 30 days is not enough.  As a gift, the time was up immediately.  [*****EDIT:  I assumed a return would be impossible, since the deadline had passed quite a while ago.  In fact, when my sister contacted the company, they immediately worked with her and within a couple days I had shipped the old mask back and she received a full refund.  Great customer service - adding an extra 2 stars since the \\&quot;risk\\&quot; is so low!*****]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The material and filling truly are nice, but the design doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> This mask is extremely hot to wear during sleeping if you live in warmer climates. It makes my face sweaty. Also it doesn&#x27;t help at all with blocking out sound. I&#x27;m currently looking for a breathable fabric mask and I use earplugs to solve the sound issue.  This mask is like wearing a quilt over your face. It also is very long in the nose area and tends to feel like it is pushing against my nose - making me feel like I am being suffocated. It is one size only and if you have a small face, this runs rather large.</li>
    <li> My wife has gone through quite a few brands and styles of sleep masks, and she considers this model by far the most comfortable and effective.  She only wishes that she had picked this model up first, rather than first going through the slightly cheaper and significantly less effective alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask is large, yet not heavy, and fully blocks light, plus muffling sound, without being too thick.  The smooth outer material means the user does not suffer from excessive warmth, as happens with some other masks.  Likewise, the rear strap is comfortable, unlike many other models, and not disruptive for individuals who like to sleep on their backs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Significant secure adjustability results in ease of use for both myself, with a rather small head, and my wife, with a rather large head.  This is truly an example of a product for which a slightly higher cost means significantly higher effectiveness and comfort.  I highly and heartily recommend it!</li>
    <li> This item is great for back sleepers and if you want the sounds muffled.  They do not block sounds out altogether unless you use the included ear plugs which I do not, but the mask itself does block out the light.  A tad bulky for side sleep, it is great if you want to just sleep on your back.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to receiving this mask. I was very disappointed.  First,  while the ads do say works with a CPAP, my fit did NOT.  Could not get the mask tight enuff on my face for a good seal.  Also, secondly, the mask does not breath.  Try wearing this on a normal, un air-conditioned night (for me in the desert, minimal humidity) .  The sweat builds up, pours off, soaks the mask and makes breathing difficult.  I would dread an un air conditioned nite in NY, WDC or Memphis.  No thank you.  After wearing it for a week or so.  I returned it.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it again if the manufacturer gave me $25.00 to take it!</li>
    <li> This was my first sleeping mask and for a steep $25, I was expecting it to change my life...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did. This mask cuts out 100% of light. and the earplugs cut out 90% of noise. my fiance works closing shifts at the movie theater sometimes and so there are occasions where she won&#x27;t be home until 2AM. I always go to sleep at 11PM because I work mornings all the time. regardless of how long I&#x27;ve been asleep, her actions no longer wake me up. We share a small apartment and the computer is right next to the bed. and the bed is about 15 feet from the kitchen. my fiance is able to read email (and facebook, which I don&#x27;t do), cook herself a snack, and shower and whatever before bed and none of that wakes me anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I woke up the other day not knowing what time it was, and I figured at first that it was about 5AM because it was so dark. I remembered I had the sleeping mask on and I took it off to check my watch. I was caught by surprise when I saw the sun was way up and it was 10AM already. This was one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made from Amazon in at least 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;on a side note, the fabric is very soft. I was expecting the shape of the mask, being so large, to make it hard to get comfortable but that is so not the case here. I can barely notice its presence and I fall asleep much faster these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT (9/20/2013): I traveled overseas this summer and left it somewhere. Purchasing a new one of these was one of the first things I had to do when I came home (it arrived quickly). I will continue buying this product in particular over other brands as it has never failed to do an outstanding job.</li>
    <li> This is just awesome. You might be like \\&quot;Man, $25 is a lot to pay for just a piece of fabric over my face...\\&quot; Well don&#x27;t think that. It kind of is, but you&#x27;ve probably tried one of those dollar store eye masks or a bandanna or something like me. They just fall off at night, don&#x27;t breathe quite right, and you wake up with it around your neck or on the floor or flung across the room. This mask will not do any of that. It&#x27;ll sit tight all night long, blocking out that obnoxious moon light or the awful streetlamp right outside of your window. Does your neighbor shine a flood light directly into your window? Get this to avoid speaking to the inconsiderate jerk. Scared of waking up in the middle of the night with the feeling that &#x27;something&#x27; is watching you? Get this and you&#x27;ll wake up and see nothing and go back to sleep peacefully. Remember, if you can&#x27;t see it, it can&#x27;t see you.</li>
    <li> This sleeping mask is much more comfortable and effective than any other I have used.  The wraparound style keeps it in place and the coverage over the ears muffles sounds.  A highly recommend sleep mask from a highly recommended seller!</li>
    <li> Nice sleep mask, but it&#x27;s by no mean &amp;#34;Revolutionary&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;The noise reduction is pretty useless (not sure why do they claim such thing).&lt;br /&gt;As for the mask, you need few times to get used to it. Once you do, it&#x27;ll be a nice comfortable one.</li>
    <li> All I can say is the mask is a giant help, I really have to sleep during the day so I can be at my best at work on the night shift and this Mask works, well worth the money spent. This is one sleep aid that will pay for itself in no time. Get it you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other sleep masks, but this one is definitely the best!  It&#x27;s very soft, and instead of having a strap, the whole thing wraps around your head.  I can&#x27;t get over just how comfortable it is!  It&#x27;s easy to use with headphones as well.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Great nights sleep with this wonderful sleep mask ... Very comfortable ... An excellent feel to it ... Well-made ...</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading the positive #1 ranked review. I also read the negative ones but thought with so many 5 star those people were probably just being overly negative. Plus the first review covers so many point in a way to make them seem invalid.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t get overly hot in the mask but I could see how someone could. The mask does fit my head but I would say for a woman or smaller to average size, I can see how it might not fit a lot of men the Velcro part is NOT that long. My problem with it is that to have it on securely it is tight across the eyes. I don&#x27;t usually keep it on all night just while hubby watches tv but I do know pressure on your eyes can cause temporary blurry vision. Second problem I have is that it is so thick across the back of my head with two layers of padding and the strips of Velcro making kind of a hard place in the center I find it uncomfortable to sleep with it secured. If I move position in bed I usually have to readjust the mask secured or not. I do like how well it blocks light for me and I like that it covers my ears because I have a thing about sleeping without my ears covered lol. But I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price. I gave 3 stars instead of only two because I do not have all the problems some have experienced but I do have some issues with it.</li>
    <li> I love this mask fits my face well an is soft and comfortable.  I work thirds so I sleep during the day.</li>
    <li> My sleep quality is way better with this ... because I seem to sleep way better in dark room ... via this misk.&lt;br /&gt;It is very soft and effective.</li>
    <li> The are very comfortable. they block out most of the light and even cover  your ears. they are adjustable for all sizes.</li>
    <li> I got this face mask after reading the reviews. I am glad I did! This covers a lot more of your face, and it&#x27;s very comfortable. It doesn&#x27;t ride up like most face masks do, and the back of it doesn&#x27;t hurt my head and isn&#x27;t lumpy at all. It&#x27;s not tight across the nose, which is really nice, as it does graze the top part of your nose since it is so wide. It is great if you have to sleep during the day or it gets bright early and dark late.</li>
    <li> The mask is very comfortable. I was worried about it slipping off from one of the reviews I read because I have a small head so I was worried that the velcro wouldnt go far enough for me, but I managed to get it on just right and it does not slip off. I loved the added bonus with the earplugs, I did not know it would come with those which was a nice surprise. Overall, the sleep mask works perfectly and muffles sound and light perfectly for me helping me fall asleep faster. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I used to have a cheap smaller drug store mask but I lost it. The store I shop at didn&#x27;t carry them anymore so I checked on amazon and these came up. thought heck my sleep is worth $20 what do i have to lose? I am very pleased with the results just after the first night. They came with a free pair of earplugs which I don&#x27;t normally use because they fall out when I&#x27;m sleeping for some reason. but this mask goes around your head and ears which further dampened the sound and kept the earplugs in.</li>
    <li> This product is nothing special and not really worth the cash. It does nothing to reduce sound.I will keep searching for something better.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd one! Amazing help when I sleep. But the last one I ordered seemed to be of different texture/quality than the first 2, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a 4 start not 5. I think the company might have changed their materials a bit :( but it&#x27;s still an awesome product and I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works awesome! I don&#x27;t use the earplugs as the wrap covers the ears and is enough by itself. Getting a good night sleep!</li>
    <li> This mask is comfortable, blocks out all the light, (typically) stays on my head (I move around a lot) but the best feature for me is that it helps to reduce the dryness in my eyes overnight.  I usually wake up with my eyes feeling like I&#x27;ve been up all night, but when wearing this mask, things are much improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  Great shopping experience. Would purchase again. I love this sleep mask.</li>
    <li> Not so thrilled with this mask.  I used it for a week and it keeps slipping down my face and ends up around my neck.  I try to tighten it and it still slips.  Eventually, I will have to add more velcro to make it stay.  It is so big it feels too large on my face.  I can&#x27;t really recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Greatly reduces unwanted noise.</li>
    <li> These are very comfortable due to the plush inside. They truly keep the light out and are easily positioned with the velcro straps. Have a pair at home and one to travel that is always packed.</li>
    <li> Love this mask! It fits all sizes &amp; is very comfortable. I did find it a bit warm a couple nights during the summer. However it is So soft and comfortable. It has some sound deflection as well. Though I must say because I&lt;br /&gt;Live in the city I still need additional ear plugs. Those are easily worn in combination. My mask has also been washed&lt;br /&gt;Several times, cold water, drip dry. I have tried many masks this is the Very Best.</li>
    <li> do the job but slide off</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what these would be like, but was looking for a new sleep mask.  First time fell in love with them.  Still crazy about them.  Gonna buy another just as a backup.  So soft and blocks out light.  The only negative would be the close proximity to your face does tend to absorb lotion on my face.  So now let lotion set in before bed.  But the sleep mask is easy to wash too.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed after the glowing reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask covers over the ears. This is awful for two separate reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1- Because it doesn&#x27;t hook over the ears, it slides up and down during the night. Tightening the mask is possible, but then it becomes uncomfortable squeezing the head. Either it has to be a death grip to hold it in place, or it slides if it&#x27;s at a comfortable tightness and thus lets in light, which defeats the purpose of wearing the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2- Because it&#x27;s pressing against the ears, every single movement creates a ton of noise. This mask is made out of multiple materials, and these materials rub against each other with every movement. The noise is right on top of the ears and makes it impossible to actually fall asleep if you ever move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d only recommend this to people who never move when they&#x27;re sleeping. Sadly I move a lot, and the mask was just unusable for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my sister&#x27;s birthday and she absolutely loved it.She said it is the most comfortable sleep mask she ever had on.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it....It is comfortable, soft, and he has been sleeping much better... He works overnight... He has tried many masks nd is very picky, so for him to give this a good rating speaks alot...I based my decision off other reviews on this mask. So thank you</li>
    <li> Comfortable and effective</li>
    <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I had been searching for a sleep mask that would be comfortable and also muffle noise. This seemed like it would be great based on the product description and reviews, but it is not at all worth the money. It didn&#x27;t diminish sounds and the satin material doesn&#x27;t breathe well. And most importantly, it didn&#x27;t even manage to keep out all of the light.</li>
    <li> Great sleep mask. Very thick and soft and I especially like how it covers both your ears, all of your eye area and it is held together in the back by velcro which does not stretch like the elastic on local our pharmacy&#x27;s eye masks and fall off your face. I would highly recommend this product. It is worth the price you pay.</li>
    <li> The Sleep Master is my favorite sleep mask.  It keeps things dark and peaceful throughout the night.  I don&#x27;t stir so much so I feel more rested on awakening than with other masks I&#x27;ve used. Also, it washes well.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.......Just as described........LOVE the sleep mask!!......Works like a &#x27;DREAM&#x27;!!! (No Pun Intended, LOL).....  Highly recommend this sleep mask.....and believe me, I know all about them.  Been using sleepmasks for years, and this is by far the cream of the crop!  It&#x27;s wide enough to block out all the light.  And it covers the ears, which is an added bonus to muffle sound!!  Thank You SLEEP MASTER!!  :-)</li>
    <li> Very comfortable.  Blocks light well.  Some light comes in through the nose area, but is virtually nothing compared to other sleep mask products.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve probably owned a dozen or more sleep masks over the years, and this is by FAR the best one I have ever owned!  The wide band covers my ears (which I do still use ear plugs), and once I set the velcro on the back to fit comfortably - I can simply slide it up off my head in the morning so I don&#x27;t have to adjust it every night.  The material is very comfortable, and the fact that it can be WASHED is a huge plus (as that has been a HUGE problem with every other mask I&#x27;ve owned, with the elastic going to hell or the material otherwise not standing up to being hand-washed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this the most expensive sleep mask I&#x27;ve ever bought?  Yes - but I honestly think this might be the last sleep mask I&#x27;ll ever have to buy.  I&#x27;ve spent as little as a few bucks and as much as $12 before this - and they were all pretty much disposable (might be lucky to get a year or two out of any of them).  While that is a pretty long time for something inexpensive - I think this would likely last far longer (and work better in the process).  Definitely recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I got these for my boyfriend, they cover eyes perfectly and stay cool throughout the night. I recommend these for anyone who has to sleep during the day.</li>
    <li> My daughter asked for a sleep mask at college since she is in a quad with 3 roomates and late night studying for someone is the norm.  After researching products I decided on this one, it may at first seem like a little more to spend but when I factored in the free S&amp;H the price to the other ones was close enough to go for the better mask.  I am 100% glad I did as she loves it and sleeps with it every night.  I would not hesitate to get another one for my son when he heads off to college next year so that is saying a lot.  I would not hesitate to use this company again with the very fast shipping you cannot go wrong!</li>
    <li> The mask is very comfortable and effectively blocks light out, but it&#x27;s too expensive for what it is, and it invariably slips off while I&#x27;m asleep.</li>
    <li> If ever there were a candidate for a sleep mask, it would be me. A full side of my bedroom are sliding glass doors leading to a balcony that faces south. As soon as the sun rises my room is full of light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the Sleep Master to be perfect when I first got it. There was little adjustment period from my previous towel or shirt over the eyes method. (Then again, anything would have been an improvement over that.) But after about 90 days the velcro began ripping away from the mask in a way that can&#x27;t be fixed with Super Glue or by replacing the velcro. I&#x27;m now ready to order another sleeping mask and I doubt it will be the Sleep Master.</li>
    <li> Everyone says that they have tried every sleep mask. If this is not their favorite, I would accuse them of being disingenuous, or clearly have not tried this one. I travel a lot for work, and blocking out light is critical to my sleep (I&#x27;m a highly sensitive person). This mask is darker than the bottom of a cave, below a cenoté in South America. Other masks wear out and the bands get loose. This mask is sorta gridlocked to your face, but not in a BDSM sort of way. I&#x27;ve heard people say that this mask is a struggle with a larger nose, but I&#x27;m half Irish and have a half smushed in face anyway. It only seems to slip off when I am drunk and put it on backwards, which is half my Irish thing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this mask against any other. It&#x27;s cool to the skin, tight-fitting and only when I&#x27;ve had a little too much spirit water to drink and need to sleep for twelve hours does it stick to my eyelids.</li>
    <li> This is the only sleep mask I am able to wear and it stays on all night.  The ones with eye patches and elastic bands usually either come off or the band breaks.</li>
    <li> When the strap is adjusted so that it stays on my head, the front of the mask is pulled so that it presses into my eyes.  The notch for my nose is not long enough to allow the mask to fit so that light doesn&#x27;t come in at the bottom.  The slick fabric allows the mask to shift so that it doesn&#x27;t stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure this all has to do with my head shape and sleeping habits.  But for me personally, this mask is far from the best.</li>
    <li> This is so much better then just buying a plain old eye mask. No light gets through at all and it helps reduce noise as well. 2 for the price of 1 I think.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT ITEM--VERY SOFT --MY WIFE LOVES THIS MASK--- HELPS HER SLEEP IN THE DAYTIME VERY NICE AND COMFORTABLY--EXCELLENT PRODUCT--RECOMMEND HIGHLY</li>
    <li> This thing is great for me. My significant other gets up at 3am for work which is rather disruptive for me who doesn&#x27;t get up til later. This mask keeps the light down to minimum and actually evens buffers sound a little bit. It&#x27;s definitely nothing like ear plugs, but it takes the edge off for me. My only complaint about this is that because it&#x27;s pretty thick it is also a bit hot. If you struggle with being too hot at night, I would not suggest this at all unless you can ignore your upper face being rather warm. It was annoying to me at first, but the light was worse so I learned to deal with it.</li>
    <li> Had a sleep mask from eagle creek for many years but couldn&#x27;t find it to buy again.  Saw the reviews on this one and thought to give it a try.  Very comfortable and does not get your face not.  You do need to fit it snugly or it will shift a bit on your face.</li>
    <li> I Love my new sleep mask!!! Its light yet cuts all the light out.  I have rested better since using it.  Thank you to whom ever envented it.</li>
    <li> I have the world&#x27;s smallest head.  I&#x27;ve installed foam weather-stripping inside hat bands habitually to keep the hat from falling over my eyes.  Yet, this masque fits perfectly.  It has a velcro closure and stays secure all night.  I&#x27;ve worn it with hair left down and loose or piled up, and the strap adjusts to fit either way and hold the masque in place comfortably.  It covers the ears also, which gives a bit of sound muffling, like burying your head under a silk comforter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The masque&#x27;s wider design literally is easy on the eyes, whereas others have caused blurred vision the next morning, or pain from too tight a fit over the eye socket - like thumbs in your eyeballs all night (American Airlines, I&#x27;m talking to you.)  Smooth silk satin fabric doesn&#x27;t catch the hair or cause tangles.  It feels breathable against the skin, so should work as well in summer heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would work well for blocking light during migraine, as it is light-weight enough and applies no extra pressure to extra-sensitive areas, and keeps out daylight pretty completely.  Last, an added benefit is that the light padding acts as a bumper guard against early morning kitty head-butts and paw probes...  Very nice!</li>
    <li> I work the nightshift and use this mask to sleep during the day. It works very well but can be a little uncomfortable on the bridge of the nose, if not positioned correctly. It also blocks out sound somewhat to allow for a good rest and keeps your ears warm when it&#x27;s cold. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love my new sleep mask. Bought it as a christmas present for my husband who has trouble sleeping and hates wearing ear plugs. He usually finds everything uncomfortable, but he loves the mask. I find myself stealing it too! Really works!</li>
    <li> I am very light sleeper, whenever I have light on my room I just cant sleep well. In addition, I have a alot of sleeping problem during travelling as I have no control on room or the place that I would sleep in.&lt;br /&gt;I had tried many sleeping masks &amp; goggles but none of them where comfortable. After reading reviews about this item I deciede to invest in it and try it out.&lt;br /&gt;I liked that the size that you control it your self, the fabric has a feeling of silk, and it covers your ears as well (I tend to cover my ears with hands sometimes).&lt;br /&gt;It worth the investment and very much comfortable.</li>
    <li> Believe me when I tell you this - I&#x27;ve tried them all.  I LOVE this mask!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more straps pulling down on my ears, or some lump at the back of my head where the straps meet. It actually blocks out the light AND covers your ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT product!</li>
    <li> My wife has trouble sleeping due to us being on a different work schedule. I like to watch t.v. to wind down after work but it keeps my wife awake at nights. The sleep master mask drowns out the light and sound due to the t.v. and let&#x27;s her get a comfortable nights sleep. She had an inferior mask from another manufacturer that was uncomfortable and just did not hold up after time. She is thrilled with how comfortable and well made the sleep master mask is which makes us both happy. Thanks sleep master mask!</li>
    <li> The sleep mask works and is comfortable.  It will fall off sometime during the night but that is after I fall asleep.</li>
    <li> I have purchased numerous sleep masks, and this one is by far the best I have ever used! It is very soft and gentle on your skin. An added bonus is that it also covers your ears to block out noise. I love that it doesn&#x27;t shift like other masks do while you sleep. In addition, some masks will leave marks on your face after you wake up due to shifting during your sleep. This mask is like butter, and blocks light better than any I have ever tried. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> It turns out that long eyelashes run in our family,  I bough the mask for my college freshman daughter to use at her 24/7 dormitory.  But, her eyelashes and the mask&#x27;s snug fit make it uncomfortable.  A design tweak to give the eye area a little extra room would make it better.  That would be revolutionary.</li>
    <li> This is the best sleep mask I&#x27;ve ever owned.  A lot of times I wear it kind of high on the back of my head so it doesn&#x27;t cover my ears though, but that&#x27;s just more comfortable for me.  If there is unwelcome noise I will pull it over my ears where it helps slightly to muffle (but not block) the sound.  It&#x27;s very effective at blocking light, and very comfortable too and breathes well.  It&#x27;s easy to wash and hang dry.  The Velcro closure on the back makes it easily adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To save time on washing it too often, I will use one side, then flip it around and use the other.  Overall a very nice product that I get a lot of use out of and it helps me sleep better for sure.  I can&#x27;t stand to have light hitting my eyes when sleeping.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. It is just as described as in the description part, even better... You don&#x27;t even feel that on your face. It is so soft and comfortable. It totally blocks lights and reduces sounds so you&#x27;ll have the best sleeping experience with a sleeping mask.</li>
    <li> Overall it is a good product, it is hypoallergenic and you can hand wash it. Sometimes it falls off in the middle of the night but it stays on after many uses</li>
    <li> This particular mask fits well, BUT it not contoured over the eyes.  To get a good solid fit, it smashes against the eyeballs.  NEVER buy one without the contoured eye area.</li>
    <li> I am a rotating shift worker and as I get older daytime sleep becomes more difficult. White noise is also very important here. I have owned one other sleep mask before this one and this Sleep Master is no comparison. It is soft and wide and very comfortable. It will slip a little during sleep but any mask will. The V notch for the nose makes it easily put back in place. It does block out some noise but what is best is if you do wear ear plugs under it it cushions them when you lay on your side so your ears won&#x27;t be sore. Well worth the money, will definitely buy another one when needed and telling my co-workers as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mask for years now, so much so that I wanted to have a second for a back up while I was washing the other or as a travel mask. It&#x27;s so soft and large enough to cover both my eyes and ears. I don&#x27;t even know I&#x27;m wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really helps me shut my mind off and keep the light out. Since I started wearing this mask, I fall asleep quicker and stay asleep longer. Win, win!</li>
    <li> Sleep Master sleep mask is comfortable, soft, and very adjustable.  It was recommended on a website which listed best things for college-bound kids to have at college.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this eye mask based on reviews as a gift for me because I have to sleep with an eye mask. I have several pairs of cheap ones that have worn over the years, mainly due to the elastic bands losing their elasticity. This is my impression of the sleep mask:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) At first, it seems very comfortable and silky.&lt;br /&gt;2) It&#x27;s definitely larger than most other sleep masks.&lt;br /&gt;3) It fits fine on my head, but covers up my ears, which I actually don&#x27;t like, since I&#x27;m used to traditional eye masks that simply cover the eyes. I wish there was a cut-out for the ears.&lt;br /&gt;4) You do get some light coming in from the nose area. I enjoy the cushion under the eyes on other eye masks because they help to block out more light from underneath..&lt;br /&gt;5) It constantly moves around on my head while I&#x27;m adjusting to fall asleep because the velcro is in the back and there&#x27;s no strap. This is a big negative for me. I end up trying it for a few minutes, constantly adjusting it, and then give up and go back to a cheap pair that I have in my drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the bottom line - it seems well-made, but didn&#x27;t work for me in terms of overall comfort. A shame because I really wanted to like it.</li>
    <li> Love it but it took more time than it was supposed to be...</li>
    <li> Soft easy on the eyes. I can sleep better now</li>
    <li> This is a very comfortable addition to my sleeping ensemble, and worth the seemingly high price tag.  The material is soft, totally locks out light, and the padding is extremely comfortable.  When combined with a good set of earplugs in mornings after my graveyard shift, this sleep mask makes me feel like I&#x27;m on another planet, let alone sleeping at night time.</li>
    <li> This mask is great! I put it on and almost all light is blocked out. Best part is that I can reverse it for comfort. I have trouble sleeping but when I put this on it&#x27;s lights out.</li>
    <li> Im a light-on sleeper and sometimes I woke up at 3 or 4 am and that is annoying. so I decided to give this mask a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its large and comfortable, covers most of the light and even isolate some of the air conditioner sound. I definitely sleep better with this mask. No more black eye in the morning yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It slip off my face a few times so Im not gonna say its the best design, but for a sleep mask this thing does the job really well.</li>
    <li> Exactly as promised, a soft, comfortable sleep mask that I feel performs brilliantly. It is very effective at cutting out light. I liked the wide, soft band as well, which didn&#x27;t catch my hair, and covered my ears, a special benefit for me, as I have a quirk about needing my ears covered when I sleep. The mask alone will not block noise; use with earplugs. I am delighted with this sleep mask.</li>
    <li> Best sleep mask I&#x27;ve ever used. It doesn&#x27;t squish my eyes like some and doesn&#x27;t fall off. Having it cover my ears helps eliminate small noises that would wake me up.</li>
    <li> Comfortable, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> This is the second sleep mask from Sleep Master that we have purchased.  My boyfriend has a hard time sleeping if there is any light and this mask helps a great deal.  The mask holds tightly on his head, doesn&#x27;t bunch up in the back so he can sleep on his back without issue, and it is soft on his eyes.  He lost his old one when we moved.  I plan to get one for myself as well. The seller sent the item ahead of schedule and it was in the condition described (new).  Love it!</li>
    <li> My son uses this every night. He uses earplugs and it keeps them in his ears. He has a large head and it fits fine. I asked him to get a mask for me since he liked his so much. This sleep mask is a must-have for anyone who meditates. It blocks out all light and is very silky comfortable, I also use it if I want to snooze for ten minutes in my easy chair. I love it and recommend it.</li>
    <li> Yes, these are overpriced. Yes, the patent IMHO is a bit questionable. But if you want the best sleep mask, way ahead of all others this is it. It&#x27;s well made, comfortable, and blocks every bit of light. The sound-dampening properties are marginal, but this is the best sleep mask you can get.</li>
    <li> The fabric is comfortable but this thing is very large and heavy. The fabric is supposed to feel cool, which it does to the touch, but the overall item is very think and insulating. My whole head heats up which is no good for sleeping. It is good at keeping out light and sound but it completely covers the ears which makes me hear my own pulse in my ears. This is a weird phenomenon and I cant sleep with this sensation. This kind of item is definitely better for some people than others. Personally, I have not found it helpful.</li>
    <li> The best ever.  The other dozen kinds I have tried previously are going in the trash.  Ordering more now for gifts.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Not as pictured and not satisfactory! Picture showed soft fabric. Mask received was blue plastic . Not a comfortable sleep aid!</li>
    <li> i have always had problems with smaller mask the type air lines give away, this met my expectation and more i find it very comfortable and snugs correctly to your head and it stays in place</li>
    <li> I supposed it does have some \\&quot;pros\\&quot; to it, however, I consider it a total waste of money.  Yes, it&#x27;s soft with no light peeking through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask is very uncomfortable for a side sleeper.  Every time I turned, it would slid about or come off completely.  The only way to somewhat eliminate the problem is to tighten the mask creating pressure on the eyeballs.  I end up removing this mask within an hour or too.  Very disturbing to a good sleep.</li>
    <li> I bought this because im a night shift worker and the main problem that i have with this is that it doesnt stay on very well. when i roll from side to side, i have to readjust it it or else it will be very crooked on my face and light will come in. not to mention light alright comes in from the nose area. and it also falls off every night because its not very secure from the back of the head. and lastly, its bulky. so ill also wake up sweating around the eyes the few times it actually does stay on. it is not worth the $25 i paid for it.</li>
    <li> The service is awesome - fast shipping, product as described. I just doesn&#x27;t work for me. The back where the velcro holds it together is too thick and feels like sleeping on a pony tail. It hurts my neck to have my head lifted like that. It doesn&#x27;t work for me. If I try to position the velcro up higher then it pushes on my eyes. Maybe if I was primarily a side sleeper it would be ok, but I typically sleep on my back.</li>
    <li> All things arrived quickly and without problems. Love this mask. Blocks out all light and doesn&#x27;t get too hot. And on the unexpected side; it doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on your face when you wake up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very impressed by the Sleep Master Mask and I&#x27;m one of those guys who is very critical of these kinds of products.  I tried my girlfriend&#x27;s Sleep Master Mask about two months ago after I complained to her about trouble sleeping - especially with the slightest bit of noise and light.  I was skeptical at first - I thought how can you sleep with an annoying mask on?  Wow, I was amazed at how quick I fell asleep and how comfortable the Sleep Master mask was - it wasn&#x27;t annoying at all, in fact it was enjoyable to the senses and has an instant calming effect. I have since bought two - one for at home and the other I use for travel for business or pleasure.  I don&#x27;t want to be without this product and risk not getting my sleep!  Like I said, I was highly skeptical before trying the Sleep Master Mask but now I&#x27;ve recommended it to friends, work colleagues, and family - those that have tried it like it if not love it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought and tried numerous eye masks to block out the light on planes and in the bedroom.  I&#x27;ve tried the cheap, throw-away versions, I&#x27;ve tried the expensive ones.  Some have been comfortable but not effective.  Some have been effective but not comfortable.  The Sleep Master mask is both THE MOST comfortable and THE MOST effective!!  It has been used virtually every night for past 5 months and shows ZERO signs of wear.  Extremely happy customer!  :)</li>
    <li> It does it&#x27;s job. The issue with the back poking your head is caused by not properly fastening it. I like it because i listen to white noise or hypnosis etc. and this holds my ear buds in. Does not cancel noise but actually stays on my head unlike the elastic band ones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a ton of sleep masks. None have been perfect but this one is close. Very comfortable and blocks almost all or the light out.</li>
    <li> Best night&#x27;s sleep ever, love it!</li>
    <li> Its the best one I have ever tried. Blocks the light by your nose better than the cheap ones. The things I dont care for are: It slips around easily when you sleep because the fabric is so smooth. (But it is soft so it has that going for it. It has the same fabric on the inside as the outside.) Also the Velcro in the back is somewhat bulkier than just having an elastic band--to me its noticable but I can live with it. I do like that its adjustable though. I feel its over priced... I paid $50 for 2! I feel a better price would be $15 each as its just an eye mask... I pretty nice one but still. I do appreciate that it&#x27;s made in the USA!</li>
    <li> This mask is the best I&#x27;ve used.  It is soft and comfortable and really blocks out all the light. It&#x27;s very well made and seems like it will last for a long time.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this item!  She found it to be awkward in the beginning, just because the wrap around feature of this mask is different than sleeping without a mask.  Nonetheless, in just a couple of nights she found it to be comfortable and aiding her in a better night&#x27;s rest.</li>
    <li> good. The earplug is working well.</li>
    <li> I got this sleep mask because light hitting my eyes in the night tends to start my day off with a migraine. I thought this would block the most light. It does block light very well, but the mask over my ears made so much crinkly noise. I&#x27;m a light sleeper and couldn&#x27;t sleep through it. I&#x27;m probably a minority though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, it DOES block the light out exceptionally well. So if it covering your ears doesn&#x27;t bother you, then get this one. I couldn&#x27;t get passed it though.</li>
    <li> This mask is awesome, I work until about 4 in the morning and it definitely helps with sleeping during the day!!! I received it as a gift at a friends party and I love it!!!</li>
    <li> it is soft. feels great. looks unique and elegant.  this is a wonderful item overall. I use it a lot.</li>
    <li> I am not one to write a review unless it is absolutely amazing and I can honestly say, this sleep mask is.  I have struggled with falling asleep and staying asleep for YEARS but with my first night with this mask, perfection.  With the velcro on the back, you can adjust it to fit your head.  The material is so soft and feels great on your face.  Lastly, it is large enough that no light leaks get it.  Cannot recommend it enough.</li>
    <li> My husband worked third shift for a few years. I bought him one mask and he liked it so much I bought another. His 88 year old mother recently took care of her dying husband who insisted on sleeping with a light on. So we leant her a mask. She loved it and we bought her one. This  product is simply the best!!</li>
    <li> Some customers write books, I cut straight to the chase:  Best item of this nature I&#x27;ve ever experienced in my 66 years. Soft, comfortable, adjustable, 100% pure DARK !!! Keeps both light and humanity out of your face. Well worth its price for what it provides.  In both the military (Colonel, US Army, Ret)and as a U.S. Diplomat for the Dept. of State, I&#x27;ve traveled extensively world-wide. Many is the time I&#x27;ve spent exhausted on overcrowded airplanes huddled under a cheesy blanket due to their wafer-then eye products, or none at all. I&#x27;m leaving to attend my Daughter&#x27;s graduation, and will put this to a real-world test outside of my bedroom. I&#x27;m confident it will provide the same quality experience I&#x27;ve had with it here at home since it arrived.  Thank you for finding such a useful tool and making it available to all.  Knightsix</li>
    <li> I never rate these transactions, but THIS was a TOTAL waste of money.  it&#x27;s not too bad in the front, it give good black out coverage but the velco closure makes a huge rock under your head if you&#x27;re a back sleeper (which I am).  I&#x27;ve gone back to my old sleep mask that costs around 7 bucks.  Not as effective around the nose but a heck of a lot more comfortable.</li>
    <li> The first time I wore the mask I had great satisfaction. However, after multiple use, the eyemask&#x27;s design began to take effect on my eyeballs. They are now hurting the area directly above the eye. I believe that long-term use of this eyemask will be detrimental to our vision.</li>
    <li> Okay, may be that is a bit of a corny headline, but it is the truth. Over the years I&#x27;ve wasted much money at drug stores on flimsy blindfolds. Too thin, ill-fitting, the straps stretch out or break. This is unlike any blindfold I have ever had. The wrap around design keeps it in place as does the Velcro ® closure. This will not come off during the night (or on occasions during the day when napping) and you are not going to get the dreaded light around the edges. Paired with ear plugs (included) you get a great rest. It may be a little more costly than those you will find at the corner drug store, but it so worth the price and it is going to last a lot longer too.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help when I have a migraine and just want to be in complete darkness.  It is SUPER SOFT, completely covers the eyes and ears, so it is perfect for those days you just need to escape into a quiet, dark room and sleep the pain away.  My ONLY complaint is that the velcro closure in the back is a tiny bit bulky.  However, as migraine sufferers know, the smallest little thing like that will irk you when you are in that kind of pain... I imagine it really isn&#x27;t that bad, but is probably magnified by the pain.  Just something to consider as you contemplate the purchase.</li>
    <li> This seems OK, but also seems very bulky compared to other sleep masks in the same category.  Hard to find a good adjustment point where it stays on my head while sleeping, but not being too tight. It does cover the ears, and really doesn&#x27;t do anything to block out the noise, so it seems like it&#x27;s just too much material.</li>
    <li> I bought this sleep mask a couple of years ago. I am now about to order another one. It is the best one I have ever had, and after purchasing several other masks before this one, I stopped after this one. I finally found my sleep mask for life. I work third shift, and my decor does not call for black out drapes in my huge many window bedroom. Therefore, a sleep mask is a must for my situation. I am merely buying another one for travel. I have lost items before, and I fear if I keep taking this on vacations with me, I will eventually lose it. So I made up my mind to go ahead and spend a little money for my mask security. I do understand that this mask is not for everyone, but for me, it is the one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add: Be sure to pull the back down just below the skull. This helps keep the mask secure, and not slip around very much. The covering of the ears with this mask is a plus, it will not eliminate sound, but it sure does muffle sound effectively.</li>
    <li> I have had many sleep masks over the years, and this one is by far the BEST one I have ever used!  Many of the over the counter ones are garbage, and basically consumable goods.  This one, unlike many of the cheap variety has no low-grade elastic bands, that will just eventually stretch out and disintegrate over time.  The Sleep Master uses velcro, which is easily adjustable to fit anyone&#x27;s head.  The satiny material feels spa grade to me.  The size of the face mask portion is larger than any that I have seen/used, and completely 100% blocks out any light.  I like the fact that the band can fit over your ears, which blocks out most annoying sounds, but still enables me to hear the baby monitor in my four month old&#x27;s room, and relaxing white noise, like the fan I have going when I sleep.  If you want more sound blocked out, the company also sent out a set of foam ear plugs which would definitely aide in noise reduction for sleep, or when your wife wants to talk to you about a \\&quot;honey do\\&quot; list.  I read a few reviews about this product, and some of the low ratings make no sense to me.  Complaining about a tag and having to cut it off?  Why not just reverse the mask so the tag is out of the way?  It is the exact same on both sides...  Complaining of the mask being thicker in the back?  Really?  I never noticed it, plus, most products are created with the majority in masses when produced.  Since the majority of people are side sleepers, this issue would only affect a few, and I have woken up in the morning some days on my back, and have NEVER noticed and discomfort of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have NO cons for this product, merely two small suggestions.  One, would be perhaps an option of a wider or deeper nose groove, for people with large noses like myself, and two, though it may not be cost effective, would be a way to make the areas that go over the eyes more of a cupped, egg shape, so the product is not pressed right up against your eye lids if you want to wear it tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!  Try it!  Love it as I do!</li>
    <li> I bought this sleep mask a week ago got it in on time and i&#x27;ve never had better. I can sleep without lights waking me up or my cats fur getting in my face.</li>
    <li> For sleep.  Earlier product more comfortable, breathes better, less bulk. I would probably use this more in the winter time</li>
    <li> I used this product for several nights, because I read in a magazine titled &amp;#34;What Doctors Don&#x27;t Tell You&amp;#34; that it is important to get enough darkness each day. It worked very well, but at some point it started irritating my eyes, so I stopped using it. You might not have this problem. The product is designed very well, fits comfortably, and works well.</li>
    <li> Will be sleeping an a bright hotel room in a few weeks and can give it a good tryout, but here at the house it was GREAT!</li>
    <li> I sleep with a sleeping mask every night and as it was time that I bought a new one, I tried these.  They lay flat against your eyes, preventing one from comfortably moving ones eyelids.  This is something that we do naturally.  This mask shifts every time I move my head, because it has a satiny finish all the way around.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mask based on the consumer reviews here at amazon.com.  I was not dissapointed! I had bought &amp; returned other masks because frankly, they did not even begin to block the light enough to sleep in my very bright bedroom. From the moment I put this mask on I was transported to the Sleep Zone. It has an almost hypnotic effect on me. It&#x27;s supremely comfortable - I forget it&#x27;s even on. I love how it blocks the noise - no more sleeping with a pillow over my head as I&#x27;ve been for many years. This masks provides the best sleep I&#x27;ve had in years. I sleep on my side and on my back &amp; it works perfectly. YAY Sleepmaster! It lives up to it&#x27;s name.</li>
    <li> Superb product, comfortable for a man or woman to wear, and with better than average ear plugs, too. Super comfortable after trying a dozen other brands -- well worth the price. Cannot praise the quality enough, as it really does block all the light, does not compress nasal passages for breathing, and really refreshes those tired eyes! Everyone over 30 should own a pair.  Using a Velcro type adjustment rather than elastic, as in most inferior products of this type, the Sleep Master is easily adjustable and remains comfortable all night long, rather than becoming less and less comfortable as time goes by.  Surprise your loved one(s) and definitely put this on your short list for the holidays!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mask for several weeks and it totally outperforms all the other masks&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried. Here are the major differences that make the mask my mask from now on:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s soft and light and cool - I forget I&#x27;m wearing it. It goes over the ears generously so&lt;br /&gt;your ears are not crushed or irritated while you sleep. This also aids in muffling sound&lt;br /&gt;for better sleep. It has a simple adjustable velcro strap so you can fine tune its fit and leave&lt;br /&gt;it there as your own custom fitting. One can also turn their head in different positions&lt;br /&gt;without having the mask lose effectiveness or comfort. What surprised me most was that while other masks&lt;br /&gt;try odd shapes and different thicknesses and try to make themselves stand out they really wind&lt;br /&gt;up being like all the other ones - clever solutions that don&#x27;t really apply to someone who just&lt;br /&gt;wants to cover their eyes to rest or sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely should be patented. I&#x27;d like to say I wish I thought of it but the truth is I&#x27;m just glad I have one!</li>
    <li> I like the idea of it but the way the velcro is sets up, it creates a bump in the back and makes it uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> This is the first non-airplane-issue sleep mask I&#x27;ve tried and am completely satisfied. It stays on very well and blocks the light. The best part for me, though, is that it covers the ears and helps block out any sound as well. A quality product.</li>
    <li> Best nights sleep I&#x27;ve had in a long time! The quality of workmanship with the Sleep Master mask is far superior than other ones I&#x27;ve tried that use cheap elastic straps and scratchy nylon. It&#x27;s also so comfortable that I forget it&#x27;s on. The extra bonus of this mask is the sound dampening effect from the wide sides covering my ears. I can&#x27;t praise this product enough.  Waking up in the morning feeling and looking rested make the Sleep Master mask worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase from Sleep Master. I bought one of these sleep masks for myself over a year ago. I had stumbled across their privately promoted site and after much browsing I decided this was the one. When I went to replace my worn out mask I typed in the old sites name and to my disappointment it was not pulling it up! I thought to myself surely these people have not stopped selling MY MASK I NEED IT. I typed Sleep Master into amazon.com search and my frustration went away quickly. I am happy for them that they are able to reach a wider range of potential customers because this product is really great.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to some molds. After about 4 days of wearing this mask, I started waking up with a stuffy nose. When I stopped wearing the mask, the stuffy nose went away. Very few sleep masks list the materials they are made from or provide washing instructions. I like the [[ASIN:B000CCI4YU Sweet Dreams Contoured Sleep Mask with Earplugs and Travel Pouch - Black]] because they list the materials: \\&quot;closed cell foam and nylon that is washable and quick drying.\\&quot; I did some research on the internet and found that while most foam does harbor mold, inside where it can&#x27;t be seen, closed cell foam should not.     I don&#x27;t keep my eyes closed all night, so I sometimes woke with very dry, uncomfortable eyes when wearing this mask. It felt as if they were in contact with the mask.     This mask also lets a little light in around the nose. Most of them do on me. The sound muffling feature (something sewn into the area over the ears) does not make much difference and makes the mask hotter to wear. The slippery fabric seems to make the mask slide around more than the others I have tried. I once woke to find it on the floor by the bed.    I have to say, it was comfortable to sleep on my back, and the mask is very large so it covers a lot of my face. It would might be good for someone with a larger face and no mold allergies.</li>
    <li> the mask sleeps well, blocks out light well, and fits around the face well. Up till now I was using a &#x27;makeshift&#x27; home made mask, now I no longer need it.  It definitely was not a comfortable at this mask.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a college student whose room mate is less than ideal. I have to go to work at 6am M-F and he usually doesn&#x27;t come in the small (less than 400sq ft) room until about 2am. After coming in, he usually eats, makes noise, \\&quot;studies,\\&quot; and what not. Needless to say, he deprives me of some much needed sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sleep mask is a sanity saver, I use it every night!&lt;br /&gt;Seller is great; the product came in the mail the next day.&lt;br /&gt;The mask comes with earplugs which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 star product/seller&lt;br /&gt;would buy again</li>
    <li> This is the perfect eye mask - snug, comfortable, cool to the touch, easily fastened, secure.&lt;br /&gt;As the headline says, with it &#x27;me sleep good.&#x27;</li>
    <li> My daughter needed a really good sleep mask/sound muffler to help her deal with her fear of flying as she deployed to Korea. EXCELLENT product and service! It arrived earlier than expected and I so appreciated that it got to her before she left. She loves it!  The mask is very soft and comforting.  Thank You Very Much!</li>
    <li> Mask fits great, velcro is durable, fabric is soft. Blocks light well. I wear ear plugs also, so i am not sure about the noise reduction properties, but mask holds the ear plugs in place. its a good comfortable mask that doesnt slip or irritate.</li>
    <li> the only drawback to this sleep mask is that it covers your ears.  so when you&#x27;re rustling around in your bed you&#x27;re hearing is enhanced and falling back asleep takes awhile.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews. But this product deserves attention and love. It&#x27;s comfortable, it&#x27;s wide and secure enough to stay in place all night, and it keeps out the morning (and evening) light so I can sleep. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This mask changed my sleep completely. Perfectly dark, perfectly comfortable and now I am sleeping deeply through the night. Great for travel.</li>
    <li> Most amazing mask ever! It shuts out all light and noise. I can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s on. I bought one for my fiancé.</li>
    <li> Quality design, feels great on my head, blocks out all the light around me. It&#x27;s very soft and big enough to fit my head. I often nap in my car and can&#x27;t control the amount of light that gets in, so I always keep this nearby. Love it!</li>
    <li> Very comfortable on the face and fits my large head. Stays in place while you sleep and leaves no marks.</li>
    <li> It does not block noise to any great degree, you will need something else for that.  Mine is a little frayed but seems to be holding up well.</li>
    <li> It does actually do a good job keeping light and sound out.  It is comfortable.  Cool going on but gets warm while wearing it.  The biggest problem is the fine fraying, especially around the nose piece, which make you itch.  Even with all of that, I would have given it a 4 or 5 if it wasn&#x27;t so incredibly expensive for what you get.</li>
    <li> I have an average-sized female head, and this just didn&#x27;t work for me.  I got it because I liked the feature of it covering my ears; it even comes with ear plugs!  The problem is that when I positioned it to cover my ears, it slid down the back of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even without trying to position it over my ears, I found the material too slippery to stay on well in any position. It is good quality, but the design didn&#x27;t work for me.  Returned it.</li>
    <li> This mask is really soft and keeps out every bit of light without leaving strap marks or giving you a headache. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an alternative sound reducer for sleeping or getting some quite time. I use ear plugs quite a bit but find them really uncomfortable. I&#x27;ve always been amazed there are no low profile, over ear noise reducers on the market. Believe me I&#x27;ve searched high an low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw this sleep mask with it&#x27;s claim to reduce noise I purchased it immediately. I had my doubts but for the money I didn&#x27;t really care. Well the sound reducing claim is all but false. The over ear portion of the mask is nothing special, just the same material as the rest of the mask. No additional padding or foam to help increase sound reduction. I&#x27;m sure it reduces sound to some degree but no more than say wrapping a towel around your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for blocking light, the mask is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried. The main reason for this is the mask contacts your eyelids forcing you to keep your eyes closed. It also maintains contact with the rest of your face very well. Lots of people don&#x27;t like contact with the eyes and if you&#x27;re one of them this mask is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort wise I&#x27;m pretty happy with this mask. The Velcro on the back allows it to be adjusted just right. The material is satin type and very soft. The padding is pretty thick and might get a little warm on hot nights so keep the AC on. My only comfort issue is on the bridge of the nose. There is a stitched seam there and I noticed a little abrasion on my nose. A little adjustment helps but a little extra padding here would have been nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all it&#x27;s a very good sleep mask. They should drop the sound reducing feature from the description though since it seems a stretch at best. Would have been 5 stars if this weren&#x27;t the case.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this sleep mask! It is very comfortable. I refuse to wear anything else. You won&#x27;t be sorry for trying it out!</li>
    <li> Wow!  I wish I had found this sooner,  this is the first sleep mask I&#x27;ve been able to wear comfortably over my CPAP mask. Using the mask along with the included earplugs, I&#x27;m sleeping soundly in complete darkness and total silence.  Now my wife and daughters want their own, sooooooooo I&#x27;ll be ordering more this week!</li>
    <li> Love it. It fits the way you want it to.</li>
    <li> I waited for several months before finally ordering this, but I&#x27;m sure glad I finally did. Some reviews made me wary but I&#x27;m glad I finally did it. It was the perfect solution for me after wearing out the straps on other sleep masks.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about sleep masks but when I received it as a gift I&#x27;ve become a fan. Great product and works great, especially if you are a light sleeper.</li>
    <li> Not sure what I think of this yet. I fall asleep with it on but the sun always wakes me in the morning due to it coming off of my face in the middle of the night.</li>
    <li> Expected it to be thicker, but otherwise a good product</li>
    <li> This night shade is very comfortable. It has a soft silky feel to it.  It is very good for blocking out light as I can easily sleep in a well lit room</li>
    <li> Too big...but we&#x27;ll made</li>
    <li> This mask fit me well, although it would not seal on my face. That is to say, I could always look down my nose and see the light, as it were. But that isn&#x27;t the big problem. The problem, for me anyway, is heat retention. The mask is big. Encompassing. A full wraparound. It keeps light out and it muffles sound. But to do so, it covers so much real estate without ventilation that it becomes uncomfortably warm. If you get cold easily, this mask might be for you. But it&#x27;s not for me. It works on my big face and head, which most masks do not, but I just can&#x27;t wear it.</li>
    <li> This mask is like sticking your face in a silky pair of panties!  Totally dark even in a bright bedroom ended up oversleeping 3 hours. Overslept EACH time I used the mask. For night workers this mask a great answer, it seems as if your brain is fooled into thinking it really is nighttime.</li>
    <li> Fantastic!! I didn&#x27;t think I would be able to sleep with this on but I did and got a great night sleep. I bought this because I do prison ministry and sleep in a retreat center with lots of other women who snore and make noises of one type or another all night. I am a person who can&#x27;t sleep with any noise or lights of any type. This helped me so much and would recommend to anyone who is thinking of purchasing it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a number of sleep masks over the years, and this is by far the best one.  Most masks let in some light through the underside.  If adjusted right, this mask doesn&#x27;t let in any light at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: for a more comfortable fit that won&#x27;t slip off during the night, I fasten the velcro straps at the back of my neck rather than the back of my head.</li>
    <li> This product is not very comfortible if you are a back sleeper. There a velco fastner on the back that puts presure on the back of you head because its big lump whent the two ends overlap. This product would have been a lot beter if elastic was used instead.</li>
    <li> the packaging was great. I really loved the feel, but it did not fit me. This taught me to look at the size next time I place an order for something like this. I am really upset I had to send back.</li>
    <li> I have been using my Sleep Master Sleep Mask for more than 2 years now.  It is very effective at blocking out undesired light, from both the various electronics around me, and any gaps in my window dressings.  Despite the complete coverage of the eyes, it is very comfortable, even during warm weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other masks I&#x27;ve tried have neither been as comfortable, nor as effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most important question to answer when reviewing a product may be:  Would you buy this again?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the fact that soon after I bought my first, I ordered 2 spares, and later bought one mask for a relative, and one for a friend, I would have to answer:  &amp;#34;Absolutely!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the product and the service provided by Sleep Master are top notch.</li>
    <li> Thought about this a long time before purchasing, used whatever was handy as substitute to block light (pillow, clothing, bed linens) and sleep.  My internal clock gets reset easily by light:  I wake when it&#x27;s light, not so much when it&#x27;s time to get up.&lt;br /&gt;This one was expensive, but, as described, appeared to be the most comfortable and most like what I amateurishly constructed on my own. The fabric is a washable satin, good quality. The Velcro feels solid, not cheap like some knock-off types. It comes with foam earplugs to wear underneath, if you need that; I don&#x27;t usually, but wear them occasionally when staying at a hotel or day sleeping.  All in all, does what it is designed to do, comfortably. I&#x27;m satisfied that I spent the money. [Will add an addendum if it wears out too quickly or develops some other problem.]</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is very nice.  It has held up after months of use.  It blocks out the light, it muffles noise around you without using the earplugs, which is enough for me.  It stays in place.  It&#x27;s comfortable.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend is extremely sensitive to light... we&#x27;re talking a tiny blinking light on a charger, on the opposite side of the room, will wake her. I got her this mask and she loves it! The only problem, which might be a serious one for some people in warm places... If you realllllly want a full eye mask (like this one) worn tight enough to have absolutely zero light leaks (which most others cannot provide) you&#x27;re gonna sweat a little. Sorry. Even the prettiest petite princess is going to sweat with a skin-tight slab of silk wrapped about their face. Sorry. That being said, she give zero hoots because this thing is comfy, cute, doesn&#x27;t kink her hair, and most importantly, KEEPS THE LIGHT OUT!</li>
    <li> This purchase was a gift. The product was exactly as described and, according to the individual for whom it was purchased, &amp;#34;Works beautifully.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Comfortable and cool! I also like how it slightly muffles nuisance noise yet allows you to hear an incoming phone calls or alarm.</li>
    <li> This mask comes with one pair of ear plugs only, which I intially thought that it is a special designed mask which could reduce noise very well. Yet, it still relies on the ear plugs. And simply wearing the eye mask does nothing to the noise reduction (NOT what it said in the description).</li>
    <li> I am a light sleeper and needed something to help put in deeper sleep mode.  I can honestly say this product is extremely comfortable and does the job.  I feel rested when I wake up now, having more energy!!</li>
    <li> I felt that the light of my bedroom and my desire to sleep with the TV on was effecting my sleep.  This soft mask is so nice and it doesn&#x27;t flatten my hair.  I seem to be sleeping better and may now be addicted to this mask.</li>
    <li> comfortable, hot. keeps light out.</li>
    <li> I love the deep blue color and the satiny fabric is so comfy.  It blocks out all the light and fastens with a very comfortable&lt;br /&gt;velcro tab.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Comfortable and keeps the light out.</li>
    <li> I sleep odd hours and have tried many of these. I would have given it five stars if it was truly a one size fits all and if it actually was even a little bit sound proof. It does help keep in my ear plugs though. The material is comfortable even while sleeping and maybe for someone with a larger face it would work. I have a small face (wear kid glasses).</li>
    <li> I misplaced mine and am in a panic.</li>
    <li> This product helps me sleep day or night and I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Well constructed and easy to adjust with Velcro. Sometimes slips off but not nearly as often as other eye masks. Blocks all light, is soft and cushioned, works great for those lazy weekend mornings when the sun is up before I want to be! I adjusted it for a snug but comfy fit and I just slip it off and on to get around having to readjust it each time I use it. Good product - I would buy again if I needed to replace the one I have.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like Joe Pesci&#x27;s hat from Home Alone, when the top got burned off. Why the hell is it so big?</li>
    <li> The mask feels comfortable...the material is soft and it fits well over your eyes, nose, and ears. As an added bonus, the padding on the side covers your ears and helps block out some sounds. However, the biggest downside to the sleep mask is that it retains heat and raises my body temperature at night. And no, I am not a woman on menopause :)There are times in the winter where it is cool in the house and I am very comfortable sleeping at night with no sweats; however, in the warm summer months,  I will often not use the sleep mask because it makes me sweat during the warm nights.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mask, as I work 3rd shift, and needed something to cut out the light while I sleep during the day. This mask does that perfectly. It also fits very well, being adjustable, and is very comfortable. I tend to move around a lot when I sleep, and the mask stays in place. Mine came with two ear plugs, which I have also been using, and they do a great job of muffling sounds. I have no problem sleeping with this mask on. If I needed to buy another mask, this is the one I would buy.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of the Sleep Master even after reading the reviews. I have used it a few days now and find it exactly what I was looking for. My wife likes to watch TV late at night and this drowns out the light completely. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s great for sound. For that I purchased the Hearos Xtreme Protection &amp; cut them a little shorter &amp; I sleep perfectly now. I would definitely recommend this sleep mask to anyone.  It is very comfortable and you hardly notice it&#x27;s there.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and was better than I thought.  Keeps the light out completely!  Never seen a mask like this!  I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> It looks like it might be comfortable, but this product is definitely NOT one-size-fits-all! If your hat size is 7 1/2 or larger then this will not fit, and it will not stretch.</li>
    <li> Best sleep mask I have found. If you work shift work this is the one for you.</li>
    <li> This is a warm eye mask.  It is best for cold winter nights and is almost like wearing a hat to bed.  I don&#x27;t use it in the summer.  It very lightly masks noise but only a tiny amount.</li>
    <li> Wow! This is the real deal ! Helped me sleep those nights where my roommates turn the lights on at night just to skype!</li>
    <li> i think the quality is not that good for the price~~~</li>
    <li> Comfortable and they block out all the light. They were expensive I think but I guess worth the price.</li>
    <li> The best sleep mask I have tried. Much better than the Blindfold type, this feels more like a soft blanket near your face than a blindfold</li>
    <li> I am now finally able to get a complete nights sleep.  I used to wake after the early mornings light.  After wearing the SLEEP MASTER sleep mask - I am now able to get a complete nights sleep without the interruption of light AND sound (much to my surprise). I have tried other sleeping masks and this one is the only one that is comfortable with no attention placed on the fact that you are wearing one.  This mask also helps keep ear plugs in place so they don&#x27;t fall out during sleep.  All in all, this mask was well designed.  I appreciate the effort put forth as I am now able to get a full nights sleep.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I ordered this even with the good reviews but I love when I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised! This is when I love leaving a review. This mask is so comfortable. It&#x27;s adjustable, fits comfortably around your head,fully covering your eyes and ears. I wasn&#x27;t sure what sleeping would be like with it on but when I woke up I really did feel more refreshed. Could it be that I underestimated all the stray bits of light around me even with my eyes and curtains closed? I don&#x27;t know what exactly this mask does but it works. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Comfortable and blocks out light. Stays in place with a small amount of movement through the night.&lt;br /&gt;If you need earplugs to sleep you must get the earplugs deep into your ear canal or you&#x27;ll wake up&lt;br /&gt;during the night (at least I did). I would imagine this could get a bit hot if you live in a tropical climate.</li>
    <li> I love this brand.  It is very different than what I&#x27;m used to.  It is snug, adjustable.  Fits well.  Keeps the light out.  Leaves you plenty of room for your nose while allowing you to pull the mask down far enough on your face to keep the light out.  it covers your ears; that&#x27;s something i&#x27;m not used to.  But it isn&#x27;t a problem, just something to get used to.  It does help keep noise out.  It is soft and it holds up well in the wash/dryer.  I would buy again, definitely.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- The fabric is soft.&lt;br /&gt;- The mask wraps completely around the head, which is more comfortable than a thin piece of elastic like on some masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- High price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t block light completely -- light comes in around the nose, so you must be in a dark room or keep your eyes closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Lays flat against the eyes, so you&#x27;re always aware of the mask pressing against your eyeballs.  It&#x27;s annoying at first, but you get somewhat used to it after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The mask is very noisy.  Because the fabric covers your ears, any movement AT ALL is related loudly right into your ears.  It&#x27;s like wearing headphones playing static whenever you move.  If you lay flat on your back and don&#x27;t move, it&#x27;s OK.  Note:  if you don&#x27;t mind wearing earplugs for sleeping, it might not be that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Because of the slick material, the mask slides off the back of your head very easily.  Any movement at all causes it to slide slide out of position.  If you lay flat on your back and don&#x27;t move at all, it&#x27;s OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:  I read the positive reviews and thought this would be a great product.  I was pretty disappointed and almost tossed it in the trash after 3 days of hating it.  Now I use it from time to time, and it&#x27;s OK, but not great.</li>
    <li> This sleeping mask is very nice, but lacks Eye pillows, I don&#x27;t like pressure on my eyes. I suppose most people would not mind this and give it a 5 but for me I give it a 3 thank you.</li>
    <li> As three stars say - it&#x27;s okay.  I&#x27;ve been sleeping with a mask for probably close to 15 years and this one takes many nights to get used to.  Because of it&#x27;s wraparound design it tends to make me hot - I&#x27;m a very warm blooded person who likes to sleep in a cold environment because of my tendency to overheat during the night.  This mask will probably be good during the winter months as opposed to the humid and hot summer nights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One feature I wish was better is the Velcro closing - it is just a 1/2 inch wide strip that you have to really try to get it on straight or just a portion of the long strip (which is good that the fastener is long) is attached.  Also, unless you put it on tightly it will shift around if you are a sleeper that tends to toss around like me.  This results in too much pressure on my eyes which I&#x27;m not used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another pro for this mask is the nice carrying case.  Keeps it nicely tucked away from dust and cat hair.</li>
    <li> After trying several other sleep masks this is the one that works for me. I think finding a sleep mask must be kind of like finding swimming goggles that fit. People&#x27;s faces are different shapes and I&#x27;ve had to try sleeping masks until I found what fits me. This one is solidly made, stays on through the night, allows in very little light (almost none), is comfortable and even cozy. REALLY like it and will buy a second one just to have on hand.</li>
    <li> As a shift worker this mask gives me a great 6 - 8 hrs of solid sleep. If you sleep during the day you should buy this mask.</li>
    <li> This gets extremely hot on my head, uncomfortably hot.  For the price, I feel like I got ripped off.  I think a $10-15 mask have worked out better actually.</li>
    <li> I read alllll the reviews and am EXTREMELY pleased that I gave this Sleep Mask a try.  I found it to be very comfortable - not heavy or in any way restrictive to my sleeping or breathing. :) (Nope- not bumpy, too big, too small, or any Velcro issues!  I, like Goldilocks, found an item that was \\&quot;just right\\&quot;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it with the intention of using it during migraine.  It worked very well to keep out the light of day without adding pressure to my eyes or head.  Now I am spoiled and find that nighttime isn&#x27;t as \\&quot;dark\\&quot; as I thought it was and so I use it for sleeping also!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that some other reviewer mentioned the blue fabric bleeding - I have not experienced that issue in regards to my bedding, however the color did bleed a bit the first time I washed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First rate product!</li>
    <li> My husband gifted me this mask because ever since we became parents I don&#x27;t sleep well. I imagine I hear my daughter when she&#x27;s sleeping soundly.This is our attempt to help me sleep more soundly. I&#x27;ll check back after a few weeks with more feedback.</li>
    <li> This mask sucks. It&#x27;s entirely too big and is useless. I should return it. Was extremely disappointed and glad I bought the other mask I purchased.</li>
    <li> These are the best investment towards a good night sleep and the most comfortable I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> Among the best available for the same purpose.</li>
    <li> For those of us that have trouble sleeping we&#x27;ll look to anything to help.  Removing inbound light really helped me get a better night&#x27;s rest.  This is a nice product that works as adverstised.  Be warned though, if you are normally hot blooded like me you will wake up quite warm if not sweating in the middle of the night.  I had to turn on my fan in the winter to maker sure I didn&#x27;t overheat during the night.  Other than that it is very comfortable and couple it with the included ear plugs you really dampen most outside distractions for a good sleep.  I love mine and bought one for my aunt and cousin who have trouble sleep too.  They love theirs as well.</li>
    <li> Love my sleep mask! Wide surface, silky material and easily adjustable strap. This is my new favorite!</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife and she loves it!!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this, but was pretty disappointed. It just didn&#x27;t fit well for me. I&#x27;m 6&#x27;0&amp;#34;, 185 lbs and wear a 7 3/8&amp;#34; hat. If you&#x27;re close to those dimensions or larger, I&#x27;d stay away.</li>
    <li> Provides super darkness and blocks out sound well.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to getting this sleep mask, but there are some serious design flaws that the manufacturer really should address:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) the eye sockets are not raised, so there is a pressure on your eyeballs, which after a while becomes uncomfortable, not to mention interfering with REM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) The silky material does not breathe at all, thus you wake up in the middle of the night with a hot, sticky area on your face where the mask is fitted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) The length of velcro was not able to fit the circumference of my head very well. In fact, I had to remedy that myself by actually sewing an extra length of velcro to one of the bands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, this is an overpriced, very disappointing product of low design quality. There are so many great eye masks at a lower price out there! I was expecting to receive the Mercedes of all eye gear for sleep for the $$$ I paid but instead, I received a Yugo.</li>
    <li> Comfortable, adjustable with velcro, if it came with a storage bag, I would give it another star.</li>
    <li> I bought this mask after reading the other reviews and I have to agree it is the best one out there. I suffer from dry eye and have scratched my cornea twice in my sleep prior to buying this mask. I&#x27;ve tried others but they slipped around too much and were uncomfortable for sleeping on my side. This one is very comfortable and stays in place all night. Haven&#x27;t had a scratched cornea since. It keeps my eyes closed and keeps my hair out of my eyes at night (which I assume is how it was scratched). An added bonus is it&#x27;s padded over the ears which makes it very comfortable for a side sleeper and also muffles sounds like snoring.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is amazing.  Not only is it great for sleeping, but I also suffer from migraine headaches.  The Sleep Master mask calms and soothes my headaches.  I am extremely light sensitive when I get migraines and the sleep mask blocks out all of the light which helps to ease the tension and headache.  I am thrilled to have the sleep mask and hightly recommend it not only for sleeping, but also for migraine headaches.  I am also very happy with the wonderful people I dealt with at Sleep Master. Fabulous company!</li>
    <li> The seams at the ends near the velcro are very elementary.  Also, the velcro looks really cheap.  Yes the functionality of the product is there, but at a price of $25 you should be paying for something much more quality.  The satin absorbed oils stains before it was slept in</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit too warm for my liking and does slip off my face during the night, even more than other masks I&#x27;ve worn.  But does it&#x27;s job otherwise.</li>
    <li> The fabric frays pretty quickly. After a month of use, the thing was covered in fine, loose threads which made it a bit itchy. I&#x27;ve been wearing it upside down to keep the flaps off of my nose. It also tends to slide off of me during the night.</li>
    <li> Absolute comfort. Absolute block out of light. Easy to slide on and off. I&#x27;ve already recommended to friends at work and plan to purchase another one for my teenage daughter who tried it just last night and loved it!</li>
    <li> Smells like chemicals! It would be a fast track to cancer to put this next to your nose and breathe it in all night. I tried it on and immediately took it off my face. I&#x27;m returning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s too bad is that this (can be? used to be?) a good product. I bought one of these over a year ago from Amazon and loved it. Expensive for what it was, but comfortable and good at blocking out light. Better than the other sleep masks I tried. I recently left my old one on a plane and tried to reorder the exact same thing on Amazon to replace it. Whether they&#x27;ve fundamentally changed the product, or I got one from a bad batch, I don&#x27;t know. But this one is almost certainly carcinogenic.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Very soft fabric, Fully adjustable (using Velcro strips attached onto the fabric) for large or small heads. Blocks out all light and even muffles noise because the cloth fits comfortably over your ears. I do my fair share of tossing and turning and the mask stays put without having to make it overly tight.&lt;br /&gt;Another positive point is that the fabric is very cooling. I awake during the night, overly warm, but have discovered that when I have this sleep mask on, my face seems to remain cool.&lt;br /&gt;Also, for some reason, I am able to fall right back into a deep sleep when using this mask. No more sleep deprivation! Such is the curse of the middle-aged woman.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend The Sleep Master mask. I have wasted money on other, less expensive, poorly made masks. This one is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Blocks light well but heavy.</li>
    <li> Will never purchase a different sleep mask.  Even better than the Tempur mask I have used for years and much cheaper.</li>
    <li> This is good item!&lt;br /&gt;I like it :).&lt;br /&gt;Packing is perfect.</li>
    <li> Yes, the price of the Sleep Master Sleep Mask seemed a bit steep at first.  However, I was weary of my other fraying, nose-tickling, twisted-Velcro, pillowcase-snagging, name brand masks,  all of which fell apart after just a few washings, so I decided to give the Sleep Master Sleep Mask a try.  Very glad I did!  This mask is so worth the money for the following reasons: (1) It is well-made ( in the USA at that!) of cool, comfortable, satin fabric; (2) light is completely blocked and sound is muffled (the earplugs were a nice bonus, too); (3) it comfortably fits my face and stays put around my head all night; (4) the Velcro is enclosed within the mask so there&#x27;s no strap to hurt my ears, pull hair, or snag silk pillowcases; (5) it can stay fastened and noiselessly slip over my head without the need to rip apart Velcro and wake the dead; (6) it&#x27;s easy to hand wash, air dries quickly enough, and hasn&#x27;t frayed or bunched up after a month of weekly washings; and (7) it keeps my hair in place resulting in less freakish bed head!  Therefore, the Sleep Master Sleep Mask gets my highest rating and a big woo-hoo of thanks, and I get a lot more much-needed good nights of sleep!</li>
    <li> This sleep mask fits around your head (adjustable) so it actually keeps the eyes shut! It&#x27;s great! I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who needs as much darkness as possible to get to sleep, and this mask has worked like an absolute charm. It&#x27;s soft enough to not be a nuisance, its tightness adjustability is a blessing, and most importantly, it does its job and blocks out the light. The muffling effect its strap has over the ears is a nice bonus, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to put this product to the test just days after receiving it. My family and I went up on a trip to the mountains then and the place that we usually stay at, while relatively quiet and comfy, is never truly dark. As such, I tend to sleep poorly there. But this time, I brought along the sleep mask and donned it before I went to bed that night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What followed was the best sleep I&#x27;ve gotten at that place in ages. This mask is A+. Thank you, Sleep Master!</li>
    <li> Received as a gift-- Great gift! This mask is bigger than most I&#x27;ve tried, except maybe the Tempurpedic -- But it&#x27;s very light weight and really silky and comfy, and best of all, it really works.  I&#x27;m buying another to use while this one&#x27;s in the wash!</li>
    <li> I am completely deaf when I take my aids out at night, but I&#x27;ve alwAys been extremely sensitive to light.  I&#x27;ve litterally tried everything.  The worst part is the masks fall off at night.  This one STAYS on and feels so good having it thick all the way around, but  does not affect your head iit&#x27;s not &#x27; bumpy&#x27; at all.  It&#x27;s made extremely well,  All my others have stretched so quickly to where I have to throw it away.  I know that won&#x27;t happen with this one.  The first day I got the mask I was exhausted from not sleeping, but never am able to take a nap because of the light.  I decided to just &#x27;rest&#x27; with it on and I slept for 3 hours!!! First  time ever!  The best mask I&#x27;ve ever bought!! I will recommend this over and over.</li>
    <li> I have had others but the band stretches out and eventually they wear out.&lt;br /&gt;This one is built to last and it even wraps around my ears to lessen the ambient noise.&lt;br /&gt;I use it every night since I got it from here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;As a former overnight shift worker I researched the importance of sleeping in total darkness. I started using a night mask right away and still do to this day.&lt;br /&gt;I always get a great night of sleep or even naps when I have something covering my eyes. I dont have any light getting to my eyes and I sleep like a baby. I recommend getting the &amp;#34;Sleep Master&amp;#34; for a perfect nap or nights sleep.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT SELLER, EXCELLENT MASK, I HAVE ORDER SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF SLEEPING MASKS AND THIS ONE IS BY-FAR THE BEST ONE YET.  SELLER WAS FAST ON SHIPPING, ITEM WAS BETTER THAN DESCRIBED,  WILL BUY FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN AND AGAIN - THANK YOU - Connie Sue in Texas</li>
    <li> I bought a couple different eye masks and tried it out along w/my fiancee. We both agreed that the \\&quot;Dream Essentials\\&quot; was way better than the \\&quot;Sleep Master\\&quot; for a few reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) Effectiveness - the Dream Essentials seemed like it fit both of our heads way better. I have a large head, she has a small head. The Sleep Master is basically just a padded soft blue thing to wrap around your head with a really small nose slit cut out of it. You could make one yourself at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) Eye pockets are cut out in the Dream Essentials. My fiancee doesn&#x27;t have to worry about her lashes. For me, it just feels better.. it feels like you are in a dark room vs. having something covering your eyes.. you can open your eyes and look around&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) Price. The especially disappointing thing about the \\&quot;Sleep Master\\&quot; is that it is DEFINITELY not worth whatever they charged us (I think it was $20). The Dream Essentials was less than $10 and got the job done</li>
    <li> This is maybe a 5 dollar mask at best I feel totally ripped off. Not even close to be worth 10$ I want my money back or 4 more. I don&#x27;t think this product will not last it feels like it has cotton or something inside not even some revolutionary material. Such bs. It comes with ear plugs which aren&#x27;t comfortable I bought 50 ear plugs for 5 dollars.... yet only one pair with this mask. The mask alone doesn&#x27;t stop sound what a joke.... BS DON&#x27;T buy buy Brookstone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update now that I&#x27;ve used the product a little while the padding has turned to mush rendering this unusable and uncomfortable. It seeps LIGHT IN  like crazy right into the eyes under the nose area. 25 dollars YEA RIGHT. RIP OFF 3 dollars maybe.r</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is luxurious and well-padded. It feels very comfortable and induces sleep quite naturally.  This mask is far superior to less expensive ones.</li>
    <li> I bought this mask after trying several others and found that this one blocks more light and the material is more soothing against the eyes.  The velcro attachment in the back makes it quick and easy to put on and remove. The only thing that would make this mask better would be to make the eye sockets elevated so that the mask does not touch the eye ball themselves and therefore does not cause any unnecessary pressure.</li>
    <li> This sleeping mask is my first. I started working third shift, so I needed something to block the light out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s comfortable, light weight, and muffles sound a bit. I avoided other sleeping masks with the strap because I&#x27;ve heard they hurt your ears. This sleeping mask does not hurt any part of my face or ears, I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re having sleeping problems due to light or lack of blinds, trust me, this will aid you.</li>
    <li> This has been one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in a while!  I work weird shifts and sometimes have to sleep during the day, there for a while it was a pain.  I would have to cover my eyes with a pillow to \\&quot;try\\&quot; to get some sleep.  Since buying this mask I can sleep comfortably at all times of the day!</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is absolutely amazing.  The size and shape are perfect, and the fabric feels wonderful and breathes beautifully. Not a peep of light creeps through, and the velcro closure keeps it just as snug as you like it, and doesn&#x27;t pull hair.  The 500+ extremely positive reviews convinced me to try it, and I&#x27;m so glad they did.  Take the plunge, you will never regret it.</li>
    <li> This mask is nicely made, VERY comfortable and it does a great job of blocking out light.  It washes well too, which is a big plus.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Very Good and soft , very comfortable . I recommending this product for everyone .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;best wishes and good luck</li>
    <li> I started wearing a mask when some neighbors moved in and they keep their outside light on all night long and it is about 5 feet away from my window.  Light creeps in and makes it difficult for me to sleep.  I was using a mask from a little Delta Airlines sleep kit that someone gave me.  This worked okay but the band around the back was annoying and went across part of my cheekbone. I am a back sleeper. I can fall asleep in one position on my back and stay there the whole night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I saw this and thought it might work out.  I&#x27;ve worn it for 5 nights now I believe. Takes some getting used to and when I move my head (I have a fairly hard memory foam pillow so softer pillows might work fine) the part which goes around my ears opens so any sound is no longer muffled.  If I lay on my side (which I do not like to do it closes up fine but I always wind up going back to my original position (back).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like that to adjust it the velcro is really loud and my husband gets disturbed but once you have it adjusted to suit your head, you should not have to adjust it too much.  I also don&#x27;t see any other way it could be done, apart from getting a custom-made mask. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is soft and comfortable (I like that there are no elastic bands that touch my face and it does block the light quite effectively) and I am going to continue to use it and and see if it will work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;October 23, 2012:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it; I tightened it a little (the velcro sound scared the daylights out of my cat who was sleeping on my bed; she jumped - poor kitty - lol!) a week or so ago and kind of crossed the back a little (meaning it is not straight across the velcro in the back but kind of on an angle) so that it is tighter around my ears (but not too tight) and it no longer opens when I turn my head! And it still comfortable, the askew velcro&#x27;ing makes no difference in how it feels, even when I sleep with my head straight up on the pillow (back sleeper).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not mind that in the morning when my alarm wakes me, it is sometimes still on my head and sometimes it is not; because I am not woken by light in the morning but by my alarm.  However, there should be an invention which stops it from falling behind the bed! :-) I was missing it for one night; thought my cat might have dragged it off somewhere (because she is a collector or could be getting me back for scaring the daylights out of her with the velcro sound - lol) but it had just fallen behind head of the bed (we do not have a solid headboard) and I was searching for it, all worried I had lost it for good.  Luckily, I located it last night before bedtime and was very happy. Now I know where to look for it when it \\&quot;disappears\\&quot;. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I think this is a great product and worth the money for those that want to get good rest.  I could put this on in a completely lit room and have the sound muffled and light completely shut out.  Maybe I&#x27;ll even try it on road trips (which I can NEVER sleep on).</li>
    <li> This mask works great to cover light 100%.  At the beginning, a tiny but annoying ray of light came through a small opening along my nose. After using it a few times, the mask started to fit perfectly, so it&#x27;s really great now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Not significant noise reducing&lt;br /&gt;- It does slide a few times from the back of my head. So it loosens and light comes through.&lt;br /&gt;- In general the mask works great but I believe it&#x27;s a little expensive for what it is&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great mask anyway!</li>
    <li> The product is just as described. It keeps the light out of my eyes and wraps gently around my head. It is very comfy to wear and easy to put on. An easy Velcro strap allows for adjustment. I was also surprised to get it so quickly. After I ordered the Sleep Master Mask it arrived in three days and came with free ear plugs which was an extra bonus. In the last few nights since purchasing this product I have enjoyed good full deep sleep and awoken refreshed and ready to take on the world. I am pleased with is mask and would gladly buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> I have owned four other sleep masks, but none was as comfortable and worked as well as the Sleep Master. I have a sleeping disorder that often leaves me awake at night and trying to fill in the hours I missed during the day. The other masks I&#x27;ve owned did not hold up well. The elastic band in back would stretch out and the eye pieces did not shield out all the light nearly as good as this mask does. A plus is that the design of the Sleep Master helps reduce noise and soft ear plugs are also included. This is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this sleep mask because when traveling especially, I have trouble sleeping due to outside light and unfamiliar noises being distractions. This mask was the best I&#x27;ve found thus far(and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few kinds over the years). Its comfortable whether sleeping on my side or back and blocks out light well and even muffles some intrusive sounds (which could just be mind over matter but since it covers the ears it seems to help). And I appreciate the way it is made to allow the nose comfortable room while also framing the eyes closely to block out the light. It arrived on time, is a decent price for the quality and I like it very much so I&#x27;m happy on all counts.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a hospital stay, and am now using it on vacation.  It works good for me, the earplugs are a little better than the ones I use every night.  It is too warm for me if the bedroom isn&#x27;t fairly cool.</li>
    <li> luv it!  it is very comfortable and does a great job at keep the light out and the wide sides keeps the ear plugs in place! would totally buy again!!!</li>
    <li> not super comfortable.  have to make it a little too tight to keep light out.  moves around on you when you roll over, etc.</li>
    <li> So soft highly recommend</li>
    <li> This mask has exceeded my expectations for comfort and performance.  It covers my ears to reduce ambient sound as well as eliminating the sunlight of the daytime hours when I need to nap.  It is soft and practical in its&#x27; application.  Well done!</li>
    <li> I love it!!  Has proven to be exactly what the description is.  Silences the noices around you and definately does not let any light in.  I washed it in the washer but let it air dry.  It is about 24 inches long.</li>
    <li> This is junk.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  It does not muffle sound without the earplugs which is specifically why I bought it.  It is also hard to keep in place and slips down off the back of my head.  Maybe my head isn&#x27;t square enough.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Though the only recommendations I&#x27;d make for the manufacturer is to use fleece for a snuggly feel (the satin is too icy cool in winter) and to use a much denser loft inside.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a cheaper sleep mask.  This one is definitely worth the extra money.  It&#x27;s very comfortable and blocks almost 100% of the light.  It does a much better job block light around my nose than my old mask.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Love it.  Need to order a new one and will be ordering the same thing again.  It is like 2 fluffy pillows on your eyes.  Keeps light out and helps me get a good night sleep.  I am absolutely insane without good rest and this mask has been wonderful.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> It feels great but the nose contour allowance is meant for a specific type of taller nose. I tend to bring it lower to block all the light peering through the lower edge of the fabric. My face becomes dry when I take it off in the morning. I plan on using this on future business trips.</li>
    <li> Gets a little hot around your head if you leave it on for a long time.But it fits the purpose</li>
    <li> Arrived as scheduled and is all that is advertised!  A wonderful purchase and worth the money.  I don&#x27;t know what else there is to say to fill those four more words?  I hope this will do.</li>
    <li> This product was shipped well. I received fairly quickly. I still use it today. Like that it wraps my eyes and ears. Helps to sleep better. I would not mind buying similar or another product.</li>
    <li> Wearing this thing is like having an angel gently close your eyes and keep its hand there.  It also keeps sound out and never pinches, squeezes, or does anything to be even remotely uncomfortable.  Let&#x27;s just say that getting into bed after my wife has fallen asleep is usually a good way to wake her up and make her go ape crazy, I haven&#x27;t had that problem once since she&#x27;s started wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We went through 3 different kinds, now we have a brand that we&#x27;ll NEVER turn away from.  All I can pray is that it stays affordable so that if my dog decides it would be fun to rip apart, I can get another one.</li>
    <li> Mask works great, included ear plugs do almost nothing (i.e. when my wife is watching t.v. I can clearly hear the dialogue).</li>
    <li> I have purchased 2 of these sleep masks.  The first I wore out after several years of nightly use, but now I depend on it especially to get me through the spring and summer early sunrises, so I bought a replacement.  It is soft and flexible, easily adjustable to fit nearly any head size, an effective black-out device, and even helps dampen noise.</li>
    <li> I would agree with a previous review on this one--if you use a moisturizer it will get this dirty fast.  It is very comfortable and blocks out light very well.  Probably not worth the money though.</li>
    <li> I needed the mask to keep my eyes closed and keep them from drying out at night.  works wonders for me.  love it and have bought a second.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good sleep mask but not worth the price. The only upside to the large size is the mask will stand out and be hard to loose.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these things! What a waste of money, please just but the cheaper version, it would do the same thing and won&#x27;t fall off your face during the night. For $25 I was expecting more quality, this product is over priced.</li>
    <li> This mask has been very necessary as I have had to sleep on the couch due to back pain, but my husband stays up later than I do watching TV or playing computer games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* No latex, hypoallergenic and Hand washable&lt;br /&gt;  As long as I&#x27;ve washed (I used Woolite in a small bucket) and hung it it right after I&#x27;m up for the day, it&#x27;s dry and ready to use&lt;br /&gt;  that night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Amazingly light-weight, soft, cool satin fabric, that is comfortable and breathable&lt;br /&gt;  It is very light-weight and the fabric is very soft and comfortable to wear.  I love the feel of it on my skin :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It is flexible, durable, wide, surrounds your head and is easily connected in the back by Velcro strips&lt;br /&gt;  The coverage is amazing and the adjust-ability of the Velcro makes it perfect for anyone.  It gives me coverage everywhere I&lt;br /&gt;  need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Made in USA&lt;br /&gt;  I always love this :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Synthetic shell/ cotton interior&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional thoughts...&lt;br /&gt;  I have used the ear plugs that come with this and while the sound is controlled, it&#x27;s not very comfortable to sleep with laying on&lt;br /&gt;  your side.  I have replaced these with silicone plugs and have had no problem at all laying in any position :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The one nuisance, though easily adjusted, is the bridge of the nose on the mask, where there is no cushion at that specific&lt;br /&gt;  point in the stitching.  It can sometimes slightly dig into my skin, but moving it up slightly remedies the problem.  Not a biggie,&lt;br /&gt;  but something I&#x27;ve noticed :)</li>
    <li> I bought this about two weeks ago and have been sleeping great ever since.  I actually pair it up with a pair of sleeping headphones for a night of truly peaceful sleep.  The satin is cooler than other fabrics and the mask does and excellent job blocking light.  Easily the best sleeping mask I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> I have tried about 15 different sleep masks over the past 6 years when I found I was getting poor sleep due to different sources of light in my bedroom. I found some better than others and tried all the ones with the highest ratings. Brookstone eye masks were the best ones I could find; that is until I tried The Sleep Master sleep mask. It is almost perfect. The material is soft and envelopes your eyes and head in a cloud like feeling. I feel instantly relaxed and sleepy when I put it on. It is lightweight and does not feel hot. The only thing that may bother some people is that it lays directly on your eyes.... I found if I loosen the mask a little, it does not compress the eyes. I just love this mask. Sweet Dreams!</li>
    <li> I bought this sleep mask based on the reviews and was very excited to try it because I work graveyard and must sleep during the day. When I finally did wear it to sleep, I found that the material made my head feel hot (This was in the winter!) and damp. The eye mask still lets some light in and overall the thickness of it made it uncomfortable to sleep on my back which I normally do. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I wish I could return it but it&#x27;s been too long since I ordered it and now it&#x27;s probably too late. Oh well. Lesson learned. My cheap novelty hello kitty eye mask works a hell of a lot better and is much more comfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item for an xmas gift for my wife...along with several others, this one was by far her favorite, so having wasted money on many others thought it would be wise to let people know they can save money by knowing which is best</li>
    <li> I really love this sleep mask. I have several as I work the night shift but this is by far my favorite. Ver soft, comfy, doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;grap&amp;#34; your ears and excellent at light blocking. I have now purchased 2 for fellow night shift workers and they are happy campers!</li>
    <li> Just okay.  The product was not worth the price.  The back of the mask is bulky and not as comfortable as expected.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I LOVE IT!!! Even better than I expected. I was a little hesitant to pay $25 for an eye mask, but I&#x27;m glad I did. \\&quot;</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would be able to sleep with a mask on, but I needed to block out the light from the street and sometimes from my husband&#x27;s reading light.  The sleep mask worked great, and was so comfortable that I quickly adjusted to wearing it while sleeping .  I love it!  Also, the delivery was very quick.</li>
    <li> This is the best sleep mask I have found so far and I have tried several.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is well made (nice materials, no Chinese stuff), blocks light and it is the only one I found that can be worn comfortably by side sleepers, without any risk of displacing the mask during sleep. The only thing I dont like is the silky texture, but It is well made and will please whoever likes silk (I dont). Still a 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sounds silly but there are no instructions and I thought it wasn&#x27;t needed, but after reading a tip from another customer here I found that the proper way to use it is not over the ears like other masks, but actually as loose as possible and almost under the ears (with strap ends towards the back of the neck). After following this tip I cant even feel the mask and I never lost it.</li>
    <li> Thick, well padded, and covered in a satin like fabric, this covers your eyes and head pretty well. Little to no light leaks. It is a bit tight on my large head, but does fit properly. However, since it closes with hook-n-loop (Velcro) it can catch your hair, if it&#x27;s long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought my wife all kinds of things for Birthdays, Christmas, Valentine&#x27;s Day, Arbor Day - some really good gifts.  GOOD gifts, but the Sleep Master Mask was GREAT!  The silk material is light enough so that it doesn&#x27;t become uncomfortable or hot, so she can get to sleep fast, and stay asleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, here&#x27;s a little secret:&lt;br /&gt;I watch TV at night, and the light for the 22\\&quot; LCD created a glow that was keeping my wife awake.  After I got her the Sleep Master Sleep Mask, she was never kept awake by the glow created by the TV.  I was having a hard time seeing the tiny 22\\&quot; screen - so, I upgraded!  Now, I&#x27;m watching TV on a 40\\&quot; TV while my wife is sleeping comfortably with her Sleep Master Sleep Mask!  It doesn&#x27;t get any better than that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She sleeps better, so she&#x27;s more rested, I got my new huge TV for the bedroom, she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy, SHE&#x27;S happy with ME - life is good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it for her, she&#x27;ll thank you!  :)</li>
    <li> This is the best sleep mask I have ever used.  I work 7p to 7a and sleeping during the day isn&#x27;t always easy, but with the Sleep Master I have been able to sleep mostly uninterrupted.  The material is very comfortable on my face, and with the included earplugs, I am out like a light.  I wish I had bought one of these years ago.  If you have trouble sleeping, buy this product.</li>
    <li> I love this it works great &amp; keeps all light out when you sleep plus it&#x27;s very comfortable to wear!</li>
    <li> Reading the other reviews here is like a trip with Alice through the looking glass.  Either they haven&#x27;t tried all the options out there, or they are working for the manufacturer, perhaps stockholders, as their reviews are either entirely fictional, or they are naive to the ways of sleep masks, or perhaps they are all masochists who hate sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought and used every sleep mask on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the most expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also by far the least comfortable, least effective, most annoying piece of trash in the bunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It bunches at the nose, as you can see in the photo above, pinching the bridge of the nose painfully and pressing hard against the eyeballs which is harmful to your eyes and stifles REM sleep without which deep sleep is impossible.  You can see the truth of this in the photo above.  See how the model is grimacing from the pain of her eyeballs and nose being pinched and pressed hard?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have never stayed on all night, always falling off before the critical early morning hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shape and size are not sufficient for an adult sized male head, barely fitting only when I pull it far too tight, the velcro closure catches and traps hair causing painful hair pulling in the night, and while the closure traps hair perfectly, it does not stick to itself worth a darn, about equal stickiness to a twice pre-used piece of masking tape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am returning this overpriced garbage and buying a new set of two contoured masks for 9 dollars!  They may not last forever, but they actually work, they are very comfortable, they stay on all night, and most importantly they do not interfere with essential REM sleep!</li>
    <li> I love this mask in all ways, except for the lumpy back closure.  It fastens with a vertical strip of velcro which is very uncomfortable against the skull when you sleep on your back.  On my side, it is a dream.  So comfortable and comforting.  But I need to sleep on my back a lot of the time and it just doesn&#x27;t work for that.  So disappointing.</li>
    <li> This is the second sleep mask I&#x27;ve owned. The first one was something I purchased in a travel store a decade ago and left on a plane several years ago. I liked that one, but this is substantially better. There&#x27;s less pressure on your eyes, more light is blocked out, there&#x27;s no elastic to stretch out and the pillow feels cooling to your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+.</li>
    <li> perfect for adult play... but slides off if you move around too much.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money. All it is is a fancy eye mask and disposable ear plugs. Revolutionary, my a@@.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask fits directly on eyelids.  I prefer the ones which a little space between eyelid and mask.  The ones you termed &amp;#34;bikini for the eyes&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I bought this for work so I could put on the mask after lunch for a quick power nap. It&#x27;s really comfortable and blocks out the light and I can zone out for 15-20 minutes and really feel refreshed. This is better than the Brookstone or other sleep masks. If you want a comfortable rest, get this. I look forward to trying this on a plane and in bed as well.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these masks about 2 months ago and so far it has worked pretty well. I have had a difficult time sleeping lately. In particular, I have had noticed increased sensitivity to light and sound when I am trying to sleep. This mask took out the light completely and reduced the sound to a level that is barely audible. The fit of the mask on my face and around my head is good. I would recommend this mask to anyone who is looking for an alternative to the combination of ear plugs and a traditional sleep mask that only covers your eyes.</li>
    <li> Soft, smooth &amp; fully light blocking. Comes down over the ears a bit to provide some sound blocking &amp; even came with a pair of foam ear plugs.&lt;br /&gt;As a night shift nurse I have become so accustomed to a mask that I need it even sleeping at night to block out electronics lights or the light of the moon.&lt;br /&gt;Velcro adjustable and washes nicely.  So far best mask I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> soft, comfortable, perfectly adjustable. Works excellent. I don&#x27;t know how it could be improved</li>
    <li> Item was as described.  Wife didn&#x27;t like it because it covers your ears. My only problem was when I returned it there was something called  &amp;#34;Return Shipping Fee Refund Deduction&amp;#34; which amounted to about 25%.  What happened to the great Amazon return policy?</li>
    <li> This seller truly cares about customers and makes sure they are satisfied with the purchased product. The mask is very soft and very comfortable to wear while sleeping. Also, it was shipped fast (faster than expected). I have not had any problems with the mask at all. It is worth it. I had a pleasant shopping experience. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Sleep Master(tm) has created a product which not only is functional, but is amazingly comfortable. Most sleep masks have a blind-folded feeling, making you feel like you&#x27;re about to be a victim on Law &amp; Order: SVU. Not with Sleep Master(tm).  The fabric breathes, the Velcro is a simple answer to the problems caused by an elastic band or tie, and it completely blocks out any bothersome lighting. So, if you&#x27;re tired of sleeping with a forearm on your face and desire to breathe and sleep in a way that a pillow really can&#x27;t provide, order this product. It ships lightning fast and you&#x27;ll be sleeping like you&#x27;ve been wanting to in no time.</li>
    <li> Before using the Sleep Master mask, I had only used those free sleep masks they give you on airplanes, which always managed to wiggle off my head during sleep, while also leaving rubber band marks around my ears.  This sleep mask offers a completely different concept - pitch darkness no matter the conditions, without compromising comfort.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who sleeps in bright rooms, or for those who struggle with insomnia.</li>
    <li> I like it fine. It&#x27;s pretty comfortable except, I like to fall asleep on my back, and the Velcro closure is a bit bulky on the back of my head. I still am glad I have it.</li>
    <li> I have been using eye masks for years now and I saw this and decided to try it out to see if it blocked out more light. It&#x27;s really large and covers most of my head, but the velcro is generous and you can adjust it easily to fit your head. I also put it in the washing machine when it got smelly and it came out great, no problems. It isn&#x27;t migrate-proof though its better than those cheapie eye masks you get from the store. Blocks out light very well and I like the satin finish. It doesn&#x27;t leave marks on my face (although my cotton pillowcase does). It seems really durable and long lasting.</li>
    <li> They do not work, at all.</li>
    <li> What a really great sleep mask. So comfortable and soft-- exceeded all expectations. I would recommend this highly. It also makes for a great gift.</li>
    <li> She needed something to block out all the lights.  This worked like a charm, helped with earplugs to get a good nights rest.</li>
    <li> Very soft and fits snug without feeling closterphobic. Will enjoy using this. Tried it when I first received it sitting in my chair. Didn&#x27;t take long and I was fast asleep.</li>
    <li> Blocks out all light. Perfect for home, airplanes, travel and any time really. It is also made from a very comfortable material.</li>
    <li> I have damage to a blinking muscle that causes my eye to open up once I enter deep sleep. I have been to so many doctors and they tell me to tape my eye shut. Try taping your eye shut and peel off the tape in the morning.  Even with the most gentle tape it&#x27;s a nightmare. I&#x27;ve been told to use Saran wrap, which will leave weird wrinkles around my eyes the next day. I&#x27;ve been told to use a dry eye &#x27;goggles&#x27; (they look like motorcycle goggles) but they leave deep marks in my lower eyelid the next day. I&#x27;ve tried so many different masks, so far this is the best one. The only complaint is if I put in on tight it will cause me eye pain, but if too loose it will drift upwards during the night. But with the long flaps it usually manages to cover my eye enough to do the job.  I dinged star for the inability to get a stable snug fit.  I wish I could design one, I know exactly how to make it perfect. Two connections in the back instead of one, with one over the ear and one under the ear.  I just gave myself the ides to alter one of them (I bought four) and see if it  works better!  I combine this mask with one of the preservative free eye gels. FWIW I referred this to a friend who just has sleeping problems, not a medical problem like I have,  and she finds it covers too much of her face and it makes her hot. I don&#x27;t have that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone out there has a better solution I&#x27;d love to hear from you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  I figured out how to make this mask PERFECT. I cut it into 2 tabs in the back and then sew on Velcro to each strap. this way one strap is over the ear, the other under. It is the absolute PERFECT mask that doesn&#x27;t leave marks on my face and doesn&#x27;t budge all night. Even without the tweaks it&#x27;s the best sleep mask out there.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. My husband watches TV at night and I can&#x27;t sleep because of the light that it gives off. This works perfectly and I love the velcro...it keeps it securely in place and is very comfortable to wear!!!</li>
    <li> blocks out all light, is very comfortable to wear, and easy to wash and keep clean. I have had issues with some masks that will stain my white satin pillow cases, these do not. very well made. they do muffle sound a bit, but obviously the main purpose is to block out light, and it does an excellent job. it stays in place, does not pull on your hair, or hold heat while you sleep, nor do you wake up with a so called &amp;#34;mask face&amp;#34; from having it on, - you know the little lines you get when you have something pressed on your face for an extended period of time. it does lightly touch your eyes, but does not put any real pressure on them. over all wonderful mask, well worth the extra money, as it will likely be the last make you order for a very long time. I know for me, it will be my last, until I need to replace it, which I think will be a while from now, and when I do, I will order this mask again.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this! It sureis soft and she talks about how comfortable it is all the time!!!</li>
    <li> Fits great, and it&#x27;s super comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I have white sheets. I noticed my white pillowcase, after a few days of using this mask, had a very noticeable blue stain. Whatever dye they used in the mask easily transfers to your sheets. So heads up.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband who sleeps during the day because he works nights. His quality of sleep has improved. We tested the mask by turning a light on when he was wearing it and he couldn&#x27;t tell that it was on. We have a 2 year old who isn&#x27;t very good at remembering to be quiet when Daddy is sleeping, but the sound muffling in the mask helps. Though he still wears basic earplugs as well.</li>
    <li> WILL DO BUSINESS WITH AGAIN</li>
    <li> As others reviewed, this sleep mask isn&#x27;t perfect (what is?), but it is very good: Pretty comfortable, doesn&#x27;t move around excessively, seems well made and does block the light well.  Only true negative is that it is indeed quite warm unless the bedroom in fairly cool.  To make it closer to perfect, I would add some \\&quot;friction\\&quot; pads to grip your hair at the back of your head and cut its weight (thickness) in half to make it cooler.</li>
    <li> I bought this for long international air flights where I wanted to sleep on the plane, the combination of this mask and some decent ear plugs really can put you in another world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask is super soft and wide, velvety plush feel, the velcro fastening system is great for fine tuning  the comfort, the fact that the mask covers your ears is a plus to me. I have used 3 different other eye masks and this is the best for flights and hotels, love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d watched this mask on amazon for years, but could never hit the buy button.  It was just a little too much to spend on a potential mistake. But on a recent trip I stayed in a hotel room with curtains too small for windows and was greeted by morning sun glaring through the edge of my old mask. So, I decided I&#x27;d chance buying this pricey Sleep Master. The sunny hotel room was the actual expensive mistake! The Sleep Master, it turns out, was one of the smartest buys I&#x27;ve made.  This thing blocks out all the light no matter what position I wake up in and it is REALLY comfortable. If morning sun is an issue for you, I suggest you click the buy button.</li>
    <li> I RECEIVED THIS MASK QUICKLY.  I LOVE IT.  I DIDN&#x27;T KNOW A SLEEP MASK COULD EXTEND MY SLEEP TIME.  THIS ONE LET ME SLEEP FOR 8 HOURS IN PLACE OF THE 3 OR 4 I USUALLY HAVE SLEPT IN THE LAST 30 YEARS. IT IS SO COMFORTABLE THAT I DID NOT EVEN KNOW IT WAS ON.  I WOULD HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE.  I COULD NOT BE MORE PLEASED.</li>
    <li> It is too big for me, almost cover my whole face.....</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my fiance who finds wearing a sleep mask a necessity every night. He said that it&#x27;s extremely comfortable and well-ventilated. Most importantly, it blocks out light completely. The mask is wide all the way around so that it covers your ears as well. So if you want to use ear plugs, the mask will hold them in place. The velcro in the back makes adjusting it very easy and can accommodate any adult&#x27;s head size.</li>
    <li> These eye shades are THE BEST I have ever worn. I&#x27;ve been using them since the Christmas Holidays and can attest to terrific comfort, ease of adjustment and softness around my eyes. This sleep mask fits firmly enough to block light while offering sufficient flex for rapid eye movement beneath the material. I would (will) definitely get another one.</li>
    <li> This mask does actually block out most light. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it that I feel like I am suffocating when I am using it. I&#x27;m not really suffocating. It is mostly a psychological fear that I have. But it does what it claims to do. Sometimes the masks rises up or moves down depending on how much you toss and turn and move around at night.</li>
    <li> I get such a better sleep with an eye mask. This not only has better coverage but also covers your ears.  Brings on the darkness and quiet. 🙈🙉</li>
    <li> This used to be my favorite sleep mask, after trying three other highly-rated sleep masks here on Amazon. It blocked the most light, while also being comfortable to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after wearing it for three years, I noticed a flaw: the &#x27;ear flaps&#x27; (the wide bit of cloth that wraps around your ears to velcro the mask together behind your head) can cause ear pain if it&#x27;s on too tight; yet the mask needs to be really night to block out all the light. I have big ears, and sleep with earplugs, which exacerbated the problem, but there would be many mornings, and sometimes whole weeks, where my ears would be sore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earlier this year, I lost my Sleep Master mask, and bought a new one, along with a [[ASIN:B007ZFN1FY Bucky Luggage 40 Blinks Ultralight Sleep Mask]] and a [[ASIN:B000FFSWAU Bucky Shades Sleep Mask With Earplugs]]. I found that the Sleep Master had improved since I bought my original three years ago, removing a stiff cardboard insert in the ear flaps, making it more comfortable to wear at night. However, I found both Bucky sleep masks blocked more light, and the Bucky Shades sleep mask was just as comfortable as the Sleep Master, while the 40 Blinks was even more comfortable than either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this isn&#x27;t a bad sleep mask by any means -- I used it for three years, and happily bought a new one when it went missing. However, I can no longer say it&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> This mask is remarkably comfortable.  It&#x27;s large and pretty-much blocks out all light.  It covers your ears, so sound is muffled.  It comes with a pair of earplugs, the disposable type which are easily-replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice some other reviewers are concerned about how the mask comes up against your eyelids.  If you&#x27;ve got the mask on snug, you can&#x27;t open your eyes.  It helps with keeping things dark.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s bad not to be able to open your eyes.  I haven&#x27;t had any problem in three weeks of use, other than the worry when I realize I can&#x27;t open my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fabric is especially comfortable, and there is no feeling of being constricted by straps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, this product is a treat.</li>
    <li> I work nights, so it&#x27;s important for me to have a quality sleep mask to assist in my sleeping. I love how it wraps around your head and is super soft, not bulky and uncomfortable like traditional sleep masks. It does a great job of keep the light out of the sides, giving me total darkness for restful sleep. I love this product!!!</li>
    <li> I have migraine headaches from lack of good solid sleep. This does help me. I would recomend trying this if you have the same problem.</li>
    <li> To be honest, this is the worst product I have ever purchased at Amazon. The review seem nice and all but this product is nothing special and most importantly, IT DOES NOT WORK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder what patent this product has...It&#x27;s just a piece of silk eye mask. It does not reduce a single bit of noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best rest? Nope, it felt like I wasn&#x27;t wearing anything at all (noise wise)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: If you read the product description, they misspelled \\&quot;guaranteed\\&quot; wrong...and for obvious reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 2: The patent only claim is (word for word): \\&quot;The ornamental design for an sound muffling sleep mask, as shown.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> When I got this in the mail it came with ear plugs and that made me excited.  I work night shift and this mask helps me get the sleep I need during the day without noise or light interruptions.  I was dreading putting up &amp;#34;black out&amp;#34; curtains in my bedroom and now I don&#x27;t have to.  This is a very comfortable sleeping mask.  It&#x27;s given a great day&#x27;s sleep ever since I bought it.</li>
    <li> I read some of the other reviews and thought I&#x27;d give this mask a try - I&#x27;m glad I did. This is the best mask I&#x27;ve used. I have sleep apnea and use a CPAP. To make it worse, I travel and I&#x27;m often in different time zones trying adjust my internal clock. I&#x27;ve tried other masks, but I have to say this is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It is a bit different in that it is more of a wrap around mask and pulled lower it covers my ears (reducing noise) and the velcro fastening sits comfortably at the base of my skull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is well constructed - the part that sits over your eyes conforms well to eliminate light. The sides are stiffer, but this (I assume) is by design to help the mask block out noise. It is very soft and comfortable - I hardly know I&#x27;m wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this mask. I really value my sleep and this mask does a great job of making it easier to fall asleep, stay asleep and wake rested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quick note to respond to some of the negative reviews:&lt;br /&gt;- &amp;#34;Bulky in the back&amp;#34; (back sleepers, which I am one):  pull it a little lower in the back, it will cover your ears and you won&#x27;t have the fastening sitting directly on the back of your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Velcro rubs on the pillow: Undo the velcro, and turn it inside out so the loop part of the velcro is outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI - my standards for a 5 star rating:&lt;br /&gt;5 Star Requirements&lt;br /&gt;- Price point must be reasonable (I&#x27;d expect a $100 sleep mask to be great)&lt;br /&gt;- Must hold up to daily use with no (or very few) issues&lt;br /&gt;- Must be easy to use, or set up (e.g., I don&#x27;t have to sing while standing on one leg to get it to work)&lt;br /&gt;- Must perform as advertised (none of this &amp;#34;your experience may vary&amp;#34; crap)&lt;br /&gt;- Must have a bonus feature I find valuable</li>
    <li> I was excited to find something with a good black out but this was hard to sleep in and I woke up with sore ears. It serves it&#x27;s purpose if you want to block sound and light but it&#x27;s too much on my ears to sleep in comfortably.</li>
    <li> This mask worked so well, it blocked out all the light and even helped with Sound.  It is very comfortable and I would recommend to any one of my family/friends.  Love it and love the wonderful sleep I now get! xo</li>
    <li> Rave, Rave, Rave! This is the best sleep mask I&#x27;ve ever had (an I&#x27;ve had a few). Very comfortable, really blocks light, and no elastic band to stretch out. Helps me still get to sleep, even around odd work hours. I use it when I have a headache; relieves light sensitivity and helps me relax. I also use it for travel. It does NOT block out my husbands snoring, but i appreciate the full coverage marketing</li>
    <li> Of several models that I tried, this was not the best. It is very comfortable fabric and fluffy, helping to relax the problem is that you realize a little light into the part of the nose, and slip a lot.</li>
    <li> When I first got this product I really didn&#x27;t care much for it. I thought it was too flat and I didn&#x27;t like the cut out for the nose. I preferred the regular elastic strap, more padding mask. Then I got one of my migraines. The other mask just felt annoying on my face. So, I decided to try the Sleep Master out again. I really liked how you could adjust the pressure of the mask from the Velcro in the back. I like a lot of pressure because most of my migraines are behind my eye and this mask came through. I also really liked how soft, smooth, and non-bulky this mask was. It was very comfortable to lay in any position and the mask stayed in place. It also kept the light out. I couldn&#x27;t go back to another type of mask. Sleep Master has me sold! Really a great mask.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I love this sleep mask and it&#x27;s really comfortable, but I promise you that once you put this sleep mask on your face and roll over to kiss your wife or husband good night they will most certainly burst out laughing hysterically.  At least my wife did which led to countless jokes in bed that night regarding the size of the mask and the satiny fabric that it&#x27;s made of.  If you want a comfortable night sleep and a goodnight laugh then buy this sleep mask!</li>
    <li> This masked is shipped with a set of very nice foam earplugs. Together they do very good job blocking 99% of sound and light. The fabric of the mask is very soft and pleasant to touch. Unlike many other sense blocking masks, it is wide in every dimension. It is wide enough to cover ears and eyes, and it is wide enough to wrap around head and secure with hook-and-loop. The vendor gets two thumbs up too.</li>
    <li> The unique and special part of this sleep mask is that it covers the ears unlike other masks. This permits your ear plugs to stay in place through the night unlike when you don&#x27;t have this on. Between the two functions of covering your eyes and covering your ears, you are guaranteed a beautiful sleep.</li>
    <li> This did not work for me. It moved around during sleep and I could not sleep on my back as the velcro forms too big of a lump</li>
    <li> Have had these for quite sometime and enjoy them. They are adjustable so your are lashes are not stuck against your face and the satin is gentle on your hair style. They keep the light out without feeling like you have a rubber and around your head! A luxurious solution!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s heat trapping and became uncomfortable before I could fall asleep the first time I used it. I was done right then and there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 6&#x27;4&amp;#34; tall and I weigh 270 lbs. Even if I didn&#x27;t have a spare tire, I&#x27;d be a big guy. I bought these because they are highly reviewed, despite being pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The material is soft and comfortable, and the padding is excellent. Generally speaking, the mask covers my face without a lot of leaking light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint, that keeps me from five stars, is that for me, the mask is a tad short. To be able to close the velcro at all I must pull the ends very tight across the back of my head, so tight that when laying in some positions I can feel my pulse against the mask. Another quarter inch on each side would be sufficient for me to loosen the velcro such that it would stay on my head but be considerably more comfortable. I may have to have somebody break out a sewing machine to alter it.</li>
    <li> I do like this stays in place and works</li>
    <li> This is amazing! When I&#x27;ve got a headache and need to block out the light this really helps. It&#x27;s very comfortable to sleep with on and no, it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t block out sound but I didn&#x27;t expect it would.</li>
    <li> I bought this to take with me to a deployment in the desert. I&#x27;ll be working overnight and since I have to sleep in the day I knew I needed something that was nothing short of great. While this is the most comfortable sleep mask I&#x27;ve evern worn (tried it on for a minute), it has one flaw as mentioned by another reviewer. The mask puts a slight tension on your eye lids. I&#x27;m sure it wont be a big deal, but it&#x27;s definitely worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen a few reviews mentioning the noise blocking isn&#x27;t good at all. It does come with a pack of ear plugs but if you bought this for any reason other than a sleep mask--cover the light while you sleep.. then that&#x27;s on you. This isn&#x27;t meant to block out all the sounds. It does wrap around your whole face, eyes and ears included, but nothing fancy. It is comfortable, it even looks it in the picture. $25 is pretty steep for it in my opinion, but I needed the best for my deployment, as I can&#x27;t expect to replace it while I&#x27;m out there.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mask!  It is so soft, satiny &amp; comfortable!  It blocks out all of the light &amp; as an added benefit, it covers your ears for a bit of noise reduction, too!  I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> I found a lot of stains on this sleep mask .At first i thought it&#x27;s used but after i saw  it under a good lighting i think it&#x27;s from the fabric coloring .I will wash it before i use it anyway</li>
    <li> feels good while on, but easily falls off if you move your head. I found it impossible to stay on my eyes all night. This could be a problem with pretty much all sleep masks.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife so I can now watch John Wayne movies at 2:00 AM without her complaining.&lt;br /&gt;The bishop of my Church also approved the use of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim Summers</li>
    <li> I live in Alaska and this sleep mask helps a lot in the summer when we have 22 hours of daylight. It completely blocks out all the light and is very comfortable!</li>
    <li> This sleep mask darkens to perfection. The nose area is completely comfortable and the inside area, the area that touches your eyes, is comfortable as well.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase. It cuts all light and it is very comfortable. It is easily adjustable and the statin material is very soft.</li>
    <li> This is the third I&#x27;ve ordered for other people. Simply amazing great sleep mask!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Great for traveling&lt;br /&gt;Headaches&lt;br /&gt;Early sunrises or white nights&lt;br /&gt;Just plain beauty and wrinkle protection around eyes&lt;br /&gt; If you have headaches or If you have migraines this would be a fantastic thing to have because it can put circumference pressure on your head compressing the cranial bones for relief and It has a Velcro back that adjusts for yr head, soft and satiny feel to the mask and wide head wrap so it can cover your ears and you could wear ear plugs I. If you want. I don&#x27;t need to use this mask but the early 4am daylight wakes me up and sometimes I don&#x27;t want to be up that early this keeps me sleepy longer. I  have been getting more weird dreams from this though I don&#x27;t know what the cause is, maybe more pressure on my head? It&#x27;s a very nice color. Made in USA nod overall a wonderful product. I&#x27;ll definitely get more</li>
    <li> This is one of the best investments of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a truck driver, and my truck does have curtains, but very often the only problem in getting to sleep would be one parking lot light hitting me right in the face.  This mask nullifies lights light that, allowing me to feel like I am in a 95% dark room.  I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is PERFECTLY comfortable—I stop feeling it a second after I put it on.  It also covers the ears so it deadens noise somewhat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very well made. It does not have a sown-on strap; the mask is one piece with a velcro fastener, so it is infinitely (easily) adjustable and not going to wear out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to wash, also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny.  I will probably buy another.</li>
    <li> For a cool night this works fine. shield totaly from the light and offer enough muff for the ears. Do consider feeling the extra pading while sleeping on it. I sleep on a contour pillow and this kind of change the contour I am sleeping on. Also, it gets pretty warm on a summer night.</li>
    <li> Prior to this sleep mask, I was using the [[ASIN:B0027OUUFW Tempur-Pedic Sleep Mask]] (~$40) which does work very well and is quite comfortable, but the velcro portion really gets tangled in long hair which does not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS mask is very light, provides good coverage (not quite as complete at blocking out light as my prior mask, but much better at blocking out sound)... and the velcro area is small enough and sewn in carefully enough that it does not get tangled in my hair as I toss and turn. This holds true even when I&#x27;m wearing large sleep rollers. Seriously. I wish someone would come out with a really great sleep mask that didn&#x27;t need velcro, but until then this will do. One word of warning if you are hard to wake - this mask does muffle sound quite well. You may want to either secure it a bit loose or put the alarm closer to you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many masks over the years and this is the first one that is so comfy I forget it&#x27;s on. It&#x27;s also 100% light blocking, something else most masks are not. It does muffle sound but not like ear plugs would. If noise were a huge factor, I&#x27;d use both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this mask.</li>
    <li> This exceeded my expectations, I love this mask. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought one for myself knowing that I needed a little something extra, boy does this fit the bill. I love this mask. Prompt delivery and just as it was described. I will buy from them again.</li>
    <li> This is super comfortable and does a great job of blocking out light.  It doesn&#x27;t stay on all night for me, but that&#x27;s the only downside.  I could probably tighten it but I&#x27;d rather have a looser fit.</li>
    <li> If you use cpap, this is a great sleep mask! Love it!</li>
    <li> While the idea of a full-coverage sleep mask is appealing at first, the Sleep Master failed to live up to my expectations. The mask applied a lot of pressure on my eyes and the strap was uncomfortable when moving my head around. Even with the increased area, some light still leaked. I recommend a smaller, more traditional mask instead of this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different sleep masks, and for a few common reasons, they have all fallen short.  Some aren&#x27;t of a high enough build quality to last more than a few months.  Others pull at your hair with elastic bands or constantly slip off the top of your eyes, causing light to shine in and awaken you when you&#x27;re trying to sleep in.  Others just don&#x27;t fit well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sleep Master seems to resolve those issues.  While it&#x27;s a little bit more expensive, I think the additional sum is worth the cost.  First, though I&#x27;ve only been using it for about two months, the materials and build quality seem like they will last longer than the other masks I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon; those only lasted about three to six months of nightly use, at which point elastic bans started fraying and liners started pulling off.  The material is very soft, so unless you&#x27;re allergic to it, it should not irritate your skin or cause you to itch.  The large shape extends well below the eye, permitting the mask to move a bit more without exposing your eyes to light, and it seems better at accommodating a wider range of nose shapes and sizes than the others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to cite a drawback, it&#x27;s that the way the mask&#x27;s Velcro straps in back, it makes a bit of a bump that can be uncomfortable to sleep on if you have a firmer pillow and sleep on your back.  Overall, though, I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with this latest mask, which I pair with ear plugs for a good night&#x27;s rest in heart of a busy city.  For a light sleeper, this combination is a Godsend.</li>
    <li> I hesitated to buy this mask because it seemed overpriced at $25.90.  I&#x27;m glad I went ahead with the purchase.  It&#x27;s extremely comfortable, feels durable, and blocks light very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update August 30, 2014 - This mask was an excellent purchase.  Still super-comfortable, great at blocking the light.  I typically start to sleep without it, then put it on in the early hours of the morning if I wake up.  This masks doesn&#x27;t even belong in the same category as those Lone Ranger style masks, it&#x27;s that much better.</li>
    <li> Cuts out light deadens sound. It is adjustable and can be washed.  Most of al if is &amp;#34;Made I the USA.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This Sleep Mater Sleep Mask is wonderful.  I cannot sleep without it!  It truly has change my sleep into a rejuvenating restful sleep experience. I will not go anywhere with out it.  Love it !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Awful, didn&#x27;t work at all, and customer service was a joke.</li>
    <li> This mask is wonderfully soft etc. but it is not contoured around the eyelids...so there is constant pressure.  I don&#x27;t like that at all and can&#x27;t use this mask because of it.</li>
    <li> Nicely blocks out light.  The silky feel of the material is so comfortable and soothing.  Cool on your skin, too!</li>
    <li> This mask is very comfortable and it does a great job of keeping light out. The one major drawback is that since it covers your ears, they end of getting moist and humid feeling. In the end, I bought another mask that didn&#x27;t cover up my ears.</li>
    <li> The idea is great, price is high, but for me there was too way much bulk to be laying on.</li>
    <li> I really love this mask. I have used others that leave indents or marks (not great) this one is so comfortable I forget it&#x27;s on. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Comfortable and easy to use, but lets light leak in near the nose area. Mmm, what else can i say,oh and it doesn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s position ver well. I find myself adjusting it often to keep it in place</li>
    <li> I had been searching for a sleep mask for my husband but could only find flimsy and small versions. This mask is large, soft and thick and most of all,  comfortable! He finds it very easy to wear and it blocks out the light perfectly. He also likes that it goes over his ears and securely around his head. He&#x27;s very pleased with and loves the mask - cannot compare to the old one it is replacing! Can find no fault, plus very prompt delivery - I would gladly buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> Good overall product I bought many months ago and have used plenty.  Nice and soft, has a good wrap and stays on pretty nicely.  I got it mostly to block out the sun and have ear plugs in for sleeping during the way or when I don&#x27;t want anything to wake me up. They hold in the ear plugs well (ear plugs normally fall out while I sleep). It blocks out all light well and is very comfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> Soft and blocks out all the light I need it to block. Love it!</li>
    <li> I really like this mask a lot, but it&#x27;s not perfect. It definitely blocks out all the light, which is the main reason I bought it. My only issue is that because it covers my ears (supposedly for noise reduction, but it you believe a little piece of fabric causes noise reduction, well that&#x27;s on you)  I get very hot in the summer. Also, my ears don&#x27;t like being squished against my head and sometimes they are sore when I wake up.  I will say that I sleep on my stomach so I don&#x27;t know how the mask fares with the velcro behind my head pressed on a pillow. I only wish they made one with thinner side straps to give my ears some breathing room, but other than that, I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a Christmas gift to my friend who works night shift and sleeps day time. He really loves this mask, which is silky comfortable. He appreciated for this gift to me for several times at different occasions. Now I will buy another one for myself.</li>
    <li> I ordered this mask because we have no blinds yet at our new place and my fianc&amp;eacute; needs total darkness in order to be able to sleep. I thought it would be a great Christmas stocking stuffer but I ended up giving it to him weeks earlier, as soon as it arrived, because he kept complaining about not being able to sleep. He&#x27;s quite picky too so this one had to deliver or else. Well, I didn&#x27;t hear a peep from him as soon as he put it on. And I haven&#x27;t since. Mission accomplished. This thing stays on and does its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if you could also build a snore-neutralizing mechanism into this you&#x27;ll start a revolution. You could call it the Sleep Mistress Mask.</li>
    <li> I bought this mask as a gift for a sister who shares a room with a woman who leaves on her TV and lights all night. My sister RAVES about it! She has thanked me a dozen times for finding a solution to her previous sleepless nights. She has told me it completely blocks out all light, muffles sound (because it covers the ears) and is soft and super comfortable to wear. A great product!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he liked it so much I want to get one for myself! I&#x27;ve used other brands of sleep masks before, but was always annoyed was when the masks would always ride up onto the top of my ears, and eventually the whole thing rides up. This mask wraps AROUND the ears very comfortably, thus staying on without having to wrap it so tightly that it&#x27;s uncomfortable. Would highly recommend this mask...so comfortable!</li>
    <li> This mask is made with really good material and feel comfortable when it is on. Not too heavy, and not too light. The velcro in the back keeps it secure. Helps me fall asleep during the day, due to the fact that I work during the night. The only thing is that when I wake up the mask has fallen off, but I don&#x27;t mind, I only need it to help me fall asleep.</li>
    <li> Love the soft, satin material that this sleep mask is made of, it is not hot and remains cool throughout the night. Provides superior covering, helps reduce noise, as well as keeping the light out of your eyes. So if you need a good nights sleep &amp; you like it dark, this is the mask for you! I have tried several different sleep masks, and personally I am extremely pleased with this one! I know you will be too. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have purchased allot of sleep masks and this by far is the best one I have ever used. It is light weight and I love the material. It&#x27;s silky. Great buy! Love it!</li>
    <li> This has been one of my best buys on amazon. It does exactly what it says and really helps you sleep.  I use mine mainly for traveling (it&#x27;s terrific on long haul flights!) and it&#x27;s worked better than I could have expected.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier - and super fast shipping too. :-)</li>
    <li> Great sleeping mask.  I am one of the unforunate night time workers who must sleep during the day.  The Sleep Master has greatly helped with my daytime rest.  Although i wish I could sleep at night, the job I do requires downtime for most of the world for me to maintain the interworkings of networks and ancillory equipment.  The mask is a marvelous tool for me to complete my rest and perform my job.  The mask is highly recommended for the people who are not always in the main stream of sleep patterns.[[ASIN:B0015NZ6FK Revolutionary, Patented SLEEP MASTER Sleep Mask]]</li>
    <li> I like this particular mask because it doesn&#x27;t put pressure on the eyeballs, nose bridge, or ears. The fabric is soft and luxurious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing you should know is that this mask can slip off while sleeping because there isn&#x27;t an elastic band to hold it tightly around your head. You can adjust the tightness of mask with the velcro (i.e. hook &amp; loop) on the straps that wrap around the head. But if you&#x27;re like me and you don&#x27;t like it tight, then it might fall off occasionally if you roll around in your sleep.</li>
    <li> Very nice mask. Soft feel on the face and definately keeps everything dark. A little heavy compared to others and adjustable to size.</li>
    <li> Great for meditation sessions. Sleeping in a bright room or where someone has a light on and you are trying to sleep. Good for car and good for flying. Recommend it.</li>
    <li> I work nights. Even with the blinds and curtains, the room I sleep in is pretty bright. This mask is awesome. I bought it 3 years ago and I&#x27;m still very satisfied with this purchase. If you work nights and sleep during daylight hours, I strongly recommend you get this product.</li>
    <li> I like the item, but it makes you sweat too much when sleeping all night with it on. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This is the best sleep mask ever! It completely blocks all light and stays in place all night. Once on, I never think about it again.  I ordered an extra one to carry on trips. This product was delivered just as promised!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;d probably give this a 4 if it wasn&#x27;t priced so much higher than most other sleep masks.  the fact is, it works ok but has one fatal flaw, in my opinion, and that&#x27;s that there&#x27;s nothing covering the bridge of the nose.  it&#x27;s obvious from the pictures, but i didn&#x27;t put 2 and 2 together until i actually used it.  with nothing covering the nose, any little movement will slightly adjust the mask and light will come in from the nose gap.  on top of that, even when positioned perfectly, it doesn&#x27;t block light quite as well as i&#x27;d hoped.  during the summer when the sun rises early i still find myself having to position a pillow between me and the window to block a little more light.  like i said, it&#x27;s a decent mask, but i&#x27;ve bought ones for $1.50 that were almost as good.</li>
    <li> I love this mask. The reviews helped me decide on my purchase, and I&#x27;m glad I tried it. I bought it initally for travel, but tried it at home. Slept so well that I&#x27;m using it every night now. One evening I forgot to turn off the ceiling fan light, and I didn&#x27;t even notice - it keeps out the light that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very soft and comfortable. Not bulky. I have long, thick hair, and I don&#x27;t want to have marks in my hair in the morning from the band, so I lift up my hair from the upper area of my head, clip it, and strap the face mask underneath. I sometimes unclip my hair, sometimes leave it up. Makes for a nice tight fit that doesn&#x27;t move around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I get up at night, I simply need to slide it up my forehead a bit to see my way around, then slide it back down when I get to bed. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am naturally a terribly light sleeper, with sleep apnea, and as such every night is a battle to get and stay asleep. To make matters worse, my bedroom windows overlook the apartment complex parking lot, which is lit up with the very bright \\&quot;daylight\\&quot; type of street light. After trying several sleep masks and finding fault with each one I decided to spend the extra money and try this one. It works beautifully. It&#x27;s comfortable, conforms to my face closely without digging in and blocks the light completely. Additionally, I have sleep apnea and this mask works very well with my C-PaP. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I just received the product last night and I am shipping it back. I don&#x27;t see the difference between this one and $5.00 product. It does not block the light completely. Some of these reviews are there just to sell the product not to provide best review.</li>
    <li> I have suffered with sleep problems for several years and have probably owned about 5 or 6 other sleep masks that don&#x27;t even compare to this one. With other styles I&#x27;d wake up in the morning and not even know where my mask was. Only to find it on the floor or wedged somewhere between the mattress and headboard. They just never really stayed put. This mask stays in place all night and fits comfortably. It blocks out light completely but as a secondary bonus it holds my earplugs in place all night long. It has helped me tremendously and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who was tortured with sleep issues like me. I literally find myself in a bit of a panic if I wash it and it hasn&#x27;t fully dried by the time I need to use it again, so I&#x27;m buying myself a backup now. It is a little on the pricey side but for me, this is a MUST have.</li>
    <li> I love this mask!  Easily the most comfortable sleep mask that I have ever owned and I have gone through plenty.  I can&#x27;t believe these masks aren&#x27;t everywhere yet.  And did I mention that I love this mask?  Because, you know, I do!!</li>
    <li> I purchased my first ever sleep mask from CVS.  It was white.  I soon learned that it was a very silly thing to have a white sleep mask.  My second mask, while blue, had an elastic strap which quickly lost its hold.  So, I found myself on Amazon, looking for a new sleep mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I found this...the Sleep Master.  The smooth blue satin feels amazing over my eyes at night, but the very best thing is that this mask is big enough and allows for correct adjustment to ensure that _no light sneaks through_.  Amazing.  Even the light of a charging cell phone bothers me at night, but no more!  And I know I will have this for a good long time to come as the strap is Velcro...no more falling off my head in the middle of the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask is so wonderful, I have already purchased one as a gift for my husband.  He works at night, so this is perfect for daytime sleepers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and I highly recommend it to anyone in the market for a sleep mask...and a good night&#x27;s sleep!</li>
    <li> Totally amazing! I purchased AcousticSheep SleepPhone speakers (they are flat) and attached to the mask with velcro and now I can sleep listening to meditation music from Pandora. My wife had multiple surgeries and now snores and I just don&#x27;t have the heart to wake her up. Using this mask with the flat speakers has been a blessing from heaven.</li>
    <li> Product sleep mask is comfortable, however:&lt;br /&gt;1. Warning the silk material will wake you up, if you sleep on your side &amp; make the slightest movement w/your head, the sleep mask will make noise.&lt;br /&gt;2. It woke me up countless times in the night that I had to remove the sleep mask off my face while I was half asleep.&lt;br /&gt;3. The silk wraps over your ears which is why when the sleep mask rubs against anything, it will echo into your ear &amp; wake you the way it did to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now some may mention that the sleep mask came w/free ear plugs:&lt;br /&gt;1. Well that was a big mistake, the ear buds only make the noise problem worse, because any slightest rub against the ear plugs will amplify into your ear even further as the ear plugs are deep into your ear.&lt;br /&gt;2. The noise sounds like when the doctor uses that thing to listen to their patients heart beat, but just imagine rubbing it against a fabric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would only recommend this for people who only want to minimize their sound if their live in loud environments.&lt;br /&gt;However, if you want/need complete silence to sleep, then I DON&#x27;T recommend this product at all, big waste of money I assure you that.</li>
    <li> Best sleep aid I ever bought. No problems sleeping now!!!</li>
    <li> As a college student, I have finally been able to get some restful sleep at night. Combined with ear plugs, I can now sleep at any time.</li>
    <li> The mask is made of a satin type of material.  It is wide but not thick.  It wraps your entire head from front to back and fastens with a velco.  The problem lies with the nose area and the material.  Unfortunately it does not conform to your face so depending on the size of the bridge of your nose,there will be a gap allowing light to go through.  I have a medium size nose and face so it will appear even the average person may have a problem.  Furthermore, the material is very slippery.  After fastening it tightly, I could still turn it completely around.  In summary, the design flaws provents a custome fit and the material is not suitable because as you toss and turn in bed you have to keep adjusting.  I returned the product.</li>
    <li> I was a little surprised at how well this mask worked. I have a prominent nose arch and the mask fits quite well. It really does block out the light like the product description says. It&#x27;s also fully adjustable to fit a smaller head such as mine and my hair doesn&#x27;t get caught in the velcro. The only thing I would suggest to the manufacturer is add a little more velcro to the back so when it&#x27;s adjusted for a small head the very end of the mask doesn&#x27;t lift up. Otherwise, I am pleased very with this purchase and will recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine gave me a Sleep Master Sleep Mask for Christmas since she knows I have always had trouble sleeping. I have tried others but this sleep mask is the best I’ve found. It’s soft, cool, lightweight and comfortable to sleep in. It is easily adjusted to your face/head and stays put while you sleep. I take this sleep mask with me when I travel which is especially helpful when I’m in a different time zone. I highly recommend this sleep mask to everyone!</li>
    <li> This is a good mask.  It&#x27;s comfortable, blocks out the light, and doesn&#x27;t make you hot.  The velcro strap is nice and allows easy and comfortable adjustment when putting on.  Sound is not blocked so you won&#x27;t have to worry about missing your alarm.</li>
    <li> The sleep mask is well made and has a comfortable material. I like the wrap-around feel. If you never sleep on your back (or on an airplane) then you&#x27;ll like it. But if you need to put pressure on the back of your head and neck, you will be annoyed by the bulk in the way, which interferes with sleep. I have tried this thing a lot over a few months. I want to like it. I just don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I like this mask a lot.  I starting wearing it when the weather was pretty warm  and it might be a little warm for some folks in the heat of summer.  Next summer I might switch to something lighter, I am not sure.  I thought it was going to be wonderful in the winter and it is.  We turn the heat down to 64 at night and it is sort of like wearing (comfy)  ear muffs or a hat to bed.  Keeps my head and face cozy and of course totally blocks the light (the main purpose)  and muffles noise a tiny bit too.  It is a quality product.  I don&#x27;t mind spending this much on something that I use every single night for months at a time.  So for me an added benefit is the warmth.</li>
    <li> I read some of the critical reviews so didn&#x27;t know what to expect. This mask felt divine; it stayed on well and I&#x27;m a side sleeper; didn&#x27;t affect my REM (as I remember at least one of my dreams);  the padding felt good; didn&#x27;t bother my eyes; and I did not notice the Velcro except for the ease of putting it on.  So glad I purchased it.  I also ordered another sleep mask at the same time which had the raised eye parts based on some complaints, but I fear it will not be as comfortable as this one.</li>
    <li> I simply cannot sleep with out this product. I&#x27;ve tried multiple eye masks and nothing works as well as the Sleep Master. I bought my first one in 2011 and I just ordered my second this year (2014). I know I had some concerns originally about sheet staining however I never had an issue, and we only have white sheets. I would recommend this to anyone who is a light sleeper like myself. The company is also amazing when it comes to answering my questions.</li>
    <li> HOLY COW, I LOVE THIS THING!!!!!!!  My wife stays up late watching TV, etc and this has been a goft from the sleep gods.  I have never used a mask before and kinda went out on a limb trying this.  It has changed eveything about my sleep.  Light stays completely out and the thick sides cover the ears enough that I hear the dog bark and alarm system but the TV (turned down) doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  I&#x27;ve washed it several times now per instructions and have not seen ANY change in quality, etc.  I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product!</li>
    <li> I bought two sleep masks, this one and the&amp;#34;Ultra Soft 3D Contoured Eye Mask&amp;#34; (see my review there).  This one did not work for me at all. It is just a flat piece of soft fabric with a triangle cut out for your nose. It lies flat against your eyes, which personally I can&#x27;t stand because my eyes feel squished. The velcro headband in back got tangled up in my hair. Finally, this does not work AT ALL with a CPAP so don&#x27;t even try. Buy the other sleep mask, which is 100% successful in every way and much less bother.</li>
    <li> I CANNOT PUT THESE ON BY MYSELF.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this mask.  It is comfortable material and blocks out light really well.  The fact that it covers my ears is also helpful with muffling sound.  It does slip a little bit during sleep, but not as  much as most masks I&#x27;ve tried.  Other masks I&#x27;ve used have come right off during sleep, but the worst this one does is maybe rotate a little. It also doesn&#x27;t get stuck in my hair like a lot of other masks do.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a comfortable sleep mask.</li>
    <li> I am a side sleeper, and I found this mask to be very uncomfortable for me.  The Velcro straps that secure the mask are very long, I&#x27;m sure to allow the to fit big and small headed people alike.  However, since I&#x27;m on the smaller end of that scale, the straps overlapped considerably and created an annoying bump that dug into the side of my head when my head hit the pillow. The fabric is very nice, it does a good job of blocking out the light, but I can&#x27;t sleep with it fastened. They really should consider offering a couple of different sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be taking a long overnight plane trip soon and am hoping that it will be more comfortable in an upright position.</li>
    <li> Finally! A dark room. Doesn&#x27;t really help with noise, but that&#x27;s not a problem for me.</li>
    <li> Great for my needs!  It covers my eyes very well and gives me the comfort of covered ears.  In its self it doesn&#x27;t really block sound, but it help tremendously with keeping ear plugs in all night if I need them (I spend quite a lot of time in hotels).  I&#x27;m getting a second one so I have one when the other is getting washed.</li>
    <li> Works but a bit expensive considering the simple design and materials.</li>
    <li> Item was just as good as advertised!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I will be sending for another one for my wife very soon!</li>
    <li> Best sleep mask I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I have bought many of these but finally had enough. The material wears away so quickly that I have to get a new one every few months because the fibers will ITCH me to death and is so awful that i would rather be without a mask!</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed the service and product, recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Excellent for travel also ! Second one I buy</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product but i can&#x27;t.  It is very comfortable but very hot.  An adjustable strap across the top would be helpful to keep the mask from sliding down in the back.</li>
    <li> I loved the first one I received.  It worked just right.  So, I ordered another for my husband 2 weeks later.  It arrived and it&#x27;s narrow.  Much smaller.  It does not cover the ears.  And it keeps letting in light, whenever I move.  Very disappointed!  I would love another big one, but I don&#x27;t know how to order one.</li>
    <li> this thing is amazing. I knock out real fast now! Between this and my earplugs, I am sleeping so much better!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s more comfy than the average eye-masks. Although, I prefer Eye Gloves that I lost on a long airplane trip, no longer sold on Amazon. This product has a nice look and feel; does not feel cheap or poorly made at all. The only complain I would have is that it can let some light in through the nose &amp;#34;divider&amp;#34; section. Also, in the beginning one might struggle with the right fit in regards to the tightness and the positioning of it. Still, I would probably recommend it. It should make a good gift too, given that it has a luxurious feel to it.</li>
    <li> Love this sleep mask. It is really comfortable and blocks out all light. Between my work shift and getting migraines, I have a lot of trouble sleeping and this has helped me immensely since I started using it. I have tried a few others with the elastic strap on the back that would pull my hair or slide off my eyes whenever I would move which would wake me up after I had actually fell asleep. The adjustable velcro strap allows me to loosen or tighten it depending on how I am laying and whether I have a headache or not.  I have tried to use every style of earplugs but they would not stay in my ears and the ones that came with this mask do, even if I am not wearing the mask. The mask just gives a little extra holding power to keep the earplugs in. It is silky and slightly padded so when I roll around it is still comfortable and doesn&#x27;t stick to the pillowcase. I was concerned about the cost because others that I have tried were so much cheaper but that is just what they were, cheaper. This works and is comfortable so I have to admit that the cost of this would have been cheaper had I bought it before trying all the cheap ones that didn&#x27;t work or I wouldn&#x27;t use because they were so uncomfortable. My only regret about this mask is that I didn&#x27;t purchase it a long time ago.</li>
    <li> I bought this over a year ago and it is still holding up well.  It does a good job of blocking out the light.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that there are not &amp;#34;cups&amp;#34; for the part that goes over the eyes like other sleep masks have, so they sit directly on your eyes.  Because of this I have to wear it a little loose which lets in some light.  But, for my needs I don&#x27;t need 100% light blockage from my sleep mask.  Also, easy cleaning, just throw it in the wash.</li>
    <li> Beautiful item; comfortable to wear. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this item!</li>
    <li> Ordered this for client, she said this item is awesome!!! She sleeps so much better now</li>
    <li> It is ok, I expected a little more of a muffle of outside noise from the reviews.</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t As Good As I Thought</li>
    <li> Comfortable and cool on the skin these do  just what they say!</li>
    <li> I bought this for an upcoming hospital stay for my neuro surgery. I&#x27;ve been testing it out and I love it. It&#x27;s soft and smooth to the touch; very comfortable to wear and blocks out the light really well. I love the design - stays in place so much better than others I&#x27;ve bought. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I was in the dorm room where my roommate would stay up and have his laptop on. This mask was a life saver Im pretty sure I would have lost my mind if it wasn&#x27;t thanks to this mask letting me get a good nights sleep! Its so comfortable!</li>
    <li> Good mask, but it doesnt have indents for your eyes to be able move in rem sleep. it lays flat on top of eyelids. it takes a bit to get used to. Also though it wraps over your ears, it does little to reduce any noise, but that is what the earplugs are for. Also a little pricey for what you get compared to other similar items.</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase the Sleep Master Sleep Mask because my partner would stay up later than I would and keep the light on to use his iPad in the bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself feels great. The satin that is used it very high quality and feels cool when first placed on your face. I usually run hot in bed, regardless of the time of year. I need a fan and will always have the sheets kicked off. I was worried that I would be sweating wearing the mask but I never had a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first sleep mask ever. I read reviews of people complaining that they can see light in the nose area of the mask. I noticed the same thing when I tried it on but it makes no difference whatsoever on the overall light reduction. The small amount of light can only be seen if you open your eyes and look at it. When closed, it is complete darkness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While sleeping, it has never come off and keeps a great hold. You are able to adjust the tightness of the mask to your level of satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually hand wash the mask once every 2 weeks if not once a week. My masks nose area will have a little grease from my nose and that will build up after a week and leave an awkward smell. So once a week is usually fine. Takes about a day to dry and after that you are back in business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone looking for a Sleep Mask.</li>
    <li> I never wore a sleep mask before but this is very comfortable, and I enjoy using it. I find it quite satisfactory and I am sure you will, too, should you choose to purchase it.</li>
    <li> The mask is made of good quality and is thick enough that it keeps out all light. It feels nice on the face and wraps around the ears to reduce noise a little bit. It&#x27;s a winner.</li>
    <li> I bought this sleep mask to help me sleep during the day while working midnights.  We have a skylight in our bedroom, so it is very bright during the day.  This mask blocks most (but not all) light, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  I am able to successfully sleep during the day with this use of this mask and the included ear plugs.  It is also very soft and comfortable - I don&#x27;t notice it on my face or my head.</li>
    <li> Really blocks out the sunlight and it&#x27;s very comfortable.  I wear it every night.  The shape also keeps well while traveling.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife who is very sensitive to any light while she is trying to sleep.  She loves it.  The mask is very comfortable and blocks out the light exactly as it should.  It is very soft and has a wide band that fastens in the back which is perfect.  The best mask by far that we have tried.</li>
    <li> My Wife loves it and can wear it through the night.  I previously purchased the Tempurpedic model thinking it was the best, but it doesn&#x27;t work well if you are a side sleeper.  Also the Tempurpedic model applies pressure on your nasal cavities which can be uncomfortable.  The Tempurpedic model might block out more light, but the sleep master is more comfortable and now that my wife has both, she hasn&#x27;t used the tempurpedic model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strap is durable.  This will last much longer than other sleep masks.</li>
    <li> After reading about it on the wire cutter (http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/travel-guide/#eye-mask) I was convinced this was the best.  I even spoke to an owner of the company in Las Vegas and she was a very nice person.  This mask beautifully locks out almost all light, and is quite comfortable.  However, the satin like material that is used tends to fray very easily.  Within a month of owning, little strands of fibre have frayed in the nose area.  This does not degrade the integrity, but the little strands tickling your nose is unbearable.  It&#x27;s like someone sticking a feather in your ear, nostrils, or other sensitive area while you&#x27;re trying to sleep.  I found running a lighter helps to burn off the frayed strands easily, but was not expecting this issue.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is much more useful and comfortable than ones I&#x27;ve used in the past. It fully covers your eyes without feeling obstructive. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> We live in AZ where the sun begins it&#x27;s morning climb very early in the summer. I have always been one to rise with the sun, but sometimes I&#x27;d like to sleep past 5:30 AM! This sleep mask is just wonderful, I can finally sleep past sunrise, it is very comfortable and keeps out the light. I love the wide coverage at the sides and no nagging elastic strap! Very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is so much more than I expected. I thought I was getting some generic mask, I didn&#x27;t realize how much I actually paid for it until the next day. But I couldn&#x27;t have been more satisfied when it arrived!</li>
    <li> I work nights and sleep into the morning. Very comfortable. This blocks out most light. some will come in through the nose a little. Needs washing after a while.</li>
    <li> I love this mask! I currently work nights and sleep during the day and it&#x27;s like having a wonderful pillow for my eyeballs!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t block out as much noise as I had hoped, but it helps 😊</li>
    <li> Bought this sleep mask after seeing all the highly rated reviews. I couldn&#x27;t have been more disapointed after using it. Puts lots of pressure on your eyes (which is bad for them) and retains much more heat than imagined. Also, you have to keep up with cleaning because the satin material absorbs lots of oil from you face and can cause you to breakout. You can actually see the dark area where all the oils from your face and forehead absorb into the mask. The area that I was most disapointed was that it did a poor job at keeping out light. The slit for your nose bends which allows for light to pass through. If you are looking you a mask that blocks out all light this is not the mask for you. One positive is that it wraps around your ears to help diminish sound, however keep in mind that it is very bulky.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to help me sleep during the day.&lt;br /&gt;I work graveyard and don&#x27;t normally get to bed until 8AM. Living in the southwest the suns comes pretty early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product to see if it will help me go and stay asleep, no matter how bright the sun is. It works wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product, excellent Customer Service, quick delivery, product exactly as described and at a very good price.</li>
    <li> It works fairly well but it does move during the night. You cannot put it on tight enough to stop it from moving if you are a restless sleeper. Otherwise it&#x27;s fine</li>
    <li> EDIT:  I&#x27;m keeping my original comments intact for those that initially have trouble as I did but see below for a correction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;------------------------&lt;br /&gt;I have had this eye mask on my Amazon Wishlist for what seems like forever and this past Christmas, my girlfriend finally got it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial impression was that it is the most comfortable eye mask i have ever used and the construction is top-notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, after a few uses, I discovered it&#x27;s fatal flaw, which makes it ultimately unusable:  adjusting the mask snug enough so that it doesn&#x27;t move around or slip off my head during sleep causes the mask to apply a constant, gentle pressure directly on my eyes.  It&#x27;s not painful but after a full night&#x27;s sleep with the mask, I would wake up with blurred vision that would take between 1-3 hours to dissipate.  I experimented a few nights to determine if I was maybe doing something wrong but the issue is persistent or the mask is so loose it falls off.  I have an older eyemask with raised areas over the eye sockets and I even tried wearing that under this eye mask which seems to alleviate the issue but makes the mask more prone to slip out of place and is hotter, of course.  In the end, I decided it was more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed the manufacturer inquiring on this issue immediately after realizing what was happening and it&#x27;s been a few weeks and I have yet to hear back and frankly, don&#x27;t expect to at this point which makes for a poor service experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea if this issue could possibly cause permanent eye damage or reduced vision quality but I&#x27;m not risking it.  Which is a shame because as I stated before, it is the most comfortable eye mask I&#x27;ve ever used ... so comfortable, you don&#x27;t even notice it&#x27;s messing up your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  After initially posting my review, the company reached out to me to acknowledge my concerns andprovided outstanding customer service, as well as being very apologetic that my initial contact to them through their website was not responded to in a timely fashion. They offered some wearing suggestions that I followed that corrected my issues.  I wish there had been a small slip of paper included with the mask that provided the proper wearing instructions or that it was posted on their website somewhere as I found the recommendations to be counter-intuitive.  With other typical masks I&#x27;ve used previously there are one or two elastic bands that go over or around your ears; even with two bands I&#x27;d typically wear both bands a bit high above the ears as to not have the elastic dig into the top of my ears while I slept and with ones that are adjustable I&#x27;d typically have them pretty snug as to not slip off during the night.  I&#x27;d never had similar issues with other masks but I prefer ones with raised cups over the eyes, it&#x27;s just a shame that most other masks are made of cheap material (especially the elastic they all seem to have that wears out in a matter of weeks).  As a matter of habit, I wore this sleep mask the same way as others: high and snug.  That is the wrong way to wear this mask.  The company suggested to me to wear with the back of the mask at the base of my skull and a bit loose.  Now, I had tried loosening the mask on my own as I mentioned above but even wearing directly over the ears, it would slip off.  Wearing it lower as recommended resolved the issues I was having with blurriness of my vision but felt weird at first until I adjusted to it. At the right size for my head to avoid the issue, it feels too loose but does not slip off or move around my head during the night. I&#x27;m still adjusting to it but I&#x27;m happy to report that the blurriness is (mostly) gone.  I&#x27;ve still had a couple of incidents with very minor blurriness but really only noticeable when I reading text on a computer screen (which is crucial for what I do for a living) and is now gonewithin a few minutes after waking up.  I&#x27;m assuming that with continued use I&#x27;ll acclimate to the mask better and that I&#x27;m still a bit hypercritical at this point having initially had such an alarming experience; those that don&#x27;t have to look at a computer screen or read a good bit of text first thing in the morning would likely never notice such an issue, so long as they are wearing the mask correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly urge the company to provide instructions with the masks or at least posted on their website going forward ... even if only a small handful of customers have similar issues such as myself, it&#x27;s a very jarring experience to have your eyesight affected.  As my initial review even stated, it&#x27;s an immensely comfortable mask and I&#x27;m delighted that now I can wear it.  The company is a small family owned business so I know it may not be feasible to start putting instructions in with their existing inventory but I hope to see something on their website at least and that they take my suggestion to heart for future production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I cannot emphasize enough that if my initial review or the handful of other similar negative reviews have put you off purchasing one, just do it.  Per the company&#x27;s website itself and the product description here, they do offer a 30 day money back guarantee so you have nothing to lose.  If you&#x27;ve used one before and were disappointed and had a similar experience as I did initially, take another look.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a really restless, light sleeper and get startled out of sleep at any small noise, and can&#x27;t fall asleep if there is any light on my eyes. This is especially a problem since I&#x27;ve been working nights. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of ear plugs and masks, but I really don&#x27;t like the feeling of having something jammed in my ear (plus there was a bad experience with a piece of silicone ear plug getting caught in my ear canal and causing an infection!). This mask is the perfect solution to block out light and muffle sound without having to introduce foreign objects into one&#x27;s body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do take off one star because the mask sits directly over the eyes, unlike contoured sleep masks. I find contoured sleep masks that allow for free eye movement are less irritating to eyes that suffer from allergies.</li>
    <li> At first thought it was huge! But now I can not sleep without it</li>
    <li> I am a light sleeper.  I never thought I would be able to sleep with anything on my face.  After trying several other sleep masks, I was ready to confirm that thought.  I ordered this mask as a &amp;#34;last try&amp;#34;.  Well, it was the last try.  This mask is great.  It is soft and flexible and during the night, I don&#x27;t realize I am even wearing it.  I have a skylight in my bedroom.  With this mask, I sleep until I wake up, not until the sun wakes me up!</li>
    <li> great - i love it! keeps all the light out and is extremely comfortable  -  soft and squishy but lightweight. it doesnt mess up my hair either which is nice - as long as you put the soft velcro side towards your head. Awesome! definitely try it!</li>
    <li> Comfortable fit that doesn&#x27;t tickle my nose and very good light blocking. The blue material is breathable and very soft, but it does seem to be getting little &amp;#34;picks&amp;#34; in the fabric, possibly from my beard scruff. I also like how it keeps my head warm at night, but I&#x27;ve only used it in the winter so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as being revolutionary and patented... seriously? It&#x27;s a blindfold. If you tie a bandanna over your head, you will get to experience the same sound muffling technology. I can hear my partner breathing next to me while wearing this. In fact, this brings up the only negative I see in this product. Anything that is touching the blindfold (like a blanket) will rub against it when you move (or when the blankets move as you breath) and the rubbing sound is conducted by the smooth material right into your ears. I&#x27;ve found the superior darkness and comfort outweigh this minor inconvenience, but they could probably fix it by using a different material over the ears. Something like micro-fleece.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing mask that I highly recommend.  I am a day sleeper and since I got the Sleep Master I have no problems sleeping.</li>
    <li> Forget about the sleeping pills!  This mask is all you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a Sleep master for over a year, and it&#x27;s been the best investment I&#x27;ve ever made in sleeping!  I&#x27;m a graduate student, and I have an east facing window, and I work nights at a hotel, and I&#x27;m looking for an internship, and doing school work.  I don&#x27;t get much sleep, but the sleep I get is made significantly better with this simple, and comfortable invention.  MADE IN USA!  And that&#x27;s important too.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is  SO comfortable and truly blocks out light.  I LOVE it and would recommend it to anyone needing a good nights rest.</li>
    <li> My wife is happy after years of complaint with other masks. What else do you need to know? It works.</li>
    <li> Most comfortable eye mask ever!!!  Love that it also covers my ears.  Because it&#x27;s not an elastic fit and smooth, slippery fabric, it does move around and I never wake up with it over my eyes.  I bought this because I don&#x27;t like the pressure of the typical strap ones but perhaps if this had some elastic with the velcro closure, it would be even better than perfect!</li>
    <li> This is the best sleep mask on the market!  I have used it for years and will continue to use it for the rest of my life!  You won&#x27;t be sorry if you purchase this amazing product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit different feeling from the usual sleeping masks you find, so it took some getting used to, but after a few times using it, now it feels comfortable. The first difference is that there isn&#x27;t space accommodating for the eyes, but because it is so wide, it does a good job of blocking out the light. It also felt a bit warm the first time wearing it (kind of like wrapping a scarf around your head), but now it feels comfortable, and I can undo the back or take it off for a bit, or shift it to accommodate for warmer temperatures. It doesn&#x27;t feel bulky at all and the satin finish is very nice against the skin. I like the beefy velcro in the back.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a much better product for the price. A lot of light came in around the nose and below the eyes. It lays flat on the eyes, and is VERY heavy, bulky, and hot. I wake up sweating after an hour, and have to take it off. Noise IS NOT blocked. The one good thing I can say about the Sleep Master is the wide velcro closure in the back is nice.</li>
    <li> Working night-shift; trying to sleep during the day can be difficult. I had tried other sleep mask which worked ok,  but wore out too quickly. I gave the Sleep Master mask a try...LOVE THIS MASK..VERY COMFORTABLE AND EASY TO USE. It was not bulky even for it&#x27;s size..the fabric is really soft and comfortable. I even recommended it to others.&lt;br /&gt; It is a little pricey; but so worth it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product! It is easy to wear and blocks out all of the ambient light. It is comfortable and stays in place better than smaller masks with a tiny strap.  My wife likes to read in bed with the light on and this mask allows me to sleep while she reads!</li>
    <li> really works, makes my dream is more pleasant, I have washed many times and is intact.</li>
    <li> Soft, blocks out all light, washable, excellent!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great at blocking out light and the fabric is nice and soft but it&#x27;s really warm and I, more often than not, have to take it off because I&#x27;m too hot.</li>
    <li> with this sleep mask, i can travel anywhere in any condition, along with ear plugs i am prepared for any harsh environment. a must have item</li>
    <li> Although, I have only used it a few times, It is very comfortable and it does block out the light.</li>
    <li> i got this for t he wife because she hates my constant snoring, and i hate wearing those breathe right strips that just feel like they are making my nose spread eagle. she has no problem keeping earplugs in, rolling around in the bed does not knock her mask off to see im up playing xbox at 4 AM, it works wonders, i recommend this to anyone who wants a good nights sleep,loved it so much i ended up getting myself one as well!</li>
    <li> The mask is made of very soft taffeta material, and secures easily. It&#x27;s super soft and isn&#x27;t easily felt once secured.  As it also wraps the ears, some sound insulation results, but tis does not prevent the use of headphones if one chooses to use when resting of sleeping. Almost everything is &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; about this product, so I will just detail the only shortcomings I have found:&lt;br /&gt;1. The mask material is not completely opaque. When trying to sleep in a windowed area, the thing does pass light, even though the light must penetrate two layers of fabric and the filling material.  Wish the interior paddling/filler was completely opaque, but at least the chosen materials are breathable;&lt;br /&gt;2.  The material is absorbent. This means natural oils from the face will discolor the mask.  Keeping it clean only requires a light soak and scrub, then air drying. Don&#x27;t know to how remedy this; am glad coated facing fabric was not used, as it&#x27;s generally toxic. I now wash my face before sleeping, and this cuts down on required washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am happy with this purchase, and hope the company continues to improve the thing!</li>
    <li> If light bothers you this is your remedy..AMANZING</li>
    <li> Worked just fine for my wife until she got an industrial piercing on her ear cartilage. Strap for sleep mask bothered her new piercing, but this is no fault of the mask itself. 5 stars for comfort and light blockage.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve tried a number of sleep masks and this is by far the worst --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) it&#x27;s incredibly bulky, so it&#x27;s not convenient to carry around anywhere&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) it&#x27;s not raised where your eyes are, so it applies pressure to them when you put the mask on.  if you try to reduce the pressure by making the mask less tight, the mass slips down your face.  the pressure also makes your tear up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) the mask looks like something a terrorist would make you wear.  very awkward to wear it in public (like on a plane) compared to a regular sleep mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) it doesn&#x27;t breathe and is very warm.  it will make you sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) any moisture makes the mask darken.  see #2 and #4 above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) the velcro tears up the mask itself.  i&#x27;ve only worn it a few times and it&#x27;s already falling apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bottom line ... this is a terrible product.  don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> Love this mask. Have used many, many others. Actually just ordered another one to keep in my RV.</li>
    <li> This is much too warm for me especially because it covers my ears causing perspiration.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s big and bulky. The thin strip of velcro doesn&#x27;t hold it in position very well but it is positioned in such a way that tightening the mask pulls it tight right around the eyes. I bought it for an overnight flight but have been testing it out at home. So far it&#x27;s on the floor every morning when I wake up. Hopefully it will stay on well enough when I&#x27;m in an airplane seat.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this mask but it doesn&#x27;t really fit easily. I can see light in the corners.</li>
    <li> Love this sleep mask...it&#x27;s my second one....soft and comfortable...keeps the light out!</li>
    <li> The mask is very soft and leaves no creases on the face. It is a bit bulky around the back of the head, but the trade-off of no face wrinkles is worth it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for someone and they love it. Apparently it&#x27;s comfortable and the ear coverage helps.</li>
    <li> I bought 5 different sleeping masks to find the best one and his was second to last. Believe the reviews about your eyes touching the fabric, it does not promote REM sleep and is uncomfortable. The &amp;#34;over the ear&amp;#34; design is great, in theory, but just put a T-shirt over your ear and see if that blocks sound &#x3D; doesn&#x27;t really do anything. If you&#x27;re serious about finding one, get one that has room for you eyes to move while you sleep and something around the bridge of your nose so no light gets in.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these for my husband 10 years ago, and it was finally time to replace it with another Sleepmaster.  It seriously lasted 10 years, thank goodness they are machine washable.  This newer model is a little bit thinner than the old one, but it works out great blocking all light, and very comfortable.</li>
    <li> comfortable&lt;br /&gt;high quality fabric&lt;br /&gt;blocked out lights&lt;br /&gt;comes with ear plugs to block out noises&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does what it supposed to</li>
    <li> This mask is great from the front, but awfully uncomfortable if you sleep on your back. The Velcro backing made it so I couldn&#x27;t get a comfortable position between my head and pillow. I imagine side sleepers wouldn&#x27;t have this issue.</li>
    <li> These are great didn&#x27;t have issues with fit or comfort did as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only the little children on two ten hour flights</li>
    <li> I loved this mask at first because it did not have hard edges that jabbed my temples, but I am revising my opinion because the material that covers it was unbearable in warm weather, became discolored and began to shred.  I do not recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I could still see the light through the mask as my room is very bright! It is comfortable in moderate climate not for hot ones.. It does muffle the sound just a bit.</li>
    <li> The mask is comfortable, blocks all ambient light and muffles sound--but it slips right off my head when I&#x27;m sleeping! Doesn&#x27;t seem to matter if I velcro it on tightly or not, the darn thing works itself up and off my head.</li>
    <li> product is of good quality, covers your eyes very well, soft, comfortable.Went camping  and brought it with me. kept the early Sun out  of my eyes and slept longer But  for the price, two masks would have been a better deal.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my daughter, and she complained that the velcro at the back of the head hurts if you lie on your back. Also, very large and slippery. I have not tried them myself; when I do I&#x27;ll report on them again. Not appropriate for a teen or child.</li>
    <li> Use this as a blindfold, but not to sleep in. The pressure on the eyelids can irritate your eyes during sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks nice, maybe you can have fun with your partner. Just don&#x27;t sleep in it. IMHO. I am disappointed, because anyone making a sleep mask should think beyond how the product looks to the health issues of a bad design.</li>
    <li> The sleepmask is comfortable to wear...the velcro strap is fully adjustable and fits snugly.  However, the satin covering does get warm and causes sweating.  Eventually, the mask gets too hot especially on warm nights.  The mask is not 100% light blocking;  light does come in through the bottom by the nose.</li>
    <li> This eye mask was excellent wore along with the earplugs I slept throughout a 14 hour flight no problem.</li>
    <li> By far the best sleep mask you will ever find! Extremely comfortable and keeps all light out. Quality materials and construction. Worth every penny to get quality sleep.</li>
    <li> It leaks a little bit of light right around the nose cut out, but it is very comfortable and easy to wear.  The included ear plugs are nothing special, but wearing them with the mask does a very good job of blocking most light and sound.  Not so much that I miss the alarm clock, so this is perfect for me.  If what you are going for is total sensory deprivation, though, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> I work nights and needed something to allow me to get the beauty rest I wanted. This did the trick! Not only dark, but also comfortable. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I am a morning person, my wife is not.  She bought this for me because I tend to wake up at the first signs of sun hitting my eyes (which I find annoying myself).  The mask is comfortable easy to adjust and after a couple of nights you barely remember wearing it.  It is easy to wash (follow the directions), It comes with ear plugs but I do not use them.  It dulls noise a tiny bit which is good.  But for anyone who has problems sleeping because of lights or brightness i would highly recommend it.  I take it with me whenever we travel, I have bought one for my wife and she is the same way as myself now.</li>
    <li> I love this mask!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I travel month back and forth to Dubai. My flight is usually 15 hours each way. I&#x27;ve bought a few different \\&quot;high end\\&quot; sleep masks (Brookstone, etc.) but none of them have worked as well or been as comfortable to wear as this one. Add a couple ear plugs to this baby and sleep virtually anywhere!</li>
    <li> I have never used a sleep mask previously. Recently started working a night shift job that requires me to sleep during day. I looked over other sleep mask in stores and they just looked flimsy. Found this product on amazon and decided to give it a try. I am very pleased with the result I am sleeping much better now completely blocks out the light and cofortable to sleep in especially since I am primarily a back sleeper.</li>
    <li> Have tried all the sleep masks out there and by far this one is the best.  It&#x27;s wide and soft, blocks the light, great for migraine sufferers.  I haven&#x27;t had the problems others have mentioned; conventional sleep masks move around on my head much more than this one and leave my eyes vulnerable to air and drying.  The Sleep Master stays put, great for sleeping on your side, comfortable and doesn&#x27;t dig into your face like many do.  Another plus -- I have a drawer full of old sleep masks that are held on by elastic.  After a while the elastic stretches out, frays, gets too loose to use the mask without replacing it.  The velcro closure on the Sleep Master eliminates this problem, it&#x27;s adjustable yet indestructible. Recommended highly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this sleep mask for a couple of months now and it&#x27;s not terrible, but it&#x27;s not great either. See that silky material in the photo? Well, that&#x27;s on the inside, too, making the mask difficult to keep in place. Bonus: it absorbs facial oils and ends up looking a bit nasty. See the visible thickness of the mask? Well, that does block light (when the mask stays in place), but does not block or even diminish noise. As a bonus, it also acts as a sort of brain-baking device, raising the temperature of your head a bit higher than you might want. This is not to be used in hot climes. Or if you&#x27;re a hot sleeper, like me.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and functional. Second time I&#x27;ve purchased this item and they last for years. Launders very nicely. Will purchase again when needed.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my husband.  A first glance he was disappointed that it is quite thick and that the exterior fabric is synthetic.  He was worried it would be too hot and uncomfortable.  However, he has been using it for about a week now, and it seems to help him sleep better between 3:30 and 6 am when the morning sun is coming up.  He also liked that is was made in the USA.  He doesn&#x27;t wear it all night, but just puts it on around 3am.</li>
    <li> The bottom part of the mask DOES NOT block out the light, since it wraps around your ears and is made of cheap material there is a \\&quot;rubbing\\&quot; noise when you move your head on the pillow. Disappointed the manufacturer did not account for these problems when manufacturing it. I would not buy the mask again.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fully adjustable, closes securely, but won&#x27;t snag hair. Straps won&#x27;t stretch or loosen because everything is one piece. Very soft, comfortable, and designed to cover eyes, but not bridge of nose. May still let in some light, but tightening mask more helps or, place small cloth like wash rag over eyes before strapping on mask. Super product. Worth extra cost. Use for migraines, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every mask I bought in local stores was slipshod in materials and function-- a waste of money. I looked online at three different sites and chose this item. It works very well, is made to last, is comfortable (no tension headaches from too-tight straps, no sweating because it is lightweight), and stays put whether one sleeps on one&#x27;s side or not. (I have&#x27;t tried sleeping on my face, but suspect it is snug yet light enough for that, too).</li>
    <li> I liked it until it got dirty from body oils/normal use and had to be washed. (Hand) washed it once, got a few more uses out of it, but after it was dirty again, could&#x27;t get the smell out. Also, it let light in from under the mask, and tended to slip off because of the satin finish. Ended up using wax ear plugs and the BUCKY sleep mask, which I LOVE. Keeps light out and is comfortable, washes well, comes in many colors, and a replacement is $10.</li>
    <li> Still trying to get use to something foreign over my eyes. Don&#x27;t use all the time so that might be the reason it&#x27;s taking a little more time to find my comfort level</li>
    <li> Best sleep mask I have ever used.  Most comfortable.  Blocks the most light.  Very quick on and off using built in velcro strips.  Also dampens noises by covering ears.</li>
    <li> The Sleep Master Sleep mask ROCKS! Finally a sleep mask that blocks out all the light and is comfortable to wear. I wear mine every night and can&#x27;t sleep without it!</li>
    <li> Best eye-mask out there, period.</li>
    <li> Solves the problem of too much light to sleep.</li>
    <li> do shift work - 2 weeks days and 2 weeks nights. I&#x27;ve struggled for 6 months trying to sleep during the day. I was putting aluminum foil over the windows with blackout curtains but when I moved, my landlord wouldn&#x27;t allow it. This product was the answer to my entire problem. It took a few days to get use to having something over my ears but once I adjusted - man, it&#x27;s just awesome.</li>
    <li> Product does not muffle sounds like advertised. The only thing that muffles sounds are the ear plugs that came with it. It&#x27;s rather uncomfortable to wear and the only thing it actually goes is block out light. So basically I just bought an overpriced sleep mask.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through a lot of sleep masks, and this is by far my favorite. Most sleep masks come with straps, which hurt my ears by morning time. This mask is always soft, and comfortable. I liked it so much, I went and bought a second one.</li>
    <li> This does the trick! Soft, comfortable, blocks light, velcros in back, and even blocks out some noise too!</li>
    <li> Keeps twisting and coming off.</li>
    <li> I have two that I rotate through laundry to always have a fresh mask every other day or so.  Sleep with it every night.</li>
    <li> My wife is a chronic headache sufferer.  I am up much later than my wife, mostly working on the computer or watching TV and this mask is great.  It does take a little getting used to because it goes all the way around the head not just behind the ears.  It has a great feel. I bought 3 eye masks to try them out and this was by far the best one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many sleep masks, and this is my favorite yet!  It&#x27;s a great design that helps block out sound. I wouldn&#x27;t say it blocks a ton of sound, but it definitely helps muffle it. My favorite part is the velcro closure. I have long hair, and the mask is wide enough that it&#x27;s impossible for the velcro to get stuck in my hair (ALWAYS happens with other sleep masks). And because it&#x27;s all one piece the back of it cannot stretch out that other sleep masks.&lt;br /&gt;A little bit of light can seep in around the nose, but it&#x27;s less than other masks I have. The problem is that the silky fabric moves easily on your head.</li>
    <li> Not one bit comfortable; gets hot and slips around. A waste of money. Save your money...The Brookstone sleep mask is still KING.</li>
    <li> This is a nice mask. A good size and well made out of nice fabric. But for its price it really should have some molded eyepieces to keep the fabric off the eyes. As it is the mask exerts pressure on the eyeballs. For a product with such a premium price point this aspect of the design should have been considered (and solved).</li>
    <li> I wear a size 8 hat and have struggled with too-tight sleep masks that barely cover my eyes, not to mention the overstretched elastic that is uncomfortable all night. This is the solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched high and low for a larger sleep mask but all of the retail places I tried carried the same brands and styles. When I found this one, I was worried by the complaints about needing extra velcro (how big is that guy&#x27;s head? geesh!) but not any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fits around my big noggin&#x27; and stays in place just fine as I switch from back to side sleeping throughout the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, they could have charged more for this and I still would have felt like I got a good value. Having said that , I hope they don&#x27;t so I can afford to send a few to my family this year...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making a great product that has made my sleep time better!</li>
    <li> the bad news is twofold: (1) it&#x27;s Huge, literally 1/2 the size of my Thermarest compressible travel pillow. that is just not gonna work. (2) it doesn&#x27;t keep out the light, duh. apparently they didn&#x27;t allow for people who have actual noses on their faces. i understand that&#x27;s a rare condition, but nonetheless it makes the product much less useful for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you have a microscopic nose and use this only at home, it&#x27;s probably ok.</li>
    <li> This is great on the plane. It blocks out 95% of the light and a lot of sound. VERY comfortable.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this mask as much, but my husband loved it.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable mask.  It feels so light and does not cause pressure on your eyes.  Does provide some coverage of your ears, so that may turn some people off.  I wouldn&#x27;t claim that this gives any noise blockage though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does slip around a bit if you move while sleeping though and doesn&#x27;t provide complete light blockage unless you pull it down pretty far, but it&#x27;s the most comfortable one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s well made, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to, and the material is a lot less damaging on hair... but it&#x27;s hot. The nights I&#x27;ve worn it were a) because I couldn&#x27;t find my other and b) I woke up covered in sweat. Great in cooler climates and will probably be a go to in the winter months, but for those of you in the South (or similarly WHY IS IT THIS HOT ANYWHERE climates), I&#x27;d recommend looking for something lighter.</li>
    <li> if it didn&#x27;t get so hot, I&#x27;d love this thing. blocks out light and sound wonderfully</li>
    <li> Wife seems to enjoy the feel and comfort.  She even uses it for naps!!</li>
    <li> I git it for my husband. I watch tv in bed at night a little later than he likes and it works very well to keep the light out.  I also have headphones.  It works out well.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended. I have a bunch of cheap masks that all slip off my face, and I honestly thought this might be the same, but figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.  Turns out, this stays in place through out the night and it has a much better &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; on my face than any cheap mask.  I like that there is not an elastic strap and just a wide band with Velcro to keep the mask in place. I sleep on my back and side, and this mask is not noticeable at all.  The cutout for the nose is a nice touch and certainly helps keep the mask in place.</li>
    <li> Wide mask really blocks out the light!  So soft too.</li>
    <li> Blocks out all light - comfortable to sleep and roll around on... is hot over the ear area,&lt;br /&gt;pushes against the eyes... starts cool but I wake in the night and rip it off - feels like too&lt;br /&gt;much of my head is covered.  Great for long hair.  Hmm.</li>
    <li> Long story short, I mistakenly reached out to Sleep Master with a question thinking I had purchased their product when actually I had ordered from a competitor. This was a silly mistake on my part, and before either of us had realized the mistake we were exchanging emails and they sent me a replacement pair of earplugs for a set I hadn&#x27;t even purchased in the first place. When I realized what happened, I apologized and offered to send them back unopened. Their response? &amp;#34;In complete honesty, we feel it is our mission to help as many people as we can get a good night&#x27;s sleep, and feel very satisfied that we provide a healthy, all natural solution. Earplugs are one of those ways.  If that is how we could help you, then that is is line with our mission.&amp;#34; That&#x27;s what I call customer service. If I buy a sleep mask again in the future, I&#x27;m buying it from Sleep Master.</li>
    <li> Great product as described.</li>
    <li> its just a silk mask.</li>
    <li> Very, very large mask! Covers my entire face, and I can&#x27;t keep it on. It slides down to my neck.</li>
    <li> Way too big, so it is really hot and uncomfortable</li>
    <li> Blocks out all the light! Great sleep mask!</li>
    <li> Perfect for sleeping on planes, in loud hostels (especially in the bed next to the door). This sleep mask is silky and smooth, and fits over your ears to help muffle noise which is wonderful.</li>
    <li> This worked better and is more comfortable than the others I&#x27;ve tried (such as PrimerEffects Sweet Dreams) (those fell off during the night). In addition to being larger, the Sleep Master is also thicker, i.e., great when the room temperature is low, not so good if it&#x27;s warm.</li>
    <li> bought this for my sister and she loved it</li>
    <li> Soft, covers any light source, and doesn&#x27;t fall out.</li>
    <li> Exactly as listed. Very happy with product.</li>
    <li> Works great. Used it when I covered a few night shifts and needed everything to be completely blacked out. Also works great for muffling noise.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, it did not work.</li>
    <li> I work the midnight shift and I sleep like a baby with this mask and the earplugs they sent me. THANKS guys great product!!</li>
    <li> This is a nice mask. It looks handmade,  but it is well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it on a recent trip to New York.  I wore earbuds with a white noise recording playing, and wore this mask on top. Together,  they helped make a peaceful night of sleep in a loud city. :)&lt;br /&gt;The combination of the two cut out all of the traffic noise. I don&#x27;t know if either would be sufficient alone.  The mask held the earbuds in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it first arrived,  the packaging was blue. I was worried it would come off the mask and onto my face when sleeping,  so I placed it in a washable garment bag and washed it on the gentle cycle in my washing machine, then hung it to dry. It looked just as good as when it arrived!  ....And my face was not blue with first use. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a great mask for my trip! I&#x27;ll definitely use it again next time.  And I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I suffer from chronic migraines and this mask has helped reduce the outside sounds and lights that can make my migraines worse. I also use this every night to sleep and it is so soft and comfortable.The material is soft and light weight. I don&#x27;t know how I slept before getting this eye mask</li>
    <li> I bought this for my grandson to use in his dorm room at college. He loves it! He can get needed sleep while his roommate is still studying (or watching a video).</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister, who needed it in her dorm. Her roommate kept the lights on late at night &amp; after using some of the cheaper masks (the ones you get in a plane) she started using this mask. She found it to be a great mask that doesn&#x27;t let any light in. The fabric is easy to clean. No more fights about the light in the dorm anymore.</li>
    <li> This is great if you work graveyard like myself. Very comfortable to wear</li>
    <li> The best sleep mask I so far have used.  The mask covers the ears to attenuate sounds but not as much as earplugs so alarms are still audible.  I have purchased three of these items over the years and have been satisfied with them.</li>
    <li> My relationship was saved by this!</li>
    <li> Nice mask.  Definitely does a great job at blocking out light.  It can slip off during sleep tho and can also get hot at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the &amp;#34;sound reducing&amp;#34; padding is a joke, it doesn&#x27;t actually help.  Overall I like this mask and it&#x27;s the best one I have used.</li>
    <li> My husband works most nights and usually gets to bed in the early morning.  For years there&#x27;s been a struggle to keep the kids&#x27; noise level around the house to a minimum until Daddy gets up... And we haven&#x27;t always been successful. :o But, my husband says THIS mask lets him sleep through our activity around the house.  Needless to say we are all VERY happy about it. So, we&#x27;re glad to recommend this mask for households with a day sleeper!</li>
    <li> Promptly shipped. Love the mask. Got it primarily for my wife but I&#x27;ve begun to use mine as well. Excellent light blocking capability and very soft to touch and feels great on the eye. I wear it during nights even when it is not required. Love it.</li>
    <li> I am about to start working nights and past experience tells me I need a new sleep mask.  After reading reviews, I decided to give this one a try.  Wow.  For me it was big and made me sleep \\&quot;hot\\&quot;.  I felt like I was putting on a hood and with the satiny fabric, it slips down on the back.  I know there&#x27;s one out there for me, but this one is definitely not the one.  Sending back today.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have any issues with the blue bleeding or it hurting my ears when put in place. The mask is really comfortable and blocks out all light in the morning which is a big bonus on days I get to sleep past 0700. I&#x27;d recommend this mask over any of the cheaper ones on the site. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous sleep masks over the years and have never found one that was comfortable to wear and stayed on my head.  You name it and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  I was very skeptical because of the price but decided to take a chance.  Boy am I glad I did.  Not only is it comfortable but I was able to adjust it to fit my small head with no problems.  It also helps to drown out my husbands snoring!  The only downside is that when you take it off make sure to do so slowly because it cuts all the outside light out so well that when you take it off during the day it takes you by surprise with the how bright it is without the mask - its that good.</li>
    <li> The sleep mask works as advertised.  I bought it to replace a NAP mask from Brookstone which I lost in a move and I have to say I like this more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It blocks out all light and muffles a decent amount of sound.  Something that was a surprise was the fact that it wraps around your whole head and covers both ears.  It is made of a good quality silky polyester material and is very comfortable to wear. The adjustable Velcro strap will fit any head size and hides well to prevent unwanted snags.  Would defiantly buy another.</li>
    <li> Great. Completely blocks visual field with some exception around your nose if you move around since I don&#x27;t like it too tight. However, feel free to move around while sleeping when wearing it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also bought it off Amazon, and it came quickly even with free shipping (two days)!</li>
    <li> I needed a sleep mask that could block out light when my wife watches late night TV.  I tried a travel sleep mask and it was way too tight and uncomfortable.  The Sleep Master sleep mask works well for me.  I have a larger than normal head so I needed the adjustability this mask provides.  I sleep on my back and on my sides so a bulky mask would not work.  This mask works very well.  It blocks all the light when I sleep on my back and most of the light when I sleep on my side.  My wife uses closed caption on the TV so I don&#x27;t use the ear plugs provided with this sleep mask.  Realistically no sleep mask will work for 100% of the people 100% of the time.  I rated this the Sleep Master 5 stars since it comes as close to 100% for me as I think any product could.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0015NZ6FK Revolutionary, Patented SLEEP MASTER Sleep Mask]]</li>
    <li> After trying several masks this sleep mask was the most plush and comfortable. There are no sleep lines in the morning. I bought one then another because my wife decided to use it! You wont be disappointed. Best sleep mask on the market!!</li>
    <li> This product has a velcro closure system in the back. That system creates bulk behind my head. When I sleep on my back, it feels like there is a lump behind my head (because there is) and my head teeters on said lump. I returned this product because $25 is too much to not be completely satisfied. It may be patented, but the design needs work. Now I&#x27;m going to purchase a mask with an elastic band because it will be much less bulky.</li>
    <li> While the material is great and it really covers your eyes well and also your ears, it is uncomfortable to sleep while wearing this because it wraps around your head completely.  Most good masks will have just a light string around the back of the head so you can toss and turn without being bothered but this is thick all around.  That is ridiculous, if I had known that, I would not have bought it.  Not worth it.</li>
    <li> Really.  This works amazing.  It&#x27;s comfortable, blocks light VERY well, and even blocks some sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  If sound-blocking is important to you, pick something else.  This only covers your ears.</li>
    <li> My work schedule changes constantly so I sleep at different times of the day and night and have used many cheaper masks over the years. This Sleep Master was a gift, which I would not have spent the money on. But now that I&#x27;ve been using it, I can tell you it is a great value for the money. No matter what the time of day, I put it on, fall asleep right away and wake up hours later. What more could you ask from a sleep aid?!</li>
    <li> I work nights, so sleeping in a noisy house during the day is a must. I have come to depend on this product to do just that. Extremely comfortable, though I have to wear the backside down low towards my neck, or the front squeezes my eyeballs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used cheaper sleep masks in the past, the lack of elastic is preferable and this does not allow any light in. This also effectively dampens sound and serves as an ear warmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended it to other overnight staff and strongly urge people to consider this product if they need to sleep during non traditional hours or in areas not preferable for resting.</li>
    <li> Best one I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it. Works much better than any of the sleep masks she&#x27;s tried over the years. Also, because it&#x27;s larger than most sleep masks, it doesn&#x27;t get lost in the bed covers. I&#x27;m getting one for myself now, too.</li>
    <li> The sleep mask is perfect for trying to fall asleep when my husband is still awake with the lights on. I don&#x27;t need it to stay asleep, so the velcro in the back doesn&#x27;t bother me. The item arrived before the promised date and the product is exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I work nights in hospital so i&#x27;m always looking for good sleep mask to help block out the light and let me sleep during the day. On the positive side it does a good job of block out the light, and reducing sounds.It does everything it claims it is supposed to do. But the mask has no space between it and your eyes, so every time I get REM my eyelash brush up against the mask waking me up. I have quit using this mask and went back to my old one. I hope the company reads this and hollows out the padding around the eyes then it would be great.</li>
    <li> Just ordered two more masks for friends as I&#x27;ve been so happy with my original one, which ive had for more than two years.  It looks somewhat like a mini cumberbund and definitely does the trick.</li>
    <li> The Sleep Master Mask is very comfortable and keeps out light and sound.  I am very light sensitive and have found this product to do the trick.</li>
    <li> I love this mask!  It blocks out the light, fits nicely on my head and helps block out some of the sound with the wide straps.  I agree with some of the others, however, in that the lack of eye pockets places slightly uncomfortable pressure on my eyeballs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this mask for a few years, and it makes getting to and staying asleep so much easier for me. I left it at a hotel in Chicago last month, and got a replacement right away.</li>
    <li> This is really the best sleep mask on the market.  Not only does it block the light, but ti&#x27;s comfortable and has a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; feeling to it.  I use this at night when my husband needs to watch tv or play video games in bed.  I also use this on the airplane to block out the rest of the world.  It&#x27;s great for afternoon naps too, or when you have a headache.</li>
    <li> love it! I&#x27;m a terrible sleeper, but this is soft and doesn&#x27;t get hot and actually covers the ears which is great for people who have trouble sleeping. its not just light that bothers me but noise and this mask is a quality product at a good price.</li>
    <li> I love the Sleep Master mask. It is the best mask that I have ever owned. Finally, a restful night of sleep! I will recommend this mask to anyone in search of a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
    <li> slides off due to satin-type material.  fits too close to eyes for comfort.  There are better products.  I prefer a foam-type product.</li>
    <li> When I would try to go to sleep at night my girlfriend wants to do crosswords and she would keep the light on to do them and It would bother me and I couldn&#x27;t fall asleep. With the sleep mask I was able to block out the light and it covered my eyes even after it being on all night. Great product!!!</li>
    <li> Works great for not letting in any light. I found that in order to not be too tight I had to loosen it a bit and therefore it slips off in the night from time to time. I had to get use to the warmth of it.</li>
    <li> Personally I didn&#x27;t like the over the ear mask. It makes my ears hot and itchy.</li>
    <li> I guess it will work better if I am a side sleeper. When I sleep on my back the strap on back of my head is annoying.</li>
    <li> Since my wife likes to sleep with the tv on and I don&#x27;t, one of us had to compromise. &amp;#34;If mama ain&#x27;t happy, ain&#x27;t nobody happy&amp;#34; as the saying goes, so guess who compromised? The mask works very well, it&#x27;s comfortable, and I&#x27;m glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> Works great.  blocks out all the light and fits comfortably</li>
    <li> This is a great product. This has definitely helped my sleep! Keeps the light out and muffles sounds to improve my sleep. Looks good as well.</li>
    <li> One of my good friends recommended this to me, and all of our friends, and as each of us bought one it was a main point of conversation for a while!! (We&#x27;re an exciting bunch). This eye mask blocks out all light but its so soft that you don&#x27;t feel you&#x27;re wearing a mask. Its incredible. Also, I&#x27;ve a habit of taking out earplugs and removing the old fashioned style elastic-band masks in my sleep. But because this is a wide wrap around mask, I wake up with it still on, and fully refreshed having slept through sun-rise!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product. Oh - added bonus, airhostesses are 1000-times less likely to bother you with this on - you look like a serious-sleeper!!</li>
    <li> Is my first mask so I can&#x27;t compare it with others, the mask feels a little big but blocks most of the light it&#x27;s very comfortable and the Velcro doesn&#x27;t bother me or tangles with my hair</li>
    <li> I put this and there was no light peeking through.I also came with ear plugs. This is the ultimate sleeping machine for me since I am such a light sleeper. Thank you got whomever made this product. Even my 11 year old son had his own. I would highly recommend this mask to any and all ages. THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my oldest son.  He has said that this product is comfortable to wear and is effective in blocking light.</li>
    <li> This is very nice and comfortable.  It does block out all light.</li>
    <li> I bought it so that the eyes would remain cool. This gets warm too quickly and I wanted to remove it during sleep.</li>
    <li> The mask is great for the plane rides and if you have to sleep in the day time, also blocks out a little bit of sound but still lets you hear the alarm.</li>
    <li> With me and my hubby on often differing sleep schedules, and my brother living with us on an even more radically different schedule, I was getting desperate for a good night&#x27;s sleep. Lights turned on and off, music, or TVs or computers in other rooms, casual talking, noises outside, quarreling pets - all had the potential to disturb my sleep and often did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other sleep masks I had tried either didn&#x27;t stay put or didn&#x27;t block the light well enough. None helped with the noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This TOTALLY blocks the light for me. It stays put all night. It feels so amazing on the skin. The supposed noise canceling perk is almost too minor to even be worth mentioning; however, this comes with a pair of ear plugs. Ear plugs in the past always came out, but the way the mask is designed, covering your ears, keeps the ear plugs in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy, oh boy! Add those ear plugs and - BAM! - perfect, solid, totally uninterrupted snoozing...at least until the alarm sounds off (which I can still hear just well enough not to sleep through it, even with the ear plugs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down sides are figuring out how snug a fit you need to be comfortable, and sometimes the flaps in the back can dig a little into the skull. You have to find the right tightness for you and where to best wrap the flaps around the back of your head so as not to dig in. That took about 4 days for me but now I am good. A minor disappointment is the lack of options for colors. Blue is beautiful, but I guess I like more variety. Like I said, minor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Husband is asking me to get one for him, too, now! Thanks for a great mask.</li>
    <li> The mask is OK. I think it is a bit over priced but it works OK. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed!!  Product is thin and light shines through around edges.  Must be bound tightly to be kept on head and presses uncomfortably on eyes.  Cannot open eyelids at all.  Worst sleep mask I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Less inexpensive products work sooo much better.</li>
    <li> QUALITY - This product is made of very high quality materials. The silky fabric stays fairly cool even in a somewhat warm room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRICE - Considering the quality of the product, the price is reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DURABILITY - The mask is well made and I expect it to hold up for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DESIGN &amp; FIT - Here&#x27;s where this product gets 4 stars instead of 5. It&#x27;s likely the best sleep mask I&#x27;ve ever had, but it&#x27;s not perfect. Every face is different, so it&#x27;s sure to be perfect for someone. That being said, the closure on the back can be attached in a few configurations to tighten or loosen the mask. In my experience, the tighter the mask is, the better the light blockage but the less comfortable the mask due to too much pressure on my eyelids. It takes some experimenting to get the most comfortable fit, and it takes adjustment to get accustomed to your face being covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the thinness of the material, I&#x27;d venture to say the mask blocks out over 99% of light. The only light that gets in is around the nose, and that’s what requires so much adjustment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EARPLUGS - The earplugs that came with the mask weren&#x27;t bad, but I only tried them on for a few minutes, as I wear &amp;#34;The World&#x27;s Finest Earplug&amp;#34; (a customizable earplug also available on Amazon). One of the nice things about the mask is that it helps keep earplugs in and adds another (if basically superficial) layer of noise blocking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL - I am very happy with this product. It helps me get more quality sleep despite lights being turned off and on frequently during my sleep time (horrible roommates - don&#x27;t ask).</li>
    <li> I have had problems getting to sleep and staying asleep for years.  I used Benadryl for 20 years to help me sleep, and then it stopped working.  I tried herbal teas, Valerian root, melatonin, and even Ambien, which made me suicidal almost as soon as I started taking it.  None of this stuff worked very well, and I just don&#x27;t like taking any drugs or herbs if I don&#x27;t have to. When I reached the age of menopause recently it got even worse, I was going for days with little sleep and I was freaking desperate!  I read about this Sleep Master sleep mask with ear plugs on a Food Renegade email, and although I had tried sleep masks before, when I saw that it didn&#x27;t have an elastic band to keep it on (that hurt my head) and that it helps to keep the ear plugs in, I thought what have I got to lose?  I bought this in February of 2013 and I have slept better in those few months than I have in 20 years.  I get to sleep faster and I stay asleep. I actually slept until 9:30 yesterday - which is just unheard of!!  I don&#x27;t like to sleep that late, but I must have needed it.  I bought contoured ear plugs to go with this as the cylindrical ear plugs hurt my ears.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this, it is amazing!  Do I still have occasionally sleepless nights or restless nights?  Yes, but they have been few and far between and this has been one of the most stressful times in my life.  I am on medical disability, lost my job because of it, I have a family  member who is seriously ill and have lots of worries about that and money worries, and I am still getting the best sleep in years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never really liked a sleep mask and admit the only one I&#x27;d ever tried were the free ones handed out on red eye flights.  A friend was visiting and she had this sleep mask.  I&#x27;d just moved into a new apartment and one of the roof lights would shine right through my bedroom window and onto my pillow. I liked that this mask wrapped around covering the ears, muffling sounds, but not totally blocking out sounds in cases of emergencies. Not only does it block out all light, I feel totally rested when I wake up.  Also, I could never take a nap during the day because I just couldn&#x27;t sleep well when the sun is up; but now I can take more than a 10 minute nap.</li>
    <li> For day sleeping. Works well for my husband who needs to sleep during the day.shipped fast to our home. Good product.</li>
    <li> My husband is very happy with this purchase.  It was well-described in the Amazon listing and it arrived right on schedule.  My husband has a dry eye issue and the use of this mask has really helped him get a restful night&#x27;s sleep.  In the morning there is less trouble with dry eyes because of the mask.</li>
    <li> Just got this the other day, and i&#x27;m happy with it.  I&#x27;ve got insomnia of the worst kind, and i&#x27;m sure this is going to help!  It&#x27;s almost perfectly comfortable (aside from the bridge of the nose).  The problem I have here is this part is a tad too rough, but not to the point where it&#x27;s a big problem.  The fact that it goes all the way around your head is amazing, and it&#x27;s silky soft material is great.  It wont block out sound, but will surely hold in any earplugs if you use those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:  Buy this mask, you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
    <li> Awesome quality, shipped quickly. Love my item!  I have migraines caused by light, especially in the early morning when the sun rises. This mask blocks so much more light than other masks i have tried. It has helped prevent headaches every morning so far. It stays on without trouble and is actually comfortable to sleep in! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I was excited about this purchase, but upon wearing it the first time I found that it traps heat around your head and eyes causing sweat to build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first the silky feel was nice but it doesn&#x27;t breathe at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oversized mask was a nice idea, but ultimately the product fell short</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  It does its job well.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best sleep mask in the world.  I think the eye mask regular ones might work the same or very slightly better at keeping light out.  I do like the noise reduction. That is a big plus over the other styles of eye masks.  No others have this property.  No need for ear plugs, at least for light noises. It stays on my head while sleeping.  It is comfortable for sleeping and appears durable.  It packs easily. I recommend this product.  It does what it says.  It is a good alternative from the other sleep mask if you are looking for something different and are in need of light noise reduction.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift and the recipient loved it. Had tried others but did not measure up.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy another in the future. Highly recommend to others.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but I probably need to find a new solution because too much light comes in from the bottom.  Maybe all masks are like this, I don&#x27;t know.  It&#x27;s also pretty warm... in the summer it&#x27;s somewhat smothering.  It also tends to slip off my head easily.  I would normally wake up with it no longer on.  I think if I bought another one I&#x27;d get something that&#x27;s not so big, that mostly just goes over the eye area and is lighter.  I finally just gave up and bought black out curtains for my room (I work night shifts).</li>
