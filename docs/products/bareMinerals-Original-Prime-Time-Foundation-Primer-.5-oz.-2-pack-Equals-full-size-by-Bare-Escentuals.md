    <li> Regarding the color...there is no color, it is clear.  That wasn&#x27;t an option in the questions above.  Does it last all day?  hard to tell, since it&#x27;s under my foundation.  It does seem to make the foundation application smoother.</li>
    <li> best primer of all I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
