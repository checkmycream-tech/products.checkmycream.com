      <li>the price and nice smell</li>
      <li>so I need a nice conditioner to help me brush my hair.</li>
      <li>Just For Me Conditioner is a nice, effective product.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a nice coconut scent.  </li>
      <li>It works wonderfully too, and it&#x27;s done a great job of rehydration and conditioning mine and my daughter&#x27;s dry hair, but the smell is divine.</li>

      <li>Works great for the whole family!</li>
      <li>The scent is lightly sweet and pleasant without being overly strong.  </li>
      <li>but I LOVE the way this stuff smells.</li>
      <li>Love that.</li>
      <li>For some reason, using &amp;#34;hair milk&amp;#34; that is so creamy and white is a delightful experience.</li>
      <li>Okay, I&#x27;ll shut up now.</li>
      <li>to use dispenser at the top to control amount of conditioner used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I guess it could be, but I love using it myself.</li>
      <li>, becauseI really do love how this makes my hair look and feel on days when I straighten it, so it&#x27;s at times like that</li>
      <li>/&gt;Notice right off that it smells good, like coconuts.</li>
      <li>My hair was SO soft that I honestly just loved running my hands through it.</li>
      <li>The scent is very sweet</li>
      <li>more importantly it washes out well and does not grease up my hair</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m really surprised and quite happy that the product does what it says:</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant smell and it is a decent sized bottle for the price.</li>
      <li>Just For Me Conditioning hair milk Can be used after shampooing to moisturize, condition and make hair easy to manage by eliminating tangled hair.</li>
      <li>It did rinse easily from my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and is easy to wash out.</li>
      <li>It conditions just fine</li>
      <li>so I was glad that it quickly dissipated.</li>
      <li>For the price, and even twice the price -- it&#x27;s really a fantastic product.</li>
      <li>My hair comes out really smooth</li>
      <li>the great aesthetic pleasure is in the actual use.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is a light one which we prefer.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
      <li>My wife will continue to use this as her primary conditioner.</li>
      <li>This is a very nice conditioner overall.</li>
      <li>However, it lacks in producing any sort of significant shine or bounce.</li>
      <li>She loved the smell and look on the bottle , and actually wanted to use it.</li>
      <li>And I just need a dab the size of a half-dollar piece to get full</li>
      <li>if there was a bit of additional softness, there would also be increased poofyness and frizz, but most just never did all that much for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really wish Amazon would stop putting their stickers on top of the labels on these things.</li>
      <li>Hair feel very soft and smooth and it&#x27;s easy to comb.</li>
      <li>I can honestly say that, though I&#x27;ve tried a multitude of products - both high end and from the drugstore - that were supposed to make my hair feel silky, none of them ever really worked:</li>
      <li>but isn&#x27;t extraordinary or super softening in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cute for kids and completely usable for adults in a pinch.</li>
      <li>Even with more than the average amount of hair, I just need a quarter size blob of conditioner to effectively detangle my hair.  </li>
      <li>My daughter has tough hair some days and this product has been a wonderful addition to our routine.</li>
      <li>It smells good and it instantly makes your hair smooth and soft.  </li>
      <li>It is moderately fragranced, with a nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;All told, I&#x27;ll save this for &amp;</li>
      <li>It leaves hair soft, smooth and light, but not frizzy.</li>
      <li>Fixing hair has went from a fight to fun time.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The feel was soft and natural, the look was great, the fragrance was very nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So if I want to go with my hair&#x27;s natural texture and not worry about heat styling it, this just isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;ll be able to use on those days.  </li>
      <li>But I love how soft it makes my hair feel.</li>
      <li>and it slides right in</li>
      <li>I love this product, and I think it would work really well for others like me who have hair that&#x27;s on the unmanageable and problematic side, and who haven&#x27;t had luck finding a product that makes the hair super soft and silky.  </li>
      <li>It rinses out cleanly and without much effort.  </li>
      <li>, I wouldn&#x27;t think this would be a great product for those who have fine, thin hair.  </li>
      <li>Hair is soft, silky and easy to comb after use 4/5 stars</li>
      <li>good hair conditioner enriched with essential natural ingredients, butter, soymilk, and honey to works well to moisturize weather damaged hair for all family members.</li>
      <li>it moisturizes my hair, makes it very soft and smooth and</li>
      <li>very, very sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Based on packaging, I really thought this was a product for kids!</li>
      <li>When bushing my hair out afterwards, it was completely tangle free.  </li>
      <li>the experience is such a better one.</li>
      <li>exactly what we needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think this product may be better suited to a different hair type, it does not suit mine at all.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s going to take a few more weeks for me just using the one product to tell if I am having a reaction (these are usually mild not obvious reactions), but so far they seem pretty good.</li>
      <li>I can only imagine the effect it will have on fine hair</li>
      <li>So for all of those people, I very highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It left my hair feeling very smooth, shiny, and soft.</li>
      <li>The Just for Me conditioner really works and gets rid of tangles and is &amp;#34;no-tug,&amp;#34; as it claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t care much for the scent though</li>
      <li>but it isn&#x27;t stick straight</li>
      <li>this one really works well.</li>
      <li>I did not have to use much to get these effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The handful amount made my hair very manageable while blow drying.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really amazed with this product, as I am trying it out in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Wife absolutely loves it.  </li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t really say for myself but with a name like &amp;#34;Hair Milk Silkening&amp;#34; I just had to pour some on my head to see if it was...</li>
      <li>I can tell right off that it is going to leave my hair soft,</li>
      <li>Rinsing is easy -- not a lot of gloop and standing under the water for a long time to get out of you hair.  </li>
      <li>and it does keep my hair more tangle-free than other conditioners</li>
      <li>It takes longer to rinse out than most other conditioners.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just For Me Conditioning hair milk Can be used after shampooing to moisturize, condition and make hair easy to manage by eliminating tangled hair. Hair is soft, silky and easy to comb after use 4/5 stars</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product. My twin girls, 5-years-old, can&#x27;t deal with tangles after bath. The Just for Me conditioner really works and gets rid of tangles and is &amp;#34;no-tug,&amp;#34; as it claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This evening my wife bathed the twins and she said the Just For Me worked so well, she didn&#x27;t have to use the de-tangler and it was the easiest time she&#x27;s ever had at combing their hair. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still up in the air about this product, It definitely conditions well, but it seems to over condition my hair where I have too much product residue. I do like the way it looks after it is style and it lasts at least 3 days until hair is washed again. Again, it&#x27;s the residue I&#x27;m not liking.</li>
    <li> Works well enough to soften hair. It is light weight and has a pleasant fragrance. However, it lacks in producing any sort of significant shine or bounce. Packaging could use some pizzaz. Actually thought the product may have been designed for kids when I first got the bottle.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this conditioner and it does keep my hair more tangle-free than other conditioners but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth it&#x27;s current cost of $20. I also don&#x27;t like the name or the design, though those are things that don&#x27;t matter in the least. I&#x27;m just picturing the design team on this one, all wishing they were somewhere else on a Monday morning and throwing this together and thinking it will have to do. Unless this is a product that is marketed to young girls, which is entirely possible since young girls are probably the age group most likely to get tangles in their hair, though I&#x27;m 42 and the tangles seem to have only gotten worse. Okay, I&#x27;ll shut up now. It smells good and it works well on the tangles but it&#x27;s a little pricey.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this conditioner, and is very impressed.  It smells good and it instantly makes your hair smooth and soft.  It keeps hair moisturized without making it greasy.  My wife will continue to use this as her primary conditioner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really amazed with this product, as I am trying it out in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally the only Conditioner I use is Biolage Ultra Hydrating conditioning balm, as I have medium to fine hair and Biolage is the only conditioner I have ever used that seems to rinse clean and actually offer some moisturizing protection to my hair. Most conditioners weigh down my hair or make it greasy either right after I use it or by the end of the day my hair had collected enough grit to seem so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just for Me Hair Milk has shea butter, soymilk  which had me concerned about not rinsing out well and making my hair oily and honey. So I&#x27;m really surprised and quite happy that the product does what it says: it moisturizes my hair, makes it very soft and smooth and more importantly it washes out well and does not grease up my hair and I have been using this for a week now. And I just need a dab the size of a half-dollar piece to get full coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in fact very happy that I have found a new product that is every bit as good as the Biolage Hydrating balm.</li>
    <li> Generally conditioners make my hair &amp;#34;greasy.&amp;#34;  This product does not have that effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feel was soft and natural, the look was great, the fragrance was very nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, the hair was looking great and the hold still in place. I did not have to use much to get these effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only question is this, does the price justify the above?</li>
    <li> This Just For Me Hair Milk Silkening Conditioner is for all hair types.  It has shea butter, soymilk and honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice coconut scent.  Contrary to what the bottle says a comb did not glide right through my hair, rather with my very thick hair a comb only got halfway through my hair, but using a brush the brush did glide right through my hair without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do recommend that you do keep it on your hair 2-5 minutes before washing it out.  I left it on my hair at least 3 minutes.  It did rinse easily from my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It left my hair feeling very smooth, shiny, and soft.</li>
    <li> This is going to sound somewhat silly...but I LOVE the way this stuff smells. It works wonderfully too, and it&#x27;s done a great job of rehydration and conditioning mine and my daughter&#x27;s dry hair, but the smell is divine.</li>
    <li> So I wound up trying this product along with Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s Hair milk. They arrived within say a day apart so I&#x27;ve been rotating the use of these two for about three weeks now. Their both described as Hair Milk, but one of them has directions as a light cleanser or cleansing conditioner and the other as a conditioner after cleansing with some other product. This seems a bit like marketing spiel to me because they both seem to behave almost the same to me after actual use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No Carol&#x27;s Daughter has a longer list of things the products does not contain, like sulfates than Just for Me does. I really wish Amazon would stop putting their stickers on top of the labels on these things. I couldn&#x27;t read the rest of the ingredients list from the bottle because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes down to it, I am a bi-racial woman on constant look out for products that will work for me. I don&#x27;t typically have sensitive skin, but I have a very sensitive scalp and hair that has a tendency to break. I find a lot of natural hair products don&#x27;t work well for me because of reactions to my scalp and the other stuff is often worse or too strong. It&#x27;s going to take a few more weeks for me just using the one product to tell if I am having a reaction (these are usually mild not obvious reactions), but so far they seem pretty good. My hair is soft with the use, as promised, but not affect doesn&#x27;t last as long as say some of the KeraCare products I use. I say that as a person who can&#x27;t wash her hair every day; i just can&#x27;t. I also live in a dry heat in the summer area, for reference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I want is soft manageable hair that lasts for a few days in somewhat harsh conditions. This product is performing about as well as the other hair milk in that regard, although I am not sure well enough for me to switch to it.</li>
    <li> This conditioner worked exceptionally well. Our young daughter has wavy hair which tends to tangle a lot, and this conditioner really worked.  She loved the smell and look on the bottle , and actually wanted to use it. Normally she fights against putting hair products in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair got really shiny and silky, and it made a dramatic difference in removing tangles, which is always the hardest part of shampooing and drying her hair. Compared to other &amp;#34;rich&amp;#34; conditioners this one did not give a heavy, oily feeling after drying. My wife has noticed that some conditioners make her hair get dirty faster, but not this conditioner. It leaves hair soft, smooth and light, but not frizzy. The consistency is just right, not too thick or runny, and applies to the hair evenly. Works great for the whole family! Very pleased!</li>
    <li> My seven year old daughter really likes this conditioner, probably for the smell alone. As a conditioner, it works no better or worse than your standard conditioner (around the quality of, say, Suave) so you can figure out for yourself if it&#x27;s worth the price point. It conditions just fine but isn&#x27;t extraordinary or super softening in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cute for kids and completely usable for adults in a pinch.</li>
    <li> Based on packaging, I really thought this was a product for kids! I guess it could be, but I love using it myself. The scent is very sweet and I really love the almond smell it leaves behind in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture itself is a little pasty but make no mistake because it literally glides through your hair. I normally flat iron my hair for days that I&#x27;m working and with this I didn&#x27;t feel the need to. My hair was SO soft that I honestly just loved running my hands through it. I&#x27;m really pleased with the results!</li>
    <li> Our daughter&#x27;s hair is thick and naturally curly, C3 on top and 4A in the back -- and we have over a dozen products for her hair that I continue to try and to find the right product, that isn&#x27;t too greasy or heavy, smells horrible, or absorb so fast that her hair looks fuzzy and dry within an hour after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when we got this Just for Me Hair Milk conditioner from Vine last week, I decided to try it as a leave in after her shower, and while one of the least expensive we&#x27;ve tried, it&#x27;s has had the best results on her hair! I am using it every morning now, in a spray bottle mixed with 2 parts water, one part Hair Milk. It even smells fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also a great detangler for natural hair, and as a leave in conditioner on wet natural, bi-racial, curly hair, brushed through with a Wet Brush or Tangle Teeze brushes, styled naturally, it has given us shiny, soft, loose curls! For the price, and even twice the price -- it&#x27;s really a fantastic product. Love it!</li>
    <li> Just For Me Conditioner Hair Milk Silkening is a great conditioner. I&#x27;m kind of impatient and don&#x27;t leave it in as long as suggested, but I use it daily. My hair comes out really smooth and I&#x27;m often not using any styling product after using it. I seem not to need any. I found the packaging a little odd until I realized that it is marketed towards children.</li>
    <li> As someone with curly hair who washes my hair usually every 3 days (sometimes 4), it&#x27;s important to me how my hair looks over several days. On subsequent days I&#x27;ll either tie up my hair before my shower (getting my hair damp but not wet), or &amp;#34;rinse&amp;#34; without shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner was absolutely fantastic on Day One -- my curly hair fell in gorgeous waves. But on subsequent days, my hair flattened out more than usual, with a somewhat &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; texture that made me think it hadn&#x27;t rinsed out completely, and this happened both times I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;But the great aesthetic pleasure is in the actual use. For some reason, using &amp;#34;hair milk&amp;#34; that is so creamy and white is a delightful experience. It is moderately fragranced, with a nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;All told, I&#x27;ll save this for &amp;#34;day of&amp;#34; conditioning, when I want my hair to look its best for a special occasion.</li>
    <li> This product was good, but it didn&#x27;t detangle the way I hoped it would. It did leave my hair soft and smells great!</li>
    <li> I know some people look at 5 star Vine reviews and automatically think they&#x27;re fake, but I only rave about something when I truly enjoy it or it works well for me, as is the case with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is long, really thick and coarse, naturally curly/wurly, and dry with a fair amount of damage.  I can honestly say that, though I&#x27;ve tried a multitude of products - both high end and from the drugstore - that were supposed to make my hair feel silky, none of them ever really worked: if there was a bit of additional softness, there would also be increased poofyness and frizz, but most just never did all that much for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product?  Delivered.  I&#x27;ve used it a few times now, and my hair afterwards has been the softest and silkiest (with a lot of shine) that it&#x27;s ever been when it&#x27;s straightened.  It also cuts down on the visibility of the coarseness and the areas that are dry to a great extent (though not completely), and it tamps down the poofyness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a thick conditioner/hair milk by any means, so I do have to use a fair amount - at least a half dollar size dollop initially, and then I usually have to go back and add a bit more - just to feel like it&#x27;s coated all of my hair from about the mid-shaft downward (if it gets on the scalp, it totally does away with volume). The smell is very tropical, and the shea butter fragrance is pretty strong, but not in a bad way if one likes like that aroma, and it does dissipate somewhat once the hair is dried.  It rinses out cleanly and without much effort.  It doesn&#x27;t totally get rid of all of my tangles when it&#x27;s wet and then partly damp, but after it&#x27;s totally dry, my brush glides right through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have an issue with this product: it really does weigh down my curls and waves.  A lot.  So if I want to go with my hair&#x27;s natural texture and not worry about heat styling it, this just isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;ll be able to use on those days.  That&#x27;s not a deal-breaker for me, becauseI really do love how this makes my hair look and feel on days when I straighten it, so it&#x27;s at times like that when I&#x27;ll be reaching for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the above in mind, as well as how the product really tamps down on poofyness (and frizz), I wouldn&#x27;t think this would be a great product for those who have fine, thin hair.  Given how this weighs down mine, I can imagine that people with those hair types would be left with hair that&#x27;s totally flat and volume-less, so if that&#x27;s not a look you&#x27;re going for, you might be want to be cautious with this, or at least use it very, very sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I don&#x27;t give 5 star reviews lightly, and I hardly ever deem something a Holy Grail kind of product, but this hair milk definitely falls into that category when I want to wear my thick, coarse hair straight.  I love this product, and I think it would work really well for others like me who have hair that&#x27;s on the unmanageable and problematic side, and who haven&#x27;t had luck finding a product that makes the hair super soft and silky.  So for all of those people, I very highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> thick and rich smells like coconuts.  Works just like normal conditioner. But I love how soft it makes my hair feel. I have permed and color treated hair so I need a nice conditioner to help me brush my hair. this one really works well. highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Just for Me Conditioner Hair Milk Silkening is a wonderful product. My daughter has tough hair some days and this product has been a wonderful addition to our routine. Fixing hair has went from a fight to fun time.</li>
    <li> My daughter has curly hair and this conditioner seems to really help it not be so dried out. It has a pleasant smell and it is a decent sized bottle for the price.</li>
    <li> My daughter used to hate hair washing, and hair combing but since using a couple of Just for Me products (including this one) the experience is such a better one. This conditioner seems to envelop every strand (granted I use a lot of it!) and is easy to wash out. Hair feel very soft and smooth and it&#x27;s easy to comb. The fragrance is a light one which we prefer.</li>
    <li> My family enjoys the outdoors so our hair tend to dry out and become brittle.  This &amp;#34;Just for Me Hair Milk&amp;#34; conditioner was exactly what we needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes:&lt;br /&gt;*Enriched with nutrients: shea butter, soymilk, and honey to soften and moisturize hair.&lt;br /&gt;*Easy to use dispenser at the top to control amount of conditioner used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work?&lt;br /&gt;*After one week&#x27;s use (following the instructions carefully by leaving the conditioner on our hair for 2-5 minutes after shampooing), my family&#x27;s hair were noticeably softer, more manageable, and shinier.&lt;br /&gt;*We were careful not to use too much conditioner so our hair rinsed out cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slight Concerns:&lt;br /&gt;*The conditioner has a nice butter, milk, and honey scent that&#x27;s OK with all of our family members but some folks may find the scent resembling ladies hand lotions.&lt;br /&gt;*Be careful not to use too much because this conditioner is a bit harder to rinse out thoroughly due to the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;A good hair conditioner enriched with essential natural ingredients, butter, soymilk, and honey to works well to moisturize weather damaged hair for all family members.</li>
    <li> My hair is thick, curly, tends to be dry and frizzy. This product did nothing for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is thick and creamy with a light scent. I didn&#x27;t care much for the scent though so I was glad that it quickly dissipated. I do like that it&#x27;s enriched with butter, soymilk and honey, but those natural ingredients make up a very small percentage of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After repeated uses, my hair did not get any softer, less tangled or less frizzy. It takes longer to rinse out than most other conditioners. It has to be left on for 2-5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that how well hair products work depends on hair type. I think this product may be better suited to a different hair type, it does not suit mine at all.</li>
    <li> Two reviews for the price of one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert: Very thick, but flows very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strong smell of coconut which did not persist after being rinsed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is pretty stiff with lots of different directions and tangles easily even where it is less  than an inch long. Soft and fluffy afterwards, and kept that feel for three days in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good lady friend&#x27;s opinion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;This conditioner was absolutely amazing!  It is light and fluffy and has just the right texture.  It went through my hair perfectly and rinsed out with ease.  As an added bonus – it smells like a combination of both the beach and shea butter.  When bushing my hair out afterwards, it was completely tangle free.  I also felt that my hair seemed straighter and less frizzy after blow drying.  I am the newest fan of this product line now!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert C. Ross&lt;br /&gt;June 2015</li>
    <li> Just for Me Conditioner Hair Milk is the bomb.  I have naturally wavy hair -- it&#x27;s not curly but it isn&#x27;t stick straight so therefore I become a humidity victim quite easily.  Just for Me Hair Milk conditioner tones this down tremendously and for that alone I will buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is silky smooth going into your hair and a small amount goes a long way.  I tried this product two ways; first I used a handful and left in my hair while I finished my shower and then rinsed.  Rinsing is easy -- not a lot of gloop and standing under the water for a long time to get out of you hair.  The handful amount made my hair very manageable while blow drying.  I then used less than a handful and basically got the same results so sometimes smaller is better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price and nice smell, I would try this product.  I can only imagine the effect it will have on fine hair -- my experience with it was that it was perfect as a detangler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natalie S. for Amazon Vine</li>
    <li> Just for me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notice right off that it smells good, like coconuts. you cannot go wrong with that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its thick, and coats my hair nicely. I can tell right off that it is going to leave my hair soft, many years of bad conditioner and I can tell just by how when I massage it in, that its doing its job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinses out well, and did not leave my hair feeling heavy. NOW here is the test, run a brush through..and it slides right in and I can brush it immediately. Love that. After a few days using it, my hair feels softer and silkier as promised!</li>
    <li> Wife absolutely loves it.  Just For Me Conditioner Hair Milk Silening is one of the best conditioners she says she&#x27;s ever used.  I don&#x27;t have any hair so I can&#x27;t really say for myself but with a name like &amp;#34;Hair Milk Silkening&amp;#34; I just had to pour some on my head to see if it was... I dunno... like milk or something.  It wasn&#x27;t but I suppose if I had hair it would have conditioned it... milkingly.</li>
    <li> Just For Me Conditioner is a nice, effective product.  I have long hair that&#x27;s fine, but also very thick -- so I have a lot of hair.  This product seems to be geared toward kids, but it works well with my hair.  My hair is very easy to comb out after using this product, even after a day at the beach or out in the wind, activities that really make my hair knotty and difficult to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is quite thick and rich.  A little goes a long way.  Even with more than the average amount of hair, I just need a quarter size blob of conditioner to effectively detangle my hair.  The scent is lightly sweet and pleasant without being overly strong.  It definitely leaves my hair very soft and silky feeling without weighing it down.  This is a very nice conditioner overall.</li>
