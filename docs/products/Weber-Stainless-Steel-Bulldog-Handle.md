<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my second purchase of a Weber product.  They are well-made razors and handles.  The stainless steel is perfectly cut and polished.  This handle has substantial heft and great balance, the knurling provides excellent grip.  This handle was purchased for my Edwin Jagger razor head, and the threads fit perfectly.  This handle has improved the performance of the EJ razor, which is now my favorite shaver.</li>
    <li> This is a heavy handle that really helps get that close shave. I prefer an open comb safety razor and the Bulldog is a great compliment. The knurling is very nice too, your slippery fingers won&#x27;t lose any grip on this handle. Worth it if you want a great shave experience.</li>
    <li> I ordered this handle to use with the head of my Muehlle R41.  I was blown away when I opened the package.  The weight of the handle is perfect and the craftsmanship is excellent.  If you have a razor you enjoy and would like to upgrade or add to the pleasure of shaving, this is that missing link,  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome, I looked at several before purchasing this one. The knurling makes for a really sure grip.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite razor handles and I have many, some even costing double the Weber Bulldog handle.</li>
    <li> Great product thank you will buy again</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift ... but only because I have one myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If ever there was a five star product, this is it.  It will take a good shaving experience and make it even better.</li>
    <li> I hesitated to get a Weber Bulldog handle for a while because of the price but I finally bit the bullet.  When it arrived, I couldn’t have been happier.  The construction is near flawless.  It has a ton of weight for a small handle yet it is perfectly balanced throughout.  The top half of the handle is lighter but has just the right amount of weight from the bottom half to let the razor do all the work.  The knurling is insanely good and provides an excellent non-slip grip with every shave.  Even the threading is exceptional and has never given me any problems when switching between three piece razor heads.  It also instantly transforms any three piece razor into one bad-ass piece of hardware!  Yes, this handle is a bit pricy for what it is.  However, if you’re passionate about wet shaving and you’re a stickler for details, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> This was a kick ass up grade for my razor, I replaced my Merkur 180 long handle with this, it was a fast and easy install well worth the price, the weight is solid and I love the deep knurling pattern.</li>
    <li> I used a EJ89 with the slick handle for some time and found it to be slippery. I&#x27;m a face latherer and would often get soap on my hands, and found it to be a pain to have to rinse my hands after every lather pass. I bought this handle specifically for the knurling, but I have grown to appreciate it&#x27;s other qualities the more I use it. I like that it is a high quality metal, meaning that it has a better chance to last a long time. I also really like the weight and have found that it helps me better control my blade pressure. Lastly, it just feels better. This could be because it&#x27;s a little wider than the EJ89 handle, but it fits my hand incredibly well.</li>
    <li> Get 1. The Weber Bulldog Handle provides perfect weight and grip; combine it with a with a Matador &amp;#34;aggressive head&amp;#34; and you will enjoy a BBS shave. The craftsmanship on Weber handle is excellent.</li>
    <li> I use the Weber Bulldog handle on my Merkur 23C razor and must say it really has improved that razor.  It has better balance, better grip, and improved handling.  The 23C with the Weber handle has found a place in my regular rotation.</li>
    <li> The &#x27;Weber Bulldog&#x27; is more like an American Pit-Bull of the shaving handle industry! There&#x27;s some serious weight to this handle, which greatly aids to getting a good shave. I purchased the complete Weber Bulldog razor, yet I can also comment on how this affects the look and feel combining it with another shave head, e.g. my Merkur 180. The chromed-brass Merkur handle, @ 7/8\\&quot; longer than this Bulldog 3\\&quot; handle, feels much lighter. I tried the same DE blade I&#x27;ve been using in the Merkur head, yet I&#x27;m still finding the shorter handle, wider girth, overall heavier weight, deeply machine-turned checkering/knurling, do a better job shaving. I use less pressure with the Bulldog attached, taking just two passes for a close shave instead of my typical 4-pass approach. I can tell you with absolute certainty that adding this handle to the Merkur head really does make a big difference! I&#x27;m 6&#x27;1\\&quot;, @ 217lbs, having a hand spread of 9\\&quot; tip of thumb to pinky, yet this short handle fits me perfectly.medy this I first tried rinsing it out with warm running water, then took a toothpick with a drop of liquid soap (soap suds help loosen and pick out leftover material) on the tip and while under running water began to pick out remnants of the tapping process (quite a few too, I&#x27;ll add). Once all the machined material was removed an inspection of the threads revealed they were perfectly cut and sharp, not messed up in the least but perfectly cut. Once cleaned I&#x27;d found that head-screws/ threaded posts thread into the handle flawlessly, without any resistance. Just be sure to wear safety glasses or be very careful whilst picking out any leftover machined material, so as not to get sharp metal fragments in the eyes, you should be good to go. Having to pick out a few machining remnants is to me a teeny-tiny price to pay considering I got a beautiful, useful, well-machined (not a cheap investment-cast) tool that greatly adds to my shaving experience, one that&#x27;s made in the USA by American machinists! Thanks for your feedback, +1 your way, as it helped me remember/ find what as a master machinist I should have looked for from personal past experiences. I hope this helps you too.&lt;br /&gt;PPS: As a machinist and a Master Gunsmith myself, take my word when I say that a well-machined, USA-made handle such as this, one made from quality stainless steel as these are made, is well worth the price asked. To me, at least, it was worth every penny I&#x27;d paid, compare to the competitors cost especially. Just my opinion, at least, for what it&#x27;s worth, even though money&#x27;s tight for me too I&#x27;d pay it again in a heartbeat could I afford to. NOTE: I&#x27;m not affiliated with Weber Razor in any way, just a VERY satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> It is a well machined solid handle with some decent weight and a nice wide diameter. I have psoriatic arthritis and the smaller handles  traditionally found on the classic Gillette three piece razors were causing me hand issues. I didn&#x27;t want to give up on my favorite open comb razors so I tried a Weber handle. I liked it so well I bought another, as well as the whole razor. Its a pleasure to use!</li>
    <li> As my first DE razor, I got the gorgeous Edwin Jagger DE89. Great razor, just about perfect for a first DE razor, and in the smooth chrome finish, not nearly as slippery as I had feared. But, with soapy hands it can get a little hard to control. Enter the Weber Bulldog handle: Deep barley finish, more weight, stainless steel, substantial, and just about perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DE89 head with the Weber Bulldog handle is essentially shaving perfection. Pair this set up with a Feather or Polsilver blade and it&#x27;s hard to ask for better.</li>
    <li> I received my handle today. I&#x27;m using it on my R41. The Weber bulldog brings my razor back to life. A perfect grip, look and weight! Get one today.</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t gotten one and if you use a double edge razor... well this is the handle to upgrade your machine! I&#x27;ve used mine for a year now (perhaps a bit more) and won&#x27;t go back to the shiny (and slippery) handle on my original razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grip is MUCH safer when your hands get soapy (about 12 seconds into a shave) and the extra weight should help with your control of shave - important if you prefer not to bleed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it - you won&#x27;t regret your purchase.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality!  Exactly what I was looking forward. Substantial weight and good knurling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving with a traditional safety razor, brush, soap or cream for the last 8 years.  This has been one pleasant addition to my kit. I have quite a few antique Gillette three piece techs, as well as a few newer three piece safety razors that use a similar gauge handle. The weight and grip of this handle helps to transform these mild razors to tools that cut whiskers like a hot knife through butter, without the need to push down on the razor to achieve a close shave.  On top of that, this handle is built like a tank, so there is little chance of breaking or denting it. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Hello Barb et al,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Weber Razor arrived today, amazing delivery considering weather etc., and it is not only built from obviously high grade materials but it is attractive AND IT&#x27;S A VERY EFFICIENT SHAVING TOOL!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I tried it out using a Dorco stainless blade that I had already used for 8 shaves!!!  It used that blade almost as effectively as if it were new.  No pulling, tugging, nicks, scrapes or irritation whatsoever!!!!!  I really anticipated, from the reviews, that using a worn blade like that would have been a trial by ordeal for an aggressive razor.  Simply not the case, your Weber is not all that aggressive.  I&#x27;ve been shaving with DE razors off and on for over 60 years and this razor is terrific ... it \\&quot;talks\\&quot; during the shave but it&#x27;s forgiving!!!  I suppose in the hands of a complete novice caution would be in order but I shaved AGAINST THE GRAIN with that old blade and the razor did nothing harmful to me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, thank you for sending me this beautiful razor ... I will pass it on to my son and he to his, this instrument will never wear out from routine use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note regarding how I use the razor.  I only finger tighten the handle, no twisting, no force ... the angle on the blade with this pressure is perfect!  I use Barbarsol shaving cream, no gels, as it clears the razor quickly by passing it under some lightly running warm water.  I have a moderately heavy growth and only warm my face for a moment by passing my hand under warm running water and slighting warming my face.  This Weber razor does not, in my view, require any special preparatory rituals in order to do an absolutely outstanding job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try and post this on the website as a \\&quot;review\\&quot; if I&#x27;m able to find the right place to do this.  I may have to go to Amazon and try to post it where the handle is advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a very Merry Christmas!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  We ordered the entire razor, not just the handle, from the Weberweb site ............. it&#x27;s on Google!!!  Email \\&quot;Barb\\&quot; at the email address posted there and you will be amazed at the courteous attention still available to customers from an American company located in Missouri.  Their price right now is $70.00, which is less than half the cost of a all stainless Feather,  and the quality may be even better because of the marine/surgical quality of the steel being used!!!  My wife and I are obviously pleased with the product and the razor is a absolute shaving machine!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I must say this is an excellent handle. I will not get into a 5 page review but this handle is perfect.  I recently purchased a Premax (Fatip) Razor and read that everybody recommends switching the handle out. Well, this one fits and it is a perfect match. The Knurling on it is excellent and ensures a proper grip along with the \\&quot;Frankenrazor\\&quot; being perfectly balanced.</li>
    <li> I had a well-worn 1930s Gillette NEW handed down to me from my dad, which he probably got from his dad. After a recent nickel replate, the razor looked great, but the handle and head would no longer mate properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading lots of great reviews here, I decided to get the Weber Handle.  Build quality is great, knurling is great, and has just the right amount of substantial heft that was lacking in the original NEW handle.  Fit my replated NEW head like a glove and is now my favorite daily shaver. The knurling makes it virtually impossible to drop, regardless of how soapy your hands are, and I am in an out in a couple of minutes with a pressureless blade-buffed shave.  I have tried it with an R41 and an EJ89 head and it works great with these as well, but with the NEW, it is out-of-this-world outstanding. Oh, did I mention the razor itself now looks like it belongs in an industrial design museum? Get one, it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Great handle with plenty of weight</li>
    <li> This handle is shorter than I expected but turns out to be perfect for me. Nice weight and feel. As always on time delivery of exactly what ordered.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for about 7 months now and I love my Edwin Jagger razors. I used to nick my self quite a bit and thought it was just my technique. Well if it was this handle changed it for the better. Now it is only once and a while. This handles weight and length changed the ballance for the better. At least for me. It really makes it feel like I&#x27;m holding a real tool in my hand and it looks good too. Its the coolest razor I own and I own more than a few. It shaves the best as well. Now to wait for the Weber razors to come back in stock.</li>
    <li> Very heavy. Excellent grip. Much better than the original handle to my EJ 89l.  Now shaves like a different razor.</li>
    <li> This is a piece of true industrial art. The weight and heft of it really balances my razor head. I&#x27;m using it to replace the handle on my Muhle R89 razor. Really great grip on it (no slipping here!) and it looks like something from the museum of science and industry. It is &amp;#34;retro&amp;#34; in the sense that it recalls a time when things were made as well as they could be, not designed to be replaced eventually. This will last forever.</li>
    <li> I used the Bulldog handle with my EJ DE8911 razor.  The original handle with this razor was smooth sided.  It was difficult to grip with hands slippery from shaving soap.  The Bulldog handle definitely solved that problem!</li>
    <li> This handle is a great addition to the DE89 head.  The EJ handle seemed to slip a little in my fingers whereas this has a very good grip. The added weight also makes it a much nicer razor</li>
    <li> Outstanding quality at a great price.</li>
    <li> I ordered the bulldog handle with their own stainless steel head on their own site-- it was weberrazor &amp;#34;hosted by Amazon&amp;#34; , or something to that effect. I don&#x27;t like the razor at all (I have 4 othe DE razors, 3 of which are Merkurs).  The handle has good weight but the finish is, to put it politely,  industrial, and the shave is nasty ( tried it with several blades).&lt;br /&gt;Funny thing is-- the site has EVERYONE 5 staring it. My review never appeared. That&#x27;s one way to keep your average up! LOL.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re ordering this handle to use with another head, you&#x27;ll be ok except for the contrast between your high end head and this &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This aftermarket handle significantly upgrades the EJ89 razor, making it pretty much foolproof against dropping while using slippery tallow-based soaps. In hindsight, I could have saved some coin by just buying a knurled handle razor from the get-go, but the hybrid EJ/Weber tool works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Never realized how this extra weight would help but it sure makes a difference. Great product and I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love weber razors and their handles.  For the money you cannot do better.  I would like to see an open comb or slant.</li>
    <li> Wonderful weight, impeccable quality, and outstanding grip. Great purchase that will last many life times. I put mine on a Edwin Jagger DE89 head.</li>
    <li> I love my EJ 89, but the handle that comes with it is smooth and hard to securely hold unless I dry my hand. Fit and finish of the Weber is first class with plenty of knurling everywhere it needs to be.This handle screwed on my EJ 89 head with no drama and made my shave very precise. It was easy to hold the proper angle and the weight serves to provide a close shave without my having to press the razor into my skin. This handle also fits many other shaving heads if I decide to try others without having to buy complete razors. Makes a great DE razor even better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using an edwin jagger DE89 and wanted to increase performance. The added heft of the handle makes a significant improvement in shaves. A DFS comes much easier than before.&lt;br /&gt;Stainless steel and slightly larger diameter add noticable weight AND improves balance for a significantly better, more controlled shave.&lt;br /&gt;The knurled texture is awesome. The transition between knurled and smooth is phenomenal, and feels good in the hand. The threads are superior to the standard Merkur and EJ handles.&lt;br /&gt;Merkur and EJ offer wonderful products. However the difference between pot metal with chrome plating vs stainless steel is night and day.  I should have bought this handle a year ago, when I started using DE razors.&lt;br /&gt;I am now looking forward to purchasing an Ikon head or razor to realize the added performance, fit and finish of the entire razor, although the EJ works superbly.&lt;br /&gt;My fisrt shave was with a personna, TOBS sandalwood soap, followed up with whichazel, 444 mentholated aftershave balm and a couple blasts of Pen&#x27;s BB.&lt;br /&gt;Zero irritation, or burn.&lt;br /&gt;If you have an EJ razor, its well worth dropping the 40-50 dollars for this handle.&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this handle on my merkur open comb 25C with the same improved performance. I still prefer the EJ much more than the 25C. I think the additional weight adds smoothness to my shaves. I can even get a smooth \\&quot;ish\\&quot; shave using Derby blades, which I find intolerable. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, derby&#x27;s will never be part of my kit. They&#x27;re a \\&quot;4\\&quot; out of 10 rather than a Zero.&lt;br /&gt;I have recently revisited lathering technique and bought tabac soap. Both have provided leaps forward and have dramtically improved results.  But this handle is still the best of all incremental improvements and purchases one can do to obtain a better result.</li>
    <li> I purchased this handle to replace the smooth chrome one that came with my Edwin Jabber DE89BL. Even though I do enjoy this razor, the lack of knurling on the handle had me worried that I would lose grip and control of the razor when shaving. I&#x27;m glad to report the deep knurling on this handle entirely solves the slickness issue of the stock handle. I have confidence and a strong grip, even with my fingers soaked in soapy water. Fit and finish is fantastic as you would expect from a handle in this price range. The weight is just perfect--quite a bit heavier than the stock handle, giving it a more substantial feeling in the hand. The only downside here is the price, and though the finish is exceptional, I did note some light metal &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; shavings on the handle when I first removed it from the box. Certainly from the machining process. Just be sure to give it a good rinse with soapy water before first use.</li>
    <li> This Weber Bulldog handle is a big, beefy, weighty addition to just about any &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; 3 piece razor out there. It will fit on virtually any vintage Gillette 3 piece head.guard combination as well as mosy any other classic style DE razor made today. Excellent value for a stainless steel handle.</li>
    <li> Better fit (tighter) than original handle. Ultimate shave with DE89 Jagger Head screw. Look to last longer than a lifetime. Super comfortable</li>
    <li> Best safety razor handle I own. Used this now with many razor heads. Thumbs up !</li>
    <li> I needed a heavier quality handle for my Muhle R41 razor.  The razor came with a nice enough handle, but was on the light side for my tastes.  The razor had a habit of skipping when I did XTG passes on my neck.  The Weber was the perfect solution.  The extra weight helped me have better control of the razor.  Anyone familar with this razor knows that you want all the control you can get.  The Weber is a piece of art in the hand.  The knurling is perfect for a non-slip hold, the handle is beautifully polished and the weight is well thought out. This made for a nicely balanced razor.  On top of all this, Weber really hustles on shipping out their products.  I am very satisfied with this handle.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT. APPEARS IDENTICAL TO THE IKON BULLDOG HANDLE. IT IS STAINLESS STEEL (NO RUST) SHINY, HEAVY (PROVIDES BALANCED) AND HAS DEEP KNURLING FOR GOOD GRIPPING.</li>
    <li> Purchased this handle to replace the handle on my Edwin Jagger [[ASIN:B002RBF1PO Edwin Jagger De89lbl Double Edge Safety Razor Chrome Plated Lined Detail, Chrome]].  I felt the Jagger handle, though extremely beautiful, was too slippery and lighter in weight when compared to the Jagger head.  I wanted to improve the control and the balance.  Success!  This is a beauty, American made, looks awesome with the Jagger head and I could not be happier.</li>
    <li> Weber!  You&#x27;re the type of company that most men wish they had started!  Thank you for such a great handle. It has changed the way that I approach shaving. I have an EJ DB89 and I love the head on that thing it give a great shave. But their stock handle is worse than a bar of soap when you&#x27;re hands are wet. There is no knurling on the handle so you have ZERO control over where the blade is going. Let&#x27;s just say that if I kept my hands dry and the handle dry then the shave was perfect. How annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I checked on the forums and everyone pointed to you and I thought: &amp;#34;38 bucks is a lot for a chunk of metal&amp;#34;. But bought it anyway and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with having spent the money. You&#x27;ve made my daily ritual a mediation rather than a pile of anxiety. I don&#x27;t have to leave the house with toilet paper stuck to my face anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EJ should send you a fruit you guys basket!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey guys if you&#x27;re on the fence about this handle just skip the coffees out this month. It&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
    <li> This handle is fantastic, right length, right weight, not slippery, nicely done</li>
    <li> When I read about the Bulldog Handle, I could not see where it would make much difference in the weight and feel of my EJ DE89 razor. I was hesitant to spend that much for just a handle. I received a gift certificate and decided to treat myself and give it a try. Boy, was I wrong. The heavy handle gives the razor a completely different feel. It seems to really help in not applying too much pressure, which relates to less nicks and scrapes. I was torn in trying the handle out because the handle that comes on the DE89 is beautiful and seems rather heavy itself. I&#x27;m glad I did....my only problem now is that I don&#x27;t use the original handle anymore since getting the Bulldog. Another plus of the Bulldog is that it is easy to grip with wet soapy hands. Bottom line is I love the Bulldog Handle. It is not as pretty as the original handle, but seems to work much better.</li>
    <li> This handle is awesome. Feels hefty in hand, has great grip and nice balance with my razor heads. I should have bought one sooner. This has greatly improved my shaves!</li>
    <li> This is a nice solid handle. I put it on my Edwin Jagger razor and it makes a perfectly balanced razor. It makes any 3 piece razor a real mans razor. You won&#x27;t be sorry if you get this.</li>
    <li> Good product . More than I expected nice texture. No chance of this slipping out of hand. I use this on my edwin jagger de 89lbl.  it has made my  E J de 89lb l a better razor .</li>
    <li> Outstanding quality. Made in the U.S. Will definitely outlast me!</li>
    <li> I have used the Weber Bulldog handle with all my razors and it is the best handle to use for any three piece DE razor. It&#x27;s added weight and shorter length give the razor that you use with it the perfect balance for shaving.</li>
    <li> I started DE shaving a couple of years ago when my son gave me a Edwin Jagger DE razor.  I liked the razor but found that it was a tad slippery and felt a bit light.  The chrome finish was nice but I wanted something else.  The hunt was on for something with a grippier handle and a bit more heft.  After perusing some shave forums I found this Weber.  Great grippy handle and made of solid stainless steel unlike the EJ which I believe is brass and then chromed.  I didn&#x27;t want just the handle, I wanted the whole shebang!  So I ordered the handle with the Weber head ($70).  I couldn&#x27;t believe it when it arrived in just 2 days.  No, not Prime just lucky that I live in Savannah and it was shipped from Brunswick GA.  This is just a piece of art!  Workmanship is top notch.  The hatching on the handle is just perfect, the weight is substantial.  I&#x27;ve found head seems to be a bit more aggressive than the EJ which is ok with me.  I&#x27;m using Feather blades and boy one swipe and no need to go back.  This razor is just a great piece of kit.  Don&#x27;t just get the handle, get the head too.  Ok, I&#x27;m not an expert but I highly recommend this razor.  My search has stopped.  Cheers</li>
    <li> I bought this handle to use on my Gillette Tech Travel Safety Razor. It fit&#x27;s just fine and gives a nice strong balance to the razor . I love the weight that it has in it . You know that you got something in your hand with this. It is just the perfect length and right knurling to help keep a grip on it. Nice Item . Thank&#x27;s</li>
    <li> This handle is outstanding in every way. Great weight, texture, and balance. The finish is beautiful. Everything about it screams \\&quot;Quality.\\&quot; I have been using safety razors for about 40 years, and have nearly 50 of them in my collection. I paired this handle with a pre-1950s Gillette Tech head. Amazing combination, they look and feel like they were made for each other. For the past 5 years or so, the Merkur Futur has been my favorite \\&quot;Go To\\&quot; razor. This one has quickly nudged it out of the top spot.</li>
    <li> Criss-cross knurling patter provides a strong grip. A marked improved over the factory lined handle of my Edwin Jagger. I really dislike the slipperiness of some handles because I feel like they will drop from my hand and don&#x27;t provide good control. The Weber bulldog handle provides solid control. If you are comparing this to the iKon, the knurling is slightly deeper on the Weber handles. The Weber is also made in the USA.  This handle has a bit of heft, so you may need to get re-acquainted with your razor after you install it. The Weber bulldog handle weights about 2.2 oz. For comparison sake, the Edwin Jagger lined handle weights about 1.6 oz. That means the Weber bulldog is almost 40% heavier than the Edwin Jagger lined handle! Don&#x27;t let this scare you though, the balance is still great and I find the weight helps with shaving.  The handle has a very high quality tool feel and has the look of polished steel. Fit and finish are excellent, no burs or tool marks. I&#x27;ve had it for awhile now and the stainless steel has held up well and shows no sign of corrosion. This handle looks and feels like it can last forever. ------- Update: I just tried this handle on an Ikon #102 slant head and wow what a great combo. The weight, balance, and grip is perfect for me. When I bought the Ikon #102 it came with Ikon&#x27;s Tuckaway &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; handle which was a bit small for my taste and less grippy. I tried to like the Tuckaway handle but it just wasn&#x27;t for me. In Ikon&#x27;s defense their handles are finished very nicely and smoothed out so it looks stunning, but this cause it to lose some grip.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. No slip - could be a little longer, but oveerall - completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> Its smaller than Ikon, but it is from the best steel and offers great grip and weight. Best product ever!!!</li>
    <li> Put this handle on a Edwin Jagger DE87 head.  No more slippery handle!  Without a doubt the number one razor in my rotation now.  Great finish, great fit, and great feel.  Would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Good quality fits what it says merkur and muhle. Threads felt a little messed up deeper in the handle but if you just crank it on the first time it works fine after that. Not sure if something so simple is worth so much though!</li>
    <li> First let me say I agree with J.T. Shepherd&#x27;s fine review except to me the Weber BullDog is MUCH nicer looking than the EJ89 handle as well as being MUCH more user friendly than any other handle I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been \\&quot;traditional wet shaving\\&quot; for about two years now. I was given the EJ89 by a friend when I first started, so I used it and found the shave head very nice,but the handle WAY to slick and slippery to use comfortably with wet soapy handes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I began buying a variety of vintage 3 piece razors to try and I would swap the handles with the EJ89 shave head.  They were better but none really impressed me. Finally I bought a Parker97 razor just to use the handle with the EJ.  Again ok but not great. Next I tried a Sabi T2 bulldog handle.  This was the best so far good weight,length and knurling. I happily used the Sabi for many months, but still felt something was lacking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After much research and price comparing I decided to try a Weber BullDog handle. I felt with the great reviews I was reading in the shave forums that even if the handle turned out to be just ok, I could easily sell it and recoup most if not all of my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I&#x27;ve used the Weber BullDog handle mated to my EJ89 shave head for a week now. The title for my review says it all! The fit and finish is excellent. The knurling, handle length and weight are perfect and actually do make a big difference in my shave.  My EJ89 shaves like a different razor now. My shaves are consistantly smooth, without irritation or razor burn and nick free. Razor control is the best I&#x27;ve ever experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so impressed with the handle I intend to get a Weber ARC shave head with a BullDog handle as soon as they become available.  As good as the handle is I can&#x27;t wait to try the shave head.  Plus if you compare prices the Weber is a FANTASTIC deal. You can get two SS Webers with two different shave head coatings(DLC/black and ARC/silver) and two different handles(Standard/BullDog) for the price of one of the other guys.  I hate sounding like a salesman but if you can afford a Weber handle get it.  I don&#x27;t think you will regret it.  Also the Weber will fit many 3 piece shave heads other than the EJ89. I know it fits all my 3 piece Gillettes, my Polish SS Lux and will even fit certain Gem and Ever Ready SE razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing I honestly feel the Weber is a quality American made product, being produced by a family run American company, costs less then a carton of cigarettes, will last forever and it WORKS! What else can you ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing the people at Weber make you feel they want your business.  Customer service has been great. All my questions were answered in a timely and courteous manner. The shipping was lighting fast also. I ordered on Friday and recieved my BullDog on Monday.</li>
    <li> The weight and grip are perfect! If you have a three piece razor, you need to get this handle. Great price too.</li>
    <li> I love this handle!  What an amazing difference it has made in my shaves with the Edwin Jagger DE89 head!  The weight is substantial and is just enough that I don&#x27;t feel the need to put any pressure - especially coming from a Cartridge shaving background.  Anyone who shaves with a DE, knows that pressure &#x3D; Razor Burn like never before in your life!  I look forward to shaving with this combo and know it will last for years to come!  Best part - made in the U.S.A. and rushed to your door via First Class Mail in days!  Keep it up Weber!</li>
