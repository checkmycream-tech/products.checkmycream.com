<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My daughter and I go through a mint egg a month it&#x27;s calming for bed</li>
    <li> This lip balm is amazing! I had a very bad cold and my lips had splits in 4 different places. So I applied the sweet mint that whole day. Well I woke up my lips were completely healed. I even used the mint under my nose to opening my sinuses. Great stuff!!!</li>
    <li> Well, This is a great product. The cool tingly sensation it gives feels awesome. Its not a burning sensation like blistex. And even when i licked my lips by mistake (which is a habit) It didnt taste disgusting, Couldn&#x27;t taste it at all. I love that its naturally derived, Organic. I love the eccentric shape. I love that it lasts a while, not easily wearing off. Its not overpriced. There is a good amount of balm in the tube, not a skimpy amount! I recommend this, it never hurts to try. It is not greasy at all, the person who wrote that is having oil issues within their own body, because this product is the least of oily by FAR!! The reviews are proof it is worth your money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of this product in the Sweet Mint flavor.   It goes on very smooth and, unlike others I&#x27;ve tried, this balm actually helps my lips.   Absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> work really well - keeps my lips moist for much longer than any other product I&#x27;ve used. I used to rely on Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm before I realized how much the wax dries out my lips. This product helps keep my lips moist all day and the egg shape is a great hit with everyone~</li>
    <li> The taste, texture, and smell of this is great and I&#x27;m super please with the results. My only complaint is that as the product starts wear down, it get awkward to apply.</li>
    <li> I came upon this while doing some online browsing and my interest was peaked to say the least.  Then a few days later I somehow managed to find it in my local drugstore, even though their selection was limited ( they only had the honeysuckle/melon and the sweet mint and I wanted the vanilla) I  choose the sweet mint because I love minty fresh lips and I&#x27;m happy to report that the choice was a wise one. I love this little nifty balm with its funky retro egg shape (bottom if flat for stability)  that still rolls of my desk if I put it down without looking but it&#x27;s really cute. I also really like the application, I have a habit of dipping my lips into tubs and tins of balm, and so this actually makes the application easy and still lets me coat the lip without using the fingers, which are a messy and not really hygienic way of applying anything.     The flavor is very refreshing, not sugary at all, and mint is very exhilarating especially in the summer also it&#x27;s nice to have a good lip balm that doesn&#x27;t smell like fruit cake which gets tiring at times. This is chock full of vitamin E and shea butter which really soothes dry lips, also the jojoba oil is one of my favorite ingredients ( its also great in shapoos) and best of all there are no parabens and petrolatum which end up irritating and suffocating the epidermis. You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this little beauty, it&#x27;s 95% organic now I&#x27;m craving the other flavors...best of all my lips don&#x27;t get itchy and burn, some lip balms with a lot of wax irritate them and this soothes and cools them...I think the mint flavor is perfect for both guys and galls, and leaves no color nor any glossy shine.     - Kasia S.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lip balm a couple of months ago, just to try something. My lips get so horribly chapped they start flaking and I&#x27;m constantly trying to bite the extra skin off. At the same time I purchased a couple other lip balms, and I haven&#x27;t used them since trying this one.      The round shape makes it easy to apply at once, you just glide the ball over your lips.  I go back and forth a couple of times, and it goes on super smooth. I don&#x27;t get that nasty slimy feeling that some lip balms can give, and you don&#x27;t feel sticky.  It gives me a bit of a cool feeling after it&#x27;s applied, and my lips feel moist and smooth.      The packaging is definitely unique, with the round shape a plus. It&#x27;s easy to open, you twist and it clicks into place. It seems like after use it would lose the integrity, but mine hasn&#x27;t and I continue to click it open and closed all the time when I need to fiddle with something.  It seems like there&#x27;s more lip balm in this then a stick (I haven&#x27;t compared qty to tell for sure).     The only bad thing I could possibly say about this, is the egg shape makes my dog think it&#x27;s his toy, and if I set it down within range he steals it and I have to chase after him. So my soft coated egg covering has a few doggy teeth marks in it :)     I&#x27;ve only tried the sweet mint, but it&#x27;s a cooling flavor with just a hint of mint, not overpowering like some balms.  I have completely ditched all the other lip balms and I&#x27;m only using this one now :) I&#x27;m very excited to see amazon carrying an 8 pack, because I want one with me wherever I go!</li>
    <li> Honestly, I love the smell of this and I love the look of it. It feels great going on. But it&#x27;s gone in seconds. And my lips were actually more dry because of it! I was so disappointed. I had to sleep with vaseline on my lips to reverse the drying effects. I tossed mine in the trash.</li>
    <li> I was afraid of buying this in a package of eight, but I did manage to find it at a local store a few weeks ago.  I suffer from pretty dry lips in the winter, and for some reason the regular chapstick just didn&#x27;t cut it this time.  I usually get another brand, in a small tin, but found that I always had to use a tissue to wipe my hands when I was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little ball is perfect!  It&#x27;s easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t go on messy.  Not only that, but it leaves your lips feeling silky smooth, even after the actual balm is long gone.  It also has a very pleasing taste, where most of the other lip balms I have tried are merely scented instead of flavored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once this little ball that I bought is gone, I am going to be coming back to Amazon to buy it in bulk.  My biggest fear is that this will fall along the wayside as many other beauty \\&quot;fads\\&quot; do, and I won&#x27;t be able to find it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback, and I am not even removing a star for it, is that the casing is a little awkward.  It&#x27;s a ball (with one end flattened), so it won&#x27;t sit flat in your pocket if you&#x27;re someone that doesn&#x27;t like to carry purses.  I&#x27;m a purse nut, though, and this fits perfectly in the front pocket of every one I have carried so far.</li>
    <li> I used to be a huge supporter of SoftLips, but my local pharmacy was all out.  I tried this stuff because I was honestly just looking for something with mint and doesn&#x27;t leave your lips sticky or greasy.  This stuff is amazing!  I immediately went onto Amazon and bought a case!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this lip balm for 2 weeks and I&#x27;m in love. My lips are very prone to dryness and normally only Lancome Juicy Tubes can help. These are much lighter, but still provide very good moisturization leaving the lips feeling fresh and smelling nice :) The form of the product is very ergonomical. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of lipbalm and this EOS lipbalm is amazing!  I bought this at first just because of the adorable packaging, but it&#x27;s also an AMAZING lipbalm.  It keeps my lips hydrated for long periods of time and makes them very soft :)  it also has a great smell.  not too strong.  It also tastes good if you accidentally lick it :)  i haven&#x27;t tried any of the other flavors but the sweet mint is pretty good!  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT! &gt;.&amp;lt;</li>
    <li> My daughter got these to give out to everyone at her wedding.  Neat little gift</li>
    <li> I would have given this 5 stars had it been 100% organic.  BUT it&#x27;s the best lip balm i&#x27;ve ever tried.  And I do believe some lip balms make your lips feel moisturized but has something that also dries them out to make it addictive (Carmex).  Anyway it&#x27;s pretty good stuff.  Maybe EOS will come out with something 100% organic.</li>
    <li> I never even liked lipbalm much.  To be honest, I only needed it a very few days out of the year - if I had a cold and it was windy.  A friend gave me some of the EOS Round lip balm in mint.  I stuck it in my purse and forgot about it for a month without ever opening it.  Then one day, after it had made it to the top of my desk, I opened it up and thought the round dome shape was really rather...neat.  I used it.  I liked it.  It doesn&#x27;t taste to me.  It does have a cooling effect on my lips that I really like.  I can barely smell it.  It slides on easily, and to me is more like the feel of some top layer lipglosses than say, Chapstick.  It&#x27;s slightly shiny, and moist.&lt;br /&gt;Well anyway, I kept using it.  It&#x27;s strangely addictive.  I have to remind myself that I don&#x27;t even LIKE lip balm.  I guess that is why I&#x27;m back looking to buy some more...maybe an 8 pack...&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t want it in any shape but the round.  It&#x27;s just cool, handy, kinda cute, and a bit sensual to put on.  I&#x27;m glad it is made of good stuff - I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> These are great lip balms. They smell like mint and taste sweet. They are very large like a egg but a little smaller, would not fit in pocket. THey are long lasting and make lips feel great. They coat your lips in sheer, light balm. I had to knock a star off because amazon shorted me one, says it comes with eight but I only got seven. One was taken out of the box.</li>
    <li> I would really give this product a three and a half star rating if Amazon allowed half-stars, and I even debated giving it only two or three stars. Eos doesn&#x27;t feel very moisturizing to my lips at all. This lip balm makes my lips feel weird in a not-so-great way. The texture of my lips with the balm on is waxy, almost sticky. If I try to rub my finger across them, my finger doesn&#x27;t glide at all and so as a lip balm, I really don&#x27;t care for it much. Vaseline is and always has been my preference. But having said that, this stuff smells delicious! It is so minty and sweet, and it also gives my lips a cool feeling. I keep putting it on my lips anyway, regardless of the sticky feeling, just because it smells so good. And I gotta say, the container it&#x27;s in is pretty cute. Because of these two features, I give it a higher rating. I&#x27;m probably going to use it as a lip scent, perhaps on top of my Vaseline. If it were not for the delicious scent, however, I wouldn&#x27;t use it at all and would be quite upset if I&#x27;d spent so much money getting an 8-pack.</li>
    <li> eos lip balms are far and away the best balms I&#x27;ve ever used.  My previous HGs were BBW&#x27;s CO Bigelow Mentha and Burt&#x27;s Bees. eos blows both of these out of the water. The shape is a bit difficult to get used to, but actually makes application much easier. Thanks eos!</li>
    <li> Minty feel well,use it very comfortable,my wife very like it ,she ready buy more for her friends and sister,it&#x27;s good thing.</li>
    <li> We have tried just about every type of commercial lip balm ou there.  I was nervous to buy an entire box of these when I had never tried them but I took a chance based on some others&#x27; comments.  I&#x27;m happy I did because these are DA BALM!      Seriously though, this is probably my favorite lip balm of all time now.  It goes on very smooth and, unlike others I&#x27;ve tried, this balm actually helps my lips.  I find with brands like Burts Bees and Blistex that my lips actually feel drier the more I use those.  This balm seems to keep my lips hydrated and I find I need it less.  And when you do use it, it has a nice refreshing peppermit feel (the Sweet Mint flavor - I haven&#x27;t tried the other flavors).  So now I&#x27;m extremely glad I ordered the pack of 8 because I don&#x27;t want to run out of this stuff!</li>
    <li> Eos has the best and cutest lip balm. In love with this product! I bought one for each of my bridesmaids!</li>
    <li> I really like this lip balm - it&#x27;s got a nice texture, and a nice, minty flavor.  I provided a picture because I didn&#x27;t realize just how big the container is!  I should&#x27;ve paid attention to the dimensions.  The staying power isn&#x27;t as good as other lip balms that I&#x27;ve tried; I seem to need to reapply often.  The SPF is a bonus.  This makes your lips \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; a little bit!</li>
    <li> This sweet mint EOS lip balm is wonderful.  The lip balm is smooth and soothing, but the spehere shape of the lip balm packaging is very clever and practical.  No, it might not be perfect in a jean pocket, but it is in a purse!  Great little grab bag item or stocking stuffer.</li>
    <li> I love these little, round lip balms! Great product, arrived sooner than expected-which is much appreciated. The packaging was cute too.</li>
    <li> Just picked up one of these at Walmart while at the checkout line. Wasn&#x27;t expecting to see it, but was really excited when I did. I really love it! It is all natural and was labeled \\&quot;Organic\\&quot; which I like because I hate the feel and smell of most lip balm. I&#x27;m really picky about lip gloss and have only found one brand that I will wear (Sephora). This stuff is awesome and smells like my essential oils and it keeps that nice tingling sensation on your lips without them feeling waxy. Great product! I will be buying this for Christmas presents. Also, the design is really great and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I bought an 8 pack of Eos Lip Balm as stocking stuffers for Christmas.  I kept one for myself and I couldn&#x27;t believe how great they work.  My office is so dry that I come home from work daily with dry cracked red lips.  I have this sitting on my desk and use it liberally throughout the day.  I have no more dry cracked lips.  The Summer Fruit is my favorite but the Sweet Mint is also good. I love the sphere design.  It&#x27;s easy to find in my purse.</li>
    <li> I am loving this flavor of EOS! I was already of lover of all the EOS lipbalms (except the Lemon Drop flavor, the texture was awful) and when I saw you could get the sweet mint on Amazon, I just couldn&#x27;t say no! I love this! Great purchase and Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;The flavor is not too strong and the texture is wonderful! No more greasy feeling around my lips! And, its 95% organic, and 100% all natural! Great!</li>
    <li> I love the sweet mint flavor lip balm! It&#x27;s smooth and in a fun shape that makes it really easy to apply!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a healthier lip balm than my old cherry chapstick standby.  Everything I tried went on really chunky, and I thought I was going to be stuck on chapstick brand forever.  This lip balm goes on smooth, has a wonderful scent, and actually works!  I only bought the one-pack because I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like it, but now I wish I had purchased the 8-pack so that I could have one in every room.  I wish there was a tinted version as I don&#x27;t wear lipstick and that&#x27;s the only way I can add color to my lips, but I love it enough that I still give it five stars despite that.</li>
    <li> The lip balm looks pretty cute, it is convenient to use at any given time or place, and works well on soothing and moisturizing your lips. The flavor is very refreshing, that will delight your mood when you use it. Also, its size is bigger than I imagined, which means you can use it for quite a while. What a deal!</li>
    <li> After raving about EOS lip balms to everyone who would listen (haha) I received some more of these lip balms as part of a Valentine&#x27;s Day gift. When it comes to lip balms, I&#x27;m not a mint fan by any stretch of the imagination, but this Sweet Mint is really nice and sweet! It&#x27;s my second favorite, right behind the honeysuckle honeydew. My youngest who doesn&#x27;t like anything minty, whether it&#x27;s gum or lip balm, is actually a fan of this flavor also. I honestly never would have purchased the mint for myself. Now that I&#x27;ve tried it, I&#x27;ll certainly purchase it on my own now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use beeswax based lip balms almost exclusively. The EOS balms are great at moisturizing your lips and have good staying power. The yummy flavors are a huge plus.</li>
    <li> I love this lipbalm. First, I love how the shape feels in my hands, second, and most importantly, it tastes great and is so moisturizing. The flavor is subtle. I&#x27;m just writing this review to let you all know that you can get it way cheaper at CVS. Happy shopping!</li>
    <li> I love these lil guys. Sweet Mint is my jam. Since I chew Orbit Sweet Mint gum, this was an obvious choice. Matching my lip gloss to my gum...that&#x27;s not weird, right? Anyway, stays on for a long time and it&#x27;s so easy to find in my purse.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm I have ever used. There is something about the almost spherical shape of the container that makes it really nice to hold in your hand, and the dome of lip balm goes on lips with a smooth feel and a delicious minty coolness to follow. Unlike other lip balms, this one does not leave the lips feeling sticky or greasy, just moist and soft. Now let&#x27;s talk about the container: as I said above, it is almost spherical but with enough \\&quot;direction\\&quot; to make it easy to hold. The surface is matte, not shiny, and almost feels warm to the touch. I did see another review that suggested this was too big to put in a pocket, and I suppose it does make a small bulge, as it is about the size of a table tennis ball. However, for me it acts like a worry stone, giving me something soothing to hold when needed.  Other flavors? I have so far tried the Sweet Mint, Honeysuckle Honeydew, Lemon Drop and Summer Fruit. I like all of them except the Summer Fruit which tastes rather chemical to me. The Sweet Mint is my favorite of the ones I have tried, and I am waiting for the Orange one to arrive as I write this. I highly recommend this item - don&#x27;t bother buying just one - you&#x27;ll be sorry and will need to come back to buy the 8-pack!</li>
    <li> I love the sweet mint! Being able to purchase multiples of my favorite flavor was awesome! I keep them everywhere!! Gave my boss one, now her husband &amp; her are buying them too! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled with dry lips, so I&#x27;ve gone through tons of different lip balms. This lip balm is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. My lips are so soft after using it. It smells and feels good because of the Sweet Mint. I also love that these are easy to find in your purse.</li>
    <li> If you have to pay more than $5/balm for this, buy it from target/walmart or elsewhere. This 8 pack is a good deal. I have the yellow (lemon), red, pale green, purple, mint green(this) and pink one. Lemon is the only one with SPF, and this mint flavor is the best out of the ones without SPF. Make it in SPF and I&#x27;ll give you 5 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: it&#x27;s color and unique shape makes it easy to find. The shape/indent/material makes it easy to grip even through thick gloves/mitt in the winter (instead of fiddling with tiny lip balm caps). The mint flavor is refreshing and the balm is moisturizing even in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: it doesn&#x27;t...melt but in hot weather or next to computer heat source, you can see the balm outer layer becomes shiny and a bit liquidy like it wants to melt.</li>
    <li> I have a ton of lipsticks, many in moisturizing formulations.  Ordinarily I wear lipstick all day.  But this week I&#x27;m sick, and didn&#x27;t want to waste my good lipsticks on lip care, so I slipped out to the drugstore and bought this based on the Amazon reviews.  It&#x27;s cute - and it was cheap - but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be any better than a Blistex or other moisturizing lip balm.  (It&#x27;s better than Chap Stik, though.)  It has sugar in it, or some fake-sugar, which I don&#x27;t like, and I can&#x27;t really smell the mint although that may be because I&#x27;m still sick.  But in any case I don&#x27;t really feel this is worth all the hoopla.  I&#x27;ve reapplied it about ten times in the last couple of hours.  Maybe I will go back to using my lipsticks, even though it&#x27;s somewhat of a waste.  Not to mention that a traditional-shape lip balm takes up a lot less space in a handbag.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite of all the EOS flavors.  The balm itself is thicker than vaseline but not quite as thick as Carmex.  I like the fact that it glides right on your lips without making you stick your finger in the jar.  The globe shaped top tends to form dents where I slide it over my lip each time so I have to remember to switch angles when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;Purchasing by the case with auto-subscribe means that I get the best price available anywhere!  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I give them as little gifts all the time.</li>
    <li> I like this lip balm a lot. I work in a cooler/freezer all day and my lips chap bad.&lt;br /&gt;With this they stay moist and I don&#x27;t have to worry about cracking or splitting.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the smell and taste. Great all around lip balm. I feel kinda girly using it,&lt;br /&gt;but when your lips hurt you don&#x27;t really care.</li>
    <li> Absolute favorite lip balm! It isn&#x27;t too overpowering with the mint flavor and it last forever. I carry one in my car, desk, purse, diaper bag, night stand, and anywhere else I spend a lot of time. Everyone in my family uses eos so buying it with subscribe and save does save a lot of money for the amount we use.</li>
    <li> This is a great lip balm and here&#x27;s why --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good texture (smooth, not sticky, not waxy, not goopy, not hard)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good ingredients (mostly organic)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good flavor (mild mint, not too sweet, not too pungent)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good packaging (nice matte texture on the tube makes it easy to hold and open, easy to spot in a bag)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good shape (sphere shape makes it very fast to put on either a little or a lot)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good price ($4 at most drugstores, etc. -- compares very well with an Aveda one I had that was over $10)</li>
    <li> My friend was always using the EOS peppermint lip balms. When we were at a store together, I saw this and asked why she liked the product. Without me knowing, she bought me this so I could try it myself! I know, nice friend right? I&#x27;ve really liked all of the EOS flavor/scent varieties. The peppermint is definitely my favorite. It is slightly cooling and pepperminty, in a nice refreshing way that isn&#x27;t too strong. I loved it so much that I returned the favor and bought it for another friend to try when she asked me how I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep it in my purse because I use it most often there, I always seem to notice my lips feel really dry after walking around the city, especially when it&#x27;s windy or cold out. I am very sensitive to smells and the scent is just so light. It&#x27;s enough of a scent where you can smell it, but it doesn&#x27;t really register much. I also can&#x27;t report on what it tastes like, which must mean the taste is similarly light/ pleasant otherwise I would have been greatly turned off of them by now. Definitely purchasing more when this gift pack runs out. Oh, speaking of which! My friend bought this for me in January and they are still holding up in July!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lip balm, easy to quickly cover your lips, they feel good and the mint is fantastic.  As a working mom, I love that it doesn&#x27;t get lost in my purse, I can always find it because of it&#x27;s odd shape, and it doesn&#x27;t roll off my desk.  I actually save money because I don&#x27;t keep loosing them!</li>
    <li> This feels great on my lips and feels great to put on. I love the little ball-shaped container. It is a completely different feeling to put this on compared to other lip balms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how you can apply it without touching the balm with your fingers.</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm. It is uniquely packaged and small enough to fit even in the smallest handbag or coat pocket. I love the mint scent as well because it&#x27;s subtle but strong enough to enjoy. Having 8 in a package is convenient because 1) it will last me a very long while and 2) it&#x27;s a great stocking stuffer or casual gift to giveaway.</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love this lip gloss?  It is my favorite.  Also, this is a great value pack, really cheap compared to buying individually or compared to the other tri or quad gift packs.  Definitely the best price I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
    <li> I got this package really fast and it was exactly what I expected. 8 new EOS Lip Balms in my favorite scent and each one of them sealed. Great great product.</li>
    <li> I think this chapstick is great, goes on very smooth, and for the most part it lasts a long time at least it does for me... and the mint is my fave by far.. I love the shape in the feel of it..  Not very pocket friendly I will admit, but sometimes while at work i spin it around like a Top .. lol can&#x27;t do that with other chapsticks</li>
    <li> good item&lt;br /&gt;speed shipping</li>
    <li> i constantly have chapped lips and am always picking them. Normally i just smear them in Vaseline, but they would just get dryer. eos is amazing for them, it tastes good and leaves my lips moisturized!!  I recommend eos since it is paraben and petroleum free, both of which are in most regular lip balms and actually dry out your lips, making you use the balm more. its more expensive than regular lip balm but its defiantly worth it!</li>
    <li> This has got to be the best lip balm on the planet! It&#x27;s super moisturizing, cute packaging, unique, smells wonderful, tastes good in case you&#x27;re a lip-licker, and stays on for a very long time. I put on a light coat right before I go to bed and when I wake up in the morning, it&#x27;s still there and my lips are soft for the day. Also this works as a very mild lip exfoliant. When I put it on at night, it penetrates into my lips and I guess the dead skin loosens. In the morning, I use a lip exfoliant to remove the dead skin, and then reapply. I don&#x27;t have to worry about dry, flaky lips not one more day! My boyfriend will testify that my lips are even more kissable than they were before! He can&#x27;t get enough of my lips!

    <li> my girls and i love this lip balm and the sphere shape is handy.</li>
    <li> Well I was using Blistex for a while and was almost out and I actually bought these on Costco&#x27;s website.  I was kind of hesitant because I didn&#x27;t want to be disappointed since it came in a box of 6.  Just after the first few hours of using it, I noticed that it didnt dry out my lips or make them feel sticky.  I abosolutly love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> This will sound weird but I bought this in a cold climate visiting family and I didn&#x27;t care for it while I used it there. I think the weather effected it, making it harder to smooth onto my lips. When I flew back to my tropical climate the balm softened up a lot and smooths on great and I LOVE it. It tastes delicious, is very moisturizing, and my favorite part --- It&#x27;s very tingly. I at first thought the shape was awkward, but I love it now! I love how I can set it up on my desk and it can&#x27;t roll away.</li>
    <li> Bought this product because it caught my eye while waiting to check out my items at Walmart. As soon as I tried it I absolutely loved it! Love texture because it&#x27;s not sticky or slippery. It&#x27;s relatively \\&quot;dry\\&quot; (I don&#x27;t know how else to describe it lol) and the total opposite of other balms I&#x27;ve tried--exactly how a lip BALM should be. And the tingliness is an added bonus. I&#x27;ll probably switch over to EOS from my usual Sugar :)</li>
    <li> This it the best lip balm ever</li>
    <li> Came all wrapped up well and brand new. Perfect to stock up with.</li>
    <li> SUPER strong mint smell...almost gives me a headache. I had to get used to it. I use the summer fruit flavor, and I wanted to try a different one, so I got the mint.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the product is nice. Not the best lipbalm EVER, but it&#x27;s pretty good. Glad it&#x27;s all natural and partially organic. It has stevia extract in it, which is kind of unnecessary since I&#x27;m not going to be eating the product...</li>
    <li> I bought a single one at my local drugstore and fell in love with the cute packaging and sweet scent. It&#x27;s my new favorite lip balm, it leaves my lips so smooth and soft. This flavor is my favorite, it&#x27;s very refreshing and sweet, but not in a fake-sugary kind of way. I also love that it&#x27;s all natural and has lots of ingredients that are good for your lips. When I lost my mint flavored one ( :&#x27;( ), i went to the drugstore and bought a different flavor. I have to say that mint is the best way to go. The other more popular flavor smelled like soap to me and tasted pretty gross. I was very happy when I found my mint lip balm. I like both, but I know I&#x27;ll run out of the mint faster.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I recently bought one of the Eos Lip Balms at the store and fought over the mint scented one!  This was the perfect solution--enough for both of us to have one in a purse, one in the desk at school, one in the coat pocket and still have extras!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter is addicted to lip balm and this is by far her favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received quickly and it great condition.</li>
    <li> Very cute appearance, even for a guy. [gossip dudes] Bought them for colleages as gifts. So I didn&#x27;t open the package. I bought another yellow lemon one from Target for myself. Good smell, sweet flavor.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I took one star off is, compared with other lip balms, it&#x27;s a litter dry, not that greasy. So not as long as I expected it will keep you feel moisturized last. Anyway, good.</li>
    <li> Used as stocking stuffers but would definately buy the pack for party favors or gifts again.  Very nice product.  Happy with it.</li>
    <li> My wife use it, she told me the mint is great.&lt;br /&gt;In winter, she always use it to prevent dry lips.</li>
    <li> The lip balm is smooth, not too minty or sweet that it&#x27;s overpowering. Nice texture and comfortable to put on. Great product!</li>
    <li> Everything is fine. I am happy with the purchase. I think that more and buy more than once. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I try to drink water through the day, but the chap stick I was using, tasted REALLY bad. So I would have to either; A: not drink water or B: not wear chap stick, and have sandpaper for lips. This product is perfect! I don&#x27;t have to walk around with my gross after taste of chap stick AND my lips are baby butt soft :) I had very chapped lips ^ I chose &amp;#34;b&amp;#34;, I like my water. These bad boys had my lips back to new after 2 days. No cracks, dryness, or pain. Super happy customer here! I recommend this product to EVERYONE.</li>
    <li> These lip balms are creamy and silky to apply, and I love the round shape. The sweet mint &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; is fresh and not over sweet or scented. The round shape means you can apply the balm to both lips with one swish, for whatever that&#x27;s worth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pack of 8 turned out to be a good buy. I sent some of them to my young nieces (8 &amp; 11) along with their Christmas gifts, and their mom said that the EOS products were their favorite stocking stuffers. So I&#x27;d guess a female of almost any age would enjoy having one.</li>
    <li> great customer service, product as expected.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS \\&quot;CHAPSTICK FROM HEAVEN\\&quot;THIS IS THE GREATEST CHAPSTICK IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. I&#x27;VE OWNED A LOT OF REALLY GOOD CHAPSTICKS BUT THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST(I LOVE SMOOTHLIPS TOO) I GOT THE SWEET MINT FLAVOR AND I CAN&#x27;T GET ENOUGH EATING IT WHILE ITS ON MY LIPS. IT TASTES AND SMELLS REALLY GOOD. IT&#x27;S LIKE GETTING SKITTLES LIPGLOSS AND LICKING OFF ALL OF IT BY THE 1ST HOUR. IT SMELLS AMAZING. THE DESIGN IS AMAZING AND REALLY HYDRATES YOUR LIPS. MY LIPS IN THE BEGINNING OF THE DAY WAS REALLY CHAPPED BUT BY THE END OF THE DAY, THEY WERE REALLY SMOOTH.&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS A MUST BUY!!!!</li>
    <li> My granddaughter introduce me to EOS &amp; I found that the Sweet Mint was my FAV. So when I found it on Amazon, I was thrilled to find it came in a Pack of 8. I carry one in my purse, have one on my endtable, and one by my bedside. I&#x27;m so very please with my purshase. I also share them with my family, so I&#x27;ll be looking for more to purchase..</li>
    <li> These are the best thing they ever made all my friends enjoyed them</li>
    <li> This caused the sides of my mouth to split open, at first I thought the splitting was from the cold weather. I ended up misplacing this one and picked up a strawberry one a few months later, and  the sides of my mouth tore again. I am forever off EOS! Since I&#x27;ve stopped using this product the mouth splits disappeared and haven&#x27;t come back.</li>
    <li> This mint one and the tangerine are the best EOS lip balms IMO. I love how smooth they go on, the only thing I dont like is the shape, they dont fit into small purses or pockets well. I love that there are no parabens either. A warning though, these are addictive.</li>
    <li> They were just as expected perfect!</li>
    <li> I guess I am of the minority here because I do not see what all the fuss is with these lip balms... i really wanted to love these as much as everyone else seems to. They are adorable to look at and do apply very easily amd smoothly but that&#x27;s the best things I have to say.. within a few seconds of applying it, my lips feel sticky and dry. At this point i am only continuing to use it so that i dont feel so guilty for spending over $3 for it. My coworker has the same issue with it so I am glad to know at least one person who feels the same way.</li>
    <li> I found this minty lip balm too strong.  It burned my mouth! I like the mango flavor a lot better.</li>
    <li> Everyone in my family loves this lip balm---though in different flavors. It feels so good and moisturizing on the lips and lasts a while. And the little egg is fun. I like the Sweet Mint as it has a nice &amp;#34;flavor for the breath&amp;#34;. I use these as stocking stuffers at Christmas.</li>
    <li> product and very good.&lt;br /&gt;recommend this product .&lt;br /&gt; excellent&lt;br /&gt;packaging easy. for practical use. performs miracles.&lt;br /&gt;toos use here at home. we&#x27;re loving</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a glossy balm, this isn&#x27;t it. It leaves the lips healthy and smooth without any shine, so it would be excellent for men. The peppermint taste is mild, but gives just a bit of tingle to the lips, very nice. I thought it would be hard to apply, but it glides on very easily. I like the fact that is has no petroleum.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product, and am even slightly addicted. The minty smell is nice, and i love the texture. Once i apply it it DOES feel waxy, but that is my preference as I  do not like the greasy Vaseline-like consistency of other balms. It lasts about two hours (but I apply more often due to my addiction).</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm!! My friend found it at WalMart, and I&#x27;ve been addicted to it ever since. It has the healing power of Burt&#x27;s Bees, but is smoother and smells nicer. The balm is the size of a very small egg. Think of the diameter of a quarter, but in a sphere shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Can apply to both lips in one swipe&lt;br /&gt;- AMAZING for chapped lips&lt;br /&gt;- Smells really nice&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t leave a weird white residue&lt;br /&gt;- Long-lasting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Applicator is bigger than a traditional lip balm/Chap Stick, so it&#x27;s hard to keep in your pocket&lt;br /&gt;- Guys think it looks girly, so they refuse to use it&lt;br /&gt;- People will ask you why you&#x27;re putting an Easter egg on your mouth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the pros far outweigh the cons! The large box is such a bargain.</li>
    <li> stick to the cap and does not come off....</li>
    <li> After being sick and tired of my usual lip balm which never seemed to heal my dry cracked lips I thought I would give the EOS lip balms ago after hearing they are organic and do not have petroleum as an ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is wow, I have been using this for only a week now and my lips are so different. They are no longer dry, red, cracked and tight. I was skeptical as to whether a lip balm could make such a difference but it definitely has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use to find I was applying lip balm constantly throughout the day because my lips were always so tight and dry feeling, however with the EOS lip balm I only apply 2-3 times a day depending on the weather and what I may be doing. I can now actually wear lipstick without my lips looking flakey and dry now too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sweet mint scent and flavour is delicious, when you first apply it you get a slight tingle, however it&#x27;s not a tingle that feels like it is hurting/reacting to your lips, and subsides after a minute or so leaving you with moisturied soft lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definately give this a try, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
</ol>
