      <li>It is a must have that leaves your face soft, even toned, and refreshed.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ve paid a lot more and not experienced such pleasantries, which are....</li>

    <li> This a truly wonderful product.  The mask leaves my skin feeling softened and refreshed.  I use this weekly so fafar - will advance use as needed&lt;br /&gt; The staff at Med spa is wonderful.  They are the 1st seller I&#x27;ve had to follow up their transaction.  I will definitely try more Revision products as they are very high quality and I will purchase them from Med Spa!</li>
    <li> Completely satisfied with both quality of product and shipping.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin feeling smooth and brighter appearance. Used the product line and overall tone and texture have improved.</li>
    <li> Great mask. Leaves face radiant. I use twice a week.</li>
    <li> It works just fine, but isn&#x27;t going to cure your blackheads.  I have very oily skin and doesn&#x27;t really help with stubborn blackheads.  I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> I really like it works well.  I have sensitive skin, so I just have to be careful on the amount to use</li>
    <li> Mainly because this wasn&#x27;t the produce I was looking for, and it came in a plain with box with no paperwork.&lt;br /&gt;so I wasn&#x27;t able to return it.  This was the first time I rec&#x27;d packaging like this.  I will not order from this company again.</li>
    <li> I just love this mask. I used this mask at night before bed. When I went into work the next morning, my co-worker said my skin looked ironed. Smooth, reduced pore size and wrinkles less noticeable.</li>
    <li> The only reason I give it four and not five stars is I think it is a bit pricey for the ingredients. But this is the first mask I&#x27;ve used over the years that I felt was worthwhile in terms of leaving my face feeling refreshed and soft. Mostly, I don&#x27;t use masks, but I got a tiny sample from a spa, and it lasted for three or four treatments. I usually stick with products with a known result, like a peel or exfoliation. But it you like to just pamper yourself and use something that will soften, this is a great product. I am trying to envision a 1.7 ounce, and that&#x27;s about three times the size of my Kiehl Avocado cream. But of that you use just a dab, this mask you need to use what they call a generous amount. So it&#x27;s gonna go fast with weekly use.</li>
    <li> LEAVES YOUR SKIN SOFT AND CLEAN. HOWEVER IT IS MESSING. I WOULD RECOMMEND WETTING A PAPER TOWEL THEM RINSING WITH WATER AND DABBING WITH A HAND TOWEL.</li>
    <li> Very relaxing to use while soaking in the tub.  My skin glows the next day after I use this product.</li>
    <li> I love this black mask it is the best facial mask I have ever used.  I put in on my skin every wednesday night, put the firming night cream over it and I have perfectly smooth clean skin</li>
    <li> One of my favorite beauy products!</li>
    <li> Leave skin smooth and not overly dry. Perfect</li>
    <li> This is not REALY Nectifim. The logos are different. Not sure who is selling this, but it is not a legitimate product.</li>
    <li> Revision products are excellent, especially the black mask.  It is a must have that leaves your face soft, even toned, and refreshed.</li>
    <li> I adore this mask. It was recommended by my dermatologist as a way to control oil without drying the life out of my skin. My skin has changed and while my skin is oily and prone to breakouts the products aimed at teens were the way too harsh. I also have to say I have very sensitive skin as well and this has not caused any irritation. I use it twice a week and feel my skin is less oily but not parched after using it. You do need to know that this mask will discolor whatever you use to take it off because of the clays in it. I have a dedicated washcloth I use to take it off with and this is not an issue for me.</li>
    <li> love it and a client favorite. Priced well.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one who generally loves facial masks as I find them drying or containing irritating chemicals, regardless of price paid, I&#x27;ve never enjoyed a facial mask, except this one. I don&#x27;t believe it to be pricey as stated by others, I&#x27;ve paid a lot more and not experienced such pleasantries, which are.... the consistency of the mask is smooth and creamy, not runny or chalky. The mask stays put, doesn&#x27;t drip down the chin or irritate the eyes from extreme chemical abuse. I thoroughly enjoyed my 20 minute facial and after removing the mask, my skin looked great. The only thing I would advise is be careful the mask doesn&#x27;t get on any clothing as it does stain, aside from that issue, it&#x27;s a wonderful product for price paid.</li>
    <li> This product makes my skin feel and look amazing.  I use it 3-4 times a week and love the results.</li>
    <li> Great mask, fast shipment.</li>
