      <li>This serum is exactly what I needed to compliment the gorgeous scent of the shampoo/conditioner.</li>
      <li>This serum works wonders - it&#x27;s light enough to not mat-down my hair, yet gets rid of the fly-aways wonderfully.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t make my hair particularly soft or exceptionally shiny, just kind of weighted and</li>
      <li>But boy, did it smell scrumptious - warm, sweet (but not over the top sweet), and toasty.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

      <li>a little drop is need and your hair smell great and look shiny.</li>
      <li>Clearly, if you have longer, thicker hair, you will use more.  </li>
      <li>Still, I find it is worth the money and</li>
      <li>The product is totally buildable amount wise, so you can use however much you need for silky seductive results.</li>
      <li>and I was convinced this would be a smart purchase!</li>
      <li>But the seller was honest, and the product came as expected.</li>
      <li>it smells great and leaves a subtle shine that lasts for days.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s far better then the Coconut Oil serum (for me) because it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product made my hair too flat. I did like the scent!</li>
    <li> I have really short hair and this product helps my hair once I have washed it and need to put some product it my hair that smells really good. I would recommend this product for short hair.</li>
    <li> Smells great!! Not too heavy for my long thick, course hair. Helps get rid of the frizzy&#x27;s and makes my hair soft. I put a squirt into the palm of my hand and rub my hands together and run my fingers through the underside of my hair just after I wash it. I concentrate mostly on the ends, at least an inch away from the scalp. Be careful not to use too much or it will be heavy and greasy looking. Just use a small amount and add more a little at a time as needed. If my hair is dry and it needs some frizz taming I use the same method. Again do not slather is on your hands like lotion and slop it on your hair. Great product and you cant beat the price when you only have to use a little. The bottle lasts for months.</li>
    <li> This product is great for increasing managability of ethnic hair. And the smell drives men wild- probably because most men love any smell that reminds them of food. Dual benefit, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> I just bought this shine serum and it is just the best. I used a small amount on my hair at the office and the next person that came in said \\&quot;Wow, your hair is so shiny! What are you using\\&quot;? That NEVER happens to me. Next thing you know, everyone was stopping by to try some and all of them were amazed at the results. I have natural kinky curly hair and need all the shine I can get. It has a pleasant vanilla scent, not too strong and doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy. After I rub it into my hair, I massage the rest onto my cuticles and hands and it keeps them nice and soft too. Excellent product and a little goes a long way so it should last a while.</li>
    <li> I use to buy a case of 6 for like 35 dollars and now one bottle cost half that price.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum.  It&#x27;s far better then the Coconut Oil serum (for me) because it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair.  It smells phenomenal!  One pump is more then enough for my scalp and my hair which is a couple of inches past my shoulder.  This product gives hair shine and manageability and it drives men wild.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Organix Silk Serum, Soft &amp; Silky Vanilla Silk works great when applied to wet hair before blow drying. With medium length, fine blond hair a pea sized amount of product is perfect. I tried the serum one day after blow drying - BIG MISTAKE! Made my hair look super greasy and severely weighed down.</li>
    <li> Like any serum, this stuff can be heavy.    However, this stuff is amazing when used to blow out curls. It leaves the hair silky shiny and soft to touch.     When used alone, I find it has a weird undertow.    Still, I find it is worth the money and the results on the blow out were so impressive that I will probably be buying this stuff for years.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I am a huge advocate for this brand...I love this smell the best of all their scents, it reminds me of vanilla frosting, yummy:) It makes my (very long) hair super soft and smelling delicious:)    Plus, Organix is eco-friendly another great plus for me!</li>
    <li> The Organix Soft &amp; Silky Vanilla Sky Silk Serum does just  that... leaves your hair soft and silky to the touch.  I have straight medium length normal hair and I have a horrible habit of playing with and running my fingers through my hair all day long.  This product really works well leaving your hair soft and silky to the touch... even on windy days.  I always finish my hair retune with Organix Soft &amp; Silky Vanilla Sky Silk Serum!</li>
    <li> I love the idea of vanilla scent but when the package came, I was so excited of using it. The smell is overpowering and it gives me headaches.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  it smells great and leaves a subtle shine that lasts for days. My hair is about 3-4 inches below my shoulder and one pump is enough to cover my entire head.  I used another half of a pump to apply down my side part.  My hair is usually dry so i like that the serum isn&#x27;t heavy and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or get too greasy.  Just great stuff.</li>
    <li> MY HAIR HAS GROWN LONGER THAN EVER. BEST PURCHASE</li>
    <li> This serum is exactly what I needed to compliment the gorgeous scent of the shampoo/conditioner. I have very thick, naturally wavy/frizzy hair and require a smoothing product prior to straightening. This serum works wonders - it&#x27;s light enough to not mat-down my hair, yet gets rid of the fly-aways wonderfully. So glad I purchased this!</li>
    <li> I am yet another person satisfied with this great product. I did my homework, looking for a hydrating hair product in the oil specrum that wasn&#x27;t going to break my bank. I knew from past experience Organix was an affordable brand that I can usually trust. I saw the reviews and I was convinced this would be a smart purchase! My hair is thick and wavy, and I rarely ever style it. However, with my hair type, and my humid climate, my hair is often set up for a dull frizziness. This does what is says it&#x27;s suppose to do. My hair has a lasting frizz free look and a silky shine. Plus the smell of this stuff; wow. It&#x27;s smells like totally tempting vailla. The scent lingers and lasts, but it&#x27;s not overpowering. My hair looks so much more polished! The product is totally buildable amount wise, so you can use however much you need for silky seductive results. Please stop searching and pick this up. I loved this, and I am sure I will continue purchasing.    *I tried this on my mother. Her hair is fine due to age. She has it styled in a farely layered bob. This serum didn&#x27;t even weigh her hair down! It looked very shiny, she is going to get some too.</li>
    <li> Never have ran across this in the stores. I love the coconut oil one. This one smells great. Little goes a long way. Will make your hair greasy looking if you use too much. I apply a small amount the each section of hair when I curl it. Get compliments on how nice my hair smells. Smells like vanilla. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> favorite hair product ever &amp; I can&#x27;t find it in stores any where anymore. Worth the extra $1 or 2 over store price to have it again. It smells delicious &amp; does the job well, not sticky like similar products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Just a little drop is need and your hair smell great and look shiny.</li>
    <li> Hm,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit disappointed in the functionality of this serum. But boy, did it smell scrumptious - warm, sweet (but not over the top sweet), and toasty.&lt;br /&gt;The actual serum is a bit sticky and even when smoothed across my palms it&#x27;s hard to spread around properly. It didn&#x27;t leave my hair smelling like vanilla (like some reviewers mentioned) which was also disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final notes:&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t make my hair particularly soft or exceptionally shiny, just kind of weighted and maybe a tad shinier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll stick to my trusted OGX Argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again. But the seller was honest, and the product came as expected.</li>
    <li> I really like how it makes my hair feel and smell. I have long thick hair and I&#x27;ve tried a variety of anti-frizz oils, this one is my favorite so far!  Did I mention it smells super delicious?!</li>
    <li> This product is almost impossible to find in the local stores.  There is every other label but this one is the cheapest and the best.  I love it and it will last a very long time as you only use very very little.  It shines all of your hair bringing out the variations in tone without the greasy feel.  Just clean and shiny - just the best.</li>
    <li> I want to rub this stuff all over my body.  It smells so YUMMY!!!  My hair is styled in a short bob with bangs and is thick.  I use less than a quarter size of this product.  I start at the back of my hair (roots) and work to the front.  I get the roots done, and then work my way to the tips.  It may seem like you do not have enough product... YOU DO!!!  Just keep working the product through your hair.  A little goes a long way.  Clearly, if you have longer, thicker hair, you will use more.  Or if you want to smell the product more, use more.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find a silicone free shine serum that actually works! It smells like vanilla and the fragrance really lasts, which is nice. I use one pump on my ends every morning, and it absorbs really well, leaving my hair shiny and smelling really nice.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this!! Organix products are the best!!</li>
    <li> Love the feel, shine and smell!!!! If you love vanilla, you will adore this product!</li>
