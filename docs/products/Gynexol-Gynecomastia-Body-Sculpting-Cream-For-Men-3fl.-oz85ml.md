<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am seeing results from this product.  The results are not a cure, but a reduction of gynecomastia is apparent.  It is a bit pricey I think.</li>
    <li> I purchased the sculpting cream through amazon, and was suspicious at first because there really weren&#x27;t any credible sources of information/reviews at all (besides the other review here) for this product. I went with this product as opposed to the pill form because it was cheaper and low risk. Treatment was shipped in 10 days. The \\&quot;Body Sculpting Cream For Men\\&quot; is more or less a gel (clear, slimy) that you apply directly to your chest a couple times per day. My chest has flattened in the 8 weeks that I&#x27;ve applied the \\&quot;cream\\&quot;, but it&#x27;ll take 2 or 3 more months to get the results I&#x27;m looking for. My nipples still jot out from the chest fat underneath, but not as much as before. I&#x27;d recommend this product as a first-time, low-risk treatment for sufferers of gyn, but understand that it could take up to a year (4 tubes of this stuff) to see significant results, depending on how bad you have it. I trust the product and the company, and may give the pills a try. Disclaimer: I&#x27;m neither obese nor overweight.</li>
    <li> I tried 3 bottle of these and no results save your money people. Im also thinking about trying the tablets but im not sure i dont want surgery.</li>
    <li> Rediculous claims this stuff did not work at all....may have been a bad batch of cream.  It was not even a cream.  It was a bluish colored liquid water substance that when trying to pour into your hand would flow right through your fingers like water.  Plus little tube for $85+ is absurd and I would like my money back.</li>
    <li> i sent the product back after using it for 3 months and no change what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just work out and eat healthy.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me what so ever. I thought I&#x27;ve found the product but it&#x27;s just another lie, I don&#x27;t want surgery.</li>
    <li> When we got the bottle in the mail, the cream is very runny and thin. It was for my son and tried using it a couple of days and it is so runny it is hard to put on. We were wondering if it is defective and that&#x27;s why it is so runny. He stopped using it because it is so hard to apply.</li>
    <li> Do not waste this much money on this product.  It does not work at all period</li>
    <li> I have now been using this product faithfully twice a day for almost 6 weeks. I&#x27;m sure I have about 2-3 weeks left in the container, but up to this point there have been 0 results, and I don&#x27;t think another 2 weeks will change anything. I promised myself I would write a long and detailed review for everyone on Amazon to look at, so here goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, instructions are simple. You apply the cream twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening. I found that I was accidentally letting too much out of the bottle, and have found an easier way to do it. Hold the bottle upside down and let it come out by itself, or give it a light squeeze. Also, always leave the bottle with the cap facing up, because otherwise it will get stuck in the cap and you will lose a little bit (for $75 you want every last drop of it). You massage it well onto your body and let it dry before you put your clothes back on, usually takes about 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product claims to reduce gynecomastia or fat in the chest, and that is works in 99% of all users. I bought this product knowing that this claim can be nowhere near true. I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle nor major results, but anyone who has considered this product should know that even the smallest difference would be worth it. In my case, there has been no difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been watching over this product on Amazon for about a year. Back then I was overweight/obese and figured I should just lose weight to get rid of these. I have now lost 70 pounds and I am in great shape, but my chest still sticks out. A year ago, there was only one review, and it didn&#x27;t seem trustworthy. Up to the time I bought it, there were a few more, but still didn&#x27;t answer my questions so I figured if I wanted something done I had to do it myself. Hopefully my review can help anyone else out here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I workout six times a week (running &amp; weights), couldn&#x27;t have a better diet, and drink plenty of water. I figured if this thing would work on anyone, it should be me with how hard I work. But it simply doesn&#x27;t, no results. I have been taking lots of pictures from many angles every single week to track my progress, and there is no difference from day one to the most recent date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a feeling that the &#x27;good&#x27; reviews on this product are from the people in this company, trying to make their product look good. If you look into the profiles of these reviewers, they have no reviews except for one on this product. It&#x27;s kind of sad that there are people out there who would do anything to make a quick buck. I definitely feel ripped off for buying this, and will never consider any products that would help with the problem, especially from this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good $75 went down the drain for me, and I hope my review helps you save yours. I think the best thing to do is continue exercising, and maybe look into natural supplements like turmeric root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you guys have any questions at all about this product, i&#x27;ll be happy to answer in the comments.

    <li> I bought this to reduce my fat chest. I tried this everyday combined with wide-grip push ups  and thought I was loosing some fat. It was actually sculpting my chest but after few months, I lost a bit female hormones growing in my chest. If it doesn&#x27;t work for any of you than it can also be used as a lubricant. The sensation is extreme and use with caution.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not really working</li>
    <li> I have just finished using one 85ml tube of this product. I have not seen any changes at all so far. I am not quite sure how this product works or after how long of usage can one see some results. Has anyone else tried this please do share your experience. The product is expensive and it should at least show some positive results but so far I can&#x27;t see any...</li>
    <li> Nothing happened still the same</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend, I can&#x27;t really tell if the product is good or not, but it didn&#x27;t come in a box.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think this product actually did anything however initially it gives some dryness in the application area making it look less puffy. But once you wash it off its back to the way it was. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money and time on this.</li>
    <li> useless, it doesn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s a scam. I thought the bad reviews about this product were not true, but now I know they are.</li>
    <li> Dont waster your money!... eat healthy and reduce body fat</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. This stuff doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Price needs to be reduced. It seems to work for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s liquid base not a cream...Priced to high and do not work.</li>
