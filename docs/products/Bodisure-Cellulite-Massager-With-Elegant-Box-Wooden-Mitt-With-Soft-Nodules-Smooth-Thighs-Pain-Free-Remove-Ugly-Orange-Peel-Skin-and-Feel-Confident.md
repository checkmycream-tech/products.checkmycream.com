      <li>I got this for free as promotional sample in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
      <li>I just used this on my outer thighs and was able to increase circulation quite well.  </li>
      <li>As soon as I see visible results I will be sure to post.</li>
      <li>I was provided a free sample of this item for my honest review.</li>
      <li>Well made..and love the girly heart shape</li>
      <li>I wasnot able to find what she had bought and opted to buy this.</li>
      <li>Lovely design and packaging.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>With continued use I can see can see even more improvement.</li>

      <li>This is a great product that I would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Works pretty good.</li>
      <li>: Beautifully packaged that makes it such that it is appropriate for gift giving&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for message and helps release fat and cellulite and leaves you with toned and soft skin.</li>
      <li>It came with beautiful box , I normally throw the box of the product I use in my daily routing but this one was so good I have to save it.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still comfortable.</li>
      <li>Heart-shaped form that fits comfortably in your hand</li>
      <li>I really enjoy it.</li>
      <li>This is a very well made and nice massager.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These are great to keep in the shower and rub the back of the thighs!  </li>
      <li>I liked it so much that I gave one to a friend.</li>
      <li>(I lightly stroked my cat just to see if he&#x27;d enjoy it</li>
      <li>I received this at a discount for my honest opinion &amp; in my own personal opinion....</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>The brush part has a good texture that applies enough pressure without becoming abrasive.</li>
      <li>The brush is very comfortable to hold and the nubs are very smoothe and comfortable on the skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;She appreciates that the massager feels like a good deep massage.</li>
      <li>initial impressions were that the massager is of good quality and well-made.</li>
      <li>I review all products as if I paid full price for it.</li>
      <li>However, my skin was SO smooth after using this and the seaweed powder that it&#x27;s almost worth using this every day just for the smoothness and exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The shape of the massager was just right to comfortably fit in my hand.  </li>
      <li>Lotion can probably be an adequate substitute for facilitating the massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I received this for free or a reduced price but the above is my honest opinion.</li>
      <li>And feels nice as a back massager too.</li>
      <li>I bought  this because other customers gave it good reviews.</li>
      <li>so I know it is shepherding the cream right in (</li>
      <li>and I was able to hold onto this with either hand with no trouble (the fabric handle/strap certainly</li>
      <li>only wish would be that the hand strap were either elastic or adjustable as it&#x27;s large for my hand and serves no purpose as is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a promotional discount on this product, however, my reviews are always honest and unbiased regardless of price I paid.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s made of wood and soft rubber which is a perfect combination as you can massage with hard wood</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure there are a ton of similar products for sale on Amazon, so first I&#x27;ll speak to the construction of this item</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;bristles\\&quot; or nodules are a very smooth wood with no splinters or uneven parts -- this is important for something you&#x27;ll be rubbing on your skin.  </li>
      <li>product that I plan on enjoying a long time.</li>
      <li>but it certainly can&#x27;t hurt to help circulation.</li>
      <li>Its very soothing and great if you have a partner that is willing to use a little body oil and use it on your back.</li>
      <li>significant other was really excited to try this product after I was contacted to review it.</li>
      <li>She particularly liked that it was heart-shaped and easy to hold--she has been using it in the shower for the last few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Its water proof so the water doesn&#x27;t seep into the bristles and is very durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample</li>
      <li>It really helps to break up those fat pockets and rush blood to the area</li>
      <li>This cellulite massager mitt is a very well made product.</li>
      <li>This prevented me from getting as much pressure into the skin as I was wanting.</li>
      <li>The massage feels great really helps with my legs feeling tired and my skin is smoother.</li>
      <li>Nice box,,, Been using for a few weeks and see a decrease in cellulite appearance.</li>
      <li>so they bend and curve just enough so its not painful.</li>
      <li>High quality all around.</li>
      <li>Again, there was not too much cellulite to begin with, but there is no permanent discernible change in appearance thus far.</li>
      <li>The bristles are smooth and does not feel rough on the body.</li>
      <li>The nubs are not hard they&#x27;re made out of some sort of resin</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s large enough to fit your entire hand, the center is flexible like a soft brush so the wooden pegs are able to move and adapt to your body shape.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>: Soft wooden nubs feel fantastic while working the various areas of your body&lt;</li>
      <li>I personally feel that it is working, although the truth will be told this summer when I actually put on a pair of shorts for the first time in a while!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a very well made and nice massager. I liked it so much that I gave one to a friend. The wooden elements are so much nicer than plastic (against your skin). High quality all around.</li>
    <li> Product is well made and comes in a very nice gift type box. However, I did not like the shape. I was a bit awkward to hold on to. My hands are med-small with long fingers. The wood &amp;#34;prongs&amp;#34; are attached to a dome like, flexible piece of rubber, which gives (has push back). This prevented me from getting as much pressure into the skin as I was wanting. Only the center prongs seem to have good skin contact so the others are not very effective. It may be effective at helping with cellulite. Too early to tell. I do know that it doesn&#x27;t  have that feel.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good. Like how my thighs feel after I used it. Only been using it for a few weeks seeing some results.</li>
    <li> This massager is very nicely designed and does a good job for providing a nice massage to your skin. It has a wooden base with a strap to keep your hand steady while holding it. The brush part has a good texture that applies enough pressure without becoming abrasive. This item is durable and even comes in a storage box with a magnetic clasp. This is great to use for yourself or to provide beauty treatments for others or as a gift. I was provided a free sample of this item for my honest review.</li>
    <li> It came with beautiful box , I normally throw the box of the product I use in my daily routing but this one was so good I have to save it.This product works great, heart shape gives it a unique look.It&#x27;s made of wood and soft rubber which is a perfect combination as you can massage with hard wood but as the base is made of soft rubber it provides flexibility and softness.It&#x27;s great for message and helps release fat and cellulite and leaves you with toned and soft skin.The reason why I gave it 4 star and not five is because after few use the tip of the wood changed it color to dark brown may be because I was using it with coffee scrub.I got this for free as promotional sample in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Good quality, easy to handle.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure there are a ton of similar products for sale on Amazon, so first I&#x27;ll speak to the construction of this item so you have something to compare it to if you are trying to make a decision.  This has a wooden backing and a fabric handle, then a pliable/bendable rubber part attached to the wooden \\&quot;bristles.\\&quot;  The \\&quot;bristles\\&quot; or nodules are a very smooth wood with no splinters or uneven parts -- this is important for something you&#x27;ll be rubbing on your skin.  I have very small hands and I was able to hold onto this with either hand with no trouble (the fabric handle/strap certainly helped).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rubber part allows the bristles/nodules to move a little, but you can still get a lot of good force behind the massage.  I just used this on my outer thighs and was able to increase circulation quite well.  I could even rub hard enough to make it hurt just a little (not in a bad way, but in a way that I knew that this was working).  The rubber part allows the bristles/nodules to conform better to the shape of the body (something that wouldn&#x27;t work with a completely hard backing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles/nodules exfoliated my skin, as well.  It wasn&#x27;t something I was expecting but the amount of exfoliation indicated that it was something that needed to be done.  After I used this for 5-10 minutes on my outer thighs, I applied a paste of seaweed powder (since both this massager and seaweed powder are supposed to reduce cellulite).  I think it will take time -- and daily use -- to truly see cellulite reduction.  However, my skin was SO smooth after using this and the seaweed powder that it&#x27;s almost worth using this every day just for the smoothness and exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this is primarily wooden, it holds up well after getting wet in the shower.  The wood maintains a nice temperature for use next to or on the body, unlike something such as metal (would get cold) or glass (could break).  All parts/nodules/handles/etc. were attached well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.uct provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.</li>
    <li> Well made..and love the girly heart shape</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush to rub my neck and shoulders as well as attempting to massage areas prone to cellulite (sometimes in combination with a cellulite cream.) It really helps to break up those fat pockets and rush blood to the area so I know it is shepherding the cream right in (increased blood flow to the area increases absorption of skin products.) It also has an unintentional side benefit of giving my arms a toning workout.&lt;br /&gt;The presentation of this brush is beautiful. It comes in a really nice gift box that is intended to store the massager in. It feels good on your muscles and some pets seem to like a light brushing with it too (I lightly stroked my cat just to see if he&#x27;d enjoy it and he was definitely intrigued.) I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see the cellulite dissolve but after doing some research on using massagers and dry brushing it does seem to support getting rid of cellulite. I don&#x27;t have excessive cellulite to begin with but you should be drinking a lot of water while you use this (especially afterwards to flush out the fat and toxins.) The quality of his massager is nice and although it is a lot of work to massage with it if it works it is worth it!</li>
    <li> Yes although the box seemed fancy, it was a little odd that i didn&#x27;t receive the usual &amp;#34;paper work&amp;#34;-- usually about the product and confidant and maybe offers of other products. So the presentation of the product was a little let down. Used my massager today and it was nice. It seems a little flat but the nubs do their job basically. So far so good.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the purchase, it is a very good product and I love it!</li>
    <li> Very nice!  Perfect gift to someone you care about.  It&#x27;s heart shaped, and well made.  I can compare this to my Culpepper massager I bought in England years ago.  The nubbies and the back are made from wood and the strap is a nice thick cotton strap.  It&#x27;s packaged nicely as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great to keep in the shower and rub the back of the thighs!  I was provided this sample for an honest review.</li>
    <li> This massager feels great. Years ago my sister bought me a gift set that had a cellulite massager and gel, and it felt amazing. I wasnot able to find what she had bought and opted to buy this. I really enjoy it. Now I just need to find a good cream to use with it.</li>
    <li> I received this for testing.&lt;br /&gt;That said, I fell in love with this.&lt;br /&gt;The deep massage it gives feels wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is looking great.&lt;br /&gt;Packaged really nicely and it makes a great gift.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product that I plan on enjoying a long time.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. Its so relaxing on the body and helps massage and reduce cellulite. I have been using this from the past month and its become my daily routine to use it. This massager helps in blood circulation and a healthy figure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the packaging as it comes in a beautifully packed box. It will make for a very nice gift. The bristles are smooth and does not feel rough on the body. Its water proof so the water doesn&#x27;t seep into the bristles and is very durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample received at discount or no cost for honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I have a big butt and I cannot lie! Cellulites are my worst enemey and Ive been searching for other ways of reducing its appearance other than exercise. The brush is very comfortable to hold and the nubs are very smoothe and comfortable on the skin. I hope it works (only time will tell), I have tried dry brushing brushes for cellulites and I think it was a bit abrasive on the skin. I have recently started to use this brush with a cellulite cream by Body Merry, the combination seems well. As soon as I see visible results I will be sure to post. The only con I can think about thus far is that the brush is too expensive and shipping was a pocket buster!&lt;br /&gt;Ps. I was not paid to review.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Not sure if it &amp;#34;works&amp;#34;, but it certainly can&#x27;t hurt to help circulation.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Lovely design and packaging.  Moderate pressure is all that&#x27;s needed - too much pressure will cauase bruising.  An attractive addition to my bathroom doo-dahs.  And feels nice as a back massager too.</li>
    <li> Nice box,,, Been using for a few weeks and see a decrease in cellulite appearance. However I use it dry and it&#x27;s still comfortable.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it actually helps reduce cellulite but it sure feels good trying!!</li>
    <li> Note: I received this product for free in exchange for a fair and honest review. I review all products as if I paid full price for it. Price of this massager at time of review is $19.99 from Amazon. This product was used with the Bodishape Cellulite Cream With Retinol and Caffeine - Guaranteed Fast Acting Body Firming Treatment selling for $22.20 on Amazon, which I also received for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My significant other was really excited to try this product after I was contacted to review it. She actually has very little cellulite, but she jumped at the opportunity to potentially decrease it further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her initial impressions were that the massager is of good quality and well-made. She particularly liked that it was heart-shaped and easy to hold--she has been using it in the shower for the last few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She appreciates that the massager feels like a good deep massage. The Bodishape Cellulite Cream makes the massage smoother as it allows for the massager to glide across the surface of the skin significantly better. Lotion can probably be an adequate substitute for facilitating the massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as results go, it cannot be determined yet after only a few weeks of use. Again, there was not too much cellulite to begin with, but there is no permanent discernible change in appearance thus far. Your mileage may vary. She will continue to use this product simply because she likes the way it feels. I will update this review if we find any benefits or problems after long-term use.</li>
    <li> Totally  disappointed with this Massager. I bought  this because other customers gave it good reviews. I saw no reduction of my cellulite.</li>
    <li> I have had my share of cellulite massagers but none of them looked as good, felt as great or was effective as this one.  The shape of the massager was just right to comfortably fit in my hand.  The hand strap kept the massager firmly in place while I worked the various areas of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1: Beautifully packaged that makes it such that it is appropriate for gift giving&lt;br /&gt;2: Heart-shaped form that fits comfortably in your hand&lt;br /&gt;3: Hand strap ensures you don&#x27;t drop the massager in the shower&lt;br /&gt;4: Made of beautiful wood that is 100% water proof&lt;br /&gt;5: Soft wooden nubs feel fantastic while working the various areas of your body&lt;br /&gt;6: Helps increase blood circulation&lt;br /&gt;7: Removes toxins&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a cream with this massager (Bodishape Cellulite Cream With Retinol and Caffeine sold on Amazon as well), and fell in love with both the massager and the cream.  The combination of both made me feel like I had just gotten an expensive spa treatment instead of just a massage in the convenience of my own home.  I am not sure if my cellulite will disappear completely if I continue to use these products but frankly that matters little to me.  What does matter is that I feel invigorated, alive and even just a little &#x27;sexier&#x27; after using this product.  And that is what makes this product a sure winner in my eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE : Product received to test with the option to review. No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned. I reserve 4 and 5 star ratings for products I would either recommend to others or buy for myself. This is a great product that I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s large enough to fit your entire hand, the center is flexible like a soft brush so the wooden pegs are able to move and adapt to your body shape.&lt;br /&gt;You can press hard and massage with out pain since they are on a giving base.&lt;br /&gt;The wooden pegs are well sanded so even on bare skin they are soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my only wish would be that the hand strap were either elastic or adjustable as it&#x27;s large for my hand and serves no purpose as is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a promotional discount on this product, however, my reviews are always honest and unbiased regardless of price I paid.</li>
    <li> This cellulite massager mitt is a very well made product. I have used others and none that I have had in the past were made from wood and had strapes to keep from slipping out of your hand...this one does! The massager mitt feels very soothing to my tired skin.  I use this along with Bodisure cellulite cream @http://www.amazon.com/Bodishape-Cellulite-Cream-Retinol-Caffeine/dp/B00DCF7QW0/. I personally feel that it is working, although the truth will be told this summer when I actually put on a pair of shorts for the first time in a while! It makes my skin feel so soft. The nodules on the mitt are so soft, not like other brands that have plastic nodules. It is packaged beautifully &amp; comes with a storage pouch....that&#x27;s microfiber. I received this at a discount for my honest opinion &amp; in my own personal opinion....I feel that this mitt is a great product for circulation &amp; cellulitic conditions ~ in or out of the shower!💧💧💧🚿🚿🚿🚿🚿🚿🚿🚿</li>
    <li> I have been using the BodiSure Cellulite Massager feels great. I have been using it in the shower for a week now. The massage feels great really helps with my legs feeling tired and my skin is smoother. It appears that cellulite is already smoothing out. With continued use I can see can see even more improvement. I use  a moisturizer when I get out to try to help as well. I received this for free or a reduced price but the above is my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I was sent this product for testing and review purposes. I already have their cellulite cream and LOVE it so it only made sense that they have a massage mitt that goes with it. The nubs are not hard they&#x27;re made out of some sort of resin so they bend and curve just enough so its not painful. I apply about 2 tbsp of the cream onto my upper thighs and begin to use the mitt in small circles then again going up and down. Its very soothing and great if you have a partner that is willing to use a little body oil and use it on your back. Tried, Tested and Approved!</li>
    <li> Everrything looks the same.</li>
