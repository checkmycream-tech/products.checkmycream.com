      <li>I love how it defines my curls.</li>
      <li>I like the way Chicks leave-in smells better than Silk.</li>
      <li>I also love when people ask me what I used.  </li>
      <li>I love the tons of compliments and stares</li>
      <li>So glad the Sally&#x27;s rep recommended it.</li>
      <li>Love how this makes my hair feel</li>
      <li>I love the smell.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
      <li>I love it for my wash and go&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>and I feel this works even better.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had the need to buy the shampoo yet :)    </li>
      <li>The first day Silk is kind of strong, but it does fade and smells fine after.    </li>
      <li>It started out working fine on my hair.</li>
      <li>He is multiracial and has the fine, curly hair.</li>
      <li>and could&#x27;t believe that this would be taken off the shelf for consumers when this was such a great product for my hair</li>
      <li>The amazing part about is, you don&#x27;t need a whole lot of it.</li>
      <li>My next day curls look great after I reapply a bit of the leave-in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Most leave in conditioners only smell great for the first 30 minutes after applying it.</li>
      <li>This is not only good for an leave in conditioner but for an detangler as well......</li>
      <li>With the detangling aspect of the product, it makes me happy because she&#x27;s extremely tender-headed.</li>
      <li>and I did get my moneys worth.</li>
      <li>Plus, it makes my hair soft and healthy looking.</li>
      <li>The price was worth it</li>
      <li>if I have to buy it online and pay shipping, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>These products did wonders for my hair and my curls were very defined and super coily.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite so far and the price beats the high end brands.  </li>
      <li>I use very little and its amazing !</li>
      <li>I will never be able to get Mixed Chicks because the price is unimaginable to me.</li>
      <li>Well first off I want to say I tried to buy this from two separate Sally&#x27;s locations and all of it was sold out.</li>
      <li>This product, to me, feels better than mixed chicks.</li>
      <li>which isn&#x27;t something even Chicks accomplished!</li>
      <li>What I really loved more about Silk is that the next day when I dampen my hair my curls were seperate and tame</li>
      <li>Nothing out there has been able to take its place except slightly Long Term Relationship by herbal essence, but that isn&#x27;t stopping my hair from falling out.</li>
      <li>I let air dry and at night I do a pineapple (flip hair over, tie hair so that when I stand up again all my hair settles on top of my hair).  </li>
      <li>Depending how much hair you have, the product does cover quite a bit of hair.</li>
      <li>and I really need a product that will soften and leave my mane nourished.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of hair that is curly, sometimes straight, sometimes bushy.</li>
      <li>it  was like silkkkkkkkkkk and very moisturized.</li>
      <li>That upset me, but I really wanted to try it</li>
      <li>and I did not need to use too much of it</li>
      <li>It is essential to my curls and my second day curls turn out nice.  </li>
      <li>I can actually go a day or two longer without having to comb out my hair which is stellar!!     </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure for a lot of other people&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>Hair felt relatively good with the product in but it left tons of residue in the form of tiny white specks which look like dandruff.  </li>
      <li>and if you like Mixed Chicks, you will really enjoy Mixed Silk for half the price and more product!    </li>
      <li>was everything i wanted and more then half the price.</li>
      <li>When I started to use Mixed Silk &amp; wear my hair curly all the time may hair started to get stronger &amp; grow quickly.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think ya&#x27;ll understand how much I am hurting for Mixed Silk right now.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about it at first because it looks so different than all the other gels I have ever used (LA Looks, Suave)</li>
      <li>I use the deep conditioning for my kids, and the knots literally slip right out, which did impress me.</li>
      <li>I was hooked on Mixed Chicks upon first use.</li>
      <li>I am glad I only spent $7 on this product because I WONT be using it ANYMORE!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t forget to section your hair into 4 sections and rake about 3 pumps (long hair) worth of product into each section.</li>
      <li>The cheaper conditioner I usually use works much better.</li>
      <li>Both products together make my hair really soft, not hard, not greasy and not flaky.</li>
      <li>She has 4 b hair, and I just love the way it makes her hair so soft, less frizz, and shiney!No white flecks whatsover.</li>
      <li>if you are trying to decide, spend a little more and get the \\&quot;Mixed</li>
      <li>As far as the shampoo, I wouldn&#x27;t know bc</li>
      <li>, I am transitioning to natural (curly) hair</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not heavy or sticky.</li>
      <li>This leave in was recommended for use on natural curls</li>
      <li>I wish I could find some old stock somewhere.</li>
      <li>Initially I used the same amnt of leave-in Silk as I was use to with Chicks, however it was the second time around when I used an extra pump per sectioned hair that I got better results than I did with Mixed Chicks</li>
      <li>At the end of the day I highly recommend this, and the girls in my family has switched to Mixed Silk!</li>
      <li>and it left my hair feeling so soft and gave my hair such volume.</li>
      <li>I am a african american woman with  natural hair .</li>
      <li>The first time I used it had left my hair crunchy and the next day I saw little white specks.</li>
      <li>Actually, to test the difference, last week I used my old gel, and it left my hair dry</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It started out working fine on my hair. After a while it left my hair too frizzy and at times unmanageable.</li>
    <li> From reading the reviews I thought I was getting a mixed chicks product without the price. this product was lovely, smelled nice, and placed in my hair nicely.HOWEVER, it left white specks in my hair and it was VERY unpleasant. I am glad I only spent $7 on this product because I WONT be using it ANYMORE!</li>
    <li> Well first off I want to say I tried to buy this from two separate Sally&#x27;s locations and all of it was sold out. That upset me, but I really wanted to try it so I decided to buy it online. I AM HAPPY I did! This product, to me, feels better than mixed chicks. It feels lighter on my hair. I use it with Africa&#x27;s Best Organics Olive &amp; Clove Oil (a non greasy product). Both products together make my hair really soft, not hard, not greasy and not flaky. My hair looks like I have nothing in it and that it just falls perfectly.  I am so thankful I decided to look for an alternative to mixed chicks and I feel this works even better. Matter of fact, I still have some mixed chicks at home and I dont want to use it because I rather this product.  Thank you Sally&#x27;s! Also, It came a day before the quoted 5 day delivery dates, Great Service-thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I purchased this because a friend recommended it.  She said she thought it was a lot like Mixed Chicks.  I disagree.  It was heavy on my hair and didn&#x27;t leave it soft and manageable like mixed chicks does.</li>
    <li> I bought both the Shampoo and the Conditioner only because Sally&#x27;s said it was comparable to Mixed chicks.  Needless to say I didn&#x27;t like the Shampoo it left my hair brittle feeling and hard after I washed it, I am transitioning to natural (curly) hair and I really need a product that will soften and leave my mane nourished. I didn&#x27;t get that with the shampoo.    As for the conditioner I liked it! It didn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy. I attempted to do a braid out and let it dry over night. I did have to put a Sheen in it because it was a little dry.   However I am going to give this product a 1 star I am taking it back to Sally&#x27;s.  I am gonna try Beautiful Curls Shea Butter Crème Curl activator next.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and this product is wonderful! It&#x27;s not heavy or sticky. Plus, it makes my hair soft and healthy looking. It works great on my daughter&#x27;s hair as well. Her hair is thicker and coarser. With the detangling aspect of the product, it makes me happy because she&#x27;s extremely tender-headed. Her hair seems to soak up other products, but not with this.    Great price for a great product! So glad the Sally&#x27;s rep recommended it.</li>
    <li> I am a african american woman with  natural hair . I have recently purchased this product. I usually wear my hair in braids or kinky twist. So when it comes time for me to take my hair down i have alot of product build up and my hair is extremly dry.  I figured i should give this product a try. I did and when i took down my  hair it  was like silkkkkkkkkkk and very moisturized. Im sooooooo happy i made the decision to use this product..... This is not only good for an leave in conditioner but for an detangler as well...... this product gets an A+. Thank god for silk elements mixed silk leave in conditioner. Have a blessed day..</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.  It is essential to my curls and my second day curls turn out nice.  I have 3c curly hair and this is my procedure: After wash or cowash, I SATURATE my hair with this leave-in.  I section my hair and comb through each section with a wide-tooth comb.  I then use the Silk Element curly gel.  I apply by sectioning hair again, this time I skip the comb and use my fingers to style.  I let air dry and at night I do a pineapple (flip hair over, tie hair so that when I stand up again all my hair settles on top of my hair).  My next day curls look great after I reapply a bit of the leave-in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tried using other leave-in treatments since moisture is key to curly hair.  This is my favorite so far and the price beats the high end brands.  The gel is wonderful.  I wasn&#x27;t sure about it at first because it looks so different than all the other gels I have ever used (LA Looks, Suave) but it works great with the leave in.  Actually, to test the difference, last week I used my old gel, and it left my hair dry so I went back to this product.</li>
    <li> I love it for my wash and go&#x27;s. I love the smell. I love how it defines my curls. I love the tons of compliments and stares I get. I also love when people ask me what I used.  The curls for me are a bit tight on the 1st day but the 2nd day the curls loosen up and looks like tiny ringlets. I do add oil for my hair is black . The oil makes it shiny with the supreme definition that I get from mixed silk. I never tried mixed chicks.  Keep selling it Sally&#x27;s .and it smells great! I think my hair type is 4a</li>
    <li> The first time I used it had left my hair crunchy and the next day I saw little white specks. My hair feels dry and dull.  It didn&#x27;t moisturize my hair what so ever. The cheaper conditioner I usually use works much better. I would not recommend this to anyone I know. FYI: I have 3C curls.</li>
    <li> I have never reviewed anything, but I have to put my word on this leave in! it is awesome! I have been using it for the past 5 weeks on my daughters hair, and I have to say, soft, sily, manageble hair everytime. She has 4 b hair, and I just love the way it makes her hair so soft, less frizz, and shiney!No white flecks whatsover. I will be buying this product for as long as they make it!</li>
    <li> I was hooked on Mixed Chicks upon first use. Both of my girls and I have extremely curly hair (we are hispanic, caucasian, as well as native american mixed) and if you like Mixed Chicks, you will really enjoy Mixed Silk for half the price and more product!    Initially I used the same amnt of leave-in Silk as I was use to with Chicks, however it was the second time around when I used an extra pump per sectioned hair that I got better results than I did with Mixed Chicks believe it or not! Don&#x27;t forget to section your hair into 4 sections and rake about 3 pumps (long hair) worth of product into each section. I like the way Chicks leave-in smells better than Silk. The first day Silk is kind of strong, but it does fade and smells fine after.    I use the deep conditioning for my kids, and the knots literally slip right out, which did impress me. This deep conditioner isn&#x27;t better or worse than Chicks brand, but it does cost about half the price! Personally I deep condition twice a week, however I do leave it in my hair with a cap on for roughly an hour. Some say the Silk isn&#x27;t hydrating enough, but with the deep conditioning being left on I think it makes up for it.    As far as the shampoo, I wouldn&#x27;t know bc we go through a bottle of shampoo for all of us in about 6 months, so I haven&#x27;t had the need to buy the shampoo yet :)    What I really loved more about Silk is that the next day when I dampen my hair my curls were seperate and tame which isn&#x27;t something even Chicks accomplished! I can actually go a day or two longer without having to comb out my hair which is stellar!!     At the end of the day I highly recommend this, and the girls in my family has switched to Mixed Silk!</li>
    <li> Hair felt relatively good with the product in but it left tons of residue in the form of tiny white specks which look like dandruff.  ugh! if you are trying to decide, spend a little more and get the \\&quot;Mixed Chicks\\&quot; - it works beautifully!</li>
    <li> I purchased this products shampoo and the leave-in conditioner for my son&#x27;s hair. He is multiracial and has the fine, curly hair. When I was running low on my products I decided to try a little of his. OMGoodness!! These products did wonders for my hair and my curls were very defined and super coily. I had no problems detangling my hair too. However, I can only wash my hair once with the shampoo and use very little of it or makes my hair feel sticky like when rinsing it out. That&#x27;s my only complaint. Then I use the leave-in and it makes my wash n go look great and I am seven months post BC. Love how this makes my hair feel and I wet my hair and apply the conditoner daily and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  Will buy more soon!</li>
    <li> Works wonders for my daughter who is half black and white , my husband even loves it ! I use very little and its amazing ! I will be purchasing again .</li>
    <li> Ive been using this product for over a year now and absolutely LOVE IT!!!! Ive never tried the mixed chicks brand becuase this knock off was everything i wanted and more then half the price. Im DEVESTATED that I can not find this anywhere now becuase of the lawsuit between sallys and mixed chicks. If anyone can find this sold anywhere please comment and let me know!!! I will miss this product and i know my curls wont be the same without it...</li>
    <li> This leave in was recommended for use on natural curls so I ordered it. It has a nice consistency to it. I like that it has a pump to control how the product can be dispensed.</li>
    <li> I love this product! My hair was dull and very damaged before I started using this product. After shopping for a leave in conditioner at Sally&#x27;s, I came across the Silk Elements leave in conditioner. The clerk who helped me recommended this product and even said it had a great smell. She even opened it for me and when I took a sniff, I already loved it. This smell is unbelievably amazing. Most leave in conditioners only smell great for the first 30 minutes after applying it. Not this one, this product last all day and it left my hair feeling so soft and gave my hair such volume. The amazing part about is, you don&#x27;t need a whole lot of it. Depending how much hair you have, the product does cover quite a bit of hair. I myself have thick long hair and I did not need to use too much of it so the bottle lasted me a long time. The price was worth it and I did get my moneys worth. The sad thing was, when I recently went to Sally&#x27;s to purchase another bottle, they said they had not gotten this product back into the store and that this product might be discontinued. I was so upset and could&#x27;t believe that this would be taken off the shelf for consumers when this was such a great product for my hair and I&#x27;m sure for a lot of other people&#x27;s hair. I just hope that this isn&#x27;t the case and I can soon purchase this amazing leave in conditioner. I don&#x27;t even mind if I have to buy it online and pay shipping, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think ya&#x27;ll understand how much I am hurting for Mixed Silk right now. This product changed my life. I have a lot of hair that is curly, sometimes straight, sometimes bushy. My hair is confused &amp; because I didn&#x27;t know what to do with it it started to fall out. When I started to use Mixed Silk &amp; wear my hair curly all the time may hair started to get stronger &amp; grow quickly. It made my hair shiny and moist for days. It was the best thing that ever happened to me. Now that I can&#x27;t find it any where my hair is falling out again. Nothing out there has been able to take its place except slightly Long Term Relationship by herbal essence, but that isn&#x27;t stopping my hair from falling out. I will never be able to get Mixed Chicks because the price is unimaginable to me. I have a lot of hair and the amount they sell for those prices would be the dumbest choice for me to make. SO somebody, anybody PLEASE GET ME MY MIXED SILK. I AM GOING NUTS WITHOUT IT!!!</li>
    <li> This worked great for me.  I have 100% kinky Black hair.  Mixed chicks does not work for me.  Seems a shame that it is now off the market because Mixed&lt;br /&gt;Chicks won a law suit against them.  I wish I could find some old stock somewhere.</li>
