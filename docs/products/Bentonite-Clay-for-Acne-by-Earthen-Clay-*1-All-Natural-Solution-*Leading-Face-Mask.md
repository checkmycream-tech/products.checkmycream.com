      <li>Works better than the old version, but still tastes just OK....</li>
      <li>My pores felt so clean and cleared of crud after I removed it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is really good for me its works cleaning my face I do once a week but since I don&#x27;t have acne anymore I have to stop but i guess its better to do this once for 2 weeks to keep my face clean too.</li>
    <li> I love this clay!!  You have so many options to mix with and it makes your skin feel clean and revitalized after using. I have noticed a difference in my complexion after just 2 uses!!</li>
    <li> This Bentonite clay mask works amazingly well. I mix it with Braggs vinegar. The result was clean and smooth feeling skin. It really helped clean out my pores. I definitely recommend this to anyone who has a blackhead or acne problem.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have used.</li>
    <li> I actually use this to occasionally wash my very thin hair. I know that that is not what it is for, but it works and &amp;#34;poufs&amp;#34; up my hair. Also a great facial product. Recommend!</li>
    <li> This product will definitely last a long time! I made too much at first but just stored it for another use (wish the container would say how much it mix up). This product made my skin feel so soft and smooth just after one use! I have been using it for about a month and my pores are smaller and I have less breakouts. Whenever I had a new breakout, I would put this on it and it would dry it up and be gone sooner than when I didn&#x27;t use this. I really like this product!</li>
    <li> I was given a trial sample of this product, and I&#x27;m actually really happy with it. The first time I used it, I put the clay on for 15 minutes, and after I took off the mask my face felt very smooth, much more so than usual. Overall, VERY pleased with this product and excited to continue using it.</li>
    <li> This tub is huge! And I used 3 teaspoons to cover my whole face! Now, the directions said you would feel pulling, but i did not. I did feel tingling. Mask took a good 25 minutes, and it came off easily with a face cloth. I didn&#x27;t see an immediate difference in my pores, but my face felt soft!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed this product. It does feel a little different at first on my skin but the results are amazing. It makes my skin clear and soft. Love it! I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT FOR PREVENTION AND DRYING UP CURRENT ACNE!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this clay for about a week, and have already started noting positive results!&lt;br /&gt;The mask feels amazing.  You can feel it pulling all the crud out. My son uses it as well and has seen a significant improvement in his skin color (not so red) and the acne has lessened quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this clay!</li>
    <li> Turned my skin bright red and swollen.</li>
    <li> I got this for my teenage son. It is amazing stuff. He suffers from mild acne and has used this product many times. It leaves his face clean smooth and significantly reduces acne. It has boost his self esteem and its way better than the other acne products that we have spent tons of money on.</li>
    <li> I in my youth did not have problems with acne But as ive gotten older I&#x27;ve become very sensitive.  I am limited in what a can use. I just started using this mask and have not had any reactions but positive.  Glad to have made the purchase.</li>
    <li> So I was a bit skeptical when I received this product after agreeing to review it. I thought this would be like any other mask but I was pleasantly surprised. I could feel my face tingling after having the mask on for 10 minutes. I rinsed it off after 18 minutes and I was totally amazed at how clear my skin looked! I literally said &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; out loud twice! Amazing product. I would absolutely purchase this product again. And the huge jar lasts forever and has a five year shelf life. Amazing!!! I received this item at a deeply discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Great product! Made my skin feel so smooth.  I have always been very particular about my skin and I love the this product.  Also great customer service and shipping was fast!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this product, it is well worth the money! Works great, has cleared almost all of my sons acne up in a week. I will defintely  be buying more of this.</li>
    <li> great product. My mom is loving it. She uses it every night.</li>
    <li> I can always tell when it&#x27;s about time for my little friend to arrive because I break out and my daughter suffers the same way so I was very excited to try this product.  I&#x27;ve tried all the expensive acne systems and various cleansers with little success but I could actually feel the Earthen clay working.  It clears up my acne within days and leaves my skin feeling moisturized and hydrated. almost like I&#x27;ve had an expensive facial.  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying another jar because my daughter has staked her claim on mine.  I would definitely recommend this for anyone who suffers from acne in any form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review. I was not compensated for my review and the opinions are 100% my own. One may or may not have the same results as myself when using this product. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission’s 16 CFR, Part 255: Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift. They love it.</li>
    <li> I love this! It feels so good on your face! I even got my boyfriend to try it with me and we both loved it! We also enjoyed mixing it together :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been recently plagued with acne worse than I&#x27;ve ever had in my life; in new places on my forehead, cheeks, and chin! The kind of zits that sit really deep under my skin and hurt. Looks more like I&#x27;m sprouting horns than going through some weird post teenage acne phase. And I can&#x27;t pop them. When I try to, I end up with a crater on my face. It&#x27;s a never ending cycle of acne despair. My blackheads are also quite terrible. I needed something that wouldn&#x27;t irritate or overdry my combination skin. It gets dry easily and then gets really oily. Gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is like miracle dirt. It is a fine powder that you mix yourself. It&#x27;s amazing and feels wonderful and tingly and ultra cleansing. Take that, acne! I have only been using it for a week or so, but can already see results. My break outs are less frequent and my face looks healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I follow up with a blackhead removing strip (the mask seems to make those more effective due to opening my pores!) and bio oil. It&#x27;s light, non greasy and helps with the scars too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great that you can mix it yourself, but I am giving it one less star because of how messy it gets! I also had a really hard time finding the right balance of water and clay powder. You have to gradually mix it so it isn&#x27;t so clumpy. I also keep making too much, as the tub doesn&#x27;t provide any measurements other than equal parts water or Apple cider vinegar to powder. I also am unsure of how to thick to apply it, but I think just enough that it will dry in the 15 minutes seems about right. I applied it too thin once and it pulled my skin really tight and hurt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to keep using it and get my face back!</li>
    <li> Just got it today lets see how it works</li>
    <li> My son had minor acne but since using earthen clay his flare-ups severely lessened.  His pores are not clogged and his skin is showing overall improvement.  Will continue to use.  Delighted with the overall results!</li>
    <li> Great for hair and face!</li>
    <li> I have horrible acne, and I saw this and purchased it with a discount. I was doubtful about it working, and thought it would irritate my sensitive skin. Thankfully I was wrong! This clay mask is amazing. It comes in a &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34; and you mix it with water or apple cider vinegar. (I used water). Apply. Wait. And rinse off. You can feel it tightening when it is on. My pores felt so clean and cleared of crud after I removed it. It did not irritate my skin. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I used the product as soon as it came in. My face has never felt more smooth or clean. Alot of reviews I read stated that the mask became tight or made their face red. I did not experience any of that, yes it was a little tight as it dried but nothing unbearable. I will be using this again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a friend of mine.  Her son has really bad back acne. She is thrilled with the results they are seeing.</li>
    <li> I am rating with 4 stars because the product ultimately didn&#x27;t work for me unfortunately, but I think it&#x27;s a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Straight out powder clay, with no additives, preservatives, and you do not have to wonder what&#x27;s in it.&lt;br /&gt;You can mix it your own- find your recipe&lt;br /&gt;No scent&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful customer service (will refund you if the product doesn&#x27;t work for you)&lt;br /&gt;It does its job, leaving your skin very smooth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Messy&lt;br /&gt;Instruction says to mix with apple cider vinegar- I felt the scent of vinegar was overwhelming&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little to know how much you need to cover your entire face.  I think I wasted a lot of product trying to figure this out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s great product, especially if you are picky about your ingredients, or crafty type... you can pick your own with this one.  I keep a very busy schedule, and I feel there are other masks I would prefer to use that are pre-mixed, great for a lazy person like myself.</li>
    <li> I loved this product and how it worked during the use. Had a blind pimple that would never pop then I saw the changes and my skin feels smooth and fresh. Mix with apple cider vinegar is the best.</li>
    <li> I wish I knew about this clay face mask years ago, I would have saved myself hundreds of dollars trying one acne product after another. This is my holy grail acne product. In love!!!</li>
    <li> This is a very good purchase--glad to have natural clay on hand.</li>
    <li> This worked really great for me! My skin was red at first but now it looks really good and my pores are much smaller. I am very excited to have found this stuff!</li>
    <li> As a young man without acne, I bought this for the purposes of rejuvenating my face and feeling fresher.. It worked! The clay was extremely easy to use and apply, and the effects I felt afterward were astonishing. I have used similar (but much pricier) products from expensive boutique stores that guaranteed exceptional results, but honestly Earthen Clay was superior in achieving the same goal. My face feels fantastic, and my girlfriend says I look younger and more vibrant.</li>
    <li> Quality product, you can really feel it working on your skin.  Skin feels/looks very healthy afterwards.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> This mask is amazing. It&#x27;s a little weird to adjust to the idea of mixing you own mask but it actually makes a lot of sense if you think abo it it. Not having stabilizers or liquid to keep it in its goopy form makes it way more potent. After you mix it and put it on it is one of the most powerful feeling masks I&#x27;ve ever felt. It really tightens and almost feels like it&#x27;s pulling all of the bad stuff out of your skin. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it over Dermalogica&#x27;s Sebum Clearing Mask which I used to use and costs 3 times as much. Definitely prevents breakouts. Like any mask, if you have sensitive skin definitely use a good moisturizer after.</li>
    <li> I have very acne prone skin and am trying to get on a more natural skin care regimen. I used by mixing with apple cider vinegar as recommended, and after only one use I am very happy with the results! The blackheads are totally gone from around my nose and the texture of my skin is more even and less oily. Can&#x27;t wait to keep using! An amazing value, definitely will continue to buy this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times and can see a difference. It&#x27;s a large amount of clay and will last a very long time. I&#x27;ve used it on my face and as an under arm detox. Great natural product!</li>
    <li> I mixed the clay with some overly fermented kombucha vinegar (produced when you forget your kombucha batch for too long).  It felt very nice on my face.  I have not used it often enough to determine if it actually helps with my acne, but I do like the product.</li>
    <li> It works. It does exactly what it says....usually I&#x27;d purchase a item and I kinda does what it describes...but this..I seen a difference with just 3days of use.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> I love Earthen Clay! It&#x27;s very easy to mix with apple cider vinegar and easy to apply. Makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. I.am very pleased.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little different to have my masks come in powder form instead of being already made for you. It is messy and kind of hard to figure out the right measurements to make it just right. However once put on, you can actually feel it working and tightening your face. I would recommend that those with sensitive skin leave it on slightly less time. My skin is very sensitive and was bright red at first, but later thankfully went back to its normal state. It did make acne pop up, but I know that products like this draw out the dirt and impurities sometimes making more acne before actually getting rid of the acne. I have not yet tried to make this mask with apple cider vinegar but I will definitely try it. Another benefit is that this a lot of product and can easily last a whole year. Definitely your money&#x27;s worth. * I got this product for a low cost in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Works better than the old version, but still tastes just OK....</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic for oily skin!</li>
    <li> Works great. My face looks really clear and healthy!</li>
    <li> I have had black heads for as long as I can remember, and literally nothing has gotten rid of them.  I have used Proactive, Nutrogena, and various others.  But after just a few uses of Earthen Clay they are gone.  Oh, and the pulling sensation that the clay makes as it dries is very satisfying.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! Shrinks my pores and leaves my face looking amazing</li>
    <li> I have had problems with acne since I was a teenager. Ive tried SOOO many products (over the counter AND prescription) to try to combat this. Most just break my face out worse. So far, this earthen clay has done an amazing job of pulling out the dirt and keeping my pores clear so they dont form new breakouts, but its also diminishing the size of the existing ones. As a 33 year old, its better late than never to find SOMETHING that will work to control my skin.</li>
    <li> This Earthen Clay is AMAZING! You mix the amount you need at the time so there is no issue of it drying out like the expensive premixed kind. The jar is HUGE so it&#x27;ll last a very long time even when sharing for a girls night in. The mask feels so good when it&#x27;s on with no burning. After rinsing your face is a little red but is not uncomfortable and leaves your face feeling great! I really recommend this product for everyone with acne. It&#x27;s such a fantastic product and a great value.</li>
    <li> Hopefully I am posting this seller review in the right area. I wanted to express my high regard for Tyler, from Earthen Clay, who reached out to me after purchasing the product. It was a nice change to have the seller personally contact you following up on my purchase. I shows how important customer service is for this company.I personally loved this product and noticed a difference in my skins texture immediately after using. It left my skin feeling clean and soft and tight. I would highly recommend this product and this company.</li>
    <li> Great beauty product.</li>
    <li> This mask is amazing! I find it fun mixing my own mask when I need it. This stuff cleans out my pores like nothing else! You can definitely feel it working as it gets tingly and tight but not uncomfortable while drying. I use this weekly and have been getting great results!</li>
    <li> This is a nice clay for Acne. My friend&#x27;s daughter who is in high school is suffering acne problem. I gave this clay to her so she see if this will help her daughter&#x27;s skin condition. A week later, she tells me that the clay is pretty easy to mix up, and just 15 minutes every other day, she starts to see some visible good result. Her daughter&#x27;s face pores are clean up and less redness and acne on her face. It really helps a lot. Her daughter is so happy and the clay doesn&#x27;t really give him redness or breakout. It actually feels nice and clean after use.&lt;br /&gt;I got this clay at a discount in exchange for my honest review. My friend&#x27;s daughter prove this message that the clay works great.</li>
    <li> Works great on acne prone skin. Just be aware that it takes at least 45 minutes of sitting in a container before you can use it, I make a batch and let it sit overnight, I&#x27;ve found the consistency to be easiest to work with after about 2 days of sitting. Then I just scoop it out with a sterile PLASTIC spoon (don&#x27;t want to use metal at all with this) and apply. It does make my face red after use but I read that that reaction is normal since the blood vessels dilate to let all the toxins out to be drawn into the mask. I&#x27;ve gotta say, I&#x27;m pretty pleased with this product. It actually works really well (I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was all hype - saw it on TV) and a little goes a long way. It&#x27;ll probably take me a couple years to work my way through this as a mask but I read about taking detox baths with this as well so who knows how long it will last me. Surprised that there&#x27;s an expiration date on it but it says 2016. I&#x27;ll have to try the baths before it expires.</li>
    <li> I mean what can I say other than I love it?!? I LOVE face masks. Thats my mommy time. This certainly takes the cake. Good smell. So peaceful, relaxing, and exciting knowing that then you wash it off you will see a difference in your skin. It evens everything out. Dry skin...gone. Oily skin...gone. Pimples and blackheads...gone. wrinkles/fine lines...improving.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my acne, but my skin is so incredibly soft. I&#x27;m happy I have used this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this clay for about a week, and have already started noting positive results! Other clays I&#x27;ve used have been much rougher on the skin, this product seems to dry in a way that leads to less facial irritation. Would recommend this high-end clay!</li>
    <li> This bentonite clay is wonderful for acne - and also many other skin conditions.  It tightens my pores and makes my skin feel cleaner.  I am so glad I started using bentonite clay on my skin!  Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I really like the tightness of this mask and it felt like it was really pulling things out and working!  My only issue was that it was really hard to get off of my skin.  Usually if you put a warm washrag on to loosen it up and wipe a mask off, that&#x27;s all it takes, but I really had to scrub to get it off and it kind of hurt.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I feel like it worked really well.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works exactly as described!</li>
    <li> Just got it in the mail. It is exactly what they said it would be. Can&#x27;t wait to try it out</li>
