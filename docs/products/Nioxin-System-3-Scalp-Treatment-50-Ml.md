      <li>This is a great product, just can&#x27;t always afford to buy it.</li>
      <li>happy with the results</li>
      <li>I already use the product and I was looking for a multipack and, of course, good pricing.</li>
      <li>My hair seems to be thicker and fuller and much more managable.</li>
      <li>best prices we found were only on amazon.</li>
      <li>Love Nioxin brand item.</li>
      <li>glad I discovered Nioxin</li>
      <li>But it arrived quickly and pacakged nicely</li>
      <li>Again there was the issue with postage, thinking I was getting free postage for my order</li>
      <li>H&amp;H filled the bill.</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;m thinking it works good</li>
      <li>, now im able to take care of my sculpt and on top of that hair loss is very less.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really ordered more than I wanted.</li>
      <li>This product has helped my fine thin hair look thicker and fuller with much more body, I am very pleased with the outcome.</li>
      <li>It was reasonable priced and arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this for anyone who wants full looking hair with body.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product 3 weeks from now; and really I have noticed that hair is not falling the way it used to do before.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I enjoy massaging this into just the hairline only.</li>
      <li>and I expected better from the nioxin line.</li>
      <li>I really saw no difference while using this</li>
      <li>While my hair is not thick, it has stopped falling out as much and is growing much faster than it ever has.</li>
      <li>Live and learn to pay attention.&lt;br /&gt;Many</li>
      <li>I like this better then the Rogaine mousse because it is easier to apply directly to my scalp and not as messy as the mousse.  </li>
      <li>It did not work for me at all ,make my scalp mor sensitive ...</li>
      <li>but I sense there is slight growth using the full array of products</li>
      <li>I am on my third week of using this daily and I am seeing new hair growth where my hairline is receding.  </li>

<li> and I use it every other washing.  </li>
<li> It would be easier to apply and not drip down my forehead.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over 45 days and my hair has stopped falling out.  </li>
<li> will update again in a few months --</li>
<li> Been using it for a few years now, won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
<li> Not sure this did anything.  </li>
<li> I used to buy it at the salon I go to, but lately they haven&#x27;t been stocking it, so I turned to Amazon.</li>
<li> I thought myhair seemed worse</li>
<li> I&#x27;d be hard pressed to find a bad thing to say about this product.  </li>
<li> This is too expensive too.</li>
<li> This crap made in Mexico</li>
