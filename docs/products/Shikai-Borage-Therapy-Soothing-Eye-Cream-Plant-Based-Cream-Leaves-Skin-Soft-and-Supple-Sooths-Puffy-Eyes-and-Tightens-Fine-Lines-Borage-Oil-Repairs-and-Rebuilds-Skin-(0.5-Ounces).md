      <li>Well, the reviews are accurate because this is the best eye cream ever....</li>
      <li>This is a good eye cream, but I also think it compares to the Oil of Olay one I get at Target..</li>

      <li>Good under makeup.  </li>
      <li>I loved everything I bought from this line.</li>

      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>this is an amazing product that hydrates and reduces the lines.  </li>
      <li>This cream is amazing.</li>
      <li>Stays kind of tacky and makes me breakout a bit around my eye area</li>
      <li>Love this brand and using their body cream that I love, so thought it will be a great product too.  </li>
      <li>The pricing is reasonable and the product superb.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, I was.</li>
      <li>Leaves skin feeling nice.  </li>
      <li>I am so picky about my eye moisturizer, but really liked this one.  </li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s the best eye cream I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>Really best under-eye cream I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
      <li>It is also very light</li>
      <li>Umm honestly I have not noticed the fine lines decreasing (and I have been using this cream every day for 2 weeks now)</li>
      <li>I do not see any reduction in lines, but that&#x27;s ok.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad I did.  </li>
      <li>I love how this cream feels on my skin</li>
      <li>This eye lotion is mostly composed of water.</li>
      <li>Light and effective, wears well under make-up.</li>
      <li>I picked up another brand that was much more creamy and moisturizing: MyChelle-Cream-Fabulous-5-Ounce-Tube.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for super-duper age-defying magical product, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s unscented which I love since I can&#x27;t tolerate fragrances.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad that I found it</li>
      <li>Works a lot better than the $80+ creams I&#x27;ve used over the years.</li>
      <li>you get better quality..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, certainly better than nothing, but I just needed something with a bit more moisture.</li>
      <li>I love this cream.</li>
      <li>I choose this because I was looking for something more affordable compared to elta md&#x27;s eye gel</li>
      <li>but this product is more greasy.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes or anything and keeps them moisturized for most of the day.</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s better to use at night than in the morning before makeup.</li>
      <li>When I started using this, I was so pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>So why spend a fortune on some specialized product that isn&#x27;t gonna do much more than that.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Update.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not doing miracles, but it&#x27;s doing it for me :)</li>
      <li>I love the Borage eye cream.  </li>
      <li>I was also able to see the difference on her.</li>
      <li>I have used it for more than 2 month now, to tell the truth it does nothing</li>
      <li>so it won&#x27;t cause breakouts for those with more oily skin types.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t decide which one does more</li>
      <li>just the skin just soaks it right up, in a good way</li>
      <li>There is no scent to this cream which I love and application is easy.</li>
      <li>As with all of Shikai&#x27;s products, this is a wonderful, ick-free option for dry skin.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also GREAT for sensitive eyes!</li>
      <li>It does plump and make fine lines look better.  </li>
      <li>It is great for people with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>great eye moisturizer for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>The price of the cream is good for the amount of cream that you get, but it&#x27;s very runny.  </li>
      <li>Never irritating and a good cream, but just no miracle.</li>
      <li>But I do really love the fact that this cream is great for sensitive eyes and moisturizes at the same time (goes great under makeup, too).</li>
      <li>It smoothed my skin out very quickly.</li>
      <li>Easy for traveling.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not always true if you spend more</li>
      <li>And it feels pretty nice on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I could see an improvement with the fine lines under my eyes.  </li>
      <li>it is creamy and light and easy to spread/tap on eye area.</li>
      <li>my fine lines seem to have blurred out a bit.</li>
      <li>I even use it on the fine lines on my forehead and it doesn&#x27;t break me out.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>It has a slightly watery consistency and is probably best suited to daytime wear.</li>
      <li>My eyes are very sensitive and it caused no irritation, which is good.</li>
      <li>best use in night time since it&#x27;s a little oily under makeup.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make wrinkles disappear but my undereye area looks smooth and hydrated.</li>
      <li>fragrance free.</li>
      <li>But it doesn&#x27;t work as great after the formula changed (blue tube).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I read the reviews and had to try this.  I like the ingredients a lot.  My eyes feel very moisturized.  I do not see any reduction in lines, but that&#x27;s ok.  You don&#x27;t need much at all- if you use too much, it feels a tad greasy/slimy.</li>
    <li> Thie first time I used this eye cream I noticed a difference. I have trouble with puffy eyes and this was greatly diminished from the start. There is no scent to this cream which I love and application is easy. I will purchase this eye cream again</li>
    <li> Stays kind of tacky and makes me breakout a bit around my eye area but my skin is VERY oily and acne prone and most eye creams are the exact same way on me.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t sting or burn or make my eyes water.  It is hydrating but not deeply as it feels like it sits on top rather than sink into my skin.  It does plump and make fine lines look better.  No smell and it is creamy and light and easy to spread/tap on eye area.</li>
    <li> This cream goes on smoothly and keeps my skin hydrated all day.  I&#x27;ve tried a number of eye creams and this one is the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a definite improvement in my eye area since using this cream.  It doesn&#x27;t make wrinkles disappear but my undereye area looks smooth and hydrated. Also, it&#x27;s unscented which I love since I can&#x27;t tolerate fragrances.  So far it&#x27;s the best eye cream I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> At first I thought it&#x27;s a bit runny, but who cares?  My eyes look great which is a miracle.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin but this did not cause a reaction, even over time, it did what it was supposed to do: minimize puffiness and lines, moisturize.</li>
    <li> I read other reviews in the past where women made the excellent observation that eye cream isn&#x27;t supposed to be some kind of miracle worker. It is supposed to be soothing, protecting, and preventative (if possible) to aging skin around the eyes.  That&#x27;s it. So why spend a fortune on some specialized product that isn&#x27;t gonna do much more than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give this one a try and, so far, I&#x27;m really satisfied with it.  There has been no irritation, no swelling, no redness, itching or other negative side effects. It is not as thick as others I&#x27;ve tried in the past, but a little does go a very, very long way. And it feels pretty nice on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, there ya go.  For the price, this is an excellent choice to use as an eye cream.</li>
    <li> Sometimes you need a cream for the eyes that doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of miracle ingredients (that can sting and burn).  This cream is soothing and provides a lot of moisture yet it absorbs quickly enough to not travel into your eyes.  I wear contacts so that is important.</li>
    <li> This is a good eye cream, but I also think it compares to the Oil of Olay one I get at Target.. so good, but not amazing.</li>
    <li> The first time I purchased this eye cream was after reading reviews on this product and the Borage hand lotion. I am so glad I did.  I love the Borage eye cream.  I could see an improvement with the fine lines under my eyes.  I have tried several different eye creams and still have two other well-known brands.  I did an experiment. After using the Borage eye cream for a while, I went back to one of my other brands.  I use eye cream in the morning and in the evening.  The next day after using one of my other brands, the lines were more pronounced. The following day I used the Borage eye cream and saw an immediate improvement.  When I originally purchased the eye cream I ordered one for me and one for a friend.  My friend told me she felt she could see a difference under her eyes and was very happy with the eye cream. I was also able to see the difference on her.</li>
    <li> I have been using ShiKai Borage products for 2 years.  I live in Southern Nevada where it is pretty dry.  I have to say this product works.  I have silky smooth skin thanks to Borage!</li>
    <li> So far so good, can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s any different  than others I bought, but it can&#x27;t hurt to use it</li>
    <li> Love this brand and using their body cream that I love, so thought it will be a great product too.  But this cream is so watery, and it is in the tube so it is leaking as soon as you open the lid, it should be in a pump bottle.  I have used it for more than 2 month now, to tell the truth it does nothing, I see no improvement or anything, and very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I hate to \\&quot;review\\&quot; this product after only using it a week, but it&#x27;s so good that I just had to share my thoughts. I&#x27;m 24 with normal/combination skin, but my under eye area is so dry. No joke, by the end of a work day my under eye area (because it&#x27;s so dry) probably ages me 5 years. Being the broke college student I was (until a month ago), I was using the Walmart brand (equate) eye cream. It&#x27;s okay, certainly better than nothing, but I just needed something with a bit more moisture. After browsing online for a new eye cream I came across the Shikai Borage Therapy eye cream and decided to try it because of the positive reviews. Like I said, I&#x27;ve only used it a week, but if my under eye area continues to have positive results, I&#x27;ll certainly repurchase. Oh, and the Borage oil isn&#x27;t greasy at all. It absorbs quickly and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> It has all the right ingredients, and by a company I want to support. I&#x27;ve used other Shikai products and enjoyed them, but this eye cream just didn&#x27;t do it for me. I didn&#x27;t expect a miracle, but I did expect a cream I could spread around my eyes. This was too watery for me to spread with any degree of thickness, and did nothing for my under eye area. Bummer.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect consistency for my skin. I&#x27;ve found some eye creams to be too hard, but Shikai Borage smooths and sinks into my skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this product couple weeks ago and so far I am very satisfied with this cream.I love how this cream feels on my skin and it really moisturizes my under eye are.</li>
    <li> This eye lotion is mostly composed of water. I was not impressed. I like an eye lotion that actually moisturizes. I picked up another brand that was much more creamy and moisturizing: MyChelle-Cream-Fabulous-5-Ounce-Tube. It sounds like I work for that other company, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I first tried the skin lotion.  It was great and I could use it on my skin.  I have a great deal of reactions from topical lotions and creams.  I decided to try the eye cream since I could use the lotion.  It is great.  It smoothed my skin out very quickly. It is great for people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is really liquidy - I prefer my eye creams a bit thicker. I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase.  On the plus side it did not irritate the sensitive skin around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I choose this because I was looking for something more affordable compared to elta md&#x27;s eye gel but this product is more greasy. It doesn&#x27;t absorb completely into the skin and leaves a little greasy oily which I don&#x27;t like. I guess it&#x27;s better to use at night than in the morning before makeup. I probably won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> I like the way this cream goes on the skin. It feels very soothing from the get go. I have seen improvement with the overall texture of the skin over my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;It takes a while to absorb and sits on the skin shiny and hence it ends up in the eyes a bit and burns. I also don&#x27;t like that the oil separates from the cream.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be mislead this isn&#x27;t a miracle worker. But for me it&#x27;s my saving grace. When I turned 28, I suddenly became allergic to the majority of the products I was using on my face, which led to a long, uncomfortable process of weeding out the things that I couldn&#x27;t use. When I started using this, I was so pleased with the results. No reaction, and my eyes feel moisturized. I even use it on the fine lines on my forehead and it doesn&#x27;t break me out.&lt;br /&gt;Now it doesn&#x27;t use retinol, so that&#x27;s why I said don&#x27;t expect it to work miracles, but if you are like me and have extremely sensitive eyes, then this is definitely something you should try. The price alone is worth it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a big difference</li>
    <li> goes on easily and absorbs quickly.  Leaves skin feeling nice.  Good under makeup.  I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to evaluate how well it works on crows feet.</li>
    <li> I have now ordered this several times. I definitely notice a difference around my eyes. I&#x27;m 50 years old, and this has taken away any puffiness or dark circles. Would definitely recommend it.  Very light consistency (I don&#x27;t like thick lotion around my eyes).</li>
    <li> This product goes on smooth and absorbs quickly. I haven&#x27;t noticed any great improvements over any other under eye product I&#x27;ve used but it&#x27;s not any worse either.</li>
    <li> Umm honestly I have not noticed the fine lines decreasing (and I have been using this cream every day for 2 weeks now) but it DOES keep the under eye area hydrated. Don&#x27;t use it under makeup/concealer because it will grease up. In other words this is a good hydrating eye cream but that&#x27;s where it ends</li>
    <li> so far i like this a lot. i use it before bed at night and i think it does a great job.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful eye cream, one of many excellent products from Shikai. This feels like it just the skin just soaks it right up, in a good way -- it&#x27;s like a hydrating drink for the skin, and very soothing. No fragrance, either, which is a plus! It&#x27;s thinner than you might think, not really a &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; but rather more of a lotion consistency, just FYI. But that means it gets absorbed instead of just sitting on the surface. Definitely worth a try. I&#x27;ve been using only this for several years now.</li>
    <li> great eye moisturizer for sensitive skin. fragrance free. best use in night time since it&#x27;s a little oily under makeup.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about this eye cream upon purchasing but after using it consecutively for about 2 weeks, I did notice a difference. My under eyes are smooth, hydrated and my fine lines seem to have blurred out a bit. I gave this product a 4 star because I wasn&#x27;t able to apply this to my eyelids like I would with other eye creams. It seems to sting and burn my eyes whenever I apply it there and makes it unbearable.</li>
    <li> The cream I expected to be a little thicker, so it tends to leak out of the bottle or comes out too quickly.</li>
    <li> Much better than the pricier eye cream I was using before and much less expensive!  Works day and night and is NOT greasy!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Love the ingredients list and this product works great. I find it hard to find natural products that work as great as this one</li>
    <li> this has cleared a problem which I have had for a very long time. it eased the problem from the momnt it was applied</li>
    <li> this is probably the least expensive eye cream i&#x27;ve ever purchased and i&#x27;d have to say that it works just as well as the others. will probably repurchase when it&#x27;s time.</li>
    <li> Not greasy, good moisturizer for the eye before applying makeup.  Lasts forever.</li>
    <li> The eye cream is a little more runny than i expected</li>
    <li> I like this cream.  It is soothing and keeps the skin under my eyes smooth.  It seeps in and is not greasy.</li>
    <li> I read about this product line online. The article compared VERY EXPENSIVE, high-end products to moderately-priced products that were just as effective. The article compared Borage products to La Mer maoisturizing products.Well, I&#x27;ve never been able to pay $250.00 for an ounce of moisturizer, but THIS product line is really wonderful. It moisturizes all day long without causing breakouts and it gives you great results. VERY HAPPY!!!!!</li>
    <li> This Dry Skin Therapy for  the Eyes is so smooth and rich.  You need only a dot to go a long long way.  I&#x27;m glad that I found it and it&#x27;s better than any other eye cream I&#x27;ve used.  The pricing is reasonable and the product superb.  Will continue to purchase as needed.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream so much.. I always used and still do the Neutrogena healthy skin eye cream and that works great but I have to use it sparingly or I do get a little red but it has kept my eyes line free but with Shikai eye cream it keeps my eyes so soft and wrinkle free with no side effects or redness ever.. I am using this and my neutrogena and doing a test on each eye cause I can&#x27;t decide which one does more.. I do want to just stay with this cause it has no irritants but my neutrogena keeps my eyes really toned and love wearing under concealers.. I might just have to use 2 forever.. I will never be without this one even if I do find another one because it&#x27;s the ONLY one and I&#x27;ve used about 50 different eye creams that has no redness and I see my lines softening over night...Can&#x27;t believe I use to use a $75 dollar eye cream that didn&#x27;t do half as good as this $13 dollar one.. It&#x27;s not always true if you spend more you get better quality.. Not with this!</li>
    <li> As with all of Shikai&#x27;s products, this is a wonderful, ick-free option for dry skin.  It is hard to find unscented eye creams that are targeted for dry skin and don&#x27;t leave skin greasy or oily.  This is perfect!  A little goes a long way and it blends in smoothly and completely.  This eye cream is not thick, but it keeps the skin near my eyes moisturized all day.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Just like every other eye cream I use. It doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes or anything and keeps them moisturized for most of the day. Eyes still flake though when I use my concealer.</li>
    <li> I was expecting this stuff to be horrible. Honestly, I was. I&#x27;ve tried nearly every eye cream out there and they all either make my eyes burn or don&#x27;t do anything to moisturize better than an average body lotion. But I do really love the fact that this cream is great for sensitive eyes and moisturizes at the same time (goes great under makeup, too).</li>
    <li> My review on old cream (green). Really best under-eye cream I&#x27;ve used so far. Does not make you look 20 Years younger, but great moisturizing properties \\&quot;plump\\&quot; my under eye area up. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Update. They changed it to blue, the formula also seem runnier. I don&#x27;t like it anymore.</li>
    <li> I use this eye cream on my eyelids to smoothen out the old age wrinkles.  It works, I bought two more for future use.</li>
    <li> My skin has become dry around my eyes...this is an amazing product that hydrates and reduces the lines.  I used Clinique&#x27;s all about eyes Rich prior and this product took it&#x27;s place. VERY pleased.</li>
    <li> very moisturising cream and its easily absorbed too. the best part - doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, which was the case with all the eye creams i had tried till now. with other creams, my eyes start burning and itching. the only thing is, i wish these guys had put some anti-aging properties too in it..</li>
    <li> Very emollient. When I first bought this (by recommendation from my facial lady), I was hesitant b/c it seemed very watery. Upon use, I have found it very emollient and that it works well for my dry, dry eye area. It&#x27;s also GREAT for sensitive eyes! The cost on Amazon was significantly less than the shelf price at my local health foods store. I buy in advance so I don&#x27;t run out now, and even gave my mom some for Christmas. If you are looking for super-duper age-defying magical product, this isn&#x27;t for you. It&#x27;s a gentle formula which focuses on hydration.</li>
    <li> If you need a cheap eye cream, this one does a decent job of providing moisture. I experienced no breakouts or irritation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a little over a month now, I haven&#x27;t really noticed diminished wrinkles---yet--- but I have seen improved hydration, which is the main reason I bought it. I am going to buy other products from this brand, and see how they work.</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing. They stopped selling this at Whole Foods and Sprouts, so I was glad to be able to find it here. The company that makes my eye makeup remover changed the formula and all of a sudden my under eye area became extremely dried out and flaky. I&#x27;ve never had that problem before. I tried so many eye creams and this one provided the perfect solution. It worked wonders on the dry patches under my eyes and I have continued to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t change dark circles or anything that I have found, but it is amazing for hydrating the under eye area!</li>
    <li> The first time I used it, my eyes burned (perhaps the borage capsules I use for my face got into my eye). I tried it again a few days later and much better. I don&#x27;t see any difference between using this cream compared to expensive eye creams. Would recommend folks give it a try.</li>
    <li> This is an okay product, but was not as thick and emollient as I expected. It has a slightly watery consistency and is probably best suited to daytime wear. If you have very dry skin, I think something a bit more thick and creamy would be more appropriate. My eyes are very sensitive and it caused no irritation, which is good. It is also very light so it won&#x27;t cause breakouts for those with more oily skin types.</li>
    <li> Does help with my 50+yr old face...dimishes crow&#x27;s feet and does not add a lot of shine. Not oily and does not irritate my sensitive skin. Good value.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> It does help my dry skin around my eye area. I looked refreshed and it only takes a very small amount of eye cream to dab it around your eye area.</li>
    <li> I ordered the moisturizer, but got the eye cream first!  Like they used to say in the 1940&#x27;s Hubba hubba zing zing, this eye cream has everything!!  It firms the skin around the eyes, and hydrates quite nicely!  I love the fact that you only need a little bit, and pat dot it around the eyes!</li>
    <li> I use this eye cream under my eyes to smooth out the dry spots . It works really well! , I will purchase this item again .</li>
    <li> very runny consistency, easy to spill. Doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
    <li> I have pretty serious puffy eyes when my allergies are bad, and unfortunately this doesn&#x27;t do much for them. Having used it regularly for about 2 months now, I&#x27;ll say that it has improved the &amp;#34;softness and suppleness&amp;#34; of my eyes, haven&#x27;t noticed a different in fine lines or puffiness. Oh well. It also stings if it gets even close to getting in my eyes, and the scent leaves something to be desired.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all...cheap to expensive. This product is light, fragrance-free and instantly improves the tight dry lines around my eyes. It&#x27;s really, really good. Now, I don&#x27;t use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the small containers, too. Easy for traveling.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. I have some small lines and dark circles. This product definitely helps. I saw the results after just a week,but I think that that depends on the age and conditions. It&#x27;s not doing miracles, but it&#x27;s doing it for me :)</li>
    <li> I had never heard of this brand before, and I happened to run across it when I did a search on amazon for eye creams. I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream for a few months now. I really like how light the cream is, yet it moisturizes the skin around the eye area pretty well. You don&#x27;t need much. Less than a pea size amount of the eye cream is enough for both eyes, so this small tube has lasted me a while. I did not look for an eye cream for dark circles, firming, etc. All I wanted was something that would moisturize the skin around my eyes, which tends to be dry even in the warmer months. This eye cream did exactly what I was hoping it to do, so I will continue to purchase and use it. If you&#x27;re looking for a moisturizing eye cream, I would recommend this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several eye creams in the past and this one is definitely one of my favorites. I use it 20 mins after applying a retinol cream since they tend to be drying and this is perfect. It moisturizes really well. The tube usually lasts me about 4-5 months of everyday use- that&#x27;s excellent considering the price. It can make the eye area look a little shiny so don&#x27;t go crazy applying it! A little goes a long way here. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Highly moisturizing lovely eye cream, but has really done nothing to actually improve the skin around my eyes. Never irritating and a good cream, but just no miracle. I would buy again tho bc it is still more than decent.</li>
    <li> You cannot go wrong with Shikai products. I loved everything I bought from this line. I am basically addicted. Highly recommend. Great smell, no irritation, no side effects. perfect skin care.</li>
    <li> I ordered this eye cream for night use.  I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and have noticed that my eye area has started to dry out.  The price of the cream is good for the amount of cream that you get, but it&#x27;s very runny.  If I store the bottle on the lid as it is in the picture, when I remove the cap, the cream comes rushing out all over the place.  The cream does help to hydrate, but it&#x27;s not hydrating enough for me.  I won&#x27;t be reordering.</li>
    <li> I have tried several eye creams specifically for moisturizing the delicate skin around my eyes.  I saw this and bought it based on the great reviews.  Well, the reviews are accurate because this is the best eye cream ever....I&#x27;m 64 and this cream has made a very noticeable difference in reducing dryness and the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
    <li> Not great - product became soupy after a month or so. Eye cream needs some heft to it -- wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> This cream works great for moisturizing my eyes, especially on the upper lid and the middle of my undereye area. At first, I used it around my entire eye esp to prevent crows&#x27; feet, but then I&#x27;d wake up in the morning with irritation and crust from it.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was this cream or something else, so I stopped using this cream for several days (eyes cleared and were fine) and then started using this cream again - and the irritation and crust came back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and sensitive eyes.  Although this a moisturizing powerhouse, I simply can&#x27;t use it since I react to it, and I caution others with sensitivities to find an eye cream that is for sensitive skin, hypoallergenic and opthalmologist tested. I have used a lot of eye creams - Oil of Olay, Burts Bees, Neutrogena, Avalon Organics, and now Simple - and I never reacted except for this one time.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed after they changed the formula. This used to be my favorite must have eye cream in white green tube. But it doesn&#x27;t work as great after the formula changed (blue tube).</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Healed a terrible falre-up of eczema around my eyes! Truly amazing results, plus it&#x27;s a great moisturizer. Light and effective, wears well under make-up. Love it!</li>
    <li> Came across this via Paula&#x27;s Choise and very happy with this eye cream. Works a lot better than the $80+ creams I&#x27;ve used over the years. I live in a very dry climate, have have very dry skin and I&#x27;m 39 years old.</li>
    <li> I am so picky about my eye moisturizer, but really liked this one.  An added benefit is that they don&#x27;t test on animals!</li>
    <li> The product came promptly. I thought it would be creamier but I only tried it a few times and may have better results over time.</li>
