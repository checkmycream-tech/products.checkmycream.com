      <li>Smells great.</li>
      <li>My baby fine hair has been my greatest challenge forever.  </li>
      <li>Smells good but does not keep a sea salt hold.</li>
      <li>Gives my hair good body and fullness and a good texture.</li>
      <li>As a curly hair gal, most know you must use more than one product to have perfect curls.</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>The type of salt used does not un-do the popular smoothing treatments that require you to avoid sodium chloride and sulfates, this is safe!</li>
      <li>Product is ok... doesn&#x27;t have a great smell but works ok.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair</li>
      <li>It smells wonderful, but when I spray it in my hair when it&#x27;s dry, it seems to make it kind of sticky, and it looks greasy.  </li>
      <li>and I thought that the vegan ingredients would be okay for my scalp.</li>
      <li>Love the smell n</li>
      <li>but I love lots of it and my hair is layered.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Best product in the entire VERB line.</li>
      <li>I like the way the spray is a fine mist out of the bottle.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine</li>
      <li>Edit: While I liked the texture I got when my hair was longer, this doesn&#x27;t really do anything for shorter hair.</li>
      <li>Great lightweight texturizer for short hair.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this product, it&#x27;s not over whelming and keeps your hair smelling fresh for hours after you use it.</li>
      <li>It honestly didn&#x27;t really do much for my hair.</li>
      <li>I like to spray it on throughout the day to smooth away any frizz that pops up.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s best to not use much and it gives just enough texture to manage.</li>
      <li>On the pros side for this particular product the smell is nice, it&#x27;s androgynous and clean,</li>
      <li>However since adding sea salt spray to my regimen, I now use very minimal to no gel for my hair and have beautiful curls.</li>
      <li>Generous size and the price is right!</li>
      <li>I am a hairstylist and have had great results on a wide variety of textures using this spray.</li>
      <li>but honestly it made my scalp so itchy just because it completely dries you out.</li>
      <li>the closest to the true beachy hair results when your out in the sea.</li>
      <li>makes your hair look super dope</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and this really works wonders for texture.</li>
      <li>This really helps to define the layers, and gives my fine hair volume.</li>
      <li>In fact, when I tried to run a brush thru my hair later, it was kind of tangly.</li>
      <li>The VERB brand is a cool green color with a nice light scent.</li>
      <li>I find that this spray works best after my hair has mostly dried; I have a short pixie crop.</li>
      <li>It makes your hair crunchy but is great when I want to make my short hair curly instead of flat from sweat, water, heat or humidity.</li>
      <li>This is the first sea spray I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve since moved onto another brand that gives much better short hair texture and style (Kevin Murphy), and I&#x27;m much happier with that.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curl easily, and this doesn&#x27;t weight it down.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted to be able to use it to freshen up my hair while dry.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the smell of this sea salt spray - smells fresh, not sweet or flowery.</li>
      <li>It really works to give my hair volume and texture.</li>
      <li>I tried it when my hair was damp, and it seems to lessen that, but doesn&#x27;t really do much for my curl.  </li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>The smell took me a while to get used to, but I really like it now.</li>
      <li>This smells divine - fresh - and gives my hair enough of a good &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; texture to keep it edgy and interesting, not soft and &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>I will edit when I&#x27;ve used a little longer, but so far, I&#x27;m not super impressed.  </li>
      <li>I am zero fuss/maintenance prone and I can spritz this product on my hair, blow dry, scrunch, and have messy, awesome hair the entire day.  </li>
      <li>I still use this even with the issues because it makes my hair super shiny and my waves and curls look fantastic, but once it&#x27;s dried</li>
      <li>Not worth paying more for this product than cheaper ones.</li>
      <li>The pump is little stiff so it doesn&#x27;t have an easy flow, maybe after a couple of uses it will it get better.</li>
      <li>My stylist used this on my hair recently and the first thing I noticed is the fragrance...</li>
      <li>Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t make my hair heavy or crusty/crunchy.  </li>
      <li>Smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair hard or dry.</li>
      <li>; Maybe I used too much, or not enough.</li>
      <li>Creates more body and thickness that fine, limp hair lacks for everyday blow dry style, and texture needed for up dos and twist and pin styles.</li>
      <li>I tried using it more than once, when my hair was wet, when it was damp and once when it was dry to see if I would get different results.</li>
      <li>but then I use some Pual Mitchell Super Skinny for a little shine.</li>
      <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because there is a slight crispness to my hair if I use very much of the product.</li>
      <li>Only thing is the cheaper sea salt spray from my local Meijer works as well this and cost half as much.</li>
      <li>Great investment v. other less expensive &amp;#34;beach&amp;#34; sprays.</li>

<li> And very small!</li>
<li> bad hair day.&amp;#34</li>
<li> My hair looked and felt disgusting each time.</li>

    <li> This gives my curls lots of bounce. I like to spray it on throughout the day to smooth away any frizz that pops up.</li>
    <li> Gives my hair good body and fullness and a good texture. Also holds up well all day, even if it gets wet/sweaty, and doesn&#x27;t come off on my hands after it&#x27;s dry.  Edit: While I liked the texture I got when my hair was longer, this doesn&#x27;t really do anything for shorter hair.

I&#x27;ve since moved onto another brand that gives much better short hair texture and style (Kevin Murphy), and I&#x27;m much happier with that.</li>
    <li> It honestly didn&#x27;t really do much for my hair. It just felt like I was putting water in it. Other sea sprays that I&#x27;ve tried have given my hair subtle, soft hold -- this did nothing.</li>
    <li> Gives my hair lots of curls,</li>
    <li> Not really sure what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Spritzing my hair with water works just as well and doesn&#x27;t leave it crusty like this stuff. In fact, when I tried to run a brush thru my hair later, it was kind of tangly. I&#x27;ll try it again, because I&#x27;ve only used it once any maybe I was having &amp;#34;a bad hair day.&amp;#34; Maybe I used too much, or not enough. I doubt I&#x27;m going to I feel any differently about it though.</li>
    <li> makes your hair look super dope</li>
    <li> Not worth paying more for this product than cheaper ones. It did nothing to my hair that always has responded well to sea salt sprays! And very small!</li>
    <li> This is the first sea spray I&#x27;ve ever used. I bought it because I have skin sensitivities and I thought that the vegan ingredients would be okay for my scalp. If i had read the ingredients in one of the answered questions I wouldn&#x27;t have bought because it lists that this has fragrance, which can also give me migraines depending on the scent. The smell took me a while to get used to, but I really like it now. I find that this spray works best after my hair has mostly dried; I have a short pixie crop.</li>
    <li> My stylist used this on my hair recently and the first thing I noticed is the fragrance...it smells great! My hair is fine but I love lots of it and my hair is layered. This really helps to define the layers, and gives my fine hair volume. Unlike mousse for volume, this doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky. It does dull the hair just a bit but then I use some Pual Mitchell Super Skinny for a little shine.</li>
    <li> On the pros side for this particular product the smell is nice, it&#x27;s androgynous and clean, nothing too fruity. It does a great job of adding texture and definition to hair. The issue for me is that on average I only wash my hair every three days or so and this product should be washed out every day. Trying to brush your hair out after the spray has dried is near impossible, it&#x27;s formed a salt crust and pulling a brush through that it a battle. I still use this even with the issues because it makes my hair super shiny and my waves and curls look fantastic, but once it&#x27;s dried there&#x27;s no more messing with it, unless you want to turn into a crusty sea-witch.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the smell of this sea salt spray - smells fresh, not sweet or flowery.</li>
    <li> Ive tried all kinds of sea spray products and for me this one gets my hair the closest to the true beachy hair results when your out in the sea. I am a hairstylist and have had great results on a wide variety of textures using this spray. I even use it on finer texture hair that is wet, spray it all over and blow it out with a round brush. (Directions do not say to use it this way, but like I said I get great results) Its described as a dry texturizer.  Creates more body and thickness that fine, limp hair lacks for everyday blow dry style, and texture needed for up dos and twist and pin styles. Generous size and the price is right! The type of salt used does not un-do the popular smoothing treatments that require you to avoid sodium chloride and sulfates, this is safe! Best product in the entire VERB line.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on a Sea Spray kick for my hair, so I&#x27;m trying lots of different brands. The VERB brand is a cool green color with a nice light scent. I like the way the spray is a fine mist out of the bottle. It really works to give my hair volume and texture. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because there is a slight crispness to my hair if I use very much of the product.</li>
    <li> Great lightweight texturizer for short hair.</li>
    <li> My baby fine hair has been my greatest challenge forever.  Whenever I went to the beach, I did notice how the texture changed especially in the Caribbean so I decided to try this out.  It works!  I was amazed.  It&#x27;s best to not use much and it gives just enough texture to manage.</li>
    <li> Smells good but does not keep a sea salt hold.</li>
    <li> Works very well. As a curly hair gal, most know you must use more than one product to have perfect curls. However since adding sea salt spray to my regimen, I now use very minimal to no gel for my hair and have beautiful curls. Only thing is the cheaper sea salt spray from my local Meijer works as well this and cost half as much.</li>
    <li> I just transitioned from long hair to short and am learning the world of hair products.  This is a definite keeper.  I use it in tandem with a thickening spray (Thermafuse Boost) and B&amp;B Brilliantine to make the ends &amp;#34;piecey&amp;#34;.  This smells divine - fresh - and gives my hair enough of a good &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; texture to keep it edgy and interesting, not soft and &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34;.  I have fine hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curl easily, and this doesn&#x27;t weight it down.  I am zero fuss/maintenance prone and I can spritz this product on my hair, blow dry, scrunch, and have messy, awesome hair the entire day.  Great investment v. other less expensive &amp;#34;beach&amp;#34; sprays.</li>
    <li> This stuff works well but honestly it made my scalp so itchy just because it completely dries you out. I would suggest not spraying this anywhere close to your scalp.</li>
    <li> I like the smell but it does leave  hair  feeling a little greasy.</li>
    <li> Product is ok... doesn&#x27;t have a great smell but works ok.</li>
    <li> Love the smell n rocks the curls n wave</li>
    <li> Smells great. It makes your hair crunchy but is great when I want to make my short hair curly instead of flat from sweat, water, heat or humidity.</li>
    <li> Loooove this product!! Smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair hard or dry.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product, it&#x27;s not over whelming and keeps your hair smelling fresh for hours after you use it. The pump is little stiff so it doesn&#x27;t have an easy flow, maybe after a couple of uses it will it get better.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t make my hair heavy or crusty/crunchy.  I have very fine hair so finding a new product is difficult.  I will be using this a lot more!!!</li>
    <li> This did nothing to style my hair and left it very dry and gross feeling. I tried using it more than once, when my hair was wet, when it was damp and once when it was dry to see if I would get different results. My hair looked and felt disgusting each time.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this really works wonders for texture.</li>
    <li> Love it. Gives my hair fullness.</li>
    <li> I will edit when I&#x27;ve used a little longer, but so far, I&#x27;m not super impressed.  It smells wonderful, but when I spray it in my hair when it&#x27;s dry, it seems to make it kind of sticky, and it looks greasy.  I tried it when my hair was damp, and it seems to lessen that, but doesn&#x27;t really do much for my curl.  I really wanted to be able to use it to freshen up my hair while dry.</li>
