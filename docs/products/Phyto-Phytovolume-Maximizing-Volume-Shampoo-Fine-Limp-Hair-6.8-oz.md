      <li>I liked the fragrance, but I see others did not.</li>

      <li>I have baby fine type hair but a good amount of it.</li>

<li> I was desperate for volume as I was loosing my hair and this is amazing stuff.</li>
<li> This shampoo worked very well to make it appear thicker, and also left it shiny and soft, unlike some other volumizing shampoos which left it thicker because they dried it out and left it flyaway and took away the curl.</li>
<li> This shampoo has a light, plant like fragrance while using it wet, slightly vanilla or medicinal, but this fragrance went away when it dried.</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
<li> After the third shampoo my hair is lackluster and dry.  </li>
<li> With fine, thin hair, I need a product that will volumize without coating my hair with anything that will weight it down.  </li>
<li> I can use this for a time or two before I have to use a conditioner because it does dry out my hair.  </li>
<li> When I started using this shampoo, my hair was very dry and brittle.  </li>
<li> Also, when the bottle was delivered there was no safety seal, and the box was crushed.  </li>
<li> It might be slightly thinner than other shampoos but not much.</li>
<li> I have very thin straight shoulder length hair, and I saw absolutely no difference!</li>
<li> Dark brown and all I could do was mix it in my hand with another shampoo I had.  </li>
<li> I miss wearing my hair down, so I went on a shampoo shopping spree!  </li>
<li> At any rate, I really do not care how thick it is on my hand; I care how my hair looks after washing it.  </li>
<li> BUT only if you use it with the Volume conditioner Cream...if you don&#x27;t your hair will feel like Barbie Doll hair...and that is not a good thing!</li>
<li> You do need a conditioner after though as it leaves your hair a bit stiff and hard to brush through.</li>
<li> I disagree with other writers that this shampoo is thin as water.</li>
<li> Not good for dark dyed hair, it will strip your color!</li>
<li> But in any case it is very faint and goes away completely on drying.</li>
<li> and a little does NOT go a long way making this a very expensive shampoo.  </li>
<li> After a week, no one would ever know my hair had been in such bad shape.</li>
<li> Dull, lack of shine, gone!  </li>
<li> thin as water and smells like dish lotion.  </li>
<li> so disappointing.</li>
<li> What a disappointment.</li>

    <li> This product works wonders with my fine hair, giving me much more volume, and it is still gentle, not drying.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  The only voluminizing shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried -- and I&#x27;ve tried them all -- that really works.  It also cleans my oily hair better and leaves it shining.  I can go three days between shampoos and my hair still looks great.</li>
    <li> I can use this for a time or two before I have to use a conditioner because it does dry out my hair.  Still I like it.</li>
    <li> Light enough for my baby fine hair without weighing it down. Don&#x27;t expect lots of bubbles, but your hair will be squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> The first shampoo was great.  My hair was manageable for the first time ever.  Didn&#x27;t last long.  After the third shampoo my hair is lackluster and dry.

    <li> I was shocked to find the shampoo running out of the bottle, not smelling very good or having the consistency of every other good shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.  Dark brown and all I could do was mix it in my hand with another shampoo I had.  I have no idea if it helps or not!!</li>
    <li> The best volumizing shampoo I have tried yet.  My hair is consistent from scalp to ends and it&#x27;s not weighed down or oily.  It&#x27;s like the perfect ingredience for my fine limp hair.</li>
    <li> Best voluminzing shampoo out there albeit the pricey-est. If you want volume and willing to pay for it  - this is your product. Warning it is brown in color but it works. I was desperate for volume as I was loosing my hair and this is amazing stuff. You do need a conditioner after though as it leaves your hair a bit stiff and hard to brush through.</li>
    <li> thin as water and smells like dish lotion.  saw no improvement. no better than any other shampoo for fine hair. and a little does NOT go a long way making this a very expensive shampoo.  i have shoulder length hair and had to use a lot to get a lather. so disappointing.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo.  After a lifetime of thin,flat hair, I finally have some volume.  I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a couple of years and remain a complete fan</li>
    <li> Just a heads up the product is very watery, the viscosity of the shampoo is unlike normal shampoo. Not good for dark dyed hair, it will strip your color! I have very thin straight shoulder length hair, and I saw absolutely no difference!</li>
    <li> When I started using this shampoo, my hair was very dry and brittle.  After only one use, I could feel and see an improvement.  After a week, no one would ever know my hair had been in such bad shape.</li>

Lately, my hair has been looking like a damp dish rag, full of static and just unmanageable. It has gotten to the point that I just pull my hair up all the time out of frustration. I miss wearing my hair down, so I went on a shampoo shopping spree!  Static, gone! Limpness, gone! Dull, lack of shine, gone!  As to the smell, it has a nice fresh smell. It doesn&#x27;t smell as good or strong as some others have tried but with the results that this gives, this is a non-issue. The smell is fine.  I will definitely be ordering this product again. It is worth every penny.</li>
