      <li>Very clean feeling and great scent.</li>
      <li>Love the scent, largest bottle of shampoo ever!</li>
      <li>Great stuff, smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know much about hair care products but in my opinion this has to be the best men shampoo&#x27;s</li>
      <li>Works well with a nice scent.</li>
      <li>leaves my scalp feeling good and my hair easy to manage.  </li>
      <li>Love it, Love it, Love it!</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair silky smooth - great lather nice refreshing clean hair.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is mild but pleasant.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell of this shampoo but for some reason it makes my head itch.</li>
      <li>I love the smell</li>
      <li>I have been using this shampoo for many years and have tried so many over the years and nothing worked well....</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>Love the smell of this 2 in 1 shampoo/conditioner.</li>
      <li>My barber recommended this to me and I love it.</li>
      <li>Great product - highly recommend!  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is appealing but not over-powering.  </li>
      <li>I am going to buy more of these, no question.</li>
      <li>Great shampoo, makes my scalp feel clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>My hair is silky smooth and radiates sexy vibes at around 9*10^15</li>
      <li>so I was excited when I saw they had a new 2-in-1, and I was very pleased when we received it.</li>
      <li>The good news is that you only smell it while using it, it doesn&#x27;t linger in your hair after the shower.</li>
      <li>The better shampoos don&#x27;t foam much at all.</li>
      <li>The items were what they were described as and came quickly</li>
      <li>My new favorite.</li>
      <li>I switched back to Redkin&#x27;s &amp;#34;Go Clean Daily&amp;#34; which is ideal for my daily shampoos; if I skip a day my hair doesn&#x27;t clump up.</li>
      <li>I have found that shampoo that gets really soapy is just full of chemicals to trick you into thinking your hair is clean.</li>
      <li>Smells amazing, lathers nicely and doesn&#x27;t seem to give me dry itchy scalp issues like a lot of other shampoos.  </li>
      <li>Anyways, I am glad I got this big bottle because you cannot find it at most local hair salons.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good quality 2-in-1 for a long time, and it seems like they are all cheap brands that dry out my husband&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>Minimal quantity does an amazing job of foaming up and cleaning the hair without leaving it feeling completely oil-stripped.</li>
      <li>and this product really delivers for the price.</li>
      <li>This is not sulfate-free and really dries your hair out.</li>
      <li>My hair smells and handles very well after cleaning.  </li>
      <li>Just so you know, clean spice was actually the 6 spice girl.  </li>
      <li>I love Redkin products, but the conditioner in &amp;#34;Clean Spice&amp;#34; left my hair a bit clumpy a day later.  </li>
      <li>my hair was a lot better, not perfect but better.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and came a day early!  </li>
      <li>The shampoo seems to be of high quality and is a bargain.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend to anyone with normal hair...</li>
      <li>I am used to the old Redken smell.........</li>
      <li>I was introduced to this product by a hair professional and it works for me.  </li>
      <li>In reality they are just stripping all the oils away from your hair, which is not the body&#x27;s natural tendency.</li>
      <li>We tried quite a few products before finding Clean Spice 2.</li>
      <li>I would go to my local hair salon and buy a new shampoo every time I got a haircut because someone would suggest it and nothing worked for my hair.  </li>
      <li>The issue is the scent, which I&#x27;ve variously described as &amp;#34;cinnamon goat sweat,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;spicy muskox,&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;homeless hippie.&amp;#34;  I think they were shooting for earthy and masculine, and I guess you could say they succeeded.  </li>
      <li>They only sell the small bottle at my store and the price difference is only a few dollars and the big bottle gets 3 times as many Ounces.  </li>
      <li>a little too much conditioner for me.</li>

<li> Maybe 2 and a half...</li>
<li> All the shampoos were making my hair oily and looked bad after washing until this product.  </li>

    <li> Works great for all hair types and keeps scalp healthy without shampoo buildup</li>
    <li> Love it, Love it, Love it! I&#x27;ve been looking for a good quality 2-in-1 for a long time, and it seems like they are all cheap brands that dry out my husband&#x27;s hair. I trust Redken so I was excited when I saw they had a new 2-in-1, and I was very pleased when we received it. My husband loves the woodsy scent and it made his hair so soft-not to mention he smelled great! I am going to buy more of these, no question. Great product for the man that takes 5 minute showers! :-)</li>
    <li> This is not sulfate-free and really dries your hair out. I have switched to M by Paul Mitchell. I have found that shampoo that gets really soapy is just full of chemicals to trick you into thinking your hair is clean. In reality they are just stripping all the oils away from your hair, which is not the body&#x27;s natural tendency. The better shampoos don&#x27;t foam much at all.</li>
    <li> My barber recommended this to me and I love it. Great shampoo, makes my scalp feel clean and fresh. Works well if you have greasy hair.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, smells fantastic.</li>
    <li> Smells good. Last long. Hubby likes it.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, lathers nicely and doesn&#x27;t seem to give me dry itchy scalp issues like a lot of other shampoos.  Did I mention how great it smells?  I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a great spce scent that is manly.  Ha!  The shampoo lathers up well and cleans hair well.  My new favorite.</li>
    <li> Maybe 2 and a half...I am used to the old Redken smell.........a little too much conditioner for me. Thats all</li>
    <li> I love Redkin products, but the conditioner in &amp;#34;Clean Spice&amp;#34; left my hair a bit clumpy a day later.  I switched back to Redkin&#x27;s &amp;#34;Go Clean Daily&amp;#34; which is ideal for my daily shampoos; if I skip a day my hair doesn&#x27;t clump up.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product by a hair professional and it works for me.  I am an aging male with snow white hair and this shampoo leaves my scalp feeling good and my hair easy to manage.  The fragrance is mild but pleasant.  I would recommend to anyone with normal hair...</li>
    <li> Good product. I love the smell</li>
    <li> Not as good as the mint shampoo. In fact I would rate this a glorified Pert.</li>
    <li> The shampoo seems to be of high quality and is a bargain.  The issue is the scent, which I&#x27;ve variously described as &amp;#34;cinnamon goat sweat,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;spicy muskox,&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;homeless hippie.&amp;#34;  I think they were shooting for earthy and masculine, and I guess you could say they succeeded.  The good news is that you only smell it while using it, it doesn&#x27;t linger in your hair after the shower.</li>
    <li> The items were what they were described as and came quickly</li>
    <li> Love the scent, largest bottle of shampoo ever! We pour it into smaller bottles for the shower. Great price for the amount.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great for color-treated hair. I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> Always the best products!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my fiance after it was discontinued in my salon and 5 different salons nearby. Smells good, very pleased. He has no complaints.</li>
    <li> yes. My hair is silky smooth and radiates sexy vibes at around 9*10^15 Hz ever since I started using this 2 in 1 shampoo.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo!  Our son needed something that would help him control oily hair without over drying his scalp.  We tried quite a few products before finding Clean Spice 2.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for many years and have tried so many over the years and nothing worked well....until this one.  I would go to my local hair salon and buy a new shampoo every time I got a haircut because someone would suggest it and nothing worked for my hair.  All the shampoos were making my hair oily and looked bad after washing until this product.  I bought a smaller bottle and the next time I came to the salon my hair was a lot better, not perfect but better.  Anyways, I am glad I got this big bottle because you cannot find it at most local hair salons.  They only sell the small bottle at my store and the price difference is only a few dollars and the big bottle gets 3 times as many Ounces.  I am so happy to find this on amazon.</li>
    <li> Great product - highly recommend!  Redken is a great brand and make a quality product. Shipping was fast and came a day early!  Love the smell of this 2 in 1 shampoo/conditioner. Leaves my hair silky smooth - great lather nice refreshing clean hair.</li>
    <li> Very clean feeling and great scent. I would prefer buying it at the store, but I&#x27;m unclear on whether or not Redken still makes this or if it was discontinued.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this shampoo but for some reason it makes my head itch. But it is a great spicey smelling shampoo</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. Minimal quantity does an amazing job of foaming up and cleaning the hair without leaving it feeling completely oil-stripped. The fragnance is subtle but pleasing, and the &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; it leaves on the hair is smooth and soft, and makes my ridiculously thick and coarse hail a breeze to comb and manage. It&#x27;s a winner.</li>
    <li> Just so you know, clean spice was actually the 6 spice girl.  I&#x27;m a guy, but its 2014 and thats ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good 2 in 1, I&#x27;ve got thickish, but not oily hair.  no complaints.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know much about hair care products but in my opinion this has to be the best men shampoo&#x27;s I have ever used.  The fragrance is appealing but not over-powering.  My hair smells and handles very well after cleaning.  You get what you pay for is what I always say and this product really delivers for the price.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product that has a wonderful smell as you use it on your hair. This smell lingers for a bit and is very nice.</li>
    <li> Works well with a nice scent.</li>
    <li> Best product for men and teenagers!</li>
