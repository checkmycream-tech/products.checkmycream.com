<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Absolutely fantastic, only need to wear for an hour really if u don&#x27;t want to wear it while u sleep, it can slide off or move a little sometimes if ur hot in bed, it&#x27;s the best thing ever!! I was desperate for something to erase my lined chest every morning wen I woke up!!!</li>
    <li> It is OK if you need a temporary solution before you are going out to an event. Too pricy for the time it lasted. I used four nights, followed instructions and it started to peel.</li>
    <li> This product really works.  For me, it doesn&#x27;t stay sticky as long as I&#x27;d like, i get maybe three weeks out of it if I use it every night.  It&#x27;s fairly comfortable.  Sometimes my chest is a little red in the mornings, washing thoroughly helps some, it fades after a while, nothing majorly noticeable to others I don&#x27;t think.  But, I think it&#x27;s worth it, because you can actually see a difference, even after just a night or two.  I&#x27;m a skeptic for cosmetic-type things that claim you can see a difference right away, but this is an exception!</li>
    <li> These silicone décolleté ads are amazing! Wear every night in bed and banish those ugly wrinkles! I put mine on immediately before bed and the results speak for themselves!amazing product!</li>
    <li> Works well! I clean mine with baby shampoo. I dont stick the pad to the clear sheet provided, it loses its adhesiveness. Instead I place mine face up in a sealed container every night to keep out dust particles. One pad usually lasts me about 3 weeks so I wish it was a little less expensive.</li>
    <li> This is the second pad I&#x27;ve purchased and I&#x27;m saving it for a special occasion.  It&#x27;s too expensive to use every day but it does what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> The pad itself works well but..........&lt;br /&gt;For the price, there should be more than one, at least two.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the glue that holds the pad in place lasts for only a few weeks. Too bad because I would buy allot more, (even at that price), if it lasted longer!!!</li>
    <li> This is our second purchase of these, so I can say she absolutely loves them.  The shipping was fast and item exactly as described.</li>
    <li> The pad lasted me only around two weeks but the results were very good. However, the adhesive is not strong enough to hold the pad in place when lying on my side, which is the whole point of the product. Once one edge lifted, lint and/or cat hair got embedded in the silicone and no amount of cleaning would remove it. So, over the two weeks, less and less of the surface would adhere. For the money, I think something like the Intimia pillow is a better buy. I plan to try it next. But I would definitely buy this, or another silicone gel product, for special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll also mention that it&#x27;s challenging to get it in just the right spot. Too high and you&#x27;ll get creases from the top edge of the pad. Too low and it won&#x27;t prevent the higher up wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these pads for about a year now. I buy a new one roughly every 6-8 weeks. When I sleep on my side (when I&#x27;m overtired I do this), I have to buy them more often than when I sleep on my back. They simply get more wear and tear when I&#x27;m on my side.&lt;br /&gt;This product does not make the creases on your d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; disappear completely, but it does make them look much less noticeable and helps prevent new ones. I wish I&#x27;d started wearing them earlier.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and it took a few months of wearing them for the effect to last longer than a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re pricey, so that&#x27;s a drawback, but they work so I&#x27;ll keep buying them for as long as I can afford them.&lt;br /&gt;Note: I clean the pads with soap toward the end of their usefulness, but not too soon. You can still wear them even if the edges start to lose their stickiness as long as most of the center is still adhering.&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE 10/28/15** Received a defective pad--it happens--so I contacted the seller directly. FANTASTIC customer service. I really can&#x27;t say enough nice things about them. (no, I don&#x27;t work for the company) I still use the pads and my lines have faded a lot even though I still sleep on my side. Just a great product that does what I expect it to. Will continue buying them for as long as they exist. ~cpiton</li>
    <li> It really works, but you do have to wear it nightly but at 56, be glad to for the results</li>
    <li> thick and hot, gets dirty, even after cleaning I worry about the problems from prolonged use could create</li>
    <li> The product performed according to description, my d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; area has improved from using it.  I do wish it lasted a bit longer but it did last a month.  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> These pads work amazing for crease lines on your chest. They don&#x27;t last 30 wearings, especially if you wear it all night. But a few hours before an outing really works wonders. Only drawback is they are so expensive, otherwise, i love the results!</li>
    <li> This product really does work. In the morning if I have lines on my chest from sleeping on my side, I place this pad on for a while and the wrinkles disappear!</li>
    <li> UPDATE 09.29.16: I bought one of these recently to wear under my Intimia bra pillow and it lasted for a full 40 days. I am using the micellar water with a cotton pad and let that dry before applying it. Then I got my second one, I took a picture of it you can see it here. It got sticky like this after one week. Balls of it was sticking on my chest and I did nothing different. I think I got a defective one. I will try it once more to see if it lasts at least 40 days. END UPDATE I bought like 4 of these in a row and then got tired of losing money like this so I finally I relented and bought the Intima breast pillow which has lasted me more than a year now and is working. Probably not like a silicone sheet would because those stick directly on your skin (before they lose their stickiness that is) but it does keep the &amp;#34;twins&amp;#34; apart and is very comfortable once you get the right fit (adjusting the straps).</li>
    <li> I bought this and thought it would be just a gimmick but I used it last night and I have to say, it dramatically reduced the indent of chest lines when I took it off this morning (I wore it all night). I was quite impressed.  I&#x27;m not sure how long the adhesive will last but I will consider getting another one.  I&#x27;m in my late thirties and only beginning to get chest lines from lying on my side but they are strong enough to notice and fade during the day.  But this morning, they were hardly noticable when I got up.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. You put it on either at night or in the morning before getting dressed. It refines and wrinkles that you may have from too much sun or sleeping on your side. Love it! I have purchased this product 3 times and will again.</li>
    <li> It does seem to take away wrinkles temporarily&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure about the long term effects&lt;br /&gt;I guess it is how you sleep that causes the wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;And how much sun damage or wrinkles you have&lt;br /&gt;But I did notice a difference after wearing it for several hours in the day&lt;br /&gt;I just wish the adhesive would be better !!&lt;br /&gt;I wish there was a different way to apply it so that it can work its benefits !!!!!</li>
    <li> I also was skeptical about this product but after only a few days of use, I was amazed by the results! My only complaint is I wish the pads would last a bit longer for the cost. I have maintained the pads as instructed but by third week they start to lose enough adhesive that it becomes loose around the edges and generally less effective. That said, overall I&#x27;ve been extrememly pleased with the results and if the manufacturer could get them to last closer to a month; I would give it 5 stars across the board!</li>
    <li> This definitely works...just a matter of remembering to wear every night.</li>
    <li> At 43 the wrinkles on my chest from side sleeping were no longer disappearing anytime during the day.  They started forming about a year and a half ago.  It was really starting to bother me to the point that I even tried to force myself to sleep on my back all the time - which didn&#x27;t work for very long.  I had been wondering for a long time if there was any solution to the issue.  Let me tell you ladies, this is it!!  After one night I noticed a complete difference.  Last night was my 3rd night and it gets better every morning.  I only wish the pads were larger so they could cover more of the upper chest.  I HIGHLY recommend this product!  I ordered 4 more today on a special that is buy 3 get one free and free shipping.  I am so excited to be able to wear normal tops again this summer!</li>
    <li> The positive reviews prompted me to give this a try.  Spending time in the sun has led to some unattractive wrinkling which is really noticable when I wake up in the morning.  I try to find clothing to button higher up so no &#x27;wrinkled cleavage&#x27; can be seen.  In just one use there was a huge difference in what I saw in the morning.  I purchased 2 more - another for me and one for mom.  I do wish the adheasive was a little more durable, but a lot has to do with forgetting NOT to apply lotion after a bath.  Recommend Highly</li>
    <li> Quick &amp; fast response. Delivery is efficient.  As far as the product goes-have not tried yet , but when I do will let you know if it really works.</li>
    <li> These are amazing!  The only issue I have is they do not last an entire 30 days and replacements are pricey.</li>
    <li> I just used for the first time; peeled it off and wrinkes were GONE&lt;br /&gt;I  hope results are permanent</li>
    <li> My wife wanted these.  I personally don&#x27;t think she needed anything as she really doesn&#x27;t have appreciable lines or wrinkles, but as with most folks, the problem looks more severe to her than it does to me (or anyone else I think).  Anyway, she&#x27;s been using it for a few weeks now and she reports that she thinks it is helping some.  Not a lot, but some. So there you have it.</li>
    <li> Work to stop lines on chest getting worse.</li>
    <li> I can see how this product would be great if it wasn&#x27;t so expensive and the stickiness didn&#x27;t rub off within the first week.  I was extremely careful to put the pad on a clean, dry area as recommended.  Not all of the stickiness rubbed off but the top half was useless after the first week.</li>
    <li> Have developed vertical lines between my breasts (large breasted, sun worshipper).  Even contacted plastic surgeon about laser and filler repair.  Found these while out in California on vacation and have been wowed!!  They absolutely work.  I had pretty pronounced lines and they are gone.  I do wear mine every night and they do collect dead skin cells and even with washing mine only last about 3 weeks - but my decollete looks gorgeous again.  I am sold and would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> I was not sure about the Silcskin Decollette Pad but being a side sleeper I needed something! So I ordered one and I&#x27;m so shocked!! I&#x27;m 46 and those Decollette wrinkles get worse every year.&lt;br /&gt;When I wear the pad at night , I wake up to a wrinkle free Decollette 👏👏</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It absolutely does smooth out chest wrinkles. I would highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> It is the best wrinkle pad when you are sleeping. I woke up with no chest wrinkles and I&#x27;m so happy with this product. Definitalety recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> For the price, I expected this produt to work much better.    First of all, this pad is way too big for my chest.  I am not a petite person, 5&#x27;6\\&quot; 135 lbs, 34-C bra size.  I placed the pad on my cleavage at the bottom and it went clear up to my collar bone at the top. It would stay on fine while sitting or standing, but once I layed down, the sides immediately pealed off.  So, I ended up cutting the triangle shape into an oval shape, and it sticks on a little better now.      I will say that my \\&quot;cleavage wrinkles\\&quot; are a little better now (I&#x27;ve worn it three nights), but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth the price tag.</li>
    <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving this product five stars is because it is pretty expensive to have the adhesive stop working after two weeks. I wash it with light hand soap and water every so often, it doesn&#x27;t take away the adhesive but keeps it clean. However, if you wear a bunch of lotion on your chest it will make the adhesive come off faster...to me I don&#x27;t care because I&#x27;d rather have lotion on my chest then be dry, because being dry causes more wrinkles. I love this product, I wish the adhesive worked better and I wish it was larger so it went over my collarbone.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive this product.  I followed all of the instructions about cleaning the skin of all moisturizers.  It stayed on about an hour, and then started to peal off.  Several times in the night it came off completely.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Noticed that I was getting &#x27;those wrinkles&#x27; on my chest (I&#x27;m a side-sleeper)... and wanted to do something about it. This is AWESOME! You put it on when you go to bed. The warmth of the body softens the silicone a bit - and you dont even notice it. In the morning - VOILA - no chest wrinkles. Im a D cup - and it is perfect (other similar &#x27;pillow-type&#x27; products are too clumsy). Makes for a nicer look w/ my scoop-neck shirts!</li>
    <li> I did as directions said but it only was usable for a few weeks. I loved the product itself, if it could last longer.</li>
    <li> Too hot and ended up with a nasty rash :(.  Worn for 2 weeks at bedtime saw little positive results.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!! Bought this as a gift for my stepmom. She is a lifelong sun worshiper and side sleeper. She swears that this thing makes a huge difference in her chest wrinkles. She is planning on ordering more as soon as this one doesn&#x27;t work anymore. I have used similar products for my 11&#x27;s eyebrow wrinkles and they really do make a big difference. Great product!!</li>
    <li> I am not easily swayed by &amp;#34;gadgets&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m not crazy about lines on my chest either so I gave these a try. I sleep on my side so I always had lines on my chest but not anymore. Transparent &amp; lightweight too. Wear this at night and you will wake up with no lines - You don&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s there! I gave one to my sister-in-law and she called me one day from work and she actually wore it to work because she forgot she had it on! Great Product.</li>
    <li> With back to back pregnancies, I&#x27;ve spent the last 3 years sleeping on my side. Probably not an issue for someone in their 20&#x27;s but I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s and cannot stand waking up with gross wrinkles on my chest! Worshipping the sun as a teen made the skin on my chest thin and damaged. Side sleeping has made it so much worse! It was too the point where I&#x27;d only wear higher neck shirts or like huge necklaces so that no one would notice my chest wrinkles. These things are a miracle--I&#x27;ve worn it ever night for the last 4 nights and no more deep wrinkles!  Of course, it hasn&#x27;t helped w/ the wrinkles I&#x27;ve developed over time---I&#x27;ll work on that with pricey creams and maybe laser treatments after this baby is born.  But those deep overnight wrinkles are gone and I&#x27;ll never have them again!  Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this product!! Oh and PS--you don&#x27;t even know you are wearing it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for the past 6 months or so, and I&#x27;m on my third one now.  I can definitely see a huge difference.  They are very comfortable--I pretty much forget I have it on after a couple of minutes.  My only complaint is that I wish they were slightly bigger, or maybe more Y-shaped to cover more areas.</li>
    <li> Tip; a little blast from the hair dryer increases stickiness. Wow, one night and my wrinkles were gone! I am 33 but after a breast augmentation and always sleeping on my side I was getting deep vertical lines in my chest.  I wore sunblock every day, moisturized at night and was doing series of acid peels and nothing was working. I was about to try Botox when I found this product. I like the size, it&#x27;s comfortable and it&#x27;s very sticky, it felt like a sticker on my chest. I had no discomfort sleeping and woke up with absolutely NO wrinkles. I am ordering one for every female on my Christmas list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 6/29/2012 Still very happy! If you cant get it to stay on overnight, a few hours of wear in the morning will smooth all day. I noticed that if I sweat it falls off easily, for those of you who have night sweats this proably won&#x27;t stay on. I wash or use toner my chest before sticking it on, if your chest has lotion or is not washed it won&#x27;t stick well. I use liquid handsoap to wash it, it is very sticky again after washing. I am a lifetime customer, very happy. I bought one for my mom but it made her breakout. I have not had any issues and I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This product is truly a miracle, the person who developed it should receive some acclaim.  If you don&#x27;t want your chest wrinkles and dryness to show than you must try this.  I wore it for one night, I switched it around to three different places during the night and the wrinkles and dryness were 90% gone!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  If you care about how you look especially during the summer with less on, this product is for you.  It is worth the price and I will continue to purchase it.  My chest area looks 25 years younger.  I have so far no problems with it adhering to my chest.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have ordered this product. It does work! It is not attractive, but serves the purpose.</li>
    <li> Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It gets dirty pretty fast - after about 2 weeks of daily use it significantly loses it&#x27;s sticking ability. It collects skin particles, tiny pieces of lint, etc no matter how hard you try to keep it clean. It says it&#x27;s washable but most particles get deep into the silicon to be easily removed by soap and water. To use it on regular bases you need to buy a new one every month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It gets the job done, and the results are clearly visible after the fist overnight use.</li>
    <li> I am a 62 year old female who sleeps on her side.  I was getting the \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; chest when I found this product.  What a difference!  It really works and I will use it forever.  The only downside is that it must be replaced about every other month but people, it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and it didn&#x27;t last for a month, not even two weeks. very disappointed. I have used these in the past and they have lasted for almost a month.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written a product review but I love this one and wanted to share. I&#x27;m 47, side sleeper and live in Florida. I started getting chest wrinkles in my 30s so by now, they were horrible and would never completely fade throughout the day although I moisturized like a fiend.  I started noticing in photos the most prominent thing would be my chest and its wrinkles. I hated it. I have used this pad for 2 nights and they are gone. Not decreased, but gone. I&#x27;ll probably have to continue to use it, at least on a part time basis but it&#x27;s so comfortable I don&#x27;t even realize it&#x27;s on in the night. As a bonus, I can still sleep on my side. I highly recommend. I&#x27;ve only been using for a couple of nights so haven&#x27;t experienced any issues with adhesion, etc but if I do I&#x27;ll just buy another because it works that well.</li>
    <li> Love it! I highly recommend it. It really works.  The best part of it is that it&#x27;s so easy to use and keep clean. I&#x27;m definitely going to keep using it! Waking up to no wrinkles on my chest is a confidence booster and a great way to start my day!</li>
    <li> This is the best beauty secret!  I will always buy this product.  My chest looks so much younger and prettier!</li>
    <li> This product does work well, but the adhesive doesn&#x27;t last long, 3 to 4 weeks at best.  For the price, it doesn&#x27;t seem worth the results.  Also, because I tend to sweat at night when I get over heated, the pad didn&#x27;t always stick very well.  I also developed a rash on my chest during the nights I sweated.  So all and all, this item simply didn&#x27;t provide enough pros to outweigh the cons for me.  I will say on the nights I didn&#x27;t sweat and I woke with the pad still firmly on, the wrinkle correction was amazing.  Smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  I have switched to a night bra sold by chestsavers.com in the hopes of ending chest wrinkles.  So far, so good.</li>
    <li> I get wrinkles all the time when I sleep, because I sleep on my side. I also have big boobs which creates wrinkles as well when you sleep. This works so well.</li>
    <li> I tried this and it did seem to work, however, the pad no longer sticks to me and it has only been 2 weeks since I started using it.  I would highly recommend this if it either came with replacement pads or if it did stay adhesive longer.  I&#x27;m currently looking for a replacement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve followed the instructions and the additional instructions left by other users (Thank you!)and so far at week 3 mines still sticking almost as much today as the first day.  However, even the first night I found that if I sleep fully on my side it will pop off in the middle.  At first I couldn&#x27;t get much sleep because I was worried about it falling off and wasting the whole pad, but now I&#x27;ve learned to stick back on in my sleep for the most part... And I&#x27;ve found I sleep less on my side because of that and more and more often I wake up on my back.  And I&#x27;ve also found (as long as I get it on straight at night and don&#x27;t bunch my skin under it either upon placement or in my sleep during replacement) I wake up with out any deep wrinkles.  I am enjoying that, but now my age spots are attracting my eye more... If it&#x27;s not one thing it&#x27;s another... I will probably buy another pad as long as I can make this one last 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> I am a lifelong side sleeper and in the last few years, my chest has started to show this.  I saw the pads at a little boutique and thought how in the world can they possibly work?  The owner was there and said she was skeptical at first, but she wanted to try them out before she put them out in the store and she couldn&#x27;t stop raving.  So I bought one without expecting anything, but after ONE night, my pretty deep lines were GONE.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it!  It is very comfortable to wear and it is barely noticeable.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars though is because it can make you look a little red/rashy when you take it off (I sleep with it so maybe I am leaving on to long?).  The red disappears after about an hour though.  Still, if you have sensitive skin, start slow.  I tell all my friends about themand they love them too!</li>
    <li> Oddly enough, this actually works.  Really well.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work all that great.  It takes a little bit of the wrinkles, but you can still see them.  The other one I had worked better.</li>
    <li> Works well but for the price it should last a lot longer - max 2 weeks and then it loses its stick.</li>
    <li> I does a pretty good job if I wear it every night.  It is much better than the one that is a pillow type.  I wish it would stay sticky over a longer period of time.  If Cleaning according to instructions is  must!</li>
    <li> I buy these every month or two and sleep with it on all night, it truly is a miracle. Does lose its stickiness after time but still worth it.  Or you can just use it in the morning to fix the wrinkles instead of preventing them, they plump right out. Was amazed the first morning!</li>
    <li> This literally does not work. I am amazed at the number of people who say that it does anything for them at all. If I could return this for a refund immediately I would. It sticks well, and that&#x27;s about it. I gave it time before I wrote my review, but it does not do what it says it would. I am a youngish person (mid 30&#x27;s) so it&#x27;s not as if I am an older person and it wouldn&#x27;t do anything for me regardless of what I tried. I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this product and I have purchased it before. However, it seemed a little smaller this time. In actuality in order to cover my chest I need to order two, which is quite expensive. I wish they would make a large size.</li>
    <li> I have bought so many products over the years for anti-aging and this pad actually removes wrinkles on  your chest.  It is great.  I hightly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> They work awesome. My wrinkles were GONE overnight. However, the pad is too small to cover my chest and they only last 10-15 days instead of the 30-60 promised.That was a huge disappointment as they are not cheap.</li>
    <li> The ONLY thing that works for getting rid of and preventing chest wrinkles. I use it every night. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> Like everyone else I thought this was probably too good to be true.  But since there is no real risk other than a few bucks, I decided to try.  At 45 my chest wrinkles were really making me look older than my age. After just one night I saw a huge difference!  I have a reaction to latex, and have never had silicone on my skin, so I wasn&#x27;&#x27;t sure if I would have an issue, but I am happy to say I had no problems or reactions.  Now if someone could just invent something like this for the neck, I could look 20 years younger!  I am completely happy and satisfied with this product and will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Smooth Decollete after first use, you need to keep using it, its not a magic line eraser, but it works! :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how or why this works but it does! After using it for one night my wrinkles have disappeared on my chest. I want to put it on my eyes and face but it is not advisable to do so. For many years I have baked in the sun in lately I have been putting on more sunscreen. This erased the years of sun damage. Just amazing!</li>
    <li> Works phenomenally for about 3 days.  Works great for another 3 - 4 days.  Stickiness begins to wear off and will work okay for another week or so.  After that it really doesn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
    <li> I hate to be without it for even one night - I love it ten years taken off in one product.</li>
    <li> Tried this and it works but does not last for an entire month. More like 2 weeks. Secondly, is it sustainable to spend this much money every two weeks? Of course not. Great if you have a party to go to and your chest is looking crab appleish and you have a few weeks to tweak it but not for long term reconditioning.</li>
    <li> If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. I bought two of these, tried one, tossed it in the garbage after a week, and am now returning the other one. They don&#x27;t stay stuck to your skin for very long, and feel heavy and thick as you move around at night. Perhaps the silicone would work if it were thinner and stuck better, but I don&#x27;t know, and will never know, I guess. Do not waste your money on this product. I don&#x27;t understand where all the good reviews are coming from: perhaps they are fake/paid reviews?! Wish I&#x27;d never ordered this!</li>
    <li> This decollette pad works so well for stopping wrinkles in the center of my chest.  I also have some scars there and it helps to diminish them.  I did find that I need to wash every  morning or it won&#x27;t stick so well.</li>
    <li> This product is a miracle. I&#x27;m a 44 year old side-sleeping sun-worshipper. I go to sleep with three vertical pronounced crepey chest wrinkles and then wake up with smooth skin. It is light, comfortable to wear, and affordable. I&#x27;ve never tried to wash one of them; simply since I don&#x27;t think it would work as well after that? So I simply discard it when it stops sticking...usually after about three weeks or so. I don&#x27;t consider it to be costly considering the tremendous difference it makes in the appearance of my skin. I ADORE it.</li>
    <li> I love these pads - yes a bit pricey but they do work.  If kept clean they do last about a month or just under..one has to keep using them if they are going to continue side sleeping.  They are a temporary fix (and probably more effective for those bet 30-55 years of age or with moderate lines) I am happy with the results for sure.</li>
    <li> I love the way I woke up without vertical wrinkles on my chest. This product works very well! But, unfortunately, I can&#x27;t continue to use it because I am sensitive to something in the adhesive. I got a sort of reddish rash/bumps after using it 4 or 5 few times.</li>
    <li> Have used this for a couple of months now and definitely can tell a difference when I wake up in the morning. The most noticeable was when I took a nap this afternoon and didn&#x27;t wear the pad. When I woke up, I noticed the wrinkles on my chest immediately from not wearing it. It loses adhesiveness after about 2-3 months, so then it&#x27;s time for another one. It&#x27;s very comfortable to wear, and I don&#x27;t notice it at all when I sleep. My husband calls it my \\&quot;superman shield\\&quot; - says it looks like one, ha!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a large busted woman who is a side sleeper.  I&#x27;ve tried to re-train myself to sleep on my back, but so far all that amounts to is sleepless nights spent in uncomfortable positions.  In my mid-30&#x27;s I started to notice that my decolletage was not the smooth, creamy skin of my youth.  I love showing off my cleavage, and these help take my skin back in time.  I wear them every night to bed.  I don&#x27;t have a problem with them coming off while I sleep, and my skin looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find that keeping your skin and the pad clean (washing your skin before bed and the pad about once a week) is effective at preventing any clogged pores which could lead to blemishes.</li>
    <li> This pad works as described. Even if you can&#x27;t wear it all night, you can wear it for 30 minutes and still getositive results. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I think this product works well. I does help those ugly lines between the breasts, BUT it always leaves me red and irritated after a night of sleeping with the pad. I wish this wasn&#x27;t the case, but it is! I also notice that the pad leaves a crease at the top center of the chest, which goes away within an hour or so... but in my opinion shouldn&#x27;t happen, as it defeats the purpose overall, right? Cleaning the pad is easy. It does get pretty yucky if you don&#x27;t care for it after each use. I even trimmed the pad a bit to make it fit better. I would prefer a smaller pad, as most of my fine lines are in the center of the upper chest from sleeping, not so much between the breasts due to age. Overall, I recommend the Calvet pad, but not for everybody, as it is very irritating if left on all night.</li>
    <li> worked well for a few days.  I even washed with with dish soap like some people recommended.  That helped a lot.  But it would only last for a couple of days again.  After doing this for a while it eventually stopped sticking and would fall off.  I always made sure I washed my skin so it was free of oils.  Not worth the price.  I have gotten others that have lasted a long time.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I&#x27;m at that age where the chest wrinkles have set in and they&#x27;re getting worse because I sleep on my sides.  This pad is so easy to use that I use it every night.  In the morning the wrinkles are greatly diminished.  I would recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to have to wear a turtleneck all the time.  One thing to remember, is KEEP the plastic sheet that covers it so you can put it back over it when you&#x27;re not using it.</li>
    <li> When I received this product I was so excited, I sleep on my side so that is where my lines come from.  I followed the directions and put it on and went to bed. When I woke up and peeled it off, the results were outstanding!! I was very impressed, you need to be consistant with this product because the results fade after a day. When used for an hour the results do not last long at all so I suggest you sleep with this on. If you are in a hurry and need a quick fix for an event or special night then put it on for an hour and it will do the trick for the evening. What a great product and a good alternative to plastic surgery, not to mention Way more affordable! I now use this product along with an anti wrinkle chest cream and it&#x27;s working great. Always make sure your chest is clean with no creams or lotions on it before applying, put the chest cream on After you peel off the pad. I hope this review helps :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 29 Years old (with horrible, pale, easily damaged skin) and when I sleep I&#x27;m wrapped in a tiny ball, lying on my side with my head tucked to my chest, needless to say my neck and chest look like that of a 55 year old, seriously my grandma has less wrinkles! So this is my first morning waking up after using it, not a wrinkle on my chest!  I was so excited I wanted to write a review. WARNING: I cannot comment on everlasting stickiness but effectiveness was an absolute 10! Can we make some for my neck now please?! Oh and BTW it was very comfortable to sleep with and it doesn&#x27;t stand out to the point of my husband cracking any jokes.  For people reading this I hope it continues to work and just know I am a very skeptical person, I&#x27;m a nurse and realize that the majority of Anti Aging claims are crap.  This is like botox for your chest, you stabilize the skin and it will crease less&#x3D;fact.</li>
    <li> Its not worth the money.... After a few uses and you wash it.. It gets &amp;#34;gummed up&amp;#34; and wont come clean. If you sleep with it on all night the outline of it stays on long after you shower and you chest looks horrible...better off buying a cosmetic wrinkle cream...</li>
    <li> I have been using these for many years now.  i love them!  Most women my age (50) are so wrinkled in this area.  Not me, thanks to these pads.  If you wash them once a week, they will last longer.  I try to always keep several on hand so i am never without.  Great product.</li>
    <li> It is a good product, just too much trouble to have to wash it every day, this is my second one and have not used it yet., so many different things to do on my face before going to bed!! but it is ok</li>
    <li> Does not stay on if you are a side sleeper (which is the whole point of buying one, to prevent the wrinkling resulting from side sleeping). It rolls and peels off. Works great if it stays on, but otherwise not worth the price.</li>
    <li> This works great for awhile...then  the adhesive wears very quickly. Then it doesn&#x27;t work at all...only last about a month. I&#x27;ve purchased two...this will be the last. I&#x27;ll come up w/something else.</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;m 52 and being a side-sleeper for my whole life. In my young years I started to have big deep wrinkles in the morning, but then they would disappear. Probably, due to lack of collagen in women&#x27;s skin with aging, wrinkles did not go away anymore, but were becoming deeper and deeper, leaving me at the point where I started to avoid open-neck clothes. After doing my research I stopped my choice on D&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; Pad.&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, hear me out! IT DOES WORK!! It&#x27;s a little bit uncomfortable, but the result is great. You don&#x27;t have to wear it every night; I personally choose it for every other night. In the morning, when you peel it off, your chest is wrinkleless and the skin is smooth. Oh, forgot to mention, I used it for four weeks now and more than grateful to its inventors and producers. I highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000PARERW Decollette Pad - Correct &amp; Prevent Chest Wrinkles, 1 pad,(Calvet Cosmetics)]]</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant about this product, but it does work.  I put it on before bed and wear over night.</li>
    <li> Wish I had these sooner. They are a miracle to me. U go to bed and wake up without creases. Amazing.</li>
    <li> wish they lasted longer - but they work!</li>
    <li> I love this product! It takes a few wears to get used to, but the results are amazing! I&#x27;m a side-sleeper and have been for years, and once I hit 40, the chest wrinkles decided to stick around for good. I have been using this product for a month now and could not be happier with the results! The lines are very fine in the morning and fade quickly, whereas before I started using this product, the chest lines were deep and would only lightly fade. Unlike some reviews, my pad has maintained good adhesion and I can probably stretch it to about 45 days before purchasing my next one - which I will!</li>
    <li> The pad bubbled and didn&#x27;t lay flat as I slept.  If you&#x27;re thinking of purchasing this, keep looking. Skip this item.</li>
    <li> I am a \\&quot;solution junkie\\&quot;! So, when I found these decollette pads, I was so excited! After the very first night of using them, my chest wrinkles were GONE.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using these pads for 3 years now when I noticed the wrinkles on my chest after sleeping on my side at the age of 38.  I was getting married and planned to wear a strapless wedding gown and needed a quick fix.  I asked my plastic surgeon and my dermatologist how to get rid of my chest wrinkles...they had no answers with the exception of botox.  I tried the botox and it was a total waste of money since it did not help at all....after researching on the internet, I found these pads and ordered one to try.  I also ordered the heart shaped thicker pad that is also offered on Amazon (did not work as well, was too bulky and uncomfortable!).  These pads are miracle workers! I buy them for my friends as gifts and they are in love with them.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the pads do not last as long as the manufacturer says.  I use a Clarisonic on my chest every night, I then apply astringent or witch hazel to really clean the skin before applying the pad.  The sticky-ness wears off after about 2 weeks even when washing them according to the instructions.  I know silicone is expensive and that is why the price is high, and luckily I can afford to buy 2 pads per month...I just think the pads should come in sets of two for this price.  It&#x27;s a shame because every girl should be able to afford to get rid of her chest wrinkles....&lt;br /&gt;Also, if I forget to wear my pad at night, I just put it on my chest in the morning while I am getting ready to go out and after an hour, the wrinkles are gone...maybe that is the solution to making them last longer.</li>
    <li> This is truly a great product. The ony negative I&#x27;ve read is that it doesn&#x27;t last. I found that if I clean my chest before with an astringent to remove dirt and oils, the patch last well over 30-60 days. Really smooths the lines.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely a great product.  It really works.  I tend to wear a lot of lower cut tops in the summer.  I am definitely a side sleeper. I am disappointed that they don&#x27;t last very long.  Washing them slightly with an anti-bacterial soap works.  It will appear to have completely lost it&#x27;s \\&quot;stickyness\\&quot; at this  point, but as it dries, the adhesive comes back to life.  I&#x27;ve had it for approximately 45 days.  It&#x27;s not misleading, because the instructions do say, \\&quot;lasts 30-60 day\\&quot;.  Follow the instructions.  It is well worth the money.  I&#x27;ve just ordered my second pad.  Trust me on this one.  I&#x27;m a beauty/anti-aging products freak.  One of the best!</li>
    <li> This is the secret to a wrinkle-free chest!</li>
    <li> This item is a miracle worker!  I will forever use this item. I am 50 years old and have alot of sun damage to my chest. I would awaken to deep creases in my chest due  .  To being a side sleeper. I would then try pressing really hard on these areas to reduce the creases.  After only three days of wearing this my chest looks 10 years younger because I no longer have c reasess when I awaken AND it also flattened out the creases I had!!!</li>
    <li> I felt the product did  nothing to improve the lines on my chest. This is what it advertises and it is the reason I purchased the product.&lt;br /&gt;I would like a refund. Very disappointed!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and excellent. I only wish I had thought of it! Research silicone pads/sheets and the amazing affect they have on healing scars and burns and you will understand why this also works on wrinkles. It has something to do with helping the body with collagen synthesis(making your skin stronger, like when you were young). I assure you, I would not be giving this review if I did not believe in this product completely. I am ashamed to say I have tried hundreds of products to help this problem: vertical wrinkles that develop because of aging skin along with sleeping on one&#x27;s side. Yes, it would help to sleep on my back, but let&#x27;s be realistic. I have tried that, and it lasted about a minute. If I could stop myself from turning on my side in my sleep, (which is natural), I would be able to fly, live forever, teleport, heal all the sick of the world, cure world hunger, rule the world, and stop war from happening, but that ain&#x27;t gonna happen, is it? I tried this one night, and my creases are almost gone. I am no spring chicken. I am 42, naturally auburn-haired, and fair-skinned-three strikes, right? Follow the directions for care. This is one of the only products I&#x27;ve spent money on that is truly worth it. Ladies, (and guys, if you have this problem), this is the holy grail of the decollette(chest wrinkles). Buy it. If it doesn&#x27;t work for you, I am truly sorry, but I plan on telling everyone I know about this amazing product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about two weeks, and I definitely notice a difference! Not only does the pad remove wrinkles, my skin appears healthier and smoother. I do find that my skin gets itchy if I wear for more than a couple hours, so I apply for an hour or so every other day.  I think I need to get one of these for my mom!</li>
    <li> Works well wish it lasted longer.seems to loose adhesion after 2 weeks..</li>
    <li> My previous 2 pads lasted for many months and were very effective,  my last order - not so much.  The adhesive quality of this last pad is poor, starting to lift during the 2nd night.  When the pad lifts from the skin it can not do what it&#x27;s intended to do.  Since I&#x27;m having such an entirely different experience with my last order and others have had problems with the adhesive, I&#x27;m wondering if the quality of the adhesive varies during production.  Based on this last experience I would not reorder.</li>
    <li> These décolleté pads really work well!</li>
    <li> Product was received timely and has performed as expected. Hopefully this product will last for a while, so far it&#x27;s been fine.</li>
    <li> this thing really works, but a bit pricey given it lasts 30 days +/-.  Wish it lasted longer, maybe design enhancement soon ?</li>
    <li> First review ever, that&#x27;s how amazing this thing is! 1 day and my chest wrinkles were gone! I&#x27;m only 30 but was already starting to see them and having anxiety about sleeping on my side. Now I can sleep however I want and when you take the sheet off in the morning the entire area is perfectly smooth!</li>
    <li> I have ordered these before and been very very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;This particular one I am not the least happy with.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t stick around the edges and often times comes partially un pealed.</li>
    <li> Worked within a few days for me and now I can&#x27;t live without it.  My marks were really bad, too.  I had been using a &amp;#34;boob pillow&amp;#34; for years, but while that kept the twins separated, it really didn&#x27;t keep the skin from wrinkling in between.  The pad keeps the skin taut and within a very short period of time, the lines disappeared.  I still use a combo of both, but the patch is doing most of the work.  I&#x27;m also one of those people that doesn&#x27;t like foreign things on me, so I DID have trouble getting used to the forehead patch (and subsequently, did not use it because of my own weirdness), but the decollette one is less bothersome.  Bottom line is that it works and how often can you say THAT about a product?</li>
    <li> A friend suggested this product to me for the wrinkles. caused by many, many years in the sun when i was in my teens and 20&#x27;s, and now i am in my early 60&#x27;s and the damage definitely shows!!! Great tan then, bad look now!  First night I tried the product, i noticed a difference the next morning!!!</li>
    <li> Caused me to break out in an itchy rash with blisters. Lasted for two weeks! Would never try again. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! They work well! I&#x27;m a side sleeper and since I&#x27;ve used these at night, I have absolutely NO chest wrinkles. They are very comfortable and I highly recommend them. The only downside is that they are a tad expensive. Other than that, I&#x27;m very happy with the results!</li>
    <li> Skeptical at first...but I was proven wrong the very first night of use. I expected a slight difference on the first use...not a complete change!  What a difference!  Definitely recommend cleaning your skin before use and washing the pad with soap/water to ensure it remains clean and sticky.  I would recommend this to anyone!  I&#x27;ve already purchased another one!</li>
    <li> These are MAGIC!!!  I use them all the time and wake up with a completely wrinkly free chest!  It&#x27;s unbelievable.!</li>
    <li> this has a distinct and definite effect. It is very expensive but if you have a special event, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had what I called my &amp;#34;Mississippi Delta&amp;#34; on my chest from sleeping on my side and sun damage over the years. I&#x27;ve been using this product nightly for about two months and am thrilled with how it&#x27;s working. There is a noticeable difference in the smoothness and texture of my skin. I&#x27;m about to order my third one, as I find it lasts me about thirty days.</li>
    <li> Has been a great travel pad.  I generally use the intima breast pillow, which also works wonderfully, but when used together, they make my d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; look years younger-absolutely no lines, and this one is great to just travel with if you can&#x27;t bring the pillow.  Stays in place well, I have had mine for about a year (not used every night) and believe it or not, it still stays in place when I use it.  Well made and works just as advertised.  I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Worked for 30 days, then lost its adhesiveness.  Too much money for too little use.  Was unable to return it and get money back.</li>
    <li> At last, something that actually seems to work!!!  I&#x27;ve only used it a few times and it really does seem to do the trick.  I&#x27;m using mine during the day/evening for a couple of hours at a time - not when sleeping.  I think it&#x27;s really very good and would definitely recommend this - great for preparing for an evening out or special occasion - I&#x27;m sure with regular use, it would be even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only comment is, I&#x27;m quite small framed and the triangle pad doesn&#x27;t cover &#x27;all&#x27; my chest - so I&#x27;m putting it on the worst area, so to speak.  A bigger pad would be brilliant but other than, I can wholeheartedly recommend it.  Well done the manufacturers!</li>
    <li> I developed chest wrinkles a few years ago when I was in my late 20s.  I assumed they were irreversible and the only way to get rid of them would be some sort of injection.  I thought I&#x27;d give this a shot, but was highly skeptical... but it actually worked.  I have a couple wrinkles that are probably permanent, but for the most part I can&#x27;t believe the change.  However, like many customers, I agree that these do not last as long as advertised.  I think you can make it work for about 3 weeks, then it&#x27;s time for a new one.  But it&#x27;s worth it in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Ditto to all the good comments everyone else has made.  I just want to add that if you have a small frame you should consider trying this one night and see how it fits.  Next day, look in a mirror and mark for cutting based on where it doesn&#x27;t fit.  Trim to size.  For me, when I lay down it pushes up higher on my chest and it bugs me.  Trimming it or applying it much lower than you think you should will help.  Also, I use one of those thin, flexible cutting sheets made out of plastic to store it on. They are about the size of a placemat of 8.5x11 sheet of paper and perfect for this use.  Now, if anyone knows what kind of glue is applied to the back to make it stick, let us all know!  It wuld make an expensive piece of silicone last longer.</li>
    <li> This is the best Silc Skin product.  I have the Forehead one, the multi facial one and the reviews are correct - this one actually stays put.  I notice a difference and am happy with this product.  I don&#x27;t understand why the other products don&#x27;t adhere like this one ???????</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a side sleeper so I&#x27;ve been looking for a way to prevent permanent chest wrinkles. I wanted to be one of the positive reviews, unfortunately, It didn&#x27;t stick to my skin, even after wiping the area with alcohol to remove any excess oil or moisturizer.  The pad would fall off within a few hours of falling asleep or if I moved around at all. I tried for 6 nights and finally gave up. It was an expensive trial as I&#x27;m now outside the 30 day return window. The search for the ultimate anti-wrinkle product continues...</li>
    <li> I love it, it works really good, just doesn&#x27;t really stick much longer than 1-2 weeks, especially in summer when you sweat more. I fix it and keep it in place with small band aids at the edges.</li>
    <li> Buy it, what do you have to lose...it works. I don&#x27;t use them everyday but when the weather gets warmer I sure will!</li>
    <li> The product does help tremendously with chest wrinkles from sleeping on my side. However as other reviews mentioned the &amp;#34;stickiness&amp;#34; of the silicone only lasts about 2 weeks. I am exploring other similar products to see if I can find one that lasts longer.</li>
    <li> I love these pads. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks and there is a real difference. Yeah, it&#x27;s temporary I&#x27;m sure, but when you use it every night, you renew the effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 49 and was starting to feel like my chest is what gave my age away first. I started wearing higher tops and no necklaces to draw your attention to it. After the first night wearing this pad, I could see the difference. I wake up in the morning to smooth skin. Some nights I put up higher, closer to my neck, other nights in the middle of my chest. I&#x27;m wearing whatever top I like and necklaces again. I could not be happier with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last, and even if it lasts 60 days, I do think it&#x27;s still over priced. I&#x27;ve washed it once so far and the stickiness got better, so I&#x27;m hopeful I can go the full 60 days with it. I also wear a t-shirt to bed, which I&#x27;m sure helps keep it in place.</li>
    <li> This is magical.  It really works.  I wish I had known about this years ago.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> It definitely works but only keeps its adherence for about 2 weeks. This is a good product but would be great if it lasted longer.</li>
    <li> This is a really good thing to have if you are busty to help battle lines in your chest, and it really does make a big difference.</li>
    <li> This does exactly what I need it to: it stops the wrinkles that appear on my chest from side sleeping.  If I don&#x27;t use it, I wake up with wrinkles that run up from my chest to my neck and they tend to last quite a while!  If I use this, they don&#x27;t appear.  It makes my decollette look the correct age;)</li>
    <li> Very impressessed with these little pads.  I could see a difference after just one night!  I had some expensive laser treatments on my chest a while back to deal with the wrinkles in my décolleté area and these pads were more effective than that proceedure.  I highly recommend this product.  I have discovered that if you go directly to the munafacturers site, they offer a buy 3 and get one free promo.</li>
    <li> working very well and lasting log time</li>
    <li> I bought mine from Resource Salon in Idaho, while on vacation.  I love it.  The facialist that sold it to me said to extend the use, wash it with non-oily cleanser after each use and lightly blow dry it.  It keeps sticking and working like a charm. Hello summer tops with open necklines.</li>
    <li> The cost and frequency you may have to buy them seems put people off, but if take care if and use it properly, it should last at least 2 months like mine did. Always place on clean dry skin (No lotions or creams or gels)., and keep it in a plastic container such as flat bottomed zip lock container. If it gets hairs or dust on in, gently wash it with a mild soup and  leave it in the container to dry. I think most beauty products are  crap, but this one I will vouch for.</li>
    <li> I can wear this for as little as 30 minutes and it smooth&#x27;s out all those lines.  Highly recommend this for anyone! Easily washable and re-useable.</li>
    <li> Does what it says. A little pricey for the life of the pad, still is the best out there</li>
    <li> 45yr old/side sleeper/tanner/with the super wrinkle gene. I purchased one of these pads 3yrs ago and I am just now coming back to purchase a second. The first one is still sticky and works great! I just want a second to leave in my travel bag so I won&#x27;t have to pack/unpack. Maybe I purchased during a peak batch or something because I&#x27;ve read the other reviews. One thing is I&#x27;ve never ever washed this sucker. Yeah right..wash that sticky right off so I can reorder in a month?</li>
    <li> Works well.  I don&#x27;t sleep in it, but instead put it on after I shower and when I&#x27;m  putting on makeup and doing my hair. It smooths out lines.</li>
    <li> At 29 I am already seeing the damage I have done by being a beach bum all of these years on my chest! I searched the web and found SilcSkin Decollette Pad. I purchased it and gave it a try. It definitely works in that (if it stays on all night) you have noticeably less wrinkles and lines on your chest come morning time. I toss and turn quite a bit and for about 3 weeks it manages to stay on. It takes a night or two to get used to and after that I don&#x27;t even notice I have it on. It does get pretty yucky with hair, skin, anything because it is literally just a sticky pad (think of those Schticky infomercials because it is basically the same thing, but just in the shape of a pad you put on your chest with a non-schticky side) . After 3 weeks of regular use it does lose its stick and you need to get a new one. For this reason I gave it 4 stars because it is pretty pricey especially if you have to buy a new one every month or so! So you basically need to decide if you are willing to pay the price for a nicer décolletage!</li>
    <li> These do work for me. I have been using for years. They will not cure you though haha unless you learn to sleep on your back!  They only last about 2 weeks for me. Sometimes I can get three out of them but never 30 uses.  I wish they were not so expensive!</li>
    <li> The pad does work--yes, it loses it&#x27;s adhesive before sixty days, but it does what it claims: lessens appearance of wrinkles, if only temporarily.</li>
    <li> I tried this without my hopes too high. I lived on a beach for years so my chest really could use some pampering. I&#x27;ve only used this twice, but its already appreciated. My boyfriend doesn&#x27;t appreciate as much as I do of course, but I can wear it under a shirt. So far its worth every penny. I will try to update this after a few months.</li>
    <li> Do chest wrinkles that took years to form ever totally go away?  Not really; however, they can be drastically minimized....and this product has helped in that regard for me.  The only thing I can say about the pad is that it looses it&#x27;s adhesiveness a little prematurely.  The fact that you can wash it with antibacterial soap, let it dry, and reuse it is great.  I only wish the pad itself was larger and could span a bigger chest area.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I keep repurchasing these pads even though the price is outrageous because they do effectively prevent those chest wrinkles from sleeping on my side. The sticky side is hard to manage, but does work with careful handling.</li>
    <li> I really think these help but hard to get used to wearing - I&#x27;m trying to be more regular with wearing them each night!!</li>
    <li> These work great I have used them for years. They totally remove the lines on the chest that women get when your older from sleeping on your side. Buy one and try it you wont regret it.</li>
    <li> Not sure yet, but so far so good</li>
    <li> Does what it says it&#x27;ll do. Keeps my decollette nice and smooth while I sleep. I&#x27;ve had mine about a three weeks now, and it seems like it has a couple more weeks left on this baby, max. It&#x27;s a pricey way to keep the boobies wrinkle free, but I&#x27;m probably willing to pay it until I decide I&#x27;m okay with a crepey bust.</li>
    <li> love it has helped a lot very hydrating</li>
    <li> They are not very sturdy they bend off when you side sleep.  They don&#x27;t stay on very good they don&#x27;t last 30 days. Expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a heavier padded silicone heart pillow, but this light &amp; thin pad is the best! You have to follow directions for best results (wash with warm water and NONmoisturizing soap) to make it last the 30 day minimum that the product promises. It makes you feel more confident when you wear a low or v neckline shirt, as it certainly does minimize wrinkles on the chest area.</li>
    <li> It does work; major reduction in wrinkles in the morning, but pad does not last long, it&#x27;s pricey and I found it to be very uncomfortable and hot. It felt very foreign and made it hard to sleep. I wish it was more comfortable, and more affordable.</li>
    <li> This really, really works. It&#x27;s annoying, and thank god I am single - how do you wear this sucker to bed with a mate? I mean - I guess if you wear pajamas?</li>
    <li> This product works. You need to get used to it but it does work. Mine lasted around 30 days. I am a side sleeper and this really works. If I could retrain myself to sleep on my back I definitely would age better. I can now see wrinkles on my cheeks from side sleeping! I wonder if they sell silicone under eye pads?</li>
    <li> I am 32. I have always slept on my side. I have premature cleavage wrinkles because of this. I have very white skin and these wrinkles made me look way older than I really am. This is the first thing I noticed in the mirror when I woke up. They made me a little unconfident for the rest of my day. I have tried creams, but the real problem is sleeping on your side. That can&#x27;t really be changed. I have only tried this product for one day and the wrinkles where barely there when I woke up :) It works. I can live with the price. If you are tired of your chest wrinkles you should give it a try.</li>
    <li> Good product but I hardly seen any difference when using it. Over time (within 1 week) the product does not stick that well.</li>
    <li> Wear one of these the night before a decollete revealing top day and and no reason to wear a busy necklace to cover up. Skin is perfectly smooth.</li>
    <li> This really works!  I have tried everything and this is fantastic. I&#x27;m in love! :-)  I would like to make suggestion to the maker of this.  I have tried every non oily soap to clean it to no avail.  It will not clean and because of that, it loses it&#x27;s stickiness quickly.  Is there a way, considering the price is a bit high , to add a cleanser to go with it that will clean it properly?    Also, is it possible to make the top part a little bit wider, too?</li>
    <li> Great product!  Just needs to be used consistently!</li>
    <li> I am 46, I have semi-heavy breasts and I sleep on my side and stomach.  I have had DEEP chest wrinkles because of this and haven&#x27;t worn open necked shirts in at least 10 years because I am so self conscious about the creases on my chest.  Not any more!  I wake up in the morning and my chest is really smooth.  My wrinkles were so deep that every last trace hasn&#x27;t disappeared quite yet, but after 3 weeks the difference is night and day. There is only the slightest hint of a trace of the lines on my chest (but you have to look really hard to see them) and I swear those are continuing to lessen day by day as I use the pads.  I am no longer self conscious, not one bit.  This was such a difficult problem to address before these pads.  There was really nothing that worked for me including some products that otherwise got good reviews. I hope to never sleep another night without them.    It would be nice if they were a little less expensive.  They can&#x27;t cost THAT much to make.  I washed mine regularly and have found that the adhesion is starting to let up after 3 weeks.  The inventor of this product deserves to become fabulously wealthly - I just hope s/he can do it by selling a lot of these at a bit lower price.  There is a buy 3 get 1 free deal on another website and that helps, but they are still a little steep even with the discount in my opinion.</li>
    <li> What an interesting product. I&#x27;m 45, and starting to see some pretty serious wrinkling on my chest ... particularly first thing in the morning (I sleep on my side). The morning after wearing this pad, my chest was much smoother than it had been previously. It definitely reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles (to borrow a phrase from every face cream ever marketed.) It&#x27;s pretty comfortable, too. I thought I&#x27;d be bothered by it all night, but because it&#x27;s flexible, it didn&#x27;t feel too restrictive. The sticky side of the pad does get pretty gunky after a few wearings, though, and washing it doesn&#x27;t seem to change that. Still, I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> It works! I was skeptical when I ordered it, but the reviews are correct. It really does decrease chest wrinkles.  You&#x27;ll need to use it every day to keep up the improved appearance. I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months and it still hasn&#x27;t lost it&#x27;s &amp;#34;stick.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Love it need to order another soon</li>
    <li> Only thing that Really works is Lazer</li>
    <li> fantastic, these work amazing. I just wish they were a little less expensive. I was really concerned with wearing lower cut shirts with the creases that were developining on my chest. Now I can wear any blouse with out feeling like everyone was looking at the creases.</li>
    <li> This really works. Although these lines are fine....they are not attractive. I was hesitant but after reading the reviews I thought all these people must know something. Sleeping one night, no problem ....no lines the next day! Using it every night terrific! Goodbye  plastic surgeon!</li>
    <li> After researching and reading many different reviews, I am so happy I took a chance on SilcSkin. After the very first night I slept with this pad, I was amazed.  My husband could not believe the difference.  My sister asked if I had some sort of filler put in my lines and I said &amp;#34;NOPE!&amp;#34;  I bought her a SilckSkin Decollette Pad and she too, wears each night to bed and is very happy, too.  It is not a permanent solution but with consistency you can enjoy the daily results for a long time.  I have been using this same pad for almost 2 months, cleaning periodically and storing as recommended and it is still staying in place and the sticky side is good as new.  Give a try, you will be glad you did.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts but I figured for the price, it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;I seen a total difference after one night.&lt;br /&gt;I now use this every night and I no longer see the wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Best $30 every spent.</li>
    <li> Where have you been all my life.  Erases those pesky lines in almost two days.  I will be living with this a while.</li>
    <li> I am 41 and this year started noticing chest wrinkles when I&#x27;d wake up although they would disappear in a few hours. I originally purchased this product through Solutions magazine. Although I was skeptical, I was willing to try it and I LOVE it! No wrinkles!! I used my first pad for nearly 3 months. I ended up trimming the top of the pad after a couple months since the stickiness seemed to wear there first. It stayed on better without the weight. You can also wash these since sometimes hair gets stuck in them at night if your hair is longer. One tip, make sure you DON&#x27;T lotion your chest at night before wearing. It won&#x27;t stick as well. I ordered from AMazon since it was the best price that included shipping. This time I bought 2 since shipping was only a dollar more and I will be using these for a LONG time!</li>
    <li> This really has helped with the wrinkles I get in the chest area.  I sleep on my side, and so I get wrinkles or sleep lines which don&#x27;t go away easily.  This pad is great, it keeps the skin from folding into wrinkles, and makes me look a little younger I think.  It does seem to need replaced once a month or so because if fuzz and stuff that gets stuck on the pad.  I tried washing it, which helps some, but plan on replacing within a couple or three months. Great product.</li>
    <li> Bought two &#x3D; first one last a month as expected, second one lasted only two weeks. But work for me.</li>
    <li> These pads are amazing!! I&#x27;m 58 and have been applying these pads for 1yr the results are incredible!&lt;br /&gt;I had deep wrinkles on my decollette and between my breasts which prevented me from wearing clothes that revealed this area.  I wear a pad at night while I sleep, if I go a few days without using the pads I definitely notice the wrinkles being more obvious.  The pads do not make my deep wrinkles disappear completely, but they do improve the problem about 80% and I feel better about me!  Each pad lasts for up to 2-1/2mths. with nightly use.</li>
    <li> Used daily it works great.</li>
    <li> Im a side sleeper and started to wake up with lines on my chest, im 35 and was not happy. So went to google found these on amazon and they work, stuck it on and no lines the next morning.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. This pad will not adhere to your skin long enough throughout the night to make any sort of difference. A min. amount of perspiration will immediately cause it to come loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I think it&#x27;s most unsanitary. You cannot wash the silicone pad yet you are expected to  re-use the same pad for 30 days (dead skin cells and all). The directions instruct you to place the pad on the plastic insert after each use. Mine happen to have fallen out of my hand onto the hard wood floor after a few uses and it completely disgusted me as any dust etc. from the floor stuck to the pad.</li>
    <li> I love these pads. They are very effective for  eliminating chest wrinkles. I recently tried it on my neck and it works very well. The only downside is that they don&#x27;t last as long as I &#x27;d like for the price.</li>
    <li> These pads work for the chest/decollette area quite well. I have noticed a huge difference since I started wearing them to bed at night. I use alcohol to wipe the area before I put them on. They on stay on well all night and I don&#x27;t notice them when I&#x27;m sleeping. My only gripe is how much they cost and how long they last. I can usually get about 2 1/2 to 3 weeks top with them. After they stop adhering I will rinse them with mild soap, let them dry, and then they last a couple more days. I have never had them last more than a few days after cleaning them. I will continue to use them because they work so well but if I were on a tighter budget I just wouldn&#x27;t be able to afford them. It would be nice if you got more pads per order or if they would last longer. Oh and...I used the face pads without any success. Wrinkles were still there in the morning if the things even stayed on throughout the night which they don&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t think they are a good solution for facial wrinkles. I find frownies work better on that area.</li>
    <li> Theoretically this does work. But it makes me sweat so much in the area where it is, I can&#x27;t really leave it on. Didn&#x27;t end up using it.</li>
    <li> wonderful product, no chest wrinkles, I will always use and have told all my friends</li>
    <li> works really well for about 2 weeks.  I would continue to use it but the pricing is high for that length of time.</li>
    <li> Totally sceptical... But very happy With the results. I made by the neck one as well. I have had the issues with my  chest from a severe Sunburn in my younger years and it literally is gone in the morning. It does return but I have only been using it for a few weeks now but the difference is incredible. If I&#x27;m going out I&#x27;ll put it on for an hour or so as well before hand. I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> I consulted a plastic surgeon about my chest wrinkles, perhaps seeking a filler of sorts, and he said he could not help me with this issue, that fillers did not really work here.  There are a couple of different products to choose from when you do your internet search.  I am so happy I started with this product, after seeing the positive reviews, and won&#x27;t be looking at alternatives.   It seems it would be a stretch to actually get 60 days of wear out of one pad, I have gotten 30 days out of my first so far, and it will surprise me if it is still wearable for 30 more days.  I hope I am pleasantly surprised.  Yes, it gets a little gunky, despite all the pre-cleaning of your chest, and periodically washing the pad.  I wish it was more affordable for a wider range of women to have access to these benefits.  Price is the only reason for the four stars.  This product works!  I wish I could find something like this for facial wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Strange concept, but it works. Nice smooth chest skin.</li>
    <li> UPDATE:  My original review was very positive, but this product has changed.  One pad used to last 4 - 5 weeks, but lately (the last two I purchased) lasted less than a week.  They lose their adhesive after one or two nights.  I&#x27;ve purchased DOZENS of these pads, at considerable expense, but will be looking for something else. Unfortunate bait and switch.  You have lost a loyal customer.</li>
    <li> I wish I knew about this sooner.  This is perfect for side sleepers to prevent and soften current chest wrinkles.  I won&#x27;t go to sleep without it.</li>
    <li> I get how these work , they prevent the skin from moving and bunching, makes sense. I don&#x27;t buy the claim that they reduce the lines already there, but the prevention overnight of letting your skin slip back into those wrinkles, and deepen them,  is good enough for me. I find it to work remarkably well, I wish it would last longer. I was hoping to stretch it beyond the 30 day suggested replacement, no such luck, even if you wash it well, it just loses its &amp;#34;stick.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Bellini to save some money, bad idea. In fairness, I don&#x27;t believe the Bellni bill themselves to be worn overnight, the Silc Skin do. The Bellni&#x27;s don&#x27;t stick well and end up falling off or bunching up, I will stick with the more expensive Silc Skin.</li>
    <li> You will keep you decollette looking smooth and wrinkle free if you wear this every night while you sleep. The Chest-a-peel is better, but apparently is no longer available in the US . . . thank you FDA!</li>
    <li> This is a great purchase.  I will buy it for life! Don&#x27;t hesitate any longer. There are no creams that match what this product can do.</li>
    <li> This particular brand is far inferior to the Calvet Décolleté Pads which are tapered at the edges allowing clothing and bedding to ride smoothly over them without lifting. The SilcSkin brand has a blunt cut edge like a cookie cutter which gets caught up in anything that comes in contact with it. Bedding and clothing tend to push and lift the edges causing lint and pet hair to get imbedded in it making impossible to clean. As a result they don&#x27;t last as long as the Calvet brand. My own hair often gets caught under it as well which is uncomfortable when trying to sleep. I would prefer to have the choice of brands. For $28.00 I&#x27;d just as soon go to another site to purchase them.  Goatlady here with an update. Sadly, it turns out that the SilcSkin is the \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; version also made by Calvet. However I do have some suggestions as to how to extend the life of these pads. When the edges become so embedded with lint that they no longer stick, simply trim the edges off. Also purchase a roll of medical silicone tape to tack down the edges at the corners to allow clothing to smoothly ride over it. The tape can be reused a few times. The subscription plan is also a great savings. Each new pad I get seems to be of inferior quality to the previous ones. I hope this trend doesn&#x27;t continue. The most recent pad actually leaves chunks of the adhesive on the storage tray.</li>
    <li> Great idea just don&#x27;t like how quickly the adhesive goes away</li>
    <li> I bought this as a lark, I never imagined that it would actually be effective! I started noticing lines on my d&amp;eacute;colletage that I knew was from age, but I was surprised since I&#x27;ve been using sunblock for 30 plus years, I don&#x27;t sunbathe or expose my skin to the sun without sunblock, so why was I getting these lines? I use skin creams religiously too, and nothing was making a difference in these lines. I put this on one night and by the morning my lines were barely visible! I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I used it for several weeks and the lines are pretty much gone. The cons: the adhesion wears away quickly, it had not been a full month before the edges were rolling up; I like to apply moisturize on my chest at night and cannot apply any lotion before putting this on; I occasionally sleep on my side and I could not while wearing this thing. I only bought one, and haven&#x27;t gotten another yet, but I&#x27;m sure once I see the lines return I&#x27;ll be re-purchasing.</li>
    <li> Not only does this product stop wrinkles from forming but it&#x27;s helping the existing wrinkles go away. I have recommended to so many of my friends.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I read the reviews and was a little  apprehensive but thought what&#x27;s $30 to lose if it doesn&#x27;t work out. Well it was amazing!!!  My chest was so smooth and it usually is full of deep creases from me being a side sleeper and having large breasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a review where the woman used a backwards sports bra and thought I would try that. Well that was funny looking but the straps held my breast apart and the silicone pad in place, so it will last longer than the month!!!  I want to try the ones for under the eyes next!!!  You must try this product because you will love it!!</li>
    <li> Works great, but does not last not even 30 days, much less 60. The other problem is the price. Hope this product goes down in cost.</li>
    <li> amazing product,mis wrinkes se fueron ,maravillosose lo recomiendo,solo dura muy poco tiempo.facil de usar y manejable,no molesta al domir suave</li>
    <li> The pads didn&#x27;t stick at all, even after following the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions to a T.  Consistently using a scrub and good moisturizer will be much more effective...</li>
    <li> This product really does work! I am a side sleeper and starting to get chest wrinkles. To make it stay in place at night, grab a t-shirt or rolled up towel, wear some kind of a tank top or tighter fitting top to bed to help keep it in place and put the rolled up towel or tshirt between your breasts after you put the pad on and it helps keep the pad in place all night so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it! I have used rubbing alcohol to clean mine. I spray it on a let it sit for a while and then I rinse off in really hot water and that seems to help keep the stickiness way longer. Plus I don&#x27;t use a lotion or anything at night. I put that on in the morning so that it doesn&#x27;t make the stickiness go away. I make sure to wash my chest before and put it on after it&#x27;s dry. And that seems to help it stick really well.. I only gave it 4 stars because I think it&#x27;s pricey for a tiny pad but definitely works!! and for those who say it&#x27;s too big, just cut it to a size that works for you!</li>
    <li> It works but it is a bit weird to sleep with it on.  I was able to use it for 4-5 weeks until it started losing its adhesive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a side sleeper and stomach sleeper and large breasted so I suffer from deep wrinkles on my chest. I feel like I&#x27;m way to young to have these wrinkles!! Anyway, I tried this product and it really works. After a few times wearing it my wrinkles were completely gone. You have to keep using it though or the wrinkles come right back. I&#x27;m now ordering my 2nd one as I&#x27;ve worn out the stickiness on the first one. I tried to wash it with mild soap but it didn&#x27;t retain it&#x27;s original stick. So it&#x27;s time to invest in a new one and I&#x27;m happy to do so.</li>
    <li> I really like these pads work like they say.</li>
    <li> I had a very bad reaction to this SilcSkin Pad where I experienced an immediate strong aching &amp; pressure in my jaws. The symptom disappeared upon its instant removal. I have been afraid of using it since.  I could not remember where I had purchased it from until I received an email recently from the company More Quality Less Money requesting a product review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchasers should be given a strict WARNING on the side effects and perhaps even the safety of this product.</li>
    <li> There are very few beauty products that actually work. This is one of them. It is nothing short of a miracle for a wrinkle free decollete!!</li>
    <li> The best way to use the pads, for me.  I do not unpeel them.  I wear a sports bra backwards, I place the pad (the thick side) on the chest and let the sports bra hold it up.  I do not sleep with it.  When I get up in the morning or when I am getting ready I will wear the pad with my sports bra.  I will put the pad in the freezer until the next use.  Hope this helps out and save you money in the long run.</li>
    <li> D.pads are better than D.cream. I would be most likely to order again.Thank you I gave a product name is &amp;#34;Hope in the D.pads:)&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> With this pad, I&#x27;m not concerned about sleeping on my side. When I wake up in the morning and remove the chest I see no wrinkles. My chest is a smooth as can be.</li>
    <li> they were okay. it works but its really gross to look at after using it for a few nights and i would wash it but it still didnt seem to clean off very well. looking for another alternative.</li>
    <li> These are the best I could not live with out them and they really work.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about how effective and long lasting the results from using this product would be.  I was pleasantly surprised that it smoothed the skin and the results lasted about two days.  You have to keep your skin and the pad clean and dry so that it will adhere.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I was a bit skeptical when I researched and found this product, but after reading the reviews I decided to pay the $25 and give it a try.  I have noticed that there are some wrinkles forming on my chest and cleavage area.  I am a side sleeper and hug myself when I sleep and I guess with age the wrinkles have decided to take over various parts of my body!  I ordered and received this product from Amazon and followed the instructions on application.  Yes, it is a big sticker that you have to peel off the sticker-holder-thing and apply to the lower neck/cleavage area.  It was a different feeling having a sticker stuck to my chest while I slept, but I&#x27;m happy to say that just after a week I can see a difference!  It did leave my fair skin a little red after I removed it in the morning, but I like the fact that you can re-use it.  I would highly recommend this product to those who have or are dealing with chest wrinkles as it is a great alternative to those expensive creams that don&#x27;t do much!  Happy wrinkle stickering!</li>
    <li> I have used this product everynight for the past two months. It is just starting to loose the stickyness BUT this is an AMAZING product!! Well worth the price. You will want to save the plastic sleeve so you can put the pad back on it until you use it again. You can also wash the pad with mild soap as it does get ucky. Apply to clean skin so don&#x27;t use any creams prior to applying.  I was a bit weary about how this product would work but I am so happy I&#x27;ve purchased it. It does the trick. I no longer wake up with the creases in my chest. Being a side sleeper for years and a 38D, I&#x27;ve developed the chest winkles over the years. It doesn&#x27;t bother me when I sleep and it stays in place until I peel it off in the am. I did have a light reddish area but after 10 mins or so the redness goes away.  If you are questionable about getting this product, as I was... it really really does work. Get it and you too will be very pleased!</li>
    <li> This pad does EXACTLY what is says it will do.  Wear it every night and I awake to virtually NO chest wrinkles from lying on my side! It is incredible and I wouldn&#x27;t be with out it!  Have tried the other heart shaped pillow pad and this is MUCH better! It is thinner and softer and way more comfortable to wear. It easily conforms to your body and your movements. Don&#x27;t even notice it! It is CLEAR and thus less obnoxious looking! The size is more practical for the chest area.  The heart pillow would creep up to my chin! The adhesive lasts much longer than the heart pillow.  I have used the same one for 5 mos. now, keeping it clean as instructions state AND always making sure my chest area is clean, toned and dry.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> Excellent! My wife love it.</li>
    <li> This brand works as I had hoped.  Be sure to always place the pad on a clean surface when not in use.  Using any kind of lotion on your chest within hours of using the pad may well shorten the life of the pad by reducing the adhesiveness.</li>
    <li> short durability, lasted very little</li>
    <li> It really does what it says, which I found hard to believe at first! I&#x27;m am really surprised of the result... my chest wrinkle are almost all gone when I weak up in the morning... The only thing is that the pad doesn&#x27;t lenght one month as it says... It starts degrading after 2 weeks and then doesn&#x27;t stick so well...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these pads the past year and LOVE them!  I wish I didn&#x27;t have to replacement them periodically, but it&#x27;s well worth it considering I can wear a V-neck blouse without feeling self-conscious.  I am a HUGE fan!</li>
    <li> I ordered my second pad and so far I have been pleased with the results.  It is a good temporary fix.</li>
    <li> Have tried others, but this is the best. will never buy a different brand again! I learned my lesson!</li>
    <li> It feels weird and doesn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
    <li> I love this Decollette Pad. It really does take away the chest lines that come from sleeping on my side. I&#x27;m only giving it a 4 because it lasts 3 weeks. If it lasted a month I&#x27;d give it 5 stars and i even longer would be 5 plus, even if that&#x27;s not possible on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Works temporarily when used every night . I was a little hard to stay on in these certain areas.&lt;br /&gt;If you want temporary relief for a night out or something they are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna T.</li>
    <li> It kept falling off! Then when I actually got it to stay it would crinkle up! It was annoying. ugh</li>
    <li> The pad really helps with less chest wrinkles in the morning, but it feels a little uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> I get this item delivered monthly.  It truly does work.  I use it more in the summer when I had sleeveless tops on, but if  know I&#x27;m wearing something over the weekend, I&#x27;ll start wearing it about 4 days before. It really smooths out your chest.  It is also very comfortable to sleep in.</li>
    <li> I have large &#x27;girls&#x27; and while I like them well enough, they have certainly left me with deep wrinkles on my chest from sleeping on my side.  I started using these pads about a year ago and they really help.  Your skin has to be absolutely clean and dry before applying and I always lay down to apply so everything is flat.  Just mush it onto your chest and it will pretty much stay in place through the night although I have to say when I&#x27;m having a sweaty night it can come loose.  Then next morning I wash it with a bit of warm water and a little bit of hand soap and lay out to dry for about an hour.  When dry you just place it sticky side down back on it&#x27;s plastic wrap and it&#x27;s ready for the next night.  If you take good care of it it will certainly last a month and sometimes longer but make sure you don&#x27;t get any oil or hair on it.  Your skin looks much more &#x27;plumped&#x27; in the morning and I then apply a chest cream (currently using Dr Prcms) and SUNBLOCK, don&#x27;t forget your SUNBLOCK on your chest girls!!  Where does the sun hit us when we&#x27;re driving???</li>
    <li> This is amazing stuff and a miracle worker! I was a little apprehensive to be honest but after one night with this I am so happy I bought this little gem! Truly it does remove any wrinkles and has made me so much confident now, I will definitely be using this often and highly highly recommend this..</li>
    <li> Ladies I am telling you this product WORKS. The first night I used it 90% of my wrinkles were gone , the deep ones took a few more days. It&#x27;s over a week now and I can&#x27;t believe they are ALL GONE. I am 45 and I look very young in the face but my chest told a different story, it looked just plain old. I hate high collared shirts but I was getting to a point where I was embarrassed to wear a v-neck. I tried damn near every cream out there and nothing worked, I was actively looking into getting injections to plump the skin up. I came across this product and I though well this will be the last product I will try before injections, Sooooo glad I did. The only tips I have for you is this, wear a regular collared t-shirt to bed, it will keep it from sticking to your sheets and pulling off. Wash it once a week with mild soap and let air dry, it will get kinda gross looking from dead skin and fuzz etc.Keep the film you pull off when you first open it and the bag it comes in, put the film back on every morning and place back into the bag so it stays cleaner. And lastly you will have to wear this EVERY night if you are a cronic side sleeper. I forgot to wear it one night (passed out) and the wrinkles were back just not as deep as before I started it, but you could see them non the less. Bottom line is this thing works and I wish I would of thought of it first.</li>
    <li> This actually does work when you use it!</li>
    <li> Just got this two days ago and the first night, I was nervous that it would come off or I would pull it off, but I didn&#x27;t. I woke up the next morning and there were no lines..... I mean if I looked closely I could see the lines that had been forming but it look 80% better. I was amazed to say the least. I used it the second night and slept great. Woke up starting to see smoother skin still.... WOW... Now I did use an astringent (twice) before applying because I want it it last the 30 to 60 days (I am hoping for the 60 days). If all goes well I will be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I started getting chest wrinkles over past few months from sleeping on my side and every morning I would notice it getting worse. So I found this product on Amazon and read the reviews and thought it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try it. The first night I slept with it I got great results. It kept me from getting all wrinkly on my chest and It did seem to have smoothed out the old wrinkles. I will definitely be using this from now on to keep from getting those unsightly chest wrinkles. I&#x27;m 41 years old and not ready for that. I hope they keep making these Decollette pads.</li>
    <li> I am large chested and love to sleep on my side.  Wore while sleeping.  Woke with no chest wrinkles.  My skin looked better than it has in years.</li>
    <li> On 2nd night and they do NOT stay on. I had one of these 5 years ago and loved it! Not sure what has changed (other than the price), but do NOT buy...a wast of $30. I do like the tray that they added.</li>
    <li> This was not the same quality as the first pad I received and will not last as long....</li>
    <li> I really like this but the bad part is it last only about 8 or 9 days and that&#x27;s it!</li>
    <li> Like most of the reviewers say, this pad is the most effiecient way to get rid off and keep off vertical wrinkles on your chest. What I do to make it last longer and also keep the pad in place thru the night: I put on this pad, then T-shirt, then [[ASIN:B005EUH1A8 Intimia Breast Pillow - Chest Wrinkles Prevention and Breast Support]]. I am 50 years old, 38D -  those vertical wrinkles just started to appear, now they are gone and looks like I can keep them gone this way for a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading the rave reviews, and I&#x27;d have to say, it totally delivered.  I sleep on my side, and sometime in my mid 50&#x27;s I started to have long, light wrinkles down my chest.  I think I am lucky it took so long, because my husband and I are beach lovers, but until then my chest was wrinkle and freckle free, and I got used to it that way!  I thought I was just going to have to get used to the wrinkles, and told myself I was lucky that at my age (60) they were so light and not that noticable, and I still had no freckles or age spots.  Well, ONE night with the pad and my chest looked great, totally wrinkle free.  I had to use my magnifying mirror to find just faint traces of them, and even those were gone after a few more nights!  The down side...  I thought it was something I could just use before special events or times my chest would be showing for sure - more in the summer etc.  I thought I wouldn&#x27;t mind having my chest wrinkles most of the time, because spending $30 a month or so is a lot of money to keep them away!  So after a couple of weeks, I slept without it one night... and they completely came back!!  I expected it I guess, but I didn&#x27;t expect to hate it so much.  I might not be able to afford to use this all the time, or even half of the time, and now that I don&#x27;t have tolerance for those chest wrinkles anymore, it&#x27;s made it harder to accept.  In the meantime, I will be using this as often as I can afford!</li>
    <li> This product worked after the first time I used it.  I would like to continue using them but it could become expensive...I&#x27;ll think about it.  So easy to use</li>
    <li> easy to use and works great!  I have ordered another for myself and one for my mother.  I don&#x27;t remember to use it every day so it lasted me a couple months</li>
    <li> I have been using these for several years and an absolutely addicted, especially in the summer time. I used to try to hide my chest area due to chest wrinkles that really aged me, but now I wear whatever I want and look 20 years younger. In order to keep my chest wrinkle free, I need to sleep with one of these on nightly. It is comfortable and I forget that I have it on. If I go a week without using it, I notice my wrinkles creeping back up so on it goes again. I have to order one at least every 6 months, because they do wear out. Love, love, love this product!</li>
    <li> I have been buying these pads for over a year now and they work. I have noticed over the last two months that the quality has gone down. They do not last 30 days. You will be lucky to get 2 weeks out of the pad. I clean and care for it just as directed but for reason the pads no longer stay sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would continue to buy if the product lasted longer. It&#x27;s way too expensive to only last a few short days. I will keep one and use it the night before I have a special occasion. Bring back the good quality! I feel like we&#x27;re getting ripped off!</li>
    <li> I am 40 and was just beginning to develop chest wrinkles due to being a side sleeper.  I absolutely LOVE this product.  It is expensive, yes...and I don&#x27;t use it everyday, but it works so well!!  I am just about to re-order a 2nd one after using the 1st one for 3 months.</li>
    <li> Great concept for preventing chest wrinkles.  The adhesive made my skin break out and itch.  I would not recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin</li>
    <li> If my co-workers ask... &amp;#34;I know nothing&amp;#34;, like Sargent Schultz on Hogan&#x27;s Heroes. It worked so well after just one night, that I kept feeling my decollatage throughout the day almost in disbelief. No wrinkles any longer! I&#x27;ve just ordered 2 more, no way will I do without now that I know how well it works.</li>
    <li> Previously ordered this and was so thrilled I ordered another because I know they only last so long.  Unfortunately this purchase was not as good.  It did not adhere like the first one and therefore slips out of position while sleeping.  I went back to my original because even though its past its prime, it still stays on better than the new one.  I recently reordered from another source so hopefully I will happy with it.</li>
    <li> works great!!!! BUT only for about 3 weeks. after 3 weeks it began to give me  a rash (after wearing),  it started to smell and began to itch.  because of it&#x27;s stickiness it collects hair and dust and that is why i think it started to give me a rash. even after washing it you have to lay it sticky side up (as it dries) so it still collects dust. so after a while it will stop sticking to your skin and that is why i think it started to itch because some of it was sticking and some of it wasn&#x27;t. it also started to smell. but for the first 2 solid weeks of it being new it worked great with no rash, no itching or smelling and no wrinkles. i just can not afford to buy this every 2 weeks. thinking of just trying some painters tape to tape on my chest every night.</li>
    <li> Sometimes the adhesive is on the top and sometimes it&#x27;s on the bottom and there is no way to tell ahead of time.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have purchased in a long time, it REALLY help with over night wrinkles, definitely worth the price. thank you whoever invented this</li>
    <li> I have tried so many things to get rid of my chest wrinkles. Expensive IPL treatments, creams that cost a fortune (the Aldi Lacura Chest &amp; Neck cream is very good BTW) but nothing had the effect of these chest pads. They are AMAZING!! I really wish for the price that they came in packs of 2 as I have to wear each night as the skin on my chest is very thin and I don&#x27;t get a full month out of them (yes, I clean but still not a full month). I even tried a nightbra (see nightbra.com) and although it stopped my breasts from crushing to my chest completely it still did not &#x27;iron out&#x27; the wrinkles this this fabulous product does.  FYI I am a 34D/DD(IE 12D/DD) and I don&#x27;t find that the weight of my boobs throws them out at all. Couldn&#x27;t say for the bigger busted girls how they would go but it would certainly be better than nothing. Absolutely fabulous product. Hopefully one day they will come down in price or come in packs of 2. I actually sell bra&#x27;s for a living (in Australia) and I mention them to any women with chest wrinkles!  Would have given 5 stars but a little exy. Other than that they are wonderful. Love them!! Thank you to the woman that createe them xxxx</li>
    <li> Product is not as described, after 3 days of use the pad doesnt stick and its itchy. Waste of money!! Was delivered late too.</li>
    <li> I love it but if you get hot and sweaty at night this is not for you, it will slide off and pick up lint from the sheets or your pj&#x27;s and it will lose its&#x27; stickiness. The product does do what it is supposed to do. I have no more creases above my cleavage.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot. It does works to smooth out my lines on my chest (not totally though). I was using a  few times a week but it gets a little gross and you can&#x27;t really clean it. So now I use it when I know I&#x27;ll be wearing something that is low cut. I would love to use it daily but too expensive to buy more then 1 at a time.</li>
    <li> I thought this was too good to be true, even after seeing so many positive reviews.  I noticed a HUGE difference in how the skin on my décolleté looked after the first morning... not as many spots, much less noticeable &amp;#34;V&amp;#34; shaped line between my breasts.  I ordered this to try about a week before a Christmas Party where I wanted to wear a low necked gown and after just a few days, my chest area looked much younger, fresh, wrinkle free and youthful.  I wore it a couple of hours before I dressed for the party too since it seemed like over the course of the day the effect wasn&#x27;t as profound as when I first woke up.  I am thinking I will save these for a week or 2 before special events where I want to wear clothes that show this part of my skin since they really only last about a few weeks before losing their &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; effectiveness.  I&#x27;m really glad I found this youth reviving secret!</li>
    <li> Impossible to be comfortable in this thing while lying on your side and if you don&#x27;t sleep on your side, you don&#x27;t need it.  I admit the one night a made it through, there were no evident lines in my chest.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid twenties, so I don&#x27;t have a terrible problem yet with lines or wrinkles. I do, however, have huge breasts, and regardless of my age they definitely cause some strain on the skin on my chest. I bought this so I could  smooth out the stress lines before I slipped into a bikini, and I was pleasantly surprised with the results. My skin was pristine and unlined after a mere twenty five minutes of wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak for mature and aged skin, but for a quick touch up I treat this product like you would a brightening face mask. Quick on, quick off, good results.</li>
    <li> Tried it as soon as I got it, stuck it on the first night I received it. I slept fine despite my worry that it would be uncomfortable, which it wasn&#x27;t, woke up, peeled it off, looked in the mirror, and holy mother of God, the wrinkles were gone!!!!  I am a 45 year old woman, 36B, so I didn&#x27;t have a lot on top, but I sleep curled up like a baby hedgehog and was starting to see these annoying lines.  Saw this advertised, and although it is pricey for a 30-60 day life-span, let me tell you it&#x27;s worth the money.  I think about how much I spend on creams and serums, and they never touched these lines, this pad erases them.  Now I know when I look at the stars on the red carpet and they are smooth and line free, this must be their secret.  BUY THIS!!!</li>
    <li> I truly wished I made this purchase long ago. I have tried everything and this works and really fast. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Lines are less visible.  I am happy with the results.  I wish it last longer.  Overall great product!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> like everyone else has said, this really works. A lot of people complain about the low shelf life of the adhesive, what has worked for me is to NOT put it on the sheet provided because that is just one more time sticking and ripping meaning 30 times a month is closer to 60 times. When I am done I place it adhesive side up on a plate and a small bowl over it to keep anything off of it... month two and still going strong!</li>
    <li> I find this product does help the appearance of my chest wrinkles. They prevent them from deepening but does not eliminate them completely. Sometimes my chest gets itchy with brand new ones. But it goes away. I find it comfortable otherwise. My only real complaint is its expensive considering it does not last that long. For me it lasts about 1 month and I follow all manufacturer recommendations.</li>
    <li> It definately works for it&#x27;s intended purpose but I have sensitive skin and I start itching about halfway through the night and have to remove it to get back to sleep. I don&#x27;t get a rash, just itchy. Some bras create an itching problem for me so I think I may be in the minority of users who encounter a problem with the Decolletter Pad. Very fast shipping from this company!</li>
    <li> worked great for five days and it lost all adhesiveness, really not happy about spending $28.00 on a product that didn&#x27;t even last!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to sleep on side with the pad .Wont buy it again</li>
    <li> This thing really works.  I try to sleep on my back but invariably wind up on my side causing ugly wrinkles.  I will order a new one when this one wears out.</li>
    <li> Been using these for three weeks along with a vitamin C oil on my chest, already seeing a vast improvement.</li>
    <li> This pad is comfortable.  I&#x27;m 43 and see a lot of wrinkles forming on my chest area, and I wanted something with results.  Most of the wrinkles occur when I sleep on my side, and compress that area.  I tried this based on reviews, and I really liked it.  It did what it said.. it kept that area from squishing together and making &amp;#34;wrinkles&amp;#34;.  The problem is, it&#x27;s a little gross.  After a few uses, the gummy backing (which does not transfer to your skin) gets yucky.  It balls up, gets discolored, and starts to peel from the edges.  It suggests you rinse it off, and I have.  It&#x27;s supposed to be DISPOSABLE and you need to replace it after a few uses.  This seems like a complete EXPENSIVE waste.  I just bought some &amp;#34;skin adhesive&amp;#34;... the type girls use to keep their skimpy dresses in place, or whatever else you need to stay put.  It worked.  I have a &amp;#34;roll on&amp;#34; kind, and i rolled it onto my chest, adhered this pad, and it stuck.  The skin adhesive is water soluble and doesn&#x27;t cause problems. I hope it continues to work.</li>
    <li> These really do work!  Not only did they get rid of the lines that were already there, but worn nightly they do not come back.  I wear one every night when I go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are a bit expensive....</li>
    <li> These are amazing!  I can&#x27;t tell that they give long lasting results after use, but I will say that I notice a major difference each morning after wearing it to bed.  Skin looks more supple.  I&#x27;m a side sleeper and use these to improve appearance of cleavage wrinkles.  Also, I was able to stretch my use longer than a month.  Just wash with baby shampoo occasionally.</li>
    <li> This really works!  Love it.</li>
    <li> I want to buy stock in this company.  These work so well.  I need to buy a whole case next time.</li>
    <li> These things are awesome!</li>
    <li> I have bought and used this product for over a year and a half! Best if you buy monthly as they start to not stick as well! But this works I swear by them!!! wrinkles disappear!!!! Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I really wasn&#x27;t sure about this but thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I really works!  If you stop using it, it goes back to the way it was.  Even my husband was surprised by the results.  I used it nightly for the first 10-14 days.  Then I use it a few times a week now. If I&#x27;m going to wear something lowcut I can use it the night before and it makes a real difference!</li>
    <li> I found this product while reading a review for another product (I don&#x27;t even remember what it was).  I decided to give the SilcSkin Decollette Pad a try after I read the reviews here on Amazon.  I spent a lot of time in the sun as a teen and seemed to burn my chest over and over.  Between the damaged skin and being a side sleeper, I have deep lines in my chest.  I find myself trying to sleep on my back and applying lot&#x27;s of moisturizer before a big event where I will need to wear something with a neckline - to no avail. Cue the statement necklace!&lt;br /&gt;I put this product on last night and slept in it comfortably - even on my side.  This morning when I took it off - the lines are GONE!!  I wish I would have taken a before and after picture!!  I am thrilled!!&lt;br /&gt;I hope that the sticky side will last for 30 - 60 like it says - because I am SOLD on this product.  I&#x27;ll see how long the sticky side lasts for me and will update my review.  But based on my first impression, I say:  \\&quot;Try it! You&#x27;ll like it!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This is amazing. I&#x27;ve only used twice, but after the first time I saw results. I wake up every morning with lines on my décolleté, and they were getting worse and lasting longer throughout the day. From the very first night I used this, I woke up took it off and NO LINES! My décolleté was smooth, I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I&#x27;m sold.  9/11/2015 - revised review. I still think the product works really well, however after using it I found that it did not last nearly as long as it states on the package. I cleaned the area I applied it to as directed as well as cleaning the pad itself as directed. After about 2 weeks I noticed even though the pad stuck in place, it was much less effective. I kept wearing it to 25 days and my lines were back - so yes, does it &amp;#34;last&amp;#34; 20-30 days, but it only does what it&#x27;s supposed to for about two weeks. Very disappointed as this is pretty expensive item for once a month, but since it only works about 1/2 of that it becomes twice as much. Why are these so pricey anyway? I will be looking for something else as the price is too much for how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> Jumping around like a total whakadoo, it works!!!!! First time use, astutely amazed.  Will try to remember to come back and add info on durability, etc.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I wash mine occasionally with woolite.  It is still wearable 4 months later.  Will eed a new one soon.  I will definitely buy another.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical while reading about this product but I also read a lot of positive reviews. I figured I&#x27;d buy and just return it if it did not work.  Well, I tried it for less than an hour (it&#x27;s recommended at least 1 or 2 hours) and even then, I did see a difference. The next time I tried it, I left it on longer and it worked even better. After years of abusing my body in the sun, my chest is a mess (thankfully not my face lol). I am probably only going to use it for when I have a night out because using it every single day could get pricey. It works GREAT. Highly recommend. My husband thought I was nutty for buying it and he was even impressed when he saw the difference. Much cheaper than plastic surgery :)</li>
    <li> AFTER 2 WEEKS USING IT, DOES NOT WANT TO STICKY ANYMORE. I KEPT SKIN CLEAN AS PER INSTRUCTIONS AND ALSO WASHED PAD AS INSTRUCTIONS.</li>
    <li> Love the results of this product.  I am super excited to not see the deep creases every morning as I brush my teeth.  Wish it came in multiples and were a little less expensive, but am thrilled about the results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this, but ended up being disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many ladies, I was starting to notice those dreaded lines in the decollette area and was somewhat horrified. These &amp;#34;wrinkles&amp;#34; (UGH!) are very prominent in the morning, so it became clear to me that I was causing them by sleeping on my side. I had tried training myself to sleep on my back to no avail. So, after researching available products to help this problem, I came across the SilcSkin Decollette Pad. You wear it while sleeping, thus preventing your chest from wrinkling during the night. Reviews indicated that it worked for side-sleepers. The concept seemed legit, so I purchased it. I used the product as instructed for three nights in a row. Every night, the same thing happened. It slipped off while I was asleep. On my side. Every. Single. Night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t fully understand why it works for others that are side-sleepers and not for me. I followed the directions precisely. I&#x27;m not some sort of freak in the anatomical sense, so I&#x27;m not sure what gives. I will say that I do think the pad may be a bit too thick, which may or may not be why it didn&#x27;t work. Perhaps a thinner pad would adhere better for a side-sleeper? I don&#x27;t know. All I know is that I wasted my $ on a sticky piece of silicone that does nothing for me.</li>
    <li> As a fifty-something woman, I would not live without these. I put mine on a few hours before I get up, and wake up with a nice, smooth decollette (the area between your neck and cleavage). Bet my mom would&#x27;ve loved these...  If you wash your neck with a little soap before you go to bed, this will last for at least two months.</li>
    <li> This does what it states and provides a wrinkle free decollage. Yeah!  Wearing it during the day is comfortable. I began wearing at night but found it uncomfortable. However I liked the clear skin in the morning.</li>
    <li> Everyone who is concerned with decollate wrinkles should own one of these pads, i sleep with it on every night and it has made a huge difference to the lines in this area.  This pad does exactly as stated!  Fast delivery and good communication from seller.</li>
    <li> I was a bit unsure because I used another before and loved it, however, it seems they went out of business and since I&#x27;m a side sleeper, I needed something else because I was noticing the fine lines coming back, I have very minimal, fine lines and want to keep it that way or gone... this product was great. I was very pleased with how thin it was, it wasn&#x27;t obvious that you were wearing it and really, it&#x27;s comfortable. It also does what it says, the minimal fine lines I have disappeared. I will definitely use again!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for one month and I love it.  I read the  reviews before I purchased the Decollette Pad with skepticism and I was pleasantly surprised.  I wish they lasted longer or that the pricing was less to make them more affordable to use continuously.</li>
    <li> Love it. Started having wrinkles that took forever to go away during my pregnancy from sleeping on my side, never normally do that nor will I after. Very happy with the results. The product is pricey and should come in sets as mentioned by other reviewers. After a few uses it&#x27;s a little icky and lost the full adhesiveness. However it&#x27;s worth the money for results and botox/chemicals can&#x27;t be used for 9 months.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it for very long but it stays in place and seems to be keeping the wrinkles away.  My skin seems a little red when I take it off.</li>
    <li> It really works!  It keeps your chest from looking wrinkled.</li>
    <li> It works but you will have to buy a new one every two weeks. Cheaper then a spa or injections.</li>
    <li> These are amazing - can&#x27;t live without them now.  When you use them properly - they will definitely last at least a month.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the first one I ordered!!  Lost its stickiness quick!  I feel like I lost my money!</li>
    <li> When I remember use this item it works great. A little uncomfortable at first but it cleans up well and lasts for about 5-10 uses.</li>
    <li> This is totally awesome....I was skeptical in how well it would work, but the next morning after wearing the Decollette Pad I was astonished at how the wrinkles had disappeared.  I&#x27;m a cuddley side sleeper.  I love love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 54 years old and had creases/wrinkles on my chest since I was 40.  I started using these silicone decolette pads for about 5 years.  They work!  Got rid of the creases on my chest in about 5 days.  will never go without them.</li>
    <li> The product works.... for about 2 weeks when the adhesive stops doing its job. I would recommend it if it came with an adhesive paste that you could apply to it.</li>
    <li> They work very well! I have used them before for many years! And they last a long time! Yippee! Yeah!</li>
    <li> This thing is great.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a product like this, and it actually works!  The nights I forget to wear it I can see wrinkles on my upper chest again.  The nights I wear it, my upper chest is smooth and wrinkle-free.  I highly recommend this to anyone who has deep upper chest wrinkles from sleeping on their side or stomach.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it works long term but I can see a difference when I take it off in the morning and it feels ok to sleep with!</li>
    <li> I usually put my on in the morning while I&#x27;m getting ready to go.  It corrects those nighttime creases that I have on nights I sleep on my side.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I sleep on my side and I was starting to get a crease on my décolletage.  I tried putting rolled up socks between my boobs, but that didn&#x27;t help.  I don&#x27;t know if this actually &amp;#34;heals&amp;#34; any damage, but it is stiff enough that it prevents my chest from creasing when I sleep.  I&#x27;ve been using it every night for maybe three weeks, and it is still working.  It collects lint and hair and whatnot, but if you wash it with plain soap and water it comes sort of clean.  I hope it lasts a while longer, because I don&#x27;t want to replace it every month.  Update: I bought a second one but haven&#x27;t opened it yet.  The first one doesn&#x27;t stick very well anymore, but it sticks well enough to stay more or less in place if I wear a racer-back sports bra BACKWARDS over it (this is a great hack!)  So I have to say that this product is a good buy.  It&#x27;s been more than two months (with me using it every night) and it is still working.  I NEVER see creases on my chest in the mornings now.  Highly recommend.  Another update: I have been using a different pad for a few weeks because this one was unavailable for a while, but I think this one is better.  I would recommend this product to every woman.  I have always had a pretty nice décolletage because I avoid the sun, but now it is truly flawless.</li>
    <li> These work exactly as they&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
    <li> This product is great and does work, the only drawback is the price, I suggest you buy 2 and save.  Would also be nice to have a better packaging bag to store.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter. Though young, she is looking after herself preventatively &amp; has an ample bosom. She asked for this &amp; really likes it. It bothers her occasionally &amp; then she says she moves it to her neck. Whatever works for you, I suppose.</li>
    <li> This product definitely does prevent chest wrinkles caused by sleeping on your side REALLY well! However, they are expensive and do not last long. Even if you wash after every use, they loose thier sticking quality after about 2 weeks, so be prepared to buy a few at a time. They are also not \\&quot;discreet\\&quot; as the advertisement indicates. You don&#x27;t want to wear this in public becuase it is VERY obvious!. But, in all, IT WORKS!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but after reading all the positive reviews I decided to try it.....it really does work! Not sure how or why but it improves the chest area greatly. I have been using it for 5 days now so have to see how it wears. It is starting to wear on the edges. This is a short term review and will repost after 30 days.</li>
    <li> I liked it. Seemed to help</li>
    <li> I am a side sleeper and noticed a few years ago that I had deep wrinkles throughout my chest and between my breasts.  It made me feel old and tired.  I bought this Pad and no more wrinkles!  I just love it.  With every night wear it lasts about 5 weeks - which is when the sticky side loses its strength.  I wish I could buy a case of these!</li>
    <li> So happy with this product!  I used to wake up with wrinkles on my chest ( I&#x27;m a total side sleeper), not anymore!  My chest looks flawless, and I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s.  Please try these, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!  Next time I fall asleep without using it I will take a picture, and  another one on the night I remember to use it, the difference it astonishing.</li>
    <li> I see great results in just one week!  This is what I&#x27;ve done:  Exfoliate the area, apply my anti-aging moisturizer, then apply Decollette Pads.  Amazing results in such a short time!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, keeps creases at bay. I found that I became really hot while sleeping though. It comes with a plastic card to store the pad on, but it is unusually about 1cm too short, so part of the sticky pad is left hanging off the end. I recommend this product, just maybe not during the summer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 32 years old, D cup, and have noticed DEEP creases in the morning when I wake up.  They would decrease slightly throughout the day, but I noticed them when opening the car door, in my reflection.  Ugh, first, I realize I&#x27;m getting old!  I&#x27;ve tried sleeping on my back, but always roll onto my side.  It&#x27;s a habit, I can&#x27;t help it.  Overall, I have nice skin and don&#x27;t look my age.  I HAD to fix this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I googled cleavage wrinkles because I&#x27;ve seen contraptions you put between your boobs in the past.  I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the idea.  When I saw this, and all of the great reviews, I had to try it!  So far, only a couple nights and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference.  It&#x27;s a great preventative measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is that my fiance thinks it looks creepy, lol.  I told him I&#x27;m going to age about 10 years if I don&#x27;t use it, so oh well, get used to it!  Try it!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this pad and have been using it for about a week. Its the best!!!! I totally recommend it. After my breast implants I use to wake up every morning with these ugly wrinkles on my chest that make me look ten times older. there hasn&#x27;t been a morning that I wear these that I have no wrinkles. I was so close to spending hundreds of dollars on botox injected to my I am impressed with this product and everyone should try it before resorting to Botox...! I HAVE NO WRINKLES!!! I also purchased the breast pillow to use in conjunction with the pads. I feel the pillow helps out a lot in keeping the pad in place.</li>
    <li> I was just as excited about this product as I was about the Intimia Breast pillow until this product too failed.  After a short period of time&lt;br /&gt;I would wake up with this sticky pad anywhere but on my chest!  I wear it when I&#x27;m awake and just lying around but that&#x27;s the best it can do. Make sure you make return plans within alotted time period too!</li>
    <li> These pads are incredible! I&#x27;m 45 and have had those chest creases every morning for years. It never bothered me except for summer, when the world gets to see it, but even then I figured there was nothing I could do about it short of plastic surgery. I tried these pads because I was told they not just lessen the creases, they erase them, but I did not believe it could work this well. Just one night of wearing and my chest looked completely smooth. I didn&#x27;t experience any redness after wearing it all night, other than maybe the first minute after I pulled it off. When this one wears out, I&#x27;ll definitely buy another one. What a great, simple product with big results for not too much money.</li>
    <li> This pad is amazing!!! Wore it one time and my deep verticle chest wrinkles were 75% less noticable. I do not wear to sleep in as uncomfortable but do use it for one hour each morning. The cost is expensive as it only lasts about a month, you can stretch it to 6 or 7 weeks, but again the result is outstanding and well worth a try as a wrinkled chest adds years to us previous sun worshippers.</li>
    <li> This product has great potential, but falls short. After using it less than a week I found that as I would lay on my side one side would come off and peel down.  My hair would get caught in it and it was a big mess.  I followed all of the care instructions because I really wanted it to work, but it never fully stuck for me. Not worth the price! Hopefully one day they can develop one that actually sticks, maybe disposable ones.</li>
    <li> **UPDATE** 11/4/2013 If you&#x27;ll notice in my earlier review, I mentioned how the stickiness wears off on these pads.  These pads are amazing-for about 2 weeks.  My last order was on October 19 and I have to order again.  I don&#x27;t know if something changed with the product, but they barely last 2 weeks.  I will continue to order, but it is getting expensive.  I take excellent care of the pads after I take them off.  I also use a toner to take off any lotion from the morning.  To no avail.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used these pads for a couple of years now.  A few years ago, I began noticing vertical chest wrinkles.  I did a little research and found that large breasted women get these creases when they sleep on their side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really is the ONLY product that works.  I&#x27;ve tried the pillows and other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside to this product is that the stickiness wears off on the outer edges.  I get 3 weeks out of every pad.  That&#x27;s about $10 a week.  I still order them and still use them, but the quality isn&#x27;t what it was a year or so ago.  I am very careful to take good care of it and follow the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind spending $30 on something that lasts 21 days, then this is a great product for you.  I will continue to spend the money because the pad works!</li>
    <li> Bye bye creepy orange peel  look!&lt;br /&gt;I laughed when I read the reviews age 36. 42?? I&#x27;m 73 years old and girls if you think you are wrinkled now just wait!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve resigned myself to wearing only high neck chest covering clothes although I&#x27;m really a strapless kind of person.&lt;br /&gt;Somewhere along the road I purchased this product , never even opened the package. But was cleaning off my very messy desk and came across it. So what the heck I wore it last night. it did not peel, it was not uncomfortable and it didn&#x27;t hurt at all when I took it off. And this morning , I could not believe my aged bifocal  eyes so I got out the magnifying glass. And lo  and behold NOT a wrinkle in sight. Just smooth gorgeous looking skin!&lt;br /&gt;I have been emailing all my older gal pals and I quickly purchased two more packages ( should have ordered the whole darn lot). This is AMAZING, I have no idea how/why it works and quite frankly &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t give a damn&amp;#34; it just does!&lt;br /&gt;Now if only my neck above the chest looked as good  and if by midnight it goes away, well just call me Cinderella, Ill take whatever few hours I can get!</li>
    <li> The product&#x27;s effectiveness deserves 4-5 stars, let me start off with that. If you are insecure about chest wrinkles this is a great product! I never even realized how bad mine were upon first waking up (side sleeping female) until I used this and noticed the big difference. The reason I gave 2 stars is the thing gets gross and loses stickieness FAST no matter how clean you keep it or how well you store it. I know because I have purchased 3 of them in hopes that they would last longer with quality cleaning and storage, but no, they don&#x27;t. Sticky for up to 30 days my a**. Bottom line, if you don&#x27;t mind spending a fortune, these are great. But you&#x27;ll most likely need a new one every week because that&#x27;s how quickly they get gross no matter what. For $120 a month you might as well see a dermatologist or plastic surgery office and have a professional procedure done to correct chest wrinkles more permanently.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost a year.  I was just using it by iteself, and all is good for about two or three weeks, then it loses it&#x27;s silicone and starts slipping. So, I bought the breast pillow and use both. The pads last three times longer and there are absolutely NO wrinkles anywhere. I am 63 and have NO chest wrinkles. I will never be without either one.</li>
    <li> It Worked very good a little uncomfortable to wear at night but I got used to sleeping in it fairly quickly</li>
    <li> This product does work to smooth out the vertical wrinkles that can form on the chest.  I am a side-sleeper and this causes me to have accordion-like wrinkles across my chest.  Not so cute.  I can wear this product for an hour or two and it effectively smooths out the skin.  The only problems that I have found are that it will not stay in place if you begin to perspire and it must be used regularly to be most effective.  Ideally, I would sleep with the product on, but unfortunately, I tend to perspire so it does not stay in place.  I don&#x27;t always use it as consistently as I should.  It would work far better with more regular use.  I find that it can be difficult to find a good time to wear the product, which I guess is my only reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> yes, I love it...no chest wrinkles in the morning....have been using this product for years and replace it about every 6 months...wish there was something like it for the wrinkles on my arms</li>
    <li> But then...I realized that this product has some definite drawbacks.  Really, what it does the most is encourage me never to flip onto my side, because it stretches my chest skin into unnatural positions, hurts, peels and then...I&#x27;ve noticed that it&#x27;s starting to stretch the skin at the base of my neck.  Nooooo!  So, I will wear this only before a large event (a couple hours before), where I want smooth cleavage.  It does deliver that for a few hours after you take it off.  In the meantime, I&#x27;m going to crack and order the pillow.</li>
    <li> In short, I am 25 y.o. and started noticing chest wrinkles when I woke up, that was evident throughout the day. Bought the decollete pad and it&#x27;s amazing!! No more chest wrinkles! The adhesive lasted a month and a half but the $30 is totally worth it!</li>
    <li> Chest Wrinkles Miraculously (but temporarily) Disappear!  It was amazing to see smooth, young-looking skin again!&lt;br /&gt;I knew the application of this product would only be temporary, but that&#x27;s OK!  For special occasions, when choosing a scoop neck top or low vee neck, this item is WONDERFUL!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s washable with mild soap &amp; water, and the \\&quot;stickum\\&quot; seems to renew a little after washing.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a second one to use when the first is finally exhausted.&lt;br /&gt;Wish you made some for neck, too!</li>
    <li> I like this little pad a lot.  Yeah the sticky doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like, especially since I pay almost $30 for it (that&#x27;s why the 4 instead of 5 stars), but it&#x27;s definitely worth it because my chest looks so much better than before.  It lasts me about a month and a half.  Part of the reason I think it lasts so long for me is that I do sleep mostly on my back (when I&#x27;m falling asleep or if I have trouble sleeping, I spend a lot of time on my side though).  Perhaps the more one sleeps on their side, the more quickly it loses its stick because more stress is placed on it...of course, I&#x27;m just guessing at this point.  It really helps to keep it clean (use soap and water) and to make sure I have no creams on.  I have to say though, any creases are just not there in the morning when I wear this so ultimately I will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> I throw these on in the morning while I&#x27;m running around and getting ready. By the time I leave my chest and AND neck are so smooth. I love them! You just need to wash them with a mild soap when needed and the sticky will return.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Works GREAT! I have purchased many. I recently order a new one and it came with a firm plastic sheet to &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; the décolleté pad too when not in use. SOOO MUCH better then adhering it to the plastic bag that the product originally comes in. Exceptional idea! Whoever thought of it deserves a raise!</li>
    <li> This is the second pad I have bought. I am a side sleeper and when I use it I wake up with zero chest wrinkles/lines. Love it and definitely recommend to others.</li>
    <li> These are the most amazing pads ever and work so well! I have ordered more than once and can&#x27;t get enough of them. If I had to name the &amp;#34;worst&amp;#34; part is that I wish they lasted longer than a few months, but it still doesn&#x27;t stop me from getting more. Great job!</li>
    <li> Slept with it just one night and dramatically reduced my wrinkles from years of sun damage and sleeping on my side.  I didn&#x27;t find it uncomfortable at all to sleep in.  I wish I had known about these years ago!  I&#x27;ve tried sleeping on my back and just can&#x27;t!  These are perfect to use daily or just for special occaisions so you can look good in that low-cut dress.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t listen to the negative comments and gave it a try.  Will definitely be purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> Works well to temporarily smooth away those vertical cleavage lines.  Wear it for an hour, and it lasts for 1-2hrs.</li>
    <li> This patch lasts only a few wears then it doesnt stick. Took care of it as directed. Dissapointed in the price of this for only a few wears. Sent an email to seller nothing was done.</li>
    <li> love this product you do need to replace every 2 to 3.Weeks but it works to keep deep wrinkles from forming</li>
    <li> I was amazed how quickly these pads work.  You can see the difference after the first overnight use, and it continues to get better.  I&#x27;ve had these side-sleeping chest wrinkles for at least 10 years, probably more.  I&#x27;d say after day 3, the lines were reduced about 75%, which is pretty amazing.  However, I&#x27;m now getting red rashy bumps in my cleavage.  Not great . . . .  I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s something on or in the pad that I&#x27;m allergic to, although I&#x27;m not really allergic to anything.  I guess I&#x27;ll stop using the pad for a few days to see if the rash goes away.  Then I&#x27;ll give it another try.  Keeping my fingers crossed because it really does work on the wrinkles.</li>
    <li> They delivered quickly and I got exactly what I ordered!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to get rid of those decolletage lines. Worn while you sleep.</li>
    <li> A lit of reviewers are disappointed because they have to buy them every 3-4 weeks. If possible, just cut them in half and voila! Two for one! I actually found them to be much more comfortable and did just as good of a job after using only half of a pad. Fortunately my chest wrinkles aren&#x27;t spread out much so the skinnier size worked great. These absolutely do work. The wrinkles come back easily, but they sure do disappear whenever I use these.</li>
    <li> This seems to be doing what it is supposed to.  I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but the results were better than I expected.  Of course, it is not permanent plus I don&#x27;t know how long the pad will work, but for those times when I&#x27;d like my decolletage  to look younger, I&#x27;ll use this.</li>
    <li> I absolutely can not live without these!! I have been using them for a couple of years now. I am 46 and have NO chest wrinkles and I am a side sleeper!! Simply put, THEY WORK!!!</li>
    <li> I liked this product at first.  But I find they don&#x27;t stay on well at night.  When I wake up in the morning the pad has migrated around to different places on my chest.  I don&#x27;t use cream on the area first or anything.  I&#x27;m lucky if the pad lasts a month.  But the worst problem is the this product really irritates the skin on my chest and makes it feel rough and red.  It went away when I quite using the pad for several weeks.  I think it leaves some sort of residue on my skin that really irritates it.  I don&#x27;t even use it anymore.  I&#x27;ve been trying the long scar sheets on my chest instead.  They don&#x27;t irritate my skin, but they aren&#x27;t as thick as I&#x27;d like them to be -- but they seem to be helping because my chest wrinkles are greatly diminished.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle! It works and I think it&#x27;s worth the money, creams never worked like this does- worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I wear this every night....even helps me sleep in a better position.  Just ordered my second one.  I wash it as suggested and the stickiness lasts.</li>
    <li> These work as great as everyone is saying in the other reviews. From the first night I see a dramatic difference! I could tell that the Kush was not going to deliver results and these don&#x27;t require you to keep something held in place all night, it remains in place effortlessly in its own. Will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> I just received the Decollete Pad yesterday and wore it last night, there is already a drastic improvement in my chest wrinkles, which I have been battling for 3-5 years.  The deep wrinkles that I wake up with in the morning are completely gone.  I am hoping and have complete faith that with regular use it will also help to smooth out the fine wrinkles that are perceptible only by me.  Without a doubt I will keep my bed stand fully stocked with these pads for years to come.</li>
    <li> The product works but it only lasts about a month since it is no longer sticky after applying it to the chest regularly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had laser treatments and resurfacing treatments (HUNDREDS of dollars) that did nothing for the deep wrinkles on my chest due to sun damage and sleeping on my side.  Placement was a little difficult at first - getting it just in the right spot so it didn&#x27;t bother me at night. I find it easier to lie on the bed to position it before I go to sleep.  Try this - it really does work!</li>
    <li> This pad is great and really smoothes out the chest skin. I sometimes find it uncomfortable to sleep in because I am a restless sidesleeper. I wish these were made for the face like a mask because I really think they smooth and plump fine lines. You can wear it for a few hours before going out and you will still see results although not permanent without regular wear.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review for any product or service, but this product is so incredible, I feel compelled!  I&#x27;ve recently gained weight and have since become &amp;#34;busty&amp;#34;.  Along with a larger and rounder bust came verticle chest wrinkles that show up in the morning (I sleep on my side).  And not just fine line wrinkles, those things were deeply etched on the center of my chest and it usually takes several hours for them to fade, if at all.  The first night I used the silcskin decollette pad I woke to a smooth, completely line/wrinkle free decollette.  I have been using the same pad for about 10 days now and it is still working perfectly.  I did choose to not wear it one night and the wrinkles were back the next morning.  I do not see a change in my skin tone/texture (other than the lack of wrinkles), but I can see and feel how the pad prevents my chest skin from folding and collapsing, resulting in wrinkles.  If it does nothing for the condition of my skin, it will not bother me at all.  I&#x27;m sold based on how it is working against the wrinkles forming.  If it does improve the condition of my skin, that&#x27;s just a cherry on the icing on the cake.</li>
    <li> I am a side sleeper and have tried a million ways and products to prevent the chest wrinkles when I sleep. This is by far the BEST product I have tried to date. It does exactly what it says it&#x27;s going to do. I wear it every single night and my chest looks twenty years younger. I saw the difference the first night I wore it. I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes. I will be buying a lot more of them in the near future.</li>
    <li> i am a 62-year old woman. through genetics, cuz growing up there was nothing about  sun block and retinol, i have not lined or wrinkled too much.  but what i what i did get was \\&quot;crepey,\\&quot; orange peel skin between my breasts (full figured) and some lines. i have used this product along with Hyaluronic Acid Serum for about a week and the orange peel/crepiness is almost gone! honest. i will keep you posted if things change or how glue holds out, but for now i am so jazzed i want a full body silicon case!&lt;br /&gt;July 14, 2014  my crepey skin is almost gone and the skin around it is smooth, but in the area the triangle covers. Wish there was something for the neck rings! It is a fantastic product and i am going on a month and a half and it still sticks.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on these Decollette Pads and was convinced the product was worth trying.  I received my pad yesterday and put it on when I went to bed last night.  All I can say is wow! The lines on my chest were completely gone this morning.  I tried to find them with my glasses on and an 8X magnification mirror.  Gone!  These lines have been an embarrassment to me for a long time.  I started wearing higher neck shirts to hide them.  I have tried a variety of creams and peels to get rid of the lines to no avail. I realize that the lines are from sleeping, and if I don&#x27;t wear the pad, the lines will come back. I am very happy with this product and will definitely purchase more.  The pads are supposed to last 30-60 days.  I don&#x27;t know about that yet, but I will happily bear the expense rather than the embarrassment of chest wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This really works!!!!  I was told by a friend to try these...and was somewhat reluctant.  But wow...I wish I would have taken a photo of the before.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference in my wrinkles but after only 1 month of use the pad comes half off during the night. I followed the care instructions however the pad didn&#x27;t last as long as I hoped for the money.</li>
    <li> I use silicone scar pads under my eyes at night to &amp;#34;offset&amp;#34; the sleep wrinkles that love to come up during the night.  I discovered Tac Gel a while ago and have been using it ever since to lengthen the amount of time I can use the pads because it keeps them sticky.  It&#x27;s WONDERFUL stuff:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/TAC-Gel-Tac-50-grams/dp/B000K4YZWU/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1424574242&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;tac+gel</li>
    <li> This pad works great if you are a side sleeper and of a certain age. For the price I wish there were 2 in a package as the stickiness wears off after so many wearings.</li>
    <li> I am a side sleeper and when I first saw a few lines on my chest I began to contemplate becoming a back sleeper.  But before changing the way I like to sleep I did some research...and WOW!  After ONE use I was hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is comfortable (barely notice it is on) and doesn&#x27;t look horrible (for having a sticker on your chest).  Just be sure to place it on the area you intend to and that you don&#x27;t accidentally crease your skin while applying the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is absolutely amazing and I will keep using for as long as I can foresee.</li>
    <li> Amazing solution to crease lines.</li>
    <li> Side sleeper. Work great. Used these for long time. No wrinkles at all décolleté area.</li>
    <li> I like these pads - they really do seem to minimize these chest wrinkles I&#x27;ve developed over the past couple years (I am 54 yrs old sidesleeper).  They don&#x27;t last more than about 3 wks even with cleaning, so I subscribed to monthly deliveries.  Now I&#x27;m tempted to try the ones for my forehead &amp; eyes!</li>
    <li> It works well, stays in place and it does do what is says.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading all these positive reviews but I could only use it for a couple of nights. I couldn&#x27;t sleep with it, it felt so uncomfortable especially when sleeping on my side. It felt like something was suffocating me. I give it 3 starts because it does help with wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Besides the fact that they are hard to clean, this pad is awesome and very effective.  Find a way to clean the thing and it&#x27;s worth the money paid hands down.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this!!!works better than I ever thought it would. I will definitely be buying again and telling my friends about it</li>
    <li> Great product! Works even better with the chest pillow available also on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The stickiness eventually wears off and you&#x27;ll need a new one- that&#x27;s the only down side.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product - perhaps that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m disappointed. I&#x27;m a side sleeper and despite trying to train myself to sleep on my back, I inevitably would turn in the night. My chest wrinkles started becoming apparent last year when I was 37. The product does seem high quality and as described. You apply the product at night, making sure your chest is clean, dry, and lotion free. The adhesive seems strong. But when I wore it in the night, I found it was itchy - not a reaction to the adhesive but because it was slightly tugging on my skin when I was on my side. I just can&#x27;t see wearing it every night in that condition. I feel like if it were thinner, perhaps it wouldn&#x27;t be as uncomfortable. I also delayed buying this because I thought the price was a little high - if you used this regularly, you&#x27;d end up buying 10-12 per year, which would be upwards of $300/year. Right now, I&#x27;ve resorted to wearing a sports bra with socks in a bunched ball in the middle to keep the girls separated at a night. Works okay. I might have to resign myself to chest wrinkles (which is particularly frustrating because my non-augmented chest is small).</li>
    <li> This is thick and uncomfortable and just promotes folds amount itself. So I have not found this to be very helpful.</li>
    <li> They really do work, very sticky to begin with, then loses it after awhile, but they do work.</li>
    <li> i love this product! It really works. You will notce after wearing it one time overnight the change in your skin. I have been using this for a month now and i will never stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;so easy to use and each pad last the 30 days it claims it would. I wish i had found this product years ago.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m almost 50 years old and spend a lot of time in the sun. This Decollette Pad is a god send!</li>
    <li> It feels uncomfortable wearing it, it doesn&#x27;t help that much and it&#x27;s really expensive ($30 for 30 uses, that&#x27;s $1 per day, I&#x27;d have to order a case for a year&#x27;s supply!)</li>
    <li> After two laser resurfacing procedures and countless creams, peels, and even a pillow that looks completely ridiculous, i tried these pads.  I have been using them for 8 months and can&#x27;t sleep without them!  What a difference these little miracles make!  You will get results on the first night, Stick with this product and those results become better and better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and now order 2 at a time so when the magic is gone, I have a new one right away.  On average I get 35 to 40 days. You can clean them with a little rubbing alcohol and get a week or so extra! This is a &amp;#34;can&#x27;t live without&amp;#34; product for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember ladies, consistency counts...When you use this product use it every night and you will see amazing results!</li>
    <li> I tend to sleep  on my side which causes wrinkling, even though it disappears after a while I am afraid down the road it may become permanent. When I came across this product the reviews were positive , so I thought why not give it a try. I have used it for 3 night and so far it does what it claims . Lets see how long it lasts</li>
    <li> These things are great!  I use one every night and my chest is always wrinkle free.</li>
    <li> Not so good. The neck one causes redness and wrinkles</li>
    <li> The item was delivered quickly and works exactly as described. Will definitely order this product again!</li>
    <li> Surprised that after just a couple times of wearing this at night that those nasty little creases in my chest area were 95%  gone.  I do have to wear it again from time to time for &amp;#34;maintenance,&amp;#34; but truly amazed how well this worked.</li>
    <li> Amazing Results after one use!!!  This will be part of my beauty regimen forever!!  My chest wrinkles practically disappeared!</li>
    <li> I feel like the decolelletage area is the one area that shows your age (just like hands). This product works - no more wrinkles in the chest area!!! If you lose the stickiness, get some tacky glue for medical use: http://smile.amazon.com/Tensive-Conductive-Adhesive-Gel-Laboratories/dp/B00AMGVFSS/ref&#x3D;sr_1_fkmr1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1427334539&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1-fkmr1&amp;keywords&#x3D;Tacky+conductive+gel+for+skin</li>
    <li> This works if you use it and you do not sleep on your side. It is very challenging for me to sleep because it sticks to my chest and then bubbles/separates which wakes me up when I turn on my side. Works well if you lay flat on your back however, I would not have chest issues if I simply slept on my back. Will most likely not purchase one again.</li>
    <li> This works but I have a hard time remember to use it at night.  I can not wear it in the day time.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but thought I&#x27;d give it a try anyway. After one night, I couldn&#x27;t believe the improvement I will definitely buy this again</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I am a side sleeper, and it is inevitable, every morning, I would wake up with vertical lines on my chest.  If I use the decollette pad at night, I have zero chest wrinkles in the morning...ZERO.  Love love love.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how it can erase wrinkles!  It really works wonders. I wish could get one for a few other places as well.</li>
    <li> This product does work! After 39 years of being a side sleeper (with a large chest), I was developing deep wrinkles. After trying various creams and attempting being a back sleeper, I decided to give this product a try. It really does help! I&#x27;d estimate that the appearance of my chest wrinkles are 75% less with just a few days of use. It took a few nights to get used to the feel of sleeping with it on. I&#x27;ve taken one star off because I don&#x27;t think it lasts a full 30 days.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe that this actually works, but it does. After even one usage while I slept. My one complaint is that it is not big enough. I rectify that by putting on different spots each night. I&#x27;m recommending this to everyone I know. How had I never heard of this product before?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d rather have wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Good product. Unfortunately I woke up with red marks one day after using this pad and had to massage my skin to get back to normal.</li>
    <li> Gets rid of my night time chest wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I have used the décolleté pillows and they would either come out or were uncomfortable. This product stays put once it is applied. I have also been able to tell a huge difference in this area. I&#x27;m a side sleeper and my boobs aren&#x27;t small so the wrinkles were definitely noticeable. I have used this for about 2 weeks and the wrinkles are pretty much unnoticeable! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but read the reviews and got excited. I received this and used it once or twice and forgot about it. Then I found it again a few weeks ago and have used it every night since. My chest is wrinkle free. This is amazing. I had deep creases in the upper chest area. I bought this to see if it would tighten the crepey skin righ between my breasts. I&#x27;ve ordered a second one and am going to wear them both at night.</li>
    <li> Really does works. I sleep on my side and was starting to get permanent lines. Since I started using this they are virtually gone.</li>
    <li> It works great for wrinkles and is very comfortable.  Wish it was easier to clean with out removing some of the sticky</li>
    <li> Loved it the first week!  I was amazed that this chest pad actually worked the first use! I loved it. The instructions do say to wash it every use. Did. But the sticky only lasted a few weeks. Most of the adhesion was gone from the sides which left it flopping in the middle of the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hated how short lived it was for the hefty price I paid.</li>
    <li> what good is this if it rolls off your chest when you lay down? it didnt stay in place unless i was standing up.</li>
    <li> This product definitely works.  When I wear it to bed, i wake up with absolutely no wrinkles.  If i don&#x27;t wear it, yuk!  I only wish they would last longer.  I wear mine for about 3 weeks.  Then I need a new one.</li>
</ol>
