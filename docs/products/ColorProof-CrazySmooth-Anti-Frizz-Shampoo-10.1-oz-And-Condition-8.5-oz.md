      <li>Leaves hair feeling clean, smooth and shiny.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re wondering if it&#x27;s worth the price, it is!</li>
      <li>This is the first shampoo and conditioner that I will spend this amount of money on since it has made my hair so healthy looking.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this is a knock off, not the product advertised.</li>
      <li>but my hair is in such good condition using this shampoo.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair full of body with no frizz.</li>
      <li>My stylist said to make sure it is rinsed out very thoroughly.</li>
      <li>best shampoo and conditioner ever at HALF THE PRICE!!!</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t beat the price and always receive quickly</li>
      <li>CrazySmooth Anti-Frizz Label - my new favorite &amp; go to shampoo &amp; conditioner</li>
      <li>When I do this, I run out the hot water for my household!</li>
      <li>My hair is soft and easy to detangle after using these products.</li>
      <li>It is much more runny and it does not smell the same.</li>
      <li>My hair dresser sells this product for more than double what I paid online.</li>
      <li>Highly concentrated, smells good, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down and fights those frizzies!</li>
      <li>I have noticed it takes a bit more time to dry</li>
      <li>and my hair feels so soft and is very shiny!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Color Proof products and was purchasing from a local hair salon.  </li>
      <li>Thanks so much</li>
      <li>I use both UNITE and this brand, and if I want a &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; day - whether it be curly or straight - this is the shampoo / conditioner combo I&#x27;ll turn to.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t really like the smell and made my hair very greasy.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t notice much an improvement.  </li>
      <li>I can use about a nickel sized amount of this product to wash my whole head.</li>
      <li>It is very economical to use because I only need to use a dime sized dollop.  </li>
      <li>My color looks fabulous long after I get it done</li>
      <li>Presto - new hair care routine!</li>
      <li>After I started using these two products, my hair always turns out softer, and the dryness is significantly  improved; I do  add a high quality styling conditioner before drying and using  a flat iron to straighten the curls.</li>
      <li>love it....same as salon at half the cost</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>I have fine, naturally curly hair which tends to be dry.  </li>
      <li>leaves your hair conditioned and very soft.  </li>
      <li>It smells funny &amp; definitely doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft as the product I&#x27;m use to using.</li>
      <li>I should really thank my stylist for turning me on to it, but Amazon wins for pricing hands down.</li>
      <li>I love the Crazy Smooth oil</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m usually a Volumizing formula girl but for some reason the CrazySmooth was significantly cheaper</li>
      <li>It works decent, just not what I expected.</li>

<li> I have very long, coarse very dry hair and usually let it dry naturally.  </li>
<li> You only need a tiny amount I am told- the small bottles are meant to last for 3+ months.</li>
<li> and when I go to blow dry my hair, it is still left feeling greasy and weighed down.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m breastfeeding &amp; nervous to actually continue to use b/c of the odd smell.</li>

    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much an improvement.  I prefer their Plush Locks Leave-In Smooth.  Love that.</li>
    <li> love it....same as salon at half the cost</li>
    <li> I love all ColorProof products. These are by far the best products I have ever used. These 2 bottles lasted me about 10 months. I wash my hair every other day, and I&#x27;m pretty heavy handed. My color looks fabulous long after I get it done and my hair feels so soft and is very shiny!!</li>
    <li> I have fine, naturally curly hair which tends to be dry.  After I started using these two products, my hair always turns out softer, and the dryness is significantly  improved; I do  add a high quality styling conditioner before drying and using  a flat iron to straighten the curls.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser just turned me on to this duo - best ever -Colorpoof CrazySmooth Anti-Frizz Label - my new favorite &amp; go to shampoo &amp; conditioner - AWESOME!!!!!</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair very clean, shiny, smooth and without frizz.</li>
    <li> Expensive but worth it because you don&#x27;t need as much as other shampoos.</li>
    <li> This product is not consistent with what I have purchased in salons. It is much more runny and it does not smell the same. My hair is getting greasy. It seems as if something other then the advertised product was put into this bottle.</li>
    <li> Been using the CrazySmooth shampoo and conditioner for almost a year.  Very pleased</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really like the smell and made my hair very greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Color Proof products and was purchasing from a local hair salon.  My stylist switched salons and her current one doesn&#x27;t to carry this product line.  I was so pleased to have found it on Amazon and for a much better price.</li>
    <li> Love the smell! I&#x27;ve used lots of products and I always end up going back to this brand! Lasts forever because it only requires a small amount per wash</li>
    <li> I have very long, coarse very dry hair and usually let it dry naturally.  It is very economical to use because I only need to use a dime sized dollop.  To get the most of the conditioner I leave it in and don&#x27;t rinse it out.

    <li> Absolute best smoothing + anti frizz shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product. My hair is soft and easy to detangle after using these products.</li>
    <li> best shampoo and conditioner ever at HALF THE PRICE!!! I&#x27;m in love!</li>
    <li> Excellent product - controls frizz plus leaves hair manageable especially when used with CrazySmooth Conditioner.  Only a small amount of shampoo is required - even with hard water.  The product does what it says it will do - what more can you ask for in a product.</li>
    <li> Will never buy any other brand, ever.</li>
    <li> Great product. Delivered on-time!</li>
    <li> This line of products is the best anti-frizz and smoothing line I have ever used. I have very thin hair but a LOT of it, and it hates moisture... I can use about a nickel sized amount of this product to wash my whole head. It&#x27;s worth the money! I&#x27;m thankful Amazon provides it at a better price, too.</li>
    <li> I use both UNITE and this brand, and if I want a &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; day - whether it be curly or straight - this is the shampoo / conditioner combo I&#x27;ll turn to.  I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Fast shipping!!! Thanks so much :) I will be buying from yall everytime!</li>
    <li> I used to like this system a great deal. Now it just feels like it is weighing down my hair terribly. My stylist said to make sure it is rinsed out very thoroughly. When I do this, I run out the hot water for my household! It never seems rinsed out enough and when I go to blow dry my hair, it is still left feeling greasy and weighed down. You only need a tiny amount I am told- the small bottles are meant to last for 3+ months. But I have yet to find that perfect balance of my hair feeling clean, yet not greasy.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this shampoo and conditioner. Best duo to tame frizz during those humid days. Highly concentrated, smells good, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down and fights those frizzies!</li>
    <li> Love these products♡ I paid twice this price at the spa.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Keeps your hair so smooth smells great gotta love this one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is a knock off, not the product advertised. It smells funny &amp; definitely doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft as the product I&#x27;m use to using. I&#x27;m breastfeeding &amp; nervous to actually continue to use b/c of the odd smell. Definitely don&#x27;t recommend this purchase.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price and always receive quickly</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the same as salon product. It doesn&#x27;t smell or perform the same</li>
    <li> Love this set ! Makes your hair more manageable !!!</li>
    <li> I love the products.  It leaves my hair full of body with no frizz.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner!!!</li>
    <li> leaves your hair conditioned and very soft.  I have noticed it takes a bit more time to dry but my hair is in such good condition using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Love this! Service was fast and excellent!!</li>
    <li> This set is amazing.  I use this set with the treatment oil and plushlocks.  The scents all work together amazingly well and leave my hair shiny, smooth and smelling great!  I have chin length, medium-weight, THICK THICK THICK hair, so smooth is key for my hair or else it turns into a massive puffball.  No worries with this duo!!  Presto - new hair care routine!</li>
    <li> The best stuff and price ever for this product !!</li>
    <li> Best shampoo &amp; conditioner on the market for the ladies in my life : )</li>
    <li> This is the first shampoo and conditioner that I will spend this amount of money on since it has made my hair so healthy looking.  Not to mention that it smells and feels great.  Love these products!</li>
    <li> Wonderful shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair. No sulfates and a great fragrance. Leaves hair feeling clean, smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> It leaves my hair dull &amp; frizzy. Really disappointing. I love the Crazy Smooth oil but this the shampoo and conditioner are terrible!</li>
    <li> I love these products. Super good for my hair but nd I hate that I am required to write a set amount of words. That is why I don&#x27;t want to rate things,</li>
    <li> My hair is: Dry, wavy, coarse, color treated, and bleached.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Did not strip my color.&lt;br /&gt;Con:  strong scented, made my hair dryer, made my hair poufy, in the shower lost more hair than usual.&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend for someone with my type of hair. Might work better for oily hair.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps :-)</li>
    <li> Yes I love it!! Thank you, Kristy M</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what kind of magic they put in their products, but ColorProof is always spot-on. I&#x27;m usually a Volumizing formula girl but for some reason the CrazySmooth was significantly cheaper so I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m glad I did - this stuff is great. My hair has always been a nightmare to deal with (all at once fine - but a lot of it, frizzy, long, curl resistant, dull, limp) but after using this (plus the conditioner, detangler, and serum) I&#x27;m now &amp;#34;the girl with good hair&amp;#34;. I should really thank my stylist for turning me on to it, but Amazon wins for pricing hands down. If you&#x27;re wondering if it&#x27;s worth the price, it is! It lasts FOREVER, your hair will never look better, and as a bonus it smells incredible.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. Makes my hair so silky and helps keep color.</li>
