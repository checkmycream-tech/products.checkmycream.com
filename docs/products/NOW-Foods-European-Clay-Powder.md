      <li>It was easy to apply and easy to rinse</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>Drinking clay in water is known to improve digestion, give better circulation, offer a higher quality of sleep, give more energy, decrease depression, and strengthen the immune system.</li>

      <li>After removal my face seemed smooth and exfoliated.</li>
      <li>this clay is awesome for soaking in the tub and it wasnt really messy for me</li>
      <li>Pure, very fine texture.  </li>
      <li>This clay is worth every penny!</li>
      <li>Also like to mix with pure Jojoba oil for a more moisture-intensive mask.  </li>
      <li>and it has lasted her a long time, and I tried it and liked it!</li>
      <li>I have used it on my face, chest, and thighs to help clear everything up for the warm weather.</li>
      <li>Since I added the moisturizing ingredients, it didn&#x27;t dry my face out, and it shrunk my pores and made my skin look amazing!</li>
      <li>Great in making face masks and other beauty products.</li>
      <li>If this bothers you, just follow it up with a quick swig of water afterwards.</li>
      <li>Stir well and drink quickly.  </li>
      <li>I received this quickly.  </li>
      <li>He kept his finger wrapped in it for 15 minutes and was amazed how quickly it took the soreness</li>

      <li>Overall, pretty good.</li>
      <li>Love the natural stuff!</li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s only $7), and I hope it works for you as amazingly as it works for me.</li>
      <li>Even if this has nothing to do with my acne going away, it&#x27;s still making my actual skin looks amazing.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>So far, I really love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I am enjoying using this product so far.</li>
      <li>Unlike other clay masks, this works best when you add equal portions of water and powder.  </li>
      <li>After I use this stuff I see that the mask is pulling them right out of my skin</li>
      <li>Another great ingredient is organic green tea!  </li>
      <li>Large pieces!</li>
      <li>The powder has no scent, it&#x27;s all natural, and it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I did not expect that and had a nice mess to clean in my bathroom sink.</li>
      <li>The first time I used this, after completely rinsing it out, I thought: meh, It&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>Here is the website I found that gives EXACT instructions for drinking the clay.</li>
      <li>Then I moisten my fingers and tap on just enough water to be able to spread it around.</li>
      <li>I mostly just use the clay for my nose now and seriously instant results!!</li>
      <li>This was my first time using a face mask.</li>
      <li>This really makes my skin  glow!  </li>
      <li>I am giving this product 5 stars because you are getting a lot for your money and it does exactly what it claims and thats purifies the skin and leaves it soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love it and will definitely buy it again!</li>
      <li>Might not use the entire container, but ok while I have it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Amazing stuff. The ONLY thing that works to get rid of my blackheads and they are REALLY hard for me to get out. I would say its impossible for mine to come out without this clay. After I use this stuff I see that the mask is pulling them right out of my skin (it really tugs as it dries) It has also reduced my pore size! I don&#x27;t want try try anything else but clay now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; On the back it says to mix with jojoba and lavender for dry skin. When I wipe it off...it isn&#x27;t drying and very refreshing (it may be more drying without combination..i&#x27;m not sure). I would recommend using a little vitamin E oil to moisturize your face afterwards. My mother has sensitive skin and the combination I used for her burned her skin, I&#x27;d be cautious if you have very sensitive skin. Try the Red clay powder instead.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a facial mask about once every week or two for the past few months and my skin has never felt better. I saw instant results even after the first time I used it. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, my pores are slightly getting smaller. I usually hold it on my face for 30 min to 1 hour. If you have oily skin DO NOT ADD any oil to it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 20 years old and I&#x27;ve had acne since puberty, and have tried every face wash to get it to go away. I bought this stuff, used it, and instantly my face looked awesome. My skin was amazing and bright, but of course the acne was still there... I&#x27;ve only used it once, but five days later, my acne is slowly going away. My pores are smaller thanks for this, and I&#x27;m taking some homeopathic acne medicine, it might be the winning combination to make my acne go away. Even if this has nothing to do with my acne going away, it&#x27;s still making my actual skin looks amazing. Pores are smaller, and my skin looks fresh, it has a kind of glow to it. So far, I really love this stuff. It wasn&#x27;t too expensive either!</li>
    <li> Shipping was amazingly fast. Tried the product last night, mixed with activated charcoal, water, and a few drops of Argan oil. Great product. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> this clay is awesome for soaking in the tub and it wasnt really messy for me i do wish it was a little bit bigger container but other then that its was fine for me</li>
    <li> I purchased this European Clay Powder on 6/15/12 and received it today, 6/20/12.  I used it and I let it stay on my face for approximately 10 min. After I washed and rinsed my face, it felt sooo good. This was my first time using a face mask. I will definitely by purchasing this again before I run out.</li>
    <li> Love it. Makes my skin super soft.</li>
    <li> I do not recommend it. this product did nothing, I would call it the biggest lie</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I just got it and I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far, but I could see a difference after the first time! My face feels so much tighter and my pores are visibly smaller. It makes my face glow! Absolutely love it and will definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this powdered clay!  The powder has no scent, it&#x27;s all natural, and it&#x27;s easy to use.  Unlike other clay masks, this works best when you add equal portions of water and powder.  You may want to use 1.5 tablespoons if you want to get a thicker consistency to the mask; this will also reduce cracking.  After 10-15min on your face, the mask will gently tug at your skin as it dries -- you may also feel itchiness in areas where the mask is cracking (so try to make a mask with a thicker consistency).  The clay washes off pretty easily, I used a facial sponge to help me but it definitely was not needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is probably best for individuals with oily and/or rough skin.  It definitely exfoliates your skin, smooths over rough patches and gives you a brighter appearance.  I was quite shocked at how soft and bright my face looked after using this mask.  You definitely should use a good moisturizer or hydrating toner after using this (just to bring back balance to your skin).</li>
    <li> I am using this clay powder in combination with raw cacao powder and baking soda as a face powder.  This combination seems to be working well, as I have sensitive skin.  Though the ingredients were initially expensive, I anticipate that they will last quite a while.</li>
    <li> very easy to mix the water and clay. Clay really does wonders for my pores. Word of caution, don&#x27;t do what I did and try to clay mask your entire face on the first try. As the clay dries it&#x27;ll start shrinking pulling your skin with it. I have quite sensitive skin so the shrinkage was really irritating. I mostly just use the clay for my nose now and seriously instant results!!</li>
    <li> This works really well. Left my pores very clean. I could actually tell a difference in my nose. Just know it will come off your face in large chunks when removing the mask. I did not expect that and had a nice mess to clean in my bathroom sink. I suggest wiping your face off with a washcloth over a towel or trashcan. Large pieces!</li>
    <li> I liked the product ok. I bought it for wraps but it is so small I could only wrap twice.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this clay powder!  It&#x27;s a simple way to tighten, detoxify and rejuvenate sagging, tired skin in the morning and/or late afternoon.  I use this powder to make various mask recipes..one of my favorites being a simple mix of negative ion charged water, European clay powder and 12% Vitamin C serum (about 6 drops).  This really makes my skin  glow!  Also like to mix with pure Jojoba oil for a more moisture-intensive mask.  Another great ingredient is organic green tea!  Just steep a bag in about 2 ounces of hot water for about 10 minutes and squeeze the bag of concentrated green tea directly on about a teaspoon of the clay powder and mix!  This versatile clay powder also lasts a long time, as a little can go a long way!  LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> This clay powder works great for the project that I bought is for. I am experimenting with all natural products.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product!  However, even with greasy skin (you could cook a chicken with my face at the end of the day...), this does dry our my skin the day after I use it.  I just used some tea tree oil with my mix, and it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> my favorite french green clay, I mix it with sea breeze for a tingly, clarifying mask :)</li>
    <li> Excellent product! It worked great like it should be because I saw the immediate result after using it.</li>
    <li> I received this quickly.  I made a face mask with this powder and distilled water, left on for 20 minutes and rinsed off.  It doesn&#x27;t take much quantity to cover your entire face and the results are very nice. It was easy to apply and easy to rinse off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my husband hurt his finger doing yard work so I made a poultice with this clay, powdered mustard and apple cider vinegar.  He kept his finger wrapped in it for 15 minutes and was amazed how quickly it took the soreness away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used the clay powder as an ingredient in homemade mineral veil (clay powder, arrowroot powder and cocoa powder) and it works nicely for that as well.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and will definitely order it again.</li>
    <li> This is a nice fine powder and it does what it says. I mixed it with water the first time and it dried very hard. After removal my face seemed smooth and exfoliated. Each time I have used it since then I added a drop or two of jojoba oil to keep my face from getting too dry. The oil makes it set up softer. I have used it on my face, chest, and thighs to help clear everything up for the warm weather. This is a basic clay powder that does the job and isn&#x27;t overly special, a nice base to customize your facial if you are into that kinda stuff. Or, fine to use as is.</li>
    <li> Love it. Made a wonderful Green-tea cleansing mask with it. Absolutely wonderful.</li>
    <li> I love this powder. It&#x27;s great for combination skin. I use it twice a week and it does the job after a long day of work.  Fast shipping and affordable</li>
    <li> Gets super tight when it dries!!  I do feel like I&#x27;m less shiny the next day and less blackheads.  Will continue to use</li>
    <li> Great in making face masks and other beauty products. Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this.  Do like &amp;#34;NOW&amp;#34; products and this was no exception.</li>
    <li> This is definitely not a weak mask, or for those with sensitive skin. My skin is fairly sensitive, and I couldn&#x27;t leave it on until it fully dried. It became very itchy and burned a bit. Right after i washed it off my face became bright red! Looks like I have a splotchy sunburn. However, it has calmed down a little bit. I have a breakout on my forehead and they have flattened out a little bit. My skin feels much smoother, but a tad dry. I&#x27;ll probably have to add more water or an essential oil next time. Overall, pretty good. Might not use the entire container, but ok while I have it.</li>
    <li> Here is the website I found that gives EXACT instructions for drinking the clay. I am starting the 3 month cleanse on Sunday and am expecting to drop many lbs with a diet change and daily exercise. Enjoy!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Google this information for the website - hope for health European green clay - and it is the second link</li>
    <li> I have oily skin I tried this with the recommended lavender oil and substituted almond oil for jojoba oil which I didn&#x27;t have. I also have sensitive skin it felt tingly while it was on, when I washed it off, my face was bright red and burning didn&#x27;t feel like tackling the cold to cut an aloe leaf so I applied a squirt of Argan oil to my face. It&#x27;s cooling down a bit. What I like so far about this mask is that it not only washed immediately out of the wash cloth I was using, but left it feeling super soft. The other clay masks I&#x27;ve tried like queen Helene have ruined wash clothes I&#x27;ve used. So I&#x27;m convinced this is better for my skin on that basis alone at the moment, will see what happens with my face going forward</li>
    <li> I bought this French clay to make cleansing grains with. It truly is detoxifying. After your cleaned out and healed (a week or so) your skin feels so fresh and looks marvelous.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t always use face masks, as some of the ones I used in the past irritated my skin. I decided to give this one a shot, because it is all natural, and I can add oils and other thing to it and customize it to my own skin. I added a small amount of aloe vera gel and coconut oil to this powder and adjusted the amount of water I added. I had great results! Since I added the moisturizing ingredients, it didn&#x27;t dry my face out, and it shrunk my pores and made my skin look amazing! My husband was also impressed. I showed him how great my skin looked, and he agreed. He said it looked like I had foundation or powder on, because it seemed to even my skin tone so well! I will continue to use this mask once or twice a week, and although the jar seems small, with the small amount I need it should last a while. I will definitely recommend this to family &amp; friends, and repurchase in the future! :)</li>
    <li> I am giving this product 5 stars because you are getting a lot for your money and it does exactly what it claims and thats purifies the skin and leaves it soft and smooth. I did my research on this product before purchasing and was pleasantly suprised. It does have a long shelf life so this is something that you will have for a while. It does tighten up on the skin to draw the impurities out so just know that it can be a little uncomfortable when it starts to dry around the 15 minute mark however you can leave the mask on as long as you would like. You are to remoisturize your skin after use because it leaves the skin dry.Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this, after completely rinsing it out, I thought: meh, It&#x27;s fine. I mean, my skin was smooth and all but I didnt see anything wowing me. I tend to get a bunch of tiny blackheads around my nose, and on my left cheek I had like a couple of pores that were too big and clogged with whiteheads and blackheads and even some zits... You get the picture. Not pretty. So right after when I just noticed that there was minor cleaning and softness I was somewhat dissapointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But magically, after days of not using this, but just keeping my daily routine of oatmeal soap, tonic and moisturizer, The pores  and the zits started to get smaller and the blackheads on my nose to dissapear. You could say that it was because of my routine and not because of this Clay. But man, I&#x27;ve been using the same routine since forever and nothing had changed like it did now. So I think the real effects start showing after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im still using the clay mask once a week plus my daily routine and im been doing great.</li>
    <li> Pure, very fine texture.  I use this to make mineral face powder and deoderant.  It is a good quantity for the price.</li>
    <li> I have normal to oily skin... this product really worked great. Just would recommend putting oil or moisturizer afterwards. Kinda makes your skin red but goes away quickly</li>
    <li> I looked at a lot of similar clay powders before finally deciding on this one. The price is what ultimately won me over. The packaging is not like what&#x27;s pictured on the product page, but that is not an issue. I am definitely satisfied with my purchase. The clay powder works just as described. It gets tight as it dries, but it&#x27;s not overly uncomfortable. I feel like my skin is cleaner and softer after I remove the mask. You only use one tablespoon at a time so this little jar will last me for a while. I use it once a week. I am enjoying using this product so far. I&#x27;ve used it twice. It arrived on time and in great condition.</li>
    <li> Eh. Not that great. I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
    <li> I use this as a mask.  It is lovely.  I don&#x27;t use soap on my face, and I use this about twice a week.  My skin has changed a lot since using clay.  Any clay will do, but I do like this one.  Now foods seem to have great products.</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t do anything...this is seriously over rated. if you want to see a difference in your face, make a turmeric face mask with yogurt.</li>
    <li> Bought for making my own makeup. Mixed with arrowroot powder and coca for color, this works well as a powder foundation! But don&#x27;t use too much- the green really stands out if you&#x27;re not careful with your measurements. People have been complementing my makeup since I switched. Love the natural stuff!</li>
    <li> The price of this clay is awesome.  I haven&#x27;t found a better price for Montmorillonite clay any where else....this one is pure with no other ingredients. This clay is known to come from Montmorillon, France.  Oddly for some, I actually bought this clay to drink, not for my skin. It is very akalining, absorbing acids.  Drinking clay in water is known to improve digestion, give better circulation, offer a higher quality of sleep, give more energy, decrease depression, and strengthen the immune system. It also contains loads of great, alkalining minerals.  There are no directions for drinking it on the bottle.  But I usually add 1 tsp of the clay to 1 cup of water three or four times a day.  Stir well and drink quickly.  It has a neutral taste, but is a bit gritty.  If this bothers you, just follow it up with a quick swig of water afterwards.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine had this and it has lasted her a long time, and I tried it and liked it! I do have dry skin though, so this isn&#x27;t something that I use very often, or I&#x27;ll use it as a spot treatment. I&#x27;ve experimented using it with coconut oil to be more hydrating, just water, and next I want to try jojoba. Great product.</li>
    <li> I have very dry and sensitive skin.  Its dryness makes it very attractive to dust and impurities etc, and I literally try every detox/cleansing mask I have heard of.  I bought this to meet amazon&#x27;s you-have-to-reach-$35-to-get-free-shipping rule.  And I am surprised with its result.  My skin definitely looks CLEAN, revitalized, and nourished without any added oil.  (I will try Avocado and Argon oil next time.)  I absolutely will add it to my routine, and may consider to replace the Borghese green mud mask with this, which I had been using for about 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the clay dries on the face, it did create a burning effect.  But on me, that means I left the mask longer than 20 minutes, which is over the recommend wearing time on the bottle.  Once I reduced the wearing time down to 15 minutes, it doesn&#x27;t give me any burning or redness, but only the positive results.  So I suggest those with sensitive skins wash it off before or when it starts to burn.  Give it a try (it&#x27;s only $7), and I hope it works for you as amazingly as it works for me.</li>
    <li> Great value!  A little goes a long way, and this will last forever.  A bit drying, I think it&#x27;s best for use only in the T zone. It cleared up my acne, the texture of my skin is smoother, and my blackheads are less noticeable.  I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> The clay powder is a good to help w/ getting your skin pores clean.  I use it once every two weeks with coconut oil.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Skips all the unnecessary extras and gets straight to the main thing... deep cleaning your face. You only need a small amount so it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you try making a thin paste before applying, it can be hard to get an even consistency. So instead I apply a very (very) small amount of dry powder with my fingertips to several areas of my face. Then I moisten my fingers and tap on just enough water to be able to spread it around. Great results every time.</li>
    <li> I would buy this again. I added too much water and jojoba oil the first time. We tried it only one time and it made my bf&#x27;s skin soft and less oily.</li>
    <li> I bought this powder to make masks using Jojoba Oil.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.  I used it twice a week for about a month and it really cleared up my acne.  I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and have tried just about everything to get clear skin.  I finally have it now and I know it&#x27;s because of this clay!  My skin always feels so smooth after masking and it&#x27;s so nice to receive compliments on my complexion.  This clay is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I threw away all my other crappy masks after I received this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clay is strong stuff, the skin is left feeling soft and smooth afterward, and it detoxes as well as unclogs pores.&lt;br /&gt;I go to this product when I have accidently fell asleep with my makeup on, and it makes those mistakes much more forgivable if you know what I mean.</li>
