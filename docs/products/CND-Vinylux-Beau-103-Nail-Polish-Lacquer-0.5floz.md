      <li>This is great.  </li>
      <li>Staying power is good</li>
      <li>I purchased this polish, \\&quot;Beau\\&quot; because I used CND \\&quot;Beau\\&quot; gel polish and loved the color.  </li>
      <li>Sure beats paying at the nail salon!</li>
      <li>I love this brand of polish!</li>

      <li>Perfect for enhancing your natural nail.</li>
      <li>Vinylux is supposed to be one of the top lacquer nail polishes that wear for 7-10 days.  </li>
      <li>Fantstic, especially with the top coat, looks great and LASTS!!</li>
      <li>I love being able to do my nails at home.</li>
      <li>I like this color (Beau) even better than Romantique</li>
      <li>but it requires many coats to achieve the color in the bottle.</li>
      <li>love that it lasts 7-10</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Love, love</li>
      <li>The top coat secured it well.  </li>
      <li>Fast-drying nail polish and lasts 4-5 days for me with the Vinylux top coat.</li>
      <li>so it adheres better.</li>
      <li>then Beau on top</li>
      <li>I love these products.</li>
      <li>I found that the polish held up for a week and was easy to remove at the end of week.  </li>
      <li>Perfect color for me and lasts longer than previous brand.</li>
      <li>Love how quickly it dries.</li>
      <li>This polish is so light in color that it&#x27;s not even work putting on.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Lacquer went on smoothly and evenly without any globbing.</li>
      <li>Also doesn&#x27;t need to be cured with light.</li>
      <li>it is a good product even if it doesn&#x27;t last a week as advertised.</li>
      <li>it is very pretty</li>
      <li>Love this new product.  </li>
      <li>CND Vinylux is the best polish ever because it lasts so long and can be removed with regular remover.  </li>
      <li>I love this sheer pink color - it is translucent and looks beautiful.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect them to have the identical staying power, so there was no disappointment there.  </li>
      <li>I am coming back for more colors.</li>
      <li>The color is lighter than I was hoping and is more sheer than i thought it would.  </li>
      <li>but it did not last more than 2-3 days before chipping.  </li>
      <li>that was what I first had on my nails.  </li>
      <li>Fabulous color for a natural look.</li>
      <li>and it looks clean and natural.</li>
      <li>The top coat also helps it to dry really fast saving me lots of time!</li>
      <li>I love the colors and the fact that it lasts a long time without chipping!</li>
      <li>Came off easy with regular remover.</li>
      <li>Very pretty and natural.</li>
      <li>Just much lighter than I wanted.</li>
      <li>It is my favorite of the pink shades from CND.  </li>
      <li>Terrific polish, use with the top coat, and lasts at least a week, if not longer; I work in kitchens, so my hands are in water most of the time, and this polish truly is a miracle if you don&#x27;t want to do acrylic or gels.</li>
      <li>Super nail polish...wonder why it took so long to be available to the public.  </li>
      <li>The gel color Beau was a beautiful pale pink; very natural.  </li>
      <li>, love this color - it is a semi-sheer soft pink</li>
      <li>So, if you&#x27;re not overly particular about the color, I would recommend Vinylux.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t forget the CND Vinylux clear topcoat!!</li>
      <li>The bottle looks light pink with some mother-of-pearl-like effect.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as pink as it looks in the picture and has a lovely sheer look.</li>
      <li>Its okay, but don&#x27;t notice anything different from any other nail polish.</li>
      <li>The polish lasts a much longer period than regular polish.</li>
      <li>I use this color, with &amp;#34;Romantique&amp;#34; and the color is soft.  </li>
      <li>It looks so natural with just a hit of shine.  </li>
      <li>Lasts 10+ days on my 22 yr old daughter&#x27;s nails though.</li>
      <li>Lasts much longer than regular polish, but still chips after a couple days for me.</li>
      <li>Today is only Monday - 2 days later - but nails still look freshly painted</li>
      <li>This looks like a light opaque pink, but it&#x27;s really sheer and very pale, just a hint of pink, like a natural healthy nail.</li>
      <li>I was not able to find pics on-line that accurately represent this nail color.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pretty color pink, but not opaque at all, as i had hoped.  </li>
      <li>Not totally foolproof, but let&#x27;s manicure stay &amp;#34;whole&amp;#34; for full week to week and a half.</li>
      <li>When you use it on your nails, it doesn&#x27;t really look pink, more of like a clear coat with a bit of sparkle (not big sparkles, just subtle ones).</li>
      <li>fast shipping, as expected</li>
      <li>Even with two coats, it&#x27;s still clear, but it does last a long time once on.</li>

<li> The CND Vinylux Beau # 103 Nail polish laquer is easy to apply,  last for at least a week, is hard and durable.</li>
<li> Sheer pink with a bit if frost.</li>
<li> Will definitely try some other colors.</li>

<li> It is sheer and a very pale pink.  </li>
<li> I will try some other colors.</li>
<li> Polish lasted all week and stayed shiny,but it did make my nails a little dry.</li>
<li> Of course it was no where near as tough as their gel nail products, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to be.  </li>
<li> Used the CND Sticky Base and the CND Top Coat.</li>
<li> The Vinylux Beau was slightly shimmery.  </li>
<li> You polish your nail and in less than 10 minutes you are out the door!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
<li> The color is a little sparkly.</li>
<li> I do know that she has been getting her nails done in this manner the past few months.</li>
<li> I get at least a week without chips</li>
<li> My disappointment was with the color.  </li>
<li> Too bad I didn&#x27;t see that before ordering.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> great product - will keep using it</li>
    <li> Color: Beau&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love this color - it is a semi-sheer soft pink so if you don&#x27;t like a transparent look, find a different color. It has a little bit of a frost but not enough to overpower.  It is my favorite of the pink shades from CND.  Proper nail prep makes all the difference.</li>
    <li> I actually got this as a gift for my daughter for Christmas.  She will have to let me know what she thinks of this product.  I do know that she has been getting her nails done in this manner the past few months.</li>
    <li> This is great.  It stays on for a week.  The color is not as pink as shown in the picture.</li>
    <li> This looks like a light opaque pink, but it&#x27;s really sheer and very pale, just a hint of pink, like a natural healthy nail. Check the CND website for notations that indicate sheer, shemi sheer and opaque. Too bad I didn&#x27;t see that before ordering. Staying power is good so I can&#x27;t complain about that. Just much lighter than I wanted.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty color pink, but not opaque at all, as i had hoped.  Even with two coats, it&#x27;s still clear, but it does last a long time once on.</li>
    <li> This polish goes on in a very sheer pale pink with just a hint of sparkle. Very pretty and natural. I could never get polish to last even a day without smudges, dents or chipping. I get at least a week without chips and I am a nurse so I wash my hands a lot. Hint: my manicurist wiped my nails with an alcohol wipe before applying this so I think that helps remove oils from the nails so it adheres better. I apply two coats and then the CND Vinylux topcoat and it is dry in 10 minutes. GREAT PRODUCT! I love being able to do my nails at home. I am going to branch out into darker colors now!</li>
    <li> fast shipping, as expected</li>
    <li> Great polish. Have to use their topcoat</li>
    <li> CND Vinylux is the best polish ever because it lasts so long and can be removed with regular remover.  I love this sheer pink color - it is translucent and looks beautiful.  Don&#x27;t forget the CND Vinylux clear topcoat!!</li>
    <li> Fast-drying nail polish and lasts 4-5 days for me with the Vinylux top coat. The color is a little sparkly.</li>
    <li> Fabulous color for a natural look. Sheer pink with a bit if frost. Love how quickly it dries. Lasts much longer than regular polish, but still chips after a couple days for me. Lasts 10+ days on my 22 yr old daughter&#x27;s nails though.</li>

    <li> it is a good product even if it doesn&#x27;t last a week as advertised.</li>
    <li> Like the product. However, color is very sheer.</li>
    <li> I love these products. You polish your nail and in less than 10 minutes you are out the door!&lt;br /&gt;This color Beau is a sheer translucent color that look like the colors of a &#x27;Bubble&#x27; effect.&lt;br /&gt;I actually used Cake Pop then Beau on top and it looks clean and natural.</li>
    <li> This polish is so light in color that it&#x27;s not even work putting on. A total waste of money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this polish, \\&quot;Beau\\&quot; because I used CND \\&quot;Beau\\&quot; gel polish and loved the color.  I didn&#x27;t expect them to have the identical staying power, so there was no disappointment there.  Vinylux Beau did last almost a week, provided I did very little with my hands.  The top coat secured it well.  Of course it was no where near as tough as their gel nail products, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to be.  My disappointment was with the color.  The gel color Beau was a beautiful pale pink; very natural.  The Vinylux Beau was slightly shimmery.  It did not have the same qualities of the other.  So, if you&#x27;re not overly particular about the color, I would recommend Vinylux.  If you&#x27;re trying to match a color (even with the same name) from CND&#x27;s gel nail products, I&#x27;d not bother.</li>
    <li> this polish is shimmery so you have to use 3 coats for light/medium coverage. it is very pretty and I have gotten lots of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it lasts 7-10 days!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am allergic to get at the salon so this is a perfect alternative! this polish lasts several days longer than OPI without chipping and losing shine.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product at a salon a year ago but the owner no longer carried it.Perfect color for me and lasts longer than previous brand.</li>
    <li> Vinylux is supposed to be one of the top lacquer nail polishes that wear for 7-10 days.  I bought several colors and used them as instructed but it did not last more than 2-3 days before chipping.  I will not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Super nail polish...wonder why it took so long to be available to the public.  The polish lasts a much longer period than regular polish.</li>
    <li> Did my nails Saturday night. Used the CND Sticky Base and the CND Top Coat. Today is only Monday - 2 days later - but nails still look freshly painted and I have washed lots of dishes and done tons of typing and piano playing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lacquer went on smoothly and evenly without any globbing. And this is from a person who is not the best &amp;#34;nail polisher&amp;#34; out there. The color is lighter than I was hoping and is more sheer than i thought it would.  Will definitely try some other colors.</li>
    <li> Love this new product.  Protects nails as well as shellac but doesn&#x27;t damage my nails and comes off with just a cotton ball and acetone.  Also doesn&#x27;t need to be cured with light.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after having it put on my nails in a salon.  It lasted for almost two weeks and I wash dishes by hand daily and also do gardening.  I like this color (Beau) even better than Romantique that was what I first had on my nails.  It is sheer and a very pale pink.  I was very pleased that I was able to do this myself at home.  It looks so natural with just a hit of shine.  I am coming back for more colors.</li>
    <li> CND is the greatest no chip polish.  I use this color, with &amp;#34;Romantique&amp;#34; and the color is soft.  Sure beats paying at the nail salon!</li>
    <li> great product and price</li>
    <li> The CND Vinylux Beau # 103 Nail polish laquer is easy to apply,  last for at least a week, is hard and durable.</li>
    <li> Polish lasted all week and stayed shiny,but it did make my nails a little dry. Came off easy with regular remover.</li>
    <li> I was not able to find pics on-line that accurately represent this nail color.  The bottle looks light pink with some mother-of-pearl-like effect.  When you use it on your nails, it doesn&#x27;t really look pink, more of like a clear coat with a bit of sparkle (not big sparkles, just subtle ones). Very cute and office appropriate.</li>
    <li> Its okay, but don&#x27;t notice anything different from any other nail polish.</li>
    <li> Fantstic, especially with the top coat, looks great and LASTS!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color. It&#x27;s not as pink as it looks in the picture and has a lovely sheer look. Perfect for enhancing your natural nail.</li>
    <li> Great find for my splitting nails. Not totally foolproof, but let&#x27;s manicure stay &amp;#34;whole&amp;#34; for full week to week and a half.</li>
    <li> I love this brand of polish! I love the colors and the fact that it lasts a long time without chipping! The top coat also helps it to dry really fast saving me lots of time!</li>
    <li> Goes on nicely but it requires many coats to achieve the color in the bottle. It does not chip. I will buy the product again but not this color.</li>
    <li> Did not last but two days</li>
    <li> The color has an illumination  to it.</li>
