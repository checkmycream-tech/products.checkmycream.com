      <li>This stuff is Awesome.  </li>
      <li>I guess word of mouth is the best advertising.</li>
      <li>Great product my skin looks bright and perfect...</li>
      <li>If it makes her happy, then I&#x27;m happy.</li>
      <li>Really great.</li>
      <li>but it helped a great deal.</li>
      <li>the texture and feeling is very nice.  </li>
      <li>Great service for this item and good value.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also fairly</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
      <li>and I love them!  </li>
      <li>Always love this!</li>
      <li>Not the kind that I like</li>
      <li>Now I am living in the States, and for the first time I used Shiseido, and I was so surprised and happy with how excellent this product is!  </li>
      <li>The Cosmetic Industry, I believe could do lots better than they do; I also think the retailers could do a lot better than they do.  </li>
      <li>With that said, this is probably the better product than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It never sits on top of the skin and never leaves a greasy film, not even in summer when my skin is oilier.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.</li>
      <li>but sure didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
      <li>and I can feel my skin to be more supple.</li>
      <li>I have been using Shiseido products for years - absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>Try it, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll like it as well.</li>
      <li>and I end up using more of it.</li>
      <li>love this stuff... always have..</li>
      <li>Was impressed by the positive reviews, but I got a skin rash using this product the first two times I tried using</li>
      <li>Very rich and moisturizing cream, just the way I need it!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who cares about his or her skin , it&#x27;s perfect, diminishes fine lines and wrinkles makes the facial tone even</li>
      <li>but I love how glowing &amp; smooth my skin looks/</li>
      <li>But I have used everything else from cheap to La Mer and this is by far the most superior.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and light on your face.  </li>
      <li>and this makes it smooth as silk.</li>
      <li>So far so good</li>
      <li>Something definitely works :o)</li>
      <li>It has a beautiful texture, it is never sticky and sinks in immediately.  </li>
      <li>compared to original one</li>
      <li>best lotion I have ever purchased, a little pricey but totally worth it.</li>
      <li>I think the Super Revitalizing cream felt silkier (but very moisturizing), and this one feels more dewy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I use it in the morning and night and it makes my face super hydrated.</li>
      <li>Lovely, soft fragrance, too!</li>
      <li>Wake up with soft, hydrated, glowing skin!  : )</li>
      <li>and this was the MOST moisturizing by far.</li>
      <li>This product is very misleading, although the bottle clearly says Advanced Super Resorting Cream, what I got was the Super Restoring Cream, which was discontinued about 2 years ago by Shiseido and replaced with the Advanced Super Restoring Cream shown in the picture, however, that is NOT the product I received.</li>
      <li>When I found it on Amazon I was thrilled - especially this was a bargain.</li>
      <li>This is good, but I have to put lots of other products on before to notice a difference.</li>
      <li>tried microderm roller on my face first, and this cream was absorbed like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;Happy</li>
      <li>I noticed my fine lines completely disappearing.</li>
      <li>I tried many products all winter long</li>
      <li>I think the cost for this product is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;However, I have been suffering from clogged pores more often--white heads, black heads-- since using this cream.</li>
      <li>and I really thought that was what I bought</li>
      <li>I will continue to use to see if it really does what the company claims.</li>
      <li>Very suspect.</li>
      <li>I use it at night because it is kind of heavy</li>
      <li>is similar to the Super Revitalizing cream, but thicker.</li>
      <li>What I got is their older formula.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d highly recomment it to anybody.</li>
      <li>This is NOT the new cream, which has the word &amp;#34;Advanced&amp;#34; on the container.</li>
      <li>theory is as this does have a fragrance to it, it may irritate sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My skin is hydrated and soft.</li>
      <li>As I get older I can not dry out my skin to keep it clear I need to keep it well balanced.</li>
      <li>and I will let you know if it is better or worse than the US one.  </li>

<li> .. lasts long time</li>
<li> cream lasts a long time, both on the face and in the jar.</li>
<li> this is not the real shiseido cream; it is extremely thick therefore, ot is any cream they put in the jar; I feel cheated&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I have dry skin</li>
<li> The cream in the bottle was a little short.</li>
<li> Everything as expected.</li>
<li> I use this at night because it is thick but does not breakout my sensitive skin.</li>
<li> Whenever I use this cream, it feels very similar to La Mer&#x27;s moisture cream but for half the price!</li>
<li> I ordered the Shiseido perfume from Amazon (a different vendor) and that came packaged as usual.</li>
<li> She also gets some of their other products.</li>
<li> .. has heavy fragrence but doesnt linger long.  </li>
<li> Bought as a gift for other and recipient likes it</li>
<li> I was using all foreign  products.  </li>
<li> It may be a little heavy for younger skin.</li>
<li> Like with all Shiseido products, I have never experienced any allergic reactions, despite having sensitive skin.  </li>
<li> slightly greasy feel on skin, takes along time to sink in</li>
<li> A little greasy</li>
<li> I am thinking it may be too heavy or oily for day and night use.</li>
<li> I have been using Shiseido products for a few years now</li>
<li> my humble opinion&lt;</li>
<li> However, I just received my order and the two boxes of lotion were not in the usual cellophane wrapper.</li>
<li> I am not sure if it is coffee grains I rub in my face, or this facecream.</li>
<li> This small container lasts for about 8 months.  </li>
<li> product was average, no better or worse than what you can buy in the drugstore for 1/2 the cost....</li>
<li> Please note that the product picture is wrong.</li>
<li> Once again, you cannot go wrong with a brand like Shiseido.</li>

    <li> product was average, no better or worse than what you can buy in the drugstore for 1/2 the cost....slightly greasy feel on skin, takes along time to sink in</li>
    <li> The Cosmetic Industry, I believe could do lots better than they do; I also think the retailers could do a lot better than they do.  This does have an expiration date and I am never sure if I get the product that is young enough to work.  This is good, but I have to put lots of other products on before to notice a difference. With that said, this is probably the better product than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s face different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just my humble opinion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JanSimpson</li>
    <li> Great product my skin looks bright and perfect...only thing i dont like is the scent...reminds me of &amp;#34;old-lady smell&amp;#34;! Beside it its great!!</li>
    <li> I have combination skin which gets drier in winter, and this cream is a life saver!  It has a beautiful texture, it is never sticky and sinks in immediately.  It never sits on top of the skin and never leaves a greasy film, not even in summer when my skin is oilier.  In winter  I use it twice a day: morning and evening.  In summer, I use it in the evening and skip the morning.  Like with all Shiseido products, I have never experienced any allergic reactions, despite having sensitive skin.  This cream is one of my beauty staples.</li>
    <li> While I was living in Japan, I had never used Shiseido products.  I was using all foreign  products.  Now I am living in the States, and for the first time I used Shiseido, and I was so surprised and happy with how excellent this product is!  I wish I had been using it before.  I&#x27;d highly recomment it to anybody.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who cares about his or her skin , it&#x27;s perfect, diminishes fine lines and wrinkles makes the facial tone even</li>
    <li> I love this product and would recommend it to everyone. My skin is hydrated and soft. I&#x27;m very pleased. Try it, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll like it as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several months. I use it along with Shiseido eye cream. I definitely got remarks about younger looking skin. I am not sure if it is coffee grains I rub in my face, or this facecream. Something definitely works :o)</li>
    <li> Once again, you cannot go wrong with a brand like Shiseido. This multi-tasking anti aging, firming, brightening, plumping &amp; moisturizing cream feels like velvet on your skin! I use it at night because it is kind of heavy but I love how glowing &amp; smooth my skin looks/feels in the morning. Yes, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This Shiseido Bioperformance is made in France, the one you buy in the department stores and from Shiseido on line is made in America.  This one seems thicker than the US brand and I will let you know if it is better or worse than the US one.  I can vouch for the US made one which I used for 2 months and had people ask me if I had had plastic surgery.</li>
    <li> I have been using Shiseido products for years - absolutely love it. When I found it on Amazon I was thrilled - especially this was a bargain. However, I just received my order and the two boxes of lotion were not in the usual cellophane wrapper. Both boxes were open. Very suspect. The lotion smells the same but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase from this vendor again. I ordered the Shiseido perfume from Amazon (a different vendor) and that came packaged as usual.</li>
    <li> This stuff is Awesome.  I have been using Shiseido products for a few years now and I love them!  This small container lasts for about 8 months.  I have dry skin and this makes it smooth as silk.</li>
    <li> like butter! best lotion I have ever purchased, a little pricey but totally worth it. My skin feels like silk after I use it and I can feel my skin to be more supple. customer for life!</li>
    <li> Not the kind that I like</li>
    <li> This product is very misleading, although the bottle clearly says Advanced Super Resorting Cream, what I got was the Super Restoring Cream, which was discontinued about 2 years ago by Shiseido and replaced with the Advanced Super Restoring Cream shown in the picture, however, that is NOT the product I received.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for other and recipient likes it</li>

    <li> Whenever I use this cream, it feels very similar to La Mer&#x27;s moisture cream but for half the price! I use it in the morning and night and it makes my face super hydrated.</li>
    <li> Always love this! It may be a little heavy for younger skin.</li>
    <li> Everything as expected.</li>
    <li> the texture and feeling is very nice.  I will continue to use to see if it really does what the company claims.</li>
    <li> love this stuff... always have.. absorbs well.. has heavy fragrence but doesnt linger long.  keeps skin supple.. lasts long time</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful face moisturizer. I use this at night because it is thick but does not breakout my sensitive skin. As I get older I can not dry out my skin to keep it clear I need to keep it well balanced. I do use a sunscreen moisturizer during the day and again this at night. So far so good and I will order this cream again.</li>
    <li> The wife Loves this product. I guess word of mouth is the best advertising. She either read about it or heard it from someone, like a friend. She tried it and has been buying it ever since. She also gets some of their other products. If it makes her happy, then I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Please note that the product picture is wrong. This is NOT the new cream, which has the word &amp;#34;Advanced&amp;#34; on the container. I received the product and it does not have the word &amp;#34;Advanced&amp;#34; on it. What I got is their older formula.</li>
    <li> Really great. I tried many products all winter long and this was the MOST moisturizing by far. A little greasy but it helped a great deal.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and light on your face.  Lovely, soft fragrance, too! Wake up with soft, hydrated, glowing skin!  : )</li>
    <li> Was impressed by the positive reviews, but I got a skin rash using this product the first two times I tried using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My theory is as this does have a fragrance to it, it may irritate sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also fairly thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May work for some but sure didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Very rich and moisturizing cream, just the way I need it!&lt;br /&gt;This is similar to the Super Revitalizing cream, but thicker. I think the Super Revitalizing cream felt silkier (but very moisturizing), and this one feels more dewy.&lt;br /&gt;I tried microderm roller on my face first, and this cream was absorbed like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;Happy face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;::UPDATE 6.6.2014::&lt;br /&gt;I have used this cream almost daily since purchasing and here are some thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;This cream lasts a long time, both on the face and in the jar. I have used cheaper creams before that are not as moisturizing and I end up using more of it. I think the cost for this product is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;However, I have been suffering from clogged pores more often--white heads, black heads-- since using this cream. I am thinking it may be too heavy or oily for day and night use. I am going to use it only at night after thorough face cleaning. Hopefully this will reduce the issue!</li>
    <li> I have really dry, parched skin in the winter and this is the only thing that saves me. I noticed my fine lines completely disappearing. I wear it morning and night. It makes my skin look youthful. Maybe because I have asian skin, this product works so well for me. I don&#x27;t know. But I have used everything else from cheap to La Mer and this is by far the most superior.</li>
    <li> Great service for this item and good value.  I will buy this item again.</li>
    <li> The cream in the bottle was a little short. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s suppose to be like that or not.</li>
