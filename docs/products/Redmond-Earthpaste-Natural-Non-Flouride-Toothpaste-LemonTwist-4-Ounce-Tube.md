      <li>and I find that to be a superior brushing experience.</li>
      <li>The flavor is good if you like lemon, I just prefer a minty flavor for brushing.</li>
      <li>I like this company, everything of theirs is good.  </li>
      <li>Tastes good though.  </li>
      <li>anyone know of a good Non-Flouride toothpaste?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Almost no aftertaste at all, which is good.</li>
      <li>The taste is good.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for homeopathic use as meant can get in the way of homeopathic uses.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Awesome! Tastes great, my kids love it they call it their lemon pie toothpaste. Exactly what we were looking for, all natural and effective! Definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> It cleans good, but I am use to a little bit of foaming action.  I seem to use more toothpaste when it doesn&#x27;t foam.  Other than that, I really like the lemon flavor and the great cleaning job it does.  If you don&#x27;t mind no foam it is a vey good tooth paste.</li>
    <li> We already enjoy Earthpaste in the Wintergreen and Peppermint flavors, but I was intrigued by the lemon flavor. My 2.5 year old loves it and so do I. We&#x27;ll be purchasing this flavor again.</li>
    <li> While I am happy with the product, it does a good job, I won&#x27;t order again.  I purchased three, at $1.93 each I was willing to take a chance, but was charged almost $17.00 for shipping. I don&#x27;t care how good the product is, the shipping is too much, and I won&#x27;t be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Ditching fluoride and this was recommended . She loves the taste and I don&#x27;t fret over her swallowing, Will be ordering more for myself and a friend</li>
    <li> Love the quality...taste and effectiveness of this all natural toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of this overall, even though I really wanted to like it.&lt;br /&gt;The Goods:&lt;br /&gt;• The flavor was decent and kids would probably like it (I only got this flavor since it happened to be on sale at the time :)&lt;br /&gt;• Ingredients seem to be healthy and beneficial&lt;br /&gt;• Decent price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Not-goods:&lt;br /&gt;• I wish it were thicker, the consistency is basically like pudding or chocolate mousse&lt;br /&gt;• Cleaned my teeth OK, but required a lot of product to make my teeth feel clean&lt;br /&gt;• Thin product makes it feel like you&#x27;re mostly brushing your teeth with your own spit&lt;br /&gt;• When you spit it out in the sink, it splatters brown everywhere due to how watery it becomes in your mouth. It makes quite a mess unless you basically put your face in the sink to spit closer to the drain&lt;br /&gt;• Cheesy packaging lingo refers to you as a &#x27;mudmouth&#x27;... this made me feel goofy for using the product. Subjective, though!&lt;br /&gt;• Tube didn&#x27;t last too long, since I felt the need to use more product to feel like it was abrasive enough to make my teeth feel smooth&lt;br /&gt;• Hole in the tube where the paste comes out is like half the size of normal toothpaste, which makes it a little harder to control where it goes on your brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I really wanted to like this product... the major thing that killed it for me was that it wasn&#x27;t thick enough so I didn&#x27;t feel like it was cleaning.</li>
    <li> my 10 year old loves this, i love this. its a great toothpaste. i use it in conjunction with activated charcoal and my mouth has never felt better.</li>
    <li> Finally a healthy toothpaste my son will use without complaint.  Love that is made from Redmond&#x27;s clay - no nasty stuff in this tube.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I know this is a little expensive, but this toothpaste tastes great, has no chemicals, and cleans really well.  You do have to get used to it not foaming, but I got used to it after about a week.  It does last the full two minutes for brushing...and even longer, if needed, and I only use a pea-sized amount.  It works well with a regular toothbrush and with my Braun electric toothbrush.  It leaves my mouth fresh.  It does not tingle or leave any unpleasant feeling.  The lemon taste to me is like lemon verbena.  5 stars!  Finally, a toothpaste that is good for you!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My children, ages 9m, 2y, 5y, and 7y all love the flavor, and I don&#x27;t feel bad about them swallowing it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s surely safe for kids, but tbut not that effective and the price is too high for just 4 ounce tube. Other products, like Tom&#x27;s, are more effective and safe as much. I&#x27;d rather stay with Tom&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this toothpaste. Great clean feeling, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about any chemicals in my family&#x27;s toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Great product... safe and good flavor. Kids love it.</li>
    <li> This has a refreshing taste, but I&#x27;m still stuck on regular tooth paste.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  It took no time to get used to this toothpaste.  The first brushing was interesting but after that I have no problem using it.  I love the lemon flavor.  I&#x27;m picky about mint flavors and reviewers seemed to like the lemon so I went for it.  I am trying to significantly reduce chemicals in everything I use and this was a great find.  My teeth do feel cleaner than ever but I have been flossing a lot better lately.  My back molars feel cleaner than they every have even with regular flossing.  I plan to update after a few months of use.</li>
    <li> I like this toothpaste, especially the lemon flavor, as it leaves such a clean feeling in my mouth. However, I don&#x27;t like the price and think it&#x27;s too expensive. I can make a similar toothpaste for a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> Contains lead.... enough said.....</li>
    <li> My 3 year old loves it :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using natural fluoride-free toothpastes for years now. I probably wouldn&#x27;t but Redmond Earthpaste ever again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not bad. I mean the flavor (Lemon twist) Is great. but the main problem is, I keep having to re-apply more because it doesn&#x27;t spread around well when Brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has no foaming agents, And neither do most of the other brands of natural toothpastes I&#x27;ve used such as BabyGanics, Jason, Branam, Trader Joes, Natures Gate, ETC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no problems spreading those around my teeth when brushing. But this Redmond earthpaste, I just having to apply it to my toothbush 2 or 3 times in one setting just to get a clean feeling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natural toothpastes are expensive as it is. I don&#x27;t see the tube I bought lasting more than 2 weeks</li>
    <li> I am (was) a huge fan of Crest Lemon Ice, and really missed it when it was discontinued.  I tried this, but should have listened to some of the negative reviews.  In short, it doesn&#x27;t foam at all, quickly dissolves into nothing, and is a tint of brown, so when you spit, it looks like you were brushing with dissolved mud.  If you are looking for something like Lemon Ice, this isn&#x27;t it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also sent an email to Crest asking them to bring Lemon Ice back.  They said they will consider it, with enough feedback.  They also sent me a coupon for $6 on any of their toothpastes.  Not bad for a 2 minute email to them.  Just go here: http://www.crest.com/contact-crest.aspx</li>
    <li> Delightful lemon flavor, much healthier than most other toothpastes, my children love it, but don&#x27;t look at the paste while you&#x27;re brushing! It is ugly! It doesn&#x27;t matter what it looks like really, and I&#x27;d MUCH rather than unattractive toothpaste that is healthy than lovely looking toothpaste that is filled with poison. I plan to continue buying it. But, I felt a warning was in order. The toothpaste is an awful greyish brown that resembles extruded mud on a toothbrush. As long as you can get past that, I recommend it!</li>
    <li> We use alot of Redmond clay products and this will get any kid to brush their teeth for two minutes!</li>
    <li> My first impression is that I don&#x27;t like it. I felt like I was brushing with lemon furniture polish. I much prefer the minty flavors. If I change my mind, I&#x27;ll let you know.&lt;br /&gt;Darn. I love lemon-flavored things - just not this.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this toothpaste, I honestly wouldn&#x27;t use any other kind now. It takes a little while to get used to if you&#x27;re switching from a toothpaste with a foaming agent in it</li>
    <li> tastes great. You can actually eat this junk!!! Tastes like fruits surprisingly. Only this does not clean very well. left light plaque residue on my teeth. I know it says for children on the bottle but we eat the exact same food; so whats good for the goose is good for the gander, right? Another problem is I will glob a HUGE blob on top of my tooth brush and it will disappear. The only thing I can compare it to is its like brushing your teeth with flavored water, there is no texture and it dissolves to quickly. But I got to say you should try it once. I can see this being a fun way of introducing you small children into brushing there teeth but nothing more.</li>
    <li> A great toothpaste.  This toothpaste line does NOT contain additives or harmful chemicals (like SLS - sodium laurel sulfate).  It is just pure and lightly flavored; it DOES the job and does it well.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. My teeth feel extremely clean.</li>
    <li> I need a no mint toothpaste which is hard to find.  The tube is hard to squeeze and comes out too little or too much.  The taste is good.  It&#x27;s a bit gritty so perhaps not for people use to &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpaste. I do the love the lemon part of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only giving this 3 stars because it was not horrible, but it definitely was not my favorite. It&#x27;s like brushing with strong lemon water. There is no foamy,  clean feeling when brushing. Seller and shipping were great though.</li>
    <li> Very clean, lemony taste that seems like it&#x27;s natural, not made in a lab.  Does not foam which has turned my child off of using it, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me and I will enjoy using it.</li>
    <li> This is a very taste alternative to regular toothpaste.  Its pricey but it lasts a long time.  It cleans very well</li>
    <li> I can see the positives with this product which is why I gave it a try. For me though, the fact it doesn&#x27;t foam just leaves me wanting. I went to another brand which doesn&#x27;t use flouride or other chemicals and it does foam. It has been way better than this. Taste was great but it seems to not be doing anything since it doesn&#x27;t foam or really stick. I am sure some folks love it and it works for them. That is why reviews are tough, some things work for some and others things for others. For a few bucks if you can swing it and care to try an alternative, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth a try, I just won&#x27;t be spending anymore on it, I could have loved it though, you never know.</li>
    <li> yum! It would make toothbrushing my 13 month old a pleasure if she didn&#x27;t bite down so hard on her finger-toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Bought this tooth paste because it says it good for children off all ages. Until you read the back of the package and it contains lead  and says can cause damage to reproductive organs and cause birth defects. I am also pregnant and will be returning this item and finding a safer alternative. I dug a little deeper and lead free america research said they have an obscene amount of lead in the tooth paste then what is considered safe to ingest. http://leadsafeamerica.org/earthpaste/</li>
    <li> Takes some getting used to if you&#x27;ve been using regular commercial toothpaste but overall I like the product and I will probably repurchase it</li>
    <li> great chem-free toothpaste, but it&#x27;s a little too dense</li>
    <li> Awesome toothpaste. No bad stuff and Tastes good. I&#x27;m not going back to Tom&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This is REAL toothpaste, not a foaming gel.  It cleans your teeth like the dentist does when they polish them after cleaning.  It is made of real materials from the west and has no bad affects to the interior of the mouth like some of the current chemical compounds that are presented as good for your teeth--but maybe not for your health.</li>
    <li> A very good toothpaste!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t feel like they got our teeth super clean!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best toothpaste you&#x27;ll ever try. It is 100% free of anything bad. Unlike most natural toothpastes, it doesn&#x27;t have that obnoxious meant, at least obnoxious to me. It&#x27;s good for homeopathic use as meant can get in the way of homeopathic uses. It feels great. Some people complain about the taste, and I don&#x27;t know why, the taste is fine. The whole point is that it&#x27;s not an overly sweetened chemically-ladened product that tastes like candy in your mouth, which to me is disgusting repulsive and revolting.</li>
    <li> I think this is the best toothpaste I have ever bought. It is healthy and clean tasting. I have bought this product for all my Grand children. And told all my friends about this great product!</li>
    <li> By far our favorite toothpaste!</li>
    <li> My daughter despises mint and it is very hard to find toothpaste that has no hint of mint - even the ones advertised as such.  This toothpaste however tastes like lemons and she loves it.  According to her &amp;#34;it looks gross&amp;#34; (it is brownish) but if you can get past that the toothpaste is wonderful.  It doesn&#x27;t foam like other toothpastes. I am thrilled to finally find a toothpaste that she won&#x27;t speed brush with trying to get out the mint flavor!</li>
    <li> Love the Lemon flavor of Earthpaste.  It isn&#x27;t at all what you would think it tasted like.  Wish my co-op carried this.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a natural toothpaste and this is the winner. I hate the mint or cinnamon aftertaste of toothpastes, so this is a great find. It works well and has a great, mild flavor.</li>
    <li> You have to use alot for your teeth to feel semi clean. I didnt feel like my teeth were clean. I wouldnt buy this again...</li>
    <li> Purchase this as a backup when Im not up for making my own so the kids have something quick to grab. It works great and the taste is fab! Love this stuff, you should still be a little careful with xylitol if you have pets especially don&#x27;t leave this tube lying around!</li>
    <li> I like the taste of this toothpaste and I like that it is all natural ingredients that don&#x27;t foam, but I felt like I had to use a lot of this product.  That may just be my conditioning from using conventional products, but I ended up adding coconut oil to the brush to really feel like my mouth was getting as clean as I would like.  For travel, this is definitely a keeper, but for everyday use I just mix up my own.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! The lemon taste is super mild and no it doesn&#x27;t foam but you totally get used to that. It cleans my teeth well and tastes great. I hate mint flavored anything, makes me nauseous.. this is so much better than Tom&#x27;s.  I&#x27;ll be ordering more very soon.</li>
    <li> Loved product much better than expected. Would recommend to anybody. Same for all ages. Two thumbs way up.  And it tastes great.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste looks weird. It works great! Tastes amazing and is ok to eat so I can share with my toddler! It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> This stuff even tastes good with a real lemon flavor.  I&#x27;ve never tried swallowing it after using it for a month, and I don&#x27;t think I ever will, but it sure seems to get my teeth feeling clean and fresh.  By the way, it&#x27;s supposedly safe to ingest because it&#x27;s made from only natural food ingredients and some clay so it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.  It also eliminated the sensitivity to hot and cold foods in one of my molars that has been bothering me for the past 3 months--something to do with remineralizing the protective enamel coating on my teeth from the natural salts in the paste I would guess.  When I run out of this stuff I&#x27;m going to order it again; it&#x27;s that good!</li>
    <li> Like taste and so far am happy with product.  Like natural and wanted to try something different. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flavor for my kids since I was concerned the four pack would have spicier flavored pastes. My son said it tasted the way that Lysol smells. I have to agree. It&#x27;s not my favorite. I do believe it does a good job of cleaning once you get used to the consistency of the paste.</li>
    <li> My kids use this and it seems to do the job.  I love that it does not contain fluoride.  The taste is just okay.  At times you can get a concentrated taste of lemon, which can be spicy.</li>
    <li> Great! My teeth just feel stronger than when I used other toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This is our first time to try the Lemon flavor and it is the best!  Out teeth feel so very clean</li>
    <li> This stuff has salt in it, which will make your teeth hurt if you&#x27;re starting to get cavities.&lt;br /&gt;I used this stuff for about 2weeks, and at first it seemed to be doing a great job. However after 2weeks I started to get pain in some of my lower molars, which I&#x27;ve never had before using normal fluoride toothpaste like Crest. I stopped using this stuff and after a few days the pain in my lower molars disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I urge people to do your research before picking up any toothpaste. Make sure and pay special attention to those ingredients! Just because it&#x27;s organic, does not mean that it can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t cause you more issues then the regular fluoride toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from my local health food store and I am SO happy I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me it has the right amount of lemon zestiness &amp; it really does make my mouth feel as clean as my mouth would feel after leaving the dentists office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like a whole lot, and why I keep buying it, is because it has a short list of ingredients and non of them are harmful if swallowed. In fact, the company actually recommends that you swallow it because some clays such as that which is in this tooth paste is actually good for you as it supports digestive health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: hydrated Redmond Clay and added Xylitol, essential oils, and Real Salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this again. I DO recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> My 2yr old luvs the flavor. There is trace amounts of lead so I decided to not use it as his only source of toothpaste. I switch on and off.</li>
    <li> My kids hate this tooth paste. I thought they must be crazy because I use the peppermint and adore it so I tried the lemon.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s disgusting. It&#x27;s like...really warm melted lemon candy with extra sugar or something. It&#x27;s way too sweet and artificial tasting. It left my mouth feeling sticky and gooey like I had too much candy even tho I was sure it was actually clean. I&#x27;m never buying this flavor again however earth paste is a great quality product and I&#x27;ll probably never switch brands.</li>
    <li> My kids love this...much better than they like other comparable toothpaste.  The flavor won them over.  Lemon is their favorite of the flavors.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to avoid flouride in the normal everday &amp;#34;recommended&amp;#34; toothpastes.  While this toothpast has a pleasant taste (yummy, actually), it doesn&#x27;t do ANYTHING for &amp;#34;morning breath&amp;#34; and my teeth feel &amp;#34;coated&amp;#34; all day as though I did not brush them.  I found myself going back and using the flouride-containing toothpaste I wanted to avoid!  I do hope there is a brand of flouride-free toothpaste that tastes good and freshens breath.  I did use a home-made mix a year ago and it DID work, but was messy.  Sorry, I just can&#x27;t recommend this brand.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for the lemon flavor. I use this in the morning and baking soda at night. I already use clay on my face and hair, so why not my teeth?</li>
    <li> I have been looking for an alternative toothpaste for my kids that was natural and didn&#x27;t have all those things I actually can&#x27;t pronounce or fully understand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hardest part being finding one they didn&#x27;t mind the taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, this one worked, they like the taste and I can get them to brush their teeth - hallelujah!</li>
    <li> Great product, but I couldn&#x27;t stand the taste and smell of the lemon - it reminds me of the smell of lemon pledge. I prefer the peppermint.</li>
    <li> Excellent healthy alternative to the numerous store brand toothpastes available. The lemon flavor is a hit with the whole family</li>
    <li> First toothpaste we used whwn we started brushing our son&#x27;s teeth. He&#x27;s 20 mos. old now and we&#x27;ve stuck with earthpaste. Specifically the lemon!</li>
    <li> I discovered that traditional toothpaste keeps your teeth coated with a film not allowing them to heal themselves. My son recommended this toothpaste and I will not go back to traditional.</li>
    <li> You know how you feel when you leave the dentist after a good cleaning?  This does it for you every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lemon is a very pleasant taste.  Very natural.  The lack of foaming to a bit of getting used to, as did thinking about scrubbing my teeth with dirt, but I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
    <li> Good, natural stuff. Fluoride-free. Foam-free LITERALLY. Even has an expiration date! Who could go wrong with a natural toothpaste that DOES NOT make you barf, when you reach too far back with your tooth brush? No one. :)</li>
    <li> I just wish that it had organic ingredients.  But it is the most natural toothpaste I can find on Amazon.</li>
    <li> My kids love this toothpaste. We&#x27;ve tried Dr. Sharp&#x27;s fluoride-free, SLS-free Strawberry Creme toothpaste. It was just ok. My kids took a while to get used to it. However, they all loved Lemon Twist toothpaste right away. We&#x27;ve been using it for a while now and just ordered more.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel so clean after using it. Its amazing since its made with clay. My little one likes it and that is a big compliment because I can&#x27;t get him to brush his teeth with anything else we have tried.</li>
    <li> After using store bought &#x27;natural&#x27; toothpastes and STILL not being happy with all of the ingredients, we finally heard about this brand! I tried making my own clay based toothpaste and it was yucky. This toothpaste is awesome! The kids love the lemon flavor, but all of the flavors are good. We&#x27;ve seen great improvements in our teeth.</li>
    <li> This is not supposed to be delicious anyway, but good for your teeth; so in that way it&#x27;s fine. The original flavor is more tolerable.</li>
    <li> I love natural toothpastes but am not a fan of this one.  The taste is bland and I really miss the fresh breath that I get from the xylitol toothpaste from NOW foods.  Love the minty after flavor, my mouth feels and is clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Redmond Earthpaste I will definitely not be re-ordering!  I wish that I had only ordered 1 tube.</li>
    <li> My kids love this toothpaste.  I have tried several &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; toothpastes and my kids always say &amp;#34;do we have to use the yucky toothpaste!&amp;#34;  But they don&#x27;t call this toothpaste &amp;#34;yucky&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> My husband is not a fan of the fact that it does not foam, but I have been using natural toothpaste for a while and I LOVE this!  I have tried making my own and I can&#x27;t seem to get the flavor and consistency right, but this is excellent and does not have any questionable ingredients.</li>
    <li> My son loves the lemon taste and I don&#x27;t have to worry about fluoride.  It is a paste but it&#x27;s brown.  Makes cleaning the sink a little harder because it&#x27;s so noticeable but totally worth it.  Kids don&#x27;t even have to rinse if they don&#x27;t want to or can&#x27;t.  Swallowing is not hazardous to their health.  And for the hard to convince crowd (fluoride is not essential to fight cavities):  We get good check ups regularly, no cavities so far after 2 years of use!</li>
    <li> Had to throw out this tube just about whole. Tasted and felt icky. Try Desert Essence Tea Tree Oil toothpaste instead.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste, no iffy ingredients and great flavor. All three of our kids love it and the our 2yr old will eat if straight from the tube if it&#x27;s left out.</li>
    <li> Liked the lemon flavor. Had trouble getting used to no bubbles/ foaming. Makes teeth feel really smooth. Almost no aftertaste at all, which is good.</li>
    <li> At first, my boys did not want to try this.  They had been using a gel paste that was blue and sparkly, and this tan mud was not appealing.  After a sniff though, both kids went for it, and it was a hit.  The taste is very mild - it smells like candy but tastes simple and clean.  It does not foam, and that has turned out to be a huge bonus.  My kids would not brush long enough because they hated a mouth of foam.  With this paste, my kids do a much better job (and they have much better morning breath!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another bonus - it comes very cleanly out of the tube.  My kids can squeeze it out the correct amount (rather than a huge glob) and put the top back on without extra toothpaste getting all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It costs a lot more than what we used to use, but since my kids have cleaner mouths and I have a cleaner bathroom, I will happily keep spending the extra money.</li>
    <li> I wish it had a lower rating on EWG Skin Database website, the cinnamon flavor is much lower but not always available.</li>
    <li> Leaves a nice lemony smell, my kids love that it isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; - they are not fans of mint pastes :-)</li>
    <li> OMG.  I am in love with this stuff!  It feels like after brushing that I just had my teeth professionally cleaned.  I have my 6 month cleaning this month and it will be interesting to see if the hygienist notices any difference when she does her job!  I love this. Taste is great, feels wonderful.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product from a company I feel I can trust!  I wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d like a toothpaste like this - it is unlike &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpastes (doesn&#x27;t foam, made of clay!, etc.) but I fell in love with this toothpaste from day one.  The lemon flavor is unique and actually refreshing.  I do feel like I need to use a little more than I&#x27;m used to to get my teeth clean, but it might just be sort of an overcompensation to getting used to the fact that it doesn&#x27;t foam up and fill your mouth.  Overall, I love this product and it is officially replacing my old toothpaste!</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste, however it is really pricey, kind of out of my price range. I&#x27;ll probably order it occasionally as if it were a treat.</li>
    <li> I am a permanent customer from now on. I started to use this and threw out my old toothpaste immediately! This is AWESOME!</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I wanted to try a more natural toothpaste. The taste was tolerable and it left my teeth feeling clean, but it did leave discoloration near the gum line which has not been easy to get rid of. This product is not for me.</li>
    <li> I have been buying tons of different organic toothpastes and Earthpaste is my favorite so far! I&#x27;ve tried their Lemon Twist &amp; Cinnamon flavors and the Lemon Twist is my favorite of those. My mouth is very sensitive and I have NO trouble with the lemon at all. Will be back for more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for more alternative toothpastes, so I tried this one out. It definitely is different from usual toothpastes, but I like it. The taste is very refreshing and has no aftertaste like normal toothpastes.</li>
    <li> I like this one.  It has a pleasant flavor that you can wake up to and cleans my teeth well.</li>
    <li> and that is saying a lot for her! We have gone through SOOO many different toothpaste for her because she does not like the sweet taste of children&#x27;s toothpaste.  Love it, it&#x27;s amazing, and she doesn&#x27;t have to spit it out! Will be keeping this in my cabinet for both of us, husband doesn&#x27;t like it, but then again he doesn&#x27;t like lemons.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this, with it being so hard to find a good, natural toothpaste without glycerin and all. The taste is amazing, like lemon pound cake. The texture is gross (doesn&#x27;t foam, gritty, hard to rinse off teeth, dries out your mouth and tongue very badly because of the clay) - but I could have gotten over all these things..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using for a few days my mouth hurt REALLY badly after using, and for hours after using it.. my teeth were very sensitive and my whole mouth seemed to ache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I stopped using it, the pain went away. I&#x27;m not sure why this is but I am very disappointed. I&#x27;m thinking it *might* have something to do with my silver fillings - some things I&#x27;ve read online say clay based toothpaste is fine to use, and other sites say it&#x27;s an absolute no-no (for fillings). So if you have silver fillings, maybe reconsider trying this out.</li>
    <li> We have wintergreen and we love it. My son wanted to try the lemon(he&#x27;s 3) but ended up liking the wintergreen much better. The flavor is good if you like lemon, I just prefer a minty flavor for brushing.</li>
    <li> Like others have stated, it takes some getting used to my mouth not foaming up, but the texture is actually pleasant. I am finding it hard to understand another reviewer calling it bland. It tastes very much like a sweet lemon meringue pie, just not overly sweet. This paste actually leaves my mouth feeling clean without wanting to gag or my eyes water from all the mint. The spit resembling mud can be somewhat off-putting at first lol I will continue to purchase, and if I have need, use a natural mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Everyone in the family ages 4-36 loves thus toothpaste. Leaves your teeth feeling clean and it&#x27;s nice to know my kids aren&#x27;t raking in unnecessary chemicals</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste.  I hate the normal minty tastes from toothpaste, and the lemon flavor is perfect for me.  There&#x27;s no froth from this paste, which I&#x27;m just fine with.  My teeth do feel cleaner than normal, especially the backs of my teeth, which I&#x27;m really picky about.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t like foam in your mouth, then this is the toothpaste for you.&lt;br /&gt;I love this toothpaste, natural, non-harmful to the body, and I have had&lt;br /&gt;great check-ups at the dentist. Lemon is my favorite choice.</li>
    <li> To little lemon flavor too much dirt taste</li>
    <li> I always buy this natural toothpaste as I don&#x27;t agree that our bodies can process all the chemicals that we introduce. Great taste, fast shipping, awesome product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m enjoying this new toothpaste. I like that it contains all natural ingredients. I had assumed the salt was there as an abrasive, but this toothpaste is very mild feeling, The lemon twist tastes great and leaves your mouthy feeling fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> just a great thing, love it, LOVE IT. Probably the most &amp;#34; cleanest&amp;#34; from chem toxins and etc.  paste on the market as of today. One suggestion to manufacturer - make it in more flavors. Something &amp;#34;tropical taste&amp;#34; would be great.</li>
    <li> I have been using the cinnamon and tried the lemon. It actually has lemon, lime and tangerine EO&#x27;s in it so it tastes like Fruit Loops. My teeth feel amazingly clean and are whiter. All clay can be drying so u may want to switch it up or mix it with coconut oil if u have bad breath or tonsil stones</li>
    <li> My wife wanted a healthy alternative for the kids.  They love the taste and we don&#x27;t have to worry about all the chemicals in our kids toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Didnt seem expensive til it actually charged 17.00 to ship.  Not worth it and didnt seem to work well alone.  Baking powder worked better.  Add some lemon oil of essence in coconut oil and baking powder..  My favorite.  Orange oil good too.</li>
    <li> No SLS or other junk, amazing natural product with NO FLUORIDE ! Fluoride has been declared a neurotoxin actually, google it!</li>
    <li> It seems as though the quality is not&lt;br /&gt;there.  It is a bit thin and if you are&lt;br /&gt;not careful it will fall of the toothbrush.</li>
    <li> We on&#x27;t be using anything else!&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste does everything without the chemicals and dangers of other toothpaste. My children and I all have bright smiles and healthy gums. We love the taste too.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love Earthpaste, it makes your teeth feel like you just had a dental cleaning with regular use.  The lemon flavor is a nice change!</li>
    <li> My son hates the harsh mint of regular toothpaste. With the lemon flavor he says it is good enough to eat. He now actually brushes his teeth without a great deal of complaints.</li>
    <li> My favorite flavor, Lemon, is out of this world. My whole family loves Earthpaste... it rinses away so cleanly! And it&#x27;s even safe to swallow if by accident or on purpose, lol. And has no lingering feeling except fresh and clean. I can&#x27;t say enough good about this product.</li>
    <li> I had to use more than the usual pea size amount because it is thin like it was watered down.  It tasted good but It didn&#x27;t have enough abrasion to make my teeth feel clean.  I have Lichen Planus (sore in my mouth from immune condition) and this did not burn or irritate anything which is great news.  I am going back to &amp;#34;Neem&amp;#34; toothpaste.  I was just looking for something different.  This is a good product with natural ingredients but just not abrasive enough.  I have a friend that loves it though.</li>
    <li> I TRIED to love this organic toothpaste but its not for me....It did make my gums bleed a lot..I guess from the salt..I also had to use alot because it kept falling off of my toothbrush.It didn&#x27;t last that long for the price...my teeth did feel clean after I used it though...my husband was a trooper and tried it for awhile but he took the walk of shame and went back to the old stuff...sadly I have too..well I&#x27;m on the hunt for another good organic toothpaste.</li>
    <li> We love earthpaste!!! The Lemon Twist earthpaste is my personal favorite!!</li>
    <li> Love it, but it&#x27;s too expensive to keep buying.  There&#x27;s a recipe to make it, which I will try.</li>
    <li> This paste has a mild lemon taste. It&#x27;s a little hard to get used to not having a foaming toothpaste but my kids don&#x27;t mind ( they are 7,4, and 4.)</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a fluoride free toothpaste for my 6 yr. old for a while to no avail.  There are none to be had in the stores other than Tom&#x27;s strawberry which she doesn&#x27;t like (my 3 yr. old does though) or toddler toothpaste.  I found two other brands on here that had not great reviews (one was said to taste like soap and one was accused of having mold) so I decided to give this one a try.  Not thrilled with the price (with shipping) but my daughter likes it and it doesn&#x27;t contain fluoride, artificial sweeteners and dyes so I&#x27;m happy so far.  I&#x27;ll probably start making my own though as $7 on toothpaste is a bit steep.</li>
    <li> like the taste and great for my kids</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s difficult to say if it worked or not. It tasted fine and has nothing artificial and no chemicals. But the paste clogged our sink.</li>
    <li> Actually bought this for my boyfriend who rather not brush his teeth than use most of the tooth paste on the market. He loves this stuff, I&#x27;ve used it a few Times and I enjoy it also.</li>
    <li> After reading up on all the junk that is in the average toothpaste, even the Xylitol gels I was using for myself and my daughter, I felt the need to find a toothpaste that wasn&#x27;t full of weird chemicals and questionable ingredients. A friend suggested Earthpaste, and I chose the lemon twist flavor since my toddler doesn&#x27;t like minty flavors. It&#x27;s a pleasant flavor with the added bonus of never causing weird tastes in your mouth. Have you ever had a drink of orange juice after brushing your teeth with regular toothpaste? That&#x27;s not a concern with this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;The texture does take some getting used to when you are used to toothpastes full of foaming agents like Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, which actually causes me to develop canker sores. This wasn&#x27;t really an issue for me since I was using non foaming Xylitol gel prior to Earthpaste. You may not get the &amp;#34;clean feeling&amp;#34; you get with mainstream toothpaste, but this really does clean your mouth! I had a dental cleaning yesterday and for the first time had zero scaling buildup on my teeth, which really surprised my dentist. I attribute that to using Earthpaste and oil pulling with coconut oil daily. This toothpaste is great for anyone who wants to avoid fluoride and is conscious of the materials they put in their body. Additionally, this lemon twist flavor is really great for kids.</li>
    <li> Leaves teeth mouth and gums pretty celan and fresh, though a little bland, and a little more breath support might be nice</li>
    <li> the kids like it, they like the flavor the color and that they did not need a lot on their tooth brush.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a toothpaste without fluoride, and I liked that this doesn&#x27;t have glycerin and stays really basic with the ingredients. I decided to try it. While it does clean okay, it felt like a residue of some sort was still being left on my teeth. Even when I stored the tube upright the way they suggested, it had a tendency to &amp;#34;burp&amp;#34; and spurt toothpaste over the sink when I was trying to put a some on my toothbrush. After about a week, I figured out how to avoid that problem, but my teeth started getting sensitive for the first time in my life. I know people have said here that this toothpaste worked great to get rid of their teeth sensitivity, but it worked the opposite way for me. I quit using the toothpaste for a while and my problem went away. I used the toothpaste again, and after about a week, my teeth got really sensitive again. So now I can&#x27;t use this nearly-full tube.</li>
    <li> I liked how clean and bright this made my teeth, but unfortunately, I&#x27;m allergic to the xylitol, so I can&#x27;t use this product.</li>
    <li> Lemon flavor is an unexpected delight. Seems to clean well.</li>
    <li> Okay, this seems to be a good toothpaste, but there are a few things you need to get past. The taste is different than regular paste, it&#x27;s good, just different. It doesn&#x27;t foam in your mouth, but that turns out is a good thing. And lastly, when you spit in the sink, it&#x27;s brown and looks like mud. Here&#x27;s my two cents: this stuff is good for you, just brush your teeth and don&#x27;t worry about the differences.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this toothpaste do not have soap in it.&lt;br /&gt;I feel my teeth real clean, my sister in-law is switching to this too !!!</li>
    <li> I wasnted to buy a Non-Fluoride toothpaste but this is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients says it contains trace amounts of lead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone know of a good Non-Flouride toothpaste?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not trust Tom&#x27;s of Maine I read there paste conatins aluminum.</li>
    <li> I used to use Toms of Maine before they sold out and started putting chemicals in their toothpaste. Earthpaste is awesome, my 5 year old son loves the taste. Since there are no chemicals to fill your mouth with bubbles he thinks he needs to use more, so I just make sure he doesn&#x27;t use too much.</li>
    <li> Natural and simple with a funny package!! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Should we not be more concerned about the level of aluminum in this product?  I went to earthpaste website and viewed the elemental anaysis of their clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lead, which many have been concerned about, is only 11.9 parts per million, whereas aluminum is 77,500 ppm.  I don&#x27;t know much about what levels are considered to be safe, but this looks quite high to me...  should we be concerned???</li>
    <li> We switched to EarthPaste a few months back, and our kids had a hard time &amp;#34;liking&amp;#34; it. They were used to the kids ones that tasted like strawberry. I decided to buy the lemon, and they LOVE it! No more fussing to brush teeth. This tastes just like the lemon head candy. :)</li>
    <li> Very natural toothpaste that has a great flavor. I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to clean up the products I use daily and hadn&#x27;t really considered what was in my toothpaste until I self-diagnosed myself with perioral dermatitis. I won&#x27;t bore you with the details about it, but one of the things that is thought to cause, or at least irritate it, is fluoride and SLS in toothpastes. I never realized how difficult it was to find a toothpaste without these two items, geesh! Some toothpastes won&#x27;t have &amp;#34;SLS&amp;#34; but they&#x27;ll have another version of it with a slightly different name. Nice try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a ton of research looking for natural toothpastes and finally decided on Redmond because I could get it off Amazon and at an okay price if I did it as an add-on. I am normally a little sensitive to citrus flavors and realized this after ordering. However, I have had no reactions to this toothpaste and it is not on overpowering flavor. It is just a nice, refreshing lemon flavor and I find it pleasant to use. I agree with another reviewer that I do feel like I have to use more, but that could also be because I&#x27;m used to using a ton anyways to get that foaming sensation. This toothpaste does NOT foam and takes getting used to simply because of that. All in all, I&#x27;m definitely going to make this my toothpaste of choice and try out the other flavors. If you have perioral dermatitis, or you simply just want to switch to a natural toothpaste, I would highly recommend this brand.</li>
    <li> Its for kids and not mentioned on the product description that its for them. What a waste of money. I wanted money back. However gave up as a contribution. Toothpaste staying in the bathroom forever.</li>
    <li> This is what my 6 yr old twins had to say about lemon earthpaste:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s yummy and doesn&#x27;t have weird, scary ingredients. You can swallow it! It tastes good and doesn&#x27;t make food taste weird if you brush your teeth before breakfast. I like to brush my teeth more times now. You can make shapes with this if your mom lets you. We made stars and polka-dots in the sink. She didn&#x27;t mind. Then we brushed our teeth again.</li>
    <li> A relative went through radiation and chemotherapy. During the treatment he developed lots of sores/sensitivity in his mouth. For him, mint toothpaste was torture. And it is apparently very difficult to find toothpaste without any mint. I found this toothpaste. He was very pleased with the performance.</li>
    <li> Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Tastes fine for the duration of brushing.&lt;br /&gt;No after taste.</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy a natural toothpaste but was disappointed with the product.  It&#x27;s indeed a paste, the product ends up falling off my toothbrush and into the sink.  You&#x27;re better off making your own paste with baking soda!</li>
    <li> Our entire family loves this toothpaste.  My eight year old is extremely picky about toothpaste and she loves Earthpaste Lemon Twist. I don&#x27;t think she will brush with anything else at this point.  We have noticed that it really does a good job removing extrinsic stains.  It leaves teeth shiny and smooth and gums healthy.  One thing to know about this toothpaste is that it does not foam up.  It is something to get use to but this is what we want right? I do not want the foaming agents in my toothpaste.  Once you get use to the difference you will love this!</li>
    <li> love this stuff. safe to eat and works well. my favorite natural toothpaste by far!</li>
    <li> My daughter just loves the lemon flavor- so much so that she tries to suck it off the brush before her teeth are clean lol! My husband said her teeth look whiter and we&#x27;ve only been using it for about a month.</li>
    <li> Tastes great and leaves teeth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> LOVE this toothpaste! It&#x27;s the only kind that gets my teeth (and my childrens) completely clean!  Not to mention it&#x27;s free of toxins.  Happy momma!</li>
    <li> Taste tacky, no clean feeling, for kids, misleading marketing, thrown in trash after 2 uses.</li>
    <li> Love the taste and feel of this toothpaste. It cleans great with none of that annoying foaming of most toothpastes. And if your in a hurry and brushing on the go? No worries. It is completely edible so you can brush in your car and rinse by drinking some water.</li>
    <li> It has a very nice taste.  I can&#x27;t know if it helps reduce cavities, of course.</li>
    <li> Warning on bottle and box says that the clay used in this toothpaste contains &#x27;trace amounts of lead&#x27; and could be harmful to children and pregnant women. So why do they say that this toothpaste&#x27;s ingredients are completely harmless on this product listing?!&lt;br /&gt;I was so pleased with the reviews I perused, that I was SHOCKED to see this warning. In fact I was happily glancing over said bottle as I was ripping off the seal to set this upstairs for my children to use tonight when I noticed said warning. Of course within the packaging came a label that one could not return any opened bottles... well mine when promptly tossed in the trash after stopping to take a picture to upload for this review. Take a look at it yourself so you can make an informed decision before you make the same mistake I did and throw your money in the garbage.</li>
    <li> Smooth thin paste, Needs more lemon it&#x27;s kind of plain</li>
    <li> My children find the peppermint Earthpaste a bit much, so I ordered the Lemon Twist. They love it, and no longer complain about having to brush. I love that it has no flouride and is made of all beneficial, healthy ingredients.</li>
    <li> this paste taste amazing and lingers for awhile after brushing. makes teeth feel clean. it doesn&#x27;t fizz which is nice.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this toothpaste is so natural, but the thing I love the most is the flavor!  I have never been a person who enjoyed the taste of mint or cinnamon, so it&#x27;s very refreshing to have a lemon-flavored toothpaste!  Be prepared for NO sudsing, but please know that foam is not required for cleaning your teeth...it&#x27;s purely aesthetic.  The paste is a grayish brown color, and gets the job done beautifully.  I will say, however, that you may want to use a mouthwash after brushing for the sake of fresh breath.  But as far as cleaning your teeth goes, I love this toothpaste!  I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste may just require some time to get used to it. It tastes good - like lemonade, but doesn&#x27;t foam at all, rather like using mud to clean your teeth. Not sure how effective it may be.</li>
    <li> The best toothpaste my family has ever used. We will never go back to store-bought brands again. My husband and I have noticed a significant difference in the whiteness of our teeth. I used to use Sensodyne to try to help with my extreme sensitivity, but it never worked - one week of using Earthpaste and my sensitivity is completely gone. My 3 1/2 year old son LOVES this toothpaste and the best part is that I don&#x27;t have to worry about him swallowing it. This stuff is completely natural and tastes amazing, too.</li>
    <li> It is safe enough for me while Im pregnant and for my five year old to use. Its not the best taste, but bearable, it is not gritty!</li>
    <li> Our kids don&#x27;t like it...and I bought it for them because the dislike mint and cinnamon. Husband likes it so that&#x27;s a save. I&#x27;d like to try the mint.</li>
    <li> I really hoped this toothpaste would be great, and it is in some ways. I love the taste of the Redmond Lemon Twist Earthpaste Toothpaste, I love that it&#x27;s okay to swallow and safe for kids, but it doesn&#x27;t freshen our breath at all – even when using mouthwash first. The toothpaste leaves my mouth with a definite clean feeling and my teeth haven&#x27;t felt as sensitive since I started using it, but it would be nice if I didn&#x27;t have to use a second toothpaste to freshen my breath after using this. We use this one before bed and use the Redmond Spearmint Earthpaste Toothpaste in the morning for funk-free freshness.</li>
    <li> I have yet to find a toothpaste with better ingredients. Don&#x27;t worry about lead content, as organic produce has a higher amount!&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re not going to find a safer, healthier toothpaste. Great taste, as well!</li>
    <li> The color and lack of flouride keep me away from using this.</li>
    <li> 18 month and 5 year old love this paste. Zero fluoride. We love this brand and trust it.</li>
    <li> I like this company, everything of theirs is good.  Do try their Redmond Salt too.  It&#x27;s terrific.</li>
    <li> Good smell, kids love it, works well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes comes out of tube messily, but really not a big issue for us</li>
    <li> Love it! So clean feeling!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 4 year old son, because he still has issues with swallowing toothpaste and he hates mint and cinnamon and oddly enough the bubble gum flavored toothpastes. He likes it, and his father also likes it, as he hates the taste of mint. :D And he prefers the lemon to the cinnamon earthpaste that I bought at the same time for HIM! *L*</li>
    <li> I am so glad to find toothpaste which does not contain chemicals. Very pleasant taste and leaves mouth feeling clean.</li>
    <li> love that we know and can pronounce all the ingredients! the best, real, natural toothpaste out there! more cost effective than lots of the homemade diy versions!</li>
    <li> My kids love the taste of this and I love that it cleans their teeth without the questionable ingredients in other toothpastes.</li>
    <li> Does not freshen your breath or have a lasting flavor</li>
    <li> This is all my wife will use now.  And as soon as what I&#x27;m using is gone,  she&#x27;s already stocked up on it for me too.</li>
    <li> The taste is o.k. - lemon twist -  but just clumps up my electric toothbrush - had to toss it.</li>
    <li> Love this Earthpaste. And lemon is my favorite! My teeth feel great when I use it and I feel less junk is being put in my system. Makes me happy. Lemon really makes me happy!</li>
    <li> Awesome toothpaste!!!</li>
    <li> I really love this toothpaste because my teeth feel very clean after brushing and the lemon twist flavor is refreshing and tastes great to me.  I often swallow instead of spiting  out and this is safe to do with this toothpaste.  It doesn&#x27;t foam and I like that too.  However, some people who I have let try my toothpaste because I think it is great don&#x27;t like it for that very reason. So this toothpaste will not be liked by everyone.</li>
    <li> Tastes great! Thanks for a healthy way to take care of my teeth</li>
    <li> We discovered Earthpaste a few months back and have been using it ever since.  My husband and son both love it as much as I do, but the peppermint flavor was only ok.  The cinnamon has been a big hit, but for my husband and 4 year old the lemon has been a HUGE hit!  They love this flavor and now use it exclusively.  I love the way it cleans our teeth with no nasty stuff.  All of our teeth have whitened significantly since we began using Earthpaste and I can feel former tarter buildup that even the dentist couldn&#x27;t get off slowly eroding away from my teeth.  My teeth look and feel healthy, white and strong.  I&#x27;ve also noticed the sensitivity to cold foods that I was beginning to have before I switched is completely gone.  I get tons of compliments on my teeth from my co-workers now and constantly asked what I do to get them so white. (Of course, I get lots of funny looks when I answer I brush with clay.) At my last dental checkup the dentist also commented on how white my teeth were, how she didn&#x27;t need to do any tarter removal and how healthy my gums looked. I do wish the product was a little less expensive, but for our dental health I am willing to pay it.</li>
    <li> both kids and parents love it</li>
    <li> The reviews I saw online for this product were all positive, so I decided to order a tube of my own. Not only did it ship fast, it got here EARLIER than expected! I was so excited to try this one (I have the Wintergreen already) and I am not disappointed. :D It tastes similar to lemonheads candy, and the aftertaste reminds me of the lemon loops in Fruit Loops cereal! Very fresh and tasty... I find myself wanting to add more and more paste as I&#x27;m brushing because I can&#x27;t get enough of it! If you LOVE lemons, you&#x27;ll fall in love with this stuff, for sure.</li>
    <li> Taste great! Teeth feel extra clean after brushing.</li>
    <li> my two year old son and I love the taste and it seems to be effective in cleaning. I usually use just baking soda so it&#x27;s nice to switch it up and use something with flavor. Few ingredients that I trust, great taste that isn&#x27;t too strong but pleasant and effective in cleaning. I&#x27;m satisfied!</li>
    <li> tastes great but splats everywhere when squeezing out plus puts brown all over your sink. also contains lead and dries out your mouth. tried to get refunded and refused.</li>
    <li> Horrible! Suddenly turns to liquid, feels horrible, smells bad, and the after taste tastes like crap in your mouth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste over 3 months.  My dental check up showed some improved deep pockets.  The toothpaste doesn&#x27;t whiten like Closys products but it healed sore gum and strengthen it.  I feel good knowing if my son swallow it, it&#x27;s safe.  The ingredients are hard to beat if you&#x27;re trying to go toward natural products.  I applied it to my gum when it&#x27;s acting up and it seems to help calm the soreness.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste for folks who don&#x27;t like mint&lt;br /&gt;Wish it was much more lemony still&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to ordered</li>
    <li> At first it was weird I&#x27;m not going to lie! But, now I love it! The essential oils irritate my mouth a bit but nothing crazy. If you have garlic or something very spicesd up,  it won&#x27;t really give you super fresh breath like conventional toothpaste does. It has whitened my teeth a bit and they do feel cleaner!</li>
    <li> Quick service and excellent quality of the item i received!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m having a bit of trouble with this-- I LOVE the concept and the idea. I&#x27;m into natural hygiene care but I don&#x27;t love making my own products. Earthpaste has done the work for me, but I&#x27;m having trouble getting used to it. The taste is great and the texture of the paste is fine. My issues is that I feel like I have to use SO much of it to get my teeth clean. Since it doesn&#x27;t foam, I&#x27;m overcompensating by continuing to add more and more toothpaste onto my brush. There&#x27;s no way I can brush for a full two minutes with this paste. I will continue to try this product as it is the leader in eco-friendly, natural toothpaste, but it has been a difficult adjustment.</li>
    <li> Tastes great!  Refreshing!  Why isn&#x27;t it sold in stores?  I will always buy this.</li>
    <li> Horrendous taste, my girl wouldn&#x27;t touch it.</li>
    <li> best toothpaste on the market for kids, period</li>
    <li> I love the taste in my mouth during brushing, very lemony. Not much foam though like regular toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Everything like described by the seller and more. More because after second brushing teeth my teeth were white like after whitening. I had some yellow stains after coffee and i dont use any whitening strips anymore because had large pain. With this toothpaste i don&#x27;t have to use whitening. And my teeth are cleaner the after whitening. First paste when you can feel chalk - chalk most important for clean.&lt;br /&gt;BUT ..&lt;br /&gt;This paste doesn&#x27;t have nothing so my one time bruching is two times. One with this paste and second with other with amine fluoride for example elmex or biotene enzyme.&lt;br /&gt;Both together are killer for breath, clean, fresh filling where i had huge problem even after brushing 5 times a day with othe toothpaste. Now i can talk and smile :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its better in taste then wintergreen but now wintergreen isnt that bed like first time for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also when i saind about this paste to my family ( no foam, coloring, taste, natural, ) they want to buy it. Because now we living in chemicals, we east chemicals and we are like chemicals so we looking for something natural or less chemicals, agents etc. then other item.</li>
    <li> good product.  The texture is weird at first, but its a good quality toothpaste and I trust is has ingredients that are actually good for your teeth.... what a concept.  ( :</li>
    <li> So far, this product has been great. It doesn&#x27;t foam or anything, which I am used to with &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpaste, but I&#x27;m perfectly okay with that. My teeth are still white, because you really don&#x27;t need all those harmful extra ingredients to whiten teeth. Overall, I have nothing negative to say, personally, about this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. The lemon flavor is a lifesaver. My 3 year thinks anything minty is &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; so this was a wonderful alternative. Gets her teeth clean &amp; smelling fresh without being &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I love the fresh lemon taste and my four year old and one year old love this toothpaste too!  My four year old refuses to spit out toothpaste so I feel more comfortable using this paste versus one with Fluoride and Chemicals.  Great product and looking forward to our next dentist appointment to see how it does according to her standards.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a more natural product with a taste my kids liked. They love the taste and it works great!</li>
    <li> I found a few companies whom make a toothpaste without glycerin and artificial coloring, forming agent, fluoride etc.  I hate to pay for the garbage, but am willing to pay for organic/real wild crafted stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Just a toothpaste, but goes into my mouth and teeth that has to be chosen as less garbage as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste is one of the favorite flavors and best !!</li>
    <li> All three of my VERY picky eaters/ tasters are very happy with this paste. I did explain to them that it&#x27;s different then the more \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; toothpaste (eg: no foaming or bright red and blue colors). They love the lemon flavor. I recommended trying this brand!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know it was kids paste and stuff.  Tastes good though.  Stuff.  I like to fart.  I hope no one farted on my toothbrush.</li>
    <li> After studying the best homemade alternatives to standard toothpaste, and trying several recipes, I found this toothpaste and am very satisfied with it.  My favorite is the lemon twist version.  You might think -- eww, clay!? -- but it is very smoothly incorporated into the toothpaste.  SIde-by-side with a tube of conventional toothpaste, this is clearly a more healthy alternative and of substantial consistency.  Leaves no aftertaste.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love my new, all natural toothepaste in this lemon flavor!  Thanks!  I plan on buying more when I run out!</li>
    <li> The lemon taste/scent is subtle but delicious, and it is not hard to get used to the texture. In fact, I had to use regular toothpaste when I was traveling and and the crazy foaming really threw me off. I love Earthpaste and wish they had travel sizes so that I never have to go back to normal toothpaste again!</li>
    <li> My teeth became discolored and extremely sensitive, unfortunately so did my daughters and her eight year old son&#x27;s gums started bleeding right away. I had such high hopes because of all the natural ingredients and there are so many  good reviews but this stuff is dangerous for some.</li>
    <li> I realize this is not for everyone because of the non-foaming factor, but I like it and so does my easy to please (toothpaste-wise) kid. The flavor is just okay, I&#x27;ll try something minty next time.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste--the flavor is good and my mouth feels fresh.</li>
    <li> My kids are ridiculously picky about how toothpaste tastes. I am picky about the ingredients. Both kids like the taste and I&#x27;m happy with the ingredients. WIll be purchasing again for sure!</li>
    <li> My picky kids both liked this lemon toothpaste.  It doesn&#x27;t foam up but it works great!  It left our mouths feeling really good!!  My son is ok with Tom&#x27;s strawberry fluoride free but I was looking for something he and my daughter would both enjoy.</li>
    <li> My kids love the taste of the Lemon Earthpaste. It seems to clean their teeth really well and I love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about them swallowing it.</li>
    <li> Upon receiving this product, I was quite outraged, when on the tube itself; it clearly states, \\&quot;for kids of all ages.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, at the back of the box on the very bottom; in small print, there is a WARNING that states this product cannot be sold to anyone in the state of California because of the banned on LEAD this product contains. What&#x27;s even more upsetting is, they even warn against pregnant women or children consuming this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the exact warning:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warnings&lt;br /&gt;[California Residents Proposition 65] Warning: This product contains trace amounts of lead, a substance known to the State of California to cause birth defects or reproductive harm. This product may not be appropriate for consumption by children or pregnant women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Redmond, in their own words, say it themselves; yet on the front of their packaging they claim, it is safe for kids of all ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disgusted they claim their earthpaste is an all natural product; which in essence mean they&#x27;re only deceiving their consumers with &#x27;marketing tactics&#x27; they know the consumer wants to hear such as: no fluoride, glycerin and it&#x27;s safe to eat. If this claim is true then why does this product contain, lead? This is misleading to their consumers and to the general public and I, for one will not support such falsified and manipulative marketing gimmicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  am spreading the word, please DO NOT buy this product. Substituting, one or a few bad ingredients for another is unacceptable and proper education is the key.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is time that we, the people, stand against ANY corporation who continue to be instrumental in providing any product &amp;/or service that is not within 100% of our humanitarian rights and that is to provide exceptional quality products; for our children, our family, and our own lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Many herbal toothpastes do not contain fluoride or sodium lauryl sulfate. The ingredients found in natural toothpastes vary widely but often include baking soda, aloe, eucalyptus oil, myrrh, plant extract (strawberry extract), and essential oils. In addition to the commercially available products, it is possible to make one&#x27;s own toothpaste using similar ingredients\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read more at: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a all natural toothpaste you can make yourself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awakened1&#x27;s All Natural Toothpaste:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combine: (3) tablespoon, Baking Soda; 1-2 drops of Peroxide; 1/2 teaspoon of Activated Charcoal; Water; and finally, Peppermint Essential Oil for taste. Stir until it thickens or hardens like a paste; store in a plastic container and refrigerate over night. You may also choose to add (2) tablespoon of Coconut Oil. Mix well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not necessary to keep it there after initial thickening has been achieved. This is safe for children of all ages and can be used everyday. There are a number of other essential oils you can try for taste such as orange, cinnamon, rosemary and eucalyptus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note activated charcoal will turn toothpaste black and no, it will not stain your teeth. This has a very long shelf life and taste great. I recommend trying a small mixture first until you achieve that exact taste and consistency; then gradually, building up to more product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not use metal of any kind (bowl or utensils); use a wooden Popsicle stick (really) or spoon to stir all ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ** I highly suggest trying &#x27;oil pulling&#x27; 2-3x&#x27;s a week and then followup with this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Continual use of oil pulling can reduce plaque and gingivitis; reduce bad breath and promote healthy gums and teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Activated Charcoal:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taste:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I did try the product (before I read the packaging); the taste was bland and product was flat; it was difficult to keep on my toothbrush and it dissolved within seconds. I did not feel this product made my breath feel its absolute best/clean. I kepthaving to reapply. A girlfriend thought the cinnamon was just as bad; this is one product over-all, I will never re-buy; don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few recommendations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.

    <li> What you want in a toothpaste:&lt;br /&gt;- Xylitol&lt;br /&gt;- No glycerin (coats the teeth)&lt;br /&gt;- No weird additives&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check, check, check!  Tastes great too.  No tingling burning feeling so my toddler isn&#x27;t afraid to use it.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is so amazing. It is healthy and tastes great. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth and I know I brush longer then I ever did before my discovery of Earthpaste. So far Lemon is the only flavor I have tried but I am hooked. Eventually I will try them all and stock up. I will never go back to regular toothpaste. In fact I was in the store and looked at the 4 or 5 so called \\&quot;natural options\\&quot; and every single one of them have glycerin. Glycerin puts a film over your teeth so your helpful saliva has a harder time killing the germs that cause plaque. Not to mention it is poisonous. It makes me shudder to think little kids put poison in there mouth 2 or more times a day and us there parents have been giving it to them. I feel like I was duped all these years. Don&#x27;t believe me? Go read your toothpaste right now it says if more then is used for brushing is swallowed call poison control. Why take any chances? Other countries have banned fluoride. Do the research.</li>
    <li> Our family loves this toothpaste. Totally natural and devoid of the bad stuff. Yummy natural lemon flavor. Yes, it&#x27;s a weird beige color but it does have earth clay in it...teeth seem whiter and mouth feels very clean and fresh after use.</li>
    <li> My teeth just don&#x27;t feel clean after brushing, even with a Sonicare toothbrush. They feel slippery with a layer of deposits that weren&#x27;t there before brushing. I will go back to Squiggle or try another natural paste.</li>
    <li> This is OK but I don&#x27;t particularly like the flavor. I always use natural toothpaste with no mint so this fit the bill but I like others better.</li>
    <li> My friend swears by this stuff, but after using it for 2 weeks I started getting serious gum issues - bleeding and ripping.  It was awful.  My teeth always felt &amp;#34;furry&amp;#34; too.  So, now I use it now and then with chemical yucky toothpaste.  But, as I say, my friend&#x27;s been using it for years and her teeth are beautiful and her gums are happy.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite flavor but this is great toothpaste. Maybe kids would prefer this but I am kinda used to a minty taste. Just don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve brushed my teeth unless it tastes like mint.</li>
    <li> I would not have bought this product if I had known about the LEAD warning. This should be listed as part of the product description. I stopped using it immediately as soon as I saw the warning.</li>
    <li> Heard about this toothpaste from a friend when I mentioned I was looking for a more natural toothpaste after I found out Jason was bought out. Bought this flavor for my daughter &amp; I have the cinnamon for my husband &amp; I. My daughter does not complain about this toothpaste and actually asks to brush her teeth every night! It does not foam which does take some getting used to but you still don&#x27;t need very much of it so it lasts a long time for us. Will be ordering as long as it&#x27;s in stock!</li>
    <li> My 2 yr old loves the lemon flavor! And it&#x27;s safe for him to eat (for when he wouldn&#x27;t rinse and spit) .</li>
    <li> Kids did not like it. Said it left their mouth dry. They prefer the Coral White Toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Ummmm, this has LEAD in it. I feel like an idiot for buying this crap without reading the reviews in more detail first. Toothpaste should not contain lead.</li>
    <li> not your contemporary toothbrush but definitely leaves your teeth feeling close to what it&#x27;s like after a cleaning - and with a GREAT lemon taste. if the price weren&#x27;t so steep this would be a staple in my house.</li>
    <li> WHY I TRIED IT:  I tried this toothpaste because I really miss the lemon-flavored (with just a hint of mint) toothpaste that a national brand offered, very badly promoted, then cancelled due to lack of interest, duh!  It was like brushing your teeth with lemon pie but it left behind a hint of fresh mint -- I looked forward to brushing like never before, and I&#x27;m 58 years old!    MY EXPECTATION AND MY RESULTS:  I did not totally believe the EarthPaste reviewers, but one reviewer said it whitened her teeth.  Uh huh, sure it did, I sneered.  That&#x27;s what I initially thought, but I bought it anyway.  Then I tried it for just one week.  At the end of the week, I looked at the results, and sure enough, my TEETH WERE WHITER, truly whiter!  I generally bleach my teeth every few months with a kit from a dentist using perfectly fitted trays, which is quite effective if used regularly.  I hadn&#x27;t bleached for about 6 months, so I was definitely overdue.  I&#x27;m very pleased with how smooth and glass-like the enamel surface is, but the whitening blew me away!    MY COMPLAINT:  My only complaint is that the flavor isn&#x27;t nearly strong enough, and there&#x27;s not even a hint of mint, and I REALLY miss that.  I know there are people who don&#x27;t want a highly minted paste, and they should like this, because it&#x27;s as close to tasteless as I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
    <li> My daughter has been using this toothpaste for over a year and wants nothing else!</li>
    <li> I searched for quite some time to find a safe toothpaste for myself and family. Initially, I was trying to find a simple homemade concoction that I did not dread brushing with, but came across Earthpaste. I am so glad I gave it a whirl. This stuff is great. My mouth feels clean and I can even get my almost 3yr old and 5 yr old kiddos to use it without any problems. Lemon is pleasant and for adults that cinnamon is also delightful. It does take some time to get used to as it does not foam/lather like commercial paste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dental hygienist with an interest in natural dental products.  I researched abrasivity (how abrasive to your enamel) toothpastes are compared to each other.  Silica is in many products, and if this one contains an abrasivity close to that of slilica, I would steer clear.  It is now known that silica is too coarse for enamel, and you should not let the hygienist &#x27;polish&#x27; your teeth with paste polish because micro particles of enamel are sanded off during the process.  Toothpaste can cause recession of your gums over time if you are brushing vigorously.  I recommend to my patients to use the original Arm &amp; Hammer baking soda toothpaste (mostly baking soda, less silica) or just straight Baking Soda.  It is a fine particle that dissolves in saliva, cleans great, acts as  tonic for the gums, and won&#x27;t hurt your enamel.  Just dip your tooth brush in water first, and then in the baking soda (I keep it in a pill vial with a wide mouth).  Shake off the extra, and it is enough to do your whole mouth.  Our mouths let many chemicals in through our mucosa, so I was finished with commercial products and their unknown chemicals.  Happy brushing!</li>
    <li> This was tasty but somewhat difficult to get out of the tube. I found it a bit too abrasive for my taste, my gums are bothered by it if I use it too often. I now use it once a day before bed because I never liked the idea of toothpaste with inedible ingreds lingering in my mouth while I slept.</li>
    <li> Great product. My wife, myself, and 3 kids 5 and under love it. Our dentist had never heard of it, but was inclined to research it after seeing improvement in my teeth.</li>
    <li> To be honest, I wanted to get a toothpaste that is fluoride-free and this certainly is. I did not, however, enjoy the the product as I hoped I would. I think I&#x27;ve just gotten so accustomed to the frothiness from Crest, Colgate and other mainstream products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does do the job though, and I&#x27;m sure many others are happy with this product as well.</li>
    <li> This paste is NOT meant to foam. You do not need foam to effectively clean your teeth! The taste is wonderful, and I find this to be a long-lasting product if you use a pea-size amount as recommended. This paste offers a very different experience when compared to traditional foamy toothpaste, but if you use it with your expectations reasonably set I think you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
    <li> Wonderful natural paste for kids! My child loves it and keeps brushing.</li>
    <li> The lemon flavor is our family&#x27;s favorite!</li>
    <li> new favorite toothpaste!!!  Lemon flavor tastes GREAT!  Bought lots for friends too!  No flouride, thank you!!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a toothpaste that does so much for your teeth and gums as opposed to just cleaning this is it. It restores the enamel and also keeps the health of the teeth there. Highly recommend this product. Just be warned because it has zero chemicals and fillers and crap in it you will find that it doesn&#x27;t leave the same refreshed feeling as the others do.  The peppermint flavor does to a degree but the chemical loaded toothpaste leaves it longer.</li>
    <li> I love Redmond products, that is why I was disappointed with this toothpaste. It leaves your teeth feeling like you need to brush again - not clean at all. Won&#x27;t be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> Earthpaste does a very good job of cleaning and whitening teeth. It has a pleasant mild lemon verbena taste. My teeth are noticeably whiter and cleaner after using this product. This paste works better for me than commercial toothpastes at removing tartar buildup. The only drawback to using Earthpaste is that my teeth become sensitive after using the product exclusively. I like to alternate between using Earthpaste and a baking soda/coconut oil homemade toothpaste for best results and less sensitivity.</li>
    <li> I loved the concept... and even the lemon twist (although I was told lemons&#x27; acid ruined enamel- didn&#x27;t think of that when I wanted to try it), However, the flavor was so light, I feel there was even enough lemon to ruin anything...lol.&lt;br /&gt;I did not give it a three star because I didn&#x27;t like it... I really liked it actually. I missed the foam..lol, and I missed the minty taste that comes with that clean feeling in your mouth.  And that was the only thing I did&#x27;t like.  My mouth still felt dirty because I still had some morning breath... Morning breath is not always my cup of tea. I would go through the day wondering, &amp;#34;did I brush my teeth?&amp;#34; Well, at least it got me to brush my teeth more:-)!</li>
    <li> Awesome product, my 3 &amp; 5 year old love it! They call it their lemon cookie toothpaste. They love that it doesn&#x27;t foam like other toothpastes, and I love that it doesn&#x27;t have crazy things in it or on the packaging to MAKE kids like it. It works great and leaves your mouth very fresh.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for over a year &amp; still have my Teeth. It&#x27;s a good product with 0 Flouride. You might want to order more than 1 tube . For everyday use a tube might last two weeks</li>
    <li> The lemon flavor is really mild, but it cleans really well!! Might not order this flavor again, but that&#x27;s just because I like some of the others even more!</li>
    <li> There are many things I like about this toothpaste. The most important is that it has natural ingredients and doesn&#x27;t contain glycerine, which prevents teeth from remineralizing. I had such a hard time finding any toothpaste without glycerine in it. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth like many mint toothpastes do. The citrus oils make my tongue tingle a little and I wish they weren&#x27;t as  strong, but they don&#x27;t burn and after a few weeks my mouth got used to them. One thing I find a bit strange is that even though I rinse out my mouth after brushing, a while later I have a slight salty taste in my mouth. It doesn&#x27;t bother me, it&#x27;s just different. Another thing some might find odd is the texture of the toothpaste. As soon as you start brushing, it just disappears in your mouth. It feels like you&#x27;re brushing with nothing on your toothbrush. I don&#x27;t know if I need to keep putting more on my toothbrush. I wish it was thicker or somehow stuck to your teeth better. The reason I&#x27;m not giving this toothpaste 5 stars is that I&#x27;m noticing more tartar build-up on the back of my teeth, and my teeth are becoming more sensitive.</li>
    <li> The flavor is good, but I&#x27;m finding that I have to use kind of a lot of it to get a good clean mouth. I love the flavor and ingredients though!</li>
    <li> Not sure about the toothpaste, not for everyday.</li>
    <li> I bought the lemon flavor for my kids (ages 1 and 4), they love it.  It doesn&#x27;t foam much but leaves your teeth feeling clean.  The best part is that its totally safe for little ones to swallow and doesn&#x27;t have any questionable ingredients.  If your looking for SLS free and glycerin free, this is it!</li>
    <li> Missed the warning label before purchasing. Unsure if it was advertised but the warning states there are trace amounts of lead, and that it is not recommended for the pregnant or children.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t be using.</li>
    <li> The lemon flavor is good. The children liked it. I prefer a minty finish on my toothpaste, and this tastes more like Lemonheads candy - which is yummy, but doesn&#x27;t make me feel like I&#x27;ve brushed my teeth. I think it&#x27;s perfect for children, though, especially those who find mint too spicy.</li>
    <li> Due to the toxicity of flouride and other ingredients in most mainstream toothpastes, I decided to search for something as natural as possible, and I think this product fits the bill.  First of all, it definitely FEELS natural.  There&#x27;s no foaming (and they explain that the paste does not contain foaming ingredients) and there&#x27;s no bright white, blue, green, etc. coloring (it&#x27;s the color of the earth tone on the tube).  At first, this may put you off.  After a lifetime of using commercial toothpastes, this might take some gettin&#x27; used to.  Because of the lack of foaming agents, it feels like you need a whole lot of paste to get the same cleaning power.  I doubt that&#x27;s true, though--it&#x27;s probably just in my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The peace of mind I feel knowing that my family&#x27;s not accidentally ingesting poison on a daily basis is well worth any difference or adjustment that we&#x27;ll have to face.  The taste is fine and it does its job cleaning.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever purchase another tube of commercial, flouride toothpaste anymore.  By the way, I feel just as clean after using this toothpaste as I feel after using Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpaste.  And in fact, I prefer the taste of Earthpaste Lemon Twist over Tom&#x27;s of Maine.</li>
    <li> this was the first time I&#x27;ve tried Redmond EarthPaste. I bought the lemon &amp; the spearmint -both are fantastic!! they are not sticky and do not foam up like regular toothpaste. mouth feels clean &amp; teeth smooth. when used before bed, morning &amp;#34;dragon breath&amp;#34; is also greatly reduced. I still use coconut oil (oil pulling method) several times a week as well.</li>
    <li> My two year old loves this stuff, requests to brush his teeth just so he can use it :) I have to watch, though, because he once found the tube and was trying to eat it. Fortunately it&#x27;s safe to eat, which is another reason I bought it.</li>
    <li> Although I bought this specially to help combat PD (perioral dermatitis), since this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t contain SLS, I haven&#x27;t used it as much as I&#x27;d intended. The taste doesn&#x27;t give my mouth the clean feel regular toothpastes do. It&#x27;s probably an acquired taste, and I will use the tube but won&#x27;t reorder. My PD has been much better though I haven&#x27;t used this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is pretty good. One thing that I dislike about it is that it doesn&#x27;t foam *at all*. Some other very natural toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried will get a little foamy, and it helps me get a feel for how clean my teeth are getting and even how hard I&#x27;m brushing. I find that when I brush with the same force using Earthpaste as I use with any other toothpaste, the Earthpaste makes my gums hurt. I usually just use a little of this and a little of some other paste on my toothbrush together and I find that to be a superior brushing experience.</li>
    <li> I have been using Earthpaste for about 6 months now, and I have nothing but great things to say.... Cinnamon is still my favorite, but the lemon is a close 2nd!</li>
    <li> Tastes great, teeth feel very clean after brushing.</li>
    <li> i appreciate natural products such as these but the deceptive advertisement really angered me.  i didn&#x27;t even realize it until i tried using the toothpaste.....which did nothing for my teeth or mouth.  my whole mouth still felt &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34;.  i took a closer look at the toothpaste and realized that is says: &amp;#34;FOR KIDS&amp;#34;!!! what a complete waste of time!</li>
    <li> I went to my local store to get a better look at the ingredients of this toothpaste, only to find the CA prop 65 warning, stating that this product contains small amounts of lead and SHOULD NOT BE USED BY PREGNANT WOMEN AND CHILDREN! I checked the ingredients and assume that the lead is in the Bentonite clay that&#x27;s one of the first ingredients. Shame on these people...</li>
    <li> I wish I would have known there was lead in it before buying it. I don&#x27;t mind using it for myself since I won&#x27;t ingest it, but I got it for my toddler (who does eat whatever is on her toothbrush) so I&#x27;m a little annoyed I have to find a different natural paste with no lead in it.&lt;br /&gt;Minus the lead, it does work great. Getting used to non foaming toothpaste is...different to say the least</li>
    <li> This toothpaste contains unsafe levels of lead. http://leadsafeamerica.org/earthpaste/&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed and will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> My kids do not like spicy toothpaste so they gave this a try.  They like it.  It works well and cleans their teeth nicely.  It is very hard to wash out of the sink.</li>
    <li> Purchased this to introduce my child toothpaste. Ingredients are important to me especially with her. She adores it, let&#x27;s me brush with ease and likes the flavor. It&#x27;s ok to swallow and is often swallowed here. I like it so much myself I have also switched. Gives my teeth a just left a cleaning feel!</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste!</li>
    <li> I like the ingredients, especially the added xylitol .  Unfortunately, I have to use tons of toothpaste to get my teeth clean.  Never used so much with any other natural brand.  Seems not too expensive,  but really is because using so much for each brushing.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think to read the reviews first...It contains lead!!!  (which I discovered only after getting the product and reading the back of the box.)</li>
    <li> I use this on my kids teeth. Its not perfect,  it doesn&#x27;t do anything for bad breath.  But its non toxic and safe to swallow.</li>
    <li> Sorry, I just did not like this toothpaste, it just dissapeard in my mouth and it felt like I was not using anything at all. My mouth never felt &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;, went back to Kiss My Face toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I just love this toothpaste, its mild and pleasant and left my teeth feeling really clean. I would order this again and will try the other flavors.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothpaste because I was wanted one without fluoride and without glycerine. The flavor is good, if a little weak. It is only slightly lemon-y. The toothpaste seems to dissolve very quickly so I am not sure if I am really spreading it around my mouth or if I&#x27;m brushing areas mainly with water. There is no foaming aspect to this toothpaste like other toothpastes so it takes a little getting used to. It does clean my teeth well, I haven&#x27;t noticed any differences in that area, but it doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling minty fresh/squeaky clean like other toothpastes. I am satisfied with this toothpaste, but will probably try something new when this tube runs out.</li>
    <li> Love it, tastes good.  Feels good.</li>
