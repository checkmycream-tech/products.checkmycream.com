      <li>But I really really loved the way they packed it.  </li>
      <li>Good thing I sprayed it in the cap to test the smell.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s good</li>
      <li>I have the moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, the oil, the hair masque and the treatment spray, all of which I am very pleased with.  </li>
      <li>I also am very pleased with the cost.</li>
      <li>It did a good job and was a nice flexible hold</li>
      <li>Love these products!</li>
      <li>Use this product and you will love it!</li>

      <li>It smells really nice too.</li>
      <li>Good thing the smell mostly goes away after it dries on your hair, but every time I use it it makes me worried.</li>
      <li>It gives my hair a nice shine and makes it softer too.</li>
      <li>Nice hairspray.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine hair</li>
      <li>Has a great hold and makes my hair very silky and shiny looking!</li>
      <li>While I love the aragon hair oil, I do not like this finishing spray.</li>
      <li>My daughter and I both love this product.</li>
      <li>I will be getting more from Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this stuff.  </li>
      <li>They make my hair feel shiny and healthy.</li>
      <li>The hair spray from this brand is much better and does not leave hair sticky.  </li>
      <li>Love the scent &amp; how it holds my wavy hair in place without helmet head look in humid or arid climates.</li>
      <li>I love this oil.</li>
      <li>Have reordered this many times... love it.</li>
      <li>Thought would be more conditioning with the argan oil but didn&#x27;t get that.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of Agadir Argan Oil products.  </li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t use more than one spritz</li>
      <li>It sprays in a more concentrated spritz rather than a light mist</li>
      <li>I odered this to try for the first time and I have to say I LOVE it!</li>
      <li>I have rather fine hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a senior with baby fine hair.</li>
      <li>They have to show me how to pack that hair styling oil since they did a fabulous job packing it.  </li>
      <li>I also will spray it lightly over my hair when I&#x27;m finished.</li>
      <li>The extra luster after syling is also great.</li>
      <li>It is light, yet holds well.</li>
      <li>great hairs spritz to hold all day long, does not give you buildup on your hair.</li>
      <li>Also very nice to spray and curl for curls with shine and hold all day long !</li>
      <li>If your hair is really oily, this may work better for you.</li>
      <li>but i guess its cool</li>
      <li>The scent is strong at first, but quickly fades.</li>
      <li>I have straight, fine hair with lots of baby strays and the spray does not work for me.  </li>
      <li>Gives my hair just the right amount of hold to maintain the style I wear.</li>
      <li>I finally found a hair spray that works,that holds but not stiff, and smells good.</li>
      <li>I highly recomment the fine mist to gently keep hair from frizzing.  </li>
      <li>This had brought a youthful and healthy look back along with volume.</li>
      <li>After many products later, this spritz was given to me.</li>
      <li>it was more than double the price.</li>
      <li>I saw this SAME product at a beauty shop and asked how much thinking I would get more from them....</li>
      <li>Final little spritz and good for the day!</li>
      <li>The spray is holding very well, just as promised on the label.</li>
      <li>I am thrilled to find a product to keep my hair from going limp when I sweat!  </li>
      <li>I have very dry hair that frizzes easily</li>
      <li>Your hair will hold a little bit better, but still, it doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
      <li>so this is definitely not the right product.</li>
      <li>Makes it much easier to flat iron, and our hair is much smoother.</li>
      <li>I used the regular argan oil previously, but I like this so much better.</li>
      <li>Since the shampoo and oil have improved my hair 100%, I was sure that this styling product would at least not harm it.  </li>
      <li>It reminds me of an old lady&#x27;s perfume.</li>
      <li>Smells nice, holds well, lasts, no white residue after application if hair is moved, works well in high humidity, lasts long time, rinses out easily, a little expensive and would like a non scented version for mens but the scent is nice and not at all over powering</li>
      <li>I prefer something less wet and with a lot more holding capability.</li>
      <li>I generally like the Agadir brand.  </li>
      <li>I really think that it has cut down on the time it takes to blowdry my hair.  </li>

<li> The smell is strong and not pleasant and it is a very wet spray.</li>
<li> or it gets crunchy and flat.</li>
<li> but I stopped using it because my husband said, &amp;#34;You smell like a stale old bar maid.&amp;#34; Yes, he used those exact words.</li>
<li> and they blow dry it.  </li>
<li> What I have found to be helpful is to generously spray your damp hair with the product and then blow dry.  </li>
<li> It was not clear from the product description that this spritz is EXTRA FIRM HOLD, which is not something I wanted.  </li>
<li> Just not what I expected.</li>
<li> so you have to be careful.</li>
<li> I purchased this product at the recommendation on my hair stylist (but I ordered from Amazon due to the lower price).  </li>
<li> Will be trying their other products.</li>
<li> Keeps my hair in place without making it stiff and flaky; and there is no residual build up that other products used to make my hair dry.</li>
<li> and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or look like I have sprayed it</li>
<li> I even use this on my little boys hair.</li>
<li> I does have a firm hold on hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It helps my hair stay up somewhat (: but i guess its cool</li>
    <li> I prefer something less wet and with a lot more holding capability. I have very dry hair that frizzes easily so this is definitely not the right product. If your hair is really oily, this may work better for you.</li>
    <li> Love the scent &amp; how it holds my wavy hair in place without helmet head look in humid or arid climates.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good but I made a mistake and did not realize it was a spritz.</li>
    <li> I generally like the Agadir brand.  I have the moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, the oil, the hair masque and the treatment spray, all of which I am very pleased with.  However, this finishing spray doesn&#x27;t hold well at all.  I have straight, fine hair with lots of baby strays and the spray does not work for me.  What I have found to be helpful is to generously spray your damp hair with the product and then blow dry.  Your hair will hold a little bit better, but still, it doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. But I really really loved the way they packed it.  They have to show me how to pack that hair styling oil since they did a fabulous job packing it.  I will always order this spritz from Amazon. So Amazon you have a permanent customer.  So Thank You Amazon. This is a very good spritz since my hairdresser use it on my hair so thank you again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have been using for over a year. When Redkin discontinued some of their product line, I was left searching for a replacement. After many products later, this spritz was given to me. It is light, yet holds well. I do not find it sticky at all. My hair is fine, and when styling, it gives me great volume, without any weight. My hair always looks shiny. The scent is strong at first, but quickly fades. Will be trying their other products.</li>
    <li> Since the shampoo and oil have improved my hair 100%, I was sure that this styling product would at least not harm it.  Well I was totally wrong.  It&#x27;s like applying a permanent glue to your hair.  Took me 30 minutes this morning to comb it all out and in doing so I lost alot of hair.  Please advise Agadir to take it off the market.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I highly recomment the fine mist to gently keep hair from frizzing.  The extra luster after syling is also great.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both love this product. Makes it much easier to flat iron, and our hair is much smoother.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT.  Costs $15 cheaper than my regular salon sells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the smell.  have lots of compliments on my hair shine, smell and how healthy it looks!!</li>
    <li> Makes hair sticky, and smells bad.  The hair spray from this brand is much better and does not leave hair sticky.  I read the reviews so I was hoping to like it :(</li>
    <li> I like the effect and love other Agadir products, but this one has a pretty bad hair sprayish smell...</li>
    <li> I odered this to try for the first time and I have to say I LOVE it! I use it everyday. It gives my hair a nice shine and makes it softer too. I even use this on my little boys hair. It smells really nice too. I also am very pleased with the cost. I saw this SAME product at a beauty shop and asked how much thinking I would get more from them....lol...it was more than double the price. I will be getting more from Amazon.com. Thank you!</li>
    <li> It was not clear from the product description that this spritz is EXTRA FIRM HOLD, which is not something I wanted.  I&#x27;m passing it on to someone else, but this fact should be included in the product description.</li>
    <li> I loved this finishing spray!  I can use daily between shampoos--light hold with no buildup!  The aroma is heavenly--like all Agadir products!</li>
    <li> While I love the aragon hair oil, I do not like this finishing spray. The smell is strong and not pleasant and it is a very wet spray.</li>
    <li> Not the best product.  Had it a year+ and have only used it 2-3 times.  Just not what I expected.</li>
    <li> The spray is holding very well, just as promised on the label. The odor of this product is close to that of the rest of Agadir product line, but not quite the same. It reminds me of an old lady&#x27;s perfume. Good thing the smell mostly goes away after it dries on your hair, but every time I use it it makes me worried.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Agadir Argan Oil products.  Unfortunately, the Finishing Spray is sticky and not at all like the Spray Treatment.  You have to use it sparingly.</li>
    <li> Has a great hold and makes my hair very silky and shiny looking! Got the rec from Jaclyn HIll! Watch her videos on YouTube. She is amazing!!!</li>
    <li> I love it!! That is all I use!!</li>
    <li> I finally found a hair spray that works,that holds but not stiff, and smells good. This is a great line of products.I use the shampoo,conditioner,and gel also.</li>
    <li> Perfect to control frizzy hair!</li>
    <li> Received item as promised. Gives my hair just the right amount of hold to maintain the style I wear. Would definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have several items from this brand and I like the oil treatment and the heat protecting spray a lot, but the finishing spray isn&#x27;t great. It sprays in a more concentrated spritz rather than a light mist so you have to be careful. I have rather fine hair and I can&#x27;t use more than one spritz or it gets crunchy and flat. I prefer the one I used before this, Dove finishing spray. Might go back to that...</li>
    <li> This is a great product for both styling and finishing your hair. Since I started using this product my hair has become softer and&lt;br /&gt;more manageable. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Use this product and you will love it! This is just a workable spritz! Final little spritz and good for the day!</li>
    <li> I am thrilled to find a product to keep my hair from going limp when I sweat!  I am also happy to retain my style when the wind hits my hair.</li>
    <li> Protects hair from frizzing and leaves hair with a wonderful scent.  Would definitely recommend for anyone with hair that tends to frizz.</li>
    <li> Good thing I sprayed it in the cap to test the smell. It Had the smell of driving along I-80 through the Pinole oil refinery. Oh yessssss. That bad.</li>
    <li> Smells like beer.  It did a good job and was a nice flexible hold but I stopped using it because my husband said, &amp;#34;You smell like a stale old bar maid.&amp;#34; Yes, he used those exact words.</li>
    <li> Love these products! They work great.. No flaking or build up. Product smells great as well.</li>
    <li> Nice hairspray.  I have very fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or look like I have sprayed it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of hair products over the years, but this is one of the best ones ever. I use the shampoo, conditioner, mousse and then this finishing spray. They make my hair feel shiny and healthy. The style stays without looking stiff. Great smell too!</li>
    <li> great hairs spritz to hold all day long, does not give you buildup on your hair. Also very nice to spray and curl for curls with shine and hold all day long !</li>
    <li> Smells nice, holds well, lasts, no white residue after application if hair is moved, works well in high humidity, lasts long time, rinses out easily, a little expensive and would like a non scented version for mens but the scent is nice and not at all over powering</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair in place without making it stiff and flaky; and there is no residual build up that other products used to make my hair dry.</li>
    <li> I have tried almost all hair products but the Agadir line will be the only one for me. I&#x27;m a senior with baby fine hair. This had brought a youthful and healthy look back along with volume. Great product.</li>
    <li> This product is the best smelling product that I have ever used.  I does have a firm hold on hair.</li>
    <li> When I use this liquid spray and then hit humidity, it goes frizzy. Thought would be more conditioning with the argan oil but didn&#x27;t get that.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> Have reordered this many times... love it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at the recommendation on my hair stylist (but I ordered from Amazon due to the lower price).  I LOVE this stuff.  I really think that it has cut down on the time it takes to blowdry my hair.  I like to spray this stuff all over my hair and they blow dry it.  I also will spray it lightly over my hair when I&#x27;m finished. I used the regular argan oil previously, but I like this so much better.</li>
