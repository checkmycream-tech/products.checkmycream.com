    <li> Great quality. The brush is made of synthetic fibers, it&#x27;s really soft and applies the makeup evenly. I had tried the new BareMin brush at a makeup store and this brush feels exactly the same</li>
    <li> This brush is wonderful, I would strongly recommend it. The bristles are short and sturdy to apply the foundation.</li>
    <li> So glad I found this brush. I love how soft  it feels and that it doesn&#x27;t shed when you use it like other brushes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

    <li> can&#x27;t believe the quality for the price. Amazing!</li>
    <li> This brush is nice.  It is well made and nice quality for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this little brush! I&#x27;m not an MUA but this brush is perfect for everything! I use it to apply my liquid foundation, contouring powder even to blend my eyeshadow! And I feared it would be too small, but the brush is perfect size to work with in your hands and on your face ! I love this brush and I would recommend it to anyone from professionals to beginners!</li>
    <li> Love this....brush is soft and very dense it makes liquid application easy n look seamless</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good. Just loved</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying I have never before used a brush for applying foundation. I hardly ever wear it so, this review if from a newbe and one w/ nothing to compare to. I am using this with the Bare Minerals BareSkin and the brush sold by them is a ridiculous price. I believe in paying for what you get however, being new to the whole thing I wanted to get a tester (cheaper) brush first. I WILL STAY WITH THIS BRUSH. It&#x27;s more than I could have asked for and it&#x27;s a great price!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s soft, yet firm. Before I used it I couldn&#x27;t get the logic on how the make-up would float on the top of the brush and not fall down the bristles and gunk up. It doesn&#x27;t it!! I like this because you use less product. Bareskin is NOT cheap. With this brush you literally can cover your face with 2-3 tiny drops of product. When I applied it by hand I used so much more. So again, you are saving $$.&lt;br /&gt;I think the brush is a great value. Good quality (again, nothing to compare too). But I&#x27;ve had it over a month and none of the hairs are gunked. None of them are falling out. That&#x27;s a good sign.&lt;br /&gt;Good choice on my part!</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT IDEA FOR LIQUID MAKEUP APPLICATION AT A VERY GOOD PRICE. I HAVE SEEN THIS BRUSH AT A&lt;br /&gt;COST OF $28.00. TRY THIS ONE AT A FANTASTIC PRICE.</li>
    <li> FLAWLESS FINISH... Although i have many brushes by far this is my favorite brush! I recently purchased three more of these brushes because i loved them soo much! Helps with full coverage foundation and is also really great for blending and conturing!! Leaves no harsh lines. I definitely recommend buying this brush with out hesitation!</li>
    <li> I love it! I use it everyday, it does the job and the brush is very soft.</li>
    <li> AWESOME brush! So glad I bought this!!</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the wait. This product is great. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Great! Love it! Shipped quick! Its affortable and great quality! STRONGLY RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> Great foundation brush, very even coverage.</li>
    <li> Brush felt really soft. But got ruined once I washed it. Now it&#x27;s all hard.</li>
    <li> First time using a brush. I always used my hands.  Love love love this!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this brush!! Can&#x27;t go wrong with the price as well.</li>
    <li> I just wish it was larger other than that its a good buy</li>
    <li> this brush applies my foundation really well and fit the price? can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
