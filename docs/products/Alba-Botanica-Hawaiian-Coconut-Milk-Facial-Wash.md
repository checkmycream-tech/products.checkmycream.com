<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The best face wash, moist and clean skin, love this</li>
    <li> Love, love, love!!!!  Another awesome product from Alba Botanical.  Their products are always aces!!!  I highly recommend!!!!!!</li>
    <li> After giving birth to my son, my skin went from oily to ultra sensitive, dry, red and flaky. I&#x27;ve tried Aveeno Ultra Calming and Simply Sensitive Skin Moisturizing cleanser, but they did nothing for my face. To prevent redness, I had to apply moisturizer cream immediately after washing my face with these cleansers. And to prevent (more like cover up) the flakiness, I had to apply moisturizer cream 3 times a day. I was afraid to blow away money on expensive brand products like Estee Lauder or Clinique in case they don&#x27;t work either. So I decided give Alba&#x27;s Hawaiian Coconut Milk cleanser a try. I was still hesitant to use it due to it having some alcohol ingredient. After 3 days of using it, I noticed that the redness and flakiness are gone. On the 4th day, I decided to be a little daring and not apply moisturizer cream right after washing my face. Today is a week since I&#x27;ve used this product. No more redness and flakiness. I&#x27;ve been applying moisturizer cream only once a day. My face doesn&#x27;t feel dry anymore right after washing it. I have yet to breakout with this cleanser. However, I knew mine were caused by the dryness of my face. So no my face is no longer dry, I have no new breakouts.</li>
    <li> love this facial wash. I have very sensitive skin and this one doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts and keeps my skin moist and clean.</li>
    <li> The only thing I use on my face.</li>
    <li> I have a strange combination of sensitive/dry and breakout prone skin, and have tried many products over the years.  Picked this up on a whim, and now I&#x27;m hooked.  It cleans without drying, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, takes off makeup, made the breakouts disappear, and just to top it off, it smells wonderful.  It doesn&#x27;t cost any more than a lot of the other products at my big box store, and that is a definite plus.  It&#x27;s a little cheaper here on Amazon.  I&#x27;ll be buying several bottles and stocking up.</li>
    <li> This is a great face wash! I&#x27;ve been using their leave-in conditioner when I went to switch to a paraben-free face wash and found this. Super gentle on my sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve never broken out while using it, even in the summer. Smells a bit like cough syrup in a weird sort of way rather than coconut, but I don&#x27;t even care because it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> Although this cleansing wash claims to nourish and smooth the skin, it has only dried mine out further, making breakouts even more apparent than they already were. I was disappointed that the &amp;#34;100% vegetarian ingredients&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t live up to the expectations I had. In the past, other natural/organic cleansers worked to limit my acne, but this product has only enhanced it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s more, the 4th ingredient listed is cetearyl alcohol. Alcohol typically has an overdrying effect on the skin, which makes sense why this product didn&#x27;t soothe my sensitive skin at all! Do not recommend to those seeking a natural face wash.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell, it gets annoying after a couple washes.</li>
    <li> Really nice, face feels moist after taking it off, dries softly not like your face will crack and have to put moisturizer on quickly.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin that dries out quickly. The Alba cleansing face washes are the only product I can use that doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out, become scaly, beat-red and cost a fortune.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this cleanser, it feels so good going on. However after about a week of use I have dry patches on my cheeks. Like another reviewer said, the second and fourth ingredients are alcohol. I will be exchanging this and going back to the pineapple enzyme cleanser (which I have been using for years without a problem, but the store was out so I gave this one a try). I am 40 with combination sensitive skin. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Smells like heaven and feels so soothing and gentle on my skin.  I had read many great reviews about this product and I am pleased to say they were all correct.  My skin feels very soft and calm after I use it, no greasy afterfeel.  Feels like it should cost a lot more.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer and cleanser all in one.  It leaves my face clean and smooth and reduces the dry spots in my face.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be great; however, after a week of using it, I broke out in terrible acne.</li>
    <li> I have horribly dry skin that peels/sheds if I don&#x27;t take care of it, so discovering this two years ago was a blessing. I bought two bottles from Walmart and I just finished both, so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the money, except now you can&#x27;t reseal it anymore. You used to be able to twist the cap and lock it shut, so I&#x27;d bring it with me when I traveled. I&#x27;m sorry to see that it&#x27;s not an option anymore, or maybe it&#x27;s a different version sold in stores.  Anyways, when I finally ran out, I was too lazy to go back to Walmart to buy some more and just borrowed my family&#x27;s facewashes. They have combination/oily skin. Bad idea. My face started peeling, so I scrambled to Amazon to order a bottle and my skin is back to feeling smooth again (most of the time). I haven&#x27;t found anything else that works as well as this.  Just don&#x27;t confuse this with the pineapple wash, which looks almost exactly the same. You do not want that if you&#x27;ve got dry skin.</li>
    <li> Feels really nice on my skin.</li>
    <li> A seriously amazing face wash. I have extremely sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate at all. I love how moisturizing it feels and would certainly recommend it</li>
    <li> This is just what it says it is: milky, creamy, non-sudzing cleanser for sensitive skin. It has a nice fragrance and I was very surprised that it had a pleasing tingly sensation. I found myself leaving it on my face for a few minutes in the shower as a mini facial. It doesn&#x27;t get make up off very well, but doesn&#x27;t claim to. (Alba says to use the pineapple/papaya enzyme cleanser for that.) This is the perfect morning cleanser for when my face doesn&#x27;t have makeup but needs cleansing and I don&#x27;t want to start the day off dry and undo all the goodness that my night creams claim to be doing. I am a bit nervous to see how well it wears under my makeup because I tend to get greasy mid-day because I end up over compensating for the flaky, dry skin. I hope this will help solve the problem skin, not just treat the symptoms. I like it so far, but will get the other Alba cleanser for night time make up removal.</li>
    <li> This cleanser isn&#x27;t a soap, it&#x27;s a cream cleanser. It doesn&#x27;t lather up at all and it&#x27;s a bit greasy, so doesn&#x27;t rinse off very well. The residue it leaves behind makes my face feel like I never washed it, so I always end up washing my face again after the fact with bar soap. Not the greatest product ever made.</li>
    <li> I love this facewash. It is very creamy and is as nice to use as much more expensive alaternatives.</li>
    <li> Day 2 and face feels so soft!</li>
    <li> At first I was unsure of how my skin was going to react with this new product but once I started using this, in which I mixed with another product called (Anshea) and scrubbed with a facial brush, I started seeing results within the first week and my skin abrasion was diminishing completely, I almost cannot even see it now and its been about 3 weeks....I was very shocked at this because not even Proactive Solution which I have used for well over a year could get rid of my scar...So I will definitely recommend this product to everyone out there that is going through the same situation....</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product and it made my face feel moisturized even after washing but I had to return it due to the fact that it barely washed my make-up off (I only wear Bare Minerals...nothing heavy). It also left a greasy residue on my Olay Pro-X face brush. I would recommend the Pineapple Enzyme face wash from the same company (Alba)...it&#x27;s not greasy, removes ALL my make-up and keeps my face brush nice and clean so I&#x27;m sticking with that!</li>
    <li> I have bought this cleanser a number of times. It works wonderful on sensitive skin. It smells nice and has a creamy texture.</li>
    <li> The smoothest face wash EVER!</li>
    <li> I have oily skin that needs moisture. This made my face feel even worse on both counts. I only gave it two stars for the slightly pleasant tingle. I purchased this at my local walmart, and I feel pretty ripped off for shelling out $10.</li>
    <li> I use this on my body during the winter helps dry skin -- its also great for sensitive skin and i love the smell</li>
    <li> I have used this for a few years.  Excellent for people with sensitive or dry skin. No surfactants or other harsh ingredients. A little goes a long way. Smells great and great price.</li>
    <li> Awesome cleaning product!</li>
    <li> PROS&lt;br /&gt;-smells good. But, it smells more like ginger than coconut&lt;br /&gt;-you don&#x27;t have to use that much, so it will last a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;-does not lather. Feels like you&#x27;re trying to wash your face with lotion&lt;br /&gt;-has alcohol listed as the 2nd ingredient ( not good)&lt;br /&gt;-does not wash off makeup (so it makes me feel like its not washing my face enough)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> Non-drying, doesn&#x27;t make suds, but is so soft and face feels very clean after using it.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product. It cleans effectively, has a clean, sweet fragrance, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and removes waterproof mascara well.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Cannot find it locally anymore.  My entire family purchases this product.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this works perfectly for it. My skin has improved sense buying this and WILL repurchase. Not to mention, it smells amazing. I recommend it to anyone who has a ph balance problem, has dry skin, or sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this, it is hard to find an affordable nonfoaming facial wash. I was.using a much more expensive facial milk and this cleans just as well. My skin feels very moisturized after I use it and I haven&#x27;t had any irritation.</li>
    <li> It arrived and was frozen because of the temperatures but it cleans make up off the face well and it was worth the price I paid.</li>
    <li> Great facial cleanser. No soap good clean ingredients. I Will repurchase. Also purchased their coconut version.  Like that too :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it on my face.I was walking by the aisle for a face wash for my sensitive skin.I didn&#x27;t like it on my face.But had a thought came into my head,maybe try it for removing my mascara?And Yes Yes! It worked!An I use the waterproof type.It came right off without any lashes coming off.Like many other waterproof eye makeup removers I&#x27;ve tried.It&#x27;s gentle,tingle-ly type of feeling,moisturizing.The only down side is you have to wash it thoroughly.It is a must for every woman and girl that use mascara.I will always carry it in my cabinet,so please Alba don&#x27;t discontinue.I&#x27;m soo in love!</li>
    <li> Love this face wash. Very gentle a soothing!</li>
    <li> My skin loves this non-foaming wash.  It&#x27;s creamy with a mild scent and leaves my skin clean without being tight.  I love this all year round, but can&#x27;t really use anything else in the winter when it&#x27;s so dry and the heat is always on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as my daily cleanser for about a month now, but I&#x27;ve waited to write a review to make sure that I&#x27;m happy with it.  For the past few years, I&#x27;d been using a Neutrogena cleanser that I really liked, but I&#x27;ve been trying to move away from products with parabens in them.  I&#x27;ve always loved Alba Bontanica&#x27;s products, so I decided to try it, and I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t burn or leave any redness on my rosacea-prone skin.  The scent is light and smells faintly of coconuts.  Since it&#x27;s a \\&quot;milk,\\&quot; it has a nice thickness to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It removes makeup, and I can even use it on my eyes to get off the residues of my eye makeup (after using my separate eye makeup remover).  It doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes or leave a foggy residue on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a five-star product for sure!</li>
    <li> Great all-natural face wash. I have very sensitive skin and this is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I have used the pineapple face wash in the past and loved it! So, I thought I&#x27;d try this one too, and I love it just as much! It is creamy and slightly smells like peppermint, and leaves my skin feeling so fresh and soft. The pineapple wash was slightly drying, perfect for summer, and this one is perfect for the drier winter months.</li>
    <li> I always support cruelty free skin cares products, this is the first time for me to use Alba Botanica facial wash product, it smells great and has smooth texture, I use it once daily and my skin feels great, love it!</li>
    <li> I use alba face lotion and it&#x27;s the only lotion I live! Decided to give this alba product a shot and liked the idea of a milky face wash. I&#x27;m impressed. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, doesn&#x27;t leave skin greasy, haven&#x27;t broken out from it. Very pleased! I love alba! Fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> So soft and smooth! I feel like my face is getting a real treat from using this, it&#x27;s so natural and kind to my skin.</li>
    <li> i have sensitive skin and am always trying things that aren&#x27;t greasy, rinse off completely. don&#x27;t irritate. and doesn&#x27;t clog pores. This is fantastic. there is a slight menthol smell to it mixed with the cocnut. i thought that was weird but it works great</li>
    <li> great price online &amp; Alba does not test on animals ... gentle and effective</li>
    <li> Felt weird at first since it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s cleaning... but it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my face clean but not dry. It was what I was looking for. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> This is my go to to get makeup of my face, if I need to touch up eye makeup I just put a little on a q-tip and do a quick wipe off...so great!!!</li>
    <li> Kind of has a weird smell and does not clean well. My daughter has complained about it stinging her face occasionally. I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> It feels strange at first because it doesn&#x27;t lather like most soaps I&#x27;ve used, but it leaves my skin feeling clean and moisturized like no other soap does. I haven&#x27;t had to even put on lotion like I normally do. My skin, which is usually sensitive and very prone to acne because of genetics, feels super soft and amazing after using this.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use it for as long as it works for me, but right now it&#x27;s working really great-- better than soaps I&#x27;ve used that were three times the price.</li>
    <li> Having been using this for a long while.  Easy and gentle.  Even a boy likes to use to clean his little face.  Feeling fresh after washing my face in the morning and before the bed time.</li>
    <li> I use only Alba products and this is a great facewash!</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser! Makes my skin feel soft without the greasiness!</li>
    <li> So disappointing that Alba has changed this product.  It used to be a very gentle facial wash that my skin LOVED.  Now it&#x27;s a Deep Cleansing wash, with 3 of the first 4 ingredients as alcohol or acid.  Awful, and the opposite of what my skin needs.  I wish they would have kept the old kind, and made this one look different.  I accidentally purchased it without seeing the difference (thinking it was just a package re-design).  I won&#x27;t make that mistake again...</li>
    <li> Seller delivered on time as promised.  Great product, doesn&#x27;t dry out skin.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product in stores for years and loved it. However, the product has changed. The product I received is different that what is pictured. The bottle I received does say \\&quot;facial wash\\&quot;, but it also says \\&quot;New Look\\&quot; and \\&quot;deep cleansing\\&quot;. The first ingredient is water and the second is alcohol! The fourth ingredient is another alcohol! Also, the fragrance is unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company contact has also changed. Perhaps Alba was recently purchased?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you were looking for Alba&#x27;s gentle face wash, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00120U5E8 ALBA BOTANICA, Hawaiian Coconut Milk Facial Wash - 8 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;Works really good. I have eczema on my face and I could tell it was working when it started tingling. I thought it had tea tree oil in it by the way it smells but I guess it doesn&#x27;t. It is very thick and so it doesn&#x27;t suds up when you start washing your face with it. It really did make a difference in my skin condition, I noticed the little bumps from eczema started to go away.</li>
