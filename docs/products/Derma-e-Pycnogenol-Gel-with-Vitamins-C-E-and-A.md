      <li>Its great worked fast</li>
      <li>also I ended up sending some home with her and will have to order more.</li>
      <li>Natural ingredients that are good for my skin!</li>
      <li>As with many brands of moisturizers, it helps to go easy on the application.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I have had good results as described and love that this is a more natural, earth and animal friendly product.</li>
      <li>It absorbs very quickly and makes your face feel hydrated.  </li>
      <li>I am 37 but still have oily skin that breaks out easily and gets irritated easily too.</li>
      <li>/&gt;3.I went through my jar very quickly.</li>
      <li>But if I can taste the cream so strongly after applying it to my skin, that it makes me nervous.  </li>
      <li>HAVENT SEEN ANY REMARKABLE RESULTS THUS FAR.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty awesome especially if you leave it in the fridge.</li>
      <li>I also have some dehydration on cheeks and fine lines around eyes and forehead.</li>
      <li>I got this after a dr Oz show I saw I love the stuff not greasy absorbs in to skin quickly and reduces wrinkles I got 2</li>
      <li>I live in Florida where it is warm most of the year, and I use this every day.  </li>
      <li>goes on smooth and stays hydrated all day (no stickiness, breathable, no pore</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very hydrating, has a nice cooling effect and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy.</li>
      <li>Ive been using it after applying the Derma E Beauty AHA Beauty Fluid and they go great together.</li>
      <li>Works great after a moderate peel or exfoliation.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is light and absorbs into your face leaving no oily residue.  </li>
      <li>light smell to almost none at all.  </li>
      <li>This product is light, almost watery in its texture but makes my skin feel smooth and hydrated but not greasy at all.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
      <li>IT FEELS GOING ON - COOL, GREASELESS, MOISTURINZING, BUT</li>
      <li>Derma e Pycnogenol Moisturizing Gel is the BEST moisturizer I have found for daily use (for night, I use a different Derma e product).  </li>
      <li>This is a great product, much better than ANY Department store or private salon product I have ever used, especially considering the price.</li>
      <li>Apply liberally and then rinse lightly with cool water and let skin dry on it&#x27;s own (A tip from an esthetician).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
      <li>It is light, it absorbs quickly and with regular use, skin surface improves - skin becomes clearer, firmer and more radiant.</li>
      <li>I have been using this for years and get many compliments on my skin even though I am 73 years old.</li>
      <li>This was the only product that I liked and felt it did what Derma E said it would do.  </li>
      <li>i have sensitive (mostly oily) combo skin.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t help to tighten the skin, but my upper lids and under the eyes feel wonderfully hydrated without the heaviness of other</li>
      <li>I can normally smell products that say they are fragrance free and this one has no smell at all.</li>
      <li>I could overlook this if I thought Derma e&#x27;s Pycnogenol Gel was an excellent product, even mediocre,</li>
      <li>I noticed it immediately with the first application.  </li>
      <li>My skin does feel much firmer and, I have noticed a distinct improvement in my skin tone.</li>
      <li>So perhaps I need to be more vigilant with my overall skin care routine and can continue with the gel.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Living in a 24 hours-7 days a week-hot/humid climate, this is exactly what my skin needs.</li>
      <li>For more than two years, I had horribly dry skin on my face.</li>
      <li>I found:&lt;br /&gt;1.The gel can leave you looking and feeling a little sticky if you use it too much on it&#x27;s own.</li>
      <li>I use proper exfoliation and light peels etc.</li>
      <li>Please scrap this whole product line Derma e.  </li>
      <li>especially appreciate how light it is in the &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>This product will get tacky if you use too much, so it might take some experimentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>The bottom line is this, there must be more research done into Pycnogenol before you claim it was the next natural beauty revival product.  </li>
      <li>The first couple of days I was pleased with this gel: Just a small amount goes a long way and it is indeed very light.</li>
      <li>The moisturizer goes on easy and dry fast.</li>
      <li>Basically, if I blend this gel with other products -- I get better looking results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This gel gets me through the harshest winters and the most sweltering summers while toning down the red and keeping my skin calm.  </li>
      <li>I have aging, sensitive, somewhat oily skin (T-Zone) and most day moisturizers are to heavy and aggravate my skin</li>
      <li>Then I started to notice tiny zits, first on my forehead, then on cheeks and chin, and my rosacea became aggravated.</li>
      <li>In the warmer months, so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Yuck! I am throwing this away. Leaves my face feeling taught but sticky and stiff as if I had painted egg whites on it…I wonder if this is what Botox feels like? EWW!</li>
    <li> I have oily skin. This is the best face lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I have aging, sensitive, somewhat oily skin (T-Zone) and most day moisturizers are to heavy and aggravate my skin and I break out.  Derma e Pycnogenol Moisturizing Gel is the BEST moisturizer I have found for daily use (for night, I use a different Derma e product).  It is light, it absorbs quickly and with regular use, skin surface improves - skin becomes clearer, firmer and more radiant.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  For people with oily skin, it is an excellent moisturizer without the greasy feeling.  It absorbs very quickly and makes your face feel hydrated.  It has good ratings on the environmental working group scale of safety for both yourself and the environment.  I have tried many of the products and love the line of skin care.</li>
    <li> My skin is oily and this product soothes it and replenishes it without making me break out.  Love it! I have been using it for about three months.  Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> As with many brands of moisturizers, it helps to go easy on the application. This product will get tacky if you use too much, so it might take some experimentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living in an arid climate, this might not have enough moisture for winter time. In the warmer months, so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s contributed to my hormonal acne, and it helps a bit with the scarring. As far as the anti aging qualities, I&#x27;m not sure, as I use Differin for acne, and that helps plump fine lines.</li>
    <li> I feel my skin much, much better. I&#x27;m going to review the web site of this cream for looking more creams.</li>
    <li> Feels great on the skin. It gives you a cooling sensation once you&#x27;ve applied it, although, I would not recommend using this before applying your makeup.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this product and LOVE IT!!!!  I am 37 but still have oily skin that breaks out easily and gets irritated easily too. I also have some dehydration on cheeks and fine lines around eyes and forehead. This product is light, almost watery in its texture but makes my skin feel smooth and hydrated but not greasy at all. Ive been using it after applying the Derma E Beauty AHA Beauty Fluid and they go great together. This is a great product, much better than ANY Department store or private salon product I have ever used, especially considering the price.IF you have skin like mine, then you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Puchased this because the website stated rhat it was good for oily skin but it didn&#x27;t help and it made my skin feel sticky.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the results of his product, and I will continue to reorder it.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin, so cannot use the regular greasy moisturizers. This stuff is wonderful - no grease, very light and refreshing, easy to put on right after washing up or a shower. I have used it for a year or more. When I stopped using it for a couple of months my skin definitely looked older - I am forty-six. Most of the time people think I am quite a bit younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend anything by Derma-E - they make wonderful products.</li>
    <li> I boought an entire skin regimen line from Derma E.  This was the only product that I liked and felt it did what Derma E said it would do.  Because all of the other products I purchased from this company made my face exta oily (even though I purchased products designed for oily skin) I ended up giving all the products to my daughter hoping they would work better for her.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I know that it says moisturizing, but I use this under my moisturizer, during the day, and by itself at night.&lt;br /&gt;My face seems to be firming, which is what Pycnogenol is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Product feels cool upon application, yet there is a lingering and annoying stickiness.  I could overlook this if I thought Derma e&#x27;s Pycnogenol Gel was an excellent product, even mediocre, but no.  The bottom line is this, there must be more research done into Pycnogenol before you claim it was the next natural beauty revival product.  Maybe it was just my experience but this ingredient did my skin no favors, I ended up with discolorations, dead and dull looking skin.  Kinda how the tree probably looks that this ingredient was extracted from.  I am a man so I kinda liked the idea of using tree bark extract to make my skin look better but it just doesn&#x27;t work out well.  Please scrap this whole product line Derma e.  Everything else is excellent though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.  In the cold winter months my skin tends  to get drier to the point that it sometimes gets flaky.  The problem is I also have to watch it because my skin usually is oily and acne prone.  I can&#x27;t just apply any old moisturizer, because if I do I break out.  But this  moisturizer feels like your skin is soaking it up.  I noticed it immediately with the first application.  It&#x27;s very light in texture, light smell to almost none at all.  No greasy feel either.  I use this in combination with the green tea eye gel and really like it.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use this as my daytime face lotion. I have pretty dry sensitive skin and have not had any problems with this. The texture is very light and thin, my only complaint is that it is not as moisturizing as other products I have used. However, I like this product because it is light and for under makeup it is perfect. This would be a perfect moisturizer for someone with oily skin or if you are just looking for something with a light moisturizing effect.</li>
    <li> I cannot use creams or oils on my face they are too heavy.  This is the only moisturizer I have used for the last 10 years.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> recommended to re leave razor burn and eczema. Its great worked fast</li>
    <li> I live in Florida where it is warm most of the year, and I use this every day.  It is light and absorbs into your face leaving no oily residue.  I have been using this for years and get many compliments on my skin even though I am 73 years old.</li>
    <li> I use the Pycnogenol because it works.  I noticed that it was the main ingredient in the other serum I was using and it is cheaper to buy it this way.  I get lots of compliments on my skin and am always trying to stay young looking.  This get is great.  Takes a few minutes to dry but worth it.  Amazon gets it here on time and as inexpensive as possible. After cancer and chemo and being over mid 60, I am just thankful for the compliments...my skin never missed a beat and this is one of the few things I use.  Always stay natural.</li>
    <li> Happy with this product. Great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> For more than two years, I had horribly dry skin on my face. Seriously, ridiculously dry skin. I would scrub dry flakes off and within a day or two, they&#x27;d be back. I tried moisturizers from the grocery store and very expensive, high-end moisturizers. They helped only slightly, and nothing made the flaking dry skin actually go away. I don&#x27;t know how this stuff works so well, but it completely healed my dry skin. I don&#x27;t have dry flakes at all anymore! Even if I skip a couple of days of use, my skin is still ok. I also have melasma, which is why I bought this to begin with. I only use it once a day, and although I would say there is a slight improvement in tone, it has not cured the melasma. But the vast improvement in my dry skin and skin texture has made me a dedicated user.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer! I&#x27;m 50-something and have used it for 15+ years. It&#x27;s light, absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
    <li> Product is excellent facial antioxidant/moisturizer/age defying gel..especially appreciate how light it is in the &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; weather.&lt;br /&gt;Forms a protective shield on skin ...just love it !!</li>
    <li> Yes, it is a little odd when you first start using it. Some users have equated it to egg whites. That is not my experience. My skin does feel much firmer and, I have noticed a distinct improvement in my skin tone. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Lightweight but effective, good for oily skin</li>
    <li> This is my year round day moisturizer. Only a little is needed and it lasts a long time.  In general, all the Derma-e Pycogenol products for sensitive skin work for me.  I can normally smell products that say they are fragrance free and this one has no smell at all.</li>
    <li> I got this after a dr Oz show I saw I love the stuff not greasy absorbs in to skin quickly and reduces wrinkles I got 2 and when my mom came to visit she fell in love with it also I ended up sending some home with her and will have to order more.</li>
    <li> seems like it was used.  not completely full and no plastic shield covering the cream like derma e usually provides.</li>
    <li> A NECESSITY FOR ONES COMPLEXION</li>
    <li> I buy a lot of the derma e products and this one is not top on my list.  It goes on wonderfully but soon your skin feels dry again.  I wouldn&#x27;t call it a wonderful moisturizer</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this moisturizer. Living in a 24 hours-7 days a week-hot/humid climate, this is exactly what my skin needs. It&#x27;s very hydrating, has a nice cooling effect and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy. It&#x27;s pretty awesome especially if you leave it in the fridge.</li>
    <li> Product not greasy and doesn&#x27;t make my face breakout.  Still looking for a more moisturizing &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This gel gets me through the harshest winters and the most sweltering summers while toning down the red and keeping my skin calm.  Great for acne prone skin or large pores.</li>
    <li> I have have been using derma e pycnogenol gel for years. I don&#x27;t plan to stop. It keeps my face hydrated without feeling sticky.</li>
    <li> I bought this moisturizer due to having rosacea. I have been using Derma E Pycnogenol Soothing Moisturizing Creme for a few years now and it works rather well for me. I was curious about this product and decided to try it too. I can not use it. It is not calming to my skin. In fact, it created a rosacea flare up (skin reddened, itching, burning &amp; bumps). I will stick with the creme.</li>
    <li> I still have my wrinkles, but this moisturizer is not greasy.  I have also used it on area (leg or arm) were there is a break in the skin.  It seems to help.  Maybe in 6 months I can tell if it is working. I have major brown spots on my face from sun bathing when I was a teenager--50 years ago.  So this moisturizer has a lot of work to do.  The moisturizer goes on easy and dry fast.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, acne prone and dehydrated skin -- meaning I lack water and not oil. So oil free is perfect. I have been using this gel moisturizer for about a month now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pros for me:&lt;br /&gt;1. Pycnogenol gel blends wonderfully with my BB creams (or tinted moisturizers) to give added hydration and makes the products much easier to apply. This was a nice surprise. The gel seems to just melt into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Gives my skin a glow, especially under the eyes and when mixed with toner. It doesn&#x27;t help to tighten the skin, but my upper lids and under the eyes feel wonderfully hydrated without the heaviness of other creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It makes a good moisture mask or skin pick me up. Apply liberally and then rinse lightly with cool water and let skin dry on it&#x27;s own (A tip from an esthetician).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Works great after a moderate peel or exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cons I found:&lt;br /&gt;1.The gel can leave you looking and feeling a little sticky if you use it too much on it&#x27;s own. If I blend it in after applying toner, it looks a little less sticky. Basically, if I blend this gel with other products -- I get better looking results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.The gel comes in a jar, which means you add bacteria every time you put your finger in it. And I wash my hands. Not sure why companies still package this way after all the research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.I went through my jar very quickly. So not as cost effective as I&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I break out sporadically and sometimes it&#x27;s severe. I cannot tell if this gel is blocking my pores, but I still break out in patches and have a lot of congestion. This is the biggest possible con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(When I use proper exfoliation and light peels etc. my skin improves. So perhaps I need to be more vigilant with my overall skin care routine and can continue with the gel.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have had good results as described and love that this is a more natural, earth and animal friendly product.</li>
    <li> The Environmental Working Group website (Skin Deep) said that this cream is one of the \\&quot;safer\\&quot; ones to use, in terms of having fewer potentially toxic chemicals in it than other creams do.  But if I can taste the cream so strongly after applying it to my skin, that it makes me nervous.  After using it a couple times, I threw away the rest of the product.</li>
    <li> I am still using this product, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll buy it again. It&#x27;s definitely different from other gel moisturisers I&#x27;ve tried, and I find it dries a little sticky. But my face isn&#x27;t dry, so there&#x27;s that. I&#x27;ll finish out the bottle and then go back to my Origins gel moisturiser .</li>
    <li> I LIKE THE WAY IT FEELS GOING ON - COOL, GREASELESS, MOISTURINZING, BUT HAVENT SEEN ANY REMARKABLE RESULTS THUS FAR.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several derma-e products over the years, and although some work better for me than others, I&#x27;ve never had a bad reaction to any of them. I have combination skin with some rosacea and no acne. I normally use the Pycnogenol Moisturizing Creme, but it can be a little greasy in the eye area. I liked the idea of something truly oil-free and light. The first couple of days I was pleased with this gel: Just a small amount goes a long way and it is indeed very light. Then I started to notice tiny zits, first on my forehead, then on cheeks and chin, and my rosacea became aggravated. I stopped using the product, and within 36 hours the zits and redness were almost gone. Wish I knew which ingredient to blame for this; unfortunately, all I know is that this gel is bad news for me.</li>
    <li> Nice moisturizer that has no grease!  Natural ingredients that are good for my skin!</li>
    <li> The product did not perform according to the listed Vitamin C, E and A; no difference in skin appearance nor feel.</li>
    <li> i finally found my ideal face moisturizer! i have sensitive (mostly oily) combo skin. goes on smooth and stays hydrated all day (no stickiness, breathable, no pore blockage).&lt;br /&gt;the matching eye gel works great as well. very pleased &#x3D;)</li>
