      <li>The color and style is true to the picture.</li>
      <li>Nice soft synthetic hair.</li>
      <li>It gets tangled fast but most wigs do.</li>
      <li>So last night I tried a different outfit and it all looked great together!</li>
      <li>I paid more for my ok looking blonde wig than for this one and this one blows it out of the water!</li>
      <li>I have a decent size head and it fit just fine.</li>
      <li>But I gotta say its pretty dang bomb!</li>
      <li>so I thought a wig would be fun for awhile</li>
      <li>I had a friend of mine try it on and her head is really big (doesn&#x27;t fit most hats)</li>
      <li>I had bought it just for fun</li>
      <li>The wig sheds, first off, and is significantly darker (more of a chocolate brown) than the actual product.</li>
      <li>Smooth soft, bouncy curls with a great colorful subtle blend of mixed light brown tones!  </li>
      <li>First of all I can&#x27;t believe how fast  the shipping was from China!</li>

      <li>The color and style pretty much as described.</li>
      <li>The wig itself is very well made.</li>
      <li>I like the style, and the wig came from China, but arrived in a reasonable amount of time.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s really wearable.</li>
      <li>Not even worth the low price!</li>
      <li>The ends are not curly and the hair is very thin but quality and softness of the wig is very good and comes with a netted wig cap (it&#x27;s a tad small, but that can easily be solved by stretching the cap out)</li>
      <li>Very short not much you can do with it in terms of styling but the quality is fine for the price</li>
      <li>I was surprised that they could sell a wig for this price</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize this wig was coming directly from China when I bought it</li>
      <li>I arrived a full two weeks earlier than I expected.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> A word to the wise, the shipping on this product is kinda wierd. They estimated its arrival about 4-6 weeks after the day my order was processed, but the wig arrived within 2 1/2 weeks from my process date. So the shipping is fair. The wig came exactly how it looks in the picture. Please understand though, the lighting in your home may affect the way the color looks but rest assured that the product is the exact color stated. I ordered this wig and another wig from this company and this one is my favorite. It does shed quite a bit so refrain from heavy brushing/combing. Invest in some wig detangler too as it can get a little tangled but a little finger combing and detangler will fix it right up. I really do recommend this wig to anyone who is interested. So dont hesitate, just order it. You can&#x27;t beat the price compared to going to a wig shop!</li>
    <li> The wig sheds, first off, and is significantly darker (more of a chocolate brown) than the actual product. The ends are not curly and the hair is very thin but quality and softness of the wig is very good and comes with a netted wig cap (it&#x27;s a tad small, but that can easily be solved by stretching the cap out) it&#x27;s a nice starter wig, and good quality.</li>
    <li> First of all I can&#x27;t believe how fast  the shipping was from China! I arrived a full two weeks earlier than I expected. I have experience ordering wigs and clothes from China so this was a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was a bit disappointed by this wig. It was a bit shorter than I realized (my fault for not paying attention), and I felt it made me look like a soccer mom! That was also my fault and just required a different outfit pairing. So last night I tried a different outfit and it all looked great together! I felt so very cute and sexy all at once. My girlfriend loved it on me as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wig is great for guys who like to occasionally embrace their feminine side like me, and for girls who want something fun and flirty. One day I may upgrade to a human hair, expensive wig. For now these do just fine and the price is amazing! Also I found a video that tells you how to detangle synthetic wigs with Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson No More Tangles spray. Just look up Abby Dark Star on YouTube. She does awesome cosplay and has plenty of experience with wigs.</li>
    <li> If I had to say, this item met the description, but the quality is not that good. The hair is thin and uneven, even when attempting to style. Nothing like the picture except it is short, has bangs, and is brown.</li>
    <li> Great for a gal who is on the go constantly and wants to look good while doing so.  Smooth soft, bouncy curls with a great colorful subtle blend of mixed light brown tones!  Shipped quick!</li>
    <li> Cute wig. Obviously not high quality as per the price. Sheds hair. The color and style pretty much as described. I have not tried to wash it.</li>
    <li> for the price of the wig; it&#x27;s really good. I have no complaints. the wig cap fits my head; not always the case when they come from overseas. it looks just like the picture.</li>
    <li> Its just okay. Very short not much you can do with it in terms of styling but the quality is fine for the price</li>
    <li> Very thin and stringy. Not a wig I wear often.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t come with a way to attach to your head.  Won&#x27;t stay on.  Hair keeps falling out.  Not even worth the low price!</li>
    <li> came with quite a few knots, but once removed, it looks fairly decent</li>
    <li> Look just like the picture.  Great value for the money.  It&#x27;s the first wig I have ever purchased so I wanted to try something inexpensive,  it&#x27;s a quick and easy way to change your look.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a wig before. I&#x27;ve actually never even tried on a wig before. But when I saw this I had to get it! I&#x27;ve always wanted to style my hair this way so getting the wig was a perfect way to try the style without committing. The delivery took a few weeks, but it came in perfect condition. It looks great and felt ok on. They even sent a free hair cap with the wig!  I don&#x27;t have any other wig experience to compare this with, but to me this is a great product for the price!</li>
    <li> I was father sceptical of this wig based on the price. But I gotta say its pretty dang bomb! I paid more for my ok looking blonde wig than for this one and this one blows it out of the water! It doesn&#x27;t have the weird wig smell, it barely has a shine to it and its super soft (feels like real hair), and it&#x27;s rather full. It gets tangled fast but most wigs do. Just invest in a $3 wig comb and you&#x27;re set. I have a decent size head and it fit just fine. I had a friend of mine try it on and her head is really big (doesn&#x27;t fit most hats) and it fit fairly well for her, but not as good as for me. The color and style is true to the picture. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased! I love it!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this wig was coming directly from China when I bought it but after I bought it I received an email from overseas.  I bought the wig on Dec 4th for Christmas Party, but they told me in the email it wouldn&#x27;t arrive until January 2013 some time which was upsetting so I went and bought a wig locally.  Then it ended up arriving in time.  Go figure.  I had a lot of fun with the wig, it fit nicely and I wore it daily for a month.  I was trying to grow my hair out so I thought a wig would be fun for awhile and it sure was.</li>
    <li> I was surprised that they could sell a wig for this price and it&#x27;s a lot nicer than I expected. I had bought it just for fun but it&#x27;s really wearable. Nice soft synthetic hair.</li>
    <li> Awesome delivery, Highly recommend !</li>
    <li> the wig is great, fit good and looks go didn&#x27;t take much to get it ready.</li>
    <li> great service love the color fits great</li>
    <li> The wig texture is great.  The color is pretty. I like the style, and the wig came from China, but arrived in a reasonable amount of time.  I am a satisified customer.</li>
    <li> The hair is so nice and soft! The wig itself is very well made.</li>
