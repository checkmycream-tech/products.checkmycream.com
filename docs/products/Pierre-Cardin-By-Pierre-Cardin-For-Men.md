### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and I was very happy with it.</li>
      <li>The product is great</li>
      <li>I have always liked Pierre Cardin&#x27;s scent.  </li>
      <li>Although a bit dated, it is still a refreshing scent.  </li>
      <li>Got a couple of bottles for my grandfather as its his favorite cologne - he&#x27;s been wearing the stuff for close to 40 years.</li>
      <li>I love this smell on my husband and he loves it also</li>
      <li>Favorite scent.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Original scent.</li>
      <li>Nice but TOO OLD SCHOOL.</li>
      <li>a small bottle doesn&#x27;t break the bank like many of today&#x27;s more popular brands do.</li>
      <li>Cologne arrived safely, was packed with extra bubble wrap, and is now safely sitting on my grandfathers dresser.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s close enough though that I still compliment my husband on how nice he smells when wearing it.  </li>
      <li>It last all day and it&#x27;s for a great low price.</li>
      <li>What I love about my choices is you can smell all of them and they all smell completely different.</li>
      <li>I used to use this product 20 years ago very hard to find here in West Texas, brings back a lot of wonderful memories.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t beat the price, fast shipping</li>
      <li>And the seal around this cheap knock off version of the Cologne had allowed 95% of the bottle to leaked out prior to us receiving it</li>
      <li>and I really like having this one on.</li>
      <li>It also needs to be applied with care, if just the slightest bit too much is sprayed on, it can be overpowering.  </li>
      <li>Really was looking for the musk.</li>
      <li>It was one of the first colognes I bought my husband in the 80s simply because I liked its soft, unassuming yet very romantic smell.  </li>
      <li>Most modern cologne all starts to smell like alcohol after a back to back sniff.</li>
      <li>a more serious note, Amazon provides a great portal to get these hard to find type goods.</li>
      <li>Why four stars, like I said it is dated and too powerful for daily use.</li>
      <li>It is not bad, but is really not the same as the cologne (after shave) by the same name that I have used for many years.  </li>
      <li>This bottle last me more than 3 months because I also use other colognes and perfumes.</li>
      <li>Dad likes this since I was little, I wanted to bring back memories for him and it worked :) he still likes it.</li>
      <li>At 53 I still wear the old classics.....</li>
      <li>The prices are good at Amazon and you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
      <li>This product does not smell more than 30 minutes, it&#x27;s not a good product.</li>
      <li>I have had the real cologne, this is not it by a long shot!</li>
      <li>I wonder if the original scent has been played with because lately Pierre Cardin doesn&#x27;t smell exactly the same as it did way back when.  </li>

<li> I use Pierre Cardin as an occasional departure from the everyday.  </li>
<li> You see, you order,  and receive what you expected.  </li>
<li> This was my cologne choice back in the late 70&#x27;s and its been a long time since I&#x27;ve worn it.</li>
<li> Also I was not aware (could by my inattention to detail), that it in a was a spray bottle.</li>
<li> Other mens&#x27; colognes come and go at our house, but there is always a bottle of Pierre Cardin sitting on the bathroom shelf.  </li>
<li> Not real at all!</li>
<li> The product was received soon after ordering and the price was less then competitors.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27; waste your money on this product.  </li>
<li> How can you go wrong ?    </li>
<li> the item we received was a fake knock off of the Cologne we paid for.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> At 53 I still wear the old classics.....Aramis, Devin (Aramis&#x27;s country cologne), Halston Z14 and Pierre Cardin. What I love about my choices is you can smell all of them and they all smell completely different. Most modern cologne all starts to smell like alcohol after a back to back sniff. Not with these 4.</li>
    <li> The product was received soon after ordering and the price was less then competitors.  How can you go wrong ?    Larry</li>
    <li> You see, you order,  and receive what you expected.  It&#x27;s how it should be and how it was for me.</li>
    <li> Got a couple of bottles for my grandfather as its his favorite cologne - he&#x27;s been wearing the stuff for close to 40 years. I figure I can stock up on the stuff for him and save myself the embarrassment of picking up the bottles at my local CVS/Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a more serious note, Amazon provides a great portal to get these hard to find type goods. Cologne arrived safely, was packed with extra bubble wrap, and is now safely sitting on my grandfathers dresser.</li>
    <li> Favorite scent.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Not real at all! Go to Dillard&#x27; and buy it, Don&#x27; waste your money on this product.  I have had the real cologne, this is not it by a long shot!</li>
    <li> I love this smell on my husband and he loves it also</li>
    <li> Really was looking for the musk.</li>
    <li> Original scent. It last all day and it&#x27;s for a great low price. This bottle last me more than 3 months because I also use other colognes and perfumes.</li>
    <li> Although a bit dated, it is still a refreshing scent.  It also needs to be applied with care, if just the slightest bit too much is sprayed on, it can be overpowering.  For daily use I go for Calvin Klein&#x27;s offerings, Eternity for Men being my preference.  I use Pierre Cardin as an occasional departure from the everyday.  Why four stars, like I said it is dated and too powerful for daily use.</li>
    <li> the item we received was a fake knock off of the Cologne we paid for. And the seal around this cheap knock off version of the Cologne had allowed 95% of the bottle to leaked out prior to us receiving it</li>
    <li> This product does not smell more than 30 minutes, it&#x27;s not a good product. I&#x27;ve always used this fragrance and the smell lasted several days, seems to have degraded the quality.</li>
    <li> It is not bad, but is really not the same as the cologne (after shave) by the same name that I have used for many years.  Also I was not aware (could by my inattention to detail), that it in a was a spray bottle.</li>
    <li> This was my cologne choice back in the late 70&#x27;s and its been a long time since I&#x27;ve worn it. To me it has a spicy scent that invigorates me. Cologne is a personal choice and I really like having this one on.</li>
    <li> Dad likes this since I was little, I wanted to bring back memories for him and it worked :) he still likes it.</li>
    <li> I used to use this product 20 years ago very hard to find here in West Texas, brings back a lot of wonderful memories.</li>
    <li> Can you smell me now?</li>
    <li> Nice but TOO OLD SCHOOL.</li>
    <li> The product is great and I was very happy with it. I would buy it again and again without any problem. The prices are good at Amazon and you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t beat the price, fast shipping</li>
    <li> I have always liked Pierre Cardin&#x27;s scent.  It was one of the first colognes I bought my husband in the 80s simply because I liked its soft, unassuming yet very romantic smell.

It&#x27;s close enough though that I still compliment my husband on how nice he smells when wearing it.  An added bonus--a small bottle doesn&#x27;t break the bank like many of today&#x27;s more popular brands do.</li>
