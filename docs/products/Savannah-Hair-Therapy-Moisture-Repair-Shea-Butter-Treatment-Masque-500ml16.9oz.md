<li> I highly recommend it especially if your hair is damaged.</li>
<li> I have processed hair and it would always break off and now it barely does.</li>
<li> This stuff is SO concentrated that a little bit really does go a long way.</li>
<li> It will last you a long time.</li>
<li> I have put it in my hair then put my hair up and left it in for as long as two days.  </li>
<li> I leave it in my hair  all day and wash it out the day after and flat iron it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had this product for like 7-8 months, have very long hair, and still have 75% of the jar left.</li>
<li> I use this product 2-3 times a week just on my ends and they feel soft and break a lot less.</li>
<li> I have long straight thick hair that gets tangled all the time and this one smoothes it out and helps my hair not to tangle.  </li>
<li> I have really long hair, and this keeps my hair hydrated!</li>
<li> I would imagine if you use too much it will weigh your hair down so start small.</li>
<li> I am not sure if I would get it again, as I have super thick hair and it seems to take a lot of the product to get the results I want.</li>
<li> This is an out-of-this-world hair product,&lt;br /&gt;especially for dry damaged hair!  </li>
<li> and it can get very dry.</li>
<li> Only need to use a little bit and works wonders.  </li>
<li> I will order it again and check out the other Savannah products as well.</li>
<li> This product is not worth</li>
<li> Even my thin hair now has shine and over bleached hair looks alive.</li>
<li> just a little is all you need.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
<li> I use it as an everyday conditioner or a 20min treatment uner a dryer.</li>
<li> I have used it in the past</li>
<li> Once a week I put a small amount of this on my ends, work it up to my roots, let it set for 5-10 minutes, and rinse it out.</li>
<li> and then I went home with a small sample packet.</li>
<li> Use it at least once a week.</li>
<li> I hated paying so much</li>

You can use a bit as a routine conditioner if you&#x27;d like but to me it feels like a more luxurious conditioner so I like to use it once a week or two, leave it on to condition for a while then rinse. FragranceNet.com are also awesome. i&#x27;ll definitely be ordering from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this conditioner and I absolutely love it.  While I am in the shower I leave it on for 5 mins or longer while massage my hair.  Then I  comb it out so easily,.  My hair feels soft, silky,  luxurious.  I will definitely purchase again.  I am a fan!</li>
    <li> I have course and curly hair.  It nourishes my hair to leave it silky.  Really nice and esy to use.</li>
    <li> This is an out-of-this-world hair product,&lt;br /&gt;especially for dry damaged hair!  I recovered my healthy hair look after only one try. :)&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this product again and again!</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever ! Makes my hair so soft and manageable! I will never buy another conditioner ever again. I have processed hair and it would always break off and now it barely does.</li>

    <li> This product is not worth it&#x27;s money. My hair is still dry, frizzy and fly away!!!!  Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
    <li> I WAS SOOOOOO HAPPY TO SEE THIS ON AMAZON!  I originally bought at my hairdresser for 75.00 - part of their deal though was that I could bring it in anytime and sit under the dryer with it to get a deep treatment.  I hated paying so much but it was such a great product and I actually bought it twice from them.  It smells great- feels great- and leaves your hair both soft and smelling great.  I have fine hair and its still good for me. I use once or twice a week…. just a little is all you need.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff smells so good, makes my hair feeling amazing</li>
    <li> A hair stylist in NYC recommended this to me. I dye my hair platinum blond and it can get very dry. Once a week I put a small amount of this on my ends, work it up to my roots, let it set for 5-10 minutes, and rinse it out. My hair feels absolutely wonderful after that. I would imagine if you use too much it will weigh your hair down so start small. I&#x27;ve had this product for like 7-8 months, have very long hair, and still have 75% of the jar left. So it&#x27;s totally worth the price. It will last you a long time.</li>
    <li> Smells great.  Love my hair after I&#x27;ve left this on for a while.  I use it about every 2 weeks. Smoooth stuff!</li>
    <li> Best for repairing dry, damaged hair. Leaves hair clean and shinny. My hair texture is fine and it was not greasy or weighed down. Loved this product!!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. Even my thin hair now has shine and over bleached hair looks alive. It smells delicious.I bought the small 8 ounce container for $30 at my hairdresser and this was a great bargain on Amazon</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have really long hair, and this keeps my hair hydrated! Love love love.</li>
    <li> Amazing conditioner. I use it as an everyday conditioner or a 20min treatment uner a dryer. I would buy this from.now on.</li>
    <li> Such a amazing product makes my dry damaged hair feel so soft and it reduces my split ends. Definitely worth the money</li>
    <li> I use it as Hair conditioner. It leaves my hair shiny and it smells great! I have used it in the past and I was happy to have found it in Amazon.  I highly recommend it especially if your hair is damaged. You do not need to use a lot, massage it  into your scalp and leave it in for 5 minutes. Use it at least once a week. It works wonders.</li>
    <li> Been Using this conditioner for 2 years already and there&#x27;s nothing else like it. I&#x27;ve been through a lot of trial and error with my hair and I use this religiously.I leave it in my hair  all day and wash it out the day after and flat iron it. I even use it during the day when i twist my hair it holds it pretty good. Didn&#x27;t go to the salon for 8 months and when I went back she said that my hair has never looked healthier and that I didn&#x27;t even need a trim. Best thing about it is that this container last me the whole year. Completely changed my hair and believe me cause I have that &amp;#34;Diana Ross hair&amp;#34;.Thank god I found this</li>
