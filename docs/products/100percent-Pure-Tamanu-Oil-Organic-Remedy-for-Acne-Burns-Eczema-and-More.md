      <li>I put on at night and in morning, all better!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d wake up, look in the mirror, and believe you me that after about 2 weeks my skin looked more supple, clean, youthful and was not oily at all!!!</li>
      <li>What kind of dimension is that???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>To top it off, I couldn&#x27;t even get it all out of the container because it crystallized in the bottom and is not pourable, so</li>
      <li>, many people have been upset at the size of the bottle.</li>
      <li>Then the magic happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product  is  excellent for moisturizing my skin especially when exposed to alot of sun.</li>
      <li>YOUR MONEY and get a better value and quality product ELSEWHERE.</li>
      <li>I am also enjoying healthier-looking skin.</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s organic - so much better than chemical-filled products.</li>
      <li>After hearing the superb reviews on Dr. Oz, I finally took the bait.</li>
      <li>I love Queen Bee&#x27;s Tamanu Oil.  </li>
      <li>The deeper crows feet and smile lines now look visibly reduced and my skin is softer, more glowy (is this even a word?!)</li>
      <li>bottle may contain pure Tamanu oil (although my trust in this company is hanging by a spider&#x27;s thread at this point so I wouldn&#x27;t bet on it) and that oil may be of good quality.  </li>
      <li>She recommended this because I was trying to get rid of my light acne scarring and wanted a preventative to help keep me from getting more.</li>
      <li>There are too many other companies out there with honest descriptions and good quality products.</li>
      <li>The best things in life come in small packages:)</li>
      <li>so light.</li>
      <li>Buy and you will love, totally worth the price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had any company go to such an extend to make a customer happy.</li>
      <li>after the fact of course.&lt;br /&gt;It gives you &amp;#34;product dimensions&amp;#34; and shows you this bottle next to a sheet of paper - so you assume that you&#x27;re getting an excellent value and the bottle will be of a decent size.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The mixture was really absorbed into my skin and if I felt it still a bit oilier than I liked, I&#x27;d blot any oiliness with a soft tissue paper.</li>
      <li>Once dry,  I&#x27;d mix equal parts of organic jojoba oil and nighttime skin cream with 1drop of grapefruit EO (to aid in lightening the hyperpigmentation AND the smell is wonderful!)</li>
      <li>This product packs a powerful punch.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the dollars.</li>
      <li>Put it on my eczema and could feel it working right away.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for healing and excessive dryness.</li>
      <li>Only a very little is required and best used at night.  </li>
      <li>you notice that NO WHERE does it state how many oz of actual oil you get?</li>
      <li>This is the first product I found that even seemed to make a difference.</li>
      <li>First I will explain how I use it</li>
      <li>After rubbing my palms together I&#x27;d gently glide this mixture all over my face (excluding the eye area), neck, the back of my neck to the top of my shoulders and of course my décolleté.</li>
      <li>100% Pure Tamanu Oil just arrived and I have not had time to use it yet.</li>
      <li>There are a lot of organic ingredients/products out there that claim to fix certain problems.</li>
      <li>I basically paid the same price as I would at my health food store, where they have a huge overhead</li>
      <li>I bought this a few weeks ago and it is amazing.</li>
      <li>To me, all these oils smell and feel like they are mixed with some cheap oil on the market..</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even know if its really 100%</li>
      <li>We use it on our hands after a weekend of skiing when they get really chapped and in the summer for sunburn.</li>
      <li>I think it is very well priced for what it does for your skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>You do not need much of a large amount for a high quality item and is certainly that.  </li>
      <li>So pretty and clear!</li>
      <li>the quality of the oil is good but far too small of a quantity for the price.</li>
      <li>Once again we are being mislead by clever word usage.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t help with my current condition, but was worth a shot.</li>
      <li>Queen Bee is very clearly using intentionally misleading figures here to misrepresent the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware of the actual size of the container I had ordered - but I must say it is miniscule.</li>
      <li>This product is of the highest quality and does not require much quantity for proper usage.  </li>
      <li>Bought to treat adult acne but had no effect on it.</li>
      <li>My two year old daughter was experiencing difficulty with ingrown  toenails.  </li>
      <li>I have tried alot of different creams that never seemed to do anything, but the Tamanu Oil really did the trick.  </li>
      <li>I do put on a surgical scar that is 2 years old, and seems to be helping with that too</li>
      <li>I started to notice that my skin got very fine little bumps in the places I was using the Tamanu oil, making my skin look and feel rough.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s more of a sample size, but a little goes a very long way!</li>
      <li>It reduces the redness and helps my skin to get back to normal.  </li>
      <li>I have psoriasis and this helps to calm my skin down.  </li>
      <li>My skin is also pretty sensitive so that could be a factor, but it takes weeks for those little bumps to go away, so I&#x27;ve learned to us</li>
      <li>The only bottles I&#x27;ve ever seen that are any smaller than this are perfume testers, and they are not smaller by very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is true that it&#x27;s small</li>
      <li>Organic Cuticle Oil, my daughter&#x27;s toes have been prescription free for over the last year and a half!!  </li>
      <li>I have use Tamanu oil and mixed it with a a little Aloe and it heals the burns very fast and without any scars.</li>

<li> /&gt;This is clearly not a description of the bottle.  </li>
<li> As some other reviewers have noted, this product comes in a tiny bottle wrapped in bubble wrap and delivered in a manila envelope.</li>
<li> Pure Tamanu oil in my local health food store before making this purchase, and the bottle they had was AT LEAST twice this size, if not more, and it was selling for about $22.  </li>
<li> will probably keep this bottle only because it&#x27;s too much trouble to return it, but I will be contacting Amazon about this, and</li>
<li> wish i had read the other reviews 1st.</li>
<li> Do your homework carefully!  </li>
<li> I started using this oil as spot treatment on my acne after I went to Queen Bee this past summer and had a facial.</li>
<li> I usually shake the bottle, take off the cap and dip my finger in the left over oil on the cap, which is plenty for me.</li>
<li> However, the other Tamanu oils on amazon ARE 100% Tamanu Oil.</li>
<li> I thought, \\&quot;Perhaps the other Tamanu Oils sold for $13 per ounce are not 100%.\\&quot;</li>
<li> use small tiny miniscule vial</li>
<li> for such a small amount.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way!!</li>
<li> Usually when I buy supplements and healthcare products from Amazon, the price is roughly half of what I would pay in my local health food store.  </li>
<li> Id been taken &amp; felt stupid for not doing more research first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> not worth the troubke to order them</li>
<li> They are using the word organic in a different context here, to mean that it is derived from a plant.</li>
<li> and that&#x27;s not cool.  </li>
<li> Tamanu is a dark spot ERASER!</li>
<li> I don’t care just DON’T waste your money on this one time</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve purchased this tamanu oil a few times because I always like to keep it around the house for when we have skin issues.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, buy your oil from:&lt;br /&gt;California</li>
<li> I then began adding Tamanu to my morning routine after substituting lavender EO for the grapefruit EO (thus avoiding slight  photosensitivity!).</li>
<li> After combining LESS THAN a PEA size amount of the Queen Bee Tamanu and topping it off with the Queen Bee Bee Nuts!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very thick and it stays on the skin for a long time.</li>
<li> My son has typical teenage skin, and it looked sad.</li>
<li> Am anxious to try it.</li>
<li> However, I would caution against using it all the time or in excessive amounts.</li>
<li> Too small for my looking.</li>
<li> DO NOT be fooled by the small bottle.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Unfortunately, I think U.S. consumers have become obsessed with quantity over quality.  This product is of the highest quality and does not require much quantity for proper usage.  My two year old daughter was experiencing difficulty with ingrown  toenails.  One visit to the doctor and she was prescribed antibiotics for infected toenails:(  After combining LESS THAN a PEA size amount of the Queen Bee Tamanu and topping it off with the Queen Bee Bee Nuts! Organic Cuticle Oil, my daughter&#x27;s toes have been prescription free for over the last year and a half!!  This product packs a powerful punch.  DO NOT be fooled by the small bottle.  The best things in life come in small packages:)</li>
    <li> This helped heal the skin after skin cancer. So pretty and clear!</li>
    <li> I love Queen Bee&#x27;s Tamanu Oil.  I have psoriasis and this helps to calm my skin down.  It reduces the redness and helps my skin to get back to normal.  I have been looking for a long time for a product that works.  I have tried alot of different creams that never seemed to do anything, but the Tamanu Oil really did the trick.  It also helps sunburns not last as long.</li>
    <li> After two pregnancies, I had quite a few dark spots on my face :( Tamanu is a dark spot ERASER! This is the first product I found that even seemed to make a difference. Well worth the dollars.</li>
    <li> I started using this oil as spot treatment on my acne after I went to Queen Bee this past summer and had a facial. She recommended this because I was trying to get rid of my light acne scarring and wanted a preventative to help keep me from getting more. It works wonders in healing without scars! However, I would caution against using it all the time or in excessive amounts. I started to notice that my skin got very fine little bumps in the places I was using the Tamanu oil, making my skin look and feel rough. It looked like it was getting in and staying in my pores. My skin is also pretty sensitive so that could be a factor, but it takes weeks for those little bumps to go away, so I&#x27;ve learned to us this sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, many people have been upset at the size of the bottle. It is true that it&#x27;s small, it&#x27;s more of a sample size, but a little goes a very long way! Especially in spot treatment. I usually shake the bottle, take off the cap and dip my finger in the left over oil on the cap, which is plenty for me.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware of the actual size of the container I had ordered - but I must say it is miniscule. What I received was a 1 1/2\\&quot; tall container about 1 cmm in diameter. I can&#x27;t even say it was 1/2 oz. - it was probably 1/8 of an ounce. Don&#x27;t get stuck on the $7ish price, its designed to draw your eye, this was a rip off. To top it off, I couldn&#x27;t even get it all out of the container because it crystallized in the bottom and is not pourable, so I don&#x27;t even know if its really 100% pure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered some organic tamanu - 2 fl oz for $24.00 - at the price I paid for the 1/8 oz I got - that same 2 oz bottle would have cost me over $100 and its not even organic. Don&#x27;t waste your money, buy your oil from:&lt;br /&gt;California Academy of Health (CAOH) - great stuff, way better quality.</li>
    <li> My son has typical teenage skin, and it looked sad. Seriously, this has helped dramatically. He also has &amp;#34;slapped cheeks,&amp;#34; and this is helping with that, as well. I am also enjoying healthier-looking skin. We will be buying (lots) more!</li>
    <li> To me, all these oils smell and feel like they are mixed with some cheap oil on the market..not worth the troubke to order them</li>
    <li> After hearing the superb reviews on Dr. Oz, I finally took the bait. I&#x27;d always been convinced about my need to try Tamanu oil but I&#x27;ve not been thoroughly convicted to purchase it until last month. First I will explain how I use it and then I will tell you about the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially used it during my evening ritual because it&#x27;s during the night that our skin heals and repairs itself. So I&#x27;d cleanse, tone, spot treat any visible and/or palpable blemishes (with Tea Tree essential oil) and wait a couple of minutes for the spot treatment to dry. Once dry,  I&#x27;d mix equal parts of organic jojoba oil and nighttime skin cream with 1drop of grapefruit EO (to aid in lightening the hyperpigmentation AND the smell is wonderful!) and 6-7 drops of Tamanu oil. After rubbing my palms together I&#x27;d gently glide this mixture all over my face (excluding the eye area), neck, the back of my neck to the top of my shoulders and of course my décolleté. The mixture was really absorbed into my skin and if I felt it still a bit oilier than I liked, I&#x27;d blot any oiliness with a soft tissue paper. My skin felt heavenly, happy, and satisfied. Then the magic happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d wake up, look in the mirror, and believe you me that after about 2 weeks my skin looked more supple, clean, youthful and was not oily at all!!! It was softer, smoother, and oh-so-touchable! So guess what!? I then began adding Tamanu to my morning routine after substituting lavender EO for the grapefruit EO (thus avoiding slight  photosensitivity!). What a difference in my skin. The deeper crows feet and smile lines now look visibly reduced and my skin is softer, more glowy (is this even a word?!) and my T-zone is almost unnoticeable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why the 3 stars? Bottle is only a dram in volume. Too small for my looking. So I&#x27;ve made a second purchase of a 2 oz. bottle of another brand and THAT one I&#x27;ve yet to review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> 100% Pure Tamanu Oil just arrived and I have not had time to use it yet. Am anxious to try it.</li>
    <li> As some other reviewers have noted, this product comes in a tiny bottle wrapped in bubble wrap and delivered in a manila envelope. The only bottles I&#x27;ve ever seen that are any smaller than this are perfume testers, and they are not smaller by very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I purchased this oil I read the product dimensions and saw 2.5 inches.  I assumed that was the bottle&#x27;s height, but it&#x27;s not.  When it arrived today I was shocked and thought, &amp;#34;No way.  That&#x27;s not 2.5 inches tall!&amp;#34;  I measured and the bottle is about 1 3/4 inches tall.  I re-read the product dimensions and found that it actually said this:  &amp;#34;2.5 x 0.2 x 0.2 inches&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is clearly not a description of the bottle.  It is a description, I suppose, of the amount of oil inside the bottle.  If you dumped it onto a counter, it would be 2.5 inches by a 20th of an inch by a 20th of an inch....  What kind of dimension is that???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here is the kicker; the next dimension shown is 2.1 ounces.  This is NOT fluid ounces!  This must be the weight or something, because when I put this bottle next to another bottle have containing .5 fluid ounces, the Queen Bee Tamanu oil bottle is TINY by comparison!  I don&#x27;t know what the actual fluid ounces are of the oil because the bottle does not say!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Queen Bee is very clearly using intentionally misleading figures here to misrepresent the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND THAT&#x27;S NOT ALL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I was buying an ORGANIC Tamanu oil.  Some of the other reviewers clearly thought the same thing.  Once again we are being mislead by clever word usage.  It&#x27;s NOT organic!  It&#x27;s &amp;#34;pure Tamanu oil&amp;#34; which is an &amp;#34;organic remedy&amp;#34;.  Big difference here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it said Organic Tamanu Oil, then it would be organically certified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But since it says, &amp;#34;Pure Tamanu Oil, an organic remedy....&amp;#34; then it is NOT organic.  They are using the word organic in a different context here, to mean that it is derived from a plant. NOT that it is organically grown and processed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are once again using fancy wordplay to misrepresent the product.  TOTALLY UNCOOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly I will discuss price.  Usually when I buy supplements and healthcare products from Amazon, the price is roughly half of what I would pay in my local health food store.  Well I looked at Simplers Organics Pure Tamanu oil in my local health food store before making this purchase, and the bottle they had was AT LEAST twice this size, if not more, and it was selling for about $22.  So the price on this Queen Bee product is no bargain at all.  I basically paid the same price as I would at my health food store, where they have a huge overhead and I get to try the oil before I buy.  BAD DEAL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle may contain pure Tamanu oil (although my trust in this company is hanging by a spider&#x27;s thread at this point so I wouldn&#x27;t bet on it) and that oil may be of good quality.  I don&#x27;t know.  I can&#x27;t tell.  I&#x27;m not a testing laboratory.  But what I CAN tell is this company is using misrepresentation to sell their product, and that&#x27;s not cool.  This doesn&#x27;t appear to be a company with integrity AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably keep this bottle only because it&#x27;s too much trouble to return it, but I will be contacting Amazon about this, and as someone who sells on Amazon as well I know they will want to know about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I will never purchase anything from this company again.  There are too many other companies out there with honest descriptions and good quality products.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use daily, but use on cuts, bites and burns. I put on at night and in morning, all better!  I do put on a surgical scar that is 2 years old, and seems to be helping with that too</li>
    <li> I am a Chef and get burns every now in then from grease or just open flames. I have use Tamanu oil and mixed it with a a little Aloe and it heals the burns very fast and without any scars. I wish Queen bee would sell it in a larger Bottle. I think it is very well priced for what it does for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy, Cant  wait for a bigger Bottle.</li>
    <li> wish i had read the other reviews 1st. the quality of the oil is good but far too small of a quantity for the price. will buy from a different vendor in the future.</li>
    <li> This oil is great and the vender is excellent. My product was damaged in the mail and the vender wasted no time in not only refunding my money, but also supplied me with a free bottle because of the trouble I had.  I&#x27;ve never had any company go to such an extend to make a customer happy. Don&#x27;t hestitate to buy this!</li>
    <li> I was so shocked to receive a big envelope from U.P.S. and it felt like he was handing me an envelope with a letter in it.  so light. I said I hope there is a bottle of oil in there.  He said no bottle today!&lt;br /&gt;It was in there so small. a gram.  How are you going to use enough of it to see if it works.  Too expensive  for such a small amount. I&#x27;ll try my healthfood store or somewhere else in the future. Sorry I don&#x27;t like to be negative but this wasn&#x27;t a plus.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t help with my current condition, but was worth a shot. It may work for someone else. There are a lot of organic ingredients/products out there that claim to fix certain problems. I can&#x27;t tell others not to buy it, I can only tell you that it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I am so sad, seriously, I seriously was ripped off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you notice that NO WHERE does it state how many oz of actual oil you get? Yeah, now I notice that too..... after the fact of course.&lt;br /&gt;It gives you &amp;#34;product dimensions&amp;#34; and shows you this bottle next to a sheet of paper - so you assume that you&#x27;re getting an excellent value and the bottle will be of a decent size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WRONG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was - rather AM so sad, EMBARASSED that Id been taken &amp; felt stupid for not doing more research first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle is literally (as I have one to compare to) the size of a perfume test / sample bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Ludicrous. At this rate it would cost you about $100/oz for this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SAVE YOUR MONEY and get a better value and quality product ELSEWHERE. ANYWHERE! I don’t care just DON’T waste your money on this one time use small tiny miniscule vial</li>
    <li> I wondered why it was $8.92 for 1/8 of an ounce. I thought, \\&quot;Perhaps the other Tamanu Oils sold for $13 per ounce are not 100%.\\&quot; However, the other Tamanu oils on amazon ARE 100% Tamanu Oil. So, this brand is too expensive for me. The oil itself is wonderful. I am using it for an extensive surgical scar. It&#x27;s very thick and it stays on the skin for a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few weeks ago and it is amazing. Put it on my eczema and could feel it working right away. I&#x27;m gonna try my brown spots now that i read another review about using it on that too. Buy and you will love, totally worth the price. A little goes a long way!!</li>
    <li> Bought to treat adult acne but had no effect on it.</li>
    <li> This product  is  excellent for moisturizing my skin especially when exposed to alot of sun. Only a very little is required and best used at night.  I  was very disappointed in the size and amount.. I was expecting a much larger amount for the price.  I will not purchase again from this company. The poor star rating was not because the product is inferior, but I felt ripped off! Do your homework carefully!  I guess I didn&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> very very small small!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this tamanu oil a few times because I always like to keep it around the house for when we have skin issues. It&#x27;s great for healing and excessive dryness. We use it on our hands after a weekend of skiing when they get really chapped and in the summer for sunburn. I love that it&#x27;s organic - so much better than chemical-filled products.</li>
    <li> You do not need much of a large amount for a high quality item and is certainly that.  Had surgery and it helped reduce the scaring and encourage healing.</li>
