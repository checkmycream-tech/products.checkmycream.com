      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>I use a 500 watt UV light on it and the effect is awesome.</li>
      <li>It worked well and everyone loved it.</li>
      <li>I used it for my costume for talent show and it made it a very memorable show.</li>
      <li>I have use this product for years now and i love it.</li>
      <li>I use it on most everything; plants, trees and people.</li>
      <li>You will need may uv ligths to be able to see the hair spray working.</li>
      <li>The tours love it.</li>
      <li>This brightness is excellent hair shining in the dark blue they recommend, is very economical and looks great for partying at night with neon lights, I recommend to all rumberos!</li>
      <li>but it looked great under the black lights and washed out of my daughters hair very easily!  </li>
      <li>and it works just fine.</li>
      <li>This was a HUGE hit at my daughters glow party by both the boys and the girls.</li>
      <li>It is easy to clean.</li>
      <li>But it is noticabl when light are on.  </li>
      <li>Other than that, I loved it!</li>
      <li>It does need to be sprayed on outside because it doesn&#x27;t have a pleasant smell</li>
      <li>This is a great product and I would strongly recommend buying it even if you are slightly considering.</li>
      <li>Cool hair spray.  </li>
      <li>Arrived really quickly.</li>
      <li>It ended up taking a pretty long spraying session to get it to show to any degree, and even then the glow wasn&#x27;t too bright.</li>
      <li>it could be fun for kids with Halloween.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
      <li>it was well worth</li>
      <li>Fun idea, but this product needs work</li>
      <li>Everybody came up to me saying how amazing me and my friends looked in the black light.</li>
      <li>While it doesn&#x27;t glow purple, like the picture on amazon implies, it does light up in blacklight (light yellow color).  </li>
      <li>This hairspray works exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>Really neat to be able to have hairspray that glow in black light.</li>
      <li>I first sprayed it in my shirt under a black light and it worked great with just a little bit</li>
      <li>It definitely doesn&#x27;t glow the way the picture shows or not even strong.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, too.</li>
      <li>Very upsetting.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>This product really made our glow in the dark/ black light themed party so much fun.</li>
      <li>I bought this, thinking it would only take a few quick sprays to show up with how many blacklights there were around</li>
      <li>Good, not great.</li>
      <li>Easy transaction, mailing more expensive than the product.</li>
      <li>(every light socket in the room was full of them, with a few extra).</li>
      <li>It was blue and was not noticeable in regular light.</li>
      <li>spray flakes and is different colors without any description on these listing of exactly which color</li>
      <li>My Daughter is having a ball using it and playing under her black light.</li>
      <li>This did not work AT ALL, even in direct black light.</li>
      <li>The only thing I really didn&#x27;t care for was the fact that it is powdery.</li>
      <li>We sprayed a little on my hand and held it under a black light and its glow was very noticeable.</li>
      <li>You have to soak your hair with this and even then it barely glows</li>
      <li>, don&#x27;t get me wrong, it just wasn&#x27;t the highest quality, and with how much you put in to make it work you can definitely see it in regular light.</li>

    <li> Purchased for my daughter&#x27;s glow party.  Made everyone&#x27;s hair look gray under the blacklight.  I would suggest using in a well ventilated area otherwise be prepared to choke on the fumes.</li>
    <li> What can I say but that this stuff is what it says it is and will be reflective.  Good product.</li>
    <li> This hairspray works exactly as advertised. We sprayed a little on my hand and held it under a black light and its glow was very noticeable. Would buy this again. Fast shipping, too.</li>
    <li> You have to soak your hair with this and even then it barely glows I had to point it out to people and then they were like o yeah I can kinda see it glowing.</li>
    <li> Cool hair spray.  Your hair does glow when you use it.  Can spray on anything you want.  But it is noticabl when light are on.  It is easy to clean. just like regular hair spray your hair just turns grey.</li>
    <li> I was looking for rave material so this did not meet my expectations it could be fun for kids with Halloween.&lt;br /&gt;If looking for rave stuff get glow in the dark spray paint I had to get it at michaels.</li>

    <li> I bought this to add a bit of UV glow to my sons Halloween props hair( read wig material).  Overall they spray works however the effect is very subtle.</li>
    <li> This spray makes it look like you have Dandruff flakes.&lt;br /&gt;This spray flakes and is different colors without any description on these listing of exactly which color you are purchasing.it&#x27;s a guessing game. Did glow and did make a big mess on me my body and anything it rubbed off on. Plus Extremely pUNGENT lingering extreme chemical smell!!!&lt;br /&gt;Will never use this product again!&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully someone less sensitive to extreme chemicals will take it from me at this point...</li>
