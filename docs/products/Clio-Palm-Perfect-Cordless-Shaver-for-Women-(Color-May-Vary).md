      <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>

      <li>I also love this!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love this!</li>
      <li>So glad I have something that&#x27;s not gonna cut up my legs!</li>
      <li>Honestly, this doesn&#x27;t even deserve a star.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it was an ideal situation:  </li>
      <li>Other than that, great price, great product!</li>
      <li>It also worked okay on my legs, but I&#x27;ll probably stick with shaving with a razor for that since I have very light hair</li>
      <li>Its light, can be used in the shower, and painless!</li>
      <li>and she (and we) love it.  </li>
      <li>But I do love my Clio for my underarms and it does well in  bikini area if I don&#x27;t have time to shave with a disposable razor.</li>
      <li>It just cuts it off at the top.  </li>
      <li>I love</li>
      <li>It works great and gives a very close shave without any irritation.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Having never owned an electric shaver, I wasn&#x27;t sure how a cheap, but</li>
      <li>But I was able to get my legs to feel really smooth.   </li>
      <li>cute, little thing like the Palm Perfect would work.</li>
      <li>the head doesn&#x27;t come off for easy cleaning.</li>
      <li>Not the smooth sleek feeling that you can easily obtain from a set of $3 desposible razors.</li>
      <li>what a wonderful little shaver.    </li>
      <li>Well, it worked great, took a bit longer than shaving but got the same results and no irritated skin!</li>
      <li>Fantastic product</li>
      <li>I did not submerge it under water, I used it lightly in the shower and it stopped working.</li>
      <li>The quality is good but, if you are thinking in buying this product, please make sure that you have enough AAA batteries at home.</li>
      <li>Quick and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Originally, P.O. when shopping in the drugstore I seen this for $10.</li>
      <li>Originally I bought this shaver while on vacation.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really  get too close as a shaving razor would or as smooth, but I love it just as.</li>
      <li>I wish it had come with a brush to clean the inside of blades, etc.</li>
      <li>Just right for beginners!</li>
      <li>I only wish that I didn&#x27;t get a defective shaver in the first place, otherwise I would have been happy with my purchase...</li>
      <li>so if it is only good for that</li>
      <li>The batteries are eaten up quickly even with it off, so remove the batteries when you aren&#x27;t using it.</li>
      <li>a quick swipe</li>
      <li>A very effective little shaver for the price (and you don&#x27;t have to worry about breaking it, since it&#x27;s so cheap).  </li>
      <li>It was pretty cheap but looked like it would ge</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth it</li>
      <li>Fresh batteries and</li>
      <li>Got the package when it came in the mail, it came pretty quickly but that&#x27;s all I can say about the pros of this product.</li>
      <li>I have used this myself and cuts right thru the hair.</li>
      <li>If a quick \\&quot;maintenance\\&quot; shave is all you need, I would highly recommend picking up this affordable time-saver and mess-avoider!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft, easy to hold and has a rope on the bottom</li>
      <li>At first, I was very happy with the product, it gave a close shave and it was small enough.</li>
      <li>The first one I bought seemed to have a faulty motor.</li>
      <li>I am invited out at the last minute, my shirt top is sleeveless, and I have the women&#x27;s version of a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow in my armpits and on my legs.</li>
      <li>I even checked multiple times to make sure I followed the directions, and to no avail it still didn&#x27;t turn on.    </li>
      <li>I however prefer to use a disposable for these areas as they are smaller and get in them better.</li>
      <li>I am currently looking for something better for the summer time.</li>
      <li>I contacted the company and was sent a new one right away at no charge.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to try an electric razor (my husband loves his).</li>
      <li>my daughter wasn&#x27;t quite ready to shave with a razor blade</li>
      <li>It really is.  </li>
      <li>, it did not make my skin bleed, I got no razor burn at all, and, it gave me a smooth shave!Three days later, no razor bumps or redness either!</li>
      <li>but this product is very convenient to do so.</li>
      <li>I bought this at Walgreens because I was planning on going swimming this weekend and wanted to be ready.</li>
      <li>Again, seemingly the same result as using a manual razor;  smooth and irritation-free.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I replace them once in a while, but with the last one I bought, I am very dissapointed because the batteries doesn&#x27;t last more than 1 week.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a cute, convenient little razor, and it&#x27;s reasonably priced, too.</li>
      <li>Most importantly it&#x27;s safe, I don&#x27;t have to worry about my daughter cutting her legs up with a real razor;)</li>
      <li>It is a wet/dry model, the battery usage was fairly minimal, and the rubberized grip made it easy to grip in the shower.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
      <li>I love this little razor.</li>
      <li>And honestly, that&#x27;s just not worth spending another thirty bucks on a different product.</li>
      <li>About a month after using it rarely, it wouldn&#x27;t shave close enough or at all, I tried cleaning it out but that did nothing.</li>
      <li>Second, only buy this if your all of 12 and have baby fine hair to remove, anyone who has shaved longer than 10 minutes and is dealing with course leg hair (like the majority of adults) need not apply.</li>
      <li>I trashed it and bought a new shaver from the store.</li>
      <li>I barely had any hair to trim and even with that being said it ripped, tore, aggravated and caused me much discomfort.</li>
      <li>The only downside to it is that it&#x27;s pretty loud.</li>
      <li>tried it right away, I dry shaved my legs,</li>
      <li>The angle on the shaver could be a little better, but that&#x27;s my only gripe.  </li>
      <li>DO NOT  WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
      <li>I had purchased this item for only 8.99, so I wasn&#x27;t really expecting it to work all that well.</li>
      <li>I tried shaving in every direction for 20 minutes straight on different parts of my body, and no matter what I did there was still hair.</li>
      <li>Complete garbage.</li>
      <li>Got this for my 16 year old daughter</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been curious about electric razors so I bought this.  What a waste of money.  It doesn&#x27;t even feel like I shaved.  My husband said I was \\&quot;porcupine prickly\\&quot; after I used it.  Very disappointed in the product.  I guess you do get what you pay for so don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter who is 13 and is afraid to use a razor blade.  It works great and gives a very close shave without any irritation.  I have a Lady Remington, which won&#x27;t even take the hair off my legs and gave me razor burn so badly that it hurt for days!  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this little razor!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who hate shaving.  Probably b/c I always break out when my hair grows back and it&#x27;s quite painful.  Therefore, I hardly ever shave.  My husband doesn&#x27;t appreciate that.  Anyway, I digress.  I saw this at the pharmacy as I was shopping for other things.  I decided I&#x27;d give it a try b/c it says it&#x27;s Painless.  It really is.  This is just like using a razor.  It does not pull the hair from the root.  It just cuts it off at the top.  But I was able to get my legs to feel really smooth.   My leg hair was fairly long and I had no problems with the Clio.  I&#x27;m really happy with it.  I haven&#x27;t tried my bikini yet.  The only downside to it is that it&#x27;s pretty loud.</li>
    <li> I picked up this product at a local drug store figuring I would give it a try. I was very disappointed in the results. I tried shaving both dry and wet, and both left my legs with a stubbly feeling. I would not recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I always hated shaving my bikini line since I have very sensitive skin and always get red bumps, irritated skin, etc. So I picked up this little thing to try it out before my last resort which was waxing (ouch!). Well, it worked great, took a bit longer than shaving but got the same results and no irritated skin! Will have to touch up every couple of days since you&#x27;re basically just shaving off the exposed hair, but it still beats having to shave with a razor. It also worked okay on my legs, but I&#x27;ll probably stick with shaving with a razor for that since I have very light hair and I def. Missed some spots since I wasn&#x27;t using shaving cream. Def. Recommending this to all my girlfriends..love it!!</li>
    <li> I use Clio shavers for about 4 years. I replace them once in a while, but with the last one I bought, I am very dissapointed because the batteries doesn&#x27;t last more than 1 week. Hopefully, Clio will review this product and will do something about it. The quality is good but, if you are thinking in buying this product, please make sure that you have enough AAA batteries at home.</li>
    <li> I love this little razor. Its light, can be used in the shower, and painless! The only issue I have had is that I am on a never ending search for the razor replacements. I thought I would find them here on Amazon, but have only found them online through CVS..which does not supply them in store. Other than that, great price, great product!</li>
    <li> I love this! It comes with a clear little plastic top for when not in use, and a little rope to hang it on something. It doesn&#x27;t really  get too close as a shaving razor would or as smooth, but I love it just as.</li>
    <li> Bought this for preteen grandaughter and she loves it. She said it worked perfect.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Originally, P.O. when shopping in the drugstore I seen this for $10. I was in a hurry, needed to shave and leave for my trip...  &lt;br /&gt;I learned: &lt;br /&gt;IF you are tired of shaving and finding later that you missed some hairs, or, you are dry shaving in a hurry and getting more razor burn than shaved hairs...or you buy cheapie razors and find they do not cut hairs.. this is the best thing around.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I tried it right away, I dry shaved my legs, OMG it did not cut my scar, it did not make my skin bleed, I got no razor burn at all, and, it gave me a smooth shave!Three days later, no razor bumps or redness either! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;CLIO battery operated shavers (only 2 AA), I found mine at rite-aid pahrmacy!</li>
    <li> Originally I bought this shaver while on vacation. It was pretty cheap but looked like it would ge tthe job done. I was impressed. It is a wet/dry model, the battery usage was fairly minimal, and the rubberized grip made it easy to grip in the shower. The closeness of the shave was phenomenal, and that impressed me the most. It&#x27;s the only shaver I&#x27;ve ever used on my bikini line that DID NOT leave razor bumps. I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> Got the package when it came in the mail, it came pretty quickly but that&#x27;s all I can say about the pros of this product. I ordered the Clio shaver thinking that it would be a great alternative to manual razor shaving, and it WOULD HAVE been, but instead as I inserted the batteries and pressed the ON button, it did not work to my dismay. I even checked multiple times to make sure I followed the directions, and to no avail it still didn&#x27;t turn on.    The only thing that happened was that the batteries began to overheat from being left inside the shaver for some strange reason.     I only wish that I didn&#x27;t get a defective shaver in the first place, otherwise I would have been happy with my purchase...</li>
    <li> I paid $10 thinking this would be a good way to save on buying replacement blades for the schick razor I have - Wrong. I used it on my underarms and it barely removed any hair. I&#x27;m not very hairy so I don&#x27;t know why it couldn&#x27;t do the job. I don&#x27;t have to shave my legs so if it is only good for that then it&#x27;s no good to me.</li>
    <li> The size and weight of this shaver is perfect. It does hurt a little bit when using it but the pain doesn&#x27;t last long. I wish it had come with a brush to clean the inside of blades, etc.</li>
    <li> At first, I was very happy with the product, it gave a close shave and it was small enough. About a month after using it rarely, it wouldn&#x27;t shave close enough or at all, I tried cleaning it out but that did nothing. Then one day it just, stopped. I trashed it and bought a new shaver from the store. Don&#x27;t waste your time or your money on this product.</li>
    <li> This only lasted me a month. It says it&#x27;s water resistant and it still got oxidized. I did not submerge it under water, I used it lightly in the shower and it stopped working. If you&#x27;re looking for a water resistant razor, save yourself some money and buy your razor from another company.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Clio for over 2 years. The first one I bought seemed to have a faulty motor. I contacted the company and was sent a new one right away at no charge. I have never tried this wet as I have seen reviews on here advising against it.  I have found it is not a good leg shaver, as my legs always feel stubbly even after a few paces. It just simply does not cut as close as a disposable razor. It does however work great for my under arms- a quick swipe and I&#x27;m good to go. I still shave the same amount-every other day(I don&#x27;t like stubble)- but this product is very convenient to do so. It also works well for the bikini area...though I usually go over the area with a disposable as well. I have used this in the \\&quot;nooks and crannies\\&quot; a few times and it does well, does not cut me though sometimes it pulls. I however prefer to use a disposable for these areas as they are smaller and get in them better. But I do love my Clio for my underarms and it does well in  bikini area if I don&#x27;t have time to shave with a disposable razor.</li>
    <li> I purchashed this shaver for my preteen daughter and she loves it. I like the fact that the shaver is a reasonable price, small, has a cord to hang it with, and cute (she likes the pink.) Most importantly it&#x27;s safe, I don&#x27;t have to worry about my daughter cutting her legs up with a real razor;)</li>
    <li> I loved this product. For the price it works great. I used it as soon as I received it and I was amaze at how well it worked for the price. It worked well on legs and underarms. It don&#x27;t burn or pull hairs. It is truly painless. I got one for my daughter and she loved it as well. I think this is a great product for the money.</li>
    <li> A very effective little shaver for the price (and you don&#x27;t have to worry about breaking it, since it&#x27;s so cheap).  The angle on the shaver could be a little better, but that&#x27;s my only gripe.  And honestly, that&#x27;s just not worth spending another thirty bucks on a different product.</li>
    <li> My daughter just started shaving and this is perfect for her!  Quick and easy to use. I don&#x27;t have to worry about her cutting herself.  I have used this myself and cuts right thru the hair. Great for teenagers and traveling.</li>
    <li> I own this shaver and I am not too impressed with it.  I bought it at the drug store and although it cuts the hair, it still makes my legs feel like I have stubble and havent shaved in a day or so.  I miss having a close shave, this does not deliever it.  I am currently looking for something better for the summer time.</li>
    <li> The razor is lightweight, fits in the palm of your hand and can be used wet or dry.  It&#x27;s soft, easy to hold and has a rope on the bottom so you can hang it in your shower.  It&#x27;s a cute, convenient little razor, and it&#x27;s reasonably priced, too.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this item for only 8.99, so I wasn&#x27;t really expecting it to work all that well. It cuts but still leaves my legs feeling stubbly.</li>
    <li> I got this at walgreens for $10. It was great. I do not shave regularly, and it got all of the hair in about 1-2 passes. This razor is simple, it runs on batteries, not the rechargable ones. If the batteries go dead, just put new ones in, no waiting for a recharge. I stopped using it because the spring that holds the battery cover on broke. It will still work if you push on it really hard, but it is on the bottom of the razor, so you cannot do this and use it.   My husband used it once on a trip when he for got his razor. He said that it did as well as his electric. The only problem he had was that the trimmers on the side kept cutting his sideburns.</li>
    <li> I tried switching the batteries around and it still didn&#x27;t work. I was very disappointed and feel like I wasted my money!</li>
    <li> This cordless shaving device is just perfect! Great for all areas of the body and a good hairline trim it&#x27;s worth it</li>
    <li> I got this to save myself the trouble of having to wet shave. After about 5 or so minutes of trying the shaver in every direction, the hair was still there. That&#x27;s as far as I got - the battery died. Fresh batteries and it drained them. Yep. I hope they didn&#x27;t invest a crap ton in these because it&#x27;s a terrible waste. I returned mine for a refund.</li>
    <li> So glad I have something that&#x27;s not gonna cut up my legs! Fantastic product</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to use as an alternative to \\&quot;manual razor + shave gel + sink &#x3D; mess.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having never owned an electric shaver, I wasn&#x27;t sure how a cheap, but cute, little thing like the Palm Perfect would work. The first time I used it was an ideal situation:  I am invited out at the last minute, my shirt top is sleeveless, and I have the women&#x27;s version of a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow in my armpits and on my legs. After that first use, I got the same result as with the manual razor in mere seconds and minus the mess. I was so impressed with the ease of shaving my underarms that I went ahead and shaved my legs. Again, seemingly the same result as using a manual razor;  smooth and irritation-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning I noticed those areas shaved the night before to seem as if the hair had grown A LOT overnight. This is probably due to the electric shaver being unable to cut off as much hair since you can&#x27;t press down nearly as hard as would using a manual razor. Overall, I think the Palm Perfect does a wonderful job. If a quick \\&quot;maintenance\\&quot; shave is all you need, I would highly recommend picking up this affordable time-saver and mess-avoider! (Note: My hair is dark and course, and it may respond differently to electric shavers than those with lighter-colored or thinner body hair.)</li>
    <li> This was one of the worst shavers I&#x27;ve EVER had the displeasure of wasting my money on. I barely had any hair to trim and even with that being said it ripped, tore, aggravated and caused me much discomfort. I had to keep the misery going by redoing the same patches of hair, irritating my skin and taking way to long for what should have been an easy &amp;#34;tidy up&amp;#34; job. Waste of money, time and worst of all the aggravation of my skin. Complete garbage.</li>
    <li> Honestly, this doesn&#x27;t even deserve a star. It is the absolutely worst investment I have ever made. I understand it is an inexpensive shaver, so I didn&#x27;t expect much, but expected SOMETHING! I tried shaving in every direction for 20 minutes straight on different parts of my body, and no matter what I did there was still hair. I read the directions and tried again, and still my hair was attached to the pores of my body. Terrible! DO NOT  WASTE YOUR MONEY. I will be getting my money back. This product is CRAPTASTIC!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to try an electric razor (my husband loves his). So I picked this one up at CVS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did it remove absolutely no hair, but it was incredibly painful; the minute I tried shaving with it, it felt like I was pricking the skin. I thought maybe I was using it in the wrong direction, so I tried another...which hurt just as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy it. It&#x27;s not worth the pain or money.</li>
    <li> I have had the last shaver like this for the past 2 years and the blade finally got dull. Just ordered another because there is no other shaver like it.  Does not tug or pull and does not irritate in the least.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this at Walgreens because I was planning on going swimming this weekend and wanted to be ready. This is the WORSE shaver I have ever used. First, only buy this razor if you can actually schedule at least a one hour shaving session because it takes FOREVER. Second, only buy this if your all of 12 and have baby fine hair to remove, anyone who has shaved longer than 10 minutes and is dealing with course leg hair (like the majority of adults) need not apply. Third, it took so long to SHAVE that the AAA batteries I used whipped out! I had to replace the batteries before I was done - NO JOKE! Lastly, even though I spent a sold hour shaving, and turning the razor in every crazy angle and used every kind of pressure -- my legs and arms feel like that day after stubble. Not the smooth sleek feeling that you can easily obtain from a set of $3 desposible razors. I&#x27;m so uncomfortable, stubbly, and itchy I&#x27;m going to have to go back to the drug store and buy a set of bic&#x27;s before I jump into the lake tomorrow. Don&#x27;t buy this product!</li>
    <li> Works and Looks Great!</li>
    <li> Got this for my 16 year old daughter She LOVES the fact that you can use it in the shower or as a dry shaver! I also love this!</li>
    <li> This product does not work at all but I could only find that out after I used it.</li>
    <li> i have nothing but great things to say about this product.  my daughter wasn&#x27;t quite ready to shave with a razor blade so we started her with this and she (and we) love it.  what a wonderful little shaver.    i had bought a different shaver from this company for me and was pleasantly surprised (at the price!)...so we decided we&#x27;d try this for our daughter.  it&#x27;s not often that we both like the same stuff...so i didn&#x27;t tell her i bought the men&#x27;s version from the same company...because my daughter thinks her shaver is \\&quot;cool\\&quot;.    thank you.</li>
    <li> Just right for beginners!</li>
    <li> This shaver gets the job done but you do have to go over the area several times for it to shave the hair completely. It&#x27;s very similar to a Remington cordless shaver except the head doesn&#x27;t come off for easy cleaning. It is hard to clean completely. I love it&#x27;s detachable string because leaving it on I would get it caught in blades. The batteries are eaten up quickly even with it off, so remove the batteries when you aren&#x27;t using it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. I really have to work to get the hair off by bushing hard and going over the same spot constantly. This might be helpful if you have like 3 hours to shave but who has that time.</li>
