    <li> This is the best moisture body wash I have found. The only problem is you can buy it in the store. When searching for a store to purchase it Walmart &amp; Walgrens were listed. I have check 4-5 Walmarts &amp; 2-3 Walgrens. They all say Gold Bond makes lotion not body wash. I don&#x27;t mind shopping on the internet, but it is handy to pick up when shopping.</li>
    <li> Excellent,!!!! try it and you&#x27;ll love it. I&#x27;ve used all of the body washes and found them all rewarding.  Your skin fells soft and refreshed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a friend who is bed ridden and she likes to take showers with Gold Bond all the time</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 years. Nothing compares. It leaves your skin soft. AZ weather dry&#x27;s everything out but the Gold Bond Products are the best.</li>

    <li> Gold Bond Body Wash is a very good product it softens the skin while providing moisture. It is hard to find a product that compares to&lt;br /&gt;this product, I can&#x27;t find it in stores so I have to order it from amazon.</li>
    <li> When I ran out of the last tube of Gold Bond Ultimate Deep Moisture softening  Body Wash I could not find a store that  carried them anymore.  I went to Amazon as a last resort to find them and and was so happy to see I could buy them here.  I have extremely dry itchy skin especially my back and this is the only thing that would help with the dryness.  Thank you Amazon for helping me find this.</li>

    <li> I started using Gold Bond body wash with Shea Butter a couple months ago. I&#x27;d had bad luck with every body wash I tried. Everything left my skin dry after washing. Since using the Gold Bond body wash, I haven&#x27;t had that problem. I love this product!</li>
    <li> Best body wash...Period!!! Using this for 3 years and it keeps skin from drying. Softening &amp; Exfoliating are the best.</li>
    <li> We have used Gold Bod products for many years and decided to try their body wash. Husband has very dry skin that is irritated by the fragrances in many body washes. Gold Bond softens and calms his skin, and has a refreshing scent that has not caused irritation while providing odor control. Great product!</li>
    <li> I was having all sorts of issues with dry skin and rashes, and then I tried this. It&#x27;s a lovely product that creates a creamy foam. It helped to solve the problem. I bought three more so I need never have to go through the winter without it.</li>
