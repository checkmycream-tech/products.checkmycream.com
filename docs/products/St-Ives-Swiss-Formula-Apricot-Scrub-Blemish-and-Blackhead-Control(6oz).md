      <li>Great facial scrub, does the trick to get your face washed &amp; feels great with my skin routine.</li>

      <li>And much much more.</li>

      <li>Are you using it more?</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a exfoliating face wash.</li>
      <li>it takes more time though like 2-3 weeks to see results.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t found a better face scrub yet.</li>
      <li>I decided to try this since I had so many family and friends recommended it and reading its review.</li>
      <li>This is currently my favorite face-care product.</li>
      <li>Just try, try again; you&#x27;ll find something that works for you! :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff forever and love it.</li>
      <li>However it doesn&#x27;t magically remove pimples like I though it would before.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gotten rid of most of my blackheads, prevented more from developing, and prevents pimples.</li>
      <li>I love it and literally haven&#x27;t had a breakout since using.</li>
      <li>worked better.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
      <li>It works quite well, and it&#x27;s been a favorite face wash of mine for well over 10 years now.</li>
      <li>This scrub will leave your face nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>love this product</li>
      <li>i love the smell its not to strong.</li>
      <li>I picked this up on a whim after reading this review on amazon, mostly because it was cheap</li>
      <li>Ives Apricot Scrub is a great face wash for removing makeup, and for exfoliating old skin from your face.</li>
      <li>Much more exfoliation power than in the original Apricot Scrub version.</li>
      <li>Loyal customer for life!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had a huge skin problem either</li>
      <li>Works great as a daily ex-foliate.  </li>
      <li>I use it every morning - keeps my skin clear and bright, without irritation.</li>
      <li>buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s more economical to buy the largest tube though.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe that a product so cheap can work so well, but this is a miracle worker.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fairly big tube, I say and this was a really great buy.</li>
      <li>I find that it&#x27;s the best product to use before using any foundation regime as well as it will remove all of the dead skin on your face leaving you with a clean</li>
      <li>After the hour and a half phone call, I went in to rinse my face off and found that it was SUPER clean, super smooth, and FLAWLESS.</li>
      <li>My face doesn&#x27;t feel clean without it.</li>
      <li>It cleans out pours and leaves skin super smooth, without drying it out.</li>
      <li>Makes my face feel really clean</li>
      <li>It exfoliates and cleanses well, and makes my face feel clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>It has a nice, fresh scent (not too powerful though), it is a fairly strong exfoliator, and also has some acne-fighting active ingredients to help keep your face free of blemishes.</li>
      <li>It does not take away current acne you have, but it does an amazing job preventing it.</li>
      <li>It takes off that top layer of old skin cells.  </li>
      <li>I swear by this stuff to give my face a fresh look.</li>
      <li>You just rub a bit over the area, wash it and it scabs the thing right over and starts healing.  </li>
      <li>The apricot seed bits has just the right texture.  </li>
      <li>You get what you pay for, right?  </li>
      <li>Plus, it should more readily absorb whatever you&#x27;re putting on it and be super soft afterwards.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for using prior to skin masks as well.&lt;br /&gt;Although technically this product is supposed to control blackheads</li>
      <li>this one is rough on the skin and leaves my skin SUPER CLEAN AND SMOOTH like a baby&#x27;s skin.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Is the same product as St. Ives Blemish &amp; Blackhead Control Apricot Scrub, but it costs three time more.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use it consistently, just whenever I get a zit</li>
      <li>This one works really well!</li>
      <li>the beads inside the product really feels like it removing the dirt, Will be buying this again!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>This is definitely the most effective way to clear back acne.  </li>
      <li>re readily absorb whatever you&#x27;re putting on it and be super soft afterwards.</li>
      <li>You either used it too much, and too often, or you are allergic to apricot, walnuts, or corn.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very picky.</li>
      <li>Thanks St. Ives</li>
      <li>It is gentle and I use it about twice a week.</li>
      <li>This product exfoliates really well.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say this product works in that sense, but it exfoliates the skin very nicely.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff forever and love it. It&#x27;s got tiny little microbeads that seem to really scour the skin without hurting.</li>
    <li> 3 stars because it&#x27;s not great but not horrible. I used this in hopes of getting rid of ingrown hairs and bumps around bikini area. I noticed a fair improvement but nothing drastic.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t found a better face scrub yet. This one works really well!</li>
    <li> This is a lifesaver. I was a frequent buyer of Proactiv+ which is very expensive. I decided to try this since I had so many family and friends recommended it and reading its review. My skin looks amazing! I love it and literally haven&#x27;t had a breakout since using. I pair it with their green tea facial wash. Highly recommend for any skin type.</li>
    <li> Works great will purchase the rest of my life</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. I get complimented on my skin all the time. I have tried many expensive exfoliants, including the Mia. I like my Mia, but nothing beats the convenience of this scrub in the shower. I recommend this one with the salicylic acid over the plain one. My derm recommended I use products with this in it. I don&#x27;t have a problem with breaking out to begin with, but this added ingredient just boosts it up a notch.  Don&#x27;t scrub too hard. Just a nice polish in small circles and then rinse off. I can totally tell the difference if I skip using this for a few days. I start to get blackheads around my nose and chin and my skin just doesn&#x27;t glow as much as usual. I highly recommend this scrub.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 31 years old and have been using St. Ives apricot scrub ever since I can remember. It&#x27;s a trick my other passed on to me.&lt;br /&gt;I have a pretty solid skin routine and I&#x27;m very picky. I have tried other more expensive brands only to find out it&#x27;s not worth the splurge. I scrub it on my damp face 2-3 times a week and it makes my skin very smooth and even. It&#x27;s great for using prior to skin masks as well.&lt;br /&gt;Although technically this product is supposed to control blackheads it will definitely not scrub them away. The blackheads that are already there need to be extracted individually (at a spa or at home and it hurts!!). What the product will do for blackheads is help prevent new ones by getting rid of dead skin cells and dirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say I have never had severe acne problems so I&#x27;m not sure if this would help smooth out acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something to get rid of dull skin and bring out the glow this is a good inexpensive way to do it.</li>
    <li> I agree completely with the review above.  I&#x27;ve never had a huge skin problem either, I get the occasional zit but they are enormous and last for ages.  I&#x27;ve tried so many products, expensive ones that you would think would kick them. You get what you pay for, right?  Neutrogena gets rave reviews but does nothing for me. I picked this up on a whim after reading this review on amazon, mostly because it was cheap (I paid about $3) and I was tired of wasting $10 on a tube of cream that I would use for a week and then throw in the basement in disgust.  I can&#x27;t believe that a product so cheap can work so well, but this is a miracle worker.  I don&#x27;t use it consistently, just whenever I get a zit and it works IMMEDIATELY. You just rub a bit over the area, wash it and it scabs the thing right over and starts healing.  They are usually under control within a day. Besides using it as a spot treatment, it makes your skin incredibly smooth and TIGHT. If I use this, I swear my skin looks younger, I don&#x27;t know how or why but my skin is firmer and the skin around my eyes looks amazing even though I have horrible dark circles and droopy eyes. I use it like once a week just for this effect. I would reccommend this product 100%.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why people come down so hard on this product for &#x27;ruining their skin&#x27;....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A) It says, on the bottle, to use only 1 to 3 times a week. Are you using it more? You&#x27;re hurting your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B) Anyone on the \\&quot;apricot pit powder is too harsh bleh bleh\\&quot; side....it says, on the bottle, that apricot pit isn&#x27;t even present. The exfoliants listed are Walnut Powder and Corn Meal. The only apricot in the product is APRICOT ---FRUIT--- EXTRACT. Read the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C) Anyone recommending plastic beads or sugar because it&#x27;s &#x27;rounder and gentler&#x27;...? Plastic is polluting the ocean horribly, and sugar...? Sugar has a crystalline structure. It is, by definition, the exact opposite of &#x27;round&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is bad on your skin, try a different product. You either used it too much, and too often, or you are allergic to apricot, walnuts, or corn. Don&#x27;t give the product a bad review before you understand what you&#x27;re reviewing. Just try, try again; you&#x27;ll find something that works for you! :)</li>
    <li> This product exfoliates really well. However it doesn&#x27;t magically remove pimples like I though it would before. But as an exfoliater, it&#x27;s a good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s more economical to buy the largest tube though.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this ever since forever. But sometimes I make a mistake and get a different type.. which i don&#x27;t like coz it&#x27;s not rough enough. this one is rough on the skin and leaves my skin SUPER CLEAN AND SMOOTH like a baby&#x27;s skin.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I use this in the shower because you are supposed to wash your face before using.  It does the trick, but definitely use once every day and work your way up steadily to the recommended dosage of 1-3 times daily because it can dry out your skin if you jump right into it. I use once a day on average, does the trick. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I use this to exfoliate about ever other day, and it make your face feel soft after! It does not take away current acne you have, but it does an amazing job preventing it. love this product</li>
    <li> This scrub will leave your face nice and smooth. It is one of the best scrub&#x27;s I&#x27;ve found. You will not regret trying this out!</li>
    <li> ESto es una mentira. Es el mismo producto que no dice SISS Formula y cuesta mas del doble. Est&amp;aacute;n enga&amp;ntilde;ando al publico. comprar simplemente el St Ives Blemish Apricot Scrub es suficiente.&lt;br /&gt;There is no extra swiss formula in this product. It is a lie. Is the same product as St. Ives Blemish &amp; Blackhead Control Apricot Scrub, but it costs three time more.</li>
    <li> It feels like it leaves leftover residue whenever I use it. It doesn&#x27;t clear my blackheads either so it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
    <li> Works great as a daily ex-foliate.  Not too expensive.  The apricot seed bits has just the right texture.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have been using St. Ives Apricot Scrub every day for years. My face doesn&#x27;t feel clean without it. It is an inexpensive but effective product that&#x27;s a staple in my regimen. I purchased it online for the first time last week. My precious product arrived promptly! I would definitely buy from this seller again. Thanks!</li>
    <li> The best for exfoilating! Plus it has the added medication for breakouts. I alternate this with cetaphil and my skin stays super soft.</li>
    <li> makes my face feel like a baby booty</li>
    <li> This product works great for me ... The more I use it the clearer my skin gets! Yay will buy again</li>
    <li> My name is Liz and I swear by this product. I&#x27;ve used this scrub for years and I have the skin of a thirty year old. I&#x27;m sixty. i use it everyday in the shower. My dermatologist thinks my skin is fantastic!! Thanks St. Ives</li>
    <li> I like it it takes more time though like 2-3 weeks to see results. It&#x27;s more of a exfoliating face wash. I also used exfoliating gloves w/ it.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It has a nice, fresh scent (not too powerful though), it is a fairly strong exfoliator, and also has some acne-fighting active ingredients to help keep your face free of blemishes. I use this every day and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel really clean</li>
    <li> I am so happy with my my Apricot Scrub. First used this when I was in the Middle East and I couldn&#x27;t stop using until now. It confuses me though this item to [[ASIN:B0000536Y7 St Ives Blemish Blackhead Control]] They are the same but this one is quite pricey for almost $7 while the other one is $2.99. I hope its the quantity but it doesn&#x27;t look like it.</li>
    <li> I just got this product today. i love the smell its not to strong. the beads inside the product really feels like it removing the dirt, Will be buying this again!</li>
    <li> Great facial scrub, does the trick to get your face washed &amp; feels great with my skin routine.</li>
    <li> I am 22 years old and have been pretty lucky to have had clear skin all of my life except for the occasional pimple or two during my time of the month. I have never struggled with serious acne until about 8 months ago. I don&#x27;t know what happened, but one day I started getting a few pimples and then within a month I was breaking out all over my cheeks, forehead, and chin. It was really distressing because I had NEVER had this kind of painful acne before in my life. Before and during this time I didn&#x27;t change anything in my diet, skincare routine, or environment so the only thing I could think of that caused the severe acne was maybe stress from school (other than that, I have no idea)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried many different products to get rid of the acne, expensive ones and cheap ones...... none of them worked. I tried using them for a good period of time to make sure I let it take effect too (like, a month). I was really subconscious of my face b/c of the scars that were left behind and the extremely noticeable acne. Well, I went to visit my sister last x-mas and she had this scrub. I used it while at her place and my skin felt really good after that week, so I bought a bottle when I got home. I have been using it every time I&#x27;m in the shower and within a few weeks my acne was reduced and within a month about 90% of it was gone. It&#x27;s been almost 3 months now and my acne is GONE, minus the occasional pimples again. I am sooooooooooo thankful for this product for saving my skin!!!! I&#x27;m still sad that I have all these scars left, but I&#x27;m hoping that they&#x27;ll fade over time as I continue to use this exfoliator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it has helped dramatically with my sudden acne onset, but I don&#x27;t think it has done anything w/ my blackheads (as many people have stated). Also, after using this product you should MOISTURIZE your skin!! The beads are taking off dead skin cells, so the freshly exposed skin may be more prone to some moisture loss if just left there. MOISTURIZE it!!! Plus, it should more readily absorb whatever you&#x27;re putting on it and be super soft afterwards. I would completely recommend this product for acne and smoothing out your skin (it&#x27;s a great exfoliator) :]!!!re readily absorb whatever you&#x27;re putting on it and be super soft afterwards.

    <li> This product made my skin irriated so I threw it away and used a no name face scrub. The no name face scrub worked better.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have the worst blackheads anyone could possibly imagine, and after a week of using this once a day there&#x27;s a significant improvement. It exfoliates and cleanses well, and makes my face feel clean and fresh.It&#x27;s gotten rid of most of my blackheads, prevented more from developing, and prevents pimples. This is a great product I will keep buying and recommend.</li>
    <li> This is currently my favorite face-care product. I get blackheads on my nose and this is really good at controlling them. It&#x27;s cream-based so I use neutrogena acne wash after it, but it&#x27;s done wonders for my pores. Really really great for unclogging pores and controlling acne.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 3 weeks now and after I get a break out, I cleanse, use this to exfoliate, tone, and moisturize and lose my pimples the next 2-3 days or so! It has a great texture so you&#x27;ll really feel the scrub on your face. This also helped my beach skin recover. I would totally get this product again after it runs out. Which would be in about a year or so. It&#x27;s a fairly big tube, I say and this was a really great buy.</li>
    <li> I swear by this stuff to give my face a fresh look. It takes off that top layer of old skin cells.  It is gentle and I use it about twice a week.</li>
    <li> My face feels good after washing with this.</li>
    <li> I use it every morning - keeps my skin clear and bright, without irritation. I&#x27;d also recommend using a toner and moisturizer after.</li>
    <li> The blemish and blackhead control version of the ST. Ives Apricot Scrub is a great face wash for removing makeup, and for exfoliating old skin from your face. This consistency of this formula is thicker than most face washes, and the particles in it that make up the abrasive scrub are densely packed, so you get a ton of scrubbing cream in just a small amount of product. Much more exfoliation power than in the original Apricot Scrub version. It&#x27;s great for removing long wearing, color-stay foundation, which tends to need something with a little extra scrubbing power in it to get all of it off of your skin. It cleans out pours and leaves skin super smooth, without drying it out. It works quite well, and it&#x27;s been a favorite face wash of mine for well over 10 years now.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I highly recommend it for those suffering from body acne.  This product is a harsh scrub that is ok to use once in a while for facial exfoliation, but I would definitely recommend it for regular use on your back and chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use the scrub: once a week on my face to get dead skin off. Every shower on my back and chest (to clear up breakouts) I put the product on a loofah with a handle for hard to reach areas on my back.  This is definitely the most effective way to clear back acne.  After I shower, I use Neutrogena Clear Body Spray on my back and chest for treatment.  It isn&#x27;t perfect but it works pretty darn well. It&#x27;s also great because it is salicylic acid so it does not bleach your clothing or towels.</li>
    <li> As Allure Readers know, this scrub is a great value and great product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 15 years and definitely recommend it -- a little exfoliation is necessary as part of a good skincare regimen.  Just remember not to scrub to hard/vigorously or you can break capillaries.</li>
    <li> This stuff is simple, inexpensive and it works!  I&#x27;ve just this for years and it really does work.  It exfoliates, clears the pores which helps with acne, brightens the skins and leaves my skin feeling great!  Over the years I&#x27;ve tried more expensive creams, cleansers and techniques - but I always come back to this.</li>
    <li> I have been using St. Ives Apricot Scrub Blemish Control for over 10 years now, and I can honestly say that it works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;I have never been prone to acne, but did get the once in a while pimple here and there. I wouldn&#x27;t say this product works in that sense, but it exfoliates the skin very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the third step in my shower routine, and every single day it leaves my face feeling silky and smooth. I find that it&#x27;s the best product to use before using any foundation regime as well as it will remove all of the dead skin on your face leaving you with a clean platform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it as a facial mask, even though nothing indicates to do so. I actually found this routine by accident when I was younger. I was washing my face after getting out of bed and had an urgent phone call which I couldn&#x27;t ignore. After the hour and a half phone call, I went in to rinse my face off and found that it was SUPER clean, super smooth, and FLAWLESS. Ever since then I apply the mask once per week and allow it to sit for a few hours. Since I have been doing that routine, I only get that one pimple every 6 months or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very pleasant scent that leaves you feeling refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only advice is to make sure when you rinse it that you rinse it ALL as it is very easy to leave some specks of sand behind and find them behind your ears later!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. And it smells nice!</li>
    <li> I know it says to exfoliate about every other day but honestly I can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a long day of work and yoga.. my face is grungy feeling and this stuff gets it back into prime condition. If you feel it is too rough, try using your fingertips instead of your palm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m probably on my 30th bottle/tub. Loyal customer for life!</li>
    <li> It always leaves my face so soft after using it and it smells great! I could not live without it. Must try :)</li>
    <li> Never came its been a few weeks I got my item I bought with it but never got this. Bull crap</li>
    <li> This product does what it is suppose to do and that is exfoliate. And much much more.</li>
    <li> I really love this product! It exfoliates well and leaves my face feeling great. I use it every other day to once a day.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from this provider and it arrived on time and works great.  I would reommend using this product and provider again.  Happy!</li>
