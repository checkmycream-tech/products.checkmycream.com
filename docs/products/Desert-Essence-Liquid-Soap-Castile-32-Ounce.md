      <li>just LOVE it!</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>But, if Bronners wasn&#x27;t available I would happily use this product.</li>
      <li>Feels nice.</li>
      <li>Lathers nicely.</li>
      <li>Nice smell.</li>
      <li>A nice liquid Castile soap.</li>
      <li>I tried this at my daughter&#x27;s house and really liked it.  </li>
      <li>Sudsy, smells great, leaves me clean without over drying my skin.</li>
      <li>This has a good smell and works fine.</li>
      <li>It uses completely Natural Ingredients, which is excellent for your skin.</li>
      <li>Since Dr. Bronners is probably the most popular castile soap in America, my review will compare the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It suds up nice, rinses way better than Dr. Bronner&#x27;s and does not contain tocopherols like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Anyhow, if you are into this kind of soap, then you will probably be pleased with this.</li>
      <li>I shared a bit with family and friends to try and they all love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fortunately, that isn&#x27;t even an issue, if you purchase a foam pump!</li>
      <li>I is cheaper and more softening than Dr. Bonner&#x27;s Castile soap in my opinion</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Washing his hands in peace after getting this product! :)</li>
      <li>Love the tea tree scent it has.</li>
      <li>I love this soap.  </li>
      <li>That makes it better for your skin and</li>
      <li>I had always used Dr. Bronners before &amp; love the castile soap.</li>
      <li>That probably means that they use more tea tree oil in their product.  </li>
      <li>The soap is okay</li>
      <li>so I probably won&#x27;t buy more.</li>
      <li>I will purchase again,highly recommended!:)</li>
      <li>I have used Dr. Bronners castile tea tree soap many times over the years.  </li>
      <li>I use it for so many things.</li>
      <li>I love tea tree.</li>
      <li>I love knowing that i am not covering my body in anymore chemicals than I have to.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed it.</li>
      <li>and I like having better skin</li>
      <li>Then, you don&#x27;t have to be concerned with the side effects of more expensive/lab created formulas (i.e. retinol and sun danger).</li>
      <li>and I was very pleased with the mild scent.</li>
      <li>Smells very clean and tea tree-ish and doesn&#x27;t harm our skin.</li>
      <li>in particular is a great liquid soap that is very versatile and at a good price.</li>
      <li>It works great for my sensitive skin, I have been using it for over 4 years.  </li>
      <li>A great natural soap.</li>
      <li>The route I&#x27;ve taken is that I bought a super cheap (&amp;#60;$1) foaming hand soap dispenser, poured the original soap out, cleaned it out, and filled it with the good stuff.</li>
      <li>If you aren&#x27;t familiar with tea tree oil buy this and get acquainted.</li>
      <li>I can keep the healthy flora on my hands and keep my hands clean.</li>
      <li>It has a strong bush scent.</li>
      <li>Strong smell because of the tea tree oil</li>
      <li>Absolutely amazing, but much thinner than liquid soap you&#x27;re used to!</li>
      <li>My infant daughter has a primary immune deficiency</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy about receiving the item with the safety/freshness seal pierced open though.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fragrance free, plant based, and it doesn&#x27;t clog my soap dispensers the way Dr. Bronners does.  </li>
      <li>This is important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Smells nice and cleans really well.</li>
      <li>I think this product smells great, but apparently it&#x27;s not for everyone.</li>
      <li>This is an amazing soap and I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>you aren&#x27;t familiar with tea tree oil</li>
      <li>Environmentally friendly.</li>
      <li>Will recommend as a good by and it is cheap per fluid ounce.</li>
      <li>It is watery, but rinses really clean.</li>
      <li>Okay, so this soap has a few things in its favor: natural/biodegradable, great value, and works well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this to use in some homemade cleansing products. It&#x27;s a really wonderful soap. Smells nice and cleans really well. I used some in a homemade Magic Eraser recipe and it works terrific. I love it.</li>
    <li> So happy to have found this stuff!  My infant daughter has a primary immune deficiency so my husband and I wash our hands A TON.  My hands were becoming cracked, dry, and bleeding until I found this stuff and it&#x27;s rated great on EWG which is another must-have for our home!</li>
    <li> Tea tree oil used to be a disinfectant for surgeries in Australia. I use this soap for my hands and countertops in the kitchen. It is watery, but rinses really clean. I have (recently) read warnings to keep tea tree oil away from children and food, however, so I don&#x27;t wash vegetables with it (anymore) or use it in the bathroom. The tea tree oil in this product is diluted with the castile, so is most likely safer than the pure oil. I find it very gentle to my hands, and I am a frequent hand washer with sensitive hands.</li>
    <li> Wow, I am compelled to write a review after reading the previous reviewer&#x27;s comment.  I have been using this stuff for about 4 years now and I think it&#x27;s great!  It is made of completely natural ingredients earning the highest score by EWC skin deep (a non-profit that rates the dangers of chemicals in cosmetics), it&#x27;s cheaper than Dr. Bronners, and it&#x27;s not at all watered down as the previous reviewer writes.  I mix half soap half water in a smaller pump bottle and this large container usually lasts me almost six months--and my watered down mixture is perfectly sufficient.  I also find that other products made by this brand are completely natural.  They use truly natural ingredients--if you actually take the time to read the ingredients list and compare to other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products I think you&#x27;ll find this brand is better in that department.  I also use their ginger toothpaste and their unscented face wash and moisturizer.  I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff! I use it for face, body, and hair.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  Works great for the body and the hair!</li>
    <li> great for laundry and hand soap.</li>
    <li> Good price, but watery soap. Not thick like the doctor&#x27;s brand.</li>
    <li> I tried this at my daughter&#x27;s house and really liked it.  Get some.  Try it.  I&#x27;ll betcha you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> Love the Desert Essence products!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that this had Tea Tree oil, I wanted unscented. The soap is okay but the label is hard to see so I probably won&#x27;t buy more. If you like castile soap with tea tree oil then this is a good soap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what creosote smells like, but I know that the bush grows in the desert.  I believe that is what they used for the \\&quot;desert essence.\\&quot;  Yuck.  It smells awful.  And the soap is very watered down.  Not a good value in my opinion on either count.</li>
    <li> Gets all grime off. Great for working hands that get real dirty or greasy.</li>
    <li> This soap is quite thin. I used it up rather quickly because it&#x27;s almost like water.... Not bad though. Nice smell. Good lather. Feels nice. Mild. Could have lasted longer though.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years, and hope to continue using it for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is wonderful on the skin. It is pure and simple. OK, it does have a strong perfume that you have to get used to, but that doesn&#x27;t take long (if you give it a chance).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I give it five stars with no hesitation.</li>
    <li> A little runny but I love it!</li>
    <li> Best price for the size.</li>
    <li> I found this soap in the EWG database and purchased it here.  We use it as bathroom had soap, and really like it.  It smells great and leaves the hands feeling wonderful.</li>
    <li> I like this soap. Good price. Lasts a long time. Doesn&#x27;t leave my hands dry. Environmentally friendly.</li>
    <li> I really like this the only drawback is that it is as thin as water.</li>
    <li> They changed the picture on this product. The picture I saw had a hand pump dispenser. The soap I got was in a bottle with a cap. It&#x27;s so runny and not thick that when I poured it into a soap dispenser it squirts like 10 feet. I don&#x27;t dig the smell either. Very disappointed. The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get a 1 star and actually I would rate it a 2.5 star is because it was a good price and it does work well.</li>
    <li> I need to get a foaming dispenser for this, as it is thin, but it has a pleasant fragrance and cleans well and is rated highly on the ewg as containing no harmful ingredients.</li>
    <li> I wanted a bubble bath, but I can&#x27;t blame the product for not being one (doesn&#x27;t say it is one.) The label is different from advertised. Smells very clean and tea tree-ish and doesn&#x27;t harm our skin.</li>
    <li> Great product. It really burns your eyes if it gets in accidentally. But it ladder fast and cleans well. I use it to wash my hair mostly and sometimes to bath or as a facial cleanser. Either way, it does a complete job. About its constituency, I think its good enough for me, and it not watery for me or anything. It has a strong bush scent. It is Bio-degradable, which is all that really matters to me.</li>
    <li> A hand soap without antibacterial added.  I can keep the healthy flora on my hands and keep my hands clean.</li>
    <li> Strong smell because of the tea tree oil but I expected that.  I wasn&#x27;t happy about receiving the item with the safety/freshness seal pierced open though.  Still using it because it&#x27;s soap...</li>
    <li> This soap was too watery. It made a mess.</li>
    <li> Okay, so this soap has a few things in its favor: natural/biodegradable, great value, and works well. The only con I really have with it is the absolutely horrid smell. But, if you can get past that, I recommend it. It might just be me (or the tea tree oil...), but I really have a hard time with it. I have ordered this twice, however, because it is the best dandruff and skin care soap I have found. Then, you don&#x27;t have to be concerned with the side effects of more expensive/lab created formulas (i.e. retinol and sun danger). I mixed a little with my shampoo and it killed the dandruff completely with only a few uses. I use it on my face to control acne. The only downside there is the awful smell is just that much closer to your nose...Maybe adding tea tree oil to my better smelling soap will be just as effective (and smell just as awful), but I haven&#x27;t tried it and I like having better skin, so this is pretty worth it. Give it a try! If you hate the smell of it, use it for cleaning windows or something that smells worse. :)</li>
    <li> This is much cheaper and of same or better quality than Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.  The only thing is that I got a bottle instead of the pump bottle as pictured.  Anyhow, if you are into this kind of soap, then you will probably be pleased with this.</li>
    <li> Too watery. I use a lot of it in one wash so it gets used up fast. Probably wont buy it again</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I use it for bathing, shampooing, and just for hand washing. No more itchy, dry skin or scalp from the SLS and parabens in most products.</li>
    <li> Very thin consistency as others have noted. Add a little to each laundry load and it gets out the crud from working on car and truck. Works great as body soap too.</li>
    <li> I tried using this for shampoo, but it didn&#x27;t exactly get my hair clean. I was not impressed by the sudsing of it, either.</li>
    <li> Where did they get the idea this product came in a pump dispenser?  I wish it had!  I like Castile soap but I really do not care for the Desert Essence scent.</li>
    <li> I love tea tree.I use it for so many things.This has a good smell and works fine.</li>
    <li> So far I have used this soap to make dish soap and shampoo. I wanted tea tree for antibacterial properties but was nervous of the scent as I have used an over the counter shampoo with tea tree oil that just smelled chemically and almost rancid.  This one smells amazing!  I don&#x27;t even add other oil to my shampoo as I like this scent so much. Lathers nicely.</li>
    <li> I think this product smells great, but apparently it&#x27;s not for everyone. Overall, it&#x27;s a basic, all-natural, fairly mild face wash that comes at a really great price (cheaper than Dr. Bronners, as another reviewer points out). I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s not to like, really.</li>
    <li> This has nicer ingredients than the Dr. Bronners liquid soap, but is only half as concentrated or even less. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Strange new scented addition to what was a very good tea tree oil castile soap.  What is it?</li>
    <li> The teatree oil smells great and cleans well.  However, the soap seems too thin and requires a larger amount to do the same job as other brands. Overall not bad but could be more concentrated.</li>
    <li> It works great for my sensitive skin, I have been using it for over 4 years.  Will recommend as a good by and it is cheap per fluid ounce.</li>
    <li> I use this liquid soap as shower gel,hand soap,face wash,and is perfect for my oily skin! It&#x27;s a bit on watery side but it does perfect job. I will purchase again,highly recommended!:)</li>
    <li> The protective seal was removed.  The soap is very diluted, not concentrated.</li>
    <li> I have had oily skin and acne for 30 yrs.  This soap twice a day keeps acne to a minimum. It has been my favorite for several years</li>
    <li> Use for homemade cleaning products, works well.</li>
    <li> This liquid soap is the best you will every find! It uses completely Natural Ingredients, which is excellent for your skin. Not only that, it is not watered down like a lot of other products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will find that this Desert Essence Castile Liquid Soap is All Natural and Better than another other Brand. That makes it better for your skin and face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Amazon has a good price. So I purchased the product from them and will not regret it!</li>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s natural. The scent is mild, although I&#x27;m not crazy about tea tree. I add a few drops of bergamot essential oil and it&#x27;s better. I remove one star because it&#x27;s too watery.</li>
    <li> Great hand wash! Love the tea tree scent it has. Baby uses it to wash his hands after and before meals. Happy that he&#x27;s not having too much harsh chemicals goingon his hands in his early years of life.  Washing his hands in peace after getting this product! :)</li>
    <li> Does not have a cap that you can squeeze out like the other brands and doesn&amp;#34;t seem to lather quite as well</li>
    <li> A nice liquid Castile soap. It&#x27;s thinner than others I&#x27;ve gotten, which sometimes causes me to pour too much out, but that&#x27;s my only nitpick. Note the scent, it&#x27;s tea tree. I was expecting something a little different, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> I use this Castile soap as a base to make liquid hand soap with essential oils like lavender and eucalyptus.  The soap already has a little tea tree oil in it which is a great anti-bacterial oil.  I found this soap to be a much better quality than some other soaps like Bronners which I found to be light and runny.</li>
    <li> This is the best soap ever.  I use this soap from Head to Toes.&lt;br /&gt;Best thing is you can cut it by half with water and it still works great.  I pour into an old face wash pump bottle.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing, but much thinner than liquid soap you&#x27;re used to!</li>
    <li> Use it every day! Good soap! a little pricy! Can regular costumer get a coupon once in a while, please? haha*_*</li>
    <li> Awesome, healthy product. I use it for shampoo, soap and shaving. Leaves no soap scum in shower! Lathers well but you need to work it. No unhealthy chemicals at ALL! Have my whole family using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I used a bunch of this brand&#x27;s products and I have been impressed. I like how you can pronounce most of the ingredients and it is supposedly all natural.</li>
    <li> I prefer to use natural soap as much as possible.  I have liquid soap dispensers in the kitchen and bathrooms and use this in all of them.  I have read the ingredients list in this and all products I buy and find no harsh chemicals in this at all.  This is important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is economical and this large 32 ounce bottle lasts me for months and months.  It leaves my hands soft and smooth.  I admit I don&#x27;t use it for bathing as at the moment I am hooked on Pure Fiji Coconut Soap, for it&#x27;s smell and the inclusion of coconut oil for it&#x27;s skin softening properties.  But for my liquid soap dispensers, this is all I use.  I is cheaper and more softening than Dr. Bonner&#x27;s Castile soap in my opinion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like all the Desert Essence products I have tried.  All the ingredients in this line are always natural, without harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> Love the all natural clean.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing soap and I highly recommend it. I&#x27;ve been using it as a body wash and it gets me nice and clean without making my skin feel dry. In fact, my skin has never been so soft, so consistently and I never use any type of moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is that the soap is fairly runny. Fortunately, that isn&#x27;t even an issue, if you purchase a foam pump! The route I&#x27;ve taken is that I bought a super cheap (&amp;#60;$1) foaming hand soap dispenser, poured the original soap out, cleaned it out, and filled it with the good stuff. Could not be happier, now that I&#x27;ve made that change!</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with this soap. I actually like it better than  dr bronners. I use a foaming soap dispenser and fill it 1/4 full of castile soap and the rest with water and it seems to be thicker than dr bronners. I don&#x27;t mind the tea tree oil smell and it doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
    <li> A great natural soap. Sudsy, smells great, leaves me clean without over drying my skin. Works Wonderfully as a shampoo!!! Not recomended as a bubble bath, but great as a bath, fills the bathroom with tea tree goodness. Do not mix with Epsom salts!!!!! It will mak the suds filmy!!!!</li>
    <li> Have used Desert Essence Tea Tree Oil Face wash for years and appreciate the Dessert Essence products.&lt;br /&gt;This in particular is a great liquid soap that is very versatile and at a good price. Less strong smell than the D.E. face wash and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin as much either.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a liquid soap so it is runny but you can put it into old contact lens solution bottles which can then be dispensed as drops or squirted.&lt;br /&gt;A few drops go a long way... it can also be diluted with water to make it last longer.  Works great when diluted and put into as foaming soap dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;You can google hundreds of dilution methods and solutions that can be made using castile liquid soap, this is also one of the less expensive and more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; castile soaps. In addition it contains tea tree oil which has natural cleansing and antibacterial qualities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you aren&#x27;t familiar with tea tree oil it is a bit odd for a smell at first but it will grow on you... plus it rinses off. If you aren&#x27;t familiar with tea tree oil buy this and get acquainted. P.s. you&#x27;ll be recommending this to someone else soon enough.</li>
    <li> First time buying this brand&#x27;s castile soa and I was very pleased with the mild scent. I had previously  bought other  desert essence products  and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed it.</li>
    <li> Smell is gross, it&#x27;s very thin and not nearly as good as other brands such as dr bronners.</li>
    <li> Great product, nice aroma, very fine hand cleaner. Plus it&#x27;s got the antiseptic Tea Tree Oil in it: you can&#x27;t beat that!! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This soap is great, I&#x27;ve been using it for years as an all-purpose hand/shower soap &amp; shampoo.  It&#x27;s fragrance free, plant based, and it doesn&#x27;t clog my soap dispensers the way Dr. Bronners does.  I dilute it with water 5:1 for hand soap.</li>
    <li> I am a long time Dr. Bronners user and decided to give this a try (just for a change of pace).  I have used Dr. Bronners castile tea tree soap many times over the years.  Since Dr. Bronners is probably the most popular castile soap in America, my review will compare the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say this is milder than Bronners.  But, it is also more watered down than Bronners.  You need to use more of this to get the same amount of suds.  The smell is similar to Bronners tea tree, but Bronners has a stronger tea tree scent.  That probably means that they use more tea tree oil in their product.  Desert Essence might be better for sensitive skin (or if you use it on your face/head), since it does seem milder.  But, I personally think the Bronners seems like a higher quality product for essentially the same cost.  But, if Bronners wasn&#x27;t available I would happily use this product.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castille soap. I use for a foam pump, washing floors and to make shampoo. It suds up nice, rinses way better than Dr. Bronner&#x27;s and does not contain tocopherols like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> where has this product been all my life - after trial and error - use and lots of money spent on various skin cleansers. This is the best. Its&#x27; made of natural ingredients (big plus), it feels good, cleans good and does not leave a creamy film nor does it leave your face feeing dry. I would highly recommend. I shared a bit with family and friends to try and they all love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I had always used Dr. Bronners before &amp; love the castile soap. I was disappointed when I switched to this brand as it seems more watered down and does not suds up well.</li>
    <li> This thing cuts through grease with ease. Great for after car work and after working with meat or chicken. Too liquid for comfortable use on regular hand dispensers.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a cheaper alternative to my normal Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile soap. Yes, it&#x27;s watery. It&#x27;s supposed to be. In comparison to bronner&#x27;s soap, this gets five stars. It&#x27;s basically identical except the scent is a bit different. This is perfect to use as a face soap, diluted in a foam pump dispenser.</li>
    <li> This is a great soap, but it seems to be too thin. I bought this as a Dr. B replacement, but it seems to be too watery for some uses. I like it, but I go through it faster than other liquid castile soaps I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> Lightning fast and secure shipping! Great vendor. Fabulous natural product that is thin, but I use a Japanese exfoliating wash/bath cloth (makes ANY liquid soap last alot longer), not a regular wash cloth. I also use a pump I saved from another product, so I can just use this 32oz. bottle without transferring to another container. No unwanted chemicals in this product.Does not irritate or dry out skin. Can&#x27;t get any cleaner than this!</li>
    <li> Castile soap is not thick, but a much thinner liquid.  Many complain, but really, a little bit goes a long way!  I use it for both shampoo and body wash.  I had previously used castile soap without tea tree oil and was concerned about odor, but it is just fine.</li>
    <li> I love knowing that i am not covering my body in anymore chemicals than I have to.  This is supposed to help with skin issues.  I don&#x27;t have any but my husband suffers with occasional bacterial breakouts (via the Dermatologist) and I hate him using all those prescription creams.  I have yet to notice anything as the flare ups aren&#x27;t consistent.  i tried using it in my hair instead of shampoo.  And it worked just fine except that I have long blond hair and I could not condition enough to keep my hair from turning to fuzz after sleeping on it.  I don&#x27;t want to wash my hair every single day, but with this routine I had no choice.  I sadly have gone back to regular shampoo and conditioner and just use this on my body and for hand soap.  It is really thin like water so I cleaned out a facial cleanser bottle with a pump and put it in that and wrote on it with a sharpie.  I can now control how much I use and can do it with one hand.  Works perfectly.  we will always use this.  Very satisfied with the product</li>
