      <li>Best that we&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>My very fair skinned grandchildren use it and it keeps them fully protected.  </li>
      <li>Works great, non greasy.</li>
      <li>Neither are greasy and give great coverage-</li>
      <li>Love this sunblock!!</li>
      <li>Very effective.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of confidence on this brand, La Roche Posay, and I buy all my moisturizers from them, but this sunscreen makes me break out... and yet, according to many dermatologists Anthelios is the best UVA/B protection on the market.</li>
      <li>I did my research and looked for a good &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>I have not tried the spray, but the cream is exceptional.  </li>
      <li>Great product originally recommended from a pharmacy in Mykonos, Greece.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for my sensitive skin and sun-sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>It is so easy to apply and re-apply!</li>
      <li>Glad to have found it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>This may become my favorite for sweaty activities.  </li>
      <li>I love the spray.</li>
      <li>Perfect for the entire family.</li>
      <li>something that was hypoallergenic and protected UVA/UVB along with being able to use while swimming/water.  </li>
      <li>It does not migrate into my eyes like many sun products do.  </li>
      <li>The spray formula is very easy to use and great on sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and light as a feather!</li>
      <li>Great for those with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>and they do not have a strong odor of any sort.</li>
      <li>It left me with a beautiful brown tan…no redness, no sunburn, no acne breakout.  </li>
      <li>It has good photostable UVA and UVB filters, goes on easily, even on hairy skin, and hasn&#x27;t caused a reaction so far.</li>
      <li>Has no scent, except for a light \\&quot;sunscreen\\&quot; smell.</li>
      <li>Free of chemicals and parabans, etc. -</li>
      <li>This stuff is fabulous, soaking in to &amp;#34;nearly dry&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>the non greasy feel, 50 SPF, virtually non existent smell, and (non aerosol) pump spray which makes it quick and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>My new favorite!</li>
      <li>Great sun blocker...will protect you...just be aware that will wash away with water and sweat if you don&#x27;t give it enough time to absorb...</li>
      <li>Goes into the skin quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
      <li>Overall very pleased.</li>
      <li>Love La Roche products and especially this sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>I felt safe from the sun with this on and will definitely buy again.</li>
      <li>I applied this to her shoulders, neck, back, stomach and asked her to put her tank top on.  </li>
      <li>Yet, it is available in Europe where they are careful enough to ban many of the food dyes we use here in the US!  </li>
      <li>The only ding is the plastic cap which is easily lose-able.  </li>
      <li>The spray bottle is easy to use but you do still need to rub it in as it is a white sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>almost like I had applied too much - but no, when I started to wipe it off I noticed that she was having a severe allergic reaction.  </li>
      <li>Fast service.</li>
      <li>Absolute block</li>
      <li>It was kind of hard to find, BTW.  </li>
      <li>My daughter has always had sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve been cautious about what I put on her</li>
      <li>I now exclusively use this on myself and 9 month old daughter.  </li>
      <li>If your child is sensitive DO NOT PURCHASE.  </li>
      <li>(we bought it in London), so you are likely getting a decent deal as well.  </li>
      <li>so regular (free) shipping is a few weeks, while expedited shipping over $100.</li>
      <li>We tried countless high end products, but this is the only ingredient that works.  </li>
      <li>I used to use Blue Lizard Sensitive sunscreen.  </li>

<li> We tried countless high end products, but this is the only ingredient that works.  </li>
<li> I used to use Blue Lizard Sensitive sunscreen.  </li>
<li> It was hard to get the lotion to pump at first.</li>
<li> We spent several hours on the beach and not a single part of me burned.</li>
<li> This was a COMPLETE waste of money I wish I could get a refund and send it back.  </li>
<li> As long as you apply this evenly, you will have an ample amount of protection for a long time.</li>
<li> Only a few times did I get that white pasty look and that was because I had really layered it on or had gotten too lazy to rub it in all the way.  </li>
<li> She came back less than a minute later and said mom - what&#x27;s this stuff on my arm?  </li>
<li> Recommended by my doctor, rubs in dry, and lasts for a long time--more than 24 hrs!</li>
<li> The only place I did break out a little was my face, but it could have been from the heat and sweat.</li>
<li> It sinks in soon after application, and so you will not feel sticky or have sand sticking all over you.</li>
<li> The skin is not as aged or rough.  </li>
<li> One can feel, and see differences between it and other sunscreens.  </li>
<li> I also have problems with contact dermatitis and this product did not cause an outbreak as other sunscreens have.</li>
<li> My 12 yr old daughter suffers occasional outbreaks of eczema and she had no problems either.</li>
<li> but it gets well hidden with makeup</li>
<li> It rubs in completely and doesn’t leave any weird bluish/white residue on your skin.  </li>
<li> Once the cap is lost, it becomes messy.</li>
<li> As far as price goes, it is about this expensive in England</li>
<li> I posted pics - they don&#x27;t show the extent (I was crying when I took them)</li>
<li> It is technically not available in the USA because the FDA hasn&#x27;t approved the Mexoryl XL.  </li>
<li> Having previously used this in Europe, I had a hard time finding it here in the U.S.  </li>
<li> I gave her a Benadryl and made her a doctors appointment because it was really awful on her shoulders back and forearms.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Non greasy&lt;br /&gt;Does the job&lt;br /&gt;Goes on well under make up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does give that whitish hue like any sunscreen does...but it gets well hidden with makeup</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended I use this. I love the spray. I also use anthelios for the face with mexoryl SX. Neither are greasy and give great coverage- and they do not have a strong odor of any sort.</li>
    <li> Having previously used this in Europe, I had a hard time finding it here in the U.S.  It&#x27;s not even on the La Roche Posay site. Glad to have found it on Amazon.  I like everything about this sunscreen--the non greasy feel, 50 SPF, virtually non existent smell, and (non aerosol) pump spray which makes it quick and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fabulous, soaking in to &amp;#34;nearly dry&amp;#34; state.  It does not migrate into my eyes like many sun products do.  The only drawback is this ships from Germany so regular (free) shipping is a few weeks, while expedited shipping over $100.</li>
    <li> Great for those with sensitive skin. Absolute block but still let you get a tan. Great product originally recommended from a pharmacy in Mykonos, Greece.  Did not burn and got some color!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Recommended by my doctor, rubs in dry, and lasts for a long time--more than 24 hrs! Immediately improves the look and feel of my aging skin .</li>
    <li> Goes into the skin quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of confidence on this brand, La Roche Posay, and I buy all my moisturizers from them, but this sunscreen makes me break out... and yet, according to many dermatologists Anthelios is the best UVA/B protection on the market. It simply does not get along with my skin.</li>
    <li> Love this sunblock!! It goes on smooth and light as a feather! Protects great too! My new favorite!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Very effective. One can feel, and see differences between it and other sunscreens.  The skin is not as aged or rough.  The only ding is the plastic cap which is easily lose-able.  Once the cap is lost, it becomes messy.</li>
    <li> Wrote a similar review for the face lotion (same brand).  I did my research and looked for a good &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; sunscreen.  Free of chemicals and parabans, etc. - something that was hypoallergenic and protected UVA/UVB along with being able to use while swimming/water.  My daughter has always had sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve been cautious about what I put on her - I thought I did my research.  I applied this to her shoulders, neck, back, stomach and asked her to put her tank top on.  She came back less than a minute later and said mom - what&#x27;s this stuff on my arm?  It had balled up on her skin - almost like I had applied too much - but no, when I started to wipe it off I noticed that she was having a severe allergic reaction.  I immediately put her in the shower to get it off her.  Red bumps everywhere.  I gave her a Benadryl and made her a doctors appointment because it was really awful on her shoulders back and forearms.  This was a COMPLETE waste of money I wish I could get a refund and send it back.  If your child is sensitive DO NOT PURCHASE.  I understand - not everyone is going to have this type of reaction.  But for the price of this sunscreen, beware!  If you haven&#x27;t used it before - beware that it might not work and it might hurt you!  I posted pics - they don&#x27;t show the extent (I was crying when I took them)</li>
    <li> Our dermatologist recommended it.  My very fair skinned grandchildren use it and it keeps them fully protected.  Best that we&#x27;ve ever used.  The spray formula is very easy to use and great on sensitive skin.  Perfect for the entire family.</li>
    <li> Fast service. Overall very pleased.</li>
    <li> I received this product promptly.  It was hard to get the lotion to pump at first.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my sensitive skin and sun-sensitive skin.  It left me with a beautiful brown tan…no redness, no sunburn, no acne breakout.  The spray bottle is easy to use but you do still need to rub it in as it is a white sunscreen.  I applied every 2 hours while at the beach for 7 days and used up the entire bottle.  Only a few times did I get that white pasty look and that was because I had really layered it on or had gotten too lazy to rub it in all the way.  I felt safe from the sun with this on and will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This may become my favorite for sweaty activities.  It has good photostable UVA and UVB filters, goes on easily, even on hairy skin, and hasn&#x27;t caused a reaction so far. Has no scent, except for a light \\&quot;sunscreen\\&quot; smell. You can feel it on your skin if you pay attention, but it is not at all greasy.  The 200ml volume makes it easier for us to share as a family.  As far as price goes, it is about this expensive in England (we bought it in London), so you are likely getting a decent deal as well.  It was kind of hard to find, BTW.  Only one pharmacy at South Kensington station had it.  Didn&#x27;t find it anywhere else, including Marks &amp; Spencer, or cosmetic shops.</li>
    <li> Only sunscreen that never makes my eyes sting.&lt;br /&gt;No scent and never greasy.</li>
    <li> Works great, non greasy.</li>
    <li> I used to use Blue Lizard Sensitive sunscreen.  I read a Yahoo article that rated Zinc Oxide sunscreens and this was one of their recommendations.  I now exclusively use this on myself and 9 month old daughter.  It rubs in completely and doesn’t leave any weird bluish/white residue on your skin.  The spray bottle is also nice-makes it easier to apply.</li>
    <li> Love La Roche products and especially this sunscreen.  It is so easy to apply and re-apply!</li>
    <li> Great sun blocker...will protect you...just be aware that will wash away with water and sweat if you don&#x27;t give it enough time to absorb...</li>
    <li> We spent several hours on the beach and not a single part of me burned. As long as you apply this evenly, you will have an ample amount of protection for a long time. I did not go into the water, so there was no need to reapply. It sinks in soon after application, and so you will not feel sticky or have sand sticking all over you. I also have problems with contact dermatitis and this product did not cause an outbreak as other sunscreens have. My 12 yr old daughter suffers occasional outbreaks of eczema and she had no problems either. It worked for the entire family. The only place I did break out a little was my face, but it could have been from the heat and sweat. Next time I will try their product made specifically for facial skin just in case.</li>
    <li> Anthelios with Mexoryl xl is the ONLY product that works for my mother with a severe sun ALLERGY.  She doesn&#x27;t burn, she gets hives.  Her internist, several years ago told her that she would always have to stay out of the sun.  The Dr.&#x27;s mother had the same allergy, and she had to give up gardening because people with this allergy can not be in the sun for even 15 minutes unprotected.  We tried countless high end products, but this is the only ingredient that works.  I found out about it on a message board for persons with sun allergy.  It is technically not available in the USA because the FDA hasn&#x27;t approved the Mexoryl XL.  Yet, it is available in Europe where they are careful enough to ban many of the food dyes we use here in the US!  I&#x27;ve been ordering from Canada for years, cheaper on the internet than in the Canadian stores.  I have not tried the spray, but the cream is exceptional.  Ordered the spray today.</li>
