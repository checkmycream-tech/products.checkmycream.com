### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Nioxin products for years and it&#x27;s wonderful to get it by mail rather than seek out a location to purchase it.</li>
      <li>Wonderful on my hair.</li>
      <li>This is a very good product for people who have problems with their hair falling out.</li>
      <li>I think the product is great.</li>
      <li>Great conditioner.  </li>
      <li>The Nioxin systems seem to work the best for me and I have tried many products for thinning hair.  </li>
      <li>Good price for this size of a bottle.</li>
      <li>And the nice thing about Nioxin products is that if don&#x27;t stop using them, or skip days (say, you forget products because you&#x27;re out of town)</li>
      <li>I LOVE this conditioner now.</li>
      <li>Worked much better than my expectations.</li>
      <li>product works pretty good</li>
      <li>I was really hoping this product would be good for my hair.</li>
      <li>I have thinning and fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I use this conditioner as part of the Nioxin 3 part system for my fine, thinning hair.</li>
      <li>I have been using nioxin system 2 since I have fine hair.</li>
      <li>After trying this method, I have to say that I have noticed a huge difference in my hair.</li>
      <li>My hair was always fine, but never thin.  </li>
      <li>My hair feels soft and looks healthy.  </li>
      <li>I find Joico KPak conditioners to be good for everyday, and Aussie 3 minute miracle or even heavier hair masks once or twice a week.</li>
      <li>After I dye my hair it is important to switch to system 4 for color preservation and have the same volume effect.</li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>I have previously used other Nioxin products, NOT sold by this company, but by Wella with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It is not very moisturizing, so what I do is rub it into my scalp and the first inch or so of my hair, then use a very moisturizing conditioner on my ends and working up to the rest of my hair (my hair falls right by my shoulders).</li>
      <li>It no longer tangles, and does seem fuller near the roots where I apply this product.</li>
      <li>- my point is that I find the Nioxin conditioner and other products to work better than any other hair growing/thickener on the market, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  </li>
      <li>This system makes my hair feel thicker without becoming sticky, stiff or heavy.  </li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used Nioxin products for years and it&#x27;s wonderful to get it by mail rather than seek out a location to purchase it.</li>
    <li> I have thinning and fine hair.  This system makes my hair feel thicker without becoming sticky, stiff or heavy.  It has also helped me solve my problem of an unruly cowlick!</li>
    <li> bought for thinning hair. product works pretty good my hair still falls out a lot but have noticed a little difference</li>
    <li> I have thin hair, probably because I have thyroid issues. My hair is chemically treated, so I decided to give this conditioner a try. I have previously used other Nioxin products, NOT sold by this company, but by Wella with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading through other reviews, I saw where one lady used this conditioner only on her roots, and another conditioner on the rest of her hair. After trying this method, I have to say that I have noticed a huge difference in my hair. It no longer tangles, and does seem fuller near the roots where I apply this product. Now after several months of using this product in this manner I can see a much bigger difference between the days I apply this product and the days I don&#x27;t. I LOVE this conditioner now. I would definitely recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I have been using nioxin system 2 since I have fine hair. It does decrease hair loss overtime. Not sure it will improve hair growth though. After I dye my hair it is important to switch to system 4 for color preservation and have the same volume effect.</li>
    <li> Working well.  Had thinning hair due to medication, seems to be working well to at least slow the hair loss a bit.  Worked much better than my expectations.</li>
    <li> I will not live with out this product. Wonderful on my hair.</li>
    <li> Good price for this size of a bottle. Have been using this product for a half a year definitely made my hair stronger.</li>
    <li> Not worth the time or money. So no appreciable difference in growth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what I expected.</li>
    <li> Made my hair lifeless and very flat. I was really hoping this product would be good for my hair. Quite disappointing.</li>
    <li> The Nioxin systems seem to work the best for me and I have tried many products for thinning hair.  I have been using Nioxin for at least 10 yrs.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product for people who have problems with their hair falling out. Along with the shampoo and conditioning spray, it will help regrow the hair you lost.</li>
    <li> I use this conditioner as part of the Nioxin 3 part system for my fine, thinning hair. It is not very moisturizing, so what I do is rub it into my scalp and the first inch or so of my hair, then use a very moisturizing conditioner on my ends and working up to the rest of my hair (my hair falls right by my shoulders). I find Joico KPak conditioners to be good for everyday, and Aussie 3 minute miracle or even heavier hair masks once or twice a week.

    <li> It really works. Shipped on tiime.</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair look thicker without drying it out.  My hair feels soft and looks healthy.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since October or November and have seen a noticeable difference in the thickness of my hair. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I think the product is great. Have been using it for several years now. Decreases my hair loss during dieting</li>
    <li> Great conditioner.  I typically have dry thin hair (without this product) and my hair feels fuller and is definitely softer after using it.</li>
    <li> My hair came back very thin in spots, after having chemotherapy.  My hair was always fine, but never thin.  After using Nioxin for a few months, I can definitely see a difference.  It&#x27;s not drastic, but it&#x27;s definitely beginning to come in thicker.</li>
