      <li>Based on the reviews I&#x27;ve read, I have no doubt this lotion works for some, but if you are prone to heat rashes, or your skin is easily over stimulated, stay away from it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have really dry skin especially on my feet but when I use this exfoliating body lotion my skin feels silky smooth all over. This is now one of my must-have beauty products.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great. I use it on my must trouble areas which are my elbows and knees. It leaves my skin soft and the moisture last throughout the day. I was also having some mild acne problems on my back, it got rid of the small bumps and redness.</li>
    <li> You have got to try this if you are serious about your skin!!!</li>
    <li> I had many dead skin cells,Even my elbows where a bit on the dark side,However i am very glad i was introduced to this it has made my skin clearer and i no longer need to worry about ashy elbows!</li>
    <li> Seriously?! Tons of great reviews all posted on the same days (i.e. April 7th) - and NOT ONE, in all of the current reviews, is a &amp;#34;Verified Purchase&amp;#34; !!  That seems a bit extreme!</li>
    <li> LOVE. IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this body lotion for a month now and here is what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; My back acne is practically gone.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; My skin is soft - even though I live in an extremely dry climate.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; I had a sun burn and was suffering from a bad case of &amp;#34;flaky skin&amp;#34; but this lotion fixed it!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; My heels are also soft - and ready for flip flops!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; My sensitive skin tolerated this body lotion VERY SMOOTHLY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product and am actually planning to buy it again soon.</li>
    <li> I use this cleanser along with the exfoliant and it is the best combo Ive ever used for skin care! Don&#x27;t buy one without the other, you certainly won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Took my dry snake legs and made them so so soft!</li>
    <li> The items in this product will help to keep your skin smooth. I also am happy to know that if I ever got calluses I could get them removed. The items seem to work quickly and have great results. I will be happy to refer these items to other people.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a scam. Tons of poorly-written 5-star reviews and only ONE verified purchase among them.</li>
    <li> I have been using Beauty Facial Extreme Exfoliating Lotion for my dry skin. I like that it helps my dry skin while also exfoliating. It works well with my loofah sponge and has become a daily ritual. I love that it also helps treat the red bumps that can be caused by mild acne. It absorbs quickly in the skin, so there is no oily residue left over.</li>
    <li> My skin feels so hydrated.</li>
    <li> My skin recently started becoming bumpy, itchy and red, and I bought this lotion hoping it would help with what I presumed to be plugged oil glands. I still don&#x27;t know what ails me, but after using this lotion once, my skin first felt like it was on fire and then it turned red, starting itching and I broke out in hives. I had to wash the lotion off, apply camomile and then put ice packs on my skin. Based on the reviews I&#x27;ve read, I have no doubt this lotion works for some, but if you are prone to heat rashes, or your skin is easily over stimulated, stay away from it. Oh, and the smell is horrible. Very, very dissapointed.</li>
    <li> MostiruiZed my skin without the oily feeling ! And smells amazing ! Great especially after the shower ! And great for sensitive skin !</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It makes my skin feel smooth and smells great. I have little bumps on my legs and this helps get rid of them!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> Talk about a quick solution! I had dry skin for years and nothing has worked. After not even a week I feel like I&#x27;ve never even had dry skin. It instantly soothed me. What a relief!</li>
    <li> Not so goos as other people have rated this product... The redness from the kp got worse after I started using this product.</li>
    <li> This is so great. I&#x27;ve been looking for something to use for my legs. They are always dry like it&#x27;s winter 24/7. This really helped.</li>
    <li> If you have dry and scaly skin like me then this product is going to work wonders for you. I tried it out for a week and I can see my skin improving a lot. It definitely has become smoother than it used to be and I can see less dry skin already. I’m very impressed by not just the results but also how fast it works.</li>
    <li> This lotion is a one-of-a-kind! Feeling more confident than ever in my own skin!</li>
    <li> I wanted a lotion that would help reduce my flaky skin. I have tried many products with very poor results. This body lotion has reduced my flaky skin and my confidence has gone back to the way it used to be.</li>
    <li> This lotion is wonderful. It leaves my skin smooth and luxuriously hydrated. My skin used to be so dry and cracked but this lotion removes the dead skin and leaves my skin soft and so hydrated. I love this brand and would recommend !</li>
    <li> This left my skin very smooth and not greasy like some products I have experienced in the past.</li>
    <li> This lotion is really wonderful very smooth, it leaves my skin smooth and luxuriously hydrated enough. This has a great moisturizing effect on my skin while simultaneously removing any dead skin that may be on the surface that may be dulling my shine or glow. This is really awesome. It does burn a bit when you apply it on your skin but within seconds. This cream has been great for my skin, its results are amazing, my skin is exfoliated and bright, looks healthy and smooth, my skin is more gentle and is healthy, just what I needed, perfect for every day, in my work I get plenty of sunlight, and the lack of vitamins for the skin made had this turn ugly , dirty, it wasn&#x27;t all healthy, but it has now been a turn of 360 °, this much more healthy before, I love this product, do not is that I would do without him, the shipping was fast, excellent product, I love it! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this heavy duty lotion. It does it&#x27;s job well and the results are so obvious. My skin is so terribly dry and damaged and this is the lotion that can fix it up in no time.</li>
    <li> love this product.  love it for my dry skin areas, my feet, elbows and knees. also i love the bottle artwork, very retro.  also i have used it on my husband and he love it too.</li>
    <li> The winter months was harsh to my skin! It was constantly dry and peeling! So glad I found this moisturize. It&#x27;s non greasy and just what I needed.</li>
    <li> My face looks and feels clean! This is a miracle product.</li>
    <li> Fantastic body lotion. It gives good relief to the dry and hard skin specially around knees and elbows. Now, I don&#x27;t hesitate wearing half Tee-shirts while going out. Thanks to this product.:)</li>
    <li> This is an effective cleanser and lotion all in one.  It will gently clean the skin and help eliminate dry flaky skin.</li>
    <li> My skin is usually dry and this product has worked wonders to make it smooth. I feel more confident now when I go out.</li>
    <li> This product gives the best treatment to a dry skin and will be most useful to people with cracking dehydrated skin.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t listen to all the negative comments. This lotion ranks high on the list in my opinion as one of the best. My skin feels smoother and I itch a lot less. It keeps my skin feeling moist, comfortable, and it smells amazing. And it&#x27;s really affordable unlike a lot of brand name things.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry that I did not find this product good even the first time using it.  It definitely stings going on, and afterwards, my 9 year old daughter &amp; I found our skin very itchy and uncomfortable. (We even had to wash it off of my daughter&#x27;s arms and legs because it felt so bad).  I don&#x27;t think it is good for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I was a little surprised at how small the bottle was. Considering what I paid, I was hoping this lotion wouldn&#x27;t work because I don&#x27;t want to have to spend this much on a regular basis. Unfortunately, it does work better than anything I&#x27;ve used before. Sucks.</li>
    <li> I have a dry skin especially during winter full dry, itchy and flaky. After started with this lotion, it goes on so smooth and soft and also its not greasy. This body lotion is effective especially in winter for me. I liked it and would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I have suffered with EXTREMELY dry skin for years.  Tried everything, oils (different kinds), lotions, shea butter, etc.  Nothing worked.  This lotion worked like a miracle.  After the 1st time, my dry skin was significantly better, and after 3X my lizard skin was gone.  It does sting a little, but not for long.  I also tried other 12% lactic acid body lotions to see which one works best, and this is it.  For me and my extremely dry skin, this is worth the investment.</li>
    <li> A great skin product that helps dry skin and skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure at first if it would work and given the price winced when I bought it, but after taking the chance, I have to say I&#x27;m glad I did, it works, the dry skin from my keratosis pilaris is much improved, definitely a win!!!!! rrc</li>
    <li> You get exactly what you pay for with this lotion. I have a dry skin that’s often flaky and I’ve been on the lookout for a product like this. It smells, feels and works great. My skin is always so soft after using it. I love and recommend this body lotion.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Felt my skin soften after a few uses and the smell isn&#x27;t too overpowering.</li>
    <li> My skin feels so much smoother after using this lotion....I really recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great product for the money.  Smells great and works wonderful.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> leaves me feeling silky and moist</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion. It goes on sooo smooth and is not greasy at all. My skin is super sensitive so most lotions irritate my skin, this does not at all. My skin is soft, smooth, and has a healthy glow to it. I am very impressed and would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I was suffering from dry skin and acne, so I bought this together with the anti-acne version of it and I have to say that this one works like a charm too. It really helped me getting rid of my dry skin by just using it on a daily basis. Definitly recommend this one if you want to get rid of dry skin.</li>
    <li> My skin seems softer after only a couple of days. I also use a body scrub to help it out for more results.</li>
    <li> I have experienced dead skin cells especially on the surface of my legs for a long time. I tried using so many products which have failed. I recently discovered beauty facial extreme’s exfoliating body lotion. I use it in addition to the body scrub and the result is wonderful. It has helped remove years of accumulated and build up dead cells  in the skin.</li>
    <li> Yep! I bought it and I love it!</li>
    <li> I use this with the scrub and my skin is totally happy! Smooth and radiant!</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders I absolutely love it, it moisturized my skin beautifully and after just a few uses I can see and feel a huge difference!</li>
    <li> Gosh, I&#x27;m beyond happy that I got this lotion! I have extremely picky skin, and it&#x27;s almost impossible to balance the problems I have! I always seem to either start breaking out, or have extremely dry skin. I heard this lotion wasn&#x27;t greesy so I decided to give it a chance and I am so happy I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since having this product I have not broken out, nor had dry skin! My skin has also become very smooth and some wrinkles/scars I had have faded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a new lotion, and have skin like mine, then this is the lotion for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Price is great!&lt;br /&gt;-Works great!&lt;br /&gt;-No Acne!&lt;br /&gt;-Not Greesy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Sometimes it&#x27;s tough to get lotion out of the bottle, I&#x27;m not sure why!&lt;br /&gt;-The scent is awkward, but not bad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very happy with the product! It&#x27;s really helped me with my self confidence, and making sure my skin looks good!</li>
    <li> Really good skin care product, keeps my skin healthy and cleans all my impurities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for two days and this is my very first Amazon review. Chicken skin is 200% better in just two days and I can&#x27;t believe how smooth my skin is now. I hate lotions usually but I&#x27;m affixed to this one now. Amazing.</li>
    <li> Got rid of my chronic dry, flaky skin within 2 weeks of using it!  Good riddance alligator skin!</li>
    <li> I enjoy the results of having fresh skin.  I also use this on my elbows because I spend long hours at a desk which causes the blood supply to be restricted and they turn grey and very rough.</li>
    <li> My skin feels so smooth!</li>
    <li> Awesome !! It does burn a bit when you apply it on your skin but within seconds.. it leaves your skin smooth radiant and polished... I m using it for my back and elbows which were suffering from breakouts and they are vanished...</li>
    <li> Using this along with the body and facial wash has drastically changed my skin and self confidence. My eczema has receded and I no longer have to deal with dry, flakey skin. It also smells excellent!</li>
    <li> Dry skin used to be the bane of my existence, now I can go out without people asking if its Ash Wednesday.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this. I had to try it one day because my hands were really rough. Now, I think she likes ME using it as much as she likes it for herself. haha</li>
    <li> I use this lotion every morning to keep my skin moist and healthy throughout the day. It&#x27;s never greasy or messy, and it really revives my skin&#x27;s natural complexion. It&#x27;s also great for skin conditions like eczema or psoriasis.</li>
    <li> I was suffering with chicken skin (keratosis pilaris) on upper arms. After I started the use of exfoliating body lotion I can see my skin is getting better and better day by day. I can feel soft and clean skin now.</li>
