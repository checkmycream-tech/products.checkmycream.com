      <li>This soap right here is it.</li>

      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been able to keep it in check with this cleansing bar, then I follow up by massaging a little baking soda as an exfoliant on the area.  </li>
      <li>this product is so good that my husband&#x27;s acne was cleared in just a few days of using it!!!</li>
      <li>If you have normal non-sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve experimented with a BUNCH of different products, but this one seems to be the right combination of effective-yet-gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 68 years old and this product has kept my skin soft, clear and even toned.</li>
      <li>then I&#x27;d say give this bar a try, but if you&#x27;re like me and have sensitive skin then stay clear of this product unless you want a rash.</li>
      <li>Apparently Aveeno has discontinued</li>

<li> My husband uses this soap twice a day everyday.  </li>
<li> and I&#x27;m prone to small breakouts, as well as &amp;#34;heat bumps&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;stress bumps&amp;#34; under the skin on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Only downside is it&#x27;s extremely expensive.</li>
<li> They sell at walmart however extremely hard to get a hold of.</li>
<li> but now it breaks me out terribly and dries my skin.</li>

    <li> I have sensitive skin , I cant use anything too wild or with too much fragrance, but this soap really cleans well , doesnt leave my face dry and has a really nice light scent to it. You cant beat the price! and for the price its atleast worth a try. Out of all the products I have used on my face this has to be the best.</li>

    <li> I think Aveeno has stopped making this soap.  Boo!  I was so happy to find these - definitely more expensive than what I am used to paying, but worth it just to have it!  My husband uses this soap twice a day everyday.  Needed the multiple pack.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it says - it keeps your complexion clear!  I love it!</li>
    <li> Great product if you experience acne.  Best buy for a bar that should last at least 2 months of daily use.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years. I get contact dermatitis from dust and pollen and this product somehow relives my breakout I get from this problem. I&#x27;m 68 years old and this product has kept my skin soft, clear and even toned. Got upset with the company that makes this product as once they came out with the higher priced liquid wash of it you could not find the bar one in any stores in my home town. For now our Walmart Store is carrying the bar again. Otherwise have purchased it here on Amazon.com in multi-package.</li>
