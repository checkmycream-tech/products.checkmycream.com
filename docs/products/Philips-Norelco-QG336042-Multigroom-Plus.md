<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it.. Best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.. cut great, no pulling and super fast</li>
    <li> grandson loves this, good price  - works well</li>
    <li> works fine, dint really meet my expectations though. was expecting more blade heads. But has good battery which runs upto 30min in turbo</li>
    <li> Works really well. The attachments are nice. The foil shaver is junk, so I still use my old razor for smooth areas, but the guards and edge trimmers are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it isn&#x27;t mentioned, but this one comes with a plastic tray for all the parts. The difference between this model and the step up model is the &amp;#34;Deluxe stand.&amp;#34; The stand included with this one is perfectly acceptable.</li>
    <li> Let me first preface this review in that I bought the Philips Norelcom Multigroom for a use that is not technically supported - trimming body hair.  I do see that that the next model up (QG3380), does have a Body Hair comb but if the combs (or guards, as I call them) are that fragile, it would be a bust, as well.  Plus it&#x27;s $30 more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have lots of chest and back hair.  I know, sucks to be my, right?  RIIIIGHT?  Well it does.  At any rate, about three times a year, I use a little Remington groomer, with a guard in place, at the lowest setting and do my chest and arms and my lovely wife or some other family \\&quot;victim\\&quot; does my back.  The Remington would do it&#x27;s job but it is so small and the batteries have died an early death, so I decided to upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Norelco QG3360 Multigroom plus, does look capable.  It has a strong motor, fast charging times and it&#x27;s water rinseable - so it seemed like a hit.  Until I attempted to install a guard.  The little Remington has grippers on the side and two little nubs that lock the comb/ guard in place.  Not so on the Philips Nprelco.  The only reason that I knew that the guard was going on was that the length adjustment slider matched up with the length guage.  The combs do not go on easy.  They do not lock.  AND when you finally get it in place (thanfully not breaking the flexing plastic piece), you wonder how it will come back off, without breaking.  The instructions were totally worthless.  Now, I COULD trim the chest and back hair, just with the trimmer but I&#x27;ve done that before and got the scars.  Imagine a pulsating metal rake, scraping across your body.  Waxing sounds like an option, eh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, at least for me, the hard to install guards are a TOTAL fail - regardless if I was using as intended or not.  She&#x27;s going back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;Powerful&lt;br /&gt;Fast Charging&lt;br /&gt;Can use corded or cordless&lt;br /&gt;Nice Storage Pouch&lt;br /&gt;Water Rinseable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Combs/Guards impossible to install&lt;br /&gt;Combs / guards too fragile&lt;br /&gt;Poor Instructionse to install&lt;br /&gt;Combs / guards too fragile&lt;br /&gt;Poor Instructions</li>
    <li> if your a perfectionist... you will love it... EACH clipper attachment has 20 increment positions to tweak it... charged FAST... only reason i gave 4 stars is it doesn&#x27;t come with a counter top stand... does have a nice bag to keep parts in or travel... very nice for a analytic person like me</li>
    <li> I gave this four stars based on the clip on trimmer guides. They seem a little flimsy but so far so good. The trimmer itself seems very well made and is nicer than the previous Norelco one I owned which died after ten years. The &amp;#34;storage tray&amp;#34; is a joke I would describe it as packing. Since I only utilize two of the attachments I leave the rest in the tray in a drawer and don&#x27;t care. If you are going to use all of these cutters you&#x27;ll need to find a better way to organize them.</li>
    <li> It is an OK device for trimming. Although you need to try a few times before you get your hand set on this tool. However I don&#x27;t have such a long beard and for me it didn&#x27;t work in terms of trimming. The mini foil shaver did work but it&#x27;s not meant for shaving. I got that confused for shaver and that&#x27;s why I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;This is not a substitute for Hair trimmer. It works but not as good as it is advertised. Probably because of the lack of other proper locks that are more accurate.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it was an OK device for me. Moreover it isn&#x27;t meant for a close shave, so returned it.</li>
    <li> I gave it to my son as a gift and he says he enjoys it. I&#x27;m sure that if he had any complaints I would have heard them, so this product was a great buy for us.</li>
    <li> A great little trimmer. I have used it 3 times now and I am very pleased with it. It has a wide range if adjustments and cuts very well.</li>
    <li> My husband just started using this product and it meets expectations. It has many different feature that he has not yet tested.</li>
    <li> Great product, just what I needed for an excelent beard grooming. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> One of the best purchases i made. Son uses it daily!</li>
    <li> best one I have had yet</li>
    <li> Trimmer works great for beard and other facial hair.  Also works good for shaving trimming in other areas as well.</li>
    <li> I use this to quick trim my beard and my head when I&#x27;m too lazy to shave with a real razor or my Panasonic LA63 (fantastic shaver btw). Wish the battery would last a little longer, but it charges very quickly and it can be used plugged in which is a nice bonus when you&#x27;ve forgotten to charge or you run out mid shave.</li>
    <li> Had no problems so far, good battery life and does what it&#x27;s supposed to. Nice assortment of attachments.</li>
    <li> the battery lasted one month</li>
    <li> Works well, great for travel.</li>
    <li> Item broke after minimal use for 4 months, by minimal I mean about once every 1-2 weeks or so. I tried contacting the seller, but they have not responded.</li>
    <li> My old clippers had a terrible battery that only lasted approx. 10 minutes.  If I was doing a lot of manscaping, my old one would die 3/4 of the way through.  This one, though, is awesome.  It comes with more attachments than I&#x27;ll ever need and the battery actually lasts.  I used it once for about 20 minutes and it didn&#x27;t even come close to dying.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s improved from previous model, except for the angle of the edge trimmer and mini shaver heads. The angle is much lower than the previous model, making it difficult to see where exactly you&#x27;re cutting.</li>
    <li> Just a really great razor.  The battery works as well as they claim.  Can&#x27;t speak to its durability, but I&#x27;ve been very pleased so far</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all. When tried to plug it in for the first time, the charging light never came on. I left it plugged in for a while to see if it would work, but it never came on and wouldn&#x27;t turn on. Unfortunately threw away the packaging so I can&#x27;t return it, but don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this specifically to clip my hair and replace the Whal that had a dying battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guards on this are TERRIBLE.  they are not solid, meaning that they flex when running it on your head.  If you look at the picture of the guards, you will see that the leading edge of them are not connected to the sides.  You can actually feel them move and flex when in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the only use of this is for cleaning up sideburns.  An expensive tool for that.</li>
    <li> I gifted my husband with this and he is very happy with it. It&#x27;s his second one in 5 years from this maker. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Not easy to switch the shaving tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cut the hair very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty fast charging. I am not sure if it is full.</li>
    <li> Best one I have purchased for him so far.  It does everything it says it will.  He says it is great!</li>
    <li> Works great, feels good in your hand. The tray that it comes with is kind of skimpy but it doesn&#x27;t need to be sturdy. My issue with the tray is the foot print. It takes up a lot of space on the counter. I did see this unit a few bucks cheaper at Sam&#x27;s Club. I would buy it again though.</li>
    <li> These clippers are quiet, hold a charge for a long time, and operate smoothly without any pinching or nicking. I bought these as a replacement for my old Wahl Groomsman that died after many years of service. After reading the current Wahl reviews I decided to try this competing product; I am glad I did!</li>
    <li> Works really well! Perfect length for stubble and the multiple heads give it a wide range of uses. Definitely worth the money</li>
    <li> I give this product 2.5 Stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to own a Remington HC-600 for a few years.  I continued to use it after I relocated overseas with a 220v transformer.  One day I forgot to use the transformer so the charger broke, very stupid on my part.  I looked for a charger and it costs $10 on the remington site.  So I figured what the heck, for that price I&#x27;ll buy a new one.  Since it&#x27;s been years, maybe technology progressed and it would be easier to buy a device that supports dual voltage 110-220v, for me at least.  Throw in an Amazon clip coupon for $5 off too to seal the deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comparison, I was disappointed:&lt;br /&gt;-The Norelco is not even close to the solid build of the Remington&lt;br /&gt;-Norelco lacks the power, even in \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; mode.&lt;br /&gt;-You need to clean out the hairs on the Norelco after a few runs.&lt;br /&gt;-The Norelco is almost half the with, but maybe more efficient for travel purposes.&lt;br /&gt;-On the Norelco, hairs get stuck inside the trimmer attachment head and device. (so after every use, make sure to twist out whatever attachment you are using and clean out hairs)&lt;br /&gt;-This Norelco I believe is water resistant but you need the next model up to use inside the shower (No problem with the Remington, can be used inside the shower and very nice water tight seal)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I miss my Remington very much.  I was able to use it for everything - trimming hair on head and other body parts, trimming sideburns and facial hair.  Best of all, it was very strong, hair never got caught in it, and it would do the job in a single pass.  Only thing missing it the nose hair attachment included in the Norelco.  But I used it once (for the first time in my life) and didn&#x27;t like it -- The hairs felt sharper inside my nose, especially when having to blow your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t work for either company and this is my personal opinion.  I read tons of reviews here and rarely post, but I wanted to help out others going through a similar decision I had to make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.</li>
    <li> the range of attachments and adjustability is awesome, much finer range than anything else i have owned. small charger, quick charge time (i leave it plugged in when not in use) and feels well built.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sounds a little slower than my last trimmer, and while i knew it didn&#x27;t have a vacuum i&#x27;m amazed at how much more of a mess it makes compared to my old Norelco with a vacuum. Turbo button is mostly useless, it should spin at that speed all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;worth the money for sure.</li>
    <li> my husband likes this one and he ordered one more for his father since it is easy to use :)</li>
    <li> The guards stay in place which is UBER important! Have use it about 3 times over 3 weeks and it is still running off the first charge. Easy to clean. The storage bag that it comes with is of little value. I put the whole kit in an old diaper bag we had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is taking me some experimenting to find the attachments that I will use. Out of the several that come with the unit, it seems I will only use one or two.</li>
    <li> I like everything about this , except for the way the attachments are attached. Isn&#x27;t very easy to slide them do different settings, like the older model, but has great power and gets the job done!</li>
    <li> The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is the bag it ships with is just useless....they really need to supply a small case where every part has a place, easy to get to and things don&#x27;t keep falling out.</li>
    <li> Replaced my old Norelco and does a very good job</li>
    <li> On time.  As expected.  Would recommend.  Would order again.</li>
    <li> This philips norelco electric shaver is AMAZING! It comes with 8 additional attachments, the shaver, carrying bag and a charger. Its great for when you&#x27;re low on time and/or traveling!</li>
    <li> This won&#x27;t last long but in the meantime it will do a pretty good job of trimming your beard/hair.</li>
    <li> The beard guard on this face trimmer is horrible. It butchered my husband&#x27;s beautiful beard.</li>
    <li> This multigroom unit works great! Holds a good charge, has good power (I have a thick beard) It is safe to use, the guards are good, the attachments are good and the cleaning is great too. The fact that its a wet/dry groomer is awesome also! $30 is reasonable also I think. Good buy for me.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.</li>
    <li> The design is one of the most uncomfortable design , both in terms of hold and angle / direction of the blades.&lt;br /&gt;While the large clipper , turns in one direction, the small clipper has a different direction.  Since the blades are almost very close to the body, you have to really angle it , at an extremely uncomfortable angle, for a self trim , especially if you are reaching to back of neck or back or side of necks. The only good thing is that the motor is very powerfull and holds charge fast and long.&lt;br /&gt;The bad , is that the grip is slippery, and can easily fall down , given you have to hold at crazy angles.&lt;br /&gt;Great is many aspects, falls short on user comfort and ease of use and grip.. Two stars.</li>
    <li> The guard sizes are smaller than i was use to so be careful and start with a higher guard and work your way down.</li>
    <li> Exactly what my husband wanted.  Smooth shave, he was able to eliminate his nose trimmer because there is one in this item.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a trimmer for a while and finally went with this. It works great for getting a close trim for the mustache and beard.</li>
    <li> This thing only lasted one day.  It stopped working after just one use.  It stopped being able to spin all the additions.  Junk and cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because it had a good amount of reviews so I figured it would at least be decent but nope, I was wrong.</li>
    <li> After only having this for about a month the battery seems to be non functional, wont hold a charge at all.  I have left it on the charger for over 24 hours and it will only run for about 3 minutes before it stops and charge is lost.</li>
    <li> Unit arrived in a plastic bag that said &amp;#34;Ready to ship&amp;#34; and appeared to have been previously opened.  When plugged in DID NOT WORK.  WATCH OUT FOR REPACKAGED ITEMS THAT HAVE BEEN RETURNED!!</li>
    <li> It has everything i need. Figured I&#x27;d spend a little extra for the upgraded version but it doesn&#x27;t feel any different than a low end priced similiar models. Same plastic casing, same interchangeable parts. Theres nothing on the market with these types of interchangeable parts ( I was looking specifically for the nose trimmer part) that is any better than the $15-$20 priced trimmers. That I have been through. So all in all. I&#x27;m content with this, it works well, has the parts I wanted and will hopefully last longer than 2-3 years.</li>
    <li> This is a nice clipper set for some &amp;#34;grooming&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this to replace an old set of clippers that we&#x27;re starting to hurt more than help. The metal clipper head is a nice upgrade to a standard set of clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adapters cover just about any kind of &amp;#34;grooming&amp;#34; you&#x27;d want to do. I do wish it had a better case or storage for the adapters and it only comes with a bag that makes it a little more challenging to find what you are looking for quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quick charge feature is a nice feature to allow you to get going if you find it&#x27;s dead. I&#x27;ve also found it very easy to keep clean with the included brush and a quick rinse in the sink.</li>
    <li> Thanks to this trimmer I have done away with having to use scissors, trimmer and razors to maintain my beard. This groomer/trimmer works well as an all-in-one for me, the different heads allow me to easily switch between edging and general length maintenance. Still occasionally pulls, but considering that my hair grows in all directions that is still impressive, especial given the very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little too early to tell, but I suspect the trimming guides won&#x27;t last, as they seem a little flimsy.  Nonetheless, it&#x27;s functioned even better than what I expected for the price, it&#x27;s simple to use and clean, and it holds a charge forever.  Very handy.</li>
    <li> it hurts when u use it. it takes to much time to remove the hair off the face. it dosent properly removes the hair.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, highly suggested..... it takes me less than 25 minutes cutting my hair &amp; work on the beard.... excellent!</li>
    <li> Like the clippers however, they are not cut proof like they claim - ie right up against your skin will not cut you, well, it depends on the area of skin. Normal areas like face, chest, arm pitts, ect... it does great - no teeth snagging skin, BUT, in the nether regions, ouch!!! The old tool bag took a few pretty big cuts, put on the guard and yowsie, another snag! Both tried while stretching skin smooth. Guys, this one will not do for that type of trimming.</li>
    <li> All the attachments on this product are garbage. They look, feel, and are flimsy. The only attachment on this that is decent is the one seen in this picture the one with the metal head. The trimmer itself is good but it does not do any fine trimming as in lining your beard. Other then that it seems to be an ok product.</li>
    <li> trims my beard. it works properly and charges quickly. where other multigrooms fell short this one well exceeds all expectations.</li>
    <li> This was a good value purchase. I don&#x27;t think it seems cheap at all, it actually seems well made, but I&#x27;m no expert.  My husband uses this once a week, he uses 2 of the heads, for different lengths.  He&#x27;s able to trim/groom his whole, hairy face in 5 minutes or less.  I&#x27;m so glad we got this.  His last one was old, rusty and he didn&#x27;t want to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a quality product and should last a few years!</li>
    <li> Have owned four trimmers since the beginning of the summer of 2013, including this one. Two Remingtons, one Braun, and now this guy. The Remingtons both died on me within a couple of weeks, and so did the Braun. After two months of using this thing, I am still happy with the purchase. It has not experienced the many, many problems I encountered with the aforementioned brands, and the tools it comes with are useful and diverse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR: Don&#x27;t go with Remington or Braun. Go with Phillips Norelco.</li>
    <li> Was a christmas present. Boyfriend said it did more than he expected, gives a comfortable shave and is one he&#x27;d recommend.</li>
    <li> Guards don&#x27;t actually prevent access to the blade, and are flimsy and flexible. So if the guard catches your skin (which it does, because it has little sharp points), then the natural rotation as you continue to move takes a big chunk out because the unguarded blade isn&#x27;t prevented from coming very close to your skin..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to press the guard against my skin to achieve a consistent length trim failed. The flimsy guard just bent inward and again I took a big unintended chunk out, ruining my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ended up having to take the whole beard off. Pretty unhappy about that.</li>
    <li> I really like this groomer, it has several useful attachments that trim and don&#x27;t dig into the skin. It is easy to use and the attachments are easy to change.&lt;br /&gt;A really good system!</li>
    <li> Great product and is exactly what I was looking for, came on time and as described. It&#x27;s nice and compact.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift and works well.</li>
    <li> Gives a nice trim and is nice and gentle on your skin.  Has a lot of setting choices, which makes it a great all around trimmer.</li>
    <li> This is what I was hoping to locate after visiting three other major outlets. This unit comes with a full range of accessories!&lt;br /&gt;The price was very good! This product does a wonderful job! The instructions were exact and exceptionally helpful!&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is very good -- and the unit is accompanied with a charger! The product is compact and fits comfortably in my hand!&lt;br /&gt;I have used my previous Philips Norelco trimmer for more than ten years and found this new unit to be even more versatile; I am very pleased and completely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love it . very reliable and convienent. comes woth a lot of heads and it is very smooth. very easy to use</li>
    <li> This is probably the worst designed shaver from Norelco. I owned one which was on its last leg - but I loved it. So I thought I would go looking at the same brand. This one pinches the crap out of you. The beard trimmer connector is way too far from the blades themselves, so if you&#x27;re not at the right angle, you&#x27;ll skip the set length and dig right in. Also, who the hell thought it would be a good idea for a press-button power to be on the thumb-handling section of the handle? You have the hold the damn thing from the sides to not accidentally press the &#x27;turbo&#x27; button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horrid design - find something better; don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice product, with several options for grooming. Easy to use, water resistent, very very nice product!&lt;br /&gt;Very Satisfied!</li>
    <li> The guard does not actually protect you, and have to be careful when shaving. Have to be careful using this.</li>
    <li> Barley cuts.. I think i got ripped off for the price.</li>
    <li> seems like a good product so far. Combs are a little brittle but is used with care wont break. I think I made a good choice buying it.</li>
    <li> it works excellent and does everything i need it to the trimmer and the nose hair remover is good but not perfect but its cheap and does a good job for the price</li>
    <li> I seen ad on line and I really like the shaver it does a fantastic job and I would recomend it to any of my friends that trims their own beards or cut their own hair like I do it is great.</li>
    <li> BOUGHT THIS FOR MY HUSBAND FOR CHRISTMAS. HE SAW IT ADVERTISED AND WANTED TO TRY IT. SO FAR HE IS VERY PLEASED WITH IT</li>
    <li> So far as good as I expected, I´m very hairy and challenging and this little thing deals with me with total confidence.</li>
    <li> NOT BAD FOR PRICE BUT MICRO FOIL ATTACHMENT LACKS FOR SHAVING THE SMALL AREAS, BUT OTHER THAN THAT I WOULD RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT TO FRIENDS</li>
    <li> I have been toiling away at the $150 &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; razors before deciding to take a flier on this guy. I absolutely love it. My beard is pretty coarse and I was shocked when my full beard just melted off like butter on one stroke. I can&#x27;t recommend this enough.</li>
    <li> It is a fancy shaver but has only the looks. The battery stops holding charge after first 2 months and now I have to plug it directly in the power socket top operate.&lt;br /&gt;Once plugged in, the shaver works fine. If it weren&#x27;t for the battery, i would have rated it near a 5 star product.</li>
    <li> This thing does the job and it comes with a sweet bag. I&#x27;m not quite sure what the turbo setting does for the device. But overall, high marks.</li>
    <li> Excellent accessory for trimming a beard. I only have to trim once every few weeks and am loving not having to shave daily! Best battery operated trimmer I&#x27;ve had so far by quite a margin!  Recharging works very well.</li>
    <li> The last rechargeable beard trimmer I had could not be used with the power cord attached..So when the batteries decided to no longer recharge it became useless..This Trimmer allows you to use with or without the power cord attached..An absolute must for me from now on..As for the performance of the trimmer.. Quiet, very sharp, cuts without pulling.. I had some trouble finding the setting I wanted..The height adjustments are a little awkward to figure out but once I got it set it has stayed set. I have not used the  attachments that it comes with yet so I cannot give a review of them.. As a &amp;#34;keep it short&amp;#34; beard trimmer I am very happy with this trimmer..</li>
    <li> This one does its job perfectly. Could do 3 trimming sessions on one charge. It has a solid feel and the combs are of good quality. If you are using it for the first time, make sure to try with higher setting first then reduce the setting (Also mentioned in the manual).</li>
    <li> I have to say this is a great product.  It helps me keep my beard in tip top shape and when I decide to it is very quick and easy to buzz it off so I can focus on a closer shave with my razor.  I haven&#x27;t used it for the hair but it&#x27;s great for my needs and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It is very useful and simple to use battery operated machine which enables man to look after facial hair. Now all heads are great but in general is great tool.</li>
    <li> I use this shaver primarily for trimming my face every couple of days for a long stubble look.  It is a comfortable shave with the metal directly on the face, which is great, but I notice that it does not trim as close as my Braun 360 trimmer did.  I would like it to trim a little closer, so for this I removed 1 star, but all in all this will be my daily trimmer for the foreseeable future.</li>
    <li> I like it ok.  It has a lot of attachments so you need some place to put them...  Trimmer works pretty well and holds a pretty good charge.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after five months. Can&#x27;t return through Amazon. Very frustrated, but was happy with the product before it stopped working.</li>
    <li> This has been a wonderful trimmer/grooming set. I loved it so much so that I bought my father a set just like it. I really only use 3 of the 6ish attachments that they provide you, but the battery life and trimmer quality is great. One thing to note, is that the beard trimmer marking numbers are in units of 1/32&#x27;s. So if you are looking to trim something to a #3 (which is typically 3/8&amp;#34; tall) then you will need to use the size 12 on the beard trimmer (4 x #3 &#x3D; 12 or 12/32).</li>
    <li> I usually buy a trimmer every year based on the packaging, but this year I went with some positive reviews and a link from SD.  Have only shaved twice with it so far, but it cut through my super thick (lush) beard, which is pretty impressive because it was virtually bulletproof.  Imagine a thousand tiny lumberjacks felling the mighty oaks that are my whiskers and that&#x27;s pretty much what we&#x27;re talking here.  lots of attachments, holds a charge, feels solid, good purchase. Will return to complain if anything comes up!</li>
    <li> use it in the EU, ok power, somewhat small head, not too sharp for very short beards. Vet nice packaging / number of accessories otherwise. Not sure if relatively low power is due to the 220V (machine works officially for 100-220V)</li>
    <li> 3 stars I have yet to use it but am happy with it so far... will review it again once I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added review- Tested it, excellent bread trimmer, better than my current pansonic and it&#x27;s easy to clean. Really happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I like it. good and I can groom easily with it. Can change peaces easily, I do recommend it as I tried other products.</li>
    <li> The price is reasonable offering you a complete set for the grooming. I wish this had a simple rotary shaver too. The battery life is quite good. The nose trimmer is not great but other heads are fine.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer for my beard and I have used it for the past 2 months. It is very nice and trims as it says. It has different accessories to cut hair from head, ears, nose, and beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> I use this exclusively for manscaping and it suits my needs perfectly. There are plenty of trimmer length settings and even a nose hair trimmer; very versatile.</li>
    <li> It is much better than the previous trimmer I had. The accessories are great and it is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> First of all it hurts when u use it. it takes to much time to remove the hair off the face. it doesn&#x27;t properly removes the hair at all....</li>
    <li> So far so good.  It seems to do the job.  Charge is not bad.  I will write back if I run into problems.</li>
    <li> Does the job as advice, great quality and battery life. The only thing is that the foil attachement doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> Without quoting everyone else...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guards are a little flimsy, but are easy to take on and off without breaking. If you&#x27;re breaking them by putting them on, adjusting them or taking them off, you&#x27;re doing it wrong. Common sense should tell you if you feel you&#x27;re pushing too hard, you probably are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the guards are bendable, a light touch is needed for even cutting. I trim a very short beard and if I push too hard, I can get almost down to the skin without meaning to. A little practice is needed, but desired results are obtainable with patience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found the battery to last longer than expected and the quick charge works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razors are one category that lives up to the &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; moniker. The more you spend, the nicer, more reliable, easier it is to use.</li>
    <li> Only thing that could have been better is there was a base or organizer to store the groomer and accessories properly.</li>
    <li> I really like this shaver. It is much better than the previous one I had which was a more expensive product. Can&#x27;t vouch for the longevity yet, but it glides very smoothly across the skin and I do not have to go over the same part of my face more than once. Great price as well, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I primarily this groomer to shave my head. It glides smoothly against my hair. Its the best set of clippers Ive purchased so far, and Ive owned about 5 of them. Would definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> Very well made and works excellent especially for the price!  Would highly recommend to anybody!  Very versatile and easy to use.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this set.  It has every tool he needs for his beard and eye brows.  Works perfectly.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm.  Good power,  clean shave and a good selection of attachments.  Doesn&#x27;t run warm.  Will update Re battery life later.</li>
    <li> So easy to use. Changing the settings for different hair lengths is completed in seconds. Comfortable to hold in hand which makes it easy to use from any angle, even behind the head!</li>
    <li> I have had a beard since 1975 and have tried many different beard trimmers over the years.  I use these primarily for the narrow foil shaver (about 1&amp;#34; wide) to trim around my goatee and below my sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is at least the third generation of Norelco beard trimmers going back to the D-Finer and they have all been great performers.  This Norelco lasted 5 weeks on its first charge and the shaver function shaves without pulling hair.  This current design has changed the method of trimming the length of you facial hair.  First time out I cut a chunk out, but hopefully I&#x27;ll get the hang of it after a few more tries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Remington produces something similar, but it grabs nearby hair and pulls them out by the roof - also the battery on the Remingon is pitiful, barely lasting a week.</li>
    <li> Good: Blades are sharp and precise,plenty of attachments, worldwide voltage&lt;br /&gt;Bad: Length settings only upto 20mm :(  .Need atleast 30mm.</li>
    <li> I have had 5 trimmers and this is the best of the bunch. it&#x27;s easy to handle and performs as advertised.</li>
    <li> Very nice good quality</li>
    <li> This groomer absolutely gets the job done with great precision and minimal charging time. It&#x27;s definitely a keeper for me.</li>
    <li> i like it buying one more. recommended perfect for face triming and body triming also. cordless and corded its a must buy</li>
    <li> Finally, after many years, my old trimmer &amp;#34;pooped out&amp;#34;. I do not like change, but I could not find my old trimmer anywhere. I selected this trimmer and it is working out fine. Now if I could only remember the setting I use every time, I would have down. Close trimmer &amp;#34;Great&amp;#34;. Ear attachment OK. Beard trimmer is adjustable, and I&#x27;ve had better, but it works. Close shaver is too fine for my beard.</li>
    <li> excellent produce. No problems and working fine.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver thing for my boyfriend for Christmas. He&#x27;s been using it happily ever since! I&#x27;ve never heard a complaint. He uses it at least every other day to trim his goatee and shave his mustache short without using an irritating razor. I also use it to clean up his neckline between haircuts. it works great, never pulls his hair out, and rinses clean in the sink. Comes with every attachment you would ever need, and a bag to put them all in.</li>
    <li> I love the actual product, however the one I got would never charge. It got sent back right away. We ended up getting another one and it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Really good and worth for the money spent . Battery is good and it holds good for more than 5 shaves.</li>
    <li> I have had this item less than 6 months. I use it twice a week for a beard trimming. It will not keep a charge. I have charged it and it worked for maybe 5 min. Then the battery dies. This is wasted money if you want this item. Look for a better company and a better item.</li>
    <li> Been using this for months now. Works great and love all the accessories. Compliments my Philips three-head electric razor well. I doubt I&#x27;ll use straight blades again.</li>
    <li> Would get 5 stars if the guards were a little tighter, not as precise as I&#x27;d like them to be, but other than that it&#x27;s pretty basic and worth the price.</li>
    <li> The Unit itself works as it should with the replacement heads providing additional functionality. However the plastic attachments are not very good.  You&#x27;d think the blade will be fully centered in the attachment as you raise and lower it, so as you move the device around your face, you don&#x27;t end up accidentally cutting an area too short because the blade is much closer to the front of the attachment than to the top of it.  I try to keep a short beard (something like a long stubble), and there is no way to trim the length of your short beard with this device. In fact I&#x27;m not sure it will help with longer beards since I find the attachments useless.&lt;br /&gt;So far the unit is still working off its initial charge after four beard trims.  Trimming around the beard is done easily with the three interchangeable heads.  I have found no value for the turbo mode, which seems to increase the noise and speed of cutter head by about 20%. The heads are gentle on the skin.  Generally, I found that this will not be the only device I need. I&#x27;m using my full size corded Wahl device to cut my beard short using the longest setting of the main cutting head, then using the Philips Norelco device to trim around the edges.  Cutting a mustache short is also not the job for this device.</li>
    <li> Even though I use the plastic head pieces that come with the unit, I have cut myself by not angling it properly when trimming.</li>
    <li> Much better made than my last beard trimmer.  I have had it for several months.  It works great.  If you need a multi-groom trimmer.  This one is for you.</li>
    <li> I saw the same item for half the price at Sams club. It was kind of not what I expected for the price .</li>
    <li> My husband purchased this to replace an old Norelco very similiar to this one that he had, that but the proverbial dust.  He and the other one for yearssssss  which is the reason he stayed with the Norelco brand.  He&#x27;s pleased w/ it, priced right.  Almost too many adapters for one person to use but at least it gives everyone the option of something that works for them.</li>
    <li> Truly a great item for all around grooming</li>
    <li> This trimmer is so easy to use. It charges faster and stays charged&lt;br /&gt;longer  than others I have used. It is lightweight and gives a close,&lt;br /&gt;smooth trim.</li>
    <li> Used few times to cut my hair. Now it is in the drawer and I am not sure if I will use it again. It is not precise on the cut and even if it comes with adjustable setting. Too many attachments and none of them are good. I have to say that these devices are not easy to use by yourself and no new solutions have been provided by manufacturers in the effort to make these devises more user friendly.</li>
    <li> awesome trimmer. Works great, good price, and fast shipping. I Love it, I would highly recommend this trimmer to any man who want to have a nice trimmed beard, or gooti.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t give this product a super accurate rating because I&#x27;m not the one using it. I purchased it for my boyfriend and all I know is, despite his distain  for shaving, he has been using it!  So four stars just for being nice enough my man will willingly shave! Ha</li>
    <li> After 3 months and dozen uses, this groomer works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* many grooming options&lt;br /&gt;* long battery light&lt;br /&gt;* lightweight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my previous Phillips G480 trimmer that I have had for 5 years, but the quit making the guards and 2 of them broke, so I had to upgrade.  It was a good upgrade though.  This trimmer has more settings than the last, and it has a turbo mode for trimming my beard under my chin where the hair seems to be more stubborn than the rest.  I also like that the heads are for the most part sealed unlike the last one, so the hair doesn&#x27;t get trapped inside of them.  The one thing that I miss from my old one, and the reason I took one star away is that this one does not have a stand.  The last one I had, came with a vertical stand that you could put the charger cable up through the bottom of, so when you placed the trimmer in the stand it would hook up to the charge.  This one, just comes with a tray, and it is huge so it takes up too much space for me to leave it on the bathroom counter like the last one.  Other than that, this is a perfect upgrade from my last one.</li>
    <li> Liked the lower quality model so much I bought the top end one! I bought the lower model a year ago for trimming my moustach, goatee, and sideburns in between haircuts. Works great for around the ears too by the way. Anyway, I liked it so much that I now use that one for travel and keep this one at home.</li>
    <li> I have used wahl devices for years but the last two have died quickly so decided to make a change in brand.  Result?  Meh.  The device seems well made, but the trimmer head is a bit larger than I would prefer and the combs are huge for the purpose and not very intuitive to use.  The adjustable wahl combs were much more straightforward and quick to adjust when going from mustache to eyebrows, simply clicking the comb forward or back to adjust.  Must be a money saving feature to provide multiple combs made of cheap plastic with sharp tines.  Does anyone with a mustache or beard test these things?  Would not purchase again but am stumped on other options for now and already tossed the dreaded sealed, sharp plastic packaging that must be cut to open.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm on my wire-brush beard. Lots of attachments, does everything I need to look human. Portable and easy to travel with as well. Get the version with the bag for the parts.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to help keep my appearance up with my new beard. It can be tricky but it does a great job.</li>
    <li> I got this expecting to use it to edge up my hairline. It was very disappointing to say the least. I needed to go over the same spot over and over to make my hairline neat and straight. The device is underpowered. The only positive is that it comes with many different attachments and is portable. Maybe it is more useful as a beard trimmer, but NOT for cutting clean edges.</li>
    <li> Hubby says good for going close but using the guards it misses a lot of hairs when trimming</li>
    <li> I am obviously very skilled in finding exactly what I want in products on Amazon! Or I am very lucky....</li>
    <li> This is a flimsy hard to assemble item. Charging light never goes off; so, you don&#x27;t know charging status. Intructions are pathetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This broke after one use - flimsy shaft broke off when changing head!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the other reviewers here must have extremely low expectations and/or not enough money to buy an appliance that will work well and last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money for a better brand!</li>
    <li> Lots of attachments and options.  Battery seems to last through a few trimmings, so I don&#x27;t have to charge it after each use.  It&#x27;s very easy to adjust length, without having to change out attachments.  Just click the attachment up or down.  Or use it without any attachments for a pseudo-shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mainly use it to shave/trim my beard.  And I&#x27;ve used it once to trim my head when my plug-in electric trimmer broke.  No problems thus far!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update March 2014 - Well it worked for 11 months.  Now it&#x27;s junk for the garbage heap.  Won&#x27;t turn on, even when plugged in.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected, Easy to trim and adjust tour beard day by day</li>
    <li> I used it on  regular basis .  Nice one in this price.recomended one item for the buyer who cannot purchase expensive one and want a complete unit</li>
    <li> This is a really good multi-groomer. I have noticed after using for a while that it take numerous passes with the trimmer at length and it doesn&#x27;t always cut evenly. I&#x27;ve got a beard and I keep it at 15mm and it takes a bit to get it all, but it does the job and I do like the turbo feature as well.</li>
    <li> I use this to trim my beard and my hair (I&#x27;m mostly bald, so that makes it easy to trim). It seems to stay charged a long time.</li>
    <li> It is quiet and runs for a long time on a charge.  The multiple heads make it a must have if you have facial hair.  It keeps me well groomed and it is easy to use.</li>
    <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t like a super super close shave because it irritates his face, and his beard doesnt grow that fast anyway.  This is perfect.  Gets close enough to just have slight stubble.  Attachments work well for other trimming.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Using this clipper instead of going to a barber has now saved me over $100.  I have a pretty simple hairstyle, the kind of thing that a barber doesn&#x27;t even bother with scissors on.  So I decided that it would be much more cost effective for me to just clip my own hair and I think it looks great.  The other clipping accessories such as the nose trimmer are great and effective as well.  I can&#x27;t really say anything about the beard clipper since I&#x27;m a clean shaven kind of guy so I don&#x27;t use that attachment.  Great for anyone who prefers to save money and not go to a barber.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for: an all-in-one razor that doesn&#x27;t sacrifice. It has many options to choose from and they all work great, except for the foil razor thing. I&#x27;m not sure what that does as it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything. Or maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong. Very fast charge time and it holds a charge for a good time (it&#x27;s never died on me during use so I don&#x27;t actually know how long it lasts). The blades are sharp and do an excellent job trimming. Great for facial hair, regular hair and manscaping.</li>
    <li> I use this grooming system in lieu shaving daily and I can HIGHLY recommend it.  One attachment is for the beard, one for nose and ear hair and another for eyebrows and mustache.  About half the time of a full shave and none of the mess....you can&#x27;t beat that!!</li>
    <li> best hair trimmer ever.&lt;br /&gt;charges in one hour, has 5min quick charge and can be rinsed with water...</li>
    <li> I replaced my piece of junk wahl rechargeable with this one.  It works great.  Strong motor, good battery life and works while plugged in too if you don&#x27;t have time to charge it.  Comes with a lot of accessories.</li>
    <li> Used it in total 20 times the nose piece to clean nose and 5-6 times to trim my body hair over 2 years and the battery is dead now it doesn&#x27;t hold the charge, so disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t work when it is corded. Even if you plug it in it would still need to have the battery charged to work, so if the battery is dead it won&#x27;t work at all. That&#x27;s so bad because all the other parts are working and the shaver is doing great job. They should fire whoever designed the power source of this shaver, or maybe they do it on purpose for $$$$ to make you waste your money and buy another one.  Edit, I contacted their customer service and they replaced the unit including the return shipping which was very nice.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Has a variety of options for trimming / shaving your beard / mustache.&lt;br /&gt;The set of combs with a variety of length settings makes is easy for trimming ans also to trim / shave according to the scenario.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a Christmas gift.  The recipient was very pleased with it.  It could trim the beard as described as well as trim hair to shorten it around the ears.  He was very happy with it.  The cutting blades worked very well as there was no pulling and the different adjustments made it easy to cut to the desired length.  This could be used with the hardwire connection which could be a concern for some, if  you want to use it right away without wireless charging.</li>
    <li> I bought for my husband, he loves it, it has all the great attachments. That was a great Christmas present. I always like Phillips products. Good to know they still make great things.  order came on time, I think it has good price.  Strongly recommend to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Order came on time, nothing damage, I do like very much shopping on Amazon site, they are truly perfect to deal with and mostly the time they great price for everything.&lt;br /&gt;Chris</li>
    <li> Nice ! easy to use for first time users.&lt;br /&gt;Nice to have for personal usage.&lt;br /&gt;Like Quick recharging feature for this device.</li>
    <li> Anyone reading a review of the Multigroom Plus should keep in mind that there are great variations in the beards and facial shapes of men. I&#x27;m assuming that this product may work well for some men. My beard is a bit sparse on the sides of my face and quite thick at the mustache and goatee. I wanted a product that would give me a very trimmed looked---a short but even length without looking ragged or shaggy. I simply cannot get an evenly trimmed look with this product. While I&#x27;m shaving my chin, it cuts too closely in places and not enough in others. The combs catch and pull no matter where I am shaving. Practice does not make perfect or even produce improvement. I have found it necessary to use a regular shaver and start growing my beard again on parts of my face.&lt;br /&gt;One reason I bought this product is that I could use it without a cord. However, I have found that my heavy, corded Wahl clippers do a far better job trimming than the Philips Norelco Multigroom Plus.&lt;br /&gt;I have used Norelco products for decades and have always experienced them to be well-made and dependable. This Multigroom Plus comes with a 2 year warranty and another 6 months is added to the warranty when the product is registered. However, mine will be going unused because I find it useless for maintaining a short, evenly trimmed beard.</li>
    <li> I like Norelco products and have used their trimmers and shavers in the past, so I looked forward to getting one of their mid-level ones. Unfortunately, after three months of use, it no longer works. I keep it clean, use it twice a week to trim stubble (as a bald man, I use the lowest stubble setting on my face and head) and occasionally trim hair on my torso, but today it stopped working in the middle of a job and could not be used further. It keeps a charge (I even tried using it while plugged in to see if that helped - it did not), but the motor has been winding down to this point for a few weeks now. It had to be used on the Turbo setting for normal use during the last few weeks, which was not the case when I first started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, maybe I expected too much of this product, but the way it is advertised suggested that it would take care of all of my grooming needs. I am about to contact Norelco  to see what they can do for me and will update this review if they offer me good customer service, a replacement, or an upgrade (or if they offer me nothing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*after contacting Philips/norelco, I have been sent a replacement because it was under warranty. Hope the new one works!</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco grooming devices for several years. This one fits into that proud tradition of a device that is pretty good at what it does, not amazing, but definitely better than trying to do it with a pair of scissors or with the little flip out trimmer thing on a standard shaver. I don&#x27;t use all of the attachments, as some of them are just weird. I think they attempt to replicate a traditional shaver, but they don&#x27;t work nearly as well as the dedicated shaver I have sitting next to it. However, as a simple beard trimmer, sideburn shaper, and mustache flyaway hair remover, it works well. I especially like the turbo mode for those particularly bushy areas of my face. Worth a try!</li>
    <li> I like this product, using it for about 3 months no problem its very nice product. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> great! Seriously, it was a good present the giftee was very surprised to receive such a loving and wonderful gift from me.</li>
    <li> I use it to cut my hair and beard, which are not very demanding, but it giver great results. I have to be careful because some of the brushes are not very hard and they bend if you press to hard (resulting in un-even hair).</li>
    <li> Less than  8 months after purchasing the clipper it just upped and stopped working.  It has been used twice a week on average. In these past 8 months it has generally been a nice little clipper,  with the biggest problem being more of a nuisance - the on/off button is in the exact place you would place your thumb or forefinger and so you keep accidentally turning off the clipper mid-clip. The turbo charge option is really a must - c, and should be  used constantly for better cutting.  The number of trimming options are nice, but the difference between 3, 5, 6, whatever are so slight that less and more definable settings would have been more useful.  I have gone back and purchased a trusty Wahl (corded) clipper, like the one I had before. One whose motor will continue on, even while the blades have dulled.</li>
    <li> was looking for cordless shaver with the screen. very hard to find and find at a reasonable price. paid  little more than I wanted but I love them. I am bald, and do a lot of grooming. I do NOT shave my head or face with these, but groom my face, eyebrows, nose, ears, even shave my body(chest, armpits, stomach, back, evenly manly areas) with this product.  the charge lasts very long. I use about 3 to 4x a week, and the charge lasts easily a month? charges very quickly, within an hour? and love one can use while plugged in, just in case the charge has become very low, contains plenty of tools to do the job, almost any job. they have been worth the price. thank you.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a Christmas gift for 2014.  The recipient has loved it and uses it weekly.  As far as we are concerned, this is the premier men&#x27;s beard/mustache groomer on the market.  We even recommended it to a couple of guys we noticed shopping in a store for a groomer and told them where they could get it (on Amazon) --- they dropped their perusal of the in-store groomers and appeared to be set on checking into this one, based on our comments.  Thanks, Remington, for making such a great appliance.</li>
    <li> Great it you want a longer beard than just some stubble showing.  Hint:  Longer beard is naturally softer to the touch without scratching.</li>
    <li> Love all the attachments, it covers everything I need and I love that it comes with a bag to hold it all as well.</li>
    <li> I got this because I wanted to start using an electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmers are very nice,&lt;br /&gt;but the foil one does not shave like it should.</li>
    <li> The head is very small and only has 1 blade for cutting hair, but you can adjust how long or short you want it.  The biggest problem is the blade gets jammed up with clumps of hair and you have to pull it out, you cannot just tap it to clear the hair.  With the blades so small, it takes longer to cut hair than with other competitors products.</li>
    <li> This model is much better than an older model I owned for many years (which finally fell apart).&lt;br /&gt;This is used about  once weekly and the battery has been holding a charge for more than a month - pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;It has all the attachments I want and need.&lt;br /&gt;No problems after 4 months.</li>
    <li> pros: High quality materials on trimmer, 1h charge time only, Nice premium design, self sharpening blades, great height adjustability on the plastic combs to give you the exact haircut length. I have used it for shortest stubble setting and a haircut, and on my face it leaves no irritation and feels very soft, yet effective and powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons: NONE, will review back after some time to report on reliability.</li>
    <li> it works great. it looks great. it feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one downside is that battery seems to be run out of juice faster than i expected from li-ion.</li>
    <li> Like this a lot.  It&#x27;s very useful for more things than I originally expected.  Lot of different attachments that allow for a full grooming experience</li>
    <li> I misplaces some of the attachments on my old trimmer so I decided to spend a little more on the new one. This trimmer is awesome, seems like it&#x27;s high quality, and when trimming it feels smooth and does not burn like the old one used to. Very happy with the purchase as long as it doesn&#x27;t crap out :)</li>
    <li> Worked well at first for about 2 weeks.  But with normal amount of blade type changes (trimmer to mini trimmer) the head is now lose such that it makes a lot of noise and pulls hair.  Not what i expected from a 50+ trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May work fine if you never make any changes to the length or style - overall a bad design.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my needs, quiet and well made.</li>
    <li> This is everything you payed for, Runs low charge it back up great for cutting those tight spots. Highly recommenced</li>
    <li> This electric razor looks stylish, but just doesn&#x27;t have enough power to get the job done.  I bought it mainly to maintain my stubble look.  Without the turbo mode engages, the groomer sounds clunky and takes forever to trim through my beard.  With the turbo mode engaged, it sounds a little more powerful, but not by much.  The trimmer on my old Braun shaver, with it&#x27;s failing ten year old battery, sounds more powerful.  This Braun trimmer is what I was trying to replace, but this Norelco trimmer just can&#x27;t compare.  It leaves some hairs uncut, meaning multiple passes are necessary, which means that a trimming that should take two or three minutes can take anywhere from five to ten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to use this for trimming hair on your head or elsewhere, it works much better.  The attachments are more than adequate.  However, I question how stable the battery is.  Mine doesn&#x27;t seem to work for long (maybe 30 minutes total) before the &amp;#34;charge me&amp;#34; light turns on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m unhappy with this purchase and would recommend it only to those seeking to use it as a grooming tool for anywhere other than your face.</li>
    <li> Great for Any trimming, I try 2 other and nothing like this one, best recommendation for a beard guy.. ladies, this is the perfect gift</li>
    <li> the product turned of great quality and use, highly recommended</li>
    <li> Well built and pretty powerful with turbo setting. Battery seems to last a long time. However, I would like to see a wet/dry version and brass blades that don&#x27;t rust.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best groomer I&#x27;ve used. I admit I didn&#x27;t like it at first. It seemed cumbersome. But after several months, I&#x27;ve come to love it. Once you figure out the settings you need - go long first then tighten it up - and can remember them, you&#x27;re good. It&#x27;s sharp and doesn&#x27;t pull. I only use one of the plastic beard guards but you might find the others useful. I do use all of the different cutting/trimming attachments though. That&#x27;s a nice add. Highly recommends. Holds a charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> Love the attachments. Love the turbo mode (great for buzzing hair on the dome). Sleek and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like how much hair can get inside the head of the trimmer. I think that happens to all trimmers but this one seems to accumulate more beard trimmings in the head more than the ones I have used in the past. YMMV.</li>
    <li> i mean for the price its an okay product, not too sharp. i think i will just let the barber trim me up</li>
    <li> Just excellent to shave my beard.&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to clean and the battery is very good. In one hour of charge it really shave for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> I really think this kind of product should be evaluated with time, but for the time being I got what I expected and it does the job perfectly - taking care of all my shaving and trimming needs.</li>
    <li> Got this as a present for my husband. He absolutely loves it! He uses all the time to trim and groom himself. His feedback to me was &amp;#34;this is a very slick, manly man present.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;the only thing is that it a bit noisy</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good in waterproof  and quality.&lt;br /&gt;My father like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;Moreover，it&#x27;s cheap than that in amazon.cn，&lt;br /&gt;and I have introduced it to my friends.</li>
    <li> After my last experience with a beard trimmer, I waited to actually use this device for a period of time before I considered rating it. I&#x27;m happy to say that this device has lived up to the hype! The attachments are well thought out and useful and I have found a use for all of them. The trimmer is lightweight, powerful, agile, and charges very quickly. I have left mine in the &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; mode the entire time as I see no reason not to. I generally used the trimmer to maintain my winter beard in manageable shape. However, the final test for this trimmer was carving out a &amp;#34;monkey tail,&amp;#34; so I could welcome spring in with some style. The trimmer worked great for this and I was more than pleased with the nicely groomed, albeit odd, results. I would recommend this trimmer to anyone looking for a powerful and easy to use beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> Charge lasts a while. It has a good amount of attachments. Great purchase I&#x27;m happy with it. Word word word.</li>
    <li> I tries using the hair clippers included and it was a little confusing with which one I needed to use in terms of the length of the hair that I wanted. Regardless, I still needed someone to get the back as doing it yourself it is very hard to get a nice clean cut. Overall not bad though.</li>
    <li> This product exceeded my expectations. Easy to charge with versatile settings and multiple blade options, It is the perfect grooming kit for me. The light weight body and quiet whirring sound is ideal for someone who cuts their own hair. I keep by hair short (to the scalp, not shaved), so the blade I use is ideal for the close cropped look. The sharpness allows for a clean and even cut, even in the back where there are some slight ridges or contours. As a black man with tightly curled hair, it is nice to find a trimming tool that gives the close cropped look without experiencing nicks and the sometimes present pseudo foliculitis (razor bumps). I am very happy with this product and use it as often as I want. I actually look forward to keeping my hair growth to a minimum. This fits my active lifestyle of being in the gym, and with rigorous workouts, washing my head is just that, with very little hair maintenance. The price also can&#x27;t be beat. The product is also easy to maintain. I would recommend this product and even purchase it again in the future if it is still available.</li>
    <li> The product is like discript, have a good performace, its simple, light, easy and pratice to manage. Good choice, I always use.</li>
    <li> It does not give you that razor cut look and feel like my last Norelco did, but you get what you pay for. My last Norelco was a $200 shaver that gave you that razor cut both look and feel.</li>
    <li> excellent shaver with minimal clean up and care.</li>
    <li> Worked great... for about a year.</li>
    <li> Love it Its a great shaver battery life is excellent i travel alot and always forget the cord so battery life was a must and this has got it</li>
    <li> Used it to shave my head completely off, worked well and also works well in keeping a stuble.&lt;br /&gt;Didnt like the nose trimmer though, could have done a better job at that; still got my money&#x27;s worth! :)</li>
    <li> Functions well as a trimmer. Attachments are cheap and clunky. Tool is over priced. Get Sirius XM, over priced too</li>
    <li> This is a excellant trimmer. The man of the house has stray hair on his meck and this gets them everytime.  Great deal!</li>
    <li> I purchased this one year ago and it had died.  It will no longer take a charge and is a complete waste of money.  DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, works well great assortment of accessories.  only complaint is that it did not come with a bag to put it all in.  if you dont purchase a bag, you will definately lose the attachments</li>
    <li> This is only for hair cutting. For beard it is uselesS VERY USELESS.</li>
    <li> my grandson said it was his best shave to date...</li>
    <li> Item shipped quickly. Item was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I use this for grooming in all parts of the body, and one thing I that sets the Norelco QG3360/42 from other cordless shavers is that you can use it on corded only. It also has the option to work on battery. 99 pct of the shavers sold, only work with rechargeable batteries. None are truly corded electric. The batteries are designed to only last 3 years, and not be replaceable. Then you are forced to buy another consumable electric shaver. This shaver can be used, than stored away when not in use, without having to worry about keeping the batteries charged. I love it!</li>
    <li> it works great and all attachments are great too... only thing is the little trimmer blade trims similar to the bigger one... i expected it to be more precise... otherwise great trimmer</li>
    <li> excellent - hubby very pleased</li>
    <li> Good item, charges fast, clips off hair as expected, is appropriate for body as well. A bit ear cleaning feature is weak, cleans out not all hair, but possible to finish with standard header.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it.</li>
    <li> This excellent product will keep you looking nice for your honey (or honeys). Good quality, many attachments, rechargeable. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> After I had this product for 2 weeks it would no longer hold a charge so it became a corded trimmer.  I travel for a living and need to rely on this product.  Another 2 weeks of corded trimming it just went dead.  Just after the 30 day return policy.  Now i have to throw it away and buy a much more reliable trimmer.</li>
    <li> I use this primarily as a beard trimmer more than anything else. It does a great job in that department. The adjustable head attachment is about on par with any other trimmer I have had.  Battery life is really good as well. I only use it once-a-week, and I charge it once a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extra&#x27;s it comes with seem to be gimmicky and do not really work. I tried the shaving foil and found it to be pretty useless. I have not tried the nose hair trimmer, so I cannot speak to that (something does not sit right about sticking a spinning, sharp object up your nose). I use the brush to clean it off and have never felt the need to test its water-resistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, not bad, but I would not say it is anything special.</li>
    <li> Received my order of this Multigroom Plus trimmer. It appears to be well made for the price. The attachments are made better than my previous Norelco trimmer. During use it trims the face very well &amp; I like it!</li>
    <li> curved blades are gentle to your skin, no more cuts or bruises&lt;br /&gt;heads are easier to change after the first try&lt;br /&gt;battery charges fast&lt;br /&gt;can be used with or without cord&lt;br /&gt;accessories included are easy to deploy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many such units and this has proven the best.  Never had a nose hair trimmer work so well.  The beard trimmers and attachments make getting what I want straightforward with no drama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t challenge the battery life, so I can&#x27;t speak to that aspect.</li>
    <li> This has been a pretty solid trimmer, the combs are a bit flimsy, if anything breaks, it will be that, and it&#x27;s a bit difficult to trim your mustache right up to your nose, but it holds a charge well, cleans up fairly easily, and does a pretty good job overall.</li>
    <li> This is a superior razor to the many others i have tried over the years.  I have a very thick beard and this does the job for both trimming and edging.  Have been using it for more than a year with no complaints.  As with any razor, it will need to be oiled occasionally.</li>
    <li> This is really great. It charges much faster than other ones we have tried. All the accessories are really nice and are easy to use. It is really sharp and makes nice even lines. It&#x27;s not too loud, like some other trimmers.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband. He is very picky about things, and they must work very well, or its just not gonna happen. Well he really loves this shaver,trimmer. Glad we found this one among the many out there.</li>
    <li> This trimmer charges quickly and has useful trimmer heads. My biggest complaint about it is that the adjustable clipper head has very small markings that are hard to see which makes choosing the right adjustment difficult. I almost gave it only three stars because of that. I do like that it&#x27;s rinsable and that it uses the same charger as my Norelco shave--if I&#x27;m going on an long trip and think I&#x27;ll need to charge one or both of them, I only need to bring one charger.</li>
    <li> Very good razor. Use it all the time to trim and shave beard and body hair. Also use it in the shower without problem.</li>
    <li> Has surpassed my expectations</li>
    <li> The has to be the best grooming kit I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  I am wholly impressed with the flexibility of this trimmer.  The battery life on the rechargeable battery is excellent, and the multiple grooming tools are well chosen.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I thought I was upgrading when I bought this....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: holds a charge well, and it is powerful, not to heavy&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The trimmer gaurds dont fit properly; they expose some of the trimmer so it leaves to an uneven cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldnt buy this again</li>
    <li> I bought 2 for my husband and stepfather. Not good after six months of slightly using it.</li>
    <li> Great Deal compared to what I had to choose from other online retailers. Also, could use my gift card I had purchased long time back !!! Thanks.</li>
    <li> I also have the [[ASIN:B00ARF42H0 Philips Norelco QQ3330/42 Multi-Groom]] version which was acquired through the Vine program. There is little difference in the two units, except this one has a metal guard whereas the other model has a plastic guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model comes with a storage pouch, a nice touch that anything with loose accessories should include. It&#x27;s nothing special. I do wish that the accessories had some sort of label on them so you know what they&#x27;re meant for. The one that has the lift looking piece is for beards. I was originally using the wrong head attachment and taking out chunks of hair to a much deeper cut than desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slider mechanism works well for hair length determination. It goes from 1mm up to 18mm (IIRC). It&#x27;ll take some playing with the find the setting you want if you&#x27;re coming from a unit that just has relative numbers. Then again, it is hair and it&#x27;ll grow back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot comment on the foil shaver, my skin is too sensitive for using foil shavers, it causes my skin to break out. It&#x27;s a solid shaver which you won&#x27;t be disappointed with.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s noisy, and is doing bad sounds</li>
    <li> Great clipper and long battery life</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my husband&#x27;s hair with this every 10 days for the past year and a half.  We&#x27;ve saved a lot of money.  It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is the shaver I&#x27;ve been looking for all of my life! It&#x27;s accurate, comfortable, has several settings, and it&#x27;s super quick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My preferred shave:&lt;br /&gt;I decided I don&#x27;t want to shave more than a couple of times a week but that I look better with at least some stubble so the Gillette Razors I was using were no longer for me. I also thought about how much I hated regular electric shavers. I tried out the quite expensive SensoTouch 3D and the 2D models and found them to be abrasive so they were returned. After searching online for a trimmer I found this beauty and couldn&#x27;t be happier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shaving habits:&lt;br /&gt;I try to maintain around 3mm of stubble, I let it grow out until about 5mm or once it gets itchy before trimming it back down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This machine does this incredibly well. I&#x27;ve never had a quicker, more accurate trim with only one pass! With the different heads you can adjust your sideburns and get your neck looking tidy. For $50, this thing is a bargain!</li>
    <li> By far the BEST multigroom tool in the market for the price! If you&#x27;re in the market for one, do yourself favor and pick this up!</li>
    <li> I have used a Wahl trimmer on my beard for 20 years. The last one finally gave out and I looked for a better trimmer. After reviewing several trimmers I decided on the Philips Norelco QG3360/42 Multigroom Plus. I have only used it 2 times but that’s more than enough. This trimmer has a sliding head guide that leaves a gap between the guide and the cutting head. You must hold the trimmer perpendicular to the face at all times if you don’t or if the skin in front of the trimmer gets pushed up as your trimming or you tilt the trimmer forward just a little you will shave instead of trim. It is almost impossible to hold the trimmer at this angle around all the contours of the face. I ended up with a patchy trim job on both occasions that looked like terrible. I’m back to a Wahl and the Philips Norelco QG3360/42 is in the junk draw.</li>
    <li> I have it 3-4 months already, and use twice a week. Still in superior shape. the attachments are very useful. will buy again.</li>
    <li> It looks like I am the only person  who actually paid money to get this groomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had it for about 6 weeks, I use it about 1/2 minute a day, and it is still going strong on the very first charge. I only use the mini foil shaver and I like it a lot. I have no experience with the other attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer noted it, the charger works on 220 volt too so, unlike most other groomers, this is great for travel. The charger itself is lightweight which is another plus..</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to others especially very good with trimming facial hair.</li>
    <li> It worked well the first few times and then I had to go over the same place over and over again to get the same result as the first few times; but that&#x27;s no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem occurred last night when I was trimming my beard - about 5 minutes in, the trimmer stopped working. I thought the battery died so I plugged it in and a couple hours later tried again and it wasn&#x27;t working. Tried again this morning and it&#x27;s still not working. The battery indicator is green, which I believe means it&#x27;s fully charged. I had to come to work with a half trimmed beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am trying to contact Philips and see it I can get another unit.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband for Christmas. He loves it. I have used it too.  It&#x27;s easy to Chang the heads.</li>
    <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Wide range of fine adjustments&lt;br /&gt;Recharger / wall adapter works 100-240VAC, suitable for foreign travel&lt;br /&gt;Works fine for a tough beard&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Does some jobs better than others&lt;br /&gt;Combs are wider than the trimming head, so detail work is a bit harder&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to get rid of a beard or mustache altogether, or if you just want to get one under control, this device will do fine.  As a bonus, it also has an ear and nose trimmer that works reasonably well.  It claims to be a hair clipper, but it is no substitute for clippers designed solely for a haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested mine by letting my rather tough and thick beard grow out for a couple of weeks, then experimented on it.  This review presents what I learned from trying it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEARD AND MUSTACHE TRIMMING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two combs you could use for this, but unless you want beard hairs longer than 1/2\\&quot;, you&#x27;ll probably use the smaller one.  The larger one covers the same range, except it goes up to 3/4\\&quot;, and it is a little larger in diameter; I&#x27;ll probably never use it.  Both combs slide on fairly easy once you figure out exactly how it is meant to go on by looking closely at the slots around the length gauge as put it together.  The gauge gives a reasonably effective measure, except it has numbers starting at 1, and it isn&#x27;t clear how long the 1 setting is supposed to be, the minimum is said to be 3/64\\&quot;.  My last use was on 4, and it was shorter than I would prefer, but hey, it&#x27;ll grow back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions advise you to comb through the hair to be trimmed against the grain, and that&#x27;s good advice.  I would further advise you to start at a setting you know will be too long, then try again a couple of notches down, and so on until you know what you want.  Eventually you&#x27;ll know what you need and just set it and use it, but at first you&#x27;ll want to experiment to find out what works best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted my neck clean-shaven, and it had been more than a week since I shaved it.  I used the trimmer without a comb to cut it down to size and had no problems with it snagging or cutting skin, but be careful if you do this, because there is not much guard left for the moving blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard is tough, and yet this trimmer had no trouble getting through it.  There is also a \\&quot;Turbo\\&quot; button that makes the motor run faster (and presumably run the battery down faster); I found I did not need to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MINI-SHAVER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer head turns a quarter turn to be removed, and the other cutters go on the same in reverse. I tried the mini-shaver to define lines around my beard, and between my nose and my mustache, for cleaning up.  It worked fine for this, but did not result in as clean a shave as my three-head Norelco shaver, not even close.  I also tried it on my neck, where my beard is toughest, and it worked poorly for shaving that clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t assume that this device will replace a good shaver, if you have much of a beard that you want to shave cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EAR AND NOSE TRIMMER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device worked well for trimming hair in these places.  The instructions advise you not to insert it in your nose more than about a quarter of an inch.  This is especially important for the ear canal, because the device is rather loud when used there.  The trimmer also works well for trimming those odd hairs that show up on the edge of ears of middle-aged men; you can move it around your ears without worry of snagging skin, and it will catch most of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are small, battery-operated ear and nose trimmers that are much quieter (due to a rotary motor) and work a little better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BODY HAIR?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say this device is for face and neck.  Naturally, it can be used for any hair anywhere, but it is not ideal as a personal trimmer.  The tips of the combs can catch on your skin, as they are a bit sharp.  A file might help take the edge off.  Also, don&#x27;t use too short a setting, as the metal teeth that move back and forth are not adequately protected from snagging actual skin.  With common sense, it does work, but they probably did not call it a personal trimmer for legal reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USAGE NOTES&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travelers will appreciate having a charger / adapter that works on 220V; not all trimmers support dual voltage (actually, all voltages from 100-240VAC).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The click-stops for the trimmer combs allow the adjustment to stay put, because they fit snugly, unlike trimmers I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Turbo button makes the motor run perhaps 50% faster.  I didn&#x27;t need that, but maybe it helps in some situations, such as using the mini-shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what \\&quot;100% water RESISTANT\\&quot; even means, because water resistant means that it is not 100% waterproof.  In any case, it looks safe to disassemble it and rinse it off in running warm water, but I would not immerse the entire unit or use it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four stars means \\&quot;I Like It.\\&quot;  It has all the features I need as a beard and mustache trimmer.  It will be helpful for cleaning up after using a conventional hair clipper for haircuts.  The nose and ear attachment works well enough.  There is nothing to complain about here, but it also does not excel: it simply does most jobs it was designed for reasonably well.  It won&#x27;t replace having a shaver and AC-powered hair clippers for those jobs.so, don&#x27;t use too short a setting, as the metal teeth that move back and forth are not adequately protected from snagging actual skin.

    <li> I am happy with this product.  After you charge it, it works perfectly to maintain the \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; look that I enjoy.  There are a number of guards to select from in order to keep yourself groomed.  It has a nice weight and feel when in use.  For me, this works like I need it to: I used to shave every 3rd or 4th day in order to keep a stubble look, now I can use the guard and keep my look all week long</li>
    <li> After my old trimmer died I went looking for a new alternative, and after a few weeks I&#x27;m glad I chose this model. Lots of different attachments, and does the job well. Only downside - no vacuum as part of this model, so it gets a little messy if you&#x27;re trimming more than a little bit of hair.</li>
    <li> I really like this device.  In the past, I&#x27;ve purchased a beard trimmer, a nose/ear hair trimmer and a number of razors with sideburn trimmers.  I&#x27;ve also wanted a barber type trimmer, but haven&#x27;t had one before this.  And, it seems to me that this groomer does a lot for a reasonable price.  I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know about its durability, but it seems to be well made and the Norelco electric razors I&#x27;ve had have always performed well, so I have no reason to expect this one to be short lived.  I don&#x27;t really need all of the types of trimmers it has, but I may in the future, so I&#x27;m happy to have it and it doesn&#x27;t seem like it costs much more to have all these options.  Being able to use the same base unit for power and charging is convenient and saves duplicative products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone who&#x27;s had various lengths of beards, stubble, goatees, mustaches, etc., I think this groomer looks like a good choice.  Someday, when my hair gets thin enough - sooner than I&#x27;m hoping - I think I&#x27;ll try this groomer to trim my hair.  It looks like it has a pretty good range of length options.</li>
    <li> Solid product.  After using cheaper trimmers, I wanted to go with a little more power.  I am really starting to like the lighter products and this is super light.  It is comfortable to hold and is smooth to maneuver over your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has lots of combs and attachments to assist with whatever you want to do.  Cool.  I like it.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for the husband&#x27;s beard, nose, and ears, but it definitely isn&#x27;t great for cutting his hair, despite the claim.  That&#x27;s okay, he really bought it for his face, but it would&#x27;ve been a wonderful bonus if it would&#x27;ve also cut his hair.</li>
    <li> Have loved to use this product, it is cheap. Been using over a year and has not disappointed till date.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Quick Charge&lt;br /&gt;Hassle free use&lt;br /&gt;Easy Clean Up&lt;br /&gt;Multiple Trimmers included&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;battery is not replaceable,&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes require multiple passes&lt;br /&gt;Comb Quality is not that good</li>
    <li> Great little razor, has a ton of features that come in handy. Especially the hair trimmer, which helps delay the evitable barbershop visit. Lot of attachments! Wish it came with a pouch or something to hold all of the extras in.</li>
    <li> Better than a dedicated body groomer. I got this instead of the more expensive model, it works better than I expected. I can do all the things with the included attachments the pricier model claims it does for $20 less. The best part it can be used plugged in when needed.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t last very long, but I enjoyed it while it lasted. In fact, I still enjoy it, but I have to hold the removable trimmer heads with my thumb while trimming, or else they fall out. I might have dropped it once or twice--so your experience may vary. The product is an excellent convenience, and a great buy for the price</li>
    <li> I had a remington before that I returned which was poor quality.  This Norelco works well, good power, seems reliable so far.  My only reason for 4 star is that the adjustment mechanism on the beard trimmer length is a bit tricky.</li>
    <li> I was just looking for something cordless that I could use for simple trimming and also to trim up my hair for a haircut.  This thing is perfect for that with multiple attachments that make it a good all around groomer.  I actually used it to cut my hair last time and it does an excellent job.  The &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; button is also a cool feature to give you a little more power if you happen to need it.  It holds a charge quite well too so barring any random problems I highly recommend this item if you need a basic hair grooming tool that&#x27;s really convenient!</li>
    <li> A gift that was greatly appreciated</li>
    <li> It does everything you think it would do, just does not trim close to the skin. For that, you need a razor. Wireless is a good feature, battery life is good as well.</li>
    <li> I love using this little guy to trim by bear and goatee. Sometimes I let my inner man free and don&#x27;t shave. I use this to trim first then shave with my beautiful double edge razor from Merkur.</li>
    <li> Everything a groomer should have!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s supposed to be just for the face but I&#x27;ve used it on the body just fine!</li>
    <li> This trimmer can handle all your facial/cranial grooming needs. The various combs and attachments ensure it can handle both short \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; beards or longer, fuller beards while also trimming flush with your beard for tidy, well-groomed look. It even includes an ear/nose trimmer to handle those difficult to shave areas. It is easy to swap attachments and the quick charging battery was than sufficient for a week of travel without having to recharge. I&#x27;ve been looking for a good trimmer that doesn&#x27;t break the bank while also being easy to use. I&#x27;m very happy with this trimmer and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> For the price I was hoping for a bit higher quality.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased around the holidays, and all was well. I was impressed.  However, it has gone from a smooth quiet tool, to a vibrating noisy tool over the past several months.  A Wahl being replaced every coupe years might be a better option</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a year. It won&#x27;t shave hairs down to the skin but it works as a bear trimmer before using an electric razor. Works better for manscaping.</li>
    <li> No complaints.  Charges fast. The only thing I dont like is the hold-all bag.  Definitely takes a couple times to get used to.  Some thing to keep in mind, its not about finding the right length so much as finding how it flows against your skin.  Some parts of my beard require a 2, while others a 3 or it shows too much skin.  Try it on a longer setting first.</li>
    <li> Great little shaver. Easy to clean, durable, chargers quickly, and easy to pack.</li>
    <li> Bought this due to its good ratings and versatility.  Multiple uses on a single charge.  Mini-foil shaver attachment works very well for shaving in areas around goatee that are hard to do with my safety razor.  Ear/nose hair trimmer works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m not giving five stars is that the guide comb design is a bit quirky, and it would be nice if there were some type of base that better holds the attachments.  The guide comb for close trimming of facial hair and eyebrows requires some care, because if you hold it at the wrong angle, the clipper cuts far too closely.  (Has to do with the way the guide fits on the clipper blade.) It does come with a based that holds all the attachments and a clear cover that goes over all of that, but you have to be very careful about not knocking some of the attachments out of it, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hoping to get a lot of good service out of it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d only ever owned a cheap battery-operated single-use trimmer before so this purchase seemed a little extravagant on one hand and as if I was setting myself up for disappointment by choosing an inexpensive model at the same time. I&#x27;m glad to say I was wrong on both accounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recently (after last Movember :) ) decided to maintain a fairly complicated beard and moustache (think Robert Downey Jr in Iron Man) and found my regular shaver lacking, even with help from my cheapo trimmer and a razor. Enter the Philips Norelco Multigroom Plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the most useful grooming tool I never thought I&#x27;d own! The ease of changing the heads for different purposes, the long lasting battery (even on turbo mode), and the variety of attachments has me completely sold on this product. I have used every attachment that it comes with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The metal guard trimmer helps make precise lines while the combs that come with it can do everything from trim hair to styling the bread and just the right length. The foil shaver helps clean up the stubble down to a smooth surface, and the precision trimmer helps with that area under your nose and in the cleanup of the chin area. Even the ear and nose trimmer do...well, exactly what you&#x27;d expect it to without having to own a device specifically for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each attachment lock onto the main body by twisting on (some are reversed from others to get the correct angle... watch for that: if it isn&#x27;t fitting on try it at 180 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it since my Movember purchase every workday and weekends where I need to look groomed and I&#x27;ve charged it twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can always keep my appearance neat between haircuts with all of the attachments provided and I&#x27;d certainly have shaved the beard off long ago if I&#x27;d had to use more frustrating tools. A great purchase!</li>
    <li> exactly what i wanted. obviously not the best of the best but perfect for my budget. slightly hard to maneuver but that should come with practice</li>
    <li> best for price.its what I expected</li>
    <li> This is a very good groomer.  It has a lot of options and the charging is real quick.  You can also use while its plugged in when the rechargeable battery dies completely.  The only problem I have with this is the amount of accessories that come with it and the tiny bag that&#x27;s included.  There&#x27;s no way that all of the brushes and attachments can fit.  Other than that, the thing is quiet and cuts great.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it pulling hair either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  I&#x27;ve owned other re-chargeable male groomers and I will say that this one has more power than all others I have tried.  I love the quick charge also, as my others needed a full charge.  Plenty of attachments also help round out this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If are in the market for one of these, I would certainly recommend you at least add this one for consideration.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco QG3360 Multigroom Plus is a fantastic multipurpose shaver.  Eight unlabeled attachments are provided to address facial grooming styles as well as nose, eybrow, and ear hair.  The unit comes with the metal guard (as opposed to plastic on the Q3330).  It also comes with an accessory pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver holds a charge very well after 3 weeks of use.  The shaver has a solid, quality feel not typical at this price point.  Compared to other versions I have owned, this product seemed to have more power and maintained the power throughout the battery cycle (others typically begin to lose power as charge diminishes). Compared to previous shavers I have owned, this is one of the quitest, especially important in early morning use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have with this product is the same I have with all others.  You must be careful to not lose the attachments.  The attachments are not stanardized among various brands or even models.  Good luck actually ordering replacement attachments.  I tried before but was not able to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note- when using cordless trimmers, it is vitally important you let the charge run down all the way before charging. Otherwise, the battery will develop a \\&quot;memory\\&quot; and take less of a charge in subsequent uses.</li>
    <li> It is a lightweight, easy to use, allround electric rechargeable groomer. You can use it unplugged or connected to the electricity while charging, which is really helpful when the internal battery is discharged. It has a lot of trimmer/comb heads with different lenghts.  I have been using it for the last year, and for the past 6 months I started to use it to cut my own hair, with excelent results. I really recommend this grooming tool.</li>
    <li> I use it to trim my facial hair daily, rather than shaving, which irritates my skin.  It does the job, but I have not tried it in the shower....not sure that I&#x27;d want to.  I&#x27;d rather just have the trimmer, than pay for all of the adapters.  The adapters aren&#x27;t bad, however, since they can be easily adjusted to fit  your needs.</li>
    <li> Perfect set everything you need</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic groom utility device.  Many trimmer heads to switch to.  I like the internal battery charger rather than using standard batteries.  The device is designed to groom every part of your face (and nose) :)  Wonderful invention!</li>
    <li> replaced my old travel one.  I love this set  holding up very well</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for a friend of mine.  He liked it so much that I bought one for myself.  I love it.  So now, I have purchased this item 17 times and given to friends and family and all seem to love it the same.</li>
    <li> Perfect item, Great price. meets my needs</li>
    <li> Avg Razor  .  as described</li>
    <li> I got this because I like the stubble look and I was tired of using multiple trimmers to maintain it (one to even out length, one to edge, one for a smooth close shave, nose hair trimmer, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does EVERYTHING. The only problem is, it doesn&#x27;t do any of it particularly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes multiple passes with the guard to get the length even, the edger/mini foil do not shave close at all and still leave a very visible stubble. I ended up having to go back to my old tools to correct the mistakes of this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND on top of all that, it irritated my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had it to do over, I would definitely NOT buy this product again.</li>
    <li> No complaints. I really like how it doesn&#x27;t take long to charge and how it can be used while plugged in. It seems to be doing a pretty good job so far.</li>
    <li> expected a closer shave, even on the lowest hair lenght setting its still a bit long for me, gets very hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall good product.</li>
    <li> Smooth blades, clean cut, brilliant product by Philips.  Was on sale for under $25!  Don&#x27;t think twice buy it now</li>
    <li> Unit is easy-to-use, and does what I expect. Attachments fit on a little awkwardly, but work fine once you figure them out. Interchangeable trimmers are easy to twist on and off. Rarely use the &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; feature. This is much nicer than my last trimmer, and I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Very good product for the cost. The quality is better and life is also better on this trimmer of  philips</li>
    <li> My trimming needs are simple and this certainly covers all of them. I typically will trim my beard once every week to two weeks and I hardly have to charge it. It&#x27;s easy to use, clean, and feels good in your hand. The plastic guards are very low tech but work well. Some clippings will end up caught between them and the trimmer so just be aware when you take them off. In all honesty I don&#x27;t know how much this model&#x27;s &amp;#34;With metal guard&amp;#34; is an improvement over the model one level down so you may want to consider it if you&#x27;re just looking for a trimmer and don&#x27;t need all the other attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately it&#x27;s a product I&#x27;m quite happy with though I would like to try one of those trimmers that also vacuum up the hair. They&#x27;re not much more expensive. In the event they weren&#x27;t reliable or I didn&#x27;t like them, I&#x27;d buy this one again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and the giftee said it works well.  It is only used to trim a beard and mustache.  The only negative so far has been the need to determine the correct length setting.  The old trimmer had distinct number settings but this one does not.  Time and practice should take care of this.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t ahve any real issues with this trimmer except for the cheap &amp;#34;accessories&amp;#34; tray you are expected to use.  Don&#x27;t bother, just use the bag the trimmer comes with.  It seems to do a good job, especially when you figure out which head you need to use.</li>
    <li> A complete box with tools for all the shaves.. Powerful motor and rapid charge time makes this product an excellent buy on amazon</li>
    <li> The attachments for this shaver are not really well thought out. They are adjustable which seems like a good idea but I found they just don&#x27;t work as well. I&#x27;m looking to replace this shaver with one that has normal, tried and tested attachments.</li>
    <li> Got what was promised and the product works great...only wished if the battery stand time could be improved more..overall I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Good and fast! I think it is a durable, util and I like too much, I recommend, thank you, bye</li>
    <li> Reasons for selecting this -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Corded use allowed.&lt;br /&gt;2. Worldwide voltage - 100 to 240 Volts.&lt;br /&gt;3. Water resistant.&lt;br /&gt;4. Price - Got it for $25($30-$5 coupon).&lt;br /&gt;5. No oil needed.&lt;br /&gt;5. Quick charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus is that it is the quietest trimmer I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s a little bulky to hold but not heavy. Very glad I bought this.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my old basic Philips Multigroomer that I had purchased more than 7 years ago.  That multi groomer ran the whole time on a single rechargeable AA battery that finally died after that length of time, so I expect even better performance out of this NiMH device.  I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but so far I have not been disappointed.  The attachments get the job done well, and everything stores easily in the included storage bag.  Looking for an economical and reliable way to put the finishing touches on a fresh shave and haircut?  Look no further.</li>
    <li> I owned a similar Phillips trimmer for several years.  It did everything I could have asked of it; and did it well.  My trimmer was stolen apparently by a baggage handler at either John Wayne airport or Phoenix airport.  I purchased this model as soon as I saw it advertised on the Amazon site.  It does everything well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  gh</li>
    <li> This is my first device and I have no troubles in using them. Good to have this and met all my daily needs.</li>
    <li> same as described...awesome very satisfied...will order one more...battery life is great&lt;br /&gt;its a total package for grooming...ideal for a gift to someone</li>
    <li> Just a short review of this grooming razor.....it has everything you need to keep you well trimmed from head to toe. I doubt that I will use the nose hair trimmer or the foil head attachment just so I don&#x27;t have to clean them.  It says in the info packet that you can use water to clean the attachments but I would rather play it safe and just use the brush that came along with it. Very impressed how close it trimmed to body, face and head!  I like the fact that you can use it with or without the cord!  I think I&#x27;ll have this for quite awhile!!</li>
    <li> Works great for me! Helps keep my beard and body hair trimmed well. I don&#x27;t use too many of the extensions besides the beard trimmer though. The power lasts a while, and the charge is pretty fast.</li>
    <li> For all your grooming needs.  Battery doesn&#x27;t stayed charged all that long but that&#x27;s what the charger is for.</li>
    <li> Works great, best clipper I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco QG3360/42 Multigroom Plus is a great trimmer. It cuts close and even and clips the hair well with the included trimmer attachments.</li>
    <li> Bought as a Christmas gift for my son in law. He absolutely loves it! He was so excited to use it, he set it all up Christmas Eve night. He was in need of a new shaver and this one fit the bill. Everything he wanted in an electric shaver &amp; trimmer. He is a very happy guy &amp; well groomed to boot!!!</li>
    <li> Perhaps I am exception rather than the rule I love norelco&#x27;s older g370 series, even after several years of use the unit still worked, however only if they made the plastic attachments more durable as these are often the first thing to break, rendering the whole item pretty useless. Sadly the new norelco adjustable trim piece is larger and look more fragile, so returned it and am trying out a LI Wahl, as i really like the indestructible nature of the wahl attachments, just hope the electronics last as long as my norelco did before the plastic trimmer comb became brittle and started falling apart.</li>
    <li> Feels slightly on the cheap side (coming from an engineering background, this would be referred to as &amp;#34;perceived value&amp;#34; ) because it&#x27;s made of lightweight plastic, but the weight is good (if it were heavier, it&#x27;d feel more expensive, but it&#x27;s fine the way it is) . The main cutter , which I use almost exclusively, is higher quality than most of the trimmers I&#x27;ve used in the past that were in this price range or cheaper. Seems like a lot of thought went into the design and engineering of it, and I expect the whole set to last a while. and if it dies on me, I&#x27;d probably buy another one.</li>
    <li> Works great. My husband loves it. Way better than what he had before. Uses it all the time and does what I needs to do. Recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product, Philips Norelco is indeed good for smooth grooming &amp; head shaving and is worth for the price coated.</li>
    <li> Superb quality and product for this price. Awesome experience.</li>
    <li> This light weight clipper is water resistant,cordless,oil proof,and gives a min of 2-3shaves per charge. Noiseless shaves with close shavin,Really cool. Very handy as u can carry it ard and comes wit its own pouch all dis for a lil fee in comparism to most. Iv bought this for most of my friends as gifts and dey LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Since there are a lot of reviews already that answer most questions I&#x27;ll just stick to how much I like it. I&#x27;ve only been using it about a week but it handles exactly what I want it to do. I like to trim my mustache and beard into what I think is called a Van Dyke. This groomer allows me to trim the small patches between my mustache and Soul Patch area easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I can think of for the price is it doesn&#x27;t collect the clippings. But everything included in the box works well.</li>
    <li> it ok wish the trimmer work a little better</li>
    <li> Shipping was quicker than expected and it looks like it will be a great gift for my son. We&#x27;ll know more come the days after Christmas as to how it works...</li>
    <li> I have to wonder why these tremors come with such fragile combs.  the ergonomics of this make it difficult not to accidentally turn the device on,  and I will probably have to replace it sooner than I would like as the guards provided are very thin plastic.</li>
    <li> It does the job that it was meant to do. It&#x27;s light weight and very easy to change out the heads.</li>
    <li> i had to send this unit back, i tried it for about a month, gave myself a haircut about every week just to be sure i wasnt using it wrong.  it was very under poweredto me, for haircuts anyway,  i just couldnt get it to cut my hair evenly and my hair ultimately just kept coming up uneven.  i bought it to go wireless, i currently use a wired one and i hate wires, im sure there is a good one out there, but this was not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;on the plus side though, the attachments seem good, and is a versatile product.  battery life seems ok but not great.</li>
    <li> I Like to much this product. It is very usefull y estetic product. The color is perfect and materials are very good!</li>
    <li> The plastic guards that are supposed to set the length of the cut don&#x27;t properly work.  They leave the bare blades exposed so as you are trimming and happen to angle the trimmer the wrong way, the bare blades come in contact with your hair and cut it very short.  This leads to patchy, uneven cuts.  I had to user scissors after trimming my beard for 20 minutes to get some of the uneven spots.  I have used this item twice and I am going to buy something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Qualifications: Beard or goatee for 16+ years</li>
    <li> If you press too hard the hair guards bend so you can&#x27;t get a very close shave. The guards are also open so if you use it at the wrong angle you will end up shaving way too close.</li>
    <li> I first purchased the [[ASIN:B005PUZZR8 Remington MB4040 Lithium Ion Powered Men&#x27;s Rechargeable Mustache and Beard Trimmer]] and was very excited to give it a try.  Sadly, I was disappointed when I tried it and found that it cut a bit too close, nicking my upper neck several times and drawing blood when used without a blade guard.  Note: this happened with the stubble blade and the regular blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After returning the MB4040, I purchased this Philips trimmer, as my old trimmer was a Philips and had performed very well for the past 5 years.  I was much more pleased with the QC3360 than the Remington.  At first, I trimmed my whole face and neck down with the regular blade, which did a pretty good job of getting the hairs down pretty short.  No nicks or cuts this time, so I was well pleased.  A few days later, it was time for some more stubble trimming, and I decided to try the \\&quot;detail trimmer.\\&quot;  I found the detail trimmer got the stubble down to just where I like it without any nicks or hair pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing that really sold me on this is the corded use.  My old Philips had to be tossed because the battery totally crapped out.  Hopefully this one will last even longer, as the ability to power it from an outlet should override any future battery problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 7/12/2013&lt;br /&gt;The corded use has proved to be excellent!  Before having to use it with the cord, I was slightly concerned about the cord length, as I had not unraveled it entirely.  However, I unraveled it and it is 6 feet long!  More than plenty long!  Also, although I initially thought the \\&quot;Turbo\\&quot; feature was somewhat gimmicky, I have found that it is particularly useful when (a) I am in a hurry, as it seriously powers through the hair, and (b) when trimming particularly course hair, such as my neck beard (neard) hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also found that I REALLY appreciate the ability to rinse this thing off in the sink.  The instructions say that the whole unit can berinsed off under what, which I have done on several occasions with no problems and much delight.  Also, the blades DO NOT have to re-oiled after rinsing under water, unlike the Remington MB4040 that I had purchased previous to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 9/10/2013&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer continues to impress with no noted flaws (yet).  I recently ventured into uncharted waters (for me) by using the foil attachment to trim my mustache area.  I have sensitive skin, so I was worried it would cause irritation.  It did not cause any irritation, it did shave very close, and it didn&#x27;t cut me either!  I was pleasantly surprised to say the least!  Just make sure you don&#x27;t apply too much pressure when using the foil attachment and I think you&#x27;ll be well pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great deal and replaced my old reliable Norelco that finally gave out.  The reason for losing a star is that the attachments, specifically the stubble and beard attachments, are a little too sharp on the pointed ends.  Be careful at first because you may just poke and cut yourself with the attachments rather than the clippers themselves.  I know some might say &#x27;of course the pointed end is sharp&#x27;, but in reality, most of these things are slightly rounded off at the points since you are only trimming and not trying to get the closest possible shave.</li>
    <li> Thus far this appears to be an overall good unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll report back if I should suffer some ingrown hairs from manscaping my back and arse hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay tuned!</li>
    <li> This is a very convenient trimmer and it&#x27;s just what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Good battery life (Almost an hour in non-turbo mode)&lt;br /&gt;Strong&lt;br /&gt;Sharp blade&lt;br /&gt;Water proof and easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that it is a trimmer not a shaver so, don&#x27;t expect much</li>
    <li> Love the product. Trims brilliantly even on close shaves. And the attachments do the work really well.&lt;br /&gt;The attachments are handy.&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is good. And charges very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only short coming I found were.&lt;br /&gt;1. Non replacable battery.&lt;br /&gt;2. The attachments are of high quality plastic but I find them very fragile and putting and removing the attachments are to be handled with care.&lt;br /&gt;3. Carry pouch is useless as it&#x27;s not&lt;br /&gt;Hard box and the attachments would break in travel.</li>
    <li> Light weight, small, easy use cuts really good. No problems went Kojak and cut hair beard no problem. Uncle Fester would be proud.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best groomer I ever had. I love that it can do multiple things, Shave, beard etc. It is well built  and has a powerful motor that can cut thru the thickess hair. I Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good groomer it does a little of everything. It works pretty good and holds a charge for me. Would buy again...</li>
    <li> My husband loves how this works because it is a complete grooming tool that takes care of facial, nose and even ear hair. The only drawback is all the attachments. He tends to lose sets with pieces, but this one comes with a nice pouch that he can hang from a hook in the bathroom. The attachment for ear hair is able to get in tiny places. I like that it is quiet. I don&#x27;t have to listen to him groom early in the morning before work. He liked his Panasonic that he could take in the shower with him, but it didn&#x27;t survive being dropped five times (guess five is the limit on those tough things). It will be interesting to see how this one holds up to being dropped a few times. If it survives more than three tumbles to the bathroom floor I&#x27;ll come back and give it five stars. It would be nice if they could find a way to have the different grooming tools convert without having to take pieces off and on, but other than that it is a great unit. My husband did comment that this gave him a closer, smoother shave than his beloved Panasonic (may it rest in peace).</li>
    <li> I was really excited when I saw this Multi-Groom Plus Shaver here at Amazon.  The minute it got here, I plugged it in for the needed 1 hour first charge (LOVE that I didn&#x27;t need to charge over night!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then proceeded to give myself a buzz cut, to get rid of my winter growth of hair and then a nice facial stubble trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE all the attachments that come with this Norelco QG3360 Multigroom Plus. It&#x27;s got the clipping comb for the hair on my head &amp; a beard and mustache comb, also the stubble comb that I use a couple times a week. There&#x27;s a mini foil and a precision trimmer that&#x27;s really handy for those tough facial spots. Also they include a Nose,Ear &amp; Eyebrow trimmer attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using various Phillips Norelco grooming products for years and I think they&#x27;re the best and this great item does the jobs of several of them, it&#x27;s a real winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a nice Large Storage Pouch for keeping the parts all close at hand.  I will be using this a couple times a week for my face &amp; several times a year for the hair on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives a nice even looking buzz cut and I&#x27;m VERY happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another GREAT Norelco</li>
    <li> Does exactly what I bought it for.</li>
    <li> Good trimmer. the battery lasts a long time, it is kind of noisy though. but overall it does the job well.</li>
    <li> Great charge. Cuts well. The attachments are great. The guards are hard to adjust to get the right hair length. The one thing I hate the most is when you hold it naturally in your hand, your thumb is directly on the on/off button. So if you squeeze too hard while trimming, you turn off the unit. Frustrating at times. But I still like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several trimmers over the years and this has out performed them all.&lt;br /&gt;Running on battery doesn&#x27;t however last 50 minutes for 60 minute charge.&lt;br /&gt;More like 25min. but it&#x27;s enough for me.</li>
    <li> This shaver worked great until it just stopped working. I used it every other day for a total of 5 to 10 minutes each time, so I see no reason for it to die so soon.&lt;br /&gt;Expected better quality from Philips Norelco.</li>
    <li> Just what you&#x27;re expecting! a great product for a great price! I&#x27;ve been using it for months and had no problems with it.</li>
    <li> Easy to clean and works very well. Charges faster and works fine for an hour after charging. Best in its kind.</li>
    <li> I like the product and works good! We have to write a story to complete the review process. So I here I go...I woke up one morning and my old trimmer died. I buried it and began to search for a new one. So, I tried this one and works great! The end!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend who after does different styles with his facial hair as well as shaving his head. He said it was much smoother and quicker than expected. He&#x27;s able to trim his beard to the perfect length and also easily achieve perfect lines when shaping without mistakes.</li>
    <li> Every guy who takes a little bit of pride in his appearance needs a grooming kit and this does the job fantastically.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a replacement to a previous Norelco trimmer set.  This one has so many more features and options than the last one, including a variety of trimmers for different hair length.  You can get a close shave, trim the beard, hair, mustache, or nose with ease.  The best part about this is the fact that the heads can be rinsed under water, unlike the previous one.  That and the little carrying pouch make it a perfect buy.</li>
    <li> This product quit working just after the 30-day return window closed. Do not purchase.</li>
    <li> After someone in my house used our old shaver on the dog... I was in the market for a new shaver. I specifically wanted to trim my son&#x27;s hair (and a few of my own pesky nose hairs). I didn&#x27;t want the cheapest out there, but wasn&#x27;t willing to spend much more than $40. This did the trick. Simple to use, easy to change out attachments. (I&#x27;m new to electric razors &amp; have no idea what these attachments do, so labels might have been helpful.) The smooth design makes cleaning easy. The noise level is same as my old one, a noticeable hum. A bag keeps everything in one spot. So far it&#x27;s kept a charge, works well and it takes care of our needs. I would definitely purchase another Phillips Norelco.</li>
    <li> I use this trimmer exclusively for beard trimming.  So far I have no complaints--it is easy to use, the combs are adjustable, it seems to be well made, is a convenient size and weight, and holds a good charge.  Although I haven&#x27;t used it for the other advertised functions, it does claim to work for nose/ear hair trimming, hair clipping, and precision trimming.  I like the travel bag which is included and the fact it is water resistant and washable.  The price seems pretty reasonable compared to other trimmers on the market.  If you are looking for a trimmer for a specific use or one with multiple uses, this is a great option.</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this product. It comes with enough accoutrements to tackle just about any shaving situation, but does none of them very well. It has a small trimmer adequate for beards, a micro trimmer adequate for really small faces, and haircutting/beard trimming attachments that look better than they perform. The nose hair trimmer sounds like it can grind down a tree stump, but misses a lot of hairs. The package comes with a micro shaving head that doesn&#x27;t do much at all.  I have had pretty good results using the larger trimmer to knock down beard growth that has been allowed to get too long. If you&#x27;re in a rush it can even pass as a rough shave, but you&#x27;ll need to get your shaver or razor after work. If you&#x27;d like to cut your hair with this unit you&#x27;d be better off just using a regular full-size clipper. However, if you&#x27;re touching up sideburns or the back of your neck the trimmer works really well. Battery life isn&#x27;t very long, but I&#x27;ve been able to get through a couple of trims before needing a recharge.</li>
    <li> 3.5 Stars&lt;br /&gt;This has quite a bit of attachments. I honestly don&#x27;t use them all but make sure to use the correct ones for each purpose. I used the hair trimmer attachment on my beard and... i &amp;#34;zogged&amp;#34; myself so be wary of that. The blade is fantastic. It&#x27;s very sharp coming from a 15 year old Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning however is a NIGHTMARE. If you have longish hair and by long i mean around 1.5 inches, this gets trapped inside of the openings of the attachments and unless you have a blower, it is a pain to clear it out. I won&#x27;t risk water in this machine as the attachments are not sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I use it to cut my hair and trim my beard and it does do this quite effectively. I get about 1 full haircut and 3 beard grooms before I have to charge it. If this is your main purpose, get this! Or else spend the extra and get the Pro version with also has the body trimmer attachment.</li>
    <li> After 8 months this trimmer still works like new. It seems to be of better quality than my previous Philips trimmer which lasted several years. One huge improvement is the shortened charge time. The old trimmer took several hours to charge. This one is good to go in under an hour and holds the charge for weeks.</li>
    <li> The motor and battery on this seem nice - haven&#x27;t had any complaints there yet. BUT the attachments are another story. It comes with a ridiculous number of attachments and they all supposed do different things. I find myself switching them alot in order to groom my face properly and that is somewhat annoying, even though they go off and on rather easily. I feel some of the attachments could be better designed: the beard trimmer for example, is too big to get in close under your nose where the moustache is out of control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also found some of the attachments cut rather selectively. Take multiple passes to get a close shave with the facial hair foil. By then, your skin is somewhat reddened and you need moisturizing lotion. Kinda defeats the purpose.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real trouble is, shaving is nicer with a hot razor but trimming is definitely easier with this so it&#x27;s a catch 22.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m glad I got it for trimming purposes and the shaving usage is just a bonus for when I haven&#x27;t made the time to properly shave.</li>
    <li> perfect gift for son.</li>
    <li> Bought 2 of these one from another brick and mortar store because it was much cheaper there. According to the people I gifted these to, they are the best they have used, Very versatile!</li>
    <li> works incredibly for a superb price, i&#x27;ve had it for several months and i enjoy it thoroughly. never had an issue with it and the battery life is very long</li>
    <li> i was in need of a new groomer without paying a fortune  for  it.  i picked this norelco groomer and i am very happy with it.  the price is right and the groomer does a very nice job on my face, ears and outside edge of my nose.  i would recommend this groomer to everyone.</li>
    <li> Had to replace an old beard trimmer and face trimmer. This thing is awesome! Cuts like a hot knife through warm butter. So many attachments. Everything you could want from a general trimmer. Seller rocks!</li>
    <li> Great grooming set!  Easy to use, holds a charge so you can just take it out and use it, and the accessories all work very well. Great value for the money!</li>
    <li> Battery seems fine.  Small attachments are fine.  Beard trimmer does not work well, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Razor worked great for 2 months then refused to take a charge. It is now out of the warranty period and I am out $60. Not a good product.</li>
    <li> I did really like it! Feels cheap.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this thing... Keeps me lookin&#x27; pristine with that perfect amount of facial hair. Love it because I look like I&#x27;m in middle school with a clean shave. With so many attachments and different razors you can really choose how long you want your hair to be. Now unless you&#x27;re on Duck Dynasty this really doesn&#x27;t matter too much for your face, but you can use this thing on your hair too. Battery lasts forever and even if it dies just plug it in and it works full speed. It comes with a nice tray and slots to store everything in as well.&lt;br /&gt;I also love using the smallest attachment to trim away chest/stomach hair as well as trimming up my neckline. Can I get a \\&quot;well-groomed\\&quot;?!?</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t very powerful so I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan to start and then it broke after 4 months.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> great quality and works very well</li>
    <li> Perfect! 10/10 Awesome for cleanups/ Lineups</li>
    <li> just what I ordered and what I needed.  I have a beginning beard that simply needs to be trimmed for even maintenance.  It has plenty of power and more attachments than I need, but others may have a use or need.  the quality will be determined over time, but so far I&#x27;m pleased with its performance and expect it will be durable</li>
    <li> This is excellent machine! I&#x27;m a gal with a mohawk haircut and I bought this to save on hairdresser costs. Turned out that it works marvels for all other hair too - armpits, legs and downstairs. The smaller haircut tip with the plastic on the shortest setting is especially great for private parts shaving. You can shave dry (nice for us who use eyeglasses and find shaving in the shower cumbersome) and results are very neat, and you can easily shave even places you can&#x27;t see without the risk of hurting yourself. Great for us who want to be neat but avoid the infection risk and stubble of razor-shaves.&lt;br /&gt; The trimming tips are great for making borders on haircut neckline. Machine is easy to clean too. When the battery is low the machine doesn&#x27;t cut that well, but charging for 10mins gets it back to it&#x27;s glory. Better than any ladyshaver or a home barber, and you get the both for the same price! I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> Multigroom Plus is the best trimmer I have owned, good replacement for cheap old unit i lived with for years.  extra attachments are a great plus and the combs give tons of length options.  Battery is not quite as good as advertised but has not left me high and dry in the middle of a trim, plus you could always run it with the cord to finish up.  Overall highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I got this the other day and promptly put it on the charge.I let it go all night so it would be ready the next day.I changed the attachment to one that would work for what i wanted and used it.It worked just fine and i had no problems.You can quick charge it if you want to use it when its dead.It has several attachments and i cant imagine you would need anymore.Ok price on it and anyone should be happy with it.A good buy.</li>
    <li> The [[ASIN:B00ARF428O Philips Norelco QG3360/42 Multigroom Plus]] is a quality grooming tool that will do just as much as many premium electric shavers for a lot less.  A razor blade still gives the closest shave but it can irritate sensitive skin.  This shaver incorporates most of the features of a premium unit.  Those who want to sculpt their facial hair will enjoy the versatility of this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;++ Versatile model can be used as a shaver, a hair clipper, and everything in between&lt;br /&gt;++ Variety of extra attachment trimmers including a foil shaver head and an ear and nose trimmer&lt;br /&gt;++ Adjustable combs allows you to trim your hair long or short, from stubble to a beard (18 length settings among 3 combs)&lt;br /&gt;++ Combs provide a comfortable trim for those with sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;++ Main trimmer cuts cleaner with less snagging than foil razors&lt;br /&gt;++ Can be used in both cordless and corded modes&lt;br /&gt;++ Trimmers can be safely used for trimming and shaping without guards&lt;br /&gt;++ Turbo feature adds just enough power to tackle thicker beards&lt;br /&gt;++ Unit re-charges fully in only 1 hour&lt;br /&gt;++ 5 minute quick charge provides 5 minutes of trimming&lt;br /&gt;++ 50 minutes of run time on a full charge&lt;br /&gt;++ Water resistant for easy cleanup&lt;br /&gt;++ Convenient travel pouch holds the unit and accessories&lt;br /&gt;++ Ergonomic slim shape is comfortable to hold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-- Can require multiple passes for even coverage in stubble mode&lt;br /&gt;-- The combs are much wider than the trimmer heads, making it harder to get a close trim around the neck and jaw area&lt;br /&gt;-- No user-changeable battery; designed to be thrown away after the rechargeable battery&#x27;s life is over&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the better ways I have found to actually trim my stubble.  I also like that one quick comb change allows me to groom my hair around my temples. The design of this unit is ergonomic, but only time will tell if it is durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> This groomer looks really nice.  In fact, this is much nicer and better built than my old groomer.  In addition, it has many more features than I have use for.  I only use it for cleaning/trimming hair and, for that purpose, it works great.  Also, the charge seems to hold pretty long even with limited use.  My old groomer would lose charge even if I don&#x27;t use it for a while.  I also like the bag it comes with, which makes storing all the pieces I need in one handy place convenient.  My old trimmer had a plastic stand that holds all the attachments, but, since I rarely use the other attachments, the whole contraption just takes up too much space.</li>
    <li> BEST CLIPPER I&#x27;VE PURCHASED IN YEARS AND I HAVE OWNED QUITE A FEW. WITH PHILIPS NORELCO YOU KNOW YOU&#x27;LL AT LEAST GET QUALITY BUILT PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> battery life is good, the comb set is very nice and useful in every angle. only one bad thing is the noise, especially when u use the small clipper.</li>
    <li> If you are buying this to trim hair above the neckline, then feel free to read no further as I purchased this device primarily for manscaping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product may be gentle enough for the sensitive skin on your face, but i promise you that it will snag on the boys... quite painfully. I will try the various attachments next time (very slowly and carefully), but only because I am too lazy to return this item. Still, my gut tells me the outcome will be similar the next time around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only wonder what would happen if I actually used the available turbo mode... yikes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving it an extra star since i am not using as advertised :)</li>
    <li> great in every way, shape, and form. great device right here. fulfills everything in description through and through. recommend to anyone with grooming needs</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and charged.  Others have reviewed the accessories that accompany this product, but suffice it to say that there is a full complement of tools for personal grooming.  The adjustable setting tool works well and allows you to trim your beard and mustache without much effort.  The included brush allows for cleaning, which is mandatory.  The main head is small enough to maneuver around the face but large enough to get it done.  And it&#x27;s priced well and appears to be excellent construction.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a number of trimmers over the years &amp; I&#x27;d say this one is below average. It&#x27;s also the most EXPENSIVE one of the bunch. They went cheap &amp; don&#x27;t supply a head guard or a hard plastic stand; I&#x27;ve gotten either or both with trimmers costing half as much (including Norelco). You&#x27;re just supposed to store everything in a travel pouch which increases the risk of damage. The turbo option is more of a gimmick than anything else. Why not just have one sufficient setting with enough power? Also, it&#x27;s not nearly as powerful as the Wahl&#x27;s I&#x27;ve owned. And it&#x27;s an inconsistent setting since sometimes when it&#x27;s turned on it starts in low &amp; sometimes in turbo mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6-05-14 UPDATE: The unit is inconsistent in it&#x27;s power output. At times it will go at full speed, other times slow &amp; sometimes it will die completely. It constantly will go back &amp; forth. This happens even if fully charged &amp;/or plugged in!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard that I&#x27;ve kept closely trimmed for over 20 years.  I believe I started out with a Wahl and swore by it for a number of years, but the technology (like shaving razors) has come a long way.  I&#x27;ve probably gone through 5 different trimmers over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last trimmer was a Philips and I liked it, but this one is significantly better. Smoother, quieter trimming that seems more even than before, probably due to the excellent plastic trimming attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason it only gets 4 stars is because of the plastic attachment, which still has to be completely slid off in order to do fine trimming. They design everything else right (and we have put people on the moon!), but they still force me to completely slide the trimming guide all the way off in order to use just the bare trimming edge?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;m very happy other than that. By far the best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> I think Philips Norelco products are quality made and well done.  The multigroom plus is no exception.  It is compact and easy to use.  It performed flawlessly for me.  It was a great replacement for the trimmer I had been using for sometime.</li>
    <li> Nothing great imo. I would rather use my old big one, this one doesn&#x27;t get close with standard trimmer head.</li>
    <li> Sometimes makes a cut at underarms but other than that its good..</li>
    <li> Can trim hair, beard and mustaches. I have nothing else to compare it to, but have no problems out of about a year of use come Christmas.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it! Just what we needed.  Great for so many things!</li>
    <li> Very versatile.  Great gift.</li>
    <li> Awesome groomer with many attachments, works great as a beard trimmer for that stubble look, nose hair trimmer, does the job well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m to sad!!!cause I bought this for present...ant they come without original box!</li>
    <li> This \\&quot;Groomer\\&quot; is what is considered and All-In-One product for men. It helps in maintaining not only the head but also the face. The Groomer comes with 6 attachment and 1 little cleaning brush. The attachments covers a wide range of uses. From cutting the hair on your head with the +18 length setting Hair Clipping comb right down to the Nose, Ear and Eyebrows with the trimmer attachment for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Groomer has a nice sleek somewhat design. It is not heavy at all. Easily fits in the hand with it&#x27;s long and slender frame. I has a power button on the front side of it. Right underneath the power button is it&#x27;s Turbo switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Groomer is can be wireless if you chose to shave that way. All you have to do is charge it (Which takes less than an hour to do) then go for it. I believe it is supposed to hold its charge for an hour or so of straight use.  Now if you do not use the whole charge at once it is recommended that you NOT CHARGE IT AGAIN UNTIL THE INITIAL CHARGE HAS COMPLETELY RUN OUT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Groomer comes in a box (that is near impossible to open) with all it&#x27;s 6 attachments plus a little brush. Its charger and a carrying pouch. I guess to carry the attachments in. Also there is a booklet with detailed instructions. Let me not forget the the packaging it came in can also be used to store the Groomer plus all its attachments, the charger, brush etc., in it. But no one would want to travel with a box everywhere I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Groomer itself works well. We have tested the Precision Trimmer and the Mini Foil Shaver so far. We have attached the +12 length setting Stubble comb and used the setting groves on the back to change the settings to see the difference betwix and between the settings. In other words to see what setting would look like what when using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good it does what you want it to do for the most part. Now no one in my house is a professional so our opinion may differ from someone who has more experience in the shaving of a head area.  As for shaving in general, my lucking volunteer and I have no complaints. Except you do have to use more pressure, force, concentration with some of the attachments then other attachments. Just be careful and judge/gauge for yourself. Don&#x27;t just jump into using this Groomer as you would any other Shaver.</li>
    <li> Received this for Christmas.  Trimmed my beard for 60 days very well, completely happy with trimmer.  Attempted to shave off my beard and killed the trimmer.  Beard was only 1/2 inch thick.  Thought it may be the battery.  Charged it for 12 hours and it still won&#x27;t start.  30 day warranty so I&#x27;m out of luck there.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco Multigroom Plus comes with four detachable heads and three combs to aid with precision facial hair grooming but it will also work on other parts of the body.  It is compact and easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two clipper attachments work quite well as does the nose and ear hair tip but the shaving attachment isn&#x27;t as effective as a standard electric foil razor.  The turbo setting is definitely more powerful than the default setting but it does use the battery faster.  There is a charging indicator LED as well as an odd little LED \\&quot;T\\&quot; that shows remaining charge.  It is easy to adjust the length when combs are attached by sliding a bar on the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little tricky attaching the heads because they have to be lined up right and twisted but there are no helpful markings to show when it is properly lined up--a couple of red or silver dots would be very helpful with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality of construction is good and a little bag is included for the accessories.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works great. It is very lightweight and easy to maneuver around your chin and jawline for trimming. Even though you may have to adjust angles to get an even cut, the precision is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the smaller attachments for nose and ear hair. (Just saying) No one wants a nose hair moustache.</li>
    <li> Grooming tools with numerous attachments for different tasks are now becoming pretty common.  My use is limited to trimming a full beard and mustache to a standard length (relatively short).  I am not putting words, symbols, glyphs or messages in there. I do use the ear/nose hair gizmo (it&#x27;s good).  I have had the product for a while, used all the attachments multiple times, and they all work well. The unit charges pretty quickly for this type of equipment, and holds the charge nicely thus far. The various attachments handle different detail functions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 minor complaints that do not affect quality or usefulness of the product: (1) the manner in which attachments twist on and off takes some getting used to. Cutters for some attachments face one direction, some the opposite (180 degrees difference). I have fumbled a bit in the morning (not so much after the 1st couple weeks) engaging some of the attachments; (2) using any attachment other than beard trimmer requires complete removal of the beard trimmer attachment, which does not retain the setting. If you are prone to forgetting such setting numbers from week to week, you may want to write this information down someplace handy. Some other trimmers I have used do retain setting numbers when attachments are removed. The difference is not tragic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, compared to 3 other comparable products I&#x27;ve used, this product delivers an excellent, uniform length result.  These products are notoriously variable in price, so you may want to keep an eye out for sales or reductions in price. Also, different models are priced from $20-$70, so if the higher end models vary only in features/attachments you don&#x27;t use, no point in paying for them.</li>
    <li> Very versatile. Does everything you would need and expect. Given the variety of blades I use this as secondary shaver.</li>
    <li> Few years back I presented one Norelco G480 trimmer to one in India. On the first use he fried the power adapter - which we realized only later to be used only with 110 V.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike that QG3360 works on 230 V also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the feature I like the most is the ability to use the trimmer while it is connected to the power supply (unlike G480 which does not work while charging)</li>
    <li> i am using it from past 3 weeks, it works well. battery life is good and looks stylish. can&#x27;t expect more than this for 25$</li>
