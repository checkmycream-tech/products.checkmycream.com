### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>And this model has proven to be the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This was a perfect replacement.</li>
      <li>None of them have gotten especially good reviews.</li>
      <li>Excellent results.</li>
      <li>Thank you for a great product!</li>
      <li>I just finished shaving my legs with this shaver, and it worked beautifully on my shins and knees.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a shaver this is a great purchase.</li>
      <li>Works great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:</li>
      <li>All in all a great purchase.</li>
      <li>I currently own a Conair and Norelco, but Remington has always worked best for me.  </li>
      <li>This was a great product.</li>
      <li>I needed a replacement and this was a good choice for the money.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this shaver thinking it would be good because of the Remington name.  </li>
      <li>I loved my Remington that I bought a year or two ago, but I dropped it and it broke.</li>
      <li>And to be fair, I have not called to see what can be done about it,</li>
      <li>I bought a Remington shaver in 2005 and loved it.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with my Remington razor.</li>
      <li>I love this razor!</li>
      <li>No matter how many times I pass a length of my leg, there are always missed hairs!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did!  </li>
      <li>...get it together &amp; get a better model out there soon!</li>
      <li>Otherwise, I am pleased!</li>
      <li>I also liked how it can be re-charged, and can be used wet/dry.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with my new shaver.</li>
      <li>Works good, and easy to use.</li>
      <li>This one nicks more than it shaves.  </li>
      <li>the company should pay more attention for that detail.</li>
      <li>Well I went to buy some more blades for my Schik Intuition razor</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s going in the trash, save your money for something better.</li>
      <li>She is equally pleased with this one.</li>
      <li>she was pleased with.  </li>
      <li>did a better job.  </li>
      <li>they don&#x27;t make them like used to that is for sure.  </li>
      <li>Because the number is lower, I thought it might not work as well or have as many features.</li>
      <li>Would be nice if battery charging light indicated when fully charged.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also need to make sure to maintain the shaver.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this razor and look forward to have a long relationship with the 4830.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>This shaver worked fine for about 4 uses</li>
      <li>skin is currently accustomed to the electric, so I get great perfectly smooth results.</li>
      <li>As for my shins and knees, they felt as smooth as a razor shave.</li>
      <li>This razor never gets my legs smooth.</li>
      <li>Comfortable to hold.</li>
      <li>Highly disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest for $5-10 go buy a pack of disposable razors at the store and shave your legs in the shower if you want a nice silky smooth shiny result for shaved legs.</li>
      <li>Maybe I feel this way because my first Remington was easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
      <li>Thought this would be great, I can use in the shower or dry.</li>
      <li>If you shave your legs more frequently it may work better for you, but if you shave once a week than this is not the razor for you.  </li>
      <li>I have never gotten a clean shave.  </li>
      <li>OK - not as good as other Lady Remington models</li>
      <li>For an older person with Parkinson&#x27;s Disease, the safety feature of an electric razor is most important.</li>
      <li>This particular model happens to be the latest.</li>
      <li>so I quickly ordered one.</li>
      <li>This Remington is no where near as good as the WDF 6000 (older model of razor)</li>
      <li>It works so much better than the new one.    </li>
      <li>aware of their Service!</li>
      <li>It is a bit loud but quieter models cost considerably more.</li>
      <li>I have used electric shavers most of my adult life.</li>
      <li>It works so much better and is safer for me than my old equipment.</li>
      <li>I honestly can&#x27;t believe that this actually made it onto a production line, let alone into the marketplace.  </li>
      <li>Performs in the bikini areas much better than old one.</li>
      <li>I was excited to buy this because I thought it would work better than a regular razor.</li>
      <li>With a full charge it doesn&#x27;t have much power.</li>
      <li>Nothing to get excited about &amp; not better or even as good as the one I replaced.</li>
      <li>previously had a Remington rechargeable shaver and loved it, but it died.  </li>
      <li>But, it does not get as close of a shave as my older one, so you have to go over the same area more times to achieve smooth skin.</li>
      <li>Overall, a good product and looks much nicer than the old beat up one!</li>
      <li>This is my first electric shaver.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I may have to go over a spot more than once, but I do that with regular razors too.</li>
      <li>My old Remington just needs one, maybe two passes and my legs and smooth.</li>
      <li>I had the earlier model which lasted many years.  </li>
      <li>Right now it&#x27;s fine for winter just doing my shins and knees, but I would recommend epilating or using a razor when wearing shorts above your knees.</li>
      <li>Would definitely come back for more!</li>
      <li>I bought this shaver because my last Remington Smooth &amp; Silky wet/dry shaver quit working after 5 years of use.  </li>
      <li>so I dont have to spend as much time in the shower.</li>
      <li>I can shave if I don&#x27;t press the shaver to my legs at all, but I also don&#x27;t get a very close shave that way.  </li>
      <li>Much easier on my skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also love that you can use it wet if you want, just like a reg razor.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really embarassing to wear shorts and have patches of unshaved hair.</li>
      <li>The  Shaver is very noisy.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Have tried everything possible to get a smooth shave.</li>
      <li>This one is much lighter and easier to use...</li>
      <li>I was so excited to finally purchase a electric razor.</li>
      <li>Clean it regularly.</li>
      <li>For the first few days/weeks/attempts, perhaps they&#x27;ll seem okay.</li>
      <li>I have had- needs a lot of back and forth, not as clean a shave.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than nothing but not worth buying twice.</li>
      <li>This is a great razor that leaves my skin feeling as smooth as I expect from an electric razor (of course it won&#x27;t be as smooth as a regular razor in the shower), however, to get replacement blades, it costs as much as the razor itself, so I have gone through quite a few razors in the past several years.  </li>
      <li>I found it on sale for half of the retail in many stores.  </li>
      <li>Regular disposable razor actually works better.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this model.</li>
      <li>(part on top of the blades) was cracked a little and my mother couldn&#x27;t tell..</li>
      <li>I had an older model that needed new screens.</li>
      <li>I bought this new model of the Remington (older version no longer made).</li>
      <li>I find that if I go back to using a blade razor that once I use the electric again it takes about 2 weeks for it to really get back to getting a perfectly smooth</li>
      <li>I bought it for my teenage daughter right before Christmas</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how the razor works, but we received a used razor when the advertised it as new..</li>
      <li>I needed a new razor after my ancient one was put to rest.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried applying more pressure, less, going super slowly, different angles, and changing to the extra blade heads that came in the package.</li>
      <li>This one doesn&#x27;t shave as well and it is harder to clean.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t pick up[ the hair on the first swipe.eed to go over several times</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I wish I had read the reviews here and on the Remington website before purchasing this shaver.  It does not work.  You can spend 40 minutes shaving your legs and still end up with patches of hair that are missed.  I&#x27;ve owned other Remington products in the past which have all been great, but the quality on this one is in the toilet.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor that leaves my skin feeling as smooth as I expect from an electric razor (of course it won&#x27;t be as smooth as a regular razor in the shower), however, to get replacement blades, it costs as much as the razor itself, so I have gone through quite a few razors in the past several years.  I wish the replacements blades/foils were cheaper so I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy a whole new razor (what a waste!).  Otherwise, I am pleased!</li>
    <li> they don&#x27;t make them like used to that is for sure.  This razor doesn&#x27;t cut the hair AT ALL. I would not recommend anyone buy this product.  If I could I would send it back.</li>
    <li> OK - not as good as other Lady Remington models I have had- needs a lot of back and forth, not as clean a shave.</li>
    <li> I love this razor! This is my first electric shaver. I used a friends a long time ago but was not impressed so I never bought one before.  Well I went to buy some more blades for my Schik Intuition razor but the store was out so I came across this.  I figured it was only a little more money than one pack of blades for my Intuition so why not give it a shot? I&#x27;m glad I did!  It gets just as close as any regular razor does and you dont have to worry about nicks and cuts.  I also love that you can use it wet if you want, just like a reg razor.  I like using it dry though so I dont have to spend as much time in the shower. Sometimes I may have to go over a spot more than once, but I do that with regular razors too. I was worried because I have sensitive skin, but it has never irritated my skin at all. All in all a great purchase.</li>
    <li> I was excited to buy this because I thought it would work better than a regular razor. I also liked how it can be re-charged, and can be used wet/dry. However this product did not work well at all. Regular disposable razor actually works better.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this is just a defective one or if they are all like this.  And to be fair, I have not called to see what can be done about it, but as a head&#x27;s up to others ordering....&lt;br /&gt;I previously had a Remington rechargeable shaver and loved it, but it died.  I bought this one because it looked to be as close to my old one as I could find, and it too was a Remington.  Terribly disappointed.  I have used it 3-4 times and EVERY time I get horrible scratches that bleed and leave marks on my legs.  I can&#x27;t locate a place on the shaver that has a bent, sharp edge or anything that I can see that might be causing the scratches.  I can shave if I don&#x27;t press the shaver to my legs at all, but I also don&#x27;t get a very close shave that way.  So, I will be throwing it away and continuing my search.</li>
    <li> Works great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: It takes your skin and hair a few weeks to get used to an electric razor opposed to a blade. If you use it once and it doesn&#x27;t work as well as you like, that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s junk, it&#x27;s just gonna take time for your hair and skin to get used to it. You&#x27;ve got to be patient when adjusting to an electric razor. I find that if I go back to using a blade razor that once I use the electric again it takes about 2 weeks for it to really get back to getting a perfectly smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is currently accustomed to the electric, so I get great perfectly smooth results. You should NOT be pressing down hard. The harder you press, the LESS hair you&#x27;ll cut because you&#x27;re smashing the hair flat against your skin preventing it from being able to be cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this I get no razor bumps, irritation, ingrown hairs, etc that are associated with using a blade razor. Much easier on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also need to make sure to maintain the shaver. Clean it regularly. If you don&#x27;t keep it clean and follow the instructions you&#x27;ve only got yourself to blame if something goes wrong.</li>
    <li> I needed a new razor after my ancient one was put to rest. This was a perfect replacement. Works good, and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I had an older model that needed new screens. It only cost $10 to get the newest model instead, and my cover was completely broken, so I got the new one. This one is much lighter and easier to use... Performs in the bikini areas much better than old one. But, it does not get as close of a shave as my older one, so you have to go over the same area more times to achieve smooth skin. Overall, a good product and looks much nicer than the old beat up one!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t give this product zero stars so it gets one. Have tried everything possible to get a smooth shave. Leaves patches of hair...and no not pressing hard. Repeated passes of the same area, and still no luck just irritates the skin.  I miss my Norelco but not much longer this pos is garbage bound. Don&#x27;t waste your money for told for warned. Wish I had read the reviews, will from now on!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver because my last Remington Smooth &amp; Silky wet/dry shaver quit working after 5 years of use.  I cannot use a blade because my skin is too sensitive and I get razor burn, but this shaver does not cut the hair on my legs or underarms. I even tried to press down harder and it still doesn&#x27;t cut all of the hair and leaves patches of unshaved hair. It&#x27;s really embarassing to wear shorts and have patches of unshaved hair. I wish that I had kept the packaging so I could return it, but unfortunately I was too trusting of Remington products to deliver what I asked for. I&#x27;ve wasted my money and you will too if you buy this shaver.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter-in-law for Christmas.  It was from a 3rd party (always bargain).  When I received it, it had someone&#x27;s hair all over the razor, inside the package.  My wife went nuts and after several emails to them, we did get our money back.  I don&#x27;t know how the razor works, but we received a used razor when the advertised it as new..</li>
    <li> Everyone using this product please be careful!!! The foil part? (part on top of the blades) was cracked a little and my mother couldn&#x27;t tell.. She used the razor and it cut her leg really bad!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my Remington razor. For an older person with Parkinson&#x27;s Disease, the safety feature of an electric razor is most important. And this model has proven to be the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, THEIR SERVICE IS TERRIBLE !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered replacement foils - received dull ones (used?) (ones I sent in for replacement?)&lt;br /&gt;Sent the foils and razor back as requested by Remington.&lt;br /&gt;Now, 3 (three) months later after requests, I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED THE REPLACEMENTS&lt;br /&gt;OR MY RAZOR.&lt;br /&gt;Be aware of their Service!</li>
    <li> This is the fourth Remington shaver that I have bought over the course of my adult life, and it is the last.  I bought it for my teenage daughter right before Christmas and it simply did not cut the hair on her legs.  When she told me that it took 1/2 an hour to shave one leg, I thought that she was crazy.  So I tried it myself, and it didn&#x27;t cut the hair on my legs either.  I returned it yesterday.  She is now sharing the Remington Shaver that I bought about 5 years ago.  It works so much better than the new one.    Remington:  please figure out what went wrong with this model.</li>
    <li> I absolutely hate this shaver.  From day one, it does not &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; the hair.  Th Remington Company should do a recall!  I would gladly accept a refund on this horrible product.</li>
    <li> I have used electric shavers most of my adult life. I currently own a Conair and Norelco, but Remington has always worked best for me.  This is one of the poorest performing razors I have ever had the misfortune to purchase.  That is not to say I will not by anther Remington, but I will definitely read the reviews and keep the packaging for a return.</li>
    <li> The only problem it has is that the trimming area of the blade always gets stuck. the company should pay more attention for that detail. It can be fixed with some all use lubricant.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for me back in December as a gift and I am very disappointed in the way it shaves. It takes about the same time as if you would use a disposable shaver in the shower but you get a rough surface left. This shaver wouldn&#x27;t cut all the hair on my legs, I would have to go over the same spot like 10 times and all it would do is leave scratches on my legs. Highly disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest for $5-10 go buy a pack of disposable razors at the store and shave your legs in the shower if you want a nice silky smooth shiny result for shaved legs.</li>
    <li> Just purchased this razor.  It is going back!  It took over an hour to shave my legs and still missed a lot.  I have had electric razors in the past that I have paid less for that did a better job.  I&#x27;m just baffled how a company known for thier razors could produce such a useless product.</li>
    <li> I have very little hair on my legs and what I do have is soft....this does not remove the hair at all. A total waste of money. I am so sorry I did not return it.</li>
    <li> This shaver worked fine for about 4 uses and then it started taking a very long time to shave my legs.  I noticed that the bikini trimmer part quit working, so I sent it in and Remington replaced it for me.  (It only cost me the $8 to ship it back to them).  I received the new razor and the same thing happened again.  I used it a few times and it quit working. If you shave your legs more frequently it may work better for you, but if you shave once a week than this is not the razor for you.  I am sure that Remington would replace this again for me, but at this point, I am looking for a different razor as this one only works about as long as a disposable razor.  Tammy Allen</li>
    <li> I had thought that I&#x27;d always use electric razors...a few years ago, they seemed to work well enough. But within the past few, I&#x27;ve had to replace my decent old ones with Remingtons (and/or similar ones? Never really paid that much attention--a razor&#x27;s a razor, ya know?) from Target, Wal*Mart, etc. This particular model happens to be the latest. It, like its several predecessors, is entirely ineffective. For the first few days/weeks/attempts, perhaps they&#x27;ll seem okay. But very soon, you&#x27;re once again disappointed and back to using only the non-electric sort. I&#x27;ve cared for these blasted things properly, never abused them in any way. They simply don&#x27;t work...you can run them over the exact same spot a thousand times until you&#x27;ve completely removed your skin, but I&#x27;d wager that 90% of the hair would still somehow be sitting there, practically waggling its ears and blowing raspberries at you. Really don&#x27;t know that I can justify owning an electric anymore; it&#x27;s not as if it&#x27;s even &amp;#34;good for small, super-quick touch-up spots&amp;#34; or anything.</li>
    <li> I have been looking everywhere for an electric razor that will replace my ten year old Remington electric razor that seems to be on its last leg. However, this one is not it. This has such a horribly weak motor and is terrible at shaving my legs. I have to press so firmly and run over the same area multiple times. My old Remington just needs one, maybe two passes and my legs and smooth. This razor never gets my legs smooth. I&#x27;m continuing my search for a razor that can actually shave the hairs, not brush over them.</li>
    <li> The razor did not meet my expectations. It did not work to remove any hair on my legs. I went back to using regular disposable razors. I was very disappointed. I tossed it in the garbage.</li>
    <li> The  Shaver is very noisy.&lt;br /&gt;The on/off button could be more outward as hard to turn on with arthritic fingers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so sorry to report that this shaver is going in to the garbage! I didn&#x27;t save the receipt so I can&#x27;t return it.  It DOES NOT shave a single hair off and if by some chance it does try to, it GRABS and pulls the hair out.  Ouch!  I can&#x27;t believe it.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  You will be throwing it out too.</li>
    <li> This is the WORST electric razor I have ever bought!!!!!!!!!! I would not recommend this to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been an electric razor user my entire life and the Remington WDF-4830 is a joke!  It holds a charge but doesn&#x27;t cut a single hair on my legs.  I&#x27;m not pressing too hard, as some have suggested but I can go over and over and over the same area and it does nothing!  I honestly can&#x27;t believe that this actually made it onto a production line, let alone into the marketplace.  This is an epic fail!  I am now resorting to using an old rechargeable Norelco.  Sadly, I don&#x27;t have the confidence to ever again purchase another Norelco.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased probably 4 or 5 WDF 5500 series razors over the years. Thought I would give this model a try. Because the number is lower, I thought it might not work as well or have as many features. But I was wrong. It&#x27;s quieter and smoother! I&#x27;m very happy with this razor and look forward to have a long relationship with the 4830.</li>
    <li> I just finished shaving my legs with this shaver, and it worked beautifully on my shins and knees. I tried doing my thighs, but gave up after a few minutes of seeing no hair removal whatsoever. I went over the same places over again, but still saw hair. I finally resorted to doing it sideways, and that was the only way I could even trim it. As for my shins and knees, they felt as smooth as a razor shave. This would&#x27;ve gotten 3 stars if it weren&#x27;t for that. Right now it&#x27;s fine for winter just doing my shins and knees, but I would recommend epilating or using a razor when wearing shorts above your knees.</li>
    <li> my wife says that it does not shave as well as her old remington.It take longer and doesn&#x27;t shave as close.</li>
    <li> This product jerks the hair out, it is painful. I didnt use it in time to return it, so I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> This razor is absolutely horrible.  I do not know why it is even still on the shelves.  It cuts a few hairs here and there, leaving strange patches.  And it takes a ridiculously long amount of time to cut the few hairs that it does cut.  It tugs and pulls the hair and is actually uncomfortable to use.  I have tried it numerous times but each time is the same--it is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Comfortable to hold. Easy to use. Excellent results. My second Remington Ladies Shaver. I highly recommend this model. Would be nice if battery charging light indicated when fully charged.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor from a local store when my well used Panasonic&#x27;s battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore. I know electric razors won&#x27;t shave as close as a blade but this one is terrible. I found that I constantly ended up with ingrown hair. I search and found that Amazon still carried my Panasonic so I quickly ordered one. This one will be taken apart to recycle the battery and trashed. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> The close shave blade did not move up and down for the long hairs it stays in on spot and I didnt like that</li>
    <li> I agree with some of the others it takes forever to actually shave. I&#x27;ve gone over the same spot 25 (I counted) and still there is left over hair also it sometimes will pull the hair. This is the worst electric razor I&#x27;ve had. I now have to buy another one and it won&#x27;t be a remmington.</li>
    <li> I loved my Remington that I bought a year or two ago, but I dropped it and it broke. I bought this new model of the Remington (older version no longer made). It does a very poor job. With a full charge it doesn&#x27;t have much power. There is a pointless bar that blocks the lower trimmer rendering it useless. This shaver can not be used on any hair that is longer than one day old stubble.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as well as my previous Remington.  It doesn&#x27;t pick up[ the hair on the first swipe.eed to go over several times</li>
    <li> This is the first electric razor I had ever used, so I didn&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s shoddy performance wasn&#x27;t acceptable. Everything others have said is true: it will skip over patches of hair and you have to bear down very hard to get it to work half-way. I recently purchased a Panasonic, and I can&#x27;t believe what I&#x27;d been missing (and putting up with in the Remington). Do not buy this razor; it&#x27;s awful</li>
    <li> Terrible razor, must go over same area 20 times for it to cut hair and I do not have coarse hair!  Worst electric razor, I have ever purchased.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I should have listened to the other comments regarding how bad this shaver is; I could have saved myself some money. Trust me this shaver doesn&#x27;t shave even if you go over and over the same area.  DON&#x27;T PURCHASE!!!</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s old shaver was a Remington she was pleased with.  So she wanted another one.  She is equally pleased with this one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver thinking it would be good because of the Remington name.  This is the worst electric shaver I have ever had.  When I use it, it shaves only a quarter of my hairs.  No matter how many times I pass a length of my leg, there are always missed hairs!  My fault - I did not get back with Amazon in time to return this item, so it will be going in the trash!!! Can&#x27;t discourage you enough to avoid this product!</li>
    <li> this product doesn&#x27;t work properly i don&#x27;t like it..i pay $32.69 for it .&lt;br /&gt;i return the product and they just gave me a refund of $18.89</li>
    <li> I bought a Remington shaver in 2005 and loved it. This one doesn&#x27;t shave as well and it is harder to clean. I don&#x27;t even like the &amp;#34;On&amp;#34; button, which seems difficult to use. Maybe I feel this way because my first Remington was easy to use and easy to clean. This one just doesn&#x27;t seem to have the quality of my old one. I have used it only on dry skin so that is all I can address.</li>
    <li> This was a great product. The cut was close and the shaver has done what the product label said. If you&#x27;re looking for a shaver this is a great purchase.</li>
    <li> Does a very poor job, takes way too many passes to shave all hair on legs. I&#x27;ve tried applying more pressure, less, going super slowly, different angles, and changing to the extra blade heads that came in the package. Nope. It wasn&#x27;t too expensive but even so it&#x27;s a total rip off and previous remington models did a better job.</li>
    <li> Terrible. Doesn&#x27;t shave anything and I had a Remington before but that one was battery operated. I would not recommend or buy this again. Plan on returning it and getting the one I had before!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to finally purchase a electric razor. I like to shave, at times before I get into the shower. I get a rash if im not really careful. Thought this would be great, I can use in the shower or dry. The first time I used it, it hardly took the hair off my legs, which is very sparse, and cut my underarms up so bad, I could hardly make it through my day at work. I tried it again, thinking maybe I was in a hurry, tring to get to work. This time, I used it in the shower, on a weekend, and was VERY careful with my underarms. Still had hair on my legs in strips where it didn&#x27;t cut and totally ate up my armpit again. I have never been so disappointed and in major pain!! If this razor cannot handle my sparse blonde hair, I cannot imaniage that it could handle some one with darker coarser hair!!!! BEWARE!!</li>
    <li> Nothing to get excited about &amp; not better or even as good as the one I replaced. It&#x27;s shaped weirdly which makes it awkward to hold &amp; frankly makes my had tired.  It doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as the ones I&#x27;ve had before. I am a veteran electric shaver user &amp; I use them exclusively so am not buying the you have to get used to it excuse. I&#x27;m actually a bit disappointed in Remington as they really don&#x27;t have good options for women&#x27;s shavers.  None of them have gotten especially good reviews. I wish I could go back in time because I&#x27;d buy several of the older models to set aside for when they die :-/ Still at least I don&#x27;t have to be bothered with shaving in the bath which is tedious so I guess that&#x27;s something! My recommendation? It&#x27;s better than nothing but not worth buying twice. Please Remington...get it together &amp; get a better model out there soon!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t shave as close as ones I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> Item just as described.......Prettier even than I imagined. Would definitely come back for more! Thank you for a great product!</li>
    <li> I had a very similar Remington model for over 10 years and only gave it up because I couldn&#x27;t find replacement blades.  This one nicks more than it shaves.  I have never gotten a clean shave.  I do always end up with nicks and a rash.  It&#x27;s going in the trash, save your money for something better.</li>
    <li> I had the earlier model which lasted many years.  I needed a replacement and this was a good choice for the money.  I found it on sale for half of the retail in many stores.  It is a bit loud but quieter models cost considerably more.</li>
    <li> This Remington is no where near as good as the WDF 6000 (older model of razor) it dosen&#x27;t cut!  Therefore it takes forever to shave if you manage it at all!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my new shaver. It works so much better and is safer for me than my old equipment. The only drawback to this one is how long it takes - I had to circle over each area several times. Where a traditional razor might take ~20 minutes to complete the task, using my new Remington it took ~45 minutes.</li>
