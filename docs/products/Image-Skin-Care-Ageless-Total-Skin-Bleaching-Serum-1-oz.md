      <li>But I&#x27;m happy with this product so far</li>

      <li>Packaged well and arrived promptly just not as strong a product as I need.</li>
      <li>I dont know if this is genuine</li>
      <li>/&gt;Image carries another serum \\&quot;Image SkinCare Ageless Total Skin Lightening Serum\\&quot; that smells really great.</li>
      <li>This bleaching serum, is extraordinary for melasma.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t work as quickly and efficiently</li>
      <li>In addition, Image continues to offer products at reasonable prices (THANK you!!), and this is one of them.</li>
      <li>I am surprised to see Image Skin Care available on here!</li>
      <li>Love Image products so far.</li>
      <li>I had some darkening around my mouth (smile line area)</li>
      <li>I love the IMAGE skin care line, the products are gentle enough for sensitive skin, but incredibly effective.</li>
      <li>I first purchased it from a day spa for $31.</li>
      <li>And even then it took several more days before the twitch stopped.</li>
      <li>I bought some for a friend with the same problems and results are better than anything else they have tried.  </li>
      <li>they will be.&lt;br /&gt;I was told at the spa to only use this serum for 3 months at a time and to always use sun screen on top of it.</li>
      <li>This product has helped reduce my scaring in one month significantly better than products I used for several months to no avail.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this serum for mild cases of Melasma like mine.</li>
      <li>I guess this is a pretty potent product so I would use it with extreme care.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so it really a win-win.</li>
      <li>One darker spot on cheek is much lighter.</li>
      <li>BUT, BECOMES VERY OILY AND GREASY</li>
      <li>The lightening process happens very gradually so one must be patient, but it does work.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Did not do much for me.</li>
      <li>I dont like the fact that there is hydroquine in this, but I dont really know of another way to lighten you skin.</li>
      <li>I used it for my back that is full of pimples spot.</li>
      <li>Follow directions, but I&#x27;ve used straight from the bottle with no irritation AND no problems with normal sunlight.</li>
      <li>I will use it for a few more months and then stop the use, as I know that the main ingredient has been known to cause cancer in certain studies.</li>
      <li>little did i know it gave me more spots...</li>
      <li>This one is safe for everyday use.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re not completely gone, but I&#x27;m confident by the end of the second month of using this serum</li>
      <li>and then other products will do fine for maintenance.  </li>
      <li>During my last pregnancy I developed two fairly large patches of Melasma on my cheek bones.</li>
      <li>i wanted to clear out my blemishes on my face.</li>
      <li>This product also has glycolic in it which keeps my skin clear and refines my pores as well.  </li>
      <li>so far so good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been super embrassared by it and used makeup to try and cover those dark spots.</li>
      <li>Two small light spots are no longer noticeable.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your sking sensitive or red, or extremely sensitive to sun rays.</li>
      <li>I like to use natural products, if possible.</li>
      <li>It is a gentle serum that lightens the dark areas and promotes exfoliation.</li>
      <li>First off after using this product for a little over a month, I noticed that i got a twitch under my left eye that did not go away until I stopped using the product.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for a few months now; and can see significant differences in the dark spots that I had from pigmentation.  </li>
      <li>It was bad enough that actually putting make-up/concealer on top of it made it so much</li>

<li> NOT HAPPY AS THE LIGHTENING STRENGTH OF 2% IS THE SAME AS OVER THE COUNTER ESOTERICA 2% A NON GREASY CREAM AND LESS MESSY AND EASY TO TRAVEL WITH AS</li>
<li> The latter does not mean sunbathing, but it does mean I don&#x27;t do anything different than my usual SPF 30 moisturizer to protect my skin when I&#x27;m running around town.</li>
<li> I can still see them if I look but they are dramaticly faded; so much so that even my husband noticed!  </li>
<li> It leaked and therefore the package was empty.......</li>
<li> that drove me crazy, so I began getting microdermabrasion treatments for others pigmentation issues, but I noticed a big improvement within the first week of usage and would recommend the product.</li>
<li> Also I have a fever blister in the corner of my mouth that flares up once in a blue moon (hardly ever).</li>
<li> I have some stubborn dark sun spots that are taking longer to fade but nonetheless this product does work.</li>
<li> I literally could not find anything to help reduce the appearance of scars on my dark complexion.</li>
<li> After a month of use, I can tell that the dark spots are fading.</li>
<li> LITTLE WHILE AFTER PUITTING ON FACE.</li>
<li> The smell is a little off putting</li>
<li> SO, NOT HAPPY ABOUT THE PRICE I PAID FOR THE SAME STRENGTH AND SOMETHING CHEAPER</li>
<li> An esthetician recommended this to me to use after I had a few IPL treatments.</li>
<li> it is a waste of your money.</li>
<li> If you suffer from hyperpigmentation and scars from previous acne this serum is the solution!  </li>
<li> I am not sure what happened.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s not surgery (and therefore you don&#x27;t need anesthesia, stitches, weird bandages, antibiotics,or to go around with a red irritated face for days, and on and on.)</li>
<li> This is a very active skin care line and MUST be monitored by a skin care specialist or doctor!!</li>
<li> I finished this bottle and its hard to say if it works or not.</li>
<li> Ive used this twice before but this product from the seller was no good.</li>
<li> It basically is a waiting game.</li>
<li> unhappy....... lost mot of product</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product works beautifully to GRADUALLY bleach out any type of pigmentation or spot. The key here is &amp;#34;gradually:: Do not expect this to work overnight. It&#x27;s not surgery (and therefore you don&#x27;t need anesthesia, stitches, weird bandages, antibiotics,or to go around with a red irritated face for days, and on and on.) If you don&#x27;t expect overnight results, this is for you. I&#x27;ve used on several parts of my face *for several months* and can definitely see the difference. In addition, Image continues to offer products at reasonable prices (THANK you!!), and this is one of them. Follow directions, but I&#x27;ve used straight from the bottle with no irritation AND no problems with normal sunlight. The latter does not mean sunbathing, but it does mean I don&#x27;t do anything different than my usual SPF 30 moisturizer to protect my skin when I&#x27;m running around town.</li>
    <li> Have been using the product for over a year.  Two small light spots are no longer noticeable.  One darker spot on cheek is much lighter.</li>
    <li> Did not work as &amp;#34;promised&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I used it for my back that is full of pimples spot. I can see the result in about a month and the serum is so easy to absorb and non greasy. But I wish it has a better smell. But I&#x27;m happy with this product so far</li>
    <li> I have melasma on my upper lip and lower chin area from pregnancy. I have had melasma for about a year and have used tons of products to lighten my skin. I have been super embrassared by it and used makeup to try and cover those dark spots. The makeup never worked, so I thought I would try another product for lightening my skin. After a month of use, I can tell that the dark spots are fading. I even asked my husband if the spots were fading and he said yes! I know that you arent suppose to use this but for 3 months on and then take 3 months off. I dont like the fact that there is hydroquine in this, but I dont really know of another way to lighten you skin. I have tried lemon, but that did nothing. I will use it for a few more months and then stop the use, as I know that the main ingredient has been known to cause cancer in certain studies. I like to use natural products, if possible.</li>
    <li> I received the product today and timely as promised....however when I opened the item it had moist and wetness&lt;br /&gt;it was sticky which tells me that it was not sealed correctly It leaked and therefore the package was empty.......&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m unhappy....... lost mot of product beause it leaked</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent: Reminds me of my hippie days.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing... Ive used this twice before but this product from the seller was no good.</li>
    <li> I saw no results I just finished. This product did nothing at all it is a waste of your money. You will not be happy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a year,  three months on then three month break using the Image skin care lightening.  Works great.</li>
    <li> Excellent product that does what it advertises!</li>
    <li> Thought this product was going to take care of my facial brown spots - but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as quickly and efficiently&lt;br /&gt;as I thought it would, possibly got an old and aged bottle....</li>
    <li> I finished this bottle and its hard to say if it works or not. I plan to buy another bottle in the winter months and take pictures before and after to see if it works or not. Love Image products so far.</li>
    <li> Did not do much for me.</li>
    <li> So i bought this product after reading so many reviews and i honestly thought it would work.. little did i know it gave me more spots...i wanted to clear out my blemishes on my face. me and my sister bought this together and we both got more spots even were we didnt have before! I dont know if this is genuine but i defo would not recommend this product!</li>
    <li> IT DOES LIGHTENING OF THE SKIN BUT, BECOMES VERY OILY AND GREASY A LITTLE WHILE AFTER PUITTING ON FACE. NOT HAPPY AS THE LIGHTENING STRENGTH OF 2% IS THE SAME AS OVER THE COUNTER ESOTERICA 2% A NON GREASY CREAM AND LESS MESSY AND EASY TO TRAVEL WITH AS DON&#x27;T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT A GLASSY LEAKING BOTTLE DROPPER. AND U CAN GET IT ON AMAZON FOR UNER $10.00 SO, NOT HAPPY ABOUT THE PRICE I PAID FOR THE SAME STRENGTH AND SOMETHING CHEAPER THAT WORKS BETTER;(</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing. I first purchased it from a day spa for $31. I had some darkening around my mouth (smile line area) that drove me crazy, so I began getting microdermabrasion treatments for others pigmentation issues, but I noticed a big improvement within the first week of usage and would recommend the product.</li>
    <li> Packaged well and arrived promptly just not as strong a product as I need. The smell is a little off putting</li>
    <li> An esthetician recommended this to me to use after I had a few IPL treatments. I&#x27;m to use this bottle then switch to the lightening serum and then continue to switch them up after each use. I&#x27;m pleased with my results.</li>
    <li> If you suffer from hyperpigmentation and scars from previous acne this serum is the solution!  It is a gentle serum that lightens the dark areas and promotes exfoliation.</li>
    <li> I buy this from the salon. It brightens the complexion and does a very good job.  It took about 2-3 weeks for noticeable results.  Only drawback is the scent.</li>
    <li> My doctor wanted me to use this product, but charges nearly double!  I have been using it for a few months now; and can see significant differences in the dark spots that I had from pigmentation.  I can still see them if I look but they are dramaticly faded; so much so that even my husband noticed!  I will continue to use this product and hope to be able to countinue to purchase it at a discounted rate.</li>
    <li> My face broke out in a burn like rash.  I applied ice most of the night to reduce the burning.  I am not sure what happened.  I will not used it again.</li>
    <li> Works gradually day by day but with patience, the results are great!!! Lightened my brown spots when nothing else would.</li>
    <li> This bleaching serum, is extraordinary for melasma. It had worked miracles for me.&lt;br /&gt;I have used dozens of other products even more expensive than this one.  It doesn&#x27;t make your sking sensitive or red, or extremely sensitive to sun rays.</li>
    <li> During my last pregnancy I developed two fairly large patches of Melasma on my cheek bones. It was bad enough that actually putting make-up/concealer on top of it made it so much worse.&lt;br /&gt;I was recently at a day spa and the therapist suggested this product so I decided to buy it - it was $36 at the spa.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the serum for almost a month now and I&#x27;m really happy with the results so far. The Melasma patches have faded a lot. They&#x27;re not completely gone, but I&#x27;m confident by the end of the second month of using this serum they will be.&lt;br /&gt;I was told at the spa to only use this serum for 3 months at a time and to always use sun screen on top of it. I&#x27;ve made sure I use upwards of SPF 20 and so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this serum for mild cases of Melasma like mine.</li>
    <li> I used this product for about 2 1/2 months only once a day.  It does work and has helped make the darker spots on my face fade, and in some cases disappear. The instructions say that you can use this product 3 months on and 3 months off. Now I don&#x27;t know if this product was a contributor to a couple of things I noticed happening, but I will explain. First off after using this product for a little over a month, I noticed that i got a twitch under my left eye that did not go away until I stopped using the product. And even then it took several more days before the twitch stopped. Also I have a fever blister in the corner of my mouth that flares up once in a blue moon (hardly ever). But that also flared up after using this product for over a month. I guess this is a pretty potent product so I would use it with extreme care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Image carries another serum \\&quot;Image SkinCare Ageless Total Skin Lightening Serum\\&quot; that smells really great. This one is safe for everyday use.  I started off with this one and did not have any problems. It basically is a waiting game. The lightening process happens very gradually so one must be patient, but it does work. I think this type of product is best used in the winter months as opposed to summer when the sun is at its most intense. But if you do elect to use this in the summer months, for Pete&#x27;s sake, use sunscreen. It would be most beneficial to keep the sun off your face period.</li>
    <li> I tried the serum. My skin turned red and rashes appeared. I think serum version may have alcohol or skin aversive content in it.</li>
    <li> I am surprised to see Image Skin Care available on here! This is a very active skin care line and MUST be monitored by a skin care specialist or doctor!! If you have a reaction, who are you going to call here on Amazon???</li>
    <li> I love the IMAGE skin care line, the products are gentle enough for sensitive skin, but incredibly effective. Will continue to order.</li>
    <li> My sister bought me this serum last year for my birthday and I love it.  My skin is radiant and flawless.  She used hers for under eye circles.  I bought some for a friend with the same problems and results are better than anything else they have tried.  My sister no longer wears concealer.  I will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> This product is a lifesaver! I literally could not find anything to help reduce the appearance of scars on my dark complexion. This product has helped reduce my scaring in one month significantly better than products I used for several months to no avail. I would recommend this to anyone who is dealing with post acne scars on ethnic skin tones. I suggest spot treating and USE A SUNSCREEN to prevent further hyperpigmentation. This serum also helps with treating acne so it really a win-win. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 2 months and it is amazing, my skin looks and feels brighter and smoother.  I have some stubborn dark sun spots that are taking longer to fade but nonetheless this product does work. You are only supposed to use it for 3 months then give your skin a rest and then other products will do fine for maintenance.  This product also has glycolic in it which keeps my skin clear and refines my pores as well.  I love all of the Image skin care products just make sure when you purchase through Amazon that it has an original seal around the opening of the bottle to ensure that it is authentic.</li>
