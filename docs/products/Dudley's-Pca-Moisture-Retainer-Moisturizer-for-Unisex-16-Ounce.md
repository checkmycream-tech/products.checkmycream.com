    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 months now...I love how it keeps my hair soft and moisturized throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Great product. I can&#x27;t find another that is comparable. Provides shine and moisture. I am a fan.</li>
    <li> I have been using PCA for awhile and usually buy it from my hair salon. Fortunately, I ran across the same product in a larger bottle at a reasonable price on this site. It was also nice that shipping was free. Just what I needed.</li>
    <li> My previous hair conditioning product would irritate my eyes during a shower and was harsh on my hands. This product is easy on my hands and is not an issue when you wash your hair. I like the smell and ease of application and the squeeze bottle is &amp;#34;really&amp;#34; squeezable. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The consistancy and color of product was not like when purchased from another seller. Was very disappointed. Although cheaper than the other company, I will pay the extra to get the one that is like the product that was once sold in beauty salons.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended it and Im glad I listened. All the comments here are true.  This product is great for black hair. If your edges or kitchen is raggedy, use this to bring them back. When my edges were breaking off, using a little on my edges grew them vack in strong, healthy  and thick and we all know that a good weave requires healthy looking edges. Also, use on little girls hair to keep it healthy and glowing. The scent is clean and light. I love the way it smells. Also, I use on weave hair when I wash it. Putting a little on before blow drying, makes your weave hair look shiny and well groomed.</li>
    <li> I have used PCA for a while now!  It gives my hair the curls I desire.  I would recommend PCA to relatives and friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used PCA for nearly 20 years, it is the best moisturizer that I have ever used.  I usually place this directly on my scalp after I shampoo because I have dry skin.  This moisturizer sinks into my scalp and feels wonderful for days.  I also place the moisturizer on my scalp before I work out, when I perspire the moisturizer seeps down my hair, and makes my hair actually look and feel better than it did before I worked out.</li>
    <li> Used it before. Very good product. Works well my hair type. Nice scent. Non greasy. Keeps my hair moist and manageable</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years on my natural hair and it work great to keep my hair soft and not dry.  It is so light I use it everyday.  I have no tried it on perms. So I do not how that would work.</li>
    <li> Very good product. It&#x27;s light, but still moisturizes very well. I will continue to use this product on my natual hair. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Dudley&#x27;s PCA moisture retainer works good, it really retains the moisture for your hair. You don&#x27;t have to use very much.</li>

    <li> My husband introduced this product to me.  He has been using it for many years.  I have been using Dudley&#x27;s PCA Moisturizer for 3 years.  Its&#x27; creamy formula  moisturizes the hair without leaving it oily, greasy or weighted down.  I have very fine hair and use a texturizer.  I cannot let my hair get dry or frizzy.  Dudley&#x27;s Moisturizer does the job well.&lt;br /&gt;I have used a number of other products, but they dry my hair or do not work as well .  This one is, by far,  the best!</li>
    <li> I love this product and I am glad I am able to purchase this item through Amazon. I have used this item for years. It is excellent!!!!</li>

    <li> Best moisturizer for naturally curly hair. I recently decided to try Shea Moisturizer Milk for curly hair, and I regretted it the moment I put it on my son&#x27;s hair, but I gave it a week. It made his hair so stiff and lacked sheen that even my 10 year old said &amp;#34; mom I don&#x27;t like this my hairs so hard&amp;#34;. Needless to say, I won&#x27;t leave PCA Moisture Retainer again. Dudley please don&#x27;t discontinue this PCA product. I have used this since he was a toddler.</li>
    <li> This has been heaven sent for my toddler&#x27;s hair that has a totally different texture from mine!</li>
    <li> Becoming. Natural can be  a pain in the butt..Trying to find products that will work for your hair.. I have been using this for a month now and my hair stays moisture. UNLIKE other products ..so I will stick to thisnand this seller thank again!!!!!</li>
    <li> I found just what I been looking for and I was very pleased with what I received. A good price for the product too</li>
    <li> This works great for my sons afro and keeps it soft and easy to comb. He uses it everyday !</li>

    <li> The product works great!</li>
    <li> Excellent, keeps your hair from becoming dry.</li>
    <li> The main reason I like this over other products is that it does not have some overpowering fragrance.  It&#x27;s also not so thick that I have trouble applying it - an important consideration because my hair is curly but not thick.
