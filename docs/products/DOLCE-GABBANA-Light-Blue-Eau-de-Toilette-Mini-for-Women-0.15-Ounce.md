    <li> Love the travel size bottle....PERFECT size for traveling</li>
    <li> Out the three items i ordered that&#x27;s the only one i have yet to receice and im having difficultys getting a new one or credit to my account so therefore i cannot give a good rating</li>
    <li> I love it. It has a softer smell to it than the perfume. It&#x27;s perfect for on the go. I&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is a small bottle but exactly what I was looking for to travel with.  I didn&#x27;t want to risk taking the larger bottle.</li>
    <li> This is a free sample and it explicitly says this on the box. I made the mistake of getting it as a small gift for someone and now I look like I&#x27;m cheap! They need to list this in the sellers description.</li>
    <li> Love the perfume. Been wearing it about 5 years now and I get many good compliments on how good I smell.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, good product</li>
    <li> Seems the bottle was so small I had a difficult time finding it in the box.  For the price, I don&#x27;t believe it was all that fair, but I love this scent so I went for it.  This bottle cannot be used when traveling as it is not leak proof.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very upset with this purchase.     When I received my package, I opened it up with excitement because I read the reviews on here, and I HAD to try it. However, When I opened my package, I saw that ALL the perfume had spilled out of the bottle. And, It wasn&#x27;t very fragrant.    What I did smell was nice, and good for a sunny day, with a nice breeze. Really casual, and light. However, It wasn&#x27;t strong enough to wear for the whole day, maybe not even 15 minutes! Very Disappointed. Maybe I&#x27;ll look for this again in the department store.</li>

    <li> Arrived quickly and nicely packaged. I ordered the sample to try it out.  This smelled nothing like the larger size bottles. I wore it twice and was not happy with it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how small it was for the price. Wouldn&#x27;t get it again.</li>
    <li> Love this, was priced right!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected. I&#x27;m not thrilled, but not completely disappointed. I rather buy this in a store opposed to online.</li>
    <li> very good 100% recommended</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance! It is definitely my new favorite. I ordered the mini for less than $10 to try out before spending Lord knows what on the big bottle. I love it so much... who cares what the big bottle costs... I am getting it!</li>
