      <li>I love this thing.</li>

      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried a Cleansing System and I can honestly say, I already feel &amp; see the difference in my skin</li>
      <li>All I know is that if you have sensitive skin, use your own cleanser with this brush!</li>
      <li>I like it so much that I bought two more for gifts!</li>
      <li>and I feel like my moisturizer gets absorbed more.</li>
      <li>I enjoy using this Dermabrush.</li>
      <li>The dermabrush is great for facial cleansing.</li>
      <li>This system is fantastic.</li>
      <li>Keeps my skin smooth and clean.  </li>
      <li>The switch and unit is sturdy and changing the attachments is super easy.  </li>
      <li>When I got this, I was super excited to try it out.  </li>
      <li>I really like the body scrub attachment as I get bumps on my legs and arms that I can smooth away easily.</li>
      <li>It really gets my face and body smooth and clean.</li>
      <li>The heads are easy to attach, and stay attached until I&#x27;m ready to switch to another one.</li>
      <li>This is a great little product.  </li>
      <li>A little more power would have been nice.</li>
      <li>This is, by far, the best product of this type that I&#x27;ve ever used (and I have used quite a few over the years.)</li>
      <li>that I have it is that it would be nice if it had multiple speed settings,</li>
      <li>mo3O4T5WRYFZ4NL]]The Dermabrush is an effective and superior alternative to the clarisonic and other similar exfoliating brushes.</li>
      <li>and it is just the right size for traveling with me.</li>
      <li>All it does is vibrate a little and tickle the face while the Dermabrush&#x27;s rotating bristles massage and cleanse your face, and it feels amazing!  </li>
      <li>This product was really good minus how quick there is a need for new brushes.</li>
      <li>three days after I first used it.</li>
      <li>This technique definitely helped my skin absorb the moisturizer soo much better.  </li>
      <li>First of all, I am a man...</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I love the different brushes the system come with.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve only used it once since I just got it yesterday &#x3D;).  </li>
      <li>First, I used the facial brush attachment in conjunction with my face wash, to give myself a good deep cleaning.  </li>
      <li>I do however love the bristles on each brush, because it is very soft and gentle especially for individuals who suffer from acne, blemishes, dry/oily/combination skin.</li>
      <li>I really like how the brush itself cleanses my skin.</li>
      <li>Anyone can really utilize this product.</li>
      <li>Highly Recommend this!</li>
      <li>Thank you for making a product for those living on a budget  enjoy the same benefits!!!!</li>
      <li>so it is ready when I need it.  </li>
      <li>The face brush has finer bristles than the body brush and is gentler, though you still need to use a gentle pressure when using.  </li>
      <li>The clarisonic claims to be more advanced due to its mysterious oscillation technology, but after seeing the video on the clarisonic and going to store that carries it</li>
      <li>the larger body brush exfoliator has helped significantly.</li>
      <li>However; what I dislike about this particular brush is the speed, it doesn&#x27;t spin very fast and you have to keep it in the natural motion that the brush spins or rotates in, because it will stop spinning.</li>
      <li>This product is great and does not cost half as much as other brushes.</li>
      <li>However; if you have a particular skin condition, ask your Doctor before purchasing this product.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;d probably do an even better job if i used it everyday</li>
      <li>Cleaned and buffed and felt like I had all new skin.  </li>
      <li>On a side note have not tried the creams that go with it as my skin is very sensitive.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a reasonably priced dermabrush, has sensitive skin, or wants to try a different brand.</li>
      <li>I recently purchased this product, because I needed a facial cleansing brush to clean any impurities off my face and body.</li>
      <li>Overall, it is a decent dermabrush at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>On the first morning, I definitely noticed a marked improvement in my skin appearance.  </li>
      <li>I do not have sensitive skin, my skin is oily at times</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really know what the buffing attachment is supposed to accomplish, but I use the face, body, and pumice attachments almost daily.  </li>
      <li>This really isn&#x27;t a problem however, and I&#x27;m storing it with the extra heads in one ziploc sandwich bag.</li>
      <li>Like one of the other reviews said it might need a little more power</li>
      <li>There is no leaking, it is completely waterproof as it claims (I did test and open the battery housing after using in the shower and drying off the outside just to see).  </li>
      <li>it only had one attachment and was rather small with little power,  while the dermabrush had 4 attachments and was more robust .  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the dirt I got out of my pores, and I am a stickler for keeping my face cleaned.  Cleaned and buffed and felt like I had all new skin.  I also have the Derma Wand, and use it in conjunction with the cleaning system.  I think this is possibly one of the best birthday gifts I will be giving my girls this year~</li>
    <li> dnt find any good results</li>
    <li> This item was as described. Arrived on time. Would purchase from vendor again. Thanks!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3O4T5WRYFZ4NL]]The Dermabrush is an effective and superior alternative to the clarisonic and other similar exfoliating brushes. I had the Olay brush only to  open and find  it it only had one attachment and was rather small with little power,  while the dermabrush had 4 attachments and was more robust .  The clarisonic claims to be more advanced due to its mysterious oscillation technology, but after seeing the video on the clarisonic and going to store that carries it I am not sold on it.  All it does is vibrate a little and tickle the face while the Dermabrush&#x27;s rotating bristles massage and cleanse your face, and it feels amazing!  Save the money and go with the Dermabrush, it&#x27;s a way better value than both the Olay brush and the Clarisonic.  With the Dermabrush you can see and feel actual results vs the tickling oscillation claims.  On a side note have not tried the creams that go with it as my skin is very sensitive.  Well worth the value plus glad too see Amazon carries it with free shipping!  See for yourself with this video, got it from their site.</li>
    <li> been using this product for a few months now. my skin has transformed. friends have even commented on a difference. the brush attachment paired with my favorite clinique cleanser has decreased my pimples (acne prone!). it&#x27;d probably do an even better job if i used it everyday like i&#x27;m supposed to. love the sponge attachment. it makes your skin glow. and i have keratosis polaris on my arms (very common - looks like i always have the goosebumps), and the larger body brush exfoliator has helped significantly. i can truly see a difference. i&#x27;m buying this product for my sister and mother for christmas this year! everyone should have one as a part of their beauty regimen!!</li>
    <li> ...wonderful product and does just what the Mia Sonic does for the fraction of the price.  Thank you for making a product for those living on a budget  enjoy the same benefits!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great little product.  I leave it in the shower so it is ready when I need it.  Keeps my skin smooth and clean.  No more blackheads around the nose. I&#x27;m still not sure what the buffer is for or how you as supposed to use it?  Wet or dry?  I&#x27;ve tried both.  A great value for the $$.</li>
    <li> The dermabrush is great for facial cleansing. It spins with good power and leaves you skin nice and smooth. I like all of the attachments that are included in it and this brush does not eat up batteries like many others do. This product is great and does not cost half as much as other brushes.</li>
    <li> First of all, I am a man...&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because i hate to wash my face and was looking for something to make the job a little easier. I like this unit and it&#x27;s attachments. My only gripe is that it just doesn&#x27;t have enough grunt. A little more power would have been nice.</li>
    <li> Found identical brush at CVS drug store not worth the price on amazon can get it cheaper at CVS, or even a bettter brand.</li>
    <li> I love it. This system is fantastic. I love the different brushes the system come with. I use it about everyday.</li>
    <li> I really like how the brush itself cleanses my skin. I think it is an excellent product! However, I used the facial cleanser before bed and in the morning (only two times) and my face is burnt! It feels like I poured acid on it and it is so dry it&#x27;s almost like I got sun poisoning in the winter! I do not have sensitive skin, my skin is oily at times but I just do not understand how my face is so red and dry three days after I first used it. Maybe it is where the brush itself scraped off a layer of dead skin and then going in and out for the holidays in the cold air is effecting it worse...who knows! All I know is that if you have sensitive skin, use your own cleanser with this brush!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m totally satisfied with this product - the cost, the shipping speed, everything.  I shopped around for a brush in this price range, and this one seemed to have the highest average user reviews.  I love all the attachments!  I don&#x27;t really know what the buffing attachment is supposed to accomplish, but I use the face, body, and pumice attachments almost daily.  My only issue with it now that I have it is that it would be nice if it had multiple speed settings, but oh well - for this price, I can&#x27;t complain!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I use it daily and it is just the right size for traveling with me. My skin feels great.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift. I still use and benefit from the purchase for myself more than one year ago.</li>
    <li> I have not had a chance to use it yet, however, it will be used often when I receive my other product.&lt;br /&gt;Pastor in Detroit</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product, because I needed a facial cleansing brush to clean any impurities off my face and body. This brush comes with four different brushes, One for the entire body, one for the Face, One for buffering/smoothing, and a Pumice stone for the ruff areas. However; what I dislike about this particular brush is the speed, it doesn&#x27;t spin very fast and you have to keep it in the natural motion that the brush spins or rotates in, because it will stop spinning. I do however love the bristles on each brush, because it is very soft and gentle especially for individuals who suffer from acne, blemishes, dry/oily/combination skin. Anyone can really utilize this product. However; if you have a particular skin condition, ask your Doctor before purchasing this product. Overall, it is a decent dermabrush at a reasonable price. You don&#x27;t necessarily need an expensive brush that&#x27;s out there in the market, and it might not necessarily work to your advantage. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a reasonably priced dermabrush, has sensitive skin, or wants to try a different brand.</li>
    <li> It came with everything it was supposed to, arrived fast, (was $25.99), and works perfectly.  I have used all of the attachments except the buffer head.  The face brush has finer bristles than the body brush and is gentler, though you still need to use a gentle pressure when using.  Both brushes do a good job at exfoliating, and I have found the best results with the pumice head attachment on my calluses than any previous method.  It is easy to use, and I have had it for over a year and have not had to replace the batteries once!  There is no leaking, it is completely waterproof as it claims (I did test and open the battery housing after using in the shower and drying off the outside just to see).  The switch and unit is sturdy and changing the attachments is super easy.  The only thing I might consider bad is that it does not come with a convenient storage system/case.  This really isn&#x27;t a problem however, and I&#x27;m storing it with the extra heads in one ziploc sandwich bag.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time for my face. Only thing I noticed is that my foot scrubber attachment doesn&#x27;t stay on too well. But still a great thing.</li>
    <li> My skin looks so much better since I started using this two months ago. My skin was dull before and now it&#x27;s vibrant and I feel like my moisturizer gets absorbed more. The biggest shocker to me was washing my face once, then again with the Dermabrush and seeing how much makeup had been left behind. I could almost swear my sun spots and freckles are less noticeable too. I like it so much that I bought two more for gifts!</li>
    <li> This is, by far, the best product of this type that I&#x27;ve ever used (and I have used quite a few over the years.) The heads are easy to attach, and stay attached until I&#x27;m ready to switch to another one. The unit itself is lightweight and easy to hold and operate. I&#x27;ve been using it in the shower to encourage the sloughing-off of dead winter skin cells, and it has really helped with my dry skin. I&#x27;m going to buy another one so I don&#x27;t have to move it around between rooms all the time, so I can also use it with face and/or foot and/or body creams at night. Its low price is a super-duper great extra benefit of this great product! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works as the reveiws said it would, see a different in my face, this is a keeper and don&#x27;t have to waste money on an expensive system, works just as well as the Clarisonic system and like that Amazon sells the replacement brushes,</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this Dermabrush. I really like the body scrub attachment as I get bumps on my legs and arms that I can smooth away easily. The only complaint I have would be I would like to see a little more power behind the brush.</li>
    <li> The product packaging on box I received had previously opened, and the product does not turn on or function.  There was no outer wrapping on the box, no paper work or instuctions in the box, and a space where something is not there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and have very dry skin.  I came across the Durmabrush and figured I would give it a try to see if it would help my dry skin issues.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried a Cleansing System and I can honestly say, I already feel &amp; see the difference in my skin and I&#x27;ve only used it once since I just got it yesterday &#x3D;).  Like one of the other reviews said it might need a little more power but otherwise it&#x27;s great!  Highly Recommend this!</li>
    <li> Worked for about 3 months, then quit.  Replacing the batteries did not help and the warranty had already run out.</li>
    <li> I just got this kit as a Christmas gift, and I love it.  I&#x27;ve been suffering from problem skin since I was nineteen.  At times my skin is dry, and breaks out.  Other times, I feel like I have an oil spill on my face.  That being said, I finally found a skincare line that balances my combination skin.  In addition to that, I felt like I needed something else to exfoliate, and refresh my skin, and masks alone weren&#x27;t cutting it anymore.  When I got this, I was super excited to try it out.  First, I used the facial brush attachment in conjunction with my face wash, to give myself a good deep cleaning.  I followed it up with the sponge attachment, and my facial moisturizer.  This technique definitely helped my skin absorb the moisturizer soo much better.  On the first morning, I definitely noticed a marked improvement in my skin appearance.  It looked a bit brighter, softer, and not as ruddy.  I can not wait to see how my skin improves with prolonged use of my dermabrush.  Terrific product.  I definitely recommend you give it a try.</li>
    <li> I use this product for cleansing my face.  This product was really good minus how quick there is a need for new brushes.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. Good quality with brush attachments for face, body and a sponge attachment for scrubs. I got it for my kids since they are starting to break out and I have a hard time getting them to wash their face. I keep it in the shower and use it daily. It really gets my face and body smooth and clean. It feels like I am getting a spa treatment.</li>
