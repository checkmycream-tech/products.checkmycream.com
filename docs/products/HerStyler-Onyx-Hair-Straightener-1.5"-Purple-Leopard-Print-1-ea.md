      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite straightener, with a pretty design.</li>
      <li>I was so excited because the people at the mall showed it to me</li>

      <li>Heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t pull hair.  </li>
      <li>it heats up so quickly.</li>
      <li>The very first one I got</li>
      <li>and that is exactly what i needed!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also super light &amp; doesn&#x27;t weight much.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this for people with straight or kinky hair just to smooth it out a bit</li>
      <li>My last straightener was amazing.</li>
      <li>it is worth it,</li>
      <li>Well worth the price on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>There is no temperature control though so its super  hot or nothing</li>
      <li>if you need it super hot</li>
      <li>or if is a good Imitation...</li>
      <li>The straightener was package so nicely with a pretty designed box same as on the straightener.</li>
      <li>Just got it a few days ago, so far it&#x27;s good &amp; straightens my hair quickly !</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>Makes hair feel smooth and soft.  </li>
      <li>I had my first Herstyler-</li>
      <li>A funny thing</li>
      <li>I  love this flat iron</li>
      <li>I love this flat iron!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had it for about 6 months now and it doesn&#x27;t heat up as fast or get as hot as it did at first.</li>
      <li>and hope it lasts just as long, if not longer :)</li>
      <li>so time to send it back and hopefully the warranty process is easy.....</li>
      <li>and it was still going strong when I left it at the hotel.</li>
      <li>only one heat setting but works fine for me.</li>
      <li>I had originally planned on getting a different brand, but after reading all the positive reviews on this one I decided to give it a chance.  </li>
      <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for really curly hair.</li>
      <li>so don&#x27;t fret over it haha).</li>
      <li>My hair is already fairly straight</li>
      <li>so i dont really mind</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>The only thing is because it gets so hot it would be better if I could control the heat when needed because 450&#x27; is hotter than you really need all the time an for controlling the damage you might get using it daily.</li>
      <li>, it does get hot quick and I have noticed the outer part of the iron stays cooler longer than another flat iron I have...</li>
      <li>When i received my flat iron i was so excited.</li>
      <li>Works better than any other straightener I&#x27;ve tried!  </li>
      <li>I am sure if it sits it will get really not, but with quick heat up time, this has limited the time it takes for me to straighten my hair.</li>
      <li>Just wish it curled my hair a little better.</li>
      <li>but so far I really like it</li>
      <li>and I new</li>
      <li>if others don&#x27;t get hot enough or straight enough.</li>
      <li>either I did research before buying it and you could easily spend over a $100.00 on this same straightener through other retailers...</li>
      <li>I have natural curly semi course hair</li>
      <li>Also, leaves your hair soft and shiny.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product! I love that it is purple cheetah and that is exactly what i needed! Such a good buy!</li>
    <li> I replaced this with my chi, and am SO happy I did. I was nervous, because the mall people are annoying, and this deterred me from buying the product. Glad I did, it&#x27;s awesome and perfect for my hair. Try their serum too!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron for my girls. I have never had a flat iron before, but I wanted to try it for myself. I liked it so much, that I decided to buy one for myself. I have never gotten so many compliments on my hair.</li>
    <li> I have only used this twice but so far I really like it, it does get hot quick and I have noticed the outer part of the iron stays cooler longer than another flat iron I have... I am sure if it sits it will get really not, but with quick heat up time, this has limited the time it takes for me to straighten my hair. I have natural curly semi course hair it makes it smooth and shiny! Can&#x27;t beat the price either I did research before buying it and you could easily spend over a $100.00 on this same straightener through other retailers... Amazon can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> HerStyler straightners are terrible!!! Not durable at all. I will honestly admit I have a habit of dropping mine. In less than 4 months I had to replace it...and just as my year warrantly ended the plates started cracking and a piece fell out. HOWEVER I dropped my CHI a ton of times and it STILL lasted me almost FIVE YEARS!!! STICK WITH A CHI!!!!! You will be disappointed with the product as far as lifespan goes.</li>
    <li> The straightener was package so nicely with a pretty designed box same as on the straightener. I would&#x27;ve loved too rate this 5 star but, you can&#x27;t adjust the heat. So using this straightener so often is a big no no for my hair even with hair protectent</li>
    <li> Her mother has always borrowed my granddaughters hair straightener so she needed one of her own.  A funny thing though she switched from giraffe to leopard.  Oh well, it works.</li>
    <li> It worked GREAT when I first bought it. It did however steam a lot the first few uses but it goes away. I&#x27;ve had it for about 6 months now and it doesn&#x27;t heat up as fast or get as hot as it did at first. My hair is already fairly straight so i dont really mind, It still works good. I would recommend this for people with straight or kinky hair just to smooth it out a bit but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for really curly hair. It also curled my hair really good at first but I have not tried it since it stopped working as well.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t have the button to change temp. like my old one. only one heat setting but works fine for me. if you need it super hot I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend it.</li>
    <li> my best friend has this one and it made my hair so shine and nice. I kept stealing hers so I just bought one... Btw chi ones. They suck. I bought it for $70 dollars and month later I had to cut my hair because it fried it. I was so upset. But now I don&#x27;t have to worry! I can&#x27;t wait to get it.</li>
    <li> Requested as a Christmas gift by my one granddaughter.  Will see what she thinks of it when she gets it.</li>
    <li> My last straightener was amazing.This one is just ok. It doesn&#x27;t have the ability to adjust the heat settings. Its good quality but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I want to buy it,but i just wanna know if the straightener comes with the bag/box and if is the same that i saw in the mall or if is a good Imitation... Thanks</li>
    <li> Just got it a few days ago, so far it&#x27;s good &amp; straightens my hair quickly ! It&#x27;s also super light &amp; doesn&#x27;t weight much. Haven&#x27;t tried curlig my hair with it yet</li>
    <li> I love this straightener, works very well. Just wish it curled my hair a little better. The herstyler serum works so great with this product though. Recommend getting the serum with it.</li>
    <li> I use nothing but HerStyler straighteners. The very first one I got, I purchased at the mall for the double the price. I was sharing it with  my sister, then moved out and had to get my own. They do wear down after a couple years (as does any), but I always buy another HerStyler. I&#x27;ve been using them for about 6 years and just got my third one a couple weeks ago. Awesome straightener if others don&#x27;t get hot enough or straight enough. I have wavy thick hair and nothing has ever worked as well as these.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item as a christmas gift for my older teenage daughter because it is an excellent straightener I have and use one myself (purchased from another company) but hers is already coming apart it seems like the tracks are getting more loose after she uses it :( so time to send it back and hopefully the warranty process is easy.....not sure yet haven&#x27;t looked into it yet.</li>
    <li> Love this!  Works better than any other straightener I&#x27;ve tried!  Also works great for making curls with it.  I got hassled at a kiosk in the mall to buy from them.  The malls sale price was around $180!!!  Ridiculous!!  Well worth the price on Amazon.  Makes hair feel smooth and soft.  Also much less damaging to hair than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener about 2 and 1/2 weeks ago and I love this straightener so much! It&#x27;s amazing. It makes my hair so soft (:&lt;br /&gt;And it heats up so quickly. It&#x27;s exactly what I needed. It works great at straightening and curling my hair, which... my curls look so cute!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron Thursday and received it yesterday In the mail I was so excited because the people at the mall showed it to me but it was 200.00 and I new dang well I would not spend that much on this product even though it&#x27;s GREAT! It IS A GREAT BUY!!! And fantastic for the price &lt;3</li>
    <li> Great straightener for a great price, does the job and even makes your hair quite shiny! I love it. It&#x27;s my favorite straightener, with a pretty design. The only thing I hate is the uncomfortable placing of the on/off button. But I have big stubby fingers.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair straightener. It looks awesome, works well and does not cost $200. Yet it performs just as well as my $200 name brand one. (I actually tossed it after doing a comparison, but I&#x27;d had it for a couple years so don&#x27;t fret over it haha). Be careful about dropping it though. The plates are ceramic, so use common sense and handle with care and it will last you a really long time with quality results. Makes my hair straight, sleek and shiny. :)</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t pull hair.  There is no temperature control though so its super  hot or nothing but that&#x27;s not a problem for me.</li>
    <li> I just left my last Herstyler straightener at a hotel 1 1/2 weeks ago and was so bummed! I had my first Herstyler-Forever straightener for 9 YEARS and it was still going strong when I left it at the hotel. It is a awsome brand and Great product if you take Great Good care of it (no dropping, etc.). Also, leaves your hair soft and shiny. I never had a problem with it pulling my hair or burning it either. I can&#x27;t wait to get this one in the mail and love it as much as my last one! :D and hope it lasts just as long, if not longer :)</li>
    <li> I chose this  rating because it heats up in matter of seconds. It reaches its maxium degree and it straightens perfectly!</li>
    <li> I  love this flat iron so cute an it gets very hot very quickly so no need to wait for it to heat up. I would recomend this to anyone.:) The only thing is because it gets so hot it would be better if I could control the heat when needed because 450&#x27; is hotter than you really need all the time an for controlling the damage you might get using it daily. Also it would be great on it if it had a close lock my old iron had one an it was great I loved that feature for storing it. Great iron it is worth it,so get it:):):)</li>
    <li> I had originally planned on getting a different brand, but after reading all the positive reviews on this one I decided to give it a chance.  Definitely glad I did.  It works fantastic!</li>
    <li> When i received my flat iron i was so excited. The packaging was done very nice. I love love love this flat iron. And so does my clients. It leaves such a nice shine to the hair and makes it very healthy and bouncy. The ceramic plates are awesome. I have recommended this flat iron to alot of people. Nothing negative to say.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! It is so easy to use, and rest in my hands comfortably. I love it!</li>
