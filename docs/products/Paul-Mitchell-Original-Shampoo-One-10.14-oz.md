      <li>Really pleased with shampoo.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s gentle on your hair and great for color treated hair.</li>
      <li>It has a coconut smell and doesn&#x27;t seem to clean as good as the original awapuhi</li>
      <li>Love that its gluten free.</li>
      <li>Light smell.</li>
      <li>if buying from Amazon has given me a genuine product.</li>
      <li>This is not the Awapuhi Original shampoo.</li>
      <li>The detangler conditioner ( I give this conditioner 5++++ stars) and can I just say my hair was smooth, soft, laying flat - just perfect!  </li>
      <li>Haveing hair on ones head is nice takeing care of it is a personal choice, and for that we strongly reccomend the Paul Mitchell hair care product line.</li>
      <li>tried this on a large section of my own hair before putting it on my whole head.</li>
      <li>This is great shampoo - I have been using it for well over 10 years and it can be used as an everyday shampoo</li>
      <li>Great for everyday use.</li>
      <li>Paul mitchell does it right.</li>
      <li>When I rinse, I let the shampoo rinse over my hair while rubbing my scalp clean, so that I don&#x27;t use too much product on my curls.</li>
      <li>the flip side, the shampoo has a warning about the product not being certified as genuine by Paul Mitchell corp unless bought from professional hair salon&#x27;s....</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t particularly care for the coconut scent but a small price to pay for a great product.</li>
      <li>Smells good, but not overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>That is exactly what happened with this particular shampoo.</li>
      <li>It also came packaged very well.</li>
      <li>every day so I like that it&#x27;s gentle.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, Item as described</li>
      <li>So cant say much about the difference it has made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Well to my surprise it left my hair fairly soft - certainly better than many other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I do this for any new hair product to make sure it won&#x27;t dry out my whole head if my hair does not like it.</li>
      <li>Gentle enough for daily use and is fine for my highlights.</li>
      <li>Having celiac disease makes it difficult to find a shampoo that doesnt give me a rash, also a great body wash.</li>
      <li>Stuff like this is great to give as gifts, every needs shampoo, and everything thinks this stuff is expensive.</li>
      <li>My favorite everyday shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I expected much better from a Paul Mitchell product, only to find out it has Alcohol in the ingredients.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and this shampoo does not weigh it down and doesnt allow my scalp to be greasy by the end of the day!</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t really think of anything bad to say about it, lol.</li>
      <li>It is clear and gel-like.</li>
      <li>Leaves your hair manageable and soft.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;*Only buy PM from an Ulta store or professional salons paulmitchell(dot)com lists.</li>
      <li>So far, i dont have any complaints.</li>
      <li>her hair comes out so soft</li>
      <li>No build up, easy to rinse, even with lake water and hard water.</li>
      <li>Personally my wife, Diane and I use the Number one shampoo, in the 20oz container, it leaves our hair clean all the way down to the scalp.</li>
      <li>I would love to keep it since I like the scent and consistency, but if using such a small amount and only focusing on my scalp dries out my hair that much, it is not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I just refill my smaller bottle, so it&#x27;s not heavy to get to my shampoo.</li>

<li> Otherwise you risk buying fake, old, or tampered product.</li>
<li> - I do wash my hair (very thick and long)</li>
<li> My hair is hard to take care of and fully cleans it and moisturizes it without leaving it looking oily.</li>
<li> You can never go wrong with Paul Mitchell products.  </li>
<li> The shampoo isn&#x27;t bad though.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have used it for years&lt;br /&gt;Good Stuff</li>
    <li> As always, Paul Mitchell products are great.</li>
    <li> Shampoo is shampoo you say, while the Paul Mitchell is not a bargain brand you find at Wall Mart, it is one the best products out there. Personally my wife, Diane and I use the Number one shampoo, in the 20oz container, it leaves our hair clean all the way down to the scalp. We also use, The Conditioner, by Paul Mitchell as well to give our hair for extra body. We have found the hair care products offered by Paul Michell to be our number one source for hair care products for more that 10 years now. Haveing hair on ones head is nice takeing care of it is a personal choice, and for that we strongly reccomend the Paul Mitchell hair care product line.</li>
    <li> Great Price for Paul Mitchell Shampoo. Its a very big bottle, will last atleast a year with me and my boyfriend. Stuff like this is great to give as gifts, every needs shampoo, and everything thinks this stuff is expensive.</li>
    <li> Paul Mitchell makes amazing products! I have fine hair and this shampoo does not weigh it down and doesnt allow my scalp to be greasy by the end of the day! Great product :)</li>
    <li> A good product at a good price.</li>
    <li> Good, love the product.</li>
    <li> The lid on this was up and I lost part of the shampoo.  Second time this has happened!</li>
    <li> Have been using this for around 3 weeks now. So cant say much about the difference it has made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a coconut like smell to it. The shampoo itself is transparent and that is a PLUS in my dictionary. So far, i dont have any complaints. The shampoo does it jobs of cleaning my hair. Yet to see long term advantage of using this as compared to over the counter shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the flip side, the shampoo has a warning about the product not being certified as genuine by Paul Mitchell corp unless bought from professional hair salon&#x27;s.... left me wonder if buying from Amazon has given me a genuine product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great! It&#x27;s gentle on your hair and great for color treated hair. Great for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I love it for my daughter hair, when I wash her hair with the shampoo her hair comes out so soft</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Light smell. Love that its gluten free. Having celiac disease makes it difficult to find a shampoo that doesnt give me a rash, also a great body wash.</li>
    <li> I have to get the jumbo size for home use because I use it every day and I never want to run out.  I love the pump that goes with this&#x27; it works great in the shower!  It also came packaged very well.</li>
    <li> Rapid delivery. I have used this product for years.</li>
    <li> I expected much better from a Paul Mitchell product, only to find out it has Alcohol in the ingredients. It made my hair frizzy. Never will buy anything from Paul Mitchell. I will keep using my Organic 6 dollars a bottle at krogers!</li>
    <li> Thanks for the great deal and the shampoo. Look forward to getting more when it&#x27;s needed- love the way it makes my hair feel! :D</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years, this was a real good price. No build up, easy to rinse, even with lake water and hard water. Smells good, but not overwhelming.  Would Definately recommend this product ,(:</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for many years.  I have many allergies and have no problem with this product.Nice clean smell and my hair feels great.</li>
    <li> You can never go wrong with Paul Mitchell products.  I have been using this shampoo for over a year now and my hair looks great.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and received product well protected in shipping container.  Thank you</li>
    <li> My favorite everyday shampoo.  Clean feeling, clean rinsing, smells great.</li>
    <li> The ONLY SHAMPOO I&#x27;ve used for 30 years! Its gentle, and the best!!!</li>
    <li> Smells nice, cleans well, good size with efficient shipping!</li>
    <li> 3c/4a coil curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant, neutral scent. It smells like baby to me. It is clear and gel-like. That&#x27;s all that I like about it, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this on a large section of my own hair before putting it on my whole head. I do this for any new hair product to make sure it won&#x27;t dry out my whole head if my hair does not like it. That is exactly what happened with this particular shampoo. I only used the tiniest amount, and focused it all on my scalp. When I rinse, I let the shampoo rinse over my hair while rubbing my scalp clean, so that I don&#x27;t use too much product on my curls. I could immediately tell my hair was drying out. I didn&#x27;t like the feeling. I checked in the mirror ad my curls were dry. I immediately co washed with a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am returning this bottle to Ulta, where I purchased from. I would love to keep it since I like the scent and consistency, but if using such a small amount and only focusing on my scalp dries out my hair that much, it is not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Only buy PM from an Ulta store or professional salons paulmitchell(dot)com lists. Otherwise you risk buying fake, old, or tampered product.</li>
    <li> This is not the Awapuhi Original shampoo. I know, if I read the label correctly that would be obvious. The shampoo isn&#x27;t bad though. It has a coconut smell and doesn&#x27;t seem to clean as good as the original awapuhi but that could all be in my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo works, smells coconutty.</li>
    <li> Product is as expected.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This price beats any store price I can find. I have highlighted hair and this was recommended by my hair stylist. I just refill my smaller bottle, so it&#x27;s not heavy to get to my shampoo. This is an excellent product for me.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, I have used it before and then could never find it again. It is great for any type hair and always leaves it clean with a lightweight feeling. My hair is hard to take care of and fully cleans it and moisturizes it without leaving it looking oily.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, Item as described</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo, but I may not buy it online again.  The bottle was not properly taped shut and leaked all over the inside of the box.</li>
    <li> I love the Paul itchell products &amp; so does my family - I even purchased one for my brother</li>
    <li> Still my favorite shampoo</li>
    <li> So as soon as I squeezed out some shampoo and saw that it was not creamy, I got scared but since I had already invested in the big liter bottle I figured I had to at least give it a try. Well to my surprise it left my hair fairly soft - certainly better than many other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried. Then I followed up with PM The detangler conditioner ( I give this conditioner 5++++ stars) and can I just say my hair was smooth, soft, laying flat - just perfect!  I&#x27;ve tried PM shampoo in the past  and didn&#x27;t particularly like them  but  I actually bought this one from a SALON so maybe that was the difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results I achieved are really good considering I&#x27;m transitioning from relaxed hair.  I have shoulder length,  thinning (from age and years of  relaxing) hair. Really pleased with shampoo.</li>
    <li> This is great shampoo - I have been using it for well over 10 years and it can be used as an everyday shampoo - I do wash my hair (very thick and long) every day so I like that it&#x27;s gentle. I switch between various shampoos/conditioners throughout the months but this one is my go to when I am in between others that I like to try.  I use it with Nexus Humectress conditioner.  Got it from the vendor on time and no mishaps</li>
    <li> Great shampoo!  Can&#x27;t really think of anything bad to say about it, lol.</li>
    <li> Nice products and cheaper than you can buy in a salon or at a cvs/walgreens. Gentle enough for daily use and is fine for my highlights.</li>
    <li> Amazing. l started using it a few months ago and I adore it. Smells like coconut and lathers up quite nicely. Paul mitchell does it right.</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair manageable and soft.  Don&#x27;t particularly care for the coconut scent but a small price to pay for a great product.</li>
