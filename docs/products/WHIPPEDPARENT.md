<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product has superior moisturizing qualities.  I have never used a product that has been so effective.  I have scrunched it in my hair, I&#x27;ve used it on my face, I have rubbed it into my arms, elbows, legs, etc.  It is multi-purpose and works as one product for any part of the body.  I have a fragrance sensitivity, so this is good for me because it is unscented.  It has a different texture from other moisturizers.  I rub it into my hands for a few seconds and &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; it before applying it and it works great.</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with my purchase it did wonders for my dry skin, my order arrived very quickly and most of all i feel i received a top quality product for the right price.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s clean and healthy and does the job better than any fancy products I have used in the past. I will be a lifetime customer!</li>
    <li> Great product! I used it one time (overnight) and it left my skin smooth and soft next morning. I&#x27;ve been having problems with dry skin and this Shea Butter really helped my skin. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something that was more along the lines of natural for &#x27;baby lotion&#x27; as there seems to be a lot of scent and &#x27;other&#x27; ingredients in a majority of baby lotion. It was suggested to me to check out this shea butter. Not only does it work for baby and diaper lotion but it also handles my rough skin! What momma doesn&#x27;t enjoy that? I&#x27;ve only had the product for about a week now and I can tell that not only do I love it but will be ordering more! I highly suggest this if you are looking for something that will aid in smooth skin!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent, all-natural moisturizer.  I have used it for a few weeks now, and I have been very pleased.  Actually, I noticed improvement the day I started using it, but I waited to write my review to see if I was happy with the results over time. I certainly am.  I live in a dry climate and doing house and yard work plays havoc with my cuticles. But with this product, I no longer have constantly cracked and painful splits in the skin around my nails.  Another reason I wanted to try out this product is that I have had several surgeries, and I have a lot of scar tissue on my abdomen.  While I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in the appearance of my scars, I am pleased with the moisturizing effect on my skin.  The only reason I am not giving this product five stars is that the natural smell of the shea butter is not pleasing to me.  I do think it is nicer, though, than creams that are laden with perfumes.</li>
    <li> Excellent I&#x27;m so glad I bought it thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been much of trying let alone writing a review on this type of products. One of my friends mentioned this product to me and i honestly thought it was another one of those &amp;#34; miracle shea butters&amp;#34; thats suppose to change your life. Well its actually hard to believe but this product actually works. At first i bought it just to test it and see how real it was now that i sometimes suffer from dry skin. Well lets just say that this product has made it around to different members of my family. My sister after having 3 kids has been using it and she is able to see the difference in regards to dry skin stretch-marks and the whole 9 yards. My nephew who suffers for eczema has been using it and it has helped so much! The dry skin gets handled super quick. This shea butter actually works and is a great moisturizer. I am over all surprised and happy with this product and its performance. Definitely something i would recommend!</li>
    <li> This product works!  It keeps my skin moisturized and healthy-looking, AND keeps the eczema at bay!</li>
    <li> I must say I have tried shea butter in the past and have had no success.  I would give up trying to get it out of the container, or the smell was too overpowering.  My husbands Aunt would swear by it &amp; say that it had so many healing qualities but until a few days ago I just couldn’t see it.  First let me start by saying that it was not hard to get it out of the container, and it has a light scent to it, nothing overpowering.  I am simply AMAZED!!  I have very dry skin and have eczema as well, this shea butter feels WONDERFUL!!! My skin feels so soft, even hours after applying it.  There is no greasy feel to it, my skin just feels silky.  I absolutely LOVE this shea butter!!!! I am looking forward to continued use to see how it works with my eczema as well as several scars I have, as it is suppose to help with both.  I would definitely recommend this product and can say I am now a BELIEVER in Shea Butter!!!!!  I received this product at a deep discount for my honest an unbiased review and opinion. As always I test and use my products before leaving my 100% honest review.</li>
    <li> This Shea butter is really great, its non greasy and its as if your skin was thirsty and it finally found water. I also liked that its whipped and very natural, no synthetic fragrance either, which is very good as synthetic fragrance is harmful to the face. Thank you,</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Works great for stretch marks and wrinkles. Love the natural ingredients! I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> Great lotion for after shower use. The scent does take a little getting used to. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling on the skin. A little bit truly goes a long way. Kept my feet feeling hydrated all night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> This Whipped Shea Butter is great! It is so smooth, and really moisturizes all areas of my skin. I had a dry spot on my face that just wouldn&#x27;t go away and after just 2 days of applying this Whipped Shea Butter, the dry spot is gone! I also got a slight burn on my hand and immediately applied the Whipped Shea Butter and the burning stopped! I love the wide range of uses of this product and that it is fragrance free. I will definitely use this product forever!</li>
    <li> Got this a few days and tried on my heels, which are wicked dry and my chest scar.  Seemed to soften the area, but it was slightly greasy.  That&#x27;s why I gave it a 3 star.  Although, in the following days, my skin seemed to be softer than before.  I don&#x27;t like the dry skin that I have, but this seemed to help.</li>
    <li> I use shea butter for a lot of things. I make my own lotion bars and use straight shea as lotion in the winter. This particular shea butter seems oiler than what I&#x27;m used to and a very little bit goes a very long way. I think this might be due to the whipped factor. It&#x27;s a pretty big container and I won&#x27;t run out any time soon.</li>
    <li> I love this product for deep moisture. It is very good for dry skin. The moisture lasts until it is washed off</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of shea butter in general, I find it super thick and greasy, and not particularly effective. I kind of bought this product in the hopes that whipped shea butter would bring a new element to the equation, and I&#x27;m not disappointed. I&#x27;m not in love with it yet, but my skin does feel super soft after using it, and the oily residue went away within a few seconds, leaving moisturized, smooth skin behind. I&#x27;m going to use it on my stretch marks and I&#x27;ll update my review if I notice stellar results. I can see adding this to my daily regimen for soft skin on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I did anticipate &amp;#34;whipped shea butter&amp;#34; to be lighter and fluffier than it is, but it is considerably lighter than its non-whipped counterpart.</li>
    <li> great product, fast shipping. I&#x27;m very happy I placed my order with rise and shine through Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Shea Butter for the last month. It works great! I have sensitive dryish skin so am very picky about the creams that I use. It handled my dry skin almost immediately and made my skin feel very smooth! I also used it on a sun burn that my daughter had, it was gentle enough for her and handled it over night!&lt;br /&gt;It does not have much of a sent to it which I like because I am also sensitive to smells.  Goes on smoothly and then soaks into the skin nicely.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been over a month I have used this product and it&#x27;s has made my skin so smooth and soft especially my feet. I like it because it leaves a lasting moisture on my skin but it&#x27;s not greasy. I was expecting it to be a bit lighter because it&#x27;s whipped but I do realize it&#x27;s Shea butter. I would buy it again, I&#x27;m almost finished the jar.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Definitely worth it! My skin is sooo much smoother!</li>
    <li> ALL SHEA BUTTERS ARE NOT THE SAME!  This Shea Butter is organic, 100% pure and unrefined.  As such, it has retained all of the natural integrity unlike other Shea butters who have had fragrances or other ingredients added to it.  This jar is a big 16 ounces which is wonderful because this product is a staple in my home.  A fabulous moisturizer for every part of the body, a good remedy for burns, (including sun burns), insect bites; this product has so many uses I&#x27;m sure I have not found them all.  It can even be used on your hair, stretch marks and scars.  In my home I use it for all of the above but especially on my lips.  My lips are always getting dry and cracked - especially in the winter but unfortunately, it happens even in the summer.  If there is too much air conditioning, not enough moisture, etc.  Eh - who knows why?  I hate it because chapped lips are the precursor to cold sores and I truly despise those.  So Shea butter keeps me better moisturized than ANY lip product on the market.  NOTHING compares to Shea butter.  I use this big container and then reduce a small amount of it into a very small Tupperware container I own and that goes where I go.  That lip thing can happen anywhere so I&#x27;m prepared.  Seriously, this is an awesome product and the fact that it is a natural source of vitamin A, which is great for skin makes it perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One important thing to note:  1.  If you have a nut allergy, DO NOT use this product.  It contains a nut by-product!  I did receive this product on a promotion for purposes of evaluation and review.  This is my honest experience and opinion.  Shea Butter (100% pure, no additives) is a MUST for every home.</li>
    <li> I put this on the eczema I have been having on my wrist that is very dry and itchy and it soothes it immediately. It works great and is a very large container.</li>
    <li> I received this whipped pure raw African Shea Butter by Rise N&#x27; Shine Online. It was not what I expected, but in a GOOD way. This Shea butter is completely raw and natural with no fragrances or additives AT ALL. It is completely organic!  The jar is so light that I almost thought the jar was empty, but it was slam full and tight like you would expect of a butter. (that should tell you the quality of the whipping!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are so many uses for this butter! Being that it is unscented, it can be used by men and women of all ages. It has healing properties as well as moisturizing. It can be used to revitalize skin and hair, heal or lighten scars and stretch marks, its excellent for blemished skin. It can be used for eczema and dermatitis. It can help heal allergies, insect bites, frostbites. It is great during the summer time for sunburns! It helps with frostbite for our northern friends. This cream is safe for the entire body. My daughter licks her lips CONSTANTLY and usually ends up with red irritated lips and the surrounding skin of her lips. This has helped her when she is chapped or chafed from doing that. It is great to use on your face and I like to use it on my feet as well. (but I can be used on the entire body) It can even be used on dry, damaged hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes with a free e-book and a 30 day guarantee!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a week now and I have noticed the dryness of my hands and face is gone.  I have also been using it on my feet and they are softening up.  I would recommend this product to anyone who would like soft skin.</li>
    <li> I really like this.  It&#x27;s great for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is going to be quick... I love this!  I love the results from using Shea butter but I hate tryign to whip it my self..  By the time you mix it and strain it and so on you are tired and have spent a ton of time on a product you paid a good deal for.  This product is perfect I love it and will buy it over and over. It des not have the gritty feel that raw shea butter has.  It is a huge jar.  Just buy it it is awesome.  I received a discount on this product for an honest unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Whipped Shea Butter is great! Especially if you have dry skin.  It moisturizes your skin and makes your skin feels smooth. It&#x27;s unscented so you don&#x27;t have to be worried about the smell attracting bugs.  It&#x27;s made with natural ingredients. This has a wide variety of uses.  I used it on my face, elbows, knees, and feet.  All of those areas feel softer and smooth.  Especially my dry cracked feet. Can say that anymore.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product! My skin gets dry from my line of work and it helps keep me away from dry cracked skin. My wife also loves it and uses it every day. Her skin looks great! I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anybody.</li>
    <li> It says unscented, but it has a very strong order. Or mine did at least, however it feels great, and its not oily or greasy. I added some essential oils to it, so i can make some scented lotions, body butters. I also used it raw and added flavoring to make lip balms, it works very well for that. It absorbs into the skin very nicely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sample provided</li>
    <li> This product works miracles for my daughters excema!</li>
    <li> After using the product twice, I noticed a big difference with my calised hands.The dead skin that is unpleasant to to the touch have softened. It&#x27; s not greasy or does it leave a greasy film. I especially like the fragrant smell that is not over powering. I&#x27;d recommend whipped Shea butter to young and old. Whether your in construction or an office worker,doctor, lawyer,nurse, or even a student try it I urge you in order to find the same satisfaction I have found.&lt;br /&gt;Joseph Puggioni&lt;br /&gt;Warners, N.Y.</li>
    <li> I get dryness of my elbows and feet, so I need something that I can apply at night to keep the dryness from effecting my sleep at night. This works perfectly for me. It contains no petroleum products and has made a huge difference for my aging skin. A little bit goes a long way, so it is more than worth the price.</li>
    <li> I love it. Easy to work with. Smooth texture, melts easily by rubbing hands together. Keeps my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I bought this product mainly for my husband, who has skin problems. This product is 100% natural and organic and helps with many skin problems including but not limited to, blemishes, wrinkles due to dry skin,and replacing the moisture back in dry hair and skin. This Shea Butter comes in a very large size which should last for a very long time. I bought this product at a reduced price and this is mt honest opinion.</li>
    <li> It feels quite hard at first, but it starts smoothing out once you use it. At first, I thought that it was too greasy, but it evens out after a few minutes.</li>
    <li> Super awesome with whipped cream on top! I&#x27;m a body cream expert-from drugstore cheap to very high-end, I&#x27;ve tried them all. I bought this because I needed an organic, deep conditioning, overnight cream, especially for my feet and elbows. Well, this is gorgeous cream. The scent is pleasant-nutty but not overwhelmingly so. I have bought raw shea butter creams before and I had to throw them out because the scent was horrible. I can spread it on my skin without too much difficulty and the texture is wonderful as well. I can feel my skin saying, &amp;#34;ahhhhhhhhh, that&#x27;s nice!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much. A winner for sure. This is destined to become a staple in my ever-changing rotation of body creams. Thanks so much for offering this product. It really is amazing.</li>
    <li> This Shea butter is so soft and smooth. I love it!</li>
    <li> This is such great stuff. It&#x27;s a little dense and has to be warmed up in the hand, but it&#x27;s anti-inflammatory, non-comedogenic, and an outstanding moisturizer.  I had bug bites all over my neck and underarms and put this on and it immediately calmed the inflammation and made the bites stop itching. They have healed more quickly. It&#x27;s great on its own as a moisturizer and in combination with my regular moisturizers.  It plumps the skin and the skin looks great afterwards.  And it totally calmed my 4 year old&#x27;s red rash on his little rear, a result of a bout of diarrhea.  It&#x27;s an outstanding natural product and the care and customer service of this company is great.  It is so nice to find such a high quality product sold by people who believe in it and really care.  Plus my aesthetician said that shea is a very anti-aging product for the skin, especially as a body moisturizer.  I do love using it, my whole skin feels better.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Shea butter has so many uses but my main problem was finding pure shea butter that wasn&#x27;t solid. I order this whipped butter through a special deal to try it and share my honest and unbiased opinion. First pro I find, as I stated, this is a whipped butter so really easy to use, second it is pure shea butter and unrefined and it is natural. Another pro I find is that it is unscented and for me this is a big deal as I have allergies to strong smells. I&#x27;ve been using it on my heels and my cracks are noticeably getting smaller and my heels are getting soft. I also use as a general moisturizer for my hands and I love it.Great quality !</li>
    <li> THIS SHEA BUTTER IS the best I&#x27;ve ever purchased – hands down. I cannot believe how well it handles dry skin. I can use it anywhere - head to toe. My dry, cracked heels were smooth in days (I put it on every night before going to bed.) I even tried it as a hair-sculpting gel after reading another review. Worked great and conditioned my curls at the same time. Ingredients: top notch. Perfume-free (yes!). Smells great. I hear it works on sunburns too but I haven&#x27;t needed to try it for that yet. I do have a couple of old facial scars and it seems to be helping. Not too thick either. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product worked great on my skin. It made it feel like butta...  You will like this product. Plus it was at a good deal!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shipping was quick and would probably buy again!</li>
    <li> Very good quality product, and easy to apply. Works wonders on dry skin. I like the fact that it&#x27;s unscented so everyone in the house can use it without smelling like perfume. Has a clean, natural scent.</li>
    <li> This is a 16 oz jar of whipped pure raw African shea butter. I  bought this for use on my dry skin. The older I get, the drier my skin gets. I bought a block of Shea Butter last week and it smelled buttery, more like coco butter. This is  a thick butter that smells more like the plant than the cocoa smell a lot of butters have. It&#x27;s not bad smelling. It just took me by surprise. I think it would appeal more to someone who likes totally natural smells. Like leaves, brushes, sages, and other unsweetened aromas.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest using a tiny bit. It goes further than I expected. When I opened it, I scooped about a nickel sized amount on my finger and it was enough to do both arms. I would recommend using less the first time, in order to get use to the smell. I don’t mind the smell.  I get monthly fair trade product subscriptions and get products from all over the world. There are vegan products, superfood snacks, etc. that have have tastes and smells my other family members don’t like, but I am fine with. I happen to like products with less perfumes  dyes, etc.&lt;br /&gt; It moisturizes  very well. I think it would be good for use in the shower, right before you dry off, in order to hold in moisture. Since it is a naturally unscented, I&#x27;m going to play around with it and mix it with some beeswax,  coconut oil, and essential oils to create an entirely unique body butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER:&lt;br /&gt;MY No Nonsense Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt; I could copy the description or retell you that you have already read in the description, But you&#x27;ve already read it.

    <li> Whipped Shea butter is different from other unrefined Shea butters, whipped Shea butter is creamy, soft and smooth.  My body and hair has noticed a remarkable and enjoyable difference great.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for do many uses. Very happy with it for my family.</li>
    <li> Very great ready to use shea butter.  We have used this on our arms and hands and knees with great results.  It seems to lock in the moisture and should do great during the winter months.  It comes out of the jar a bit on the thick side but it softens up with little friction from your hands.</li>
    <li> This is whipped so it&#x27;s light. It has a very light smell too. Non-greasy... Long lasting. Really glad that I came across it.</li>
    <li> Unplesant smell.  Liquified in the heat .  Not suitable for use. How in the world did this get so many stars?  I sent it back the first time and they sent another.  That one opened in the package and leaked out into the zip lock bag.  It was NOT fit to use!</li>
    <li> Excellent for hair and skin!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product on special discount and Ive absolutely fell in love with it!</li>
    <li> This Shea butter is the real deal. It takes some warming by rubbing your hands together, but then it melts into your skin. I may try warming it in a dish over hot water, too. It is high quality, and I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> It does not have a smell which freaks me out and It kind of feels like putting Crisco on your body. It does help smooth rough parts like knees, elbows, heels, etc. Really thick. Not what I was expecting but on good side it moisturized my rough spots. I just did not like the oily feel.</li>
    <li> Customer service is amazing. The first didn&#x27;t arrive and they responded promptly and took care of the problem. I was so happy that they did because this product is amazing. Using I buy blocks of Raw Shea Butter and have to melt it down and whip it to get it soft enough for daily use. This product is is easy to use right of the jar. I have very dry skin and just a few scoops of this Shea Butter moisturizes my entire body. I have natural hair so I use this on my hair as well. It moisturizes my curls and leaves my hair so soft. I will continue to keep ordering this product because it works and saves me times.</li>
    <li> Got this product at an amazing price I&#x27;m actually in love with this stuff I started using it in my heels and on my girls knees it feels wonderful are roughness is now soft</li>
    <li> The whipped Shea butter arrived as promised. I used this Shea butter recently, and find it extremely useful for a number of purposes. After I wash my hair, I apply a small amount of Shea butter all over my hair. The whipped Shea butter is much easier to take out of the jar and spread on my hair and skin (I also apply a small amount of coconut oil as well.) The whipped Shea butter smooths very easily onto my itchy (caused by eczema) skin for some relief from the itchy discomfort.</li>
    <li> This product has made quite a difference on my cracked heels after only a few days of use.  It is too soon to tell how it works on scars (from foot surgery), but I am hopeful! Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product, excellent for dry skin and for scars as well</li>
    <li> I got this today and was surprised that it was so light. When I opened it it is actually much thicker than I thought it would be. It doesn&#x27;t have any odor or fragrance which is great and it doesn&#x27;t leave the skin oily. It seeps right in and leaves my skin soft and smooth. I&#x27;m hoping it will help clean up a dry skin issue I have but I only just got it today.</li>
    <li> I work in the construction field.  I use this on my feet, knees and elbows at night.  They feel much softer and a lot less sand paper like.  I recommend this to all MEN and WOMEN.</li>
    <li> Sorry to say I didn&#x27;t like this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a scent which some people I&#x27;m sure would appreciate but it doesn&#x27;t smell good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was kinda of cheap and looks kind of tacky to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works like any other shea butter, greasy and takes a bit of time to actually soak into the skin. This one is a bit more thick compared to others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t totally not recommend this product but I&#x27;m not a huge fan. It could be good for winter when the weather is harsher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main problem is the smell and thickness</li>
    <li> So good! Very high quality shea butter, it is nice to finally find a shea butter product that actually glides on smoothly and easily, and and that is truly moisturizing and healing. Will definitely buy again, and again!</li>
    <li> Good product and customer service too.</li>
    <li> very thick - I think the winter time will be better for me to use this. The jar doesn&#x27;t feel like there is much substance in it, very deceiving because there&#x27;s a lot of thick, thick butter in it.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  These folks know what they are doing.  This is a huge jar of pure shea butter cream!  I love that it is  100 natural, organic grade, moisture for soft skin.  I&#x27;ve tried it on my hair too and I love the results! My grandkids use it on their blemishes,  I use it on my scar from stomach surgery and have seen improvement on the appearance.  I have noticed a marked difference in the appearance of fine lines around my mouth and eyes.  It comes with a  free e-book too.  I really am pleased with the results I&#x27;ve seen so far and would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is probably a great product but the first jar came as liquid so they were kind enough to send me a second jar, liquid again. Maybe it doesn&#x27;t hold up well in the heat I live in Arizona</li>
    <li> Love this! Use on my face day and night-best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Very smooth Shea Butter.  Rubs in well, not very greasy as some can be.  Soaks into skin nicely and smells great.  Recommend it to anyone looking for a large amount of Shea Butter, Great amount for the price.  Whipped nicely and easily absorbed.</li>
    <li> I brought this product for my best friend. She uses the Whipped Shea butter on her hair and skin. She loves this product every time I see her she raves about this product and thanks me a thousand times.&lt;br /&gt;this product smells good, it&#x27;s creamy and it does every thing you advertised it did.</li>
    <li> I love this product this is pure unadulterated shea butter, and it has an incredibly smooth consistency. I am so impressed, because normally shea butter is super hard, but this whipped version just glides on your skin. Very satisfied customer, I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I use this for my hair and dry skin. It is super moisturizing for my hair. I love the feel of the whipped butter in my hair, it isn&#x27;t greasy as so many others have been and the way it works on dry skin is amazing! You really have to feel and use this for your self to see how great it works. I am going to start using it on a surgical scar and will update on that later. I received a discount on this product for a review.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely loving the Whipped Shea Butter.  The first picture of my hand is right after applying the shea butter. The second picture is about 3 minutes later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 16oz jar will last an incredibly long time. A little goes a really long way. You do not need much of this to get a lasting effect. While it is greasy upon application, the butter soaks into your skin within about 3 minutes and leaves your skin soft and dry, unlike chemically made moisturizers that leave you feeling greasy for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The butter is hard like a crsico. It is not something you can just dip your finger in. While it is light and airy from being whipped, it does require you to pull the moisturizer out by swiping your finger across it. As you do this, you will notice the moisturizer rolls behind your finger. It is thick when applying, slightly sticky, but as it rubs in, it melts like a butter. Just don&#x27;t put this on your pancakes. Its not for human or any animals consumption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is naturally unscented, but does have a slight nutty smell. It is a but by-product, so if you have allergies towards nuts, this is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this mainly with a little jojoba oil for an intense moisturizer that really assists in healing my dry and cracked skin, but it can be used for other things like soothing sunburns and reducing unsightly scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great alternative to chemically filled moisturizers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given the opportunity to test it out at a deeply discounted rate in order to give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!!! Shea butter is great for many many things... Smell is wonderful as well HIGHLY recoomend</li>
    <li> I started using this 2 weeks ago and it&#x27;s now my favorite product. I use it after showering before bed on my face and hair, and the next day my skin and hair have great natural moisture. I can already see less wrinkling. This will last you quite a few months as I&#x27;m barely making a dent on the quantity that came in the container. I&#x27;m very glad to have found the only product I need in such a healthy form and at such a great price. Thank you for this product!</li>
    <li> This Shea butter was just what I needed working out west in the dryer climates. It only takes a few days for your skin to start really drying out.  This keeps it moist so it stops hurting or cracking as dry skin often does.  KK6J7-2149</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! Love the natural ingredients, and use it daily for me and my one year old daughter.</li>
    <li> I have always loved plain raw shea butter, but had never tried a whipped version.  Applying this was a million times easier than plain raw shea butter.  Normally, I don&#x27;t like using shea butter on parts of my body that clothing will cover because I&#x27;m afraid some grease will get on to my clothing.  It was not the case at all with this product, which makes it a great option for my legs and arms. I am pleased to have received this product as a discounted price. My experience has been positive and I will continue to use it for sure.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:b1d41b7e3363269622df764e30024c56]]This review is for the Rise N Shine Online 16 Oz Whipped Pure Raw African Shea Butter Cream. This is THICK, luscious shea butter packed into a jar. This shea butter is absolutely, INCREDIBLY moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received this container I was a little confused how thick the butter was. But then I dug some out and started spreading and realized how wonderful this product is. It goes on super smooth and leaves skin feeling fresh and softer then you have ever experienced. I was obsessed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started putting this on the heels of my feet every night. I would spread it thick and cover my feet with black cotton socks and leave them on all night. In the morning my feet looked so great I had never seen them like that! I wear sandals almost every day (I live in sunny California) and my feel take a beating. This product has changed my life in the fact that I am no longer embarrassed if someone looks close up at my toes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally wish this product was scented, so I changed that myself. I mix a little bit with organic essential oils and it creates a wonderful therapeutic, scented product which I enjoy. If you put your nose RIGHT NEXT to the butter you can smell a very faint earthy smell. That is why I prefer to scent it myself with the oils. This product would be great for males who hate all those girly scented lotions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5 stars for value of container, ingredients and results! If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer! Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discounted sample for my honest and unbiased review, all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This shea butter is very moisturizing.  Just one point to know, it is fairly solid - not a negative just something I didn&#x27;t realize when buying.</li>
    <li> Good things don&#x27;t have to smell or look perfect. Got it couple of days back but believe it or not, my face already seemed to have healed from pigmentation and toned for good.&lt;br /&gt;When I received it, the seal was opened a bit and the top layer looked hard. So I wrote a mail and it was because of the heat in CA and they assured that the product is new and totally fine. So here I am reviewing it.</li>
    <li> Great product! Nice to find something that is all natural. My skin feels amazing after just one use. You only need to use a small amount each time so it will last a long time. Very happy with my purchase. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Hmmmm what can you do with Whipped Shea Butter......EVERYTHING!!!!! This stuff smells great and a little goes along way. I use it on my skin and hair and to me it works wonders and I&#x27;m positive it will for you.</li>
    <li> It was already opened.  Half of it already spilled out. Smells awful and rancid.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to see shea butter that had already been whipped! I perfer whipped shea butter because of how light and airy it is. In this state the butter is easily absorbed and easier to apply. I may even add some fragrance oil as this is unscented. After I use about half, I will add a fragrance oil and fold it in to perserve the airy texture.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like it. All natural, great size and price, but nope. I thought whipped would mean it&#x27;s light and easily spreadable, but it does not spread like a cream at all. It very hard like a butter and you have to get huge chunks to cover a large area of the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s probably something I could deal with, but then the butter itself leaves you so greasy! I am literally glistening after rubbing this in, and everything I touch leaves an oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves you sticky, and hair and just about everything gets stuck to my skin. Ewie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see how anyone can wear this comfortably as its so heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not for me as I like my skin to absorb a cream, not have it be hanging out on me all day like an oil slick.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!  I love how it feels when I put it on, and it has been helping my skin look and feel hydrated and more youthful!</li>
    <li> This is a nice light shea butter/lotion that feels great on my dry-prone skin. I&#x27;ve never been a fan of Shea because of how thick it is, but whipping it seems to be the trick and this is the product. I believe in the healing qualities of shea so it&#x27;s great to find a workable way to use it. It has helped my dry winter legs so much after a week of using it. I also don&#x27;t love the smell of Shea in general, but this one is not overwhelming like some can be and didn&#x27;t bother me at all</li>
    <li> amazing. we use this for everything</li>
    <li> well i received it half weight it&#x27;s really shocking , am so upset</li>
</ol>
