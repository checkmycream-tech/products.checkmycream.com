      <li>I just want others to be safe.</li>
      <li>glad it&#x27;s worked so well for others.</li>
      <li>I would like to try more of their skin care.</li>
      <li>This stuff goes on nicely and makes the area smooth.  </li>
      <li>I guess I was expecting more results.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe Amazon carries it at such a great price too!</li>
      <li>Overall a very good cream, I will be a repeat buyer.  </li>
      <li>When I used up the sample I was given, I immediately ordered the full tube!</li>
      <li>Received this product very quickly.  </li>
      <li>Arrived quickly also!</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly though.</li>
      <li>Works great, skin instantly feels tighter.</li>
      <li>I recommend it for a smooth finish when using foundation or concealer under your eyes, and not wanting to look cake-y or powdery coated.</li>
      <li>pretty good--still searching for something better for eye puffs.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see a significant difference in the appearance of my eyes.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly and is non greasy.</li>
      <li>Nothing special</li>
      <li>Glad to try it at a reasonable price, but would not repurchase.</li>
      <li>It works great in the morning due to ingredients that help with ridding you of that morning puffiness (caffeine is one for example) but is</li>
      <li>It is a thick cream, it feels good to apply it under my eyes, but don&#x27;t expect something spectacular.</li>
      <li>I really like the Bareminerals/Escentual product lines, and this eye cream feels light but still keeps my eye area comfortably moisturized all day.</li>
      <li>Fortunately I found the first one before applying it to my eye area but they keep coming.  </li>
      <li>, MY EYES ARE SO SENSITIVE, I HAVE BEEN USING FOR 2 WEEKS, AND SO FAR SO GOOD.......</li>
      <li>I have tried so many eye creams from expensive to drugstore brands and this is by far the best!</li>
      <li>Love Bare Minerals.  </li>
      <li>Was very hopeful this product would live up to the many positive reviews.</li>
      <li>I love this eye cream, I only use it in the morning</li>
      <li>Although this is not my primary &amp;#34;Skin care moisturizer&amp;#34; ...I have used this product under my make up application and then a few dabs on top post makeup.  </li>
      <li>Like all Bare Mineral products, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
      <li>I am greatly disturbed by this and wanted to warn other potential purchasers.  </li>
      <li>It has a little bit of a tint to it, which is nice because I have darker circles under my eyes.  </li>
      <li>also is gentle on the skin,</li>
      <li>i HAVE REALLY BAGGY EYES AND</li>
      <li>It works great on puffy, tired eyes</li>
      <li>Have to admit that I really didn&#x27;t see any changes with this product.  </li>
      <li>The shipping was fast, the eye cream works very&lt;</li>
      <li>if I put too much on.</li>
      <li>THIS REALLY DOES WHAT IT SAYS IT WILL DO</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>I feel that BareMinersl firming eye treatment wasn&#x27;t any better than some other brands that I have bought.  </li>
      <li>Firstly, I&#x27;ve been using this product for several weeks and see no improvement to my eye area at all.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think they look any firmer or have less fine lines.</li>
      <li>WOW</li>
      <li>I am in my 60s and these completely toned and firmed the area around my eyes.</li>
      <li>for sensitive skin, soothing to the eye area,&lt;br /&gt;anti aging benifits.  </li>
      <li>but I like the way it makes my skin under my eyes soft and it it stays on all night.</li>
      <li>Keeps my eye area moisturized and soft.</li>

<li> I feel that BareMinersl firming eye treatment wasn&#x27;t any better than some other brands that I have bought.  </li>
<li> Firstly, I&#x27;ve been using this product for several weeks and see no improvement to my eye area at all.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think they look any firmer or have less fine lines.</li>
<li> WOW</li>

<li> Keeps my eye area moisturized and soft.</li>
<li> I have rarely re purchased the same moisturizers for a second time.</li>
<li> (I have natural dark circles)</li>
<li> I have very sensitive skin around my eyes, and have trouble finding products that are recommended for eyes that I can tolerate.</li>
<li> I have nothing negative to say about this product: it&#x27;s all positive.</li>
<li> I bought Bare Minerals Firming Eye Treatment because I use all of their other products</li>
<li> Each tube lasts a long time too!  </li>
<li> I have tried several around the eye products to get the bags down.  </li>
<li> I like the Bare Minerals line, but unfortunately this cream really did nothing for my eyes.</li>
<li> I can tell it really hydrates the delicate skin under the eyes!</li>
<li> I cannot believe that I spent $$ and time on this tube of eye cream that does not make a difference.</li>
<li> Only been using a few days</li>
<li> A LITTLE OF THIS CREAM GOES A LONG WAY.</li>
<li> I can only hope that the actual product itself is better than the horrible job the sender did mailing this to me.</li>
<li> It defntly helps with the dark circles under your eyes!</li>
<li> Within a few days.</li>
<li> Works within a few days for me</li>
<li> It actually does lubricate and firm the eye area without going all greasy or irritating the eyes themselves.  </li>
<li> no to very little effect on that</li>
<li> When I opened up the small thin envelope in which it was mailed, the cardboard container in which the product was packaged was crushed.</li>
<li> There is no tint whatsoever, so I&#x27;m not sure why the Amazon review page asked me how the color is.</li>
<li> but that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m lazy at night.</li>
<li> I use this everyday!</li>
<li> eyes are usually puffy in the morning with bags below my eyes.</li>
<li> Not sure if it&#x27;s helping with wrinkles.</li>
<li> Effectiveness is subtle but there.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a very thick, creamy consistency which doesn&#x27;t work well under</li>
<li> Besides being delivered after the promised delivery date, the item was poorly packaged.</li>
<li> I find it very expensive, and I am not sure if I will buy it again.</li>
<li> This is the only one that worked for me and does not release something awful into my eyes to irritate them.  </li>
<li> This was especially irritating since it was purchased as a gift and now looks like a hand-me-down defective item.</li>

    <li> I have tried several around the eye products to get the bags down.  This is the only one that worked for me and does not release something awful into my eyes to irritate them.  I am in my 60s and these completely toned and firmed the area around my eyes.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for several years.  Not greasy or oily.  Like bareMinerals products.  Would recommend this product.  Received this product very quickly.  Within a few days.</li>
    <li> good product as always</li>
    <li> I feel that BareMinersl firming eye treatment wasn&#x27;t any better than some other brands that I have bought.  I guess I was expecting more results.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing eye cream. It works great in the morning due to ingredients that help with ridding you of that morning puffiness (caffeine is one for example) but is also is gentle on the skin, something that I wasn&#x27;t expecting. I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Like all Bare Mineral products, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> I bought Bare Minerals Firming Eye Treatment because I use all of their other products and I am basically very happy with them.  I have two reasons for the one star rating here.  Firstly, I&#x27;ve been using this product for several weeks and see no improvement to my eye area at all.  Secondly, during the second week of using this product I began to find pointy shards of plastic coming out in the cream.  Fortunately I found the first one before applying it to my eye area but they keep coming.  I am greatly disturbed by this and wanted to warn other potential purchasers.  I plan on contacting the company about this and returning the tube.  I don&#x27;t care about a refund I just want others to be safe.</li>
    <li> BareMinerals turns out a quality product.  It actually does lubricate and firm the eye area without going all greasy or irritating the eyes themselves.  I have nothing negative to say about this product: it&#x27;s all positive.</li>
    <li> I like the Bare Minerals line, but unfortunately this cream really did nothing for my eyes. I got the same results with $8 drugstore cream.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream, I only use it in the morning but that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m lazy at night. There is no tint whatsoever, so I&#x27;m not sure why the Amazon review page asked me how the color is. I really like the Bareminerals/Escentual product lines, and this eye cream feels light but still keeps my eye area comfortably moisturized all day.</li>
    <li> WOW THIS REALLY DOES WHAT IT SAYS IT WILL DO....i HAVE REALLY BAGGY EYES AND A LITTLE OF THIS CREAM GOES A LONG WAY.</li>
    <li> Besides being delivered after the promised delivery date, the item was poorly packaged. When I opened up the small thin envelope in which it was mailed, the cardboard container in which the product was packaged was crushed. This was especially irritating since it was purchased as a gift and now looks like a hand-me-down defective item. I can only hope that the actual product itself is better than the horrible job the sender did mailing this to me. I would advise others to avoid buying products from this company.</li>
    <li> Keeps my eye area moisturized and soft. Not sure if it&#x27;s helping with wrinkles. Sometimes it will make my eyes water or itch at bed time if I put too much on.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many eye creams from expensive to drugstore brands and this is by far the best! I have actually seen results in the short time I&#x27;ve been using it and will never be without it!!</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream! It works great on puffy, tired eyes (: I would like to try more of their skin care. I already use the make-up &amp; like it...</li>
    <li> Only been using a few days but I like the way it makes my skin under my eyes soft and it it stays on all night. It rubs in nicely. Can&#x27;t wait to see what happens with continued use.</li>
    <li> This gives my eye area a moe youthful appearance. I have very sensitive skin around my eyes, and have trouble finding products that are recommended for eyes that I can tolerate. This is definitely a keeper.</li>
    <li> Overall a very good cream, I will be a repeat buyer.  It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly and is non greasy. Effectiveness is subtle but there.</li>
    <li> Have to admit that I really didn&#x27;t see any changes with this product.  Glad to try it at a reasonable price, but would not repurchase.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years.  A great product that does what it should.</li>
    <li> Works great, skin instantly feels tighter. I have tried many products for puffy eyes. (I have natural dark circles) This one so far is the best I have tried. I can&#x27;t believe Amazon carries it at such a great price too!</li>
    <li> This product works great!!! Fast and awesome service!!!</li>
    <li> pretty good--still searching for something better for eye puffs. any suggestion out there?</li>
    <li> EVERYTHING BREAKS MY EYES OUT, MY EYES ARE SO SENSITIVE, I HAVE BEEN USING FOR 2 WEEKS, AND SO FAR SO GOOD.......</li>
    <li> Was very hopeful this product would live up to the many positive reviews. Haven&#x27;t seen any&lt;br /&gt;improvement at all. It&#x27;s a very thick, creamy consistency which doesn&#x27;t work well under&lt;br /&gt;eye makeup. As a moisturizer, it works ok.&lt;br /&gt;My eyes are usually puffy in the morning with bags below my eyes. This product&lt;br /&gt;had no to very little effect on that which was my number one reason for trying it.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this from a vendor through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s worked so well for others. Guess I&#x27;ll just keep hunting for one that helps me.</li>
    <li> I think  it helps with the morning puffiness of my eyes. It is a thick cream, it feels good to apply it under my eyes, but don&#x27;t expect something spectacular. I find it very expensive, and I am not sure if I will buy it again. Still, I think it does a good/okay job.</li>
    <li> This product met all expectations! I would recommend it and I will purchase again! Arrived quickly also! It makes a difference in the eye area.</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast, the eye cream works very&lt;br /&gt;well for sensitive skin, soothing to the eye area,&lt;br /&gt;anti aging benifits.  Love Bare Minerals.  Good&lt;br /&gt;price too.</li>
    <li> Although this is not my primary &amp;#34;Skin care moisturizer&amp;#34; ...I have used this product under my make up application and then a few dabs on top post makeup.  I like the results! I have rarely re purchased the same moisturizers for a second time. But I&#x27;ve been using this for over 6 years now!  Each tube lasts a long time too!  I recommend it for a smooth finish when using foundation or concealer under your eyes, and not wanting to look cake-y or powdery coated.</li>
    <li> This stuff goes on nicely and makes the area smooth.  It has a little bit of a tint to it, which is nice because I have darker circles under my eyes.  Perfect for what I need!</li>
    <li> ok product. Nothing special</li>
    <li> I cannot believe that I spent $$ and time on this tube of eye cream that does not make a difference.</li>
    <li> I received this on time, but directions say it takes several weeks to tell a difference...so I can&#x27;t comment yet on effectiveness.  It goes on smoothly though.</li>
    <li> It defntly helps with the dark circles under your eyes! Love this product!! Works within a few days for me</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see a significant difference in the appearance of my eyes. I don&#x27;t think they look any firmer or have less fine lines. I got this product about 3 months ago and still have plenty of product in the tube, I will continue to use it until I run out but I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday! it works so well even my husband uses it when his eyes are puffy!!!  I even use above my upper lips.. wrinkles gone!! love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This firming eye cream is wonderful! I can tell it really hydrates the delicate skin under the eyes! When I used up the sample I was given, I immediately ordered the full tube!</li>
    <li> this is a very good product, I  sometimes combine it with Royal jelly eye cream ( Burt&#x27;s Bees) to provide additional  benefits.</li>
