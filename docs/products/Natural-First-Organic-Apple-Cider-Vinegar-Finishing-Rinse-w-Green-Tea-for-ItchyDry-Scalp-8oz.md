      <li>Worth a try!</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s good to lean your head back in the shower) and</li>

      <li>If you wish to use this sort of rinse, and smell funny, grab your jug of apple cider vinegar and use it straight up, or mix with water.</li>
      <li>Repect the end result of pure holistics</li>
      <li>really can not tell the difference</li>
      <li>It really felt like it got rid of the chemical gunk I had accumulated in my hair for all these years.</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>Works very well.  </li>

      <li>Bought this rinse because I live in the Northeast</li>
      <li>It makes my hair feel very soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>It can do so much to help you and this product is no different.</li>
      <li>I do like that its 100% natural ingredients though.</li>
      <li>Completely got rid of the itchy/dry feeling as soon as I started using it.</li>
      <li>Recommend Yves Rocher hair vinegar, which is pricey and harder to get, but, worth it.  </li>
      <li>It will dry down ok</li>
      <li>After shampoo, i put this on, leave it while i do other things, then rinse it really well and put conditioner on.</li>
      <li>Imagine working in a building with a few hundred others on a hot day, you sweat and it&#x27;s &amp;#</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I can definitely see and feel a difference in the softness of my hair after using this product. I use it about twice a week as a rinse between shampooing and conditioning.</li>
    <li> Years of using chemical and synthetic-based products on my hair left it pretty dull and lifeless over time. I am so glad I switched to natural products for my overall lifestyle as well as hair care routine. This finishing rinse made my hair way more manageable, and easier to comb. After I dried it the first time I could already notice more body and shine to it. It really felt like it got rid of the chemical gunk I had accumulated in my hair for all these years. A nice plus is the aroma which is pretty pleasant. Very satisfied, will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this conditioner. I have really thick dry hair and this has been a miracle conditioner for me. Not only does it work amazingly but it smells soo good! Love it!</li>
    <li> Look up how to make ur own.  U get more and is a lot cheaper.  If u don&#x27;t want to make ur own, this product will work for u though.</li>
    <li> really can not tell the difference</li>
    <li> I truly love this shampoo!  I have tried just about everything to cure my dry scalp and dandruff issues.  I use this shampoo after leaving coconut oil in my hair for about an hour before shampooing, and the results are spectacular.  Rinses out easy (careful, it stings the eyes so it&#x27;s good to lean your head back in the shower) and the smell does not linger.  It does smell like apple cider vinegar, but keeps my hair clean and soft for days.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Too runny. Didn&#x27;t work for me. Tried using as directed for a couple days, then tried using much more to see if that would help, which it seemed to slightly help but still not as good as another product I&#x27;ve used before- unfortunately that one is more expensive but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Worked wonders in the winter.  Had a very dry scalp due to the dry air.  Did a great job moisturizing my scalp as well as getting rid of any product residue.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do much for my hair and scalp, so I am not saying its bad, just that it wasn&#x27;t for me after a weeks worth of use. I do like that its 100% natural ingredients though.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair feel very soft and manageable. The scalp itching has subsided. Not sure yet how much it is going to help my hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;However, my scalp is much healthier! I plan to continue using this product long term in order to maintain a healthy scalp and hair.</li>
    <li> Had itchy dry scalp in the winter.  This cured that within a week of use.  Cant beat this product!</li>
    <li> Works very well. Nice smell.</li>
    <li> Once again Apple cider vinegar does it again. I&#x27;m telling you - you other customers. You can never go wrong with Apple cider vinegar. It can do so much to help you and this product is no different. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> Used $35 rinces in the past. This brand is half thr price, and just as high quality, if not better.</li>
    <li> I use this one-two times a week for my scalp. I try to use only organic products for my hair but I was worried if it would leave some vinegar scent but after first time using it I never worry about it again. My scalp feels cleansed after using this. After shampoo, i put this on, leave it while i do other things, then rinse it really well and put conditioner on. Worth a try!</li>
    <li> Worthy of leaving aside all itchy and unhealthy hair forever! The toner of lifless hair managment is here and truly remarkable to ty at home with conveniance and enjoyment. Just dont get bother by the tiny aroma still present by the vinegar.  Ita going to leave your hair beautiful and smelling good. Repect the end result of pure holistics</li>
    <li> Itchy scalp was always a huge humbug for me, And at the most inappropriate times I would get that uncontrollable urge to scratch my scalp.  I tried this product and since then I no longer have an itchy scalp.  That is a welcome relief for me.  It helps keep my hair with a nice sheen while it helped me rid myself of the urge to itch my scalp.  Two thumbs up to on this product.  Glad to have it.  Wish I had it many years ago.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  But, burned the hell out of my eyes.  Hard to use.  Recommend Yves Rocher hair vinegar, which is pricey and harder to get, but, worth it.  It doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes and smells like raspberries.  Going back to Yves Rocher.</li>
    <li> Do you want to smell like a pickle? If I could I&#x27;d give this no stars. If you wish to use this sort of rinse, and smell funny, grab your jug of apple cider vinegar and use it straight up, or mix with water. No need to waste your hard earned money on this stuff. It will dry down ok but once you break a sweat it&#x27;s all over. Imagine working in a building with a few hundred others on a hot day, you sweat and it&#x27;s &amp;#34;What&#x27;s that smell&amp;#34; all around you. It&#x27;s your hair stinking up the office. Product smooths cuticle, but holy Mary, this was poured down the drain. Never again.</li>
    <li> Bought this rinse because I live in the Northeast and it&#x27;s getting to be very cold and the air is getting very dry. I got this to help reinvigorate my scalp after being outside for so long. Completely got rid of the itchy/dry feeling as soon as I started using it. I&#x27;m going to use it year round from now on.</li>
