<li> In Which Nursing Home Do You Live?  </li>
<li> Have some self respect, my friend; whatever your age, you are too young for this aroma...</li>
<li> Angel Perfume reeks of chocolate-scented bathroom air freshener &amp; some kind of orthopedic shoe powder with a Godforsaken undercurrent of nursing home pastries.  </li>
<li> It was a little disappointing because I originally purchased it for the style of the bottle and scent.</li>
<li> this fragrance is impossible to find but I always find it on Amazon</li>

I&#x27;d recommend Innocent for daytime wear, and Angel for evening wear. I am Thierry Mugler&#x27;s fan forever. Both perfumes are very unique, and UNLIKE any other perfume I had ever smelled.

    <li> The scent is the same but the style of the bottle has changed. It was a little disappointing because I originally purchased it for the style of the bottle and scent.</li>
    <li> The ladies love this stuff! It&#x27;s elegant and classy and every woman in your life will want a bottle! It&#x27;s not expensive either, so that&#x27;s always a plus!+++</li>
    <li> The fragrance of &amp;#34;Innocent&amp;#34; is wonderful, not too strong like &amp;#34;Angel&amp;#34;.  Just wish the staying power was longer!!</li>
    <li> I got angel for my wife  and she love it so much that i will buy her some more in the furter i really like it on her</li>
    <li> After browsing for this perfume I pressed by mistake the click/order prompt instead of basket prompt so I could view this product and delivery address, I did not even have to log into my amazon account it just did an order and took payment from my bank,  no order confirmed by myself so all beware of this prompt !! Because of this the item was £20.39  &amp; SHIPPING costs £34.93,  but  the larger bottle of this fragrance 2.6oz  is shown as $92.09  &amp;shipping is $5.70.  How come? I am at present in touch with amazon who cannot help right now as item not delivered yet</li>
    <li> The price was right and I enjoy this fragrance so much, I thought I would treat myself.  It&#x27;s a wonderful light fragrance.</li>
    <li> smell as a real Innocent Angel, but it is not ear de perfume, it is water -water watering ear de toilette,&lt;br /&gt;real Angel Innocent smells all day long, upset, about this purchase</li>
    <li> My favorite eau the parfum</li>
    <li> Angel Innocent is a truly wonderful scent.  A bit sexy, a bit soft, and very feminine.  There is simply nothing else like it! Love love love this fragrence.</li>
