### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>great product.</li>
      <li>, This item is great, because you an press a button to turn it on.</li>
      <li>is now on its way out and greatly reduced.</li>
      <li>So willing to try anything, I bought this, and hoped for the best.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d been impressed with the effectiveness of my Zeno Hot Spot until it fizzled out.</li>
      <li>What kind of product would stop working after two weeks?</li>
      <li>idk to be honest</li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know how effective this product is.</li>
      <li>Works great if you have mild blemishes.</li>
      <li>It has also lost some of its sensitivity - it is supposed to start up when touching the skin, but it now requires pressing onto the skin.</li>
      <li>love it does everything it says it does</li>
      <li>Much better than the one that requires a change of batteries every 100 uses.  </li>
      <li>I love it, but the lack of longevity is a bummer.</li>
      <li>This product works really well, within 2-3 applications the zit is gone, its a good preventer.  </li>
      <li>So this would be worth its weight in gold!</li>
      <li>I had two of the original Tanda zap.</li>
      <li>It kills regular zits easily and the monster zits are better than they would have been.</li>
      <li>Luckily, I didn&#x27;t pay too much for the original Tanda Zap.</li>
      <li>In all 4 cases, I used it IMMEDIATELY as soon as I noticed that little &amp;#34;bump&amp;#34; starting to form under the surface, so I can&#x27;t say how effective it would be on existing pimples, but from my experience if you catch it right away, this thing will indeed prevent those tiny bumps from emerging into full blown pimples, and I am really happy I took a chance on this gadget!</li>
      <li>as it was the first time bought something</li>
      <li>We have tried so many different things to help her.</li>
      <li>love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to constantly replace the AAA batteries..</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s very time consuming.</li>
      <li>abroad!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s shipped VERY FAST.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>product really works, I just don&#x27;t give a 5 star concept &#x27;cause</li>
      <li>THIS IS SO MUCH</li>
      <li>I also had the replaceable battery powered one and that lasted much longer than this one.</li>
      <li>I am always quite skeptical about gadgets like this, but I am happy to report that this thing really does seem to work!</li>
      <li>Personally, it doesn&#x27;t work for whitehead or blackhead but works better for swollen and red acnes.</li>
      <li>how could such a tiny light help so much.</li>
      <li>It grinds and vibrates slowly or not at all, even when fully charged.</li>
      <li>After about 8 weeks of minimal use, this one has already lost its capacity to run at full power.</li>
      <li>They really do affect my life as I feel very self conscious about them, and they take so long to go away</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it religiously 3 times a day on certain break-outs and it seems to have minimized them</li>
      <li>1 about mid-way through (just starting to see it and very red/painful), and 1 that&#x27;s about a week old</li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s really used 3x in a day, the pimple will be gone the next day.  </li>
      <li>the original zap, where it had batteries and the number one complaint was that it ran through them quickly, mine keeps its charge for a long time, I charge it about once a week, and then just plug it in.  </li>
      <li>The blue light comes on with a slight warmth and vibration.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen major improvement.</li>
      <li>I should have dug further into researching this product, I think it does help though I don&#x27;t see a significant change in 24 hours other than it doesn&#x27;t grow bigger.</li>
      <li>Because the few of those that are left are so much more expensive than they were originally, I decided I&#x27;d have to use another device and opted for the Tanda Power Zap.</li>
      <li>I used the Tanda Zap 3 times yesterday for the first time on each one, and when I woke up this morning, the new pimple had pretty much gone, the 2nd one hadn&#x27;t progressed and was no longer red or painful, and the biggest one had been bought to a head so</li>

<li> The problem is, it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
<li> I have had it for about 2 months, during which I have used it 4 times, and every time the zit vanished after just one or two &amp;#34;treatments&amp;#34; (which is simply turning it on and holding it with the light against your skin for a few minutes; there is NO pain, NO heat or anything discernible that you can feel; it&#x27;s just like holding a small flashlight against your face for a little while).</li>
<li> The charge on it lasts a long time.  </li>
<li> Definitely slows down growth and minimizes acne size.</li>
<li> I usually get a few blemishes throughout the week, but I haven&#x27;t had one so far for an entire week.  </li>
<li> The dermatologist said to follow this treatment with salicylic acid 2% the next day to help get rid of the dead skin cells for a quicker clearing, and to erase any coloration from the pimple.</li>
<li> but others, it had absolutely no effect from what I can see.</li>
<li> that is huge, painful and extremely noticeable.</li>
<li> reviews, but was so desperate that I thought it was worth a try.</li>
<li> and I zap my annoying pimples away. : )</li>
<li> but I wouldn&#x27;t plonk down the dollars again.</li>
<li> The product actually works, but I&#x27;m very unhappy with the Tanda people right now.</li>
<li> Now, less than two weeks after using the product, the power cord has stopped working.</li>
<li> I had very low expectations for this based on the very mixed (and seemingly fake??)</li>
<li> They also end up peeling if I use harsh creams like BP or Salicyclic Acid</li>
<li> Just plug it in for a few hours every month or so.  </li>
<li> There&#x27;s no comparison: 2 1/2 minutes, 3 times a day for at least 3 days with minimal results for the Tanda, 30 seconds once or twice a day for two days and the blemish is gone for the Zeno...</li>
<li> i was skeptical but it does work, it doesnt completely take a breakout away</li>
<li> I am in my 30s, and don&#x27;t have terrible acne, but about once a month I get around 3 very large, noticeable cystic pimples that are unbelievably painful, red, and so deep beneath the surface of the skin that topical treatments do nothing.</li>
<li> It sort of just time freezes the acne and just slowly shrinks from there.</li>
<li> so I can&#x27;t even cover them up as they look worse and flaky.</li>
<li> but unfortunately this did not work for her.</li>
<li> I get an occasional zit every now and then - which I hate! -</li>
<li> (not to mention being incredibly painful).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product actually works, but I&#x27;m very unhappy with the Tanda people right now. After reading all of the reviews about the problems with batteries, I bought the Tanda Zap power, which has a power cord. Now, less than two weeks after using the product, the power cord has stopped working. What kind of product would stop working after two weeks?</li>
    <li> When it comes to clearing up acne, this thing works. The problem is, it doesn&#x27;t last long. I also had the replaceable battery powered one and that lasted much longer than this one. After about 8 weeks of minimal use, this one has already lost its capacity to run at full power. It grinds and vibrates slowly or not at all, even when fully charged. It has also lost some of its sensitivity - it is supposed to start up when touching the skin, but it now requires pressing onto the skin. I love it, but the lack of longevity is a bummer.</li>
    <li> I should have dug further into researching this product, I think it does help though I don&#x27;t see a significant change in 24 hours other than it doesn&#x27;t grow bigger. It sort of just time freezes the acne and just slowly shrinks from there. BUT remember this is to be used THREE TIMES A DAY to see any changes. I like the Tanda Power Zap a lot but it&#x27;s very time consuming.</li>
    <li> My daughter has acne on her back and face. We have tried so many different things to help her. She was so hopeful but unfortunately this did not work for her.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been impressed with the effectiveness of my Zeno Hot Spot until it fizzled out. Because the few of those that are left are so much more expensive than they were originally, I decided I&#x27;d have to use another device and opted for the Tanda Power Zap. There&#x27;s no comparison: 2 1/2 minutes, 3 times a day for at least 3 days with minimal results for the Tanda, 30 seconds once or twice a day for two days and the blemish is gone for the Zeno... I&#x27;m scrambling for funds to snap up a remaining Zeno!!!</li>
    <li> Keeps pimples from getting inflamed &amp; infected, but doesnt get ridof them.  can be time consuming.</li>
    <li> I had two of the original Tanda zap. THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to constantly replace the AAA batteries.. Luckily, I didn&#x27;t pay too much for the original Tanda Zap. I saw this and I had to have it, just in time, since my 2nd Tanda Zap just stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;Ok, This item is great, because you an press a button to turn it on. The blue light comes on with a slight warmth and vibration. It will beep one time when the 2 mins is up. You can either continue to treat the same pimple or move on. Press the button again and it will beep twice to turn it off.  I also like the indicator lights for battery life. It works, but you must use it as soon as you feel it. I keep it by my bed, use it while watching tv and I zap my annoying pimples away. : )</li>
    <li> This product works really well, within 2-3 applications the zit is gone, its a good preventer.  I usually get a few blemishes throughout the week, but I haven&#x27;t had one so far for an entire week.  The charge on it lasts a long time.  I saw the original zap, where it had batteries and the number one complaint was that it ran through them quickly, mine keeps its charge for a long time, I charge it about once a week, and then just plug it in.  Nothing to complain about.</li>
    <li> My two teenagers both use this.  If it&#x27;s really used 3x in a day, the pimple will be gone the next day.  The dermatologist said to follow this treatment with salicylic acid 2% the next day to help get rid of the dead skin cells for a quicker clearing, and to erase any coloration from the pimple.</li>
    <li> I want to thank you all for the patience, as it was the first time bought something abroad!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s shipped VERY FAST.&lt;br /&gt;The product really works, I just don&#x27;t give a 5 star concept &#x27;cause i wanted it to make a micracle!!!! It&#x27;s awsome!</li>
    <li> i was skeptical but it does work, it doesnt completely take a breakout away but it definitely helps, i use this for spot treatment and not acne.</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know how effective this product is. It seems inconsistent. I&#x27;ve used it religiously 3 times a day on certain break-outs and it seems to have minimized them but others, it had absolutely no effect from what I can see. I&#x27;ll probably continue to use it just for the psychological aspect of appearing to do something but I wouldn&#x27;t plonk down the dollars again.</li>
    <li> I had very low expectations for this based on the very mixed (and seemingly fake??) reviews, but was so desperate that I thought it was worth a try. I am in my 30s, and don&#x27;t have terrible acne, but about once a month I get around 3 very large, noticeable cystic pimples that are unbelievably painful, red, and so deep beneath the surface of the skin that topical treatments do nothing. They really do affect my life as I feel very self conscious about them, and they take so long to go away (not to mention being incredibly painful). They also end up peeling if I use harsh creams like BP or Salicyclic Acid so I can&#x27;t even cover them up as they look worse and flaky. So willing to try anything, I bought this, and hoped for the best. At present, I have 3 cystic pimples at various stages - 1 just forming (very deep and I can feel it but not see it), 1 about mid-way through (just starting to see it and very red/painful), and 1 that&#x27;s about a week old that is huge, painful and extremely noticeable. I used the Tanda Zap 3 times yesterday for the first time on each one, and when I woke up this morning, the new pimple had pretty much gone, the 2nd one hadn&#x27;t progressed and was no longer red or painful, and the biggest one had been bought to a head so is now on its way out and greatly reduced. For me, that&#x27;s a miracle, as I was expecting to wake up with progression of all 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a miracle cure and will not get rid of big pimples overnight, but the fact that I saw such an improvement was a miracle in itself and I will continue to use this product if it keeps giving me these results. If I can catch a pimple as soon as it starts and get rid of it before it escalates, it will change my life. So this would be worth its weight in gold!</li>
    <li> Works great if you have mild blemishes.</li>
    <li> I am always quite skeptical about gadgets like this, but I am happy to report that this thing really does seem to work! I get an occasional zit every now and then - which I hate! - so I figured I&#x27;d give this a try. I have had it for about 2 months, during which I have used it 4 times, and every time the zit vanished after just one or two &amp;#34;treatments&amp;#34; (which is simply turning it on and holding it with the light against your skin for a few minutes; there is NO pain, NO heat or anything discernible that you can feel; it&#x27;s just like holding a small flashlight against your face for a little while). In all 4 cases, I used it IMMEDIATELY as soon as I noticed that little &amp;#34;bump&amp;#34; starting to form under the surface, so I can&#x27;t say how effective it would be on existing pimples, but from my experience if you catch it right away, this thing will indeed prevent those tiny bumps from emerging into full blown pimples, and I am really happy I took a chance on this gadget!</li>
    <li> great product. but. dunno if its the placebo effect. how could such a tiny light help so much. i use to go to a thermotolagist all the time. had laser done for acne. i kno its alot stronger grade. but ....... this product works a lil. but maybe a placebo effect. idk to be honest</li>
    <li> love it does everything it says it does</li>
    <li> It works if you have a few pimples and it really depends on what type or types of acne you have. Personally, it doesn&#x27;t work for whitehead or blackhead but works better for swollen and red acnes.</li>
    <li> This actually works! I&#x27;ve seen major improvement. I keep it in my purse and give myself treatments on the way to work, at lunch, and on the way home. Definitely slows down growth and minimizes acne size.</li>
    <li> Much better than the one that requires a change of batteries every 100 uses.  Just plug it in for a few hours every month or so.  It kills regular zits easily and the monster zits are better than they would have been.</li>
