      <li>, my skin stays mostly pretty clear (a few breakouts during my period).</li>
      <li>But spend the extra dollars and purchase either directly from Murad or Sephora.</li>
      <li>I have  a 17 year old daughter who has battled moderate to severe acne for over 3 years now....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried this exact same product before in the small tube purchased from Sephora and it worked wonders for my adult onset hormonal cystic acne</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m on day 3 of using this product and I am completely satisfied!!!! My skin suffers from breakouts and oiliness and this miracle in a bottle has been keeping my worries at bay. definitely worth the iinvestment! A little goes a long way and be careful.because this product is a bit drying. As long as you have a good moisturizer tailored to your needs you will be good. I like to moisturize with coconut oil, I&#x27;m just saying.</li>
    <li> Excellent product as usual!</li>
    <li> Good value at this price and size. Works well for mild acne. Does smell a little funky.</li>
    <li> Been using this product since 2007 and works very good with acne and break outs.</li>
    <li> you are not getting a deal, then the extra money and go to Sephora, Ulta or your favorite spa. toto get the real stuff! disappointed it made my daughters skin break out. the real Murad actually works really really well!</li>
    <li> Been using this for over 15 years and skipped a year of using it by switching to another brand.  I definitely was an eye-opening difference to see how superior this product is to even more expensive ultra high-end spa brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really great value.</li>
    <li> Great value for this solid product.</li>
    <li> Excellent cleanser when other name brand Acne products have failed. This doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin and has really helped my adult onset acne. I use two times daily along with the exfoliating gel by Murad. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Love that they sell it in this size.</li>
    <li> Great cleaner more for you&#x27;re money</li>
    <li> VERY HAPPY WITH THIS WASH. IT MAKES MY SKIN FEEL AMAZING</li>
    <li> Love this bigger size!! And the price!!</li>
    <li> great product, great price, love that it comes in pump</li>
    <li> Best acne prone cleanser !</li>
    <li> I ordered this product 6 weeks ago and have been using it every day since then. So I have given it a fair chance. I&#x27;ve tried this exact same product before in the small tube purchased from Sephora and it worked wonders for my adult onset hormonal cystic acne so I figured I would buy the larger size at a better price from amazon. That was a huge mistake. Both original product and this product smell differently and feel different on my skin. This product actually has made my acne worse! So two days ago I tried the product I had from sephora and after two days of use my acne is getting remarkably better. I contacted MURAD this morning and they said that although this product exists this size, third party retailers that are not licensed aestheticians are only allowed to sell the 6.75 ounce tube and that amazon is not an approved distributor of this product. Deeply disappointed as I feel like I&#x27;ve completely wasted money now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice: get this product if you have acne because I&#x27;ve tried everything and anything and this is one of the best things that has worked for me. But spend the extra dollars and purchase either directly from Murad or Sephora.</li>
    <li> I have  a 17 year old daughter who has battled moderate to severe acne for over 3 years now....weve tried everything except Accutane...that included prescription topicals to antibiotics, to every over the counter regime known. She started the Murad acne line 8 weeks ago. She started with the Acne starter kit system (cleanser, toner, cream, moisturizer). This is the first time she has a &amp;#34;purge&amp;#34; with using any product, so I do need to warn, the acne got much worse before it got better. During the 8 weeks things are slowly improving, but you do have to be patient. She has not had any additional outbreaks after the purge and her face is nearly clear now...I mean clear and beautiful. After the purge, there were many red marks etc. that are slowly healing. About 2 weeks after she started the system on her face, she added the clarifying pills to help combat the facial acne and work on her chest and back. About 2 weeks in, her back (covered in acne from shoulder line to below bra line) and chest show huge improvement and now a month later, her chest is clear and her back is almost clear. We are not sure if the facial system is what is continuing to improve her face, or if adding this has helped, but she will continue both. Her confidence has boosted and she is wearing backless dresses for the first time in years. I rarely write reviews but wanted to share as I know this is a battle for many. Ive seen her improvment and it&#x27;s truly miraculous! I am so thankful that the reviews of others steered us to try this 1 last product and wanted to wait for time to pass before writing a review. My hope is it will last and if not, we will write an updated review.</li>
    <li> This is awesome.  I can&#x27;t believe I ever used anything else to cleanse my face.  Murad has us covered.  You just can&#x27;t go back to any other brand.</li>
    <li> The item arrived in a timely manner.  However, I&#x27;ve used this product in the past, in a tube.  For some reason, the liquid in this bottle does not quite smell the same and seems a little harsh on my skin, yet it&#x27;s &#x27;supposed&#x27; to be the same product.</li>
    <li> I love the larger size since it&#x27;s a product line I&#x27;ve been using for about 10 years now.  It&#x27;s not the cheapest nor the most expensive but it works on controlling my adult acne better than anything I&#x27;ve ever found.  I am now 46 and my teenage acne and oily skin never left me.  I am allergic to benzoyl peroxide.  I use the gel and the moisturizer from the Murad Acne line also.  I don&#x27;t use the toner - I use witch hazel.  I rarely use the spot remover/acne treatment. I often wash my face at night using a small round loofah pad when I feel I could use some extra exfoliation.  Lately I have had some problems with cystic acne (oh joy) since I am peri-menopausal.  I&#x27;ve been getting a facial about every two months and between the facial and the Murad, my skin stays mostly pretty clear (a few breakouts during my period).</li>
    <li> The cleanser is a savior. Light and leaves skin without any residue and feeling clean.</li>
    <li> Great value in this size.  Really prevents acne from appearing on face.  Use twice a day for best results.  The best product I have used that doesn&#x27;t drt out skin.</li>
    <li> Great product! Received in timely manner. Everything as expected.</li>
    <li> Too Expensive and it doesn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s rep.</li>
    <li> I have struggles with acne my adult life.  This cleanser has helped dramatically.  I use it with the Clarisonic and rarely get break outs any more.</li>
    <li> love this stuff... cleans my skin and almost completely stops my breakouts... nothing has ever worked like this before. Great!!</li>
    <li> And the SIZE can&#x27;t be beat. I&#x27;ve loved the Murad Line since trying in 2012. This is a great refreshing cleanser for the face. Love this product for face and body.</li>
    <li> One of the best cleansers</li>
    <li> I loved finding this in the large size. I use it every day, so the convenience is amazing!</li>
