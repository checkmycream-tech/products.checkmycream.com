      <li>wish I could really give this product more stars, but the reason I will put it at 2 is because the seller who I ordered this from (BoevyShop) ripped me off</li>
      <li>Full bottle.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s not bad but they should make an unsented one.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was quick too.</li>

      <li>But i love the smell and the way it make my skin soft</li>

      <li>The price is very reasonable.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m African American but have very fair, sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t know how safe this product actually is</li>
      <li>First off the wording is an Arabic.</li>
      <li>I really like how the smell stays on my skin all day and makes my skin smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>Beware of all positive fees backs for rating products a 5.</li>
      <li>Vaseline healthy white is non greasy and light on the skin at the same time evens the skin tone and gives a rosy complexion .</li>
      <li>I was surprised the product worked effectively &amp; quickly.  </li>
      <li>The product darkened with time, It was drying and very inefficient.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>So anyone out there who wants lighter skin read this&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
      <li>Really works.......</li>
      <li>and it really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t do much moisturizing to my skin as I had to apply it 2-3 times a day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very dissatisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>Although this product did not make me lighter, it significantly evened out my skin tone and got rid of the extra tan I had on my arms.</li>
      <li>This particular product by Vaseline Intensive Care delivers whitening &amp; moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I like the price of when I bought it, and the smell is easy to get through, unlike other lightening lotions I have tried.</li>
      <li>Not too overbearing &amp; gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It is definitely worth buying if you just want to even out skin and get rid of a tan, but it will not actually make you lighter.</li>
      <li>I threw it into a trash can right after I open the package and tried to smell the lotion.  </li>
      <li>Luckily, nothing bad happened and nothing good happened either.  </li>
      <li>this this offers no sun protection and caused me to get a rash</li>
      <li>effect so far.</li>
      <li>natural color intact.</li>
      <li>There are slot of fake reviews on here to make products look as if the quality is good when it&#x27;s not.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a little too pricey but definitely worth it!</li>
      <li>I felt a little burning but after that it literally turned super white.</li>

<li> I felt a little burning but after that it literally turned super white.</li>
<li> With that said this product did lighten my skin in two weeks like it claims but its smells a little funny, like a dry floral smell.</li>
<li> but there minor changes already.</li>
<li> Maybe this is is not really produced by &amp;#34;Vaseline&amp;#34; after all.</li>
<li> You have to use it CONSTANTLY for it to have a lightning effect and even so its very slight.</li>
<li> I prefer this as a sunscreen because other products i have used burned as I was out in the sun.</li>
<li> Dry up a bunch of orange peels this will take awhile once it&#x27;s dried up crush</li>
<li> Those companies typically does break out your skin.</li>
<li> The effect is so slight that if you dont use sunscreen you may as well just be using lotion.</li>
<li> I was surprised that the product came from Asia; the directions and content ingredients were not in english and now that I&#x27;m writing this I must have been desperate to use something I couldn&#x27;t read.  </li>
<li> I just gotta keep using it everyday.</li>
<li> I have been using this product for about a week now, Everyday.</li>
<li> do not buy this product,it was a waste of money... not recommended</li>
<li> i just a few days now</li>
<li> I am naturally pale but not lightening</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if it lightens or not because I use another product for lightning</li>
<li> The bottle is small</li>
<li> I knew things shipping from overseas usually takes a while, but then Oct. came around and then Nov. and then Dec</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have tan/olive skin. Although this product did not make me lighter, it significantly evened out my skin tone and got rid of the extra tan I had on my arms. It smells wonderful and isn&#x27;t greasy at all. It is definitely worth buying if you just want to even out skin and get rid of a tan, but it will not actually make you lighter.</li>
    <li> This is really good. It&#x27;s light, smell awesome, very hydrating and safe. Shipping was quick too. thank you. I will recommend that to all women around the world.</li>
    <li> do you always have to use this once your skin is lightened or do you stop using after it is lightened</li>
    <li> I got this at a local store when I was in India, and I put it on the top of my hand to test it out and let me just say that this product is AMAZING. It worked! I felt a little burning but after that it literally turned super white. I don&#x27;t know if this will work for everyone though and I don&#x27;t know how safe this product actually is but it works.</li>
    <li> You have to use it CONSTANTLY for it to have a lightning effect and even so its very slight. I use this after I exfoliate. Sunscreen is the key tho. The effect is so slight that if you dont use sunscreen you may as well just be using lotion. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months now. I&#x27;m African American but have very fair, sensitive skin. I got it to remove my farmers tan and maybe(hope beyond hope) my stretch marks, needless to say i was a little disappointed. Very good moisturizer tho. I&#x27;m always silky, even the baby could tell the difference.</li>
    <li> Packaged nicely. Full bottle.I have been using this product for about a week now, Everyday. I prefer this as a sunscreen because other products i have used burned as I was out in the sun. I am naturally pale but not lightening effect so far. Pleasant smell. Not too overbearing &amp; gentle on my sensitive skin. I am the type who breaks out into hives when i use lotion but this is wonderful. No break outs at all. &amp; feels wonderful as I am out in the sun. Thank you. Package also came to me on time as well. Very pleased with that.</li>
    <li> did not work @ all..think it made my skin darker...do not buy this product,it was a waste of money... not recommended</li>
    <li> I purchased this and a few other bleaching products after I got a horrible allergic reaction to something that left &#x27;marks&#x27; on my arms and torso.  I was surprised that the product came from Asia; the directions and content ingredients were not in english and now that I&#x27;m writing this I must have been desperate to use something I couldn&#x27;t read.  Luckily, nothing bad happened and nothing good happened either.  I still have the marks.  The fragrance is really nice and the lotion leaves your hands very soft.  The bottle is small so I got two weeks out of it by only using it on my hands and arms.  I&#x27;d try it again if it wasn&#x27;t coming from Asia and if the bottle were bigger.  I tried to find it in at my local stores but no luck.</li>
    <li> So anyone out there who wants lighter skin read this&lt;br /&gt;Make your own&lt;br /&gt;1. Strong sun lotion ( protection)&lt;br /&gt;2. Good oil like Aragon oil or carrot seed oil ( healing/soften effect)&lt;br /&gt;3. B3 liquid ( suppose to lighten skin)&lt;br /&gt;4. Dry up a bunch of orange peels this will take awhile once it&#x27;s dried up crush it make a powder ( natural bleach for skin)&lt;br /&gt;Mix this all up and got something that is cheaper and way better then this</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product! smells refreshing.. doesn&#x27;t feel oily on your skin..&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little too pricey but definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> I just received the Vaseline so i can&#x27;t say if it works or not. But i love the smell and the way it make my skin soft i just a few days now so i can&#x27;t say if it will lighten my skin or not.</li>
    <li> I am not too sure this a safe product to use... I do not see any affects on the skin but I am going to hold off on using it...</li>
    <li> Didnt do anything to my skin. It is way over price...</li>
    <li> Did not work at all. Been using this product about two weeks now with NO visible results. Smells good and thats about it.</li>
    <li> I like the price of when I bought it, and the smell is easy to get through, unlike other lightening lotions I have tried. I&#x27;ve noticed a very subtle difference in complexion, but it&#x27;s not drastic. I&#x27;m talking very subtle. It&#x27;s best to also stay out of the sun as much as possible if you&#x27;re trying to go lighter in general.</li>
    <li> I love love love this Vaseline Healthy White it makes my skin glow I will buy this again soon&lt;br /&gt;It evens out my skin tone when I apply my make up I look fab</li>
    <li> Never had a problem with vaseline products, but this product gave me rashes. It didn&#x27;t really smooth or brighten my skin.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do what it claim it does. 😈</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very dissatisfied with this product. First off the wording is an Arabic. I read only English. This product does not do what it says that it suppose to do</li>
    <li> The lotion was expired and smelled so bad.   I threw it into a trash can right after I open the package and tried to smell the lotion.  So disappointed!    Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> Not seeing the results I thought would appear. Has been 2 weeks of use now. Sells good and good for my sensitive skin. Will try another brand in the future to see if results differ.</li>
    <li> WARNING: Do not buy from BoevyShop&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could really give this product more stars, but the reason I will put it at 2 is because the seller who I ordered this from (BoevyShop) ripped me off and I never got the product. They took my money and I was updated that the product would get to me within a month (supposed to get to me sometime in Oct.) since it was being shipped from overseas. I knew things shipping from overseas usually takes a while, but then Oct. came around and then Nov. and then Dec... and it never came.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that... I have used this product before in the past and it works well if you are willing to wait a while for results. It claims that it makes your skin lighter within 2 weeks and it really doesn&#x27;t. I bought it to help even out and get rid of the mosquito bite scar spot (looks like hyperpigmentation/sunspot) that I had gotten when visiting family in the Philippines. For me it took all 3 bottles that I bought of this from Watsons and a good 4-5 months before I saw any results of the spots diminishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is however a really good moisturizer and has a lovely smell, just takes a while for the results to kick in. But all products do anyways.</li>
    <li> And stinky junk too. The product darkened with time, It was drying and very inefficient. My skin began to turn greyish. I considered suing because this is a very bad product. My skin looked worse after two weeks. I used it for 3 months and my skin was so bad afterwards, I had to correct it with other expensive procedures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now. I do not see any difference in my skin. It has a nice smell but that&#x27;s about it. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product is easily absorbed into the skin.  It leaves the skin smooth, moisturized and with lightly scented aroma.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product. The product arrived well before the given shipping date.</li>
    <li> I really like how the smell stays on my skin all day and makes my skin smooth and soft. Wish they have a bigger size on this so I can continue using it.</li>
    <li> the deliver was as expected, and the product is good, I cant tell now either the product suits me as I have to wait after  two weeks time of usage to see how it works. but there minor changes already.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell, it&#x27;s not bad but they should make an unsented one.  Ive been using it for 2 weeks and haven&#x27;t seen a difference</li>
    <li> This worked for me it fades over time you have to use it daily. Sometimes I didn&#x27;t but it still faded my skin discolorations leaving&lt;br /&gt;my natural color intact.</li>
    <li> I actually like this lotion. I&#x27;m not sure if it lightens or not because I use another product for lightning and I thought this lotion would be a good assist. It smells great and the bottle is a pretty nice size for the value. I would deff buy and use this product again. Oh yea and it came earlier than the date I was given. Good job seller</li>
    <li> It works, I tried it on after I took a shower I can notice a big change it gotten my skin lighter. I just gotta keep using it everyday. I will see a huge change.  Thank! Will definitely buy more in the when I run out!!</li>
    <li> Maybe this is is not really produced by &amp;#34;Vaseline&amp;#34; after all. Vaseline is a great company like Johnson &amp;Johnson. Those companies typically does break out your skin. Perhaps this is some knock off cause they know people trust Vaseline. The second hit is someone on here said it was runny.... Vaseline doesn&#x27;t make products that are made with runny substances. This is a fake product made overseas somewhere. Thanks to everyone&#x27;s honest feed back under the score of rating it a 1. Beware of all positive fees backs for rating products a 5. There are slot of fake reviews on here to make products look as if the quality is good when it&#x27;s not.</li>
    <li> this this offers no sun protection and caused me to get a rash it didn&#x27;t lighten my skin and nothing on the bottle was in English</li>
    <li> I loved it. It was a very good product, but I wished I had bought the larger one. It is good value for money.</li>
    <li> This particular product by Vaseline Intensive Care delivers whitening &amp; moisturizer.  I was surprised the product worked effectively &amp; quickly.  As a fair skinned Irish girl, I suffer from mottled skin coloring.  This product repairs the skin&#x27;s discoloration rapidly &amp; effectively.  I am very pleased.  I now have my husband using it.  I find blessings in unexpected places delightful.  The price is very reasonable.  Ocean Discount is my favorite Amazon vendor.  Quick delivery &amp; consistent customer service have me returning for more every month.  A+++++.</li>
    <li> Vaseline healthy white is non greasy and light on the skin at the same time evens the skin tone and gives a rosy complexion . My skin has gone lighter and looks radiant  in just a week twice application . It does not have a sunscreen protection though .It&#x27;s an excellent buy but I wished it came in a larger package .</li>
    <li> I was disappointed to see my skin darken after this product suppose to have triple sunscreen protection. I won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
    <li> Really works.......wonderful product to use. I would recommend to buy it and try it. It works like an charm!!! Thanks</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin but was looking for a product to help make all of my skin even because my arms and legs were slightly tanner than the rest of my body. With that said this product did lighten my skin in two weeks like it claims but its smells a little funny, like a dry floral smell. It didn&#x27;t do much moisturizing to my skin as I had to apply it 2-3 times a day. It also says it had sunscreen in it but I cant find the &amp;#34;spf&amp;#34;. . . overall it did what it was meant to do but I don&#x27;t think id buy it again unless I needed to.</li>
