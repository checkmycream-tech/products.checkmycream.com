<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love this cream. I used to use mousse which always left my hair crunchy and I got tired of that look. I switched to this which I use with a little bit of protein gel (Pro Styl) and its been like a hair transformation. My curls are soft and touchable but intact and not frizzy. Its def a different look than what I am used to but I love it! Also, this cream smells great! Has a fresh scent to it that stays in your hair for days. I have 2B-2C hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I have wavy hair and the bouncy creme keeps the curls and waves in without drying my hair out or leaving a flaky mess.</li>
    <li> I like the feeling of extra body the cream give to wet hair. I dry mine before curling/styling. After curling, the curls seem to last longer.</li>

    <li> She loves this stuff..and always get it from Amazon</li>
    <li> I have been using this on and off for about a year.  Mostly it works well, although if I want my hair to have more body and curl I use a mousse made for curly hair.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser recommended this product to give my hair some extra bounce and define curls and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Not only did it work, but it worked BETTER than many more expensive products I&#x27;ve tried. Love that I can get this product at a great price and quick via Prime!</li>

    <li> This is my go-to product for second-day curls! I have 2A/3C curls, and just a small amount of this works great to allow me to use second and even third-day hair. I just wet it with a lavendar mist and apply about 2 pumps of this stuff...miraculous! Love it!</li>
    <li> I had to go online to find this product. It keeps my natural curly hair from being frizzy and helps it style.</li>
    <li> Hard to believe but I&#x27;ve been using this product for probably 15 yrs. AT LEAST.  IT IS THE ONLY product that creates those spiral type curls for my naturally curly hair.
