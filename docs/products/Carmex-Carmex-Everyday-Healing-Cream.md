<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this cream! It really helped me with my dry, cracked feet. I tried many products before but this is the one that really worked for me. First, the cream is very moisturizing and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth without making it look and feel greasy. The skin absorbs the cream easily which makes all the difference. Also, it helps to relieve the uneasy and uncomfortable feeling of dry cracked skin, it is safe to say that it really does heal the skin. The best part is that it is for everyday use so I don’t have to worry about using it too much or too often and the fact that it also doesn’t have an offensive smell, like some of other dry skin creams, also helps a lot.  I would recommend it to anyone dealing with dry skin issues and it&#x27;s a must-have with this cold, dry winter weather coming up that tends to dry out my skin in other areas of the body as well. Not only does it work, it is affordable as well. What more can one ask for?</li>
    <li> A few weeks back, my girlfriend saw a couple varieties of Carmex lotion at the drug store. When she told me what she had seen, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out.   I&#x27;ve been a huge fan of Carmex for there lip balm, for years. Sadly my hands, which get severely dry, rough and cracked (especially during winter months), where not as lucky to have a product as great as Carmex. Thankfully that has now changed.  I&#x27;ve been using the healing cream religiously for a little better than a month now, and the difference it has made has been phenomenal. I can not say that it has completely healed my hands yet, however it has greatly helped in restoring them to at least a level where the skin at the front corners of my thumb nail aren&#x27;t split open a bleeding. My typically white ash knuckles look like they are part of a human hand once again. And more importantly my girlfriend has stopped referring to my hands as a grinding wheel.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin feel very smooth, but doesn&#x27;t seem greasy.  This product doesn&#x27;t seem to be sold in my drugstore anymore, so I am happy that I can get it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Buy the 3 pack same price as 13 oz pump but never have to deal with broken pump like I do</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hand cream I have ever tried!  I used to have extremely dry and cracked cuticles to the point that I had to hide my hands out out of embarrassment.  There was one product, a Sephora brand cuticle oil pen,  that I have used that worked okay to try and moisturize them but was very expensive. This product not only works much better but is much more affordable. I apply it a couple of times a day as cuticle cream and within a week it has totally healed my horrible hang nails and cracked skin.  It is also amazing as a hand cream because it absorbs almost immediately, leaving no residue what so ever.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion! It is spendy here on Amazon but I&#x27;m trying to find it cheaper elsewhere. Either way, this lotion is so awesome! It moisturizes  without leaving your hands greasy. I can&#x27;t emphasize how much I LOVE this lotion! If only it were easier to find....</li>
    <li> Love this stuff for my hands and feet. I put it on every night just before I climb into bed. I need to be sure to really rub it on for a good 20-30 seconds and it lasts all night. I wake up and my feet and hands feel soft! I usually use Cetaphil in the jar - which I love for all over - but this Carmex Healing Cream just gives my feet and hands the extra boost it needs.</li>
    <li> I work with vehicles a lot in my spare time, and although I should be using gloves, most of the time I don&#x27;t. My hands get dry and sore, and Carmex Healing Cream is one of the only products that helps. It soaks in instantly, and leaves my hands feeling great. It really does help with sore, dry skin, and I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling greasy at all. Great product!</li>
    <li> I use it mostly in the winter on my hands as they tend to get very dry from being outdoors a lot. It&#x27;s non-greasy, absorbs quickly and it works very well. I would have given it 5 stars, but I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent. Fortunately it&#x27;s not too strong so not a big deal.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. It makes my hands and feet feel so smooth.</li>
    <li> This product is okay.  It works on dry skin.  I was looking for more of a product that would help with chafing, but i have found that this product is good for dry skin in general.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic! My husband is in construction, works a lot outdoors. He uses this on his hands and it really works. I use it as well, on my hands, feet, elbows. Surprised though that Amazon is charging so much for it. We can get it in our local Family Dollar for $4.50.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of the regular Carmex, so when I saw that they made a hand lotion I had to at least give it a try.  I figured if it worked half as good as the lip product I would be very happy.    My hands get very dry and this winter seemed to have been worse than prior years. I have tried many lotions to ease this problem.  I have to say that I am very pleased with the Carmex Healing Cream.  The scent is light and works well for both male and female users - my husband uses this product and likes it.  The cream also absorbs quickly and is not greasy at all.  This is a major selling point to me. I am pleasantly surprised by this because usually the healing lotions/creams are very greasy. I have been using it for a week and my hands do feel softer and more comfortable.  I do plan on purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> As I get older I have had more and more trouble keeping my skin soft. This is the only thing that I found that does just that, without an obnoxious smell and a greasy feeling.  This lotion soaks in within seconds and lasts a long time. I just wish it was more widely available. I have had a hard time finding it locally.</li>
    <li> My hands especially need extra care when it&#x27;s cold.  I&#x27;ve used half of the product and it leaves my hands feeling dried out, arms and elbows too.  It doesn&#x27;t have the feel of a lotion.  I wont buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have used Carmex lip moisturizing in the tube for years [[ASIN:B001KYTQ8W Carmex - Lip Moisturizing Tube, Original Balm - 0.35 Oz (3 each)]]. I like that product a lot so decided to try this skin care healing cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that I like this cream too. It has a light fragrance that I do not mind. I&#x27;m sensitive to overly perfumed scents and this is not strong nor objectionable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I squirt about an inch long strip of this on the back of one of my hands and then just rub in in with both hands. It&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs quickly yet leaves a soft, moisturized feeling on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say that this is the best or my favorite hand cream because it isn&#x27;t. But I can say that I like this and I find the tube convenient to use in the car. It&#x27;s not expensive like my \\&quot;favorite\\&quot; hand cream is and it&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll grab first when my hands are feeling a little dry. If I need to bring out the heavy artillery, then I&#x27;ll go get my \\&quot;favorite\\&quot; cream that goes on a little thicker and does leave a more greasy feeling on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good body cream at a fair price.</li>
    <li> Yummy! I love being on the Carmex Blog Squad. Every so often I get these great packages of new Carmex products to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The current package is full of these great new lotions. My favorite is the Carmex Healing Cream. I just got a new tattoo, while it was healing I used tattoo approved a &amp; D cream. But after it healed I still wanted to keep my skin on and around the tattoo soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Carmex Healing Cream and it&#x27;s been working great. The cream smells good and is not greasy at all. I like the cream the best. It also comes in a good size for the price. Great value!</li>
    <li> This new Carmex product is a non-greasy healing lotion for healing and moisturizing very dry and rough skin.&lt;br /&gt;Contains 9 healing ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This healing cream soaks in well  ~ it&#x27;s silky smooth &amp; creamy and leaves skin feeling soft.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave the palm of my hands feeling greasy or tacky.&lt;br /&gt;The cream absorbs quickly and is a satisfying answer to any rough area.&lt;br /&gt;It has a very light pleasing vanilla fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using the &#x27;Original Carmex&#x27; in a tube, for years for those areas,&lt;br /&gt;although it&#x27;s a little greasy from the beeswax, that didn&#x27;t bother me because it&#x27;s economical,&lt;br /&gt;convenient, and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happened across this product at our local sporting goods store in a handy 3/4 oz pocket size, for $1.29.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion, (as with all the Carmex products I&#x27;ve used) ~ is a great product that works.</li>
    <li> I used this item for itchy dry skin on my hands and it dried it up in little to no time at all. It&#x27;s non greasy and it is easily absorbed into the skin. Carmex Replenishing  Cream is one item i would highly recommend to anyone with dry itchy scaly skin. Try it cause it really works.</li>
    <li> I love Carmex lip balms, so when I saw that they were selling a new lotion I decided to give it a try. My hands get dry really easily if I wash them too much, especially in the winter months with flu season, so I needed a moisturizer that would keep them soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is amazing! It soaks into your skin, leaving it smooth and soft but without the greasy residue that most other lotions leave behind. And it smells really good, a light, fresh scent that&#x27;s not too strong. All in all, a great product that I will definitely be buying again when I run out. Who knew Carmex could make such great skincare products?</li>
    <li> First, I love the product and it&#x27;s my most preferred lotion. I hate oily, gross lotion, but this absorbs, doesn&#x27;t smell bad and works. I used the hydrating lotion for a long time and just came across this one. From what I can tell it&#x27;s essentially the same product with the same smell, texture and healing properties but it&#x27;s more dense/thicker. I think this probably helps it fill cracks and stay in them a little better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell to me is a very slight/light vanilla, and overall I love it. I&#x27;ve paid all amounts for all brands of lotions and this is still my favorite.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this lotion!! I am glad to see it is available on Amazon. I originally purchased it as part of a comfort package gift for a sick friend, and just had to buy a tube for myself since I love Carmex lip products. I have never been so happy with a lotion (geez, it is just lotion, but man, it is great!). It has really helped my dry feet. And I have found myself using it on my hands all the time....sometimes they almost get pruney from using it too much. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> As a member of the Carmex blog squad I got the opportunity to try this out for free - I have since purchased it on my own. I love the light scent and find that it moisturizes more than just the top layer of skin. I really enjoy using this cream - it does not leave a greasy residue but does offer continuous moisture. The scent is similar to the carmex lip balm - but lighter and more feminine. Another great plus is that a little goes a long way. I used this on very cracked heels and they clear up in a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to anyone that suffers from dry/cracking skin. If you do not like the scent of Carmex you may not like the scent of this product. I have met some that cannot use because the scent is similar to the lip cream.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion and I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in the stores. It does not feel sticky, actually absorbs into the skin and keeps my hands from drying out after numerous hand washings!</li>
    <li> I liked it but it was not the one that I had purchased before.</li>
    <li> I have tried many hand creams and have very sensitive skin. My hands crack in winter. This stuff absorbs quickly and is not greasy and has a mild, pleasant smell. I have bought it more than once and hope they continue to make it.</li>
    <li> I am a bit obsessed with lotions, lip balms, etc, so I rarely get excited by a product; most are a variation of the same thing. But this stuff was given to me as a gift and it is now my FAVORITE cream, hands down. It soaks in SO fast and leaves my skin silky. It smells delicious, and my skin actually stays hydrated and soft. There is no gunky feeling, no greasy feeling. My husband tried some and he loved it so much, he stole it from me - this coming from a man who normally detests body products of any kind! Do yourself a favor and try this stuff. It does not disappoint.</li>
    <li> I love all Carmex products and this is no exception. Very thick and creamy, and at the same time not at all greasy. Love this lotion, buy it all the time.</li>
    <li> This lotion is terrific - love it because it is NOT greasy and does a really terrific job of moisturizing!</li>
    <li> Works really well for my dry hands</li>
    <li> This is an indispensable product in my house.  Very effective for windburn/chapped parts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a nurse so you can imagine how dry my hands get with all that constant washing. This non-greasy cream is so great on your driest skin so think what it does for the rest of you. It&#x27;s so non-greasy for instance, I can put it on and go right to typing without getting it all over the keyboard. I like to put it on right before bed, it soaks in instantly and then I wake up with the softest smoothest skin ever. I love the scent too, it&#x27;s very pleasant and light. For the very best results put it on right after a shower. I have very dry skin so sometimes I use this everywhere and concentrate on hands, lower arms (starting to get that loose skin there and it soothes, plumps up and it greatly reduces that crepey effect) and feet. Having such dry skin I&#x27;ve tried everything on the market and so far this has been the best! Love, love, love it.</li>
    <li> This was the first time trying lotion from Carmex and I love it!!! I&#x27;ve used their lip balm over the years and always thought it to be a great product so I thought I&#x27;d try the lotion too. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed! I rubs in smoothly and feels great! Thanks so much for this lotion that I will be buying on a regular basis! Great product!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried every expensive and not-so-expensive cream you can imagine. Carmex, this very unglamourous and relatively inexpensive cream is absolutely amazing. My hands stay smooth, soft and moisturized all day even if I do the dishes...although I do reapply the second half of the day.  It goes quick and absorbs fast. I keep a tube next to the soap at all our sinks so my husband uses it and his hands aren&#x27;t cracked and dry anymore.  I think you&#x27;ll be thrilled with this if you decide to purchase it.</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with this product.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t end up feeling greasy on my hands and allows me to get right back to work after applying it.  It absorbs easily and my hands feel protected for several hours before I need to reapply.  Lacking one star because of the fragrance.  I am not offended by it - but it doesn&#x27;t add to the overall experience.</li>
    <li> I was sent [[ASIN:B0041YMUMM CARMEX HEALING CREAM - for your driest, rough skin, 4.0 oz]] and [[ASIN:B0043CKN3U Carmex Healing Lotion, Aloe+ Vitamin E. 5.5 Oz]] to try out and I&#x27;m hooked! I use the healing lotion every day as part of my morning routine. On really cold days or in very dry areas, I apply some healing cream (which is a bit thicker) before bed. Neither the lotion nor the cream is greasy, and they both absorb nicely into the skin leaving it feeling soft and smelling great. The scents are quite pleasant and the scent lasts for hours.If you don&#x27;t like scents this may not be the right choice for you.  I happen to love it!   These great lotions come in 1 oz. travel sizes as well- perfect for keeping in your pocketbook, and they sell for about 99 cents!  My husband loves them too and I&#x27;ve caught him using it quite a few times.  I was sent these lotions to review on my blog Because Cheaper is Better.</li>
    <li> What is this amazing hand cream!? I love it. A lot of products that say they&#x27;re non-greasy don&#x27;t usually mean that. While this Carmex Healing Cream really means non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using this when I try to use anything else all other products just feel wrong. This one you can feel soothing and moisturizing your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy I found this product. I know I have tons of other creams and lotions in my home but this is the one I carry with me to and from work and it&#x27;s the one I&#x27;m always looking for and dreaming of when I use something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really does work on my driest, toughest skin.</li>
    <li> Best hand cream out there.  Feels like it&#x27;s gonna stay greasy, then it absorbs and it makes your hands sooo soft!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  It healed my severely cracked hands overnight, and makes a waterproof barrier.  Great for winter skin, and it now comes in unscented, I discovered.</li>
    <li> My skin gets really dry in the colder months so I always need a little more moisture. This cream is wonderful - it is not greasy and has a similar scent to the lipbalm that I also love. I like that I can use it on my hands/cuticles at work and it doesn&#x27;t grease up my keyboard/mouse. It seals in moisture and provides longer lasting softness than other products I use.    On a sidenote, I really appreciate that Carmex does not test on animals.</li>
    <li> I love Carmex chapstick, so when the company produced their line of lotion I was ecstatic. I&#x27;m a nurse so that should tell you how my hands may look and feel, so I need a lotion that goes above and beyond its call of duty. This lotion is non greasy, smells great and is a great moisturizer...just wish they would come out with a bigger volume of it and in a hand pump form. But for now, my hands are grateful.</li>
    <li> I started using this cream last winter, and it was the only product that worked for my dry hands.  As an added bonus, my nails are so much stronger and healthier from using this just once in the morning.  I will keep buying this product as long as they make it! It has a light pleasant scent, and it&#x27;s never greasy.</li>
    <li> i always buy this hand cream, is really great for dry skin.  not greasy at all.  highly recommended.  thanks very much.</li>
    <li> This truely is an outstanding cream! I&#x27;ve been using it daily for several months now. LOVE IT! It is completely non-greasy, and it is light weight - not heavy at all. I have psoriatic arthritis and my fingers crack open. Of course, this does not prevent my condition, but it does help. I use a 1-inch strip of cream at each application, and it takes maybe 10 seconds to be completely absorbed ... don&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s there (except hands feel fabulous and very soft). No greasy residue at all (no smudges on my phone screen for instance). It seems to stay with you, and even somewhat after washing your hands.  The scent is not bad at all.  It is very light and gone within a moment or two. So, here&#x27;s the problem... I can no longer find it anywhere!  My local WalMart(s) is no longer carrying it in their stores and neither is Target.  I confirmed with Carmex that this cream is not being discontinued.  I now purchase at Walgreens, although it is more expensive.</li>
    <li> This lotion caused me to break out in hives on my hands and arms. Also on my chin from resting on my hand. Red bumps everywhere this lotion touched.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Made my hands quit cracking after one day.  Non-greasy too!!!  Try it you will love it I promise :)</li>
    <li> I am a 37 yr old female using my boyfriends acct.also and I just wanted to say here that this product is great.For my skin type anyhow,which is very dry on the feet and hands cracks on my knuckle bends in winter,and chaps from constant handwashing because I do culinary things.I simply cannot stand lotions that feel wet,slimy,sticky or greasy after application. This lotion soaks in fast and within a min.it is no longer wet yet I can still feel it tingle ever so slightly as if it had a very mild cooling sensation which I am just obsessed with.I also love the scent,which reminds me of childhood using Carmex items,(and the bright yellow package makes me happy)\armex Company has kept its excellence over the years and still stays a quality company.The \\&quot;cream\\&quot; version feels thicker and helps very dry skin like hands. The \\&quot;lotion\\&quot;version is good for slightly dry skin and everyday body useage.Theyboth smell like a very mild tinge of the smell that Carmex itself has also,and sure does feel like its working,and I enjoy the fact that after it dries skin feels a bit dry.Others have said they do not,however it isnt actually drier,its better inside.but outside surface feels almost powdery but not unpleasantly so.I fear Carmex will quit making this product if it isnt selling well in stores,and stores have told me its on clearance.This is too good not to sell well in my opinion. If it is still made I will buy online forever if possible.No other lotion feels like this,no grease,no smearing on my smartphone screen,feels soothing. Five stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the Carmex Replenishing Cream. It was more than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AJ</li>
    <li> I have had several dry, scaly, itchy, bumpy patches on my hands for about a year. At first I thought they were hives from some allergen, but they stayed and stayed. Then they became scaly and really itchy and really UGLY. After much research, I thought it must be eczema, though I did not get it diagnosed by a doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried SO many creams, including expensive eczema creams. Nothing cleared it up. The best result I got from anything was that it itched a little less. I thought it must be something else, so was thinking about finally going to a dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I got a tube of Carmex Healing Cream and starting using it. Yes, it is nice and non-greasy. I can put it on at my desk at work and go right back to working on my computer. It smells okay. The scent is light and does not overpower. And it makes my skin feel nice. Though, I do not have really dry skin, so all lotion makes my skin feel nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a week of daily use, I noticed that the itchy patches on my hands weren&#x27;t so itchy. And they weren&#x27;t so red. I was beyond thrilled! This was the best they had looked in a year. I would have been happy if they stayed at that level as they were less itchy, less red, less scaly and less noticable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they didn&#x27;t. After several weeks, the patches were totally GONE! I could not believe it. I had tried so many things to clear this stuff up and all it took was a half tube of this relatively inexpensive cream. I have found that if I go without using this cream for several days, I can feel a deep itch where the patches were and see them starting to come back, so I won&#x27;t be going without it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what is in it that cleared those patches up, but it did something many, many other creams and lotions would not do. I love it!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hand cream. Helps keep my hands from chapping in the winter and I use it as a night cream for my face. Has a nice vanilla scent.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh. This cream is splendiferous. I have been searching for a while a good cream that works with my skin type. I came across the Carmex skin care healing cream and my search was over. I am so satisfied with this cream. when i apply the cream to my skin becomes revitalized and it keeps my skin moist all day. I am so happy with my purchase and recommend it to anyone who has dry skin. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Thanks Carmex. :-)</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Not greasy and has a pleasant smell.  Great protection from winter&#x27;s dry air.  I recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m crazy about Carmex Chapstick, but this lotion is amazing!!!!!!!! It dries so fast and my skin is baby smooth with no greasy feeling. I have almost gone through the whole tube in about a month! I never use lotion that fast. I&#x27;m so in love with this and I hope it&#x27;s here to stay!!!!!!!!!! I would give it 10 stars if it were a possible rating. Totally worth every penny!!!!!!! You will not regret buying this.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how great this product is one of my favorite things that I don&#x27;t go any where without it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff because it smells sweet like vanilla frosting. Also it absorbs completely which is nice!</li>
    <li> I like this cream for in the car. Absorbs quickly and last a bit. Non greasy so you can still open a door.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, highly recommend</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t praise this healing cream enough! It goes on thick, eliminating dry, rough winter hands and within seconds, is rubbed in and completely non-greasy. I can use my touch device, keyboard or steering wheel right away without worrying about getting things greasy. This is the best skin care product I&#x27;ve run across in a very long time. I only wish it came in a larger tube.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  Truly moisturizes and leaves your skin feeling soft.  Usually scented lotions trigger a migraine, and although this is very scented, it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Carmex lip balm for decades so when I found this on a store shelf, I snatched it up.  I have psoriasis on my hands and feet and find this product far more helpful and lasting than the similar product I used to use.  It does a better job of stopping the itching, cracking and discomfort that both my previous cream and the prescription cream costing hundreds that I no longer use.  Unfortunately, Walmart doesn&#x27;t appear to be carrying it anymore. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon at a very reasonable cost. It arrived well-packaged and promptly--just as I used the last dab of my one tube.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion.  It works great.  My only reason for giving it 4 starts is because of the price.  I wish it was around the $6 range including shipping.</li>
    <li> I initially purchased this item at a local CVS out of curiosity since I love the lip products so much. I was so impressed with the product that I went back and purchased two more tubes when they went on sale a couple of weeks later. My local drugstore sells these 4oz tubes for $6.99 regularly, so Amazon&#x27;s current price is a better deal if you are already buying other items and want to add this to a qualifying order. The lotion is thick and creamy, but soaks in almost immediately leaving no greasy feel whatsoever. The scent is so light, it&#x27;s almost an unscented product. I can slather this stuff on and rub it into my cuticles and not have to worry that everything I touch for the next 20 minutes will end up with slime all over it. Since it never fails that as soon as I find a product I&#x27;m in love with, it becomes &#x27;unavailable&#x27;, I&#x27;ll probably stockpile this lotion so I can have soft skin and nice cuticles for the impending zombie apocalypse.</li>
    <li> This is the best healing cream on the market.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it might help my skin to repair some scrapes I got doing sports. It worked well I think, although of course it&#x27;s hard to tell (put it on one arm and not the other?). But I did want to say that it has a pretty strong smell. I don&#x27;t want to give a negative review, it&#x27;s good stuff, but I wish it had no smell.</li>
    <li> I had tried every Diaper Rash cream on the market for my little girl.  When she was slightly red, everything would turn her skin to blisters.  I found this cream on clearance at a store and thought I might try it.  Within one day, it was the best product I had tried in a year.  It&#x27;s now the only thing I will put on her.  Please continue to make this product!  It is my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; for her and my baby on the way!</li>
    <li> Carmex Skin Care Healing Cream has to be the absolute best product of its kind on the market! We use it several times each day - to moisturize, to soften, and of course, to help heal all those little scrapes and cuts that occur from gardening and doing household chores and fix-up projects.</li>
    <li> This works very well on my dry, cracked hands. It has a pleasant scent and I don&#x27;t need to use much for it to cover both my hands. I do wish that it wouldn&#x27;t leave my hands so oily though. I can&#x27;t go back to doing my regular activities with greasy hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again because of its efficacy even though there are some drawbacks.</li>
    <li> During the winter I have to be careful with what I use on my skin as it dries so easily. This year, my heels have become ultra sensitive and chapped so I was looking for a thick protectant to apply at night under socks. In searching, I found this bottle by Carmex; I had no idea they made lotion and yet as a child I frequently used their lip medications so I was familiar with the product. When I found this body lotion the other day, I decided to buy it based on three indications: trust in the brand; the bottle states the ingredients are not tested on animals (an extra plus); and, the scent was wonderful. Later that evening, I tried it and boy, does it wear well. No stickiness and yes, the scent is lovely (kind of cocoa-butter-ish). I wouldn&#x27;t recommend applying it to your face though, the intensity of the lotion doesn&#x27;t feel like it meshes well with the sensitivity of facial skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would give it a shot if you are looking for something that is not tested on animals and yet remains decently priced. :)</li>
    <li> We bought this for my wife.  She swears it works, that her skin much less drier and red when she uses it.  I like the pleasant smell which reminds me of vanilla or marshmallow.  She uses it before we go to sleep at night and I almost always tell her how good she smells.</li>
    <li> This smells fantastic! I am very wary of lotions due to the fact that some are oily even when they advertise being not oily, but this cream truly does replenish the moisture in your skin without being oily. Overall, a great product! :)</li>
    <li> This cream was great for me. I&#x27;d usually use a regular body lotion for my hands, but noticed it was too greasy, and gave me that gross sweatiness from over-moisturization. This cream was rich, but void of oiliness, meaning that I only needed a small dab, and it was enough to moisturize my hands just the right amount. What&#x27;s also great about this is that it&#x27;s so portable, and doesn&#x27;t look weird taken out in the middle of class or a meeting if you need to apply it mid-day. I also enjoy the scent, as it&#x27;s not overwhelming, but still nice. I feel this product will last me quite a while, too, as I need so little of it to moisturize my hands properly.</li>
    <li> Love this cream!  It does a great job and is not greasy.  The smell is awesome.  I have purchased before, and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I like thi sas i have really dry hands always, I garden, do dishes and just everyday wear and tear on my hands.  This is the best thing I have found for healing and smoothing without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> Great price on these tubs of cream--LOVE this stuff!</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and it&#x27;s great for this. I use it atleast once a day for keeping them from cracking.</li>
    <li> I love this cream, it works! Smells great, non greasy, love it. I keep it in my car and the heat and cold do not seem to bother it&#x27;s efficacy. No greasy steering wheel.</li>
</ol>
