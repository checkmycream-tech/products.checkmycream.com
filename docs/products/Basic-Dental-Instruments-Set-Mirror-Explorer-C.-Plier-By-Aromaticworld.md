    <li> great purchase. I have used it and it works as expected.I would recumbent this to my friends and this looking for this item.</li>
    <li> The Basic Dental Instruments including pick, tweezers and mirror was in new condition when arrived.  I had a wisdom tooth pulled and needed to irrigate but couldn&#x27;t see where to irrigate so used the mirror to assist.  They work how I need them to work.</li>
    <li> Great price for the minimal tool set but more than adequat dental tool set for any exploration and minor plaque scraping needed.</li>
    <li> The set I received was filthy and rusting. I don&#x27;t know if I got a rare defective product since the reviews for this item were so positive, but I would recommend steering clear of this set.</li>
    <li> Since I took a correspondence course in Do-It-Yourself Dentistry, these tools have made my life more thrifty. The scarring and bleeding are transient if you are a good healer.</li>
    <li> Great if used properly. Ask a professional hygienist.</li>

    <li> So far the quality on these seems to be solid. They feel sturdy and are pretty sharp. The kit has all the basics to perform your own personal cleaning. Overall, great price and quality seems good. The only reason for four stars instead of four is that I am still evaluating the quality.</li>
    <li> the mirror is too small. I don&#x27;t care for it that much</li>
    <li> Unexpetantly good quality. It has allowed me to do some of my own dental scaling to save dental hygenist costs.</li>

    <li> Good product for the price. Arrived on time</li>
    <li> The probes and mirror are well made, but the tweezers are rather flimsy</li>
