      <li>Glad to find this product as it is an &amp;#34;old time&amp;#34; product.</li>
      <li>Better to have and not need, than to need and not have.</li>
      <li>While I like liquid styptic as well, I find that the styptic pencil seems to do a better job stopping &amp;#34;larger&amp;#34; bleeds.</li>
      <li>this might be my favorite purchase.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>Works fine.</li>
      <li>Great to use with a safety razor because they are so sharp and you can easily be cut!</li>
      <li>Bits of facial tissue are not an attractive solution.  </li>
      <li>Would recommend getting better razor blades to prevent knicks in the first place though.</li>
      <li>Good overall experience</li>
      <li>It is nice to have this stick handy to stop the bleeding of the little razor nicks.</li>
      <li>I also use it on my dog&#x27;s nails if I ever hit the quick.</li>
      <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do quickly, it was delivered in a timely manor.</li>

      <li>Small size ideal for travel.</li>
      <li>I found exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>Exactly what i was looking for!</li>
      <li>Great for stopping little nicks while shaving.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately, I rarely ever use this.</li>
      <li>the stinging for 5 seconds is well worth the improvement of my looks sans-bloody paper towel.</li>
      <li>Yes, it stings, but it&#x27;s well worth it.  </li>
      <li>I remember the first time I saw my dad use a styptic pencil, I was blown away.</li>
      <li>Clubman not only offers a wide variety of Styptic Pencils in quantity at an excellent price, their products have the quality you would expect!</li>
      <li>Styptic pencil works exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>I had clubman styptic pencils before and they were thicker, though I&#x27;m not dissapointed will be coming back for more</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little messy to use, but works great!</li>
      <li>If you get nicked as much as I do while shaving, this is all you need.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m about to learn to use a straight razor for Saturday morning head shaving for my husband (his request, wish me luck).  </li>
      <li>I guess inflation really hits everything.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t need it often -- but really need it when you do.</li>
      <li>Works really well to stop bleeding from shave nicks.</li>
      <li>If you nick yourself while straight razing or with any razor for that matter, these pencils are great.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>If you cut yourself shaving much, and you don&#x27;t know about styptic, get one of these.  </li>
      <li>Does the job, stops bleeding fast.</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast.  </li>
      <li>It rinses clean in water and stores in a plastic container that keeps it ready for the next cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Stings like crazy but gets the job done every time - very handy to have!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Summary: Stops small bleeds quick and easy.</li>
      <li>Yea, I was like 7 years old, but it was amazing at the time to see him stop a little bleed on his chin in seconds.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend doing business with this vendor.</li>
      <li>This one comes in a little plastic container (which my previous pencil did not), which is great for protecting it during travel.</li>
      <li>, I used it several times when I first started using my Safety Razor.</li>
      <li>A bleeding dog can make a huge mess.</li>
      <li>and they only carry the large size.  </li>
      <li>Did not like the wasted huge amount of plastic.</li>
      <li>An old fashioned remedy for shaving nicks that beats a scrap of stuck-on tissue.  </li>
      <li>The cut was so dry it was almost as if I had never been bleeding in the first place.</li>
      <li>If the old one lasted 12 years, I&#x27;m sure this will last at least 6 years.</li>
      <li>On the rare occasion when you nick yourself while shaving, the styptic pencil will quickly stop the bleeding and it looks a lot better than a bloody piece of toilet paper stuck to your face!</li>
      <li>When this caused me to be late and have to cancel an important meeting, I started to search online for products that could help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I recently had several nicks and cuts from shaving, and washing my face with exfoliates (I seem to have soft skin), that were just superficial surface tears in my skin, but would not just stop bleeding!</li>
      <li>This product costs next to nothing, stops the bleeding fast, and will last a long time.</li>
      <li>Blood thinning medication has the potential to make you bleed and this is a quick cure for a small neck or cut.</li>
      <li>I use a safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut my face horribly at least once every other month, the kind of cuts that will take 2 hours to coagulate and paper towels don&#x27;t help do anything other than sop up blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Once available in any drug store, this is a tough thing to find in the stores now.  </li>

<li> But does stop those minor nicks and cuts from bleeding immediately.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m talking of dabbing at these cuts with tissues for like 1 hour and still having them bleed and bleed for that long.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Anything that keeps me from bleeding works great for me.  :-)</li>
    <li> I should have bought one of these years ago. Stops bleeding very quickly allowing me to head in to work.</li>
    <li> Styptic pencil works exactly as advertised. Comes in a plastic holder so you have an easy place to store it between uses. Would recommend getting better razor blades to prevent knicks in the first place though.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I never had one of these before. I don&#x27;t nick myself often, but before I had this, it was a big pain to make the bleeding stop. This thing is a lifesaver, and will probably last me ten years. Awesome purchase.I also use it on my dog&#x27;s nails if I ever hit the quick.</li>
    <li> Purchased along with safety razor for my husband.</li>
    <li> Last time I purchased a stypic stick it cost under a dollar. I guess inflation really hits everything. This product is the same manufacturer as the old one, but half the size. (didn&#x27;t want to pay twice the cost for a bigger one, when this size will do) If the old one lasted 12 years, I&#x27;m sure this will last at least 6 years. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and that&#x27;s the best I can say. Just a bit thrown at the inflation in cost. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do quickly, it was delivered in a timely manor.</li>
    <li> Good overall experience</li>
    <li> I recently had several nicks and cuts from shaving, and washing my face with exfoliates (I seem to have soft skin), that were just superficial surface tears in my skin, but would not just stop bleeding! I&#x27;m talking of dabbing at these cuts with tissues for like 1 hour and still having them bleed and bleed for that long. When this caused me to be late and have to cancel an important meeting, I started to search online for products that could help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short story, this stuff works swiftly and wonderfully! I had a nick on my nose that had started to bleed, and applied this product to the affected area. Within literally 1 minute, the bleeding stopped entirely. The cut was so dry it was almost as if I had never been bleeding in the first place. It stung a bit when I applied it, but that to me is not a downside, rather that shows that the product is working and besides, I&#x27;d rather take a few seconds of stinging pain and complete ending of the bleeding so that you can get on with your business for the day, than having to stand in front of the bathroom mirror with a tissue for an hour trying to deal with a stupid cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product, my only regret is that I hadn&#x27;t known about it sooner.</li>
    <li> Husband ver happy,with it</li>
    <li> Stops nicks as advertised. Simply wet the tip and press onto the affected area and the bleeding stops. Recommended for razor shavers.</li>
    <li> The size is perfect!  I have been looking for this size in local drug stores, etc. for several years and they only carry the large size.  This size will last for years as I have had others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for Styptic Pencils forever and almost thought they were a &amp;#34;thing of the past&amp;#34;! Once I put my &amp;#34;thinking cap&amp;#34; on and looked on Amazon (Which I should have done from the beginning) I found exactly what I wanted! Clubman not only offers a wide variety of Styptic Pencils in quantity at an excellent price, their products have the quality you would expect! I purchased 2 Clubman Styptic Pencils because I was so happy to find them. Once opened, these Styptic Pencils will last a VERY long time. I can keep one in my husband&#x27;s medicine cabinet and put the other in his travel bag, so he&#x27;s never without one. Excellent product for an excellent price! Thank you Clubman!</li>
    <li> It leaves a funky residue on the counter top.</li>
    <li> It is nice to have this stick handy to stop the bleeding of the little razor nicks.</li>
    <li> I bought this to be proactive if I ever cut my dog&#x27;s nails to the quick. A bleeding dog can make a huge mess. I&#x27;ve also used it on myself for a few shaving nicks, it works immediately and only stings a little.</li>
    <li> Working well, as advertised.</li>
    <li> this might be my favorite purchase. Girls, invest in one, it&#x27;ll save your legs and save you a lot of time.</li>
    <li> An old fashioned remedy for shaving nicks that beats a scrap of stuck-on tissue.  I&#x27;m about to learn to use a straight razor for Saturday morning head shaving for my husband (his request, wish me luck).  I may need this.</li>
    <li> Works great and it&#x27;s a perfect travel size</li>
    <li> Does the job, stops bleeding fast.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly as described and fits and works perfectly. Order processing, shipping, packaging were all excellent. I highly recommend doing business with this vendor.</li>
    <li> Glad to find this product as it is an &amp;#34;old time&amp;#34; product. Works really well to stop bleeding from shave nicks.</li>
    <li> Once available in any drug store, this is a tough thing to find in the stores now.  On the rare occasion when you nick yourself while shaving, the styptic pencil will quickly stop the bleeding and it looks a lot better than a bloody piece of toilet paper stuck to your face!</li>
    <li> Works very well. Had a nick and this took care of it very effectively.</li>
    <li> It stops bleeding.  There ya go.</li>
    <li> Just your basic styptic pencil here, nothing fancy. I bought it to carry around in my purse because I&#x27;m on anticoagulant therapy and a friend recommended it for just in case moments. It&#x27;s saved me a few times!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Travel&amp;#34; size works well since it is used infrequently.</li>
    <li> Fortunately, I rarely ever use this. Occasionally, I&#x27;ll get a small nick when shaving and this stops it immediately. Not much to say other than to agree with the other reviewer who said &amp;#34;if you suck at shaving, you need this&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little messy to use, but works great!</li>
    <li> But does stop those minor nicks and cuts from bleeding immediately. Better to have and not need, than to need and not have.</li>
    <li> Excellent product at a great price with timely delivery.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband because drug stores in our area seem to have stopped carrying styptic pencils.  The price was good, and I got free shipping.  Works well.</li>
    <li> Came in one piece and it&#x27;s the best styptic pencil ever!</li>
    <li> I had clubman styptic pencils before and they were thicker, though I&#x27;m not dissapointed will be coming back for more</li>
    <li> If you get nicked as much as I do while shaving, this is all you need.  Not only does it seal the wound, but it removes the sight of blood, helping your face and neck look smoother and not like a connect-the-dots book.  Yes, it stings, but it&#x27;s well worth it.  Great value for the price, and Clubman is a name you can trust.</li>
    <li> Great for stopping the bleeding of cuts. Kind of chalky taste.</li>
    <li> Very handy!  Exactly what i was looking for!</li>
    <li> Great for stopping little nicks while shaving.  It does sting a bit, but nothing too bad.</li>
    <li> Works, but gets messy when wet and takes a while to dry.</li>
    <li> Works great most of the time.</li>
    <li> I use a safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut my face horribly at least once every other month, the kind of cuts that will take 2 hours to coagulate and paper towels don&#x27;t help do anything other than sop up blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning.. I cut my face. I drove to work holding paper towel against my chin.  I stopped at the local store... found one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two words: Miracle. Product.  I now don&#x27;t look like a moron holding bloody paper to my face.  the stinging for 5 seconds is well worth the improvement of my looks sans-bloody paper towel.</li>
    <li> Perfect for shaving cuts.</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES these. Hurts when applied but does the trick especially for those little razor cuts</li>
    <li> I picked this up for a good price and the pencil does what it is supposed to. The only negative about this product is that the red cap on the tube is a bit difficult to take off.</li>
    <li> If you cut yourself shaving much, and you don&#x27;t know about styptic, get one of these.  The short version - hold it against the shaving cut and it&#x27;ll sting like hell for a moment or two but the blood will stop seeping out.  Anyone who&#x27;s stood in front of a mirror, already late, dabbing at a razor cut knows that it sucks, so the stinging isn&#x27;t that big of a deal.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything to stop razor cuts from bleeding.  Bits of facial tissue are not an attractive solution.  It was after inadvertently leaving a piece of tissue on my face that someone at work mentioned a styptic pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW.  I am sold.  It will probably last a lifetime - even if I use it on minor cuts all over my body.  I simply dab the pencil on the cut, and the bleeding stops in no time at all.  It rinses clean in water and stores in a plastic container that keeps it ready for the next cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t tried one, please do.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped, but, I am on a daily aspirin, so that may be the cause of it not working as well as hoped.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t need it often -- but really need it when you do.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> It works well, I used it several times when I first started using my Safety Razor.</li>
    <li> Blood thinning medication has the potential to make you bleed and this is a quick cure for a small neck or cut.</li>
    <li> These have worked for years and years. My grandpa even used to use them. Just one of those necessities for the medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> Always wondered if this worked and thought about getting one.&lt;br /&gt;Wish I had not procrastinated. Product works great!!!</li>
    <li> Have used it only once.  It stopped the bleeding promptly and is appropriate in size and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and will save your face when you nic it!</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly.  Well packaged.  Small size ideal for travel.</li>
    <li> Makes my cuts stop bleeding. Everyone should have one of these.</li>
    <li> I discovered that using this product stops the bleeding. It also seems to lengthen the healing time of the cut. I tried it several times and I&#x27;d be with a sore on my face for a week. I stopped using it and the same type of injury (shaving cuts) would be gone in a couple days. Hmmm.....</li>
    <li> I remember the first time I saw my dad use a styptic pencil, I was blown away. Yea, I was like 7 years old, but it was amazing at the time to see him stop a little bleed on his chin in seconds. If you&#x27;re the type who likes to stick tissue on your face, it&#x27;s time to move on up. Just wet the styptic, rub on the bleed for a few seconds, let it dry (takes a few seconds), then wash off and you&#x27;re good to go. While I like liquid styptic as well, I find that the styptic pencil seems to do a better job stopping &amp;#34;larger&amp;#34; bleeds. This one comes in a little plastic container (which my previous pencil did not), which is great for protecting it during travel. Can&#x27;t beat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: Stops small bleeds quick and easy. Must have for shavers.</li>
    <li> excellent product, A+</li>
    <li> If you nick yourself while straight razing or with any razor for that matter, these pencils are great.&lt;br /&gt;Just beware, they do sting when first applied, but it works great.</li>
    <li> Works fine. Just like I remember from years ago.</li>
    <li> Tough to get excited by a styptic pencil.This works well,does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t count the number of times this product has saved my face from careless nicks I sometimes get while shaving......It&#x27;s a necessity just like the razor and the blade.</li>
    <li> Very good. Saves me lots of time rather than have to hold a tissue to stop the bleeding.</li>
    <li> This styptic pencil works great to stop bleeding from razor nicks.  It stings just a little, but that let&#x27;s you know it is working.  Love it and recommend it to men and women!!</li>
    <li> Great to use with a safety razor because they are so sharp and you can easily be cut!</li>
    <li> Works great, perfect travel size</li>
    <li> Did not like the wasted huge amount of plastic. Could&#x27;ve been sent in a small mailer. Also I did not like the dispenser. There is none. It&#x27;s just a stick of styptic pencil in a plastic capped tube. I&#x27;d rather it be in some sort of dispenser.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine. Wish it were like chap stick in that you can open/close it without making a big mess.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast.  Excellent quality.</li>
    <li> Stings like crazy but gets the job done every time - very handy to have!</li>
    <li> Works....  what else can you say.</li>
    <li> Works great, just as everyone describes.</li>
    <li> What can you say about a Styptic Pencil. When you cut yourself while shaving, it stop the blood. These things last a &amp;#34;lifetime&amp;#34;, it just that somehow I have lost mine on some trip; so I had to buy another.</li>
    <li> works as advertised - like that it comes in a re-usaable storage tube!</li>
    <li> Perfect size for travel/gym bag. If you shave,  you&#x27;re going to get nicked from time to time. This product costs next to nothing, stops the bleeding fast, and will last a long time.</li>
