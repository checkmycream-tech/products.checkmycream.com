### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The best advice I would give to anyone thinking of trying this product... DON&#x27;T!     </li>
      <li>It does what it claims it will do and it feels wonderful when you put it on.</li>
      <li>lol  </li>
      <li>I have seen ads for this product and was happy to have a chance to try it for free.     </li>
      <li>Honestly after 2 DAYS I saw results.</li>
      <li>I finally ordered this product from Amazon, no problem, very easy, and it is wonderful!</li>
      <li>Works OK.  </li>
      <li>Maybe gets better over time.</li>
      <li>Will resume using...........Will be able to make a better review when all is gone</li>
      <li>The advertisements sure made me believe it.&lt;br /&gt;The cream did absolutely NOTHING.  </li>
      <li>I may not have paid for this, but let me tell you, free isn&#x27;t exactly the word I would use to describe my experience with Hydroxatone Hydrolyze.</li>
      <li>She said I should ask for my money back becuase it sure wasn&#x27;t working!</li>
      <li>People tell me I look younger and more rested!  </li>
      <li>If your circles are hereditary like mine are, I would just try to find a more natural alternative, like tanning or vitamins.</li>
      <li>Use in combination with good rest, drinking plenty of water and all the other &amp;#34;healthy suggestions&amp;#34</li>
      <li>so I knew immediately that the color didn&#x27;t look right</li>
      <li>It is a great product and I highly recommend it for people who struggle with dark circles under their eyes.</li>
      <li>I bought this because there are an overwhelming number of options that target specific areas.</li>
      <li>Definitely makes the skin more moist.  </li>
      <li>That should&#x27;ve been my first indication that there was a problem.</li>
      <li>It is not cheap but it is worth it, Enjoy!!</li>
      <li>This prouduct actually works and it is easy to order it on amazon.</li>
      <li>Every time I tryed to go to check out it would send me back to the original page.</li>
      <li>But you live and you learn.</li>
      <li>I ran across this product and tried it because of all the great reviews, placed my order, followed all the instructions and just as I thought, epic fail.</li>
      <li>The product arrived on time, properly sealed and packaged, and the item was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>I told my sister excitedly that I was trying a new dark circle reducer.</li>
      <li>I originally purchased this for dark eye circles.  </li>
      <li>My eyes now have a rough texture and mild scarring in these areas, in addition to the tenderness and inflammation, and it&#x27;s been nearly two weeks since I used the product.</li>
      <li>The product is listed on fda.gov as being considered for regulatory action by the FDA for the promotion of unapproved drugs in the US and misbranding.</li>
      <li>All products have risks, even candy bars have warnings on them that say \\&quot;this product may contain traces of nuts\\&quot; forcrying out loud.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m only 27 years old, but I have recently begun to see the first signs of aging around my eyes.</li>
      <li>I developed a constant tearing in one of my eyes about two weeks after using it...  </li>
      <li>Within a week, I noticed a major decline of the tiny wrinkles around my eyes.  </li>
      <li>This does sting a little at first but the sting does stop when a moisturizer applied before using and after.</li>
      <li>I used this product for 6 months and it did absolutely nothing for my dark circles.  </li>
      <li>I find that this product really does help with the dark shadows under my eyes.</li>
      <li>but this product works very well in making them significantly less noticeable.</li>

<li> That doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t risks, it simply means that they haven&#x27;t disclosed them.</li>
<li> But none the less, I believe it works.  </li>
<li> This is a serious red flag, ya&#x27;ll!!!     </li>
<li> Returned because instead of being white and fluffy it was thick and yellowish.</li>
<li> and I have seen little to no improvement on my dark circles.</li>
<li> Dark circles still there after a few weeks of use.  </li>

<li> I&#x27;ve tried a few items and all have been a epic fail.</li>
<li> It takes a few weeks before you will see the skin under your eyes change, but you will see it.</li>
<li> I have to massage under my eye and along my nose a few times a day to keep it from watering (which causes puffiness!)</li>
<li> Not sure if the product was faulty or the vender sent me an expired product, but after a month of use</li>
<li> Way to thick a substance.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had serious darks cirlces all my life.</li>
<li> Within 24 hours of using this product, the areas where this product was applied (the eyelids, crow&#x27;s feet, and undereye area) became red, inflammed, and painful to touch.</li>

    <li> What a total waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;I had some discoloration/darkness under my eyes&lt;br /&gt;and thought this was the \\&quot;magic\\&quot; stuff that would&lt;br /&gt;do the trick.  The advertisements sure made me believe it.&lt;br /&gt;The cream did absolutely NOTHING.  Don&#x27;t fall for the scam&lt;br /&gt;like I did.[[ASIN:B000TVNIY0 Hydrolyze Under Eye Dark Circles Treatment by Hydroxatone 15 ml (.5 oz)]]</li>
    <li> Works OK.  Definitely makes the skin more moist.  Dark circles still there after a few weeks of use.  Maybe gets better over time.</li>
    <li> I fell for it again.  The marketing hype.  I used this product for 6 months and it did absolutely nothing for my dark circles.  They didn&#x27;t get lighter, they didn&#x27;t disappear. Save your money.</li>
    <li> Way to thick a substance. Got it all over the place except my eye. Finally stopped using it.</li>
    <li> This product works wonders on puffiness under the eyes immediately and I noticed softness in my visible crows feet within days....  But... I have stopped using the product. I developed a constant tearing in one of my eyes about two weeks after using it...  My doctor says I have a clogged tear duct. I have to massage under my eye and along my nose a few times a day to keep it from watering (which causes puffiness!) This may not happen to you, but I will no longer use it.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this for dark eye circles.  Within a week, I noticed a major decline of the tiny wrinkles around my eyes.  Within 2 weeks the dark circles were gone and I continued to see a difference in eye lines, however after not using it for a week the dark circles came back.  SO I just ordered another bottle.!  lol  They got me hooked for life now.</li>
    <li> This prouduct actually works and it is easy to order it on amazon. I tryed to order it from the Hdrolyze web site and could not do it. Every time I tryed to go to check out it would send me back to the original page. Finally I got the phone number and called Hydrolyze customer sevice dept.I ordered over the phone and they never sent me the product. Seriously, how crazy is that?? I finally ordered this product from Amazon, no problem, very easy, and it is wonderful! It takes a few weeks before you will see the skin under your eyes change, but you will see it. It does what it claims it will do and it feels wonderful when you put it on.It is not cheap but it is worth it, Enjoy!!</li>
    <li> I used the entire container of this and didn&#x27;t see any results. I told my sister excitedly that I was trying a new dark circle reducer. She said I should ask for my money back becuase it sure wasn&#x27;t working! Find something else.</li>
    <li> The best advice I would give to anyone thinking of trying this product... DON&#x27;T!     I actually received this product as a part of a gift basket of beauty products. I&#x27;m only 27 years old, but I have recently begun to see the first signs of aging around my eyes. I have seen ads for this product and was happy to have a chance to try it for free.     I may not have paid for this, but let me tell you, free isn&#x27;t exactly the word I would use to describe my experience with Hydroxatone Hydrolyze. I would give it 0 stars if I could!    #1: This product burns when you apply it. Over the counter products that are applied around your eyes shouldn&#x27;t burn like that. That should&#x27;ve been my first indication that there was a problem. If you look at the reviews, this seems to be everyone&#x27;s experience with Hydroxatone Hydrolyze.     Within 24 hours of using this product, the areas where this product was applied (the eyelids, crow&#x27;s feet, and undereye area) became red, inflammed, and painful to touch. My eyes now have a rough texture and mild scarring in these areas, in addition to the tenderness and inflammation, and it&#x27;s been nearly two weeks since I used the product. NOTHING ELSE in my beauty regimen has changed!     Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t read the reviews before I used it - I now wish I had.    #2: This prodcut is not FDA approved. This means that it has not been evaluated for safety and effectiveness. I did some research on the FDA&#x27;s website, and on June 29, 2011 imports of Hydroxatone were being detained by the FDA. The product is listed on fda.gov as being considered for regulatory action by the FDA for the promotion of unapproved drugs in the US and misbranding. This is a serious red flag, ya&#x27;ll!!!     #3: There aren&#x27;t ANY warnings at all in the packaging for this product. That doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t risks, it simply means that they haven&#x27;t disclosed them. All products have risks, even candy bars have warnings on them that say \\&quot;this product may contain traces of nuts\\&quot; forcrying out loud. So that should&#x27;ve been my next indication that there may be a problem.    As a woman, I&#x27;ve tried tons of products in an effort to \\&quot;fix\\&quot; my inperfections, but sometimes this quest can be costly and damaging. But you live and you learn. I&#x27;m heading to the doctor today to see if there is anything that can be done to reverse the damage that this product has caused.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time, properly sealed and packaged, and the item was exactly as described. I find that this product really does help with the dark shadows under my eyes.</li>
    <li> Used for a month and noticed some lightening...........Will resume using...........Will be able to make a better review when all is gone</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time and I swear by it.  People tell me I look younger and more rested!  It is a great product and I highly recommend it for people who struggle with dark circles under their eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had serious darks cirlces all my life. I&#x27;ve tried a few items and all have been a epic fail. I ran across this product and tried it because of all the great reviews, placed my order, followed all the instructions and just as I thought, epic fail. I guess I will continue to look like a raccoon</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have ever found that actually lightens dark circles, the added benefit is the softening of the wrinkles too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for almost a month now and I have seen little to no improvement on my dark circles. If your circles are hereditary like mine are, I would just try to find a more natural alternative, like tanning or vitamins.</li>
    <li> I will not use this vender or recommend it!  Not sure if the product was faulty or the vender sent me an expired product, but after a month of use I&#x27;m seeing no improvement!</li>
    <li> Returned because instead of being white and fluffy it was thick and yellowish. I&#x27;ve been buying this product for 2 years so I knew immediately that the color didn&#x27;t look right</li>
    <li> I used this. I did not see results until week five. This does sting a little at first but the sting does stop when a moisturizer applied before using and after.</li>
    <li> There is no miracle cure for my very dark circles  but this product works very well in making them significantly less noticeable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used prescriptives, Clinique and Lancôme.  I bought this because there are an overwhelming number of options that target specific areas. Honestly after 2 DAYS I saw results. I didn&#x27;t know if it was the pigments in the cream or if it was my mind playing tricks on me. But none the less, I believe it works.  Use in combination with good rest, drinking plenty of water and all the other &amp;#34;healthy suggestions&amp;#34; that are out there.</li>
