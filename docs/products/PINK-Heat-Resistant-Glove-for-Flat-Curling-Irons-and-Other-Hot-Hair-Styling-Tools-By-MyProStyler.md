      <li>I would not try to hold the curling iron with the glove due to how hot the iron gets but it will protects your fingers from getting burned.</li>
      <li>glove fit my hand very well and goes up a little past my wrist.</li>

<li> glove is a pink heat resistant glove for flat/curling irons.</li>
<li> This also means that I spent less time doing my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> If you have small hands this glove might be loose on you.</li>
<li> No more accidental burns...</li>

<li> But my hands are too small for it. :(</li>
<li> It was basically a knit glove, HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It serves it purpose. I also love the fact that I was able to choose colors</li>
    <li> I was trying to roll hair on hair rollers with these.  I have medium size hands but the fingers on the gloves were too long.  They would probably have worked better if they had it my fingers better.  They are probably worth a try if you have long fingers, but because they didn&#x27;t fit me I couldn&#x27;t hold onto the hair.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really resist heat honestly, just kind of makes it bearable so you don&#x27;t instantly get burned :P</li>
    <li> This glove is the best! I will never use another glove with my curling wand ever again. It doesn&#x27;t melt to the wand and you can actually hold your hair on the wand for about 30 seconds before it stings.</li>
    <li> It worked wonderfully</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t as excepted</li>
    <li> If you are like me and ALWAYS burn yourself, you must get one of these! My favorite curling iron doesn&#x27;t have the end cap that doesn&#x27;t get hot and I reach up to grab it at least 10 times while doing my hair. Never fails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glove fit my hand very well and goes up a little past my wrist. I have burned my wrist before so I like that it has a little extra length. It is thick but I can still feel what I am grabbing. Although, it was weird at first, I quickly got the hang of using it. It performed exactly how I expected it to. I was much more comfortable and effective while wearing this because I wasn&#x27;t constantly worried about burning my hand. This also means that I spent less time doing my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: This is not intended to be used to grab and hold your straightener or curling iron by the plate/barrel. This is to prevent burns from the times that you accidentally touch your hand. If you are expecting to hold the plates of your styler with this, your expectations are too high.&lt;br /&gt;*Product received at a discount for review purposes.</li>
    <li> I was not satisfied at all with this glove. I could have used a regular glove because that&#x27;s what it is.</li>
    <li> Do not recommend purchasing this for using with a curling rod, AT ALL. I was burned through the glove. It was basically a knit glove, HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED.</li>
    <li> No more accidental burns...great idea.</li>
    <li> I wanted a better glove then the one that came free with my curling rod. This one worked very well for me. I received one pink heat resistant glove. The material does look like a normal non heat resistant mitten, which made me skeptical at first. However, I have not gotten burned since using this glove. I also love the pink color. Compared to a black glove, it is much easier to see where my hand is while styling my hair. I would definitely buy this item again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long fingers and this glove fits me. If you have small hands this glove might be loose on you.</li>
    <li> Not very heat resistant</li>
    <li> Glove works perfectly, and  because it is pink, I can find it easily.</li>
    <li> hard to use while wearing</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Does not protect your hand from touching a curling iron, its actually just like a regular glove. perfect for just not buring your hand on freshly pressed hair.</li>
    <li> Its cute. But my hands are too small for it. :(</li>
    <li> I thought it was 2 gloves but only one &amp; its not a heat resistant glove. I burned my finger 3 times since I had it flat ironing my hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect and protects hands from heat</li>
    <li> This item is not really &amp;#34;Heat Resistant&amp;#34;.  I already scorched 2 fingers on the glove which in turn scorched my 2 fingers</li>
    <li> If you are like me,you have burned your hands or fingers a hundred times using your curling iron.It seems like the more careful that I am the more I burn myself. When I was given the opportunity to test and review this glove for my unbiased opinion I was excited to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My glove is a pink heat resistant glove for flat/curling irons. I love the color, it is so bright and pretty and fits well.&lt;br /&gt;I like using this glove when I am using the curling iron to prevent getting burn again. It helps protects my fingers and leaves me with more time concentrating on curling my hair instead of worrying about burning myself. I would not try to hold the curling iron with the glove due to how hot the iron gets but it will protects your fingers from getting burned. This is a great product for help protecting your fingers and hands!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:5a56f122272d788376856e47e79b53f4]]Ok these are great!  they are the definite must have for those of us who repeatedly burn our selves picking up that hair to either curl or straighten.  they would even be great for the ones who use the hot rollers.  I like to straighten my hair and am always grabbing hot hair and saying ouch or worse if I am alone in the house...lol! They take a min to get used to but in the end they save your fingers and hands.  Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recevied this product for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Love it great product will defiantly order again if needed.</li>
