<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Thank you!!! Arrived fast!</li>
    <li> The batch I got of this soap was almost black, and very hard.  The soap I used previous to this was more of the light to dark brown mottled, mixed soap I usually see in pictures.  It doesn&#x27;t mold very easily so I wasn&#x27;t able to press it into the mold I used to make a nice bar shape, but with that said it performs like you expect black soap to perform. Great thick lather and a bit goes a long way. If you don&#x27;t care about the color or being able to mold it easily, this is a great buy. It could just be this batch and the next batch will be different.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t anything like the african black soap that I buy in a local boutique store.  This is dark, crumbly and  messy.  Not a good quality of black soap.  Very disappointing and would not purchase again.  Skip this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for the last 5 years and it works great. This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased it from this vendor. The product arrived on time. I used this soap because my skin is very sensitive and I&#x27;m unable to use any other soap on my skin. I&#x27;ve tried every product out there for sensitive skin with no luck until I tried this product. It make my skin soft and smooth. Other soap&#x27;s tend to hurt and drys my skin out. I would recommend this product. By the way some people complain about this pieces of bark in the product. I wash with a wash scrub, which has a pocket for the soap. It works great.</li>
    <li> This soap has a great lather just trying to make a good shampoo with it but I haven&#x27;t had it for long time so still testing different ways that it will work but it is a good soap</li>
    <li> Nice and organic but you should cut it into bars for your self.</li>
    <li> Love this soap it keeps my face free of black head</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered, so no complaints. I have oily, acne-prone skin and the soap has done a dcent job clearing some areas, but I still have breakouts.</li>
    <li> This is the only soap that I use for my entire family. I love the smell, skin tightness post usage and fresh scent.  Well worth the buy and way cheaper than what people try to sell it to you for at health food stores.  They rip you off!!!  Always buy in bulk!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. Packaging may seem weird if you&#x27;re used to marked up retail western boutique fluff full of fillers, as may the texture. But this stuff is the real deal. It&#x27;s hand made, it&#x27;s tree bark natural, it&#x27;s powerfully medicinal.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t describe how much I LOOOOVVVVEEEE, this soap! I have to get the body wash! It was clean and not too gritty, although I like a little grit because while the soap cleanses the grit exfoliates. A little goes a very long way. The more you wash your skin, the more suds develops. As long as I receive fresh Raw African Black Soap, I will be purchasing it, from this seller anyway.</li>
    <li> No regrets, this is the only soap I use. Cleans well, not hard on your skin.</li>
    <li> my husband and i both enjoy it.</li>
    <li> I was so happy when I found this amount of black soap.  The price was great and this will last me for a while.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I am always skeptical of negative reviews because I tend to think when a product doesn&#x27;t meet expectations that people tend to overreact and judge unfairly.  I have heard that some customers have found foreign hair in their black soap.  I can confirm this.  Not just stray hairs here and there, whole tangles of black hair within the soap.  Absolutely disgusting!  Unbelievable how this happens, but I strongly advise not to purchase from this vendor.  Black soap is not uncommon, and there are plenty of vendors to choose from.  You might not get hair in yours, or you might.  In my opinion, no reason to take chances.  Go somewhere else.</li>
    <li> Quality Product definitely all natural!</li>
    <li> OK I know what all the fuss is about now. I will keep this in my line of soap products. I can make a nice paste for washing your face it is sooo nice. I have read where people say it is drying - but I&#x27;ve not had that problem. I cleans well and softens my skin and when I sell it I always get comments about how wonderful it is and the return orders says to me that there is something good about it. I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and I don&#x27;t want to dry out my skin and this doesn&#x27;t. Love it I have. I Think I have ordered 16lbs this week. added to the three lbs I just had finished working with. Business is good.</li>
    <li> I really love this soap.my complexion is much clearer and cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;It has decreased my breakouts tremendously. I also think it keeps me looking younger.I will continue to use this product for ever.</li>
    <li> I have bought other black soaps and this one is way better it&#x27;s more moisturizing and has a softer texture. It&#x27;s all I use!!</li>
    <li> Very good quality soap.</li>
    <li> It took using a few times to get used to smell, which is earthy and a little smokey.  It makes skin smell clean and natural.  This soap is wonderful and very economical.  Great lather.  Keep it dry.  If it gets wet and crumbles you can press back together.  Cleans the skin like nothing else.  I have read the things we put on skin is absorbed into the blood stream in  3 minutes.  We should avoid most soap because of the chemicals and other additives.  It really removes dead skin and heals blemishes.  This soap is plant based and I love it.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied. Thank You.</li>
    <li> GREAT QUALITY!!!! I only wished it came in a single sq or rectangular block vs a few pecies/ half circle</li>
    <li> Love using black soap in almost all my homemade soaps. Most recipes do not give the lather that we like, but adding some black soap pieces and stirring to dissolve improves the lather about 100%. Plus, mixing it into recipes that have more healthy skin oils and aloe vera gel takes care of any dry-skin issues that other users have mentioned. I gave the seller four stars because the block came in just a little under the three pound weight. Personally, I think they should consider the weight of the wrapping and be sure you are getting three pounds of soap and not three pounds of soap with plastic wrap. I handle bulk distributions all the time and am careful to give the customer what they order.</li>
    <li> This is the best soap I ever used, I have oily face and this soap cleans my face and leave it feeling soft, I use it also as my body soap and love it, when I get out the shower I use Shea butter and my skin stay moist the whole day. I would buy this soap again.</li>
    <li> I have a food scale at home, so when I received the black soap I weighted it and was not pleased with the result. The item description says 3LBS, but it actually weights 2.6LBS. Please, be aware of this. I might be the only person experiencing this, but you guys should weight unpacked products once you received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope the seller will read this and will ship me the remainder. Otherwise, I will return the product back to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the product was delivered on time and looks okay. This will be my first time using the African black soap, so will experiment it and will hopefully make a review later on.</li>
    <li> Love love love....what else to say....it is a lot.</li>
    <li> This is a true soap from nature your going to love cleaning yourself with this soap and you can use it around the house as well to clean things</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.  Cons are, Has sharp pieces but they dissolve and my skin is rough ( excema). If you have sensitive skin may want to melt soup add water and shea butter or oil and use it in a liquid form. It does dry my skin but that is the ideal for people with excema. It also leaves a white film like other soaps. Pros are, it clears up excema without leaving ugly dark scars and marks. If you take cooler showers it leaves skin soft (I can&#x27;t stand the cold), There is not a strong smell and ot doesn&#x27;t stain the tub. Smooths stretch marks and evens skin tone with prolong use. All and all i give it 5 stars because the pros out weigh the cons.</li>
    <li> I love the tingly feeling this soap leaves on your skin for the first few seconds you use it! This is perfect for blemishes and make up removal</li>
    <li> great for any skin conditions, awesome for acne, psoriasis, eczema. Lathers wonderfully, easy to cut and easy to store. Great value.</li>
    <li> Really gets you clean.  Smell is getting used too.  Some smaller gritty particles so be careful on face and sensitive areas.  Washes clear and quickly.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my son, so I haven&#x27;t tried it, but if it is anything like what he has used in the past it will be nice.</li>
    <li> Love it! I really feel clean when I use it. I wish there no rough pieces in the soap.</li>
    <li> This raw african black soap is the best ever.  Nice lather.  Feel so clean after using it. Helps with my teenager&#x27;s acne.  So nice being able to but in bulk and have it when I need it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay soap.  When I opened it I thought it was a hoax based on the way it looks.  It does not have a remarkable smell but it&#x27;s not completely unpleasant tto sniff. It doesn&#x27;t hold upwell in the shower and it looks really really odd (saying that nicely) after it has absorbed somewater, so you probably don&#x27;t want to show it off in your guest bathroom. You can get clean and all but pretty much all soap does that. I gave away about 80% of mine simply because if I&#x27;m going to buy soap online it shoud at least smell really good and not look like someone had an accident in my bathroom.  Sorry - I try to support these kind of products but this one is not ready for the big leagues.</li>
    <li> love this stuff! I will not use anything else on my face &amp; body. Cleared up my adult acne. I also broke out with small itchy bumps on my lower back, I used this soap and then followed it up with shea butter and it cleared it up and never came back.&lt;br /&gt;(still dont know what that was all about)</li>
    <li> My favorite soap for several years</li>
    <li> I  don&#x27;t like to give shipping ratings because sometimes it&#x27;s not the sellers fault, that our postal service is slow.  However, I did get the shipping within a week or so, fast enough for me.  The packaging was well normal I guess, nothing fancy, it was sealed so not a concern to me.&lt;br /&gt;Now the product itself, I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t know about this product until after damaging my facial skin.  I started to suffer from cycst acne and well I am in my 30&#x27;s, I have always had clear skin, people used to complement me on how beautiful my face was, until well I turned 30, not sure why but oh well.  I tried every product on the market and nothing seemed to work. Then I found Raw African Black Soap and all I can say is DAMNNNNN, within a week or so, I stopped breaking out and my old crusty ones just seemed to come off!  I am completely in love with this product! For sure Raw African Soap has replaced my cetaphil soap, toner, makeup remover etc...  My face is looking awesome and my body too! My face was the real problem thou.  I have had people recently say, wow you look so glowy! The smell is an earthy, like if your standing in grass and mud after a long day of rain and the sun pops out and starts to dry up the mud, that smell of of earth..sheeshh I don&#x27;t know but its not a bad smell, I actually really like it, it makes me feel good in some wierd way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, you can use it everyday morning and night, so as long as you use shea butter or shea oil or coconut oil, immediately after.  It will dry up your skin if you don&#x27;t. If it&#x27;s too harsh well skip the morning wash or just wash with water put on some more oil or just wash at night before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is AMAZING, GOODBYE CETAPHIL!</li>
    <li> I love this soap; its the only soap I use. My nephew&#x27;s were over for the weekend and after taking a shower they both said; we like that soap... Kid approved!!! I gave a slice to my niece and she loves it too it cleared up her skin (even body acne)...my husband loves this soap too. He is very picky about what goes on his skin, so when I had a sample of it he was reluctant; after he tried  it..he through out all his soap and said DON&#x27;T BUY ANYTHING BUT THESE.... we love it</li>
    <li> I love my Raw African Black Soap. I mix it with water in a plastic container and it last forever. Speedy delivery!</li>
    <li> Love this African Black soap. It makes my skin soft and removes acne from my face and body. Dark spots are fading, and blemishes, and blackheads are no longer on my body.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  I have been using it for years so I am a regular.  No blemishes on my face and it really helps with acne.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with acne for 7 years and I have tried so many things to clear my skin. I also have some discoloration on my face and body. I&#x27;ve been using this soap on my face and body for almost a month. I really noticed a difference. My face has cleared up dramatically. Still working on the scaring which I know takes time. I love this product so much I gave some to my sister. Her acne has improved as well. She is hooked! The product was shipped quickly. I will surely be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> I love this black soap!!! I use it from head to toe as a bath soap and as a face soap! Great for acne scars and other skin issues. The delivery was prompt !</li>
    <li> So I ordered a 1lb brick and it came molded and extremely hard. I&#x27;m pretty sure it was old. I am glad I wasn&#x27;t in dire need of it because my face would have been very sad and dirty! Lol anywho, let&#x27;s hope they correct it in a timely matter.</li>
    <li> This is a heck of a deal for the money.  But keep in mind that you have to refine it.  There were a few rocks in the soap which is to be expected.</li>
    <li> Doesn’t leave a soapy residue.  I have sensitive skin and tend to react with itchy skin and then I breakout.  I would highly recommend this for all skin types!</li>
    <li> This soap arrives in bulk form much like I used to purchase in Turkey. Just break off a chunk and wet it to mold but it cleans so good. My family use it for everything from cleaning scrapes and bruises to makeup removal. The skin is very soft and smooth afterwards. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Did not do well with my skin.</li>
    <li> the product came the next day and  in one large piece. Family loves the black soap .It makes your skin soft and not dried. I  recommend this anybody.</li>
    <li> this soap has the consistency of a sponge...i would not order again, and am disappointed that i ordered so much</li>
    <li> My skin feels great with this soap, and it&#x27;s great for shaving when you don&#x27;t want to use shaving cream</li>
    <li> It was plenty for the family and package somewhat ok. I say its good  and need to be in individual packages.</li>
    <li> Good quality black soap</li>
    <li> This was my first time ordering and trying African black soap.&lt;br /&gt; I should mention that I have Psoriasis over about 70% of my body and store bought soap, even the stuff for sensitive skin burns and itches me....Ive even had a few types actually cause my skin to bleed.&lt;br /&gt;SO, that is why I decided to try African black soap I read that it can be helpful for Psoriasis..also there&#x27;s no chemicals or fragrances added (those irritate my skin as well).&lt;br /&gt;So..I did a &amp;#34;test patch washing&amp;#34; from my hands to my elbows on both arms when it first came ....NO itching, stinging, burning. I just felt smooth and clean..I will mention that I have Psoriasis on BOTH forearms from wrist to elbow. I did this test twice before using it on my whole body and face.&lt;br /&gt;So far its wonderful...My skin is CLEAN and feels smooth...I have NOT noticed any &amp;#34;stripping&amp;#34; or over drying ...However I do apply shea butter (ordered from smellgood of course) or a body butter I make after bathing. My Psoriasis seem to be smoothing out and less bumpy. Also no scaley hanging around either :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has been using this soap as well, he has those rough bumps on the backs of his arm...those are almost gone after about 4 days of using this soap. He also washes his hair with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap lathers into a creamy lather, and a little goes a LONG way.I will say that the smell is a little different LOL. EARTHY is the best way to describe it. I  find it to be Less strong when actually bathing with it than sniffing it in the bag.&lt;br /&gt;Also this soap is NOT rock hard or dry crumbly its solid but soft I cut and break it easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled to have finally found a soap that I can use that wont hurt my skin/Psoriasis :) I will definitely be ordering again but I think 3lbs of this should last me a good long while !</li>
    <li> This soap is nice and I feel clean, but not dried out after using it. I was hoping for it to help with some of my skin issues (psoriasis and acne) but it hasn&#x27;t helped or harmed that, they remain the same. The smell isn&#x27;t real pleasant, but is so light that you barely notice it and it rinses right off.</li>
    <li> Love the earthy smell and it makes my hair squeaky clean. I use it on my face, as a shampoo for my hair and at times I use it in the shower. Overall, I think the product is excellent.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping and great product.</li>
    <li> I love this soap always leaves me feeling clean especially after spending weeks out in the field during training</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It gets you sooo clean. I can use it on my body and my face (I have oily skin). You get a good amount of soap. When i get it, I wet it a little(to soften it up) and my wet my hands a little and make soap bars. I can make about 14-16 bars. I store them in the top of my closet. It can be drying but I always put on oil or lotion after so thats not a problem. In the summer I can wash my face with this and not put on any moisturizer and be fine. In the winter I find it a little drying and I have to alternate between this and a face wash. But it makes my skin look good all year long. Yes it has little bits in it ( I read that they are hard cocoa pods or something but they look like tiny rocks). Honestly this soap is so wonderful that even if they are little rocks I DONT CARE, lol. Its that good. But you definitely should NOT use the soap directly against your skin because the little particles(rocks/cocoa pods) will scratch your skin. Just lather it up (and a tiny piece will give you a good amount of suds) on your washcloth and enjoy. Its so nice to have something so natural and so effective.</li>
    <li> Its very good. I think its a bit basic, so you would have to follow it up with some toner or if your skin is acne prone tea tree oil is great after this soap. Be careful not to over use as it can be slightly drying. It is also pretty good as a cleaning supply must say !</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this soap. I purchased some this past August, and begged the seller to send it ASAP as I was leaving the country. The seller complied and I left with this delicious product. It is excellent when followed by shea butter. It helps to eradicate acne! Also, I was unable to come home, and my mother was angry for having left and not having left her any of this delicious soap, so I purchased some for Christmas. She loves it too . . . of course, she couldn&#x27;t wait to use it! I can&#x27;t imagine buying black soap from anyone else now.</li>
    <li> Ive been buying this product from this seller from a different site for about a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two particular things that make people think this product is weird and unusable. 1) at solid state it has a strange film on it. Some people who haven&#x27;t done their research describe this film as mold. It is not mold, it is due to water content. 2) there is foreign matter in the soap. This soap is very natural.  Its made with ash and could contain plantains or palms. So the matter makes sense. This soap is very natural. The point is that it isn&#x27;t overly processed and that it doesn&#x27;t contain crazy chemicals. If you DO want a particular substance in it, you have the control to add it in, what kind and how much. Like I added lavender essential oil to some. I added my own essential oil and I added it to the level of fragrance I like!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I make it into a liquid by cutting the soap into smaller chucks, put in a pan and add hot tap water, I stir it around a couple of times and let it soak overnight. In the morning I  stir again and pour off what I can.  With the soap that is in the pot I repeat the process.  With the liquefied soap I strain it thru a cheesecloth. I then store it in whatever empty vesicles I can find such as soda bottles, various glass bottles such as gin, or mason jars. Sometimes I add a few drops of essential oil for a little variation though I do really like ABSs smell,  Also it is said that Vitamin E oil or Grapefruit Seed Oil are natural preservatives.  I&#x27;ve had several bottles of  liquid ABS soap that I leave on the shelf with no signs of spoilage. As I need the soap I pour soap into a pumped container so I can use it easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my face: I splash on some water, rub on some ABS and a smidge of baking soda as a mild exfoliate then rinse off  thoroughly. On my body l use it just like body wash. It has a nice lather but possibly not as much you are used to.&lt;br /&gt;When I first started using ABS I only made the liquid soap when I needed it. Realizing it would be so much easier and less to mess with to just make the whole 3# block all at once.&lt;br /&gt;It also makes a nice hand wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So buy it. You&#x27;ll like it. And if you don&#x27;t, find a hippie or a vegan and give it to them. Or me.</li>
    <li> I love black soap, This came in one big hunk which I like so I can cut to my preferred size. I notice with this as well as using raw shea butter, my exema is almost non existent, my stretch marks are tiny white lines, my scars are virtually gone, and my skin is so soft and smooth and it is a rare occasion for me to have a blemish. I have always had horrible skin and i feel soooo much better about myself. I used to use products full of chemicals and animal by products and now I&#x27;m all natural in my beauty regimen and my skin is amazing! I recommend fully</li>
    <li> With all my respect this product very unacceptable quality, contain very heavy sand/charcoal like residue (a big disappointment, 3ibs of soap go to the garb.).&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I cant recommend Raw African Black Soap from the Seller smellgood. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love this. Bought 1 lb. and just ordered the 3 lb. I make it into liquid by cutting it up and putting it in water with some lavender oil and thicken it a little with guar gum. It&#x27;s a great soap. Very clean. I use it for hand soap, shower gel. You name it. This will last me years! It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry me out like some reviewers have said. I use Shea butter or Castor oil after showering though. Haven&#x27;t tried it as shampoo yet but it&#x27;s the weekend so I&#x27;ll give it a shot.</li>
    <li> nice lather. i melt it into a liquid soap dispenser with shea butter and vitamin e. My skin looks and feels great</li>
    <li> Awesome product that does amazing things for your skin. I wish i knew about African black soap during my oily teenage years.</li>
    <li> The raw black soap is truly and amazing soap and the very first soap i have ever used that worked so well and great for the skin wrinkles and fine lines i will truly continue using this and hope u buyers be as pleased as iam ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank u seller !!</li>
    <li> LOVE this soap! It arrived within a couple of days, tightly wrapped in plastic wrap. I immediately cut it into bars and wrapped each individually. I put the crumbs in a liquid hand soap bottle with a little water and made liquid soap! I broke off a little piece and use it on my face to exfoliate, and it feels GREAT! It lathers great and feels good on my skin.</li>
    <li> Best and only soap my family ever uses. Got rid of all our skin problems such a eczema, acne, body odor, etc..</li>
    <li> This soap is wonderful. I even washed my hair with it this morning and it feels soft and smooth ( and I did not condition) My skin feels soft and is glowing. My husband has started shaving with it and says his face feels smooth and fresh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this soap</li>
    <li> The soap is excellent! It&#x27;s actually fading acne spots on my face. I .bought it initially because it cleared up my daughter&#x27;s acne on her face. I&#x27;ve recommended it to 5 friends</li>
    <li> But  I cannot use it very often or it dries my skin. Othwerwise, it perfectly cleanses face and body and I love it&#x27;s mild fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is a real deal. Once you try black soap you will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> Excellent, will buy again soon.</li>
    <li> Leaves you feeling so clean. This definitely helped clear up a bad case of excema. Love using it on my face.</li>
    <li> ugly but iit works great on my skin</li>
    <li> i love this soap its the best out there cures acne,eczema,uneven skin tone,brightens face,help clear brown spots, i will order again all the time from only this selller</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and was as described. Great soap!</li>
    <li> My item molded within a few days of opening. No water used on or near product, but even if it did, it shouldn&#x27;t have molded, this is soap which is used with water.</li>
    <li> This was my first time ordering Africian Black Soap. I love it!! I let my fianc&amp;eacute; try it and I was surprised because he loves it. I will be placing another order soon. I received it on time. This was a good experience so I will continue ordering online. I am a happy customer.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping. Amazing product.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal. A lot of stores have started selling &amp;#34;African Black Soaps&amp;#34; that are jet black, perfectly smooth bars full of all manner of chemicals and additives. That is not what you are getting here. This is an unrefined, authentic and natural soap. It will have grit and maybe some twigs. It is also the best product I have ever used on my skin. It cleared up blemishes that withstood years of benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid and other harsh chemicals. It leaves your skin feeling a little tight from a good cleansing, and if followed up with a light moisturizer perfectly balanced and shine-free for the rest of the day. I use it on my face every day, and my body several times per week. I absolutely love this soap and recommend it to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things to be aware of, it will develop a white film if exposed to air. It looks a little like mold but it rinses right off with just a little water. The other thing to note is that this product may leave a little bit of sticky residue on the tub. I have had no problems wiping it off with vinegar or a little natural bathroom cleaner, and I&#x27;ll take a teeny bit of natural soap scum over using harsh detergents on my skin!</li>
    <li> Works great to soften skin.</li>
    <li> I use it all over my face and body. My skin is soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used unrefined black soap from Ghana ( my homeland ) for years and was very disappointed with this purchase. The black soap I purchased had coal, charcoal and dirt mixed with  the soap. I therefore need my money back as soon as possible.</li>
    <li> I love this soap! It has a great lather, exfoliates and has a clean scent. Best price that I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
    <li> This soap works great on my skin and is a great for all persons with skin disorders</li>
    <li> If you were/are skeptical ...DONT BE...this product is Great...i have been using this product for the past 2 mths..my blemishes have been clearing up greatly...along with my natural oils combination. I used it in my hair and it works greatly. No scum, no residue especially, since i&#x27;m on my natural hair journey. Squeaky clean from top to bottom...GET IT!! GET IT!! GET IT!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I&#x27;ve been using black soap for years. This company&#x27;s black soap has not let me  down. I will be ordering from them again.</li>
    <li> I have a rash on my skin from food allergies and this soap really helps to ease the itch. I&#x27;ve shared this soap with several family members and friends and have them using it now. Just bought 10 pounds to split among us.</li>
    <li> I love it! and shipping was quicker than expected. I am going to share with another family member. We have decided about the quality of this product is worth our life time commitment. your skin feel so and look great. Be sure to add your moisturizer after washing. Your face shine and skin is tight. Now I understand why the African skin is so pretty and tight.</li>
    <li> Perfect, my clients love this soap!</li>
    <li> The best deal I&#x27;ve seen for this amount.</li>
    <li> This soap is awesome! There&#x27;s a few things you might want to keep in mind if you&#x27;re not familiar with it. The soap contains little bits of what seems to be wood cinders so you need to take it easy when rubbing it against your skin so you don&#x27;t scratch yourself. Other than that, it cleans like nothing I&#x27;ve tried before. Every day use might be overkill though; you&#x27;ll probably want to use it every other day or a couple of times a week depending on your skin type.</li>
    <li> I would have given this product 2 stars for overall quality, but as it is black soap, it ultimately does do the job- clearing the skin etc. My problem with this product from this vendor, is that it is very pebbly and filled with pieces of stick and branches. I pulled out a branch that was about an inch thick and 4 inches long or so. Every time I went to use it, after the first time I wet it, it would get really dried out, pebbly and very abrasive. I did not enjoy using it and I am thinking about throwing the rest out. Now, my mom, who used some of it, said that she didn&#x27;t have the problem with it getting dried out (but hers was pebbly) but she doesn&#x27;t use hers every day. I do. So I don&#x27;t know if that makes a difference but it has never made a difference in the past with other black soaps. I am going to be buying this particular product from a different vendor because there&#x27;s just has way too many sticks and stones in it (literally), for my taste.</li>
    <li> A great soap, I use it everyday !!!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the speed of delivery &amp; packaging (product, not postal).  I mixed put this, with equal parts lemon juice to make the ph neutral for hair, (plus a little sea salt) in the blender and voila &#x3D; perfect shampoo/body wash.  It looks like a body butter, but can still be put into a squeeze bottle for hair application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also do not worry about preservatives as the lemon juice already has some &amp; I usually use it within a few days anyway.</li>
    <li> Molded if it&#x27;s a white layer it&#x27;s not mold it&#x27;s a reaction from being exposed to air. Don&#x27;t throw it away.  I don&#x27;t use any other soap after starting to use this ABS. After I wash my face I follow with argan oil and my skin is flawless.  Use it for my body too.</li>
    <li> I really like Black Soap!</li>
    <li> Terrible worst purchase ever</li>
    <li> Excellent, very natural and has a super lather.  Left my hair and face feeling fresh and clean without being stripped and dry.</li>
    <li> really good soap, feels clean.</li>
    <li> I love it. My skin looks and feel so healtjy. It do not come in a bar like other soap , But, I can mold it into a bar or oval shape, and it works great.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for more than a year now.  I love it because it naturally exfoliates my skin and leaves it feeling clean, fresh, and younger.  You will need to moisturize afterward because it doesn&#x27;t contain moisturizers.  I like to use this product for a while and then change to some other mild cleanser like dove for a while just to maintain good PH balance.  One bothersome fact that is inevitable with this soap is the dark color.  If you do not dry the soap after use, the black color will be left on your sink.  The reason is due to the natural ingredients used (thus, BLACK soap).  It is my all time favorite soap to use for skin conditions like acne, and eczema because the exfoliating abilities help keep skin&#x27;s newest, healthy layer exposed.</li>
    <li> I use the soap as a body wash as well to clean my face. It&#x27;s the darkest soap bought but lather better. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product &amp; I&#x27;m very pleased. I had used a black soap from another company and found it unsatisfactory, Very glad I found this one.</li>
    <li> After seeing all the hype about African Black soap I figured that I&#x27;ll try it and I&#x27;m more than happy with this product. Based on the feedback from other brands, this soap does the same thing!</li>
    <li> This soap is amazing!  I got it for my niece, who is having some trouble with her skin, but used it on my face for a few weeks as a text, and will probably never use anything else again.  It has a very clean, earthy smell, and although it has an unusual appearance initially, I think it is beautiful and organic. I gave some to several family members as gifts, and will definitely purchase this again. Great seller and product!! Thank you.</li>
    <li> Authentic black soap nothing cleanses skin better. Great for your body all over and eco friendly.</li>
    <li> I seen youtube videos on this soap and everyone was raving about it how it fixed their acne issues better than those popular acne products you see on TV. I have to be honest that i never tried those products on TV but this is what they were saying. I decided to buy the black soap because i have body acne (black heads)that i have gone to see my doctor and a dermatologist for. Their meds got rid of the cystic acne but didn&#x27;t get rid of the black heads that cause the out break. I would take tons of baths trying to scrub away my issues, using antibacterial and any ideas from friends that they have tried. anywho, that is what lead me to youtube looking up this black soap. I bought the soap. i have used this soap every day for a week now. the first 3 days of using it i noticed that my skin was clearing up it looked less bumpy. after a few more days more i noticed cleaning the area with a cloth black spot would be on it, it was the black heads being removed. After all these years FINALLY! i found something that works. I just wish i found out this solution earlier so i wouldn&#x27;t have scars. but i&#x27;m not giving up on that either. I&#x27;m only sharing my personal issues so that it can help anyone else out there. please try it you wont regret it. I did try it on my face. for me I wouldn&#x27;t use it every day, i would use it 2-3 time a week then again i don&#x27;t have acne on my face so figure it out for your self (more or less). actually with that my skin never looked so clean. You do need moisturizer on your skin because this is no joke cleaner. you want clean??? you got it!</li>
    <li> This was a really good deal, and I love to use this soap as a face wash. Keeps it clear and even toned without the irritating chemicals. It also lasts pretty long...I&#x27;ve had this stuff for little over a year now and I still have a huge chunk left :)</li>
    <li> Best  stuff  on the  market</li>
    <li> Received it in to separate plastic bags with broken up chunks. It lasted me a pretty long time considering I was also letting my Fiance have some. The only thing I can say abut using the soap is that it can be very drying so make sure that you moisturize right after using it.</li>
    <li> my colleague and friend love this soap as they love shea butter from smellgood, very nature, good to your skin.</li>
    <li> Worked great for a while then my skin had a bad recation</li>
    <li> Great product!  Love this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> This is handmade soap. I like it. But alot of people feel this soap get your washcloth dirty. But it get your skin soft.</li>
    <li> I love this soap! It leaves my skin absolutely squeaky clean and it all natural. It works better than just about any store bought soap.</li>
    <li> This is my second order from this company. The soap is awesome. I make liquid soap with it and add a little coconut oil and a couple of drops of tea tree oil and wash my hair with it. This amount should last me quite awhile. I have also used it to make a mask by adding some honey to it. My skin looks so soft and is clearing up tremendously. I am so glad I found out about this all natural soap!</li>
    <li> This really great product.The weight slight under 3lb but its close enough.</li>
    <li> This soap is very moisturizng and you can use it on your face and body. Keep it dry and in a cool place. I will break in pieces so use a wash cloth or sponge to hold it as you scrub.</li>
    <li> CLEAN, that&#x27;s what you are after washing with this soap!  A very generous size for a very reasonable price.  I like to wash my hair with it, too.  My hair squeaks with cleanliness!  The only down-side, if you could even call it that, because it probably isn&#x27;t to a great many people, is the smell.  It just smells like a lye soap.  But hey, I&#x27;m good with usually some of my homemade lotions for scent!  I will buy this again!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I suggest it too everyone. I bought &amp; paid for 3lbs &amp; that&#x27;s exactly what I got to the ounce. It came in a plastic bag double wrapped which I also liked.</li>
    <li> great product and delivery</li>
    <li> Excellent buy! !! I will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> This black soap was packaged properly and was delivered promptly. Very good quality, this is true black soap, as the soap is very dark in color and not lighter in color as some other companies sell. I will definitely continue to buy this soap.</li>
    <li> YEAH - Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Really lovely, earthy soap - nice texture&lt;br /&gt;Lathers very well&lt;br /&gt;Came in plastic bag in brick form, may want to have a sterile jar to put your soap in..&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m of fair and sensitive skin…my skin has improved using this soap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of caution if you&#x27;ve got sensitive skin..don&#x27;t use this on extra sensitive areas.  It&#x27;s a stronger soap.&lt;br /&gt;It is exfoliating…a use your hands to lather type soap.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, excellent.</li>
    <li> Soap is great.  Good lather and leaves skin feeling refreshed.  Would have gotten 5 stars but they sent me several larger pieces and a lot of little pieces some to small to use.</li>
    <li> Loooooove this soap. It came in three separate bags. I didn&#x27;t weigh them but they felt around the same weight (a lb each). You can&#x27;t go wrong with this black soap.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. Makes my skin stay clear.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent!</li>
    <li> Just as described, one the best soap&#x27;s I have ever used. It lathers up quite nicely. You can use it as is or drop a few pieces in a water bottle to make your own liquid black soap.</li>
    <li> My skin loves this stuff it&#x27;s cleared up everything from pimples to rash I am so happy I was introduced to this organic goodness!!</li>
    <li> The batch was soft and fresh.  Such a good deal.</li>
    <li> This soap is really great.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2JJZJSBBDEYTF]][[ASIN:B008SGKHEW Raw African Black Soap From Ghana 3lbs]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD PRODUCT, GREAT PRICES, AWESOME PACKING, EXCELLENT LATHER, GREAT FOR ACNE, DOES NOT DRY OUT SKIN, MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS IT TAKES ABOUT A WEEK EVEN WITH EXPEDITED SHIPPING...................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: i know i reviewed shea butter in this video, i bought the shea and black soap together and was to lazy to make 2seperate vids:-)&lt;br /&gt;soap is awesome, just a warning it isn&#x27;t like a hard bar of soap, you cant leave it in the shower it melts fast(lol thanks goodness i got three pounds) i put some pieces in a bottle with a few drops of water and had liquid black soap, my friend prefers to wet her hands and grab some together to shape a ball or normal square/retangle size of soap...</li>
    <li> my teenage son told me this was the way to go.  I took a chance and have to agree with him. gave my dove, irish spring and dial soap away. plus the price was great too</li>
    <li> Its smell and texture reminds me of our many years in Cameroon.  I think it&#x27;s really great and hope others will take advantage of this product</li>
    <li> This was my first time using African Black Soap and I&#x27;m hooked. It really does clear up just about anything as I suffer from dark elbows with small bumps that looks like goose bumps and a condition known as \\&quot;Keratosis Pilaris\\&quot;. I guess its more like acne because when I started using the black soap 2 weeks ago my elbows were kind of rough and bumpy and often became itchy. I have already noticed an improvement in the appearance and now my elbows are smoother and has started clearing and brightening up a bit. I mean they were not the darkest and I am african american but you could see it without really trying. I made a liquid form of it too and I also used it to wash my hair. I have never felt my hair so \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot;. When I wash my hair it gets super clean but this was a very different feel. I used a moisturizing conditioner afterwards, rinsed it and then towel dried my hair. It was soft but I also used the raw unrefined shea butter I purchased along with the black soap. It made my hair extra soft, held it in place and gave it a nice shine without being oily. I wash my entire body with it only after shaking it up real good before each use to mix the grainy stuff that settles in the bottom of the bottle. It actually works as an exfoliator and I love it. I still use my regular bodywash/showergels from bath and body works because it has a nice smell and contains jojoba and shea butter. I have been using it daily, even on my face and feel and all over refreshment after using it. I will definitely be purchasing it again but maybe this time from the sellers own web site that I can still purchase through my Amazon account.</li>
    <li> Black soap.. how I love thee. I use no acne cream or medicine. I simply use this soap. Most times I use all over my body. It naturally exfoliates, cleans makeup off, and makes my skin look as if I just scrubbed all the dead skin off. My skin literally shines from this.&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend says his skin breaks out from this... but I think he is afraid to really give it a try. You should try for at least one week to see if itis for you or not.</li>
    <li> Works wonders for me. Really makes my skin smooth and even in tone.  I use on acne prone areas especially like back and shoulders.  Also smooths out my face though I don&#x27;t really have acne there.  Can be a bit drying so tone and moisturize after you use.  I purchase again and again.</li>
    <li> Excellent....no complaints. Received exactly what I paid for....packaged securely, etc.. Will be returning to purchase more AS SOON as it runs out!</li>
    <li> Love it !!!! I works great this is the only soap I use on my face and body I am allergic to most sulfites which is in practically everything. Yes I will buy again and again !!!</li>
    <li> Great product and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this soap!!!</li>
    <li> Love soap it cleans my face like no other not even exfoliate scub creams clean like this! My husdand likes to clean his hands with it take off all the grim from a day at work.</li>
    <li> this soap came quickly but it was all dried out and it just breaks apart when you try to use it. i would not recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> this soap is great i currrently switched from using dusu osun because of the perfume in their soap.  makes your skin feel wonderful have not used regular soap in years. 40 but look like 25 highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the texture and smell of the product. It smells earthy and organic. It may sound corny but I actually felt a sense of gratitude to hold in my hands a product from the Mother Land. It was everything I dreamed it would be. I plan to turn some into a liquid form with distilled water and a few different oils. I can&#x27;t wait to use it as a facial/body wash. It arrived in a respectable 5 days. I will be updating my results...</li>
    <li> I received my order quick and it was exactly what i wanted.</li>
