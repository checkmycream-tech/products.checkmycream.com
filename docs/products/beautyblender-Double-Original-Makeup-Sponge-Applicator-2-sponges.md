<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t overly pleased with this product. The two-pack seemed like a great deal, but they don&#x27;t seem to be the genuine product. One of the blenders molded quickly after I started using it and the other seeped a great deal of pink dye whenever I&#x27;d wash it. After I threw these away, I went and bought a genuine Beautyblender at Sephora and was much more pleased with the quality of that one over these.</li>
    <li> I just love these blenders! I ordered the two pack a few weeks ago and have been using them every single day! They are good to use try dry and wet. The soho brand at walmart is harsh on your face and does not blend well. Which had me worried these would be the same. ALTHOUGH these are the softest squishiest blenders I have ever used! Easy to clean too. I use these sometimes for all over the face make up, or concealer under the eyes!&lt;br /&gt;-Queen</li>
    <li> good buy, blends concealer well. get it damp a little and blend in foundation</li>
    <li> What a deal. I got two blenders for a little over the price of one. Love them for blending my foundation and cream contours/highlight.</li>
    <li> my makeup professional used them on me and my face looked air brushed so i got one of my own. two in the pack the makeup washes out too. i clean them with a mild facial wash</li>
    <li> Blends my foundation in perfectly!</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t know what to think about this sponge because I never was a fan of using a sponge to apply my makeup, but since the first time I use the BB I fell in love, your make up looks so flawless! Now I&#x27;m a BB believer.</li>
    <li> I want to like these, I still use it. I wish you could get them in less obnoxious colors. I&#x27;m not really feeling the hot pink. On the plus side, I definitely feel like these are more gentle on my eye skin than my fingers. Maybe I need to get more used to using this but my make up looks so caked on and I end up blending with my finger in the end, especially under my eyes.</li>
    <li> BEAUTY BLENDERS HAVE SAVED MY MAKEUP APPLICATION! LOVE THEM!</li>
    <li> This is a good beauty sponge but don&#x27;t expect a miracle transformation because you use it. It does need to be washed out after every use to avoid bacteria.</li>
    <li> The first month I had these, I would have told you they were nice sponges.  They smoothed the makeup well, had a nice texture when wet.  About a month in, the texture seemed to get less effective, and then the unbelievable happened - the sponge developed little black dots....mold.  Despite the fact that I took immaculate care of these sponges, following all the care instructions, and they were reported to last for months and months with no problem, there were those insidious little spots, ruining the bright pink of the sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an avid buyer of beauty products, I expect such an expensive sponge to stand up to MORE than a normal sponge, not to fail out a month into its life.  If this is what make up artists are using for their makeup application, they are spending an extraordinary amount of money on something I can get comparable application from at a quarter of the price.  It is inexcusable for a product to be this overpriced and have quality this poor.  There is absolutely no reason to buy this, when there are dozens of sponges that will do an admirable and equal job.</li>
    <li> I love it the beauty blender is very soft , easy to use and apply my makeup very quickly and very good finish and natural .</li>
    <li> To be honest I did not find this sponge any  better than the ones we buy at the drug store....</li>
    <li> I feel like the regular sponge from CVS ($3.00 for 24 wedges) does the same job. Plus, I can just throw it away after one use and pick a completely new one from the pack. Maybe it&#x27;s just me but I hated to use this Beautyblender the second and all the subsequent times because it was stained, and could never be cleaned completely, and I felt like it will make me breakout.</li>
    <li> The simpler the better, and this sponge fits the bill.  I like that I can clean it and it comes back easily.  It blends the foundation into the skin and the tip is great for my eye area.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I love these sponges, my makeup goes on very smooth. Although they are kind of pricey they very worth it.</li>
    <li> I decided to give it a five-star rating even though my review is based on the product I received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This order is for my niece and she has reasons to believe that we&#x27;ve received a counterfeit product.&lt;br /&gt;This product was shipped and sold by Amazon so I might have received a returned product as I believe Amazon is well against counterfeit goods. The original product is amazing according to my niece and this review is not a reflection of the original BeautyBlender but more of the warning signs of a fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My niece owns the exact same product bought from Sephora, though at a higher cost but definitely original. And the difference between the looks and functionality of both the Original BeautyBlender and the one received from Amazon is very different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the main differences:&lt;br /&gt;- The first thing she noticed was that the BeautyBlender received was way smaller than the original! Nearly twice as small! Even when soaked in water, the size is different.&lt;br /&gt;- The colour runs when washed, and might leave pink residue on your face if used with makeup. The colour does not run on the original.&lt;br /&gt;- The texture of the original was extremely smooth, the one received was rough and felt like cheap sponge.&lt;br /&gt;- The shape was different! The one received \\&quot;squashed\\&quot; and deformed and no more in the ideal teardrop shape of the original which defeats the purpose of its intended functionality.&lt;br /&gt;- The overall feeling of holding the original and \\&quot;counterfeit\\&quot; in both hands, you could tell that the materials were different.&lt;br /&gt;- The packaging looks authentic, but my niece has thrown away the original packaging so we couldn&#x27;t make any comparisons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people might bash the product because.they have no idea they&#x27;ve received a fake. You&#x27;ll probably need to have touched/used the original product before being able to tell the difference.</li>
    <li> Great sponge for any kind of make up. Softer than the normal triangle sponges you can purchase at most drug stores, the Beauty Blender when wet is almost silky feeling. Great for foundation!</li>
    <li> This beauty blender is ok. My favorite sponge was by MAX factor but it has been discontinued for a while now and I&#x27;ve been on the search for a good sponge ever since. This isn&#x27;t my favorite product, but it&#x27;ll have to do. i do like the shape though. It makes it easy to handle and get into tight spots like around your eyes and nose. It&#x27;s ok, try it.</li>
    <li> This little sponge makes your skin look like there is nothing on it when you use it to apply foundation or under eye concealer. It looks natural and just flawless!!!!</li>
    <li> I love to use beauty blenders.  My makeup goes on more smoothly than when I put it on with my finger.</li>
    <li> I have ordered other brands but these are the only ones that hold their shape afted repeated use.  I highly reccomend these.</li>
    <li> this sponge is amazing. i love the way it blends make up together and doesnt feel like you put on so much. very light and washes very easily. i dont think i can ever use a different sponge again</li>
    <li> it was fake!!!! not beauty blender</li>
    <li> These are totally fake. They came in a plastic bag and are totally different from authentic beautyblenders. The texture is much more dense and they get huge when you get them wet. I am an avid BB user and am so mad. I thought I was getting the real thing.</li>
    <li> Where has this beauty blender been all my life.  My makeup has never looked so smooth.  I have used many different brushes in the past and some very expensive, but none of them can help me achieve the look that the beauty blender can.  Now, applying my foundation is a breeze because I do not have to be there trying to smooth out the brush strokes.  I also love blending in my concealer with this product, it is amazing at blending in the harsh lines caused when contouring.  I also this use the knock of brands of the beauty blender, but the original one has a texture that the knock offs have not been able to duplicate. Do not spend your money on anything else and purchase the beauty blender you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing liquid foundation for twenty years. I have tried every newfangled way of applying it: from expensive foundation brushes, all types of sponges and of course, my fingers. I always go back to application by finger. Seems the easiest and most effective way. Then I saw Beauty Blender in a YouTube video. It intrigued me. I watched a few YouTube tutorials, and decoded I should buy one. At twenty bucks for one sponge, it is pricey, but I went for it, but keeping my expectation level down. I&#x27;ve tried too many gimmicks... but this is no gimmick. It REALLY WORKS! It transforms your foundation to an airbrushed look. So easy to apply (just make sure sponge is damp). And you end up using less foundation.    Hands down, one of my  best beauty purchases EVER!     Suggest you go on YouTube and and view some BeautyBlender tutorials. It will help you perfect the application.     UPDATED      Eight months later, I just opened  my third beauty blender. I love this sponge.  One thing that I do is clean it after EVERY use, I use the beauty blender cleaner -- this one is the most effective. I&#x27;ve tried using Baby shampoo, but the Beauty Blend brand cleaner seems to clean the sponge much better. Soap.com  now has the cleanser for 30% less than retail.     The manufacturer recommends replacing blender every three months. I use mine every day, and find that this rec is pretty accurate. After three months, the sponge is not as good at application as it was new.   I found that the blender actually \\&quot;ripens\\&quot; after about two weeks of continued use. It stays that way for about three months.</li>
    <li> I love my beauty blender!  Knockoff blenders are not the same.  They cause streaking, the absorbency is different, not the same.  But the real Beautyblender is amazing.  I use it for my bb cream and foundation.  I get it wet first so that it doesn&#x27;t absorb as much of the makeup product.  It doesn&#x27;t cause streaking, patches, etc.  I am interested in the new white ones that I have heard are now available.  Only reason being that when I wash my sponge I can always see some pink water be rinsed off.  I can&#x27;t tell that the sponge is depositing pink pigments on my skin but still white might be better.?</li>
    <li> Hello, this is Rogelio, and i just want to say that this is an AWESOME make up, OH! MY! GOSH!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes based on reviews (on this site and other sites), but there is nothing special about these. I wanted something to help ensure smooth application of make-up, but the Beauty Blender did nothing much different than any other discount store sponge. It was more awkward to work with, too.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter and she loved it.</li>
    <li> This truly gives such a wonderful finish. I have many make up brushes to apply foundation with and even with much blending, leaves my skin not as flawless as this beauty blender. I give it four stars because I do wash them after every use and the last time I was cleaning I lightly scratched it to get some extra foundation off and a piece of the actual beauty blender came off. Be extra gentle while cleaning. It is pricey, and it is a great make up tool, but I hope they hold up for a while for the price.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this beautyblender. It&#x27;s so soft and puffs up when wet, and it&#x27;s cool on your skin when you apply make up. When I use mineral make up, I put on the makeup with a regular kabuki brush, then I like to use this to touch up the minerals. I think it makes my face makeup look natural and makes me glow.. Sometimes when I put a little too much make up on (minerals or liquid) I like to use this to give me that airbrushed look. I admit, I had some doubts about this product, especially because it was so expensive for two sponges and because I mainly used mineral foundation and wasn&#x27;t sure it if would work too well with it, but my doubts were quickly diminished. I introduced this to my friend who usually uses liquid foundation and she loves it. Only con would be that after washing/cleaning the sponge, the liquid make up doesn&#x27;t always come off fully. For those of you who are a little OCD, a beige/pink sponge isn&#x27;t always attractive but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! The imitations are just that, imitations. I have tried both and this product is by far the best investment I have made in my beauty routine! This is money well spent.</li>
    <li> First of all I use less make up when applying (just a pea size on the cheeks and forehead, and a bit where needed). I bounce the dump sponge all over my face and that&#x60;s it! Flawless, natural look. Even my husband commented! For me it&#x60;s the best make up applicator (I used foundation brush, make up regular sponge, and my favorite till now fingers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy I bought the cleanser too, only because I can place sponge on top to dry, and later I replace liquid with other delicate soap. After the sponge is dry I keep it in the original plastic case (separate from the second one by a plastic divider). All clean and easy to use. Latex free if someone&#x60;s allergic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The average life of the sponge supposed to be 3 months, but my first sponde lasted 2 years and than started to fall part (because I don&#x60;t use it everyday). Easy to clean and storage. I recommend to buy a double pack at once, it&#x60;s better value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll come back for more for sure!</li>
    <li> Packaging was in bubble wrap and in good condition upon arrival. The box was just as shown as in the photo (2 together as a heart was cute). Shipped overseas in about a week, which was really nice. I&#x27;d seen a few videos online on how to use it and thought it would be a good addition to my routine. I apply concealer and foundation (sometimes highlighter) first with brushes to apply. Then, I rinse the blender under luke-warm water; squeeze it out a few times until it&#x27;s wet; then towel dry gently so it&#x27;s only slightly damp. I blot this all over my face to even out the make up, and it turns out looking somewhat air brushed. It&#x27;s very simple to use and easy to clean. The sponge typically does come up with a little bit of product, but overall, there are no streaks or smears or brush strokes on my face. It doesn&#x27;t look cakey or overly applied. The first time I washed it, some pink did come out, and I accidently poked a hole in it from my fingernail, but it didn&#x27;t make a difference the next time it was used. I think this a great product, and I would recommend it to anyone looking to achieve a flawless finish.</li>
    <li> I just received my duo package of beauty blender sponges and I was shocked at the size of them.  From the picture, they look much larger than they do in person - I don&#x27;t see how these tiny sponges can do the job they&#x27;re supposed to do on your face. Although they said that they would expand when wet.  However, the picture of the sponges on your site is so much larger than the actual sponge, so I was disappointed - we&#x27;ll see how they work.</li>
    <li> I am in love with my beauty blender! It was recommended to me by a friend who knows her makeup and I tried it and love it!!!! Couldn&#x27;t put makeup on without it now! Buy it!!!!</li>
    <li> My Favourite way to blend my face with liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> Best thing that ever happened to my foundation routine</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;FAKE!!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!! Not in factory packaging. Shipped in a clear plastic bag with nothing but a bar code/product name label on it.</li>
    <li> Flawless application everytime! I usually run my BB under water and use it wet, but it works if you use it dry too. Definitely worth buying!</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical that these were the real deal, but they really do make foundation lighter and smoother. I was amazed at how airbrushed my face looked and how much less foundation I had to use to get the effect. It has stood up to repeated use and washing pretty well. Some foundation color has stained it, but it&#x27;s still clean and usable.</li>
    <li> Let me first start off by saying I pretty much use beautyblenders religiously so I&#x27;m very aware of what an authentic beautyblender should look and feel like. With that being said what I received was without a doubt not a beautyblender product! I don&#x27;t doubt that they send authentic ones as well I just think they tried to pull the wool over the eyes of some of their buyers by sending some cheap fakes...there&#x27;s alot if true beautyblender sellers on Amazon I suggest buying from another...</li>
    <li> Great product! Easy to use and blends so fast</li>
    <li> This is such a wonderful product. I ordered the 2 sponges with \\&quot;Prime\\&quot; shipping and I cannot be happier. I use the sponge while its wet and it applies my makeup beautifully (MUFE Mat Velvet+) and I even blend my concealer with it. I wash it with a inexpensive makeup removing facewash (a Clean&amp;Clear one for sensitive skin) everyday after use and its still amazing. The only thing thats a little concerning is that a little bit of the pink dye comes out when its washed. But that never rubs on my skin or anything. This sponge has taken place of a foundation&amp;concealer brush. Def. a new holy grail product.</li>
    <li> Fake! not the real beauty blender, what a rip off!</li>
    <li> FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE. DO NOT PURCHASE.</li>
    <li> I love the Beautyblender.  It has changed my life as far as makeup blending goes.  However, this blender is too small.  Get the bigger one that comes as only one blender as opposed to two.</li>
    <li> i cant rant and rave about these blenders enough! I have never had such a flawless airbrushed finish to my foundation application ever! all i do is complete wet the sponge with water until its about 3 times its normal size then rinse till no more water come out. I apply foundation either to my face or hand and &amp;#34;pat&amp;#34; the foundation in with the fat side of the sponge then use the pointed side for my concealer. I dont what i would do without this! i cant tell you how many compliments i get on my &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34; No other sponges can compare. I did try a spehora brand of the blender that didnt even come close!!!</li>
    <li> I am so confused and even afraid to use the product. I saw the back of the packaging and some words are misspelled. Instead of an &amp;#34;n&amp;#34; there is an &amp;#34;m&amp;#34; and I have a feeling the product could be totally fake. I have no idea how to distinguish if it is or not. HELP!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE my beauty blenders</li>
    <li> Stop using your fingers to blend your liquid makeup!  I&#x27;ve used sponges (those little wedges) before and wasn&#x27;t impressed.  These are the perfect shape and the texture is so fine that they don&#x27;t absorb your precious makeup. The best part--you won&#x27;t look &#x27;made up&#x27;, you will look naturally gorgeous--no lines, no demarcation. This is the air-brushed look without the expense. Don&#x27;t spring for the cleanser-just rinse and squeeze through any mild soap. One more tip: Slightly dampen before use; your makeup will glide on like silk. No one needs to be putting any traction on their skin. I am an RN and a licensed esthetician--skin is my business.</li>
    <li> Love it&lt;br /&gt;Blends fabulously</li>
    <li> I had seen this sponge in several videos, but was really reluctant to buy it based solely on price.  I decided to go ahead with the purchase and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  I have always disliked getting foundation on my fingers, but disliked more how much sponges soaked up the foundation, therefore wasting it.  This one solves both my problems.  Using it damp is the key and it makes for a clean, flawless finish.  I have used it with both a full coverage foundation and a barely there type foundation and it is fantastic with either.  I was a bit surprised when I cleaned it and the water was dripping off pick, but there has been no change in quality of the sponge.  I do recommend buying the 2 pack as it&#x27;s a better value and then you have a back up.  Will recommend this to anyone and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I am on the beauty blender wagon! I was hearing such great things about this makeup applicator and they weren&#x27;t lying! This beats my Mac 188 brush, my Sephora brush and just about all the other brushes I used to use to apply my makeup!! I consider myself a makeup junkie and I recommend this product! I will be coming back to purchase this in the future!</li>
    <li> I am a licensed cosmetologist in California. I&#x27;ve been through MANY brushes and sponges of all kinds to get a flawless foundation application. So far NOTHING has come close to this amazing \\&quot;Beautyblender\\&quot; sponge. The super-fine texture makes sure you don&#x27;t get uneven coverage yet allows for a flawless finish. This does not let your foundation cake into the fine-lines, or deep lines, as other applicators do. I have tried using a &#x27;Smashbox&#x27; foundation for over a year (determined to apply it professionally) and the brush that came with it never came close to second against this sponge! The foundation is now a professional airbrushed look because of this sponge. I am elated and very glad I discovered and picked up the double pack of this sponge - I will NEVER apply foundation without it again. I use my &#x27;Philosophy&#x27; Cleanser and the sponge cleanes out phenomenally. Make sure you wash it after each application and allow it to air-dry so no bacteria will build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Hint: don&#x27;t try to cover all your imperfections in one go. Allow the first light application to dry, then apply another thin layer over the trouble areas. This makes for a more realistic coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Sailor Hill, CA</li>
    <li> After years of hesitation and debating whether or not this tool was worth my money, I am happy to report its worth the hype and money!  Super happy that I found mine at a great price (seller) here on Amazon! When using this to apply your foundation it gives it a flawless, airbrushed finish/look.  You can also use to this apply your concealer and easy to clean.  Been debating?? Stop... and make the purchase! Its worth the hype!</li>
    <li> you have got to buy this!!!! i love love love this! your make-up will look soooo perfect. well worth the price and they last forever! you will get your money worth! be good to yourself and buy one.</li>
    <li> Best thing ever invented!!!</li>
    <li> I really like applying my foundation with the Beautyblender Ultimate Makeup Sponge and I love the results I get as well. More of a dewy finish. In the recent past I used a foundation brush and no matter what, I always ended up with brush strokes! Did not like that look at all. With the sponge I get a nice and smooth application of whatever foundation I choose to use at the time. Works well with liquids and creams. This is my second purchase of the sponges. I am giving them as belated Christmas gifts. To cleanse the sponges, I completely let the sponge dry and liberally apply Dawn Dish Liquid and gently rub it in to the makeup on the sponge adding a tiny bit of water at a time. When it&#x27;s completely clean, rinse well, ring out and towel dry, and that&#x27;s it! You&#x27;re good to go!</li>
    <li> The first pack I bought of these (2 in pack) last me OVER A YEAR! They are awesome. Distribute liquid and cream foundation perfectly, with buildable coverage, and don&#x27;t fall apart like cheap makeup sponges do. The shape is really handy for applications on all parts of the face, without feeling like you&#x27;ve masked over your eyebrows. I will continue to buy these as long as they&#x27;re made.</li>
    <li> This is the best makeup applicator I have ever used. I have used it for my foundation/concealer and it just does an amazing job. You have to stipple it on and the curves of the sponge let you get into the inner eye area and around the nose. Can&#x27;t find these anywhere in Canada so I had to buy off Amazon. Great find.</li>
    <li> AAAAMMMMAAAAZZZZIIINNNNGGG!!  This sponge helps to achieve a beautiful and well blended foundation finish.  I honestly thought I was paying $20 for a sponge that would be no different than any other.... but gave in because of the high ratings.  I was proven wrong and was very pleasantly surprised!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product. Blends in foundation to the skin for a flawless finish. The shape Is perfect as the narrow side works great to blend in concealer. Completely love it!!!</li>
    <li> I loooove this sponge! i have been using it everyday for 3 weeks now and its amazing! it doesn&#x27;t absorb the makeup! the makeup goes onto the skin well and helps in blending the makeup evenly too! it washes well and it holds up pretty strong. i wish i knew about this a long time ago. i will forever buy and buy this sponge. i swear by it.</li>
    <li> I find them a bit hard and not easy to work with.</li>
    <li> Love these, although it ripped after 2 uses. Still using it but was a little upsetting.</li>
    <li> I love these! I prefer them to a disposable foam wedge for seamlessly blending concealer and foundation. I like the versatility the test shape offers, particularly the tip when blending makeup in the corners of my eyes.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Shipped fast</li>
    <li> As a professional makeup artist, this is the one must have tool that I have to have in my kit! The Beauty Blender helps achieve the most flawless, professional results with minimal effort. Love! Love! this product.</li>
    <li> The hype is real. Watch some YouTube videos on it!</li>
    <li> I cannot put on concealer without my beauty blender. I seriously don&#x27;t know how I ever managed to do it without a beauty blender. So so good!</li>
    <li> You seriously cannot go wrong with the beauty blender - it&#x27;s the best makeup sponge I&#x27;ve ever tried and I recommend it to everyone I know that wears liquid foundation. If you want an easy application of foundation that looks flawless, look no further. This provides a very nice airbrushed look. Best of all, it&#x27;s quick and mess free. I won&#x27;t apply my foundation any other way. I discovered this from youtube gurus constantly talking about it and now I can&#x27;t shut up about it either!&lt;br /&gt;I just recently replaced my beauty blender that was a few years old - they last a while when you take care of them. It&#x27;s important to keep them clean to prevent breakouts...I inevitably had to replace mine because it developed black mold spots and stained it - gross! This here is the best deal - everywhere else sells a single beauty blender for about $20, here you get two of them! Score!&lt;br /&gt;Also, I never bother with the fancy cleaners, I use hot water and Dawn dish soap and it cleans them perfectly - they look and feel brand new (unless yours gets so old it develops mold lol). If you&#x27;re still worried about bacteria, you can pop them in the microwave (google directions for this).  Also, I&#x27;ve learned from experience....I use castile soap to clean my brushes, but it cleans so well, it will break up the pink dye from these sponges. Just FYI!</li>
    <li> This litle pink sponge is amazing!  I didn&#x27;t know what the hype was all about, but it is worth every penny!  You simply dampen the sponge, and it applies your foundation very smoothly &amp; evenly, espcially around the eyes...it&#x27;s easy to get in the corners.  The cleanser is worth it...it really cleans out the sponge of old makeup and keeps it fresh, rinsing with just soap &amp; water didn&#x27;t do the trick.</li>
    <li> Very practical&lt;br /&gt;Very suitable</li>
    <li> Provides an even coverage of makeup. I definitely use less make up. The only problem I have is the sponge does not come completely clean and my sponge has already torn on the rounded ended after having for only 2 weeks. But the cleaner that is made for cleaning the sponge is excellent. I was cleaning all my makeup brushes with baby shampoo and could not get the white ones back to there original white  color. However the cleaner does the job and  my brushes look brand new...the cleaner is excellent!!!</li>
    <li> this product will make your foundation application a breeze but it will make it look like you spent forever blending and perfecting your foundation.   just make sure you buy the cleaner so you can clean it well and not accumulate bacteria.</li>
    <li> Best make up sponge on the market.  It lasts a long time if you clean it regularly... about 6 months per make up sponge.  I got my first pair with Beautyblender liquid cleanser.  The cleanser lasts more than a year, so I&#x27;ve re-ordered the sponges while using the cleanser I got with the first set.  It really applies foundation in an airbrushed look.  I cannot live with out this.  Also, the smaller side is best for concealer... love this.</li>
    <li> I cannot do my makeup without this!!!! I use this thing every single day! so worth the money, and it lasts a pretty long time, even with cleaning after each use! Will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> Great product, blends make up</li>
    <li> The product I received was not a real beauty blender. VERY DISAPPOINTED :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for years and know the real thing...</li>
    <li> I never thought I would spend more than $20 on a makeup sponge but my curiosity was peaked after I saw some reviews on You Tube.  The directions tell you to \\&quot;bounce\\&quot; the sponge off your skin which is essentially a stippling motion.  I found this to be the most effective way of using the Beauty Blender.  This is especially helpful in applying my Gerda Spillman Bio-Fond cream foundation.  The effect is dewy and flawless.  The sponge also works well wet although you get less product on.  As for maintenance, I wash it after each use with a baby shampoo and the left over foundation comes off easily and the sponge seems to be holding up well, although I have only had it for about two months and do not use it everyday.  Overall, a good product and gives you the ability to blend and build your foundation well depending on if you chose to use the sponge wet or dry.</li>
    <li> Fake fake fake! Packaging is the only thing that is authentic. Guess you get what you pay for. Too good to be true</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the hype on this product.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again because they are expensive and the regular triangular sponges work just as good.  But then again everyone has their own preference when it comes to applying makeup.  I noticed that when I would wash the Beautyblender some of the pink dye would wash out as I can see it run down the sink.  That didn&#x27;t make me feel too happy.  Again it&#x27;s a preference thing...</li>
    <li> I was so happy the product was 1)available on Amazon! 2)Available via Double Package and 3)Great Item!      This was my first Amazon purchase! Love it!  Free shipping to AK was a major plus!      This item is so awesome!  No more buying sponges and throwing them away!  This is such a revolutionary item!  Wash it and use it again and again!  Smooths out the foundations and eye shadows so nicely!  I use it for all my Mary Kay products!      Happy in Snowy AK!  Margaret Edin  Independent Beauty Consultant  [...]</li>
    <li> I have been using this sponge for close to 6 months now and they&#x27;re in great shape. I spray a bit of Mario Bedescu&#x27;s facial spray in lieu of immersing completely in water, and press and bounce the sponge across my face until I have full coverage. I recommend washing every 5 uses or so to prevent significant build up of foundation as this may cause breakouts to occur, especially on sensitive skin. I actually find liquid soap to be most effective and I scrub with a small toothbrush designated solely for this purpose.</li>
    <li> Ok..it holds together nicely while you dab on your foundation...but really I don&#x27;t see what the big deal is about this sponge.  My skin looked absolutely the same as when I used a cheapy sponge from the drugstore.  This will last a lot longer however as it doesn&#x27;t fall to bits when you apply your makeup.  I do not like the way all the pink dye starts coming out of the sponge when you wash it...yukko!  Will I keep using it though?  Sure...it&#x27;s a nice makeup tool but if you are expecting it to make your skin look flawless...I think you will be disappointed.  I say if you have the extra money and you like to play around with different beauty tools, go for it!</li>
    <li> These are perfect makeup applicators. They wash up nicely with dish soap or the Beautyblender cleaner. The dense foam really works well to blend.</li>
    <li> My very first use was amazing!! I guess I need the cleaning solution for same effect as first time. Overall it&#x27;s okay</li>
    <li> This is the best tool you can have to help give flawless makeup application.  This is not like the regular makeup sponges you can buy in stores.  Its teardrop design gives a seamless application, and the smaller tip can be used in the delicate eye area and to conceal blemishes and dark spots (if I had any, that is...lol) I have used brushes to apply foundation, and there are some that work really well, but nothing holds a candle to the BeautyBlender.  The key is to use it wet, although I will admit that on days when I am running behind I have used it dry and it still works great.  Using it wet really helps sheer out my foundation, giving it a \\&quot;second skin\\&quot; appearance.  The sponge is nice sized, and very durable.  The one I am using currently is going on it&#x27;s sixth month of use; with daily foundation application.  It never flakes off, or begins to fall apart like cheap drugstore brand sponges.  The one drawback is that it will get stained from products (especially Revlon Color Stay foundations), so it appears to be dirty even when it is freshly washed.  That is the only drawback I can think of.  I know the price can turn some people away, but I assure you, it is worth every penny.  You get two sponges and that will last me almost a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I forgot to mention...&lt;br /&gt;this product is latex free, which is great for me and it also works well with mineral makeup.  Use it the same way you would for liquid foundation; wet it, pat it in the makeup and stipple it.  Works really well!</li>
    <li> The sponge is ok. My make up looked just as good before I started using the sponge. Do not recommend, save your money..</li>
    <li> This is NOT an original BB product.</li>
    <li> Do not buy the wanna be&#x27;s or the imitation sponges from sephora, tj maxx etc. They do not come close to the original beauty blender. These sponges are a life changer for me. I use chanel liquid foundation with a damp blender sponge and get flawless application. Whats even more impressive is that I can use the makeup on just the parts of my skin that are problematic and need coverage without applying to my entire face and the sponge allows me to blend it so smoothly there is never a line. The imitation sponges are much denser and do not deliver the same result. In this case, you definitely get what you pay for. I clean my sponge about once every 2 weeks and they usually last a good 6 months. This is a well worth it purchase.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Although i give it a 4 start cuz they are expensive &#x3D;( i wish they could be a couple dollar shipper. But i definitely recommended to everyone they are soooo... soft and blends foundation nicely!</li>
    <li> love this product and how it applies my make up. i can get a full coverage look with out using a lot of product. Im really happy it came with two. One that i can use and one for back up. I ordered a knock off beauty blender and I have to say you cant beat the real thing. Totally worth the money!</li>
    <li> I ordered this after seeing a youtube beauty blogger use it. Its the triangle wedge we all use to use but sooooooooo much better! Love Love Love the Beautyblender!</li>
    <li> Puts makeup on perfectly without a mess on your hands and makes it super easy to build coverage. Really easy to clean as well.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best makeup sponge I have ever used! It reduced the amount of makeup I use, and applies it so evenly.</li>
    <li> These are really nothing special. They don&#x27;t seem to improve the appearance of my foundation at all, and the pointed end is useless. I am disappointed. They are also extremely difficult to clean.</li>
    <li> I love my beauty blender for cream concealer and liquid foundation. LOVE</li>
    <li> Not sure if the item is authentic or not. I guess the price was too good to be true. Did not receive the original packaging and came in a plastic bag. The original Beauty Blender is a small sponge and expands when you put water on it. These sponges are already expanded.. I don&#x27;t think these are authentic. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> I thought this product would help me have the illusion of having no foundation on. It didn&#x27;t do much for me. I don&#x27;t use this product to put foundation on anymore. I just use it to &#x27;matte&#x27; my foundation if I do use it at all. I have embarrassing problem skin so I have to use foundation everyday to cover it. Maybe I just need to keep trying it. I rather use my foundation brushes.</li>
    <li> Best sponge. Worth every penny. I have been through drugstore, professional makeup versions, Mac, Lancome, and every other dept. store sponge and none of them lasts as long and applies as wonderfully as these little pink sponges. Very durable even after daily washing with soap.</li>
    <li> Great product for applying foundation!</li>
    <li> This was for my daughter. She loves it. I personally think these things are pricey for what they are, but the seller provided it at a better cost than I could get it locally and the shipping was prompt. I was very satisfied with my order. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Beauty Blender is my new fave item. Make up goes on flawless with this sponge plus it&#x27;s super affordable shipped super fast as well.</li>
    <li> There is no question about it. I like this BB, but the outside plastic packaging is a bit different than pictured here. I find that this product works best with cream/mousse products, and liquid foundation would soak too much, even with a damp sponge. I plan on using my expensive foundations with a brush, and using this with my drugstore foundations. I&#x27;ve used it with the L&#x27;oreal Magic Souffle Foundation and it was wonderful! Better than airbrushed.</li>
    <li> Thank god for this blender~ I love this product and am thankful that I got it quickly from Amazon. This blender is highly recommended by beauty professionals and now I know why! Don&#x27;t hesitate pick this up now!</li>
    <li> shape, texture &amp; firmness of the sponge is great.  the pointy end is terrific for getting under the eye to blend in concealer, smudge eyeliner - or wipe away the extra.  put on my foundation, fix my eye area &amp; put on gel/creme blushers - perfect.  THE PROBLEM is, regardless of if i am using on others or myself . . . bottom line, very expensive for the product and not justifiable for a disposible item such as this.      Perhaps this is a economic stimulus item??!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It gives your foundation an airbrush effect. A must have! And I got two for the price one!!! 5★★★★★</li>
    <li> I bought this because all the beauty gurus were saying how they couldn&#x27;t live without their beauty blender.  I contemplated the cheaper copy version but thought I should go with the original.  Meh, it&#x27;s just a makeup sponge in a cute and mostly useful shape and a bright and cheery colour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I could take it or leave it and feel like I have wasted my $.  It was ridiculously expensive for a piece of synthetic sponge that would have cost 20 cents to make.  I wish I had spent the $ on a Sigma brush instead!</li>
    <li> Amazing results! Was pleasantly surprised. The imitations are no where close to the original. It is definately  worth the money.</li>
    <li> love it, smooth application.and very easy to use. always wash after use to avoid makeup buildup. but very good though.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize when purchasing, but they must have redone the beautyblender. Before it was very squishy and elastic-y, if that makes sense. Now it&#x27;s more of a dense sponge, it doesn&#x27;t have as much bounce as my original one. It is a wonderful blender though, despite the new consistency. Just different is all.</li>
    <li> This is my second one I have ordered.  I also ordered one for my sister. she saw mine and ask where I got it.  Told her she said next time you order git me one.  the shape is great, the point let you get around the eyes so much better Just dab conceller with sponge and it goes on so smooth. Love it Love it</li>
    <li> Can be achieved with this little sponge. I bought my first BB during the \\&quot;Big S&#x27;s\\&quot; friends and family sale, and I was hooked. You really can achieve flawless application. The Beautyblender is soft, not scratchy and the pointy tip makes getting areas (i.e. around the nose) that perhaps a brush cannot. I use this on myself and clients.</li>
    <li> I use it With MAC liquid foundation. As for Cleaning:  you can either buy the beautyblender &amp;#34;Blender Cleanser&amp;#34; which is expensive to me (but I got it to try)....So I did find that you can use baby shampoo to clean the sponge and it worked really really good.&lt;br /&gt;SPONGE IS SO WORTH BUYING. Get it!!!!!  You won&#x27;t regret it after you use it, I didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> this sponge is amazing. it does stain pretty easy but it blends amazingly. I bought the 2 pack because it was more cost effective but I wont need to use the second one any time soon.</li>
    <li> I love applying my liquid foundation (Revlon ColorStay) using the Beautyblender.  It does indeed give me sort of an airbrush finish.  The finished look does not look cakey or streaky at all.  I did not buy the beatyblender cleanser (however, I received a free sample in my package with the two sponges, but I have not yet tried it).  I clean/wash mine with baby shampoo and it works pretty well.  Two cons are that (1) it does tend to stain a little AND (2) when washing it, the pink color runs a bit...leaving the beautyblender looking pale pink after just a couple washes.  But these cons don&#x27;t bother me so much.  I&#x27;m glad I purchased this item!</li>
    <li> This item replaced my foundation brush &amp; blush brush. I&#x27;ve suggested this item to all my friends. I love it!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my teenage granddaughter ... it was a great choice and just what she wanted.  Great for the teenage set,</li>
    <li> I bought the BeautyBlender by recommendation from The Beauty Department (thebeautydepartment.com) and I am SO GLAD I did. I always applied my liquid foundation with my hands, and it was messy, thick and streaky. I bought the BeautyBlender (and have only been using one from the package, so I will always have the second in \\&quot;storage\\&quot;) and it truly makes for FLAWLESS application. It is soft, blendable and totally usable (I use it damp) and my makeup looks flawless, soft, and clean-looking. I have gotten tons of compliments in the last few weeks about my skin. It is simple to use (\\&quot;stippling\\&quot; across skin), and I have no more streaks, no more gross, messy hands on my face, and I think my makeup looks more natural and more beautiful than ever. I have never had any luck with concealer brushes (they always left heavy streaks and took forever to apply, in my experience) and I had almost given up completely. This is the easiest, most simple way to apply flawless foundation, and it doesn&#x27;t absorb or waste ANY product (especially when wet). I also use it for \\&quot;finishing\\&quot; when blending my blush/bronzer and under-eye concealer. To clean I just rinse with my all-natural handsoap and leave it out to dry.  I appreciate fast, easy application and I will use the BeautyBlender forever.</li>
    <li> The Beauty Blender sponge and blender cleanser were recommended to me several years ago by a nationally-known makeup artist. He suggested using it for an air-brushed appearance of liquid foundations. I fell in love with it within the first week! It took a few days to figure out the correct amount of foundation to dispense with it, etc... but once I had that figured out, the application was flawless. It works best (like with any application technique of liquid foundation) to apply a few light coverage coats versus one heavy coat. I am only giving it 4 stars just due to the fact that I find on days I&#x27;m in a hurry, it&#x27;s still faster to apply with my fingertips versus using the sponge and then having to wash it out afterwards. But this is more of a \\&quot;user-problem\\&quot; and not a problem with the sponge. I would highly recommend the sponges and the blender cleanser to clean them out with. Super slick!</li>
    <li> I use Beautyblender sponges daily to apply my foundation and absolutely love them.  I have finally opened this Beautyblender 2 pack after ordering them almost a month ago.  These sponges do NOT feel at all like Beautyblenders.  They are really rough and not soft at all.  They made my face sting after makeup application.  I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on, but these are not the quality and softness I expect from a Beautyblender.  Very disappointed I spent almost $30 on these.</li>
    <li> Whoever thought of this little gem deserves an award...I&#x27;ve tried many different cheaper knock-offs, but there&#x27;s none like the original.  Yes, a little pricey, but you get what you pay for !!!  Money well spent...</li>
    <li> I give it three star because it&#x27;s really being over priced, you can get a way better brush at this price. Yes, it&#x27;s a nice sponge, it works like miracle, but it doesn&#x27;t worth it. If you watch Youtube and do a little bit research on prive labeling you will know what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
    <li> This beauty blender is great,if u  use as directed it blends beautiful. You will be using less makeup and look flawless.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like to use sponges when applying makeup, but this product works very well on all types of skin. It does a great job of covering up blemishes and helps reduce the appearance of enlarged pores. I&#x27;ve even made several of my friends fans of this product as well!</li>
    <li> Best thing Ever, Totally worth the money.  Ive not used my foundation brush since the beauty Blender has come into my life ;)</li>
    <li> Love using this wet as it&#x27;s a liquid foundation saver and blends it beautifully into the skin! Holding it is sometimes a little awkward.</li>
    <li> Love using these.  Can&#x27;t say for sure if the huge price is worth the upgrade from the typical wedge sponge, but what I can say is that it works well and doesn&#x27;t leave lines.  It is a bit awkward to hold at first.  Overall, good purchase.</li>
    <li> Their eco-friendly idea is really nice but, I wouldn&#x27;t say this is the ultimate makeup sponge.&lt;br /&gt;It is really smooth and the shape is creative. However, for me, the size was somewhat awkward and didn&#x27;t seem to apply my liquid foundation evenly.&lt;br /&gt;Since I bought the applicators almost a year ago, I used them about 10 times.. So, I probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> The beauty blender is AMAZING!!!! I absolutely love it.  It helps my foundation go on smoothly and evenly. (Almost like an air brushed look) I would highly recommend using the beauty blender!</li>
    <li> LOVE my beauty blender and could not live without it now.</li>
    <li> I am a new convert to liquid foundation and have applied powder foundation with a round brush for years. I read good reviews about this applicator and gave it a try. The results have been incredible; it truly does look like an airbrush application every time.</li>
    <li> love these sponges they are amazing I totally recommend to purchase them you wont be disappointed great quality  Flawless Face</li>
    <li> Just, yes... believe the hype people! Prior to these sponges, I actually used the elf flat top powder brush to put on my liquid foundation (that elf brush btw is an excellent product as well). However, the bad thing about brushes, it that it is somewhat of an ordeal to wash them, and then you have to wait for them to dry. I am quite lazy, so in all honesty, my brushes do not get cleaned often enough. So enter these cute sponges. Number one, they DO give you better control of liquid foundation, allowing you to avoid the streaking from brushes, but also allowing you to slowly layer your makeup. I work in medicine, so I primarily do very lightweight, barely there, natural and conservative makeup. This is PERFECT for that type of application. However, if you want super heavy coverage, you can achieve that as well by tapping on additional layers. With heavier coverage, it still manages to look airbrushed.    But the most beautiful thing about this product, is that it is great for lazy people like me! Cleaning the sponge is ridiculously easy. After each use, I just squeeze on a little face or hand soap, get it sudsy and wring it out like a regular sponge. The cool thing is that it doesn&#x27;t even have to dry completely when you use it next since it is meant to be used damp. It does dry more quickly than a brush, so that is also a plus. The plastic container can also act as a \\&quot;drying station\\&quot;. Inside the container -  there is a small plastic ledge with an opening in the center, when your sponge is wet, it expands to twice the size, so it doesn&#x27;t fall through the hole, so it can have Airflow under and above the sponge to help it dry! I don&#x27;t know if this was an intentional design, but I think it&#x27;s beautiful. Being able to clean your foundation tool daily is so much more convenient and hygenic compared to a brush, and it is less wasteful than using disposable sponges. It is also much more convenient for travel as it takes up way less space than a foundation brush, and can alsodouble as a concealer brush.    One thing I did want to mention, I too have had some mild staining on the sponge from liquid foundation. It is mild, and does not take away my love for this product. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some tips online somewhere on how to really remove the foundation stain, if you were so inclined and are that much of a neat freak :)    Another note, for those who are not accustomed to using makeup sponges, it&#x27;s best to go on youtube and watch a tutorial as the technique is different. Your makeup can still look uneven and streaky if you do not use the sponge with the proper technique.    Definitely holy grail, desert island worthy!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a must to have applicator for foundation and concealer ... You have to get your own beauty blender and you will see the difference</li>
    <li> I love the beautyblender! I had tried them before but was looking for a cheaper option and came upon these! They are authentic and work great! The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was my container was bent a little but it didn&#x27;t affect the products inside so its ok!</li>
    <li> Every girl should have this in their make up collection ! Makes your foundation application flawless ! And blends extremely well ! Ladies you won&#x27;t be disappointed !</li>
    <li> Using this sponge spreads makeup on my my face easier &amp; looks good.  I like it very much. So easy to apply your makeup when you use this sponge.</li>
    <li> I saw people on youtube using it and thought I would give it a try well I am glad I did, I will never use anything else to apply my foundation, I love these sponges.</li>
    <li> The sponge is very good but it soaks up alot of makeup foundation not good especially if the foundations you buy are very expensive.</li>
    <li> Works great as i expected</li>
    <li> I have been on the fence about trying the beauty blender. I have watched numerous upon numerous videos on the Beauty Blender and always had my doubts. There were a lot of sanitary questions and questions about the sponge itself absorbing a lot of product versus placing product on your skin. I finally bit the bullet and purchased this dual pack (for less than what is would cost at a retail carrier) and I must say I am VERY impressed. What normally would go on a little heavier and thicker with a brush or my hands, goes on a bit more sheer but with full coverage. It truly IS worth all of the hype and I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I discovered BeautyBlender about 6 months ago. I always used regular sponges. This product is by far the best. A staple in my everyday makeup application. Arrived quickly and authentic.</li>
    <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t know what the hype was about a little sponge shaped like an egg, but thought I would take a risk. Boy, am I happy I did! This little egg is my go-to to apply liquid foundation! It blends out the makeup flawlessly so there are no lines, like you would see with some brushes. I definitely recommend the Beautyblender for anyone who is serious about their makeup looking great!</li>
    <li> Ultimate way to apply makeup.  These look rather small, but upon becoming wet, they swell to a fairly large size and do not drip.  Great idea and a must for anyone, and they also last several months if you take care of them.</li>
    <li> These were NOT authentic Beauty Blender&#x27;s in this package. They were knock off versions. Completely different feel and application then authentic Beauty Blenders. I put them side by side with one purchased from Sephora and it was not the same.</li>
    <li> The pack of 2 sold on Amazon is smaller than original size so beware if you are seeking the larger original sized product. Amazing sponge and great for those who use traditional or airbrush foundations - esthetcian in CA</li>
    <li> The beauty blender is a must have for every makeup lover.  It makes you foundation blend in effortlessly.  Just dampen the sponge and tap the foundation into your skin and you get a perfect finish every time.  This two-pack is a great deal.  I kept one and gave the other to my daughter.</li>
    <li> Best for doing exactly what it says...Blending!! It deserves all the hype is receives! Makeup Artist Tip: Clean by rubbing it with a solid bar soap, and its just like new, then let air dry.</li>
    <li> It is a great tool for applying foundation. It gives a very even coverage and very easy to use. I love this product.</li>
    <li> These sponges are amazing- I&#x27;ve ised them for years. Don&#x27;t fall for knock offs they simply do not stand up to the original beauty blender. If you keep them clean they last forever- I use the beauty blended cleanser a d they come out good as new. These were delivered quickly and are authentic brand items.</li>
    <li> this is the most amazing product. In love with the beautyblender sponge. It works awesome and makes concealer flawless on the skin. This is a highly recommended makeup tool that everyone must have. Will totally purchase again. A++++++ quality. MUST HAVE!</li>
    <li> love it! I tried the real technique sponge, but nothing is compared to the beauty blender.</li>
    <li> These are pricey and yet well worth the money spent. Blending your foundation is excellent. Some say you use more makeup when you use these sponges...I actually use way less foundation using these beauty blenders. A little goes a long way. Just make sure you wet and squeeze water out of them before applying foundation..flawless finish since using.</li>
    <li> These are fun and easy to clean.  They blend makeup well, but I still need a brush for some areas.</li>
    <li> BeautyBlender&#x27;s have been a staple of mine for years and the price for this two pack was too hard to resist.&lt;br /&gt;The blenders are easy to use - all about the &amp;#34;stpple&amp;#34; style application, but I was surprised that these were smaller than remembered, about 3/4 of the Beauty Blender I get in SEphora. Nonetheless, they are still super useful and like having them around</li>
    <li> I have to say I was sceptical in purchasing the beauty blender but it&#x27;s worth it. It really blends and perfects your foundation in your skin. It&#x27;s soft and bounces smoothly on your skin</li>
    <li> Good as always. How can a beauty blender not be?!</li>
    <li> These are 100% fake. DO NOT buy them. You can get them at Sephora.com for a cheaper price.</li>
    <li> Fake sponges. Could tell from opening the package something was off..went ahead and tried them and the sponge was entirely too rough and irritated my skin! I&#x27;ve been using beauty blenders for almost 2 yrs now and I can definitely tell the difference!</li>
    <li> Love this little tool.  I used to use a brush to put on foundation which always left feather marks.  This item fixes that problem.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Not sure how I was applying makeup before without it!  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now.</li>
    <li> these are wonderful for putting on foundation. I can&#x27;t believe I ever did it with my hands after using these! Nice even application.. always.</li>
    <li> Cant beat the original beauty blender! Blends makeup flawlessly, whether it be liquids or powder.  None of the dupes can compare.  Great price for 2!</li>
    <li> I admit I have a makeup obsession, eyeshadow and lipstick in every shade, eyelashes, all of it.  I tried this little gem after seeing reviews on it.  Love that I am using less of my foundation, saving me $$. It gives a air brushed look to my face. It can be a little tricky at first so definately watch the tutorial video on their web site, huge help. Also don&#x27;t use it for the first time before work or if your in a time crunch, once you get rhythm down your fine. My only problem with it is it leaves little specks of foam on my face. Easily wiped of with the hand but annoying and the reason for the 4 stars. Still not annoying enough that I stop using it daily.  Two tips: squeezing out less water makes it great for a sheer summer coverage.  I use j&amp;j baby wash to clean my makeup sponge and brushes.  Works great, gentle and less $$$ than the brand cleanser.</li>
    <li> It is great for most foundations, blending concealer, and especially for blending around areas like your nose or eyes.&lt;br /&gt;This sponge is the best one I have ever tried so far!I was advised to try it by many Youtube Guru&#x27;s and they did not steer me wrong it is truly amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend purchasing a two pack it&#x27;s a better value.</li>
    <li> Best buy ever. Totally worth the money. My makeup application is now super smooth and completely effortless. Saved me lots of time on my makeup routine!!!</li>
    <li> this is the best way to put on foundation .. !!! love it and now i see on tv all the celebrities using the same one .. awesome</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for works great</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. A M A Z I N G.  Not sure if the knock off ones work as well, but this is def. worth the $$. NOTHING blends as well as this sponge - nothing.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It is very durable, washable, and applies even coats of my foundation! I will continue to buy this product but it does last a long time and is reusable. I love the antimicrobial feature of this product.</li>
    <li> Although a bit pricey, I&#x27;m so glad I spent the money. I did a lot of research on the Beauty Blender and all the dupes out there. This thing is so foolproof. I&#x27;ve used it with liquid and cream foundation and it worked beautifully with both. It&#x27;s very easy to clean, also. Looooove it!</li>
    <li> The beautyblender is exactly what people say it is! A wonderful way to apply your makeup! It is super simple and my make up looks flawless!!</li>
    <li> These beauty blenders are amazing!! Very soft and applies the foundation/concealer w/o moving the product around on your face.  Worth the money!</li>
    <li> I love the beauty blender.  I had seen this in magazines and that all of the celebrities were using it.  Every time I went to Sephora to buy one, they were sold out.  So I purchased two on Amazon Prime and had it in two days.  No other makeup sponge comes close to applying your foundation and concealer as well as the beauty blender!</li>
    <li> I would suggest using your (clean) hands to blend your foundation first before using this sponge as it is quite absorbent. It&#x27;s a bit better than manicare&#x27;s blending sponges. Although I&#x27;n sure lovemakeupUK sells some equally good dupes at a 1/4 the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prefer sponges to brushes bec they are softer and gentler, I have sensitive skin so it always hurts when I use brushes, even in a gentle stippling motion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very soapy when you wash it too- be sure to wash all the suds out to prolong the lifespan! Very pleased with prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! Flawless finish &amp; easy application. Because of it I wear foundation more often. It applies light coverage which I love, but it&#x27;s easy to build up color if your wanting a heavier coverage.  Leaves no streaks like a brush might.</li>
    <li> This sponge is fantastic!  I am still learning to use it correctly, but the way it is shaped helps insure even application of my makeup on the contours of my face.  It cleans up easily and dries quickly.</li>
    <li> I have always heard good things about the beauty blender.  I have also been pretty happy with my brushes for foundation and concealer.So I never really gave the Beauty Blender the time of day.  I also had a &amp;#34;similar&amp;#34; sponge and figured it is probably very similar.  Well it is NOT SIMILAR AT ALL!!! Ii can honestly say, hands down, the beauty blender is the best beauty product I have ever tried. You have to wet it completely and sqeeze out the water,  The sponge will get about 2 times larger.  It is extremely soft.  It will squish down very tiny when you sqeeze the water out and then puff right back up to a nice large size. I put some foundation on a small tray or you can use the back of your hand.  Then I dip the wet beauty blender(I use the bottom-the widest part) into the foundation and begin to smooth it over my face.  Within seconds I could see that this was going to be fabulous.  It glides on your skin like butterer and a little bit of foundation goes a long way!!!!  My face looked airbrushed.  I use the other side (the pointed side) to dip into my concealer.  It workds like a dream getting into the inner corner of your eye to the outter corner of your eye, Down the side of your nose and arround your nostrills to cover any reddness you might have  From there you have a flawless canvass to set with powder, add some lip gloss and off you go.  Or your ready to add all your other makeup products and complete a stylish look.  I love my Beauty Blender and I will never use anything else to apply my makeup again! This will also make a great gift!  Any makeup lover will love it!  Get your now!  You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Amazon is amazing for selling it for almost half the price of what it would be at Sephora! It amazes me some people would buy one blender for 20 when you could get two for a few dollars more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, before the beautyblender, I was a pretty grubby child and just used my fingers to spread my foundation everywhere. It was actually not too bad but it gets your fingers super dirty before you even do anything else like eyeshadow. Brushes always left weird streaks, which I would have to smooth out with my fingers (I think this is why I transitioned to full on fingers). It was a difficult time, and this sponge made everything better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just so easy to apply! The sponge is pretty large, imo, and much more efficient than my tiny girl fingers. Now, it takes me a good 20 seconds to put on my foundation and move on to the next step.&lt;br /&gt;And with the beautyblender cleanser, it&#x27;s super easy to clean. You just squeeze a few times and voila, clean for the next week!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard about Beautyblender for quite some time.  Not sure why it took me so long to try these out.  Since I&#x27;m always on the look out for new ways to apply my foundation. But I&#x27;m glad I finally got my hands on these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With time I changed the way I use it. At first I would apply the foundation with the brush and than blend.  However with time I became more comfortable with it. So now what I do is slightly dampen it and apply foundation/liquid moisturizer directly using it. And I gotta say these do the job perfectly well. I use the pointier end of the blender under my eyes after I just applied concealer with my fingers. This sponge blends everything smoothly and beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I took out one star is for budgetary reasons. First reason is the obvious high cost of the blenders.  Make up sponges are available for fraction of the cost in the pharmacy, and I&#x27;m not saying they would do as good of a job, but for someone on tight budget that could be a much better option.  Another reason is the fact that these blenders just like any other sponges absorb a lot of product. So if you decide to use these, expect the small bottles of foundation to last less amount of time than normally, and hence more burden on your pockets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great foundation/concealer/blender tool, as long as not on a very tight budget.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s totally worth the money. You won&#x27;t find any other reasonable price than Amazon</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a beauty consultant and do makeup on the side.  I saw makeup artist Robert Jones use the Beauty Blender in his tutorials, and I so I ordered a set.  I love it!  The soft texture blends foundation well, and fast.  I swipe foundation on for sheer coverage, and stipple (pat) in one spot if I need to cover up a blemish.  I dampen it, so it does not soak up so much foundation (waste of product).  I&#x27;ve used brushes in the past and they leave strokes.  This product makes the foundation look airbrushed and flawless.  I highly recommend.  I use baby shampoo to wash them, as it is gentle enough to use on sponges and brushes.  I recommend getting this product through Amazon when they have deals.  It&#x27;s not a mainstream product yet, so it&#x27;s usually double the price anywhere else.  I&#x27;ve purchased a two-pack on Amazon for $20.  Great deal!</li>
    <li> i love everything bout this..it feels so good wen you wet it it becomes bigger.great to apply foundation.like a makeup artist i do recommend this</li>
    <li> I love my beautyblender, my make-up goes on very smooth and looks flawless. Very easy to use and to clean.</li>
    <li> Love love love this thing it&#x27;s really the deal.It is no comparison to anything.Its soft bouncy and omg it just feels great on my hands and face.It leaves my makeup lookin flawless!!</li>
    <li> These are amazing!!! I thought the &amp;#34;dupe&amp;#34; I had worked just as well. I WAS WRONG. These are insane! I will never go back to the 2$ sponges.&lt;br /&gt;I bought them from the seller Whole Goods Market, and everything went smoothly!</li>
    <li> I love my BeautyBlender! I use it to apply foundation and I find it makes the finish smooth and even. People have asked me what kind of foundation I use, but I laugh and tell them it&#x27;s not the foundation, it&#x27;s the BeautyBlender. Best price is on Amazon too!</li>
    <li> I love it, is very easy  and fast to apply The base foundation, my skin look nice . I give five star because is easy to use it for everything</li>
    <li> I always thought these were going to be one of those overrated beauty items but I am so glad to find out that they are worth the hype!  They give you such a natural finish and no cakey makeup ever.  Amazing price and shipped quickly.  Will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> such a good deal, love this sponge. make my makeup look flawless and i love using the tip w my concealer. it does a lot in one, expensive but on amazon you get one free practically. the ONLY way i will buy it</li>
    <li> Bought the two pack, then found out that there&#x27;s fakes of this obviously. Argh. I think I got a real one because the little specifics about it from the answers section checks out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does blend foundation very well if you use it as directed, I didn&#x27;t notice less use of foundation than with a foundation brush though. It did go on noticeably more even and natural-looking than with a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BeautyBlender is also a PAIN to clean. I figured I&#x27;d clean it daily after use to prevent bacteria buildup and breakouts, but to my utter disappointment no soap worked on it until I caved in and bought the blendersolid cleaner. The foundation bled out with a bit of pink with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the BB is nice to have and delivers a nice, even look. Just be ready to buy the BB specific cleaner or you&#x27;ll give yourself a headache cleaning it.</li>
    <li> PROS&lt;br /&gt;- Achieves an airbrush look!&lt;br /&gt;- Gives more control over amount of makeup that is applied.&lt;br /&gt;- More hygienic (because it is used damp, I am more inclined to clean it because I am not worried about drying time)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- Does seem to absorb a bit more makeup than a synthetic brush.&lt;br /&gt;- Does tend to get discolored depending on the makeup used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS&lt;br /&gt;- I like to use a synthetic brush first to apply foundation, use the tapered end with foundation and stipple all the areas that need it, use the large end with some foundation to smooth out any streaks and get that airbrushed look&lt;br /&gt;- Use the Beauty Blender Gel Cleanser or Solid to clean both the Beauty Blender and brushes. (I prefer the Solid.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would HIGHLY recommend the Beauty Blender!</li>
    <li> love this!! it makes applying makeup a breeze. i have not used my foundation brush ever since I got it and it&#x27;s ideal to blend concealer and highlighter.</li>
    <li> These makeup sponges are unlike any other makeup sponge! They blend your liquid foundation makeup beautifly! They are great to use with tinted moisturizer as well. I will NEVER use any other makeup sponge again... I cannot live without these now!!!</li>
    <li> This sponge really is amazing for just being a sponge.  It creates a flawless finish for my foundation and concealer. I did have to give it 4 stars though for the price.  Even though I love how this product works, next time around I am most likely going to be purchasing a dupe of this product for much less</li>
    <li> I have been a Bare Minerals user for years now and haven&#x27;t used liquid foundation since I was a teen.  I ended up trying a new liquid makeup and needed a good applicator.  The reviews on the sponge were so good and despite the price I decided to try it.  I don&#x27;t use the liquid foundation everyday but when I do I use this sponge and it is really awesome.  You get two in a pack and after using it several times now I think it was worth the money.</li>
    <li> I really really love how flawless my foundation looked! The only thing I was bummed about was how easily they rip? I dont know if I got a defective one but it ripped on my first wash :(.</li>
    <li> This blender sponge is wonderful.  It blends beautifully. I would recommend it for anyone who uses a liquid foundation.&lt;br /&gt;The sponge blends my entire face with all the hard to blend places.</li>
    <li> These little sponges are a must have for all makeup lovers. Easy to clean and great blending capability for foundation and concealer. Get one today!</li>
    <li> The BEST way to apply your makeup. I don&#x27;t know how I got by all these years without this! It is way better than using a brush, a cheap sponge, or your fingers. I know it is pricey for a makeup sponge, but after reading negative reviews about the generic brands I decided to spend the extra on the original brand. It was well worth the price. It has been about 3 months and they are going strong. I am very happy with this purchase and will definitely be buying more of these in the future.</li>
    <li> These make-up sponges are pricey but really worth the money. The egg shape makes them perfect to get around the eye and nose area. The only con,  is when I went to clean them it takes longer to get the old make-up out than the other make-up sponges that I have used.</li>
    <li> 1st off -&lt;br /&gt;There is no such thing as a dupe for the Beautyblender!﻿ Instead of buying $20 worth of so-called dupes that you hate, just buy the real thing. There is NOTHING like it. The only people bashing it, are those who never tried it. You never see a Beautyblender owner whining about the cost - That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Beautyblender applies foundation faster than anything and very evenly. I&#x27;ve been using mine for 6 months and it has a lot of life left. It blends in concealer on top of foundation beautifully. It gets in everywhere effortlessly. It&#x27;s uniquely soft, and smooth, and holds the perfect amount of moisture start to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: To extend the life, Clean it BEFORE each use - that way you only have to go through the wetting process once rather than one time before makeup application and again after you&#x27;ve used it. It makes any foundation &amp; concealer work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have time to clean it, You *can* get away with using it 3 or 4 times before you REALLY have to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Experiment: I used 5 different long wearing, full coverage foundations 5 days in a row. Each time, it applied perfectly despite not being washed in between any of the 5 applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Wash: Wet it, slide it across a wet bar of soap, and massage. Repeat until 100% of the stain is gone. It DOES come clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps someone! If you&#x27;re on the fence - go for it!</li>
    <li> Love em. Except the makeup won&#x27;t clean off and after I bought here found em somewhere else for 5$</li>
    <li> I have been using beauty products for many years and I have found many makeup sponges but I regard this product as the best I have used thus far. I am a big fan of multiple makeup websites and makeup advisers as I consider myself a makeup connoisseur. I love that the Beauty Blender is not like any normal makeup sponge, it gets much bigger when soaked in water. The texture of the sponge feels nice compared to other products that I have used. I mainly use this sponge everyday with my foundation and when I am finished, it looks almost professionally done.</li>
    <li> I had previously bought the off brand at a local drug store and it was damaged very quickly. Once you get the actual blender you can tell the difference. How it expands when wet where as off brand does not. Be careful when you clean it so that when you squeeze it you arent squeezing with a closed fist because your nails can cut and damage the blender.</li>
    <li> Beauty blender is phenomenal, but the real kicker here is this insane steal, two beauty blenders essentially for the price of one from any other retailer!!</li>
    <li> I really love these little guys. It blends foundation real good. I would highly recommend this product and its wash soap because it easily washes the dirt off from the sponge.</li>
    <li> Sure it gets my makeup on, I&#x27;m not saying it doesn&#x27;t work, but it&#x27;s not a miracle. With proper brush/finger/makeup sponge usage I get similar results too. I use this for my concealer and it stains the sponge, not sure how to get it off..seems permanent. Its not too good for my powder foundation though.</li>
    <li> These seem to be fake. The dye came off on the first wash. It took several pumps of liquid foundation to cover my whole face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried some of Beauty Blender dupes (CVS, Target, RT, Sephora brand) and was never overly impressed. I watched a lot of videos on application processes and read reviews on tons of fakes. The other day I was in the middle of a giant Sephora shopping spree and tossed the Beauty Blender in their mid-way, thinking that I&#x27;d spent at least $20 on fakes trying to like them, I might as well spend the $20 on the real thing and see how it compares. There really isn&#x27;t a comparison. None of the dupes feel this soft or are this lightly squishy. None of them expand as much as the real one when when. Finally, none of them give me close to the look that the real Beauty Blender does. My MAC foundation looks invisible on my skin but still covers all my redness and acne, which is pretty much a miracle. I like MAC but they aren&#x27;t exactly known for the natural look. I soak it til it expands, squeeze out the water, then roll it up in a hand towel and press it. Then I put my foundation on the back of my hand and dip the fat end of the Beauty Blender in the makeup and just dab/bounce it all over my face. I also used the pointy end with my MAC concealer under my eyes, over Benefit&#x27;s Stay Don&#x27;t Stray, and the near disappearance of my dark circles is another miracle. Again I put the concealer on my hand, dip the pointy end in this time, and just dab/bounce it all over my under-eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s overpriced. I&#x27;ve spent well over $20 on nice brushes and I&#x27;ve only liked one of them even remotely as much as the Beauty Blender. I do have to use more product which is the only drawback. I thought I&#x27;d use less given that the point of getting the Beauty Blender wet is that it doesn&#x27;t absorb as much of your makeup as a brush, but I had to use 2 pumps of my foundation where I normally use one or just under one pump. I did NOT need the extra pump for more coverage over redness, I simply needed another pump just to hit the 2nd half of my face. I didn&#x27;t find myself going over the same spot more than once for coverage but I still needed a 2nd pump.ame spot more than once for coverage but I still needed a 2nd pump.</li>
    <li> This is such a great value, because you are basically getting two beauty blenders for the price of one. I can&#x27;t do my makeup without the beauty blender. It truly does make your make apply a thousand times better then any other sponge of brush. I know that it seems like this sponge is really expensive, but if you are a makeup junky like me, this is a must have for applying foundations, concealers, and even powders.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately these are not authentic Beauty Blenders. I bought the two pack for nearly half the cost of the typical Beauty Blender, and I usually buy these from Sephora or Birchbox. I have a few dirty authentic Beauty Blenders at home so I had something to compare these to. These sponges that I got came in the authentic packaging but the sponge itself is for sure a knock off. The texture is much more firm than the original. These knock offs aren&#x27;t bad, I will still use them, it just goes to show that some deals are too good to be true.</li>
    <li> these little things make foundation application so much easier! and blending concealer is a dream! I love these little multi-use sponges.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I have tried this sponge as well as a no-name brand sponge and this one is definitely better. Although the price is steep for a simple sponge, it&#x27;s still worth it as it works wonders when I apply my liquid foundation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this sponge is washed and maintained properly, it should last you about 2 months. I like to swap mine out as the texture gets rough and it begins to look really dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this sponge wet (squeezed and patted dry) and apply a small amount of foundation to the top of my hand. I dab the sponge on the foundation and using light, dabbing motions, apply the foundation to my face. The pointed tip is great for around the eye and nose area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product in place of a regular makeup sponge or brush.</li>
    <li> I purchased my BeautyBlenders on here from Valurie Beauty (spelling may be off) about a year ago or so. I thought I was getting real BeautyBlenders, since the price was the same as Sephora but I just decided to get them on here since I was buying some other items. Well, after purchasing a few real BeautyBlender at Sephora I can definitely say these were fake or at least reject sponges that didn&#x27;t meet up to quality control. Kind of disappointed, but I can&#x27;t do anything about it now since it&#x27;s been over a year. I wish I had known sooner and used the same amount of money to buy real BeautyBlenders from Sephora.</li>
    <li> I have read some of the reviews that said these are fakes.  I don&#x27;t know about that but, they work very well.  They are very soft on the face, blend makeup excellently and the price for two is outstanding.</li>
    <li> So many positive reviews have written about these all over the internet so I had to try them. I received a much better deal on Amazon than I would have at Sephora so I was able to give the extra one received to my mother for her to try. I have to say I&#x27;m really pleased with how my concealer is blended effortlessly and they&#x27;ve really improved the appearance of my complexion.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for blending make up! I use it for foundation and concealer! It is way cheaper than Sephora and it is the SAME product! I only wish I had not wasted my time on knock-offs of the Beauty Blender, nothing compares to this one!</li>
    <li> I NEVER thought all those things I heard about this little sponge were true! but they are! this is amazing!! it works wonders with any type of prduct you put on your face. It is worth the price!</li>
    <li> Love it! My foundation looks flawless! No streaking like you get with a brush! Be sure to keep the packaging to store extra sponge &amp; dry sponge you are currently using.</li>
    <li> Love the product but it only last for a month before it starts wearing. Get the 2 pack!! It&#x27;s a must have in my makeup.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! Allows you to use less makeup and have a flawless coverage! I&#x27;ve recommended to all my fam and friends!</li>
    <li> I love using the beauty blender! My makeup looks like it has been airbrushed. I would say that this is a staple for everyone&#x27;s makeup kit.</li>
    <li> These things are amazing.  My makeup looks so much more natural when I use these, it goes on smoothly and it doesn&#x27;t look caked on at all.  I had been using powder foundations before just because I was so afraid of my makeup looking too fake, but I don&#x27;t worry about that anymore.</li>
    <li> At least one of these is fake, maybe both. They are not even the same color or shape. The packaging on the inside was completely upside down, meaning the sponges were falling around loose on the bottom, and the pedestal part was on top AND upside down. This obviously was tampered with, and then they stuck an Allure sticker on it to make it look like it had not been opened. Do not buy from ToysNGamesEtc.</li>
    <li> This beauty blender really does apply all my liquid foundations very well.  Love how it goes into all the areas of the face and blends seamlessly</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so confused. I compared my beauty blender to 3 other friends that bought theirs from sephora and the fabric didn&#x27;t look or feel the same. It also expands much bigger than theirs. The confusing part comes in the fact that it still works GREAT. It gives my skin a nice airbrushed finish. I wash it with a face wash everyday after use so it retains it&#x27;s bright pink color. My friends actually like mine much better. I&#x27;m not sure if I should be upset because it&#x27;s not the same as the one at sephora or happy that it works just as good. Maybe it&#x27;s just the one that I got that&#x27;s different. I&#x27;m going to try ordering it again to see if the next ones the same way. A friend and I bought this together so we could each have one and split the cost so we could save money!</li>
    <li> I am editing my review because I just saw the case and had not tested the item yet. It is not the original. I still have one original one with me and it is way softer, it absorbs water differently and it shrinks back. This one stayed practically the same size. I am really upset :(</li>
    <li> This is NOT  a beauty blender!</li>
    <li> I was slightly hesitant to purchase the Beauty Blender through Amazon instead of through Sephora based on the reviews I had read on here about issues with non-authentic merchandise, but I took the dive (purchased mine from Day Dream) and was not disappointed. You are getting such a huge deal on the duo set because it is only a few dollars more than a single sponge at Sephora or Ulta! WOOHOO! I recently switched from using a mineral foundation to a liquid (mineral foundations just can not control the oil slick that is my face) and was having difficulties finding the best way to apply liquid. I have super sensitive skin and using my fingers really seemed to irritate my skin so I tried one of Sephora&#x27;s Pro foundation brushes and really did not like the finish it gave my skin. After watching YouTube tutorial after YouTube tutorial, I decided to try the Beauty Blender and I am so glad I did. It gives me the look of naked skin, so I don&#x27;t look like I have a ton of foundation of my face! Plus I don&#x27;t have to use nearly as much foundation as I did with a brush. I dot a small amount on my face and let it warm up, then pat the dampened sponge all over my face, blending in my foundation. If I need more coverage, I just add a bit more and slowly build. Works like a dream!&lt;br /&gt;When I washed it the first time, I did have some slight pink bleeding but it hasn&#x27;t done that since the first wash. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it falling apart or tearing. I&#x27;ve had it for almost a month now and have only used one sponge and it is still in great shape. Overall, highly recommended for those using liquid foundation though I&#x27;ve seen it used with powder as well.</li>
    <li> they are amazing and they give a air brush finis if you use them properly I just love these sponges!</li>
    <li> OMG! Why did I hesitate about this product?&lt;br /&gt;It´s amazing. I #BeautyBlender YOU.&lt;br /&gt;The sponge is little, once you damp it gives you a great coverage with so little makeup foundation.&lt;br /&gt;I´m going to save money on makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Note: Order the cleanser too. It´s worth the investment.</li>
    <li> EVERYTHING WAS GOOD. I LIKE THIS PRODUCT ALOT.I WILL PURCHASE AGAIN IF I NEED MORE.&lt;br /&gt;WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY. :-D</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been experimenting with make-up for too long, but this product has changed my entire application process. The beauty blender is a godsend and it helps to eliminated unsightly lines. This product came with 2 sponges in the bright pink color, they are easy to use, only takes, seconds and leaves ur makeup perfectly pressed into your skin as opposed to smeared or caked on.</li>
    <li> I had this on my wishlist and my husband bought it for me for Christmas. Only 1 sponge came in the package! Real deal, but just 1.</li>
    <li> These are much better than regular make up sponges, Gives a flawless look with ease every time. Also easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I have used this blender in the past and loved it but my new one ripped right away !! 😣</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  You have to wet it, squeeze out the excess water, and it feels good, but I felt that it absorbed too much of my product.  I would much rather use a nice brush.  It cosmetics has the most awesome foundation brush I have ever used.</li>
    <li> BeautyBlenders have always, and will always be my favorite way to apply concealer, foundation, and other creme products. I have used them continuously for almost 5 years now. There is no dupe that can replace the consistency of it, seriously just invest the money in these and you don&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I initially purchased a dupe from Sephora, but the real Beauty Blender seems to work so much better for me. Apparently it looks tasty too, as my 3-year old niece bit off the tip of the sponge. Thankfully she didn&#x27;t try to ingest it.</li>
    <li> The best beautyblenders - don&#x27;t bother buying any of the other brands.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot! At first, I thought it wasn&#x27;t real, because it wasn&#x27;t tripling in size like it was supposed to, but I just wasn&#x27;t soaking enough water into it. It tripled in size and worked much better after that!</li>
    <li> so I have heard beauty gurus on yt rave about this I tried a dupe b4 this and the dupe I didn&#x27;t care for it now once I ordered this and tried it for the first time OMG  is all I can say I love this and wanna buy more so I never run out, plus I have told all my friends and family who are also looking to try it out.</li>
    <li> They do a good job blending my foundation, but in my opinion, they do not live up to the hype. I prefer my brushes.</li>
    <li> Great quality, I&#x27;ve had mine forever. They last and last if you keep them clean and are gentle when you wash them. Great for under eye concealer but takes practice with foundation</li>
    <li> Tried all the cheaper things before buying this.. seems like it was wasted money and should have just bought this in the first place. make sure you buy the soap to prolong it&#x27;s life.</li>
    <li> Fake !! Not the real one the ones I received were hard and really annoying !! Upset I spent money on this</li>
    <li> I have purchased other beauty sponge &#x27;dupes&#x27; trying to replace these, simply to save money.  I have to say that none of them come close to the quality of makeup application like beautyblender sponges do.  I&#x27;ll come back to these over and over, and can&#x27;t beat the amazon price!</li>
    <li> The sponge is probably fake. It turned black with mold after only 1 month. Yes, I do clean it with the Beauty Blender Solid Cleanser and I even put it in the Airport to dry.</li>
    <li> Great deal! The beauty blenders are awesome!! Use it wet every day for applying my cream/liquid foundation! Will be repurchasing more when mine become worn out.</li>
    <li> Rest assured that these are genuine brand Beautyblender sponges. Not fake items as others have posted. Purchased mine by following a link attached to Kandee Johnson&#x27;s webpage. (She&#x27;s a YouTube makeup video blogger.) You will receive 2 sponges in one package. Each sponge resembles an egg (shape) and their original size is approx to one also. To use, saturate the sponge with water so that it expands to twice it&#x27;s size. Squeeze out all excess water. After applying foundation, you will take the flat/bottom end of sponge and QUICKLY pat your face to press in makeup all over your face. There are videos uploaded on YouTube to help you understand more clearly:-) Overall, it&#x27;s a good product. Foundation looks smooth and not cakey. Not a miracle applicator by any means.</li>
    <li> yes these are legit beauty blender! I use mine dry and wet. Dry for concealer. wet for foundation. Looks just like the picture so dont be scared!</li>
    <li> Makes a huge difference in the finish of your make up. I will never use anything else but Beautyblender. They are washable and last a long time.</li>
    <li> I debated buying this sponge applicator for a very long time and I shouldn&#x27;t have waited around!  Applying my makeup is now such a breeze and is better blended than it ever has been before. Make sure you read the instructions on how to use it so you know to wet it down first.</li>
    <li> OMG! This blender is amazzzzing! Totally worth the money. I have been putting off buying this because of the price and I have been buying Real techniques and other cheaper brands but finally gave in to the hype and thought that this was a good deal$23 for 2.Well,I&#x27;m buying more, nothing compares to this blender.Love,Love,Love this.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> I am still getting use to using a sponge over a brush. Just dont forget to use it damp for better application.</li>
    <li> These blend so nicely!  I really was skeptical but now that I have used them and compared them to others, I really can&#x27;t imagine using anything else.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 6 months and really like the way it works.  I like that it is small and soft.  In fact, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the price.  It is a tiny product for such a large price. In fact, it was the price that made me buy other similar looking products that cost much less thinking that I really did overpay. However, the other similarly shaped sponges could not compare.  They were bigger and not nearly as soft and pliable and my foundation just did not go on as smoothly, and it did not work as well around the eye area.  So I rate it a 4 out of 5.</li>
    <li> Excellent makeup applicator sponge, WAY better than the knockoff versions (Ulta, CVS, Walgreens, Etc) but steep price at $20+ dollars. Might as well pick up the double pack if you&#x27;re going to buy from Amazon, you&#x27;ll get a better deal buying 2 at a time. I read reviews on makeupalley saying the White didn&#x27;t bleed color like the pink when washing but didn&#x27;t have the same feel so I stuck with the pink and it definelty bleeds pink dye out when rinsing/washing. Have no knowledge of the black version. I use an x-brand from CVS opil-free makup remover followed by Dr Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soap in lavendar to clean the sponge. I wear makeup daily so it needs to be cleaned every day which is a hassle btu truth be told I should be cleaning a brush applicator daily as well. I apply with e.l.f.&#x27;s setting spray ($3 at target/walmart) and the finish is comparable only to the Sigma Flatop kabuki brush. I like thi sbecause you more or less push the foundation onto your skin and so unlike a brush there&#x27;s no aggitation or circular motions that can cause dry patches to sort of exfoliate and lift dead skin up. Excellent tool for those willing to keep up with the maintenance of keeping it clean.</li>
    <li> I love these beauty blenders!  Makes my foundation look airbrushed and flawless.  I will continue to get a beauty blender when these are all used up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used MAC foundation brushes, Kabuki brushes and ordinary foam applicators for years.  Then I found airbrush foundation and thought I&#x27;d never go back to standard liquid foundation again...until I found this cute little pink-foam egg!  The beautyblender sponge actually gives you the airbrushed effect with whatever liquid foundation you use.  My go-to foundations are Make Up Forever&#x27;s HD foundation in N125 (amazing coverage) and Loreal&#x27;s True Match in W4 (for daytime and more sheer coverage) and both of them work like a dream with the beautyblender.  I think the density of the sponge is perfect and the little informational booklet that comes with it, teaching you to &amp;#34;bounce&amp;#34; the sponge over your face was ingenius.  I like that it holds just the right amount of water whereas the typical makeup sponges are so dense, they don&#x27;t even take in water when you wet them.  It makes your foundation cover without cakey-ness or settling into fine lines or flakes from drying zits.  My coverage is awesome no matter which foundation I&#x27;m using.  I got mine at Sephora so I got the real thing but I just wanted to review it because I love it so much!!</li>
    <li> There are tons of different dupes out there but there’s nothing better than the original. The BB is my saving grace, it’s literally the best way to apply makeup. The rounded edges and the damp sponge help give me a dewy, fresh face that you can’t get from using a regular sponge or a foundation brush. The BB absorbs water and doubles in size, something you just won’t get from the copy cat beauty blenders. I honestly don’t know how i lived without this makeup applicator for so long. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so darn expensive! But if you take care of the sponge and wash it you should have no problem using it for awhile.</li>
    <li> I used sponges to apply foundation when I was younger, but I thought they made the foundation go on too thick. These are perfect. They blend the foundation into my skin and I can easily add more coverage where I need to. I wet the sponge, squeeze out excess water, and then dab it with a towel before using.</li>
    <li> These are awesome!! Wouldn&#x27;t do my makeup without them! Little tip: wet them and ring them out. Use sponges damp to apply foundation!!</li>
    <li> The product does what it is supposed to do.  That said, there are plenty of sponges of the same material now on the market for much cheaper/  You pay for the brand name here...</li>
    <li> I really like the application because it leaves no streak marks. I also use a MAC stippling brush to apply my liquid foundation, but I find the sponge gives a more air brush effect. The only complaint I have is that unlike the brush, the sponge absorbs a lot of the product, causing it to be a bit wasteful.</li>
    <li> I work at Sephora and use the BeautyBlender with clients on a regular basis. I ordered the duo thinking it was a great deal but it was too good to be true. They were definitely fake and not the texture of a true BeautyBlender. The seller was &amp;#34;Lock &amp; Mane,&amp;#34; through Amazon Prime, so perhaps it also depends on the seller. The sponges weren&#x27;t shaped quite like the BeautyBlender and they had the texture and softness of a cheap sponge. So sad, but sending back!</li>
    <li> The beautyblender is a fantastic product, but what I received from AMAZON is no beauty blender.  Or it&#x27;s not what they described.  I expected two sponges in the plastic package, as shown and described to be able to give as a gift to my mother for christmas and what I got WAS TWO PINK SPONGES IN A PLASTIC BAGGIE. This is unacceptable crap, and this isn&#x27;t what I have come to expect as an amazon customer.</li>
    <li> I received my beauty blender but when I opened it it&#x27;s a small beauty blender . The picture looks like 2 Large ones .</li>
    <li> Hello&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a beautiful face&lt;br /&gt;concealer&lt;br /&gt;or&lt;br /&gt;foundation&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like magic on my face&lt;br /&gt;I love it</li>
    <li> Product wonderful actually have liked very much</li>
    <li> Love this product! Works way better than even mac foundation or concealer brushes. Will definitely keep ordering this product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be skeptical.  I thought no way am I going to pay $$ for a sponge!  After all raving reviews, I took the sponge plunge!  I&#x27;d used the cheap white wedges from dollar stores, they are sponges, so I thought what could be so great about a pink egg shaped one?  One thing most review don&#x27;t mention is TIME IT SAVES, in addition to yes, indeed, making foundation look much better than you could apply any other way.  I&#x27;d imagine every professional make up artist must use this...Wet sponge under sink, like any sponge, squeeze out excess water, and it is damp.  No big deal at all, you don&#x27;t have to worry about &amp;#34;am I putting too much water on it?&amp;#34; I dabbed the sponge into palm of my hand, where I had poured a small amount of foundation, then started pressing foundation against my face in large dots!  Just apply amount of foundation you usually do.  Then, the miracle!!  LOL Just start rubbing sponge on face, blending the foundation.  It goes on fast, blends fast and beautifully.  I was very descriptive in describing how to do this, but the whole process takes me less than 5 minutes &amp; I have no clue how it works wonders.  The density of sponge, plus the dampness, it just works.  I do take a minute after using it, to run it under hot water, and I use softsoap, just a squirt on it, rub that in, rinse it out.  Make sure you leave it setting out in a spot where it can dry.....If you didn&#x27;t rinse it off regularly, like a sponge in kitchen that stays wet, bacteria would grow.  Some people may cringe at the softsoap, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a makeup cleansing product, but for me, I just wash it out this way, and it works fine.  I did buy 2 since it only cost a little bit more, and I like that.  I&#x27;ve used my extra to apply blush, played with it on toning down, blending eye shadow after applying it, and ALSO I use powder foundation sometimes.  It does work with powdered makeup, with it, I just shake the powder into palm of hand and then just gently dab sponge against it, so it just picks it up, doesn&#x27;t absorb any of it.  Then, instead of dotting on face, I just start gently rubbing in circles.....same result of powder looking more flawless than when I use a brush.  Buy it and enjoy!picks it up, doesn&#x27;t absorb any of it.  Then, instead of dotting on face, I just start gently rubbing in circles.....same result of powder looking more flawless than when I use a brush.  Buy it and enjoy!</li>
    <li> Received in good order and time.  No issues with product quality</li>
    <li> This sponge is totally worth the money. I have purchased very inexpensive sponges in the past and they just are not the same as the Beautyblender. I am so glad I invested in these.</li>
    <li> Honestly my friend told me to get these and I will never go back to using anything else. They work very well, my foundation goes on even and it is even handy to use the tip to apply directly under your eyes.</li>
    <li> These things are amazing for applying my MAC foundation. Will definitely be repurchasing. They last for quite a while for me and are easy to clean. I use them every day!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these beauty blenders! Makes my liquid foundation look flawless!! Can&#x27;t beat the price for 2! Definitely will be repurchasing these!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> the best, it can be used for all types of cosmetic applications!  Its a must! I will never stop buying these stupid little pink sponges!;)</li>
    <li> The best makeup blender. Love it, highly recommended!!! Provide great blending, the shape helps to apply foundation and concealer with great precision living flawless look.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to get this product and then when I finally get it and go to use it, it is worthless. I can&#x27;t believe I paid so much for this junk. I ended up using my stipple  and concealer brush.</li>
    <li> With these, I would not suggest them to anyone who likes full coverage, (like me). For someone who likes sheer, to medium coverage, I say do it. Trying to use this for full coverage was a nightmare for me, lol. They are very easy to use, clean up well, and I do like the way it feels on my face. When using them, I did notice it soaked up a good portion of my makeup, and the amount I wanted to be on my face, just would not take, and would stay in the sponge. Frustrating, considering how much a good foundation costs. I have a scar on the right side of my face that I insist is covered up, and this just could not do the job like my brushes do. I am not saying it is a bad product. I&#x27;m just saying, if you prefer full coverage as I do, it probably would be better not to buy these.</li>
    <li> Pleased to say that the item I ordered was true to form.  I got just what I ordered and received it in a timely manner.  However I wasn&#x27;t as in love with it as everyone seemed to be!  It definitely works well, but I believe brushes was a better choice when applying makeup although this does help blend out better around the hairline.</li>
    <li> Many of my friends have this, and i have heard from youtubers that this is a great product so i decided to try it myself. I have been using brushes for so long and they&#x27;re pretty good for me but i do sometimes get brush strokes from foundation left on my face or even little bristles that just fall off while i&#x27;m applying foundation... So.. first time trying this beautyblender, and i absolutely love it! Foundation went on so smoothly, as well as powder for setting. The sponge works better damp and i thought it would make the foundation come off while while applying it since i felt moisture on my face from the dampness of the beautyblender, but it actually worked great! I&#x27;m glad i purchased two sponges, but i think one might just be enough since it&#x27;s also simple to clean! Might give the other one to my friend!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite tool for applyng foundation. It helps give a flawless finish. When your buy two it is a better value.</li>
    <li> If you want your makeup to look flawless and not caked up then this is the product for you. I swear by it and i can&#x27;t even imagine wearing foundation without using this.</li>
    <li> The beauty blender is amazing! It makes my skin look flawless. This is a must have tool for everyone!</li>
    <li> It is so good that I thrown away all the sponges I&#x27;d had. Blends perfectly well. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Product more wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Product beyond description&lt;br /&gt;I advise everyone Bsthaddamh Genuine First, because he was sure of it personally&lt;br /&gt;I am very wonderful wonderful performance&lt;br /&gt;I loved this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s doing the job, I thought it&#x27;s gonna be better but yeah I like it ;) I&#x27;m not gonna order more</li>
    <li> So easy to use / clean. Makeup applies beautifully and naturally when you use the Beauty Blender. This price was so much better than I could have purchased in retail store locations.</li>
    <li> I received one as a gift two years ago and I have been hooked on this product since then! Makes my liquid foundation blend effortlessly.  I&#x27;ve had one sponge last me approximately 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other similar products and discarded them after the first use.  These are much better than the less expensive versions you find everywhere.</li>
    <li> Loved it! Natural look and feel with no streaks. I&#x27;ve received many compliments. I only wish I would get 4 sponges in stead of 2.</li>
    <li> I love this product, my makeup blends in perfectly :-) I don&#x27;t have that caked on look, or that weird make up line between my face and neck.</li>
    <li> Kept hearing about it; could no longer resist. My verdict? This unassuming little pink sponge is a teardrop shaped piece of magic. I could go on and on singing its praises, but I&#x27;ll spare you and just say that it&#x27;s swoon worthy. Part of me strangely wishes I didn&#x27;t love this as much I do. But I do. I love it a lot. Buy it. Now.</li>
    <li> Very happy about my beauty blender. It applies foundation flawlessly and I wouldn&#x27;t want to do my makeup without it!</li>
    <li> Sponge is fake. I just recieved this sponge about 3 days ago. When I washed the sponge, I squeezed it and my fingernail went into the sponge and a small chunk of the sponge came out. This was only after the second wash! RIDICULOUS! Dont waste your money! Go to sephora.com and get the authentic one!</li>
    <li> I use it damp with foundation to give a flawless finish to my skin. The other one I use dry with translucent powder to finish the look.</li>
    <li> If you want to shear your foundation out, or give an airbrushed finish, this is perfect. Can also be used after a foundation brush to get rid of brush lines and make the foundation look seamless and more skin like.</li>
    <li> Foundation looks flawless and I love the super soft texture of the sponge.</li>
    <li> The packaging is the only real thing about this. It is very common for amazon sellers to buy the product themselves and put a fake product inside and sell or even buy just the packaging and do the same. I am so disappointed but if you really want a great product go to sephora and buy the real deal or go to ulta and buy the real techniques complexion sponge for only 6 dollars. Both are amazing and basically the same except in colors. DON&#x27;T FALL FOR THIS TRAP. there&#x27;s a reason its cheaper here then sephora.</li>
    <li> I really like the Beatyblender and the shipping was fast. I love</li>
    <li> It is true what they say about these blenders.  You can not find a dupe, there is nothing else that works like them and yes, it is also true that it makes your makeup application look fresh and like your skin but better.  Yes, they are expensive but, if you are all about your foundation looking natural, it&#x27;s a good call to invest in this tool.  I use just good quality skin cleanser to wash these and they have done fine .</li>
    <li> I will definitely be buying more beauty blenders, they&#x27;re all I&#x27;ve used since first trying it out.  It&#x27;s actually a durable product and when I throw them out at 3 months it&#x27;s just b/c of bacterial reasons.</li>
    <li> I love the quality of the sponge, its so soft, almost suede like feeling swiping across your face.I love how it makes my skin feel, like I&#x27;m airbrushed the blending is amazing!! $22 for sponges was hard to justify but its worth it if you want a smoother look.</li>
    <li> ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍😍😍😍😍😍I just gotta say I&#x27;m so in love with Thea sponges they are amAIng DEF A MUST BUY FOR MUA</li>
    <li> Love this item and is way cheaper than buying at Sephora. I will buy for people as gifts for sure.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak to the knock off versions of these sponges but this authentic Beautyblender is really nice. I find that there are still times though when my fingertips can get an even better finish on my cream foundation. I have not had issues with keeping this clean but I am faithful to wash it after each use. There are two in the box and I have not had to use the second one- however, I use it infrequently as i don&#x27;t wear foundation everyday so I can&#x27;t speak to how long it might last with daily use and washing. I&#x27;ts a very nice applicator to get a smooth even finish. A bit pricey- but I decided to take the risk of paying for the name brand rather than the risk of the knockoff brands. I don&#x27;t regret my purchase as when this sponge is the tool for the job I don&#x27;t think anything else will do. It gets into the corners around your nose, edges of your eyes and temples and provides a great deal of control in application.</li>
    <li> This sponge is the best one. Excellent produckt!This sponge is the best one My foundation rests evenly on my skin! I think that I will always use this sponge!</li>
    <li> Connect the product was on time and deal with the seller very sophisticated product is worth the experience&lt;br /&gt;Worth 5 stars</li>
    <li> I just received mine, not sure if they are real or not but I applied my makeup with the sponge today and it did a good job so I like it so far.</li>
    <li> The sponges are the best way to apply make up for a flawless finish. Glad I bought two instead of one</li>
    <li> I love these. I always try to go cheaper with the Sephora or store brand ones, am disappointed every time and come crawling back.</li>
    <li> Wonderful&lt;br /&gt;I liked very much</li>
    <li> You can buy cheaper and with the same absorbing quality at local pharmacy.</li>
    <li> This make up blender sponge is the best thing that ever came out. It makes your make up feel nice and done by a professional. I would recommend it to all the ladies to by one and you eons regret it .</li>
    <li> At 2 for $25 or under I think these are definitely worth the price for the real thing. If taken care of (watch your nails when squeezing!) they really do last at least 6 months or more. I have not found the same degree of texture and bounce back in any dupe I tried. [avons discontinued version was close :(  ]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The original truly creates an mess proof and flawless application, especially for any silicone based foundations. I have found that with water based foundations it drinks up more of the foundation I would like and shears it too much for my taste, but it in no way looks bad.</li>
    <li> I love my Beauty Blender Sponges they work amazing on my face, makes my make up look really natural.love this product</li>
    <li> Love these. They are really amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to believe they are nothing like other makeup sponges, but they really are completely different.&lt;br /&gt;These are the BEST.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this product,,especially in those hot summer days...feeling so relaxed and cool down when i apply my liquid foundation with it.It definitely gives kind of natural finish and take down the powerness on your face. I use it to apply my concealer for my under eye dark cirle, edge of my nose as well, the point side can easily get into the small edge of those area which is super flexible. Seriouly can&#x27;t not live without it!!!!</li>
    <li> This sponge blends makeup extremely well! Even if I use a brush I still find myself using this sponge to get a more flawless blend. Works great with liquids and powder. It sets like a powder puff without looking cakey or too dry. It gives a nice finish to the powder when using to set. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it being wet but after dampening it (which I do before showering) let sit and after using the bottom side to blend foundation use the elongated side for setting powder. Also works great for blotting and touch ups.</li>
    <li> After reading several reviews I decided to try it out. It is a little tricky to get use to using if you have never used a sponge before. I myself have always used a brush to apply my foundation. First application was weird. Once I found the right rhythm I actually think I am able to apply my makeup quicker with better coverage! Anyone buying this for the first time will have to find the right method for using it. Everyone uses the sponge differently. However the coverage you will get will be flawless!</li>
    <li> This makeup sponge is great. It makes your liquid makeup look flawless. You soak the sponge in water and then squeeze out all the excess, and then you apply your liquid makeup using quick dabbing motions. The sponges seem pricey but they&#x27;re well worth it!</li>
    <li> This is so worth the money on here! You get 2-for-1 when you compare the price at beauty stores. I absolutely love it. Easy to use and easy to clean. (I just use a gentle anti-bacterial soap.) It is way better than the cheap wedge ones in every aspect. They last longer, blend better, and you have the option of light or full coverage. I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I love the quantity and the price! I use damp brush to apply my concealer with the pointy edge and foundation with other end it always looks flawless</li>
    <li> The quality is above my expectations. It goes perfect with liquid foundation and powder as a finish. Very naturally looking make up without an effort. I Always use it.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with these. Make sure you use it wet for best results :)</li>
    <li> I love the beauty blender !!!!!! I will repurchase this over and over again !!! Foundation goes on like a dream it gives off a airbrush affect. Run the sponge under water squeeze the extra water out then put the sponge wrapped around a towel squeeze again and you are good to go.  I love to use the end of it to blended my full coverage foundation and the pointed side for concealer. The only downside of the beauty blended is that it does stain even after washing it but other then that I would buy this again !!!</li>
    <li> These are fake BeautyBlenders. Not only were they fake, they were not even good fakes. The canister/pedestal was missing and there was no instruction booklet. The package had obviously been opened, and the &amp;#34;blenders&amp;#34; were smashed into the packaging, obviously these fake ones are bigger and a different texture then the real ones. Since Amazon does not sell these themselves and relies on 3rd party sellers, I will not be buying this item from Amazon. Only buy your BeautyBlenders from Sephora or the BeautyBlender site.&lt;br /&gt;This seems to be a common issue with this item, there are quite a few reviews stating receiving fake blenders, and Amazon needs to address this issue with fake items immediately.</li>
    <li> This supplier is not the real beauty blender sponge. I have one for myself and purchased this double pack to give one to my mom and my sister for Christmas because I do really love the REAL beauty blender. These however are not the real sponges. They are hard as a rock, way bigger than the real ones and when put under the water do grow in size but only soften a little bit. Please don&#x27;t waste your time and money on these. They may be slightly cheaper than what you find from real suppliers but trust me the real ones are worth the actual cost. Go to your local sephora or sephora.com, birchbox or the beauty blender website for an authentic sponge.</li>
    <li> Did not arrive in box as pictured, only in plastic bag, so not gift worthy. Sent back.</li>
    <li> ahhhhh! I regret not getting one earlier. The annoying thing is that this will stain from your foundation and will look very messy and ugly. it works really well though</li>
    <li> Great for blending on your face.  However, be careful when you wash it, because the pink bleeds.</li>
    <li> These little sponges are amazing. I have never had such flawless application of my foundation, concealer, and highlighter. I already bought some as gifts for the holidays.</li>
    <li> I dont know what I did before the beauty blender. Of yes I do; I used a crappy foundation brush and didnt get near the flawless airbrushed look the blender gives. Buy it today!</li>
    <li> This has quickly become my favorite tool for makeup application.  I purchased my beauty blenders from the seller &amp;#34;Be Pretty&amp;#34; and they are authentic!! I just LOVE the feeling of the damp sponge on my face when I&#x27;m applying my foundation.  It really helps to wake me up in the mornings and gives my skin a little boost of hydration.  I have used it with multiple liquid foundations - high end and drugstore, and the results are always flawless. NEVER cakey.  My skin looks airbrushed and healthy, and you also get way more out of your foundation with this tool - as it makes a little go a looong way, and no foundation is wasted. I find that depending on the amount of foundation you use, you can achieve sheer coverage or full coverage.  I have tried knock off versions of the beauty blender and NONE of them have even come close.  The beauty blender is SO soft, applying foundation is almost luxurious.  Other versions almost felt like I was punching myself in the face - they were so dense and stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very hesitant about spending this much on a makeup sponge, but it was definitely worth it, and I would do it again in a heartbeat.  If you take care of your beauty blender, it will last you months.  To wash, I just use dawn dish soap mixed with a little olive oil.  The oil breaks down the foundation and conditions the sponge.  I wash mine after about every third use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, buying here on Amazon is a much better deal.  I paid a little over $20 for two sponges, and that&#x27;s about how much you will pay for ONE regularly.  Also - isn&#x27;t the sponge just the cutest!?  I love the pink color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will most definitely repurchase!!</li>
    <li> The Beauty Blender is probably the best method of foundation application that I have ever used.you get it wet first, then squeeze out the excess water and then use the sponge in a bouncing motion all over your face. It provides a seamless and perfect airbrushed looking face. they are a little on the pricey side, but I&#x27;m telling you they are well worth it. Once you have used a beauty blenderr to apply your foundation nothing else will make you happy. I have had several beauty blenders for over a year and they are still in great shape.I refuse to use anything else on my self or my clients.</li>
    <li> Expensive.  I wished I got the real techniques first.</li>
    <li> I was really skeptic of this at first because its a spunge and there are so many reviews and youtube tutorials about it. I thought it was a gimic, but now that I&#x27;ve used it its so much better than using brushes. my makeup was absolutely flawless.</li>
    <li> Love Luv Love! This product provides that dewy, non cakey look I was after. Blends makeup very well and a must have.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for my foundation application. It puts just the right amount on without soaking up all the product. If I use a brush it makes it too thick so I think i will be sticking to these from now on!</li>
    <li> From the first time I used a beauty blender, I was hooked!  The shape and more importantly, the firmness (or lack thereof) makes this the perfect sponge applicator.  I tried other egg-shaped ones from CVS but they were hard and non-pliable, nor would they absorb any product.  The beauty blender absorbs the product enough to hold it and redistribute it on your face.  The pointy end does, in fact, get into any nook and cranny, especially around the eyes and nose.  The bulbous end is good for blending.  I freaking love these sponges but hate that they&#x27;re so expensive!! I miss the days of spending $2 for 40 wedge sponges, albeit they were not as good of quality as these are.</li>
    <li> i used it once and I can not judge it well, but I felt shade of debut</li>
    <li> Nothing makes applying makeup any easier than the beauty blender and the price is amazing for TWO! This leaves a flawless and airbrushed looking face. Definitely worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even remember how I managed to apply foundation before purchasing these beautyblenders. AWESOME.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes it easy to put on makeup and blend it.</li>
    <li> These are the best make-up sponges you will ever use!  They are worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Great sponge for applying makeup.  I&#x27;ve used mine for about two years now and have had no issues with it at all.  Perfect for blending in foundation, etc.</li>
    <li> Amazing, especially if you have a dry face or patches it makes it look smooth and airbrushed! Also doesn&#x27;t look cakey or too much makeup is on the face.</li>
    <li> I revived the item on time but when I open the box I found alot of human hair was every where outside the box but inside was clean, its look they have store it in dirty place.</li>
    <li> I have been using the sponge for awhile and it&#x27;s been good so far. It&#x27;s a great buy won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> The beautyblender makepup products are perfect. I recommend it to everyone. I bought this sponges and It is really different than other brands.</li>
    <li> This is really hard to rate but one thing is guarantied it blends nicely</li>
    <li> This is such a good deal you get to beauty blender for the price of one! There&#x27;s not a better way to buy these and less someone&#x27;s buying them for you as a gift! I love these it&#x27;s so easy to achieve flawless skin when using one of these, also it&#x27;s also nice against your skin like a little facial massage as you start off your day!</li>
    <li> Best deal! I got two for the price of one and they work great! I love using one for foundation and one for concealer. They are easy to clean and perfect for blending out liquid makeup. It leaves a flawless application. I use these everyday.</li>
    <li> I held out on buying an original beauty blender for a while, but now, I&#x27;m never going back to the imitation blenders. This makes my foundation look flawless and it feels so soft!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE! This is my second time purchasing the pack. They are awesome and they work so well. They give you a really finished look. I don&#x27;t apply foundation or anything without these.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. Love the even, natural finish when used.</li>
    <li> I used this sponge for over a year. It really gives you great even coverage. The biggest drawback to using it is that you have to use and apply  a lot more of your foundation than you would if you used your fingers or makeup brush. I went back to my makeup brush and/or using my ring finger to apply my foundation. (Your weakest finger is your ring finger as it applies the least pressure to your skin. You don&#x27;t want to stretch your skin around the eye area anymore than you need to) For the money, clean up time etc. I find that the standard techniques are the best.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last as long I expected after the second wash, it had little rips.. I think I received fake sponges.</li>
    <li> Good price, arrived in perfect condition. No complaints. Was what i expected to receive</li>
    <li> This is the best possible deal on these sponges. They&#x27;re soft and supple and once dampened and completely squeezed out of water (I sometimes put them into a dry washcloth and then squeeze) they create a wonderful finish when you pounce foundation onto the skin.</li>
    <li> I love this thing and for the price im definitely ordering again!! it does claim what everybody says about the beauty blender in love with it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t want to spend this much money on a sponge but I did and I LOVE IT.... makes me look dewy but not greasy... it can sometimes look cakey in spots but just blend more and it will go away...LOVE THIS SPONGE...I GOT 2 AND I AM GLAD I DID :)</li>
    <li> I was so pleasantly surprised when I found this on Amazon. I&#x27;ve been looking to buy these sponges, but didn&#x27;t want to shell out $20 for just one.&lt;br /&gt;this product applies foundation beautifully and leaves a flawless finish.&lt;br /&gt;I love this so much, i may have to stop using my Sigma flat top kabuki to apply my foundation.</li>
    <li> I can not live without these! Use them on myself and my clients. The absolute best tool. If taken care of, they last quite a while and the package for two is such a great deal. LOVE MY BEAUTY BLENDERS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps i have bought the dupes and they don&#x27;t work half as good as the original in my opinion!</li>
    <li> ok, this is the best thing for applying foundation! I cant´t believe I waited so long to get mine! but I&#x27;m glad I did, it´s totally worth the money!...very recommended</li>
    <li> I ordered this product in June,  when I received it and used it,  it fell apart,  I contacted the seller and 2 more was sent to me. .. Again. .. It fell apart. .. :(</li>
    <li> I hesitated on purchasing this because truthfully I do not wear makeup everyday and I wasn&#x27;t sure that it was worth it. I have had it in my wishlist for nearly a year now, and always hesitating on purchasing it. I am so happy that I did purchase it. I use this with my Skin 79 BB cream and it makes my face absolutely flawless. I have combo-skin (dry in some parts and oily in others) and was afraid that the brush might not blend in and make things look cakey but I was wrong. I am very glad I purchased this! Totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> Good value for two pack.... anyone who has seen the bazillions of obsessed youtubers knows these things are pretty awesome. Are they worth the price vs the dupe? Well depends on what you want and if you have the extra money to spend. They&#x27;re softer &amp; squishier than it&#x27;s cheaper counterpart, but it does the same job IMO.</li>
    <li> Great product for applying your liquid make-up. I&#x27;ll never use a brush again.</li>
    <li> The hype is all true.  This is an amazing product and Amazon has the best price.  I use it for concealing and blending my makeup, and it leaves my skin looking flawless!  No other blender works like this.  Now, I just need to purchase the cleanser.</li>
    <li> These are great for applying foundation! Everyone should have these - if you want your make - up to look great.  Watch tutorials on youtube.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Good price her on amaozn</li>
    <li> Great product- the same thing as you get in the stores, but cheaper on Amazon</li>
    <li> Makeup blends to a natural finish. LOVE this product.</li>
    <li> Love my beauty blender, my daughter wanted one as well. So a 2 pack that shopped quickly worked out well.</li>
    <li> FAKE!!!!!!!!!!!! DONT BUY THIS! I HAVE HAD TONS OF BEAUTY BLENDERS AND THIS IS COMPLETELY FAKE! Waist of money, thats what I get for trying to save a few bucks.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it. The market has others now that are a little bit more affordable.</li>
    <li> I have purchased the Beautyblender from Sephora previously but didn&#x27;t want to spend $20 for another sponge so I thought I&#x27;d save some money buy purchasing it off Amazon. THESE ARE NOT REAL BEAUTYBLENDERS. They are significantly smaller and do not have the same &#x27;bouncy&#x27; texture as the real sponges. They also have a weird smell to them. If you were planning on buying a sponge, I would do it directly from Sephora so you know you&#x27;re getting the real thing.</li>
    <li> It is amazing, totally worth the money! When you use the beauty blender it gives you a really nice flawless look and it blends it in perfectly. Make sure when using it that you wet it and squeez out all the water. It is best used that way, because since it is a sponge it will soack up anything wet, and if you dont wet it, the beauty blender will just soak up all the foundation into the sponge and none on your face. There are also certain types of foundation that are not recommended for the beauty blender. I would not recommend using whipped foundation because it is too thick and you will not be able to properly blend in some places. All in all, the beauty blender has been the best way to blend in my foundation very nicely, and it never leaves harsh lines.</li>
    <li> really cheap for the product. And it&#x27;s the real thing! I was so happy to spot this online; other retailers tend to sell these at $15-19 a pop. So two for $21 was just incredible.</li>
    <li> These are absolutely necessary for a flawless liquid makeup application. With continual use, they do wear out quickly. Kinda pricey for something that needs to be continually replaced. The sister Beautyblender Solid Blendercleanser 1 oz product helps with longevity and is a wonderful multi make-up tool cleanser. Probably the better buy of the two products.</li>
    <li> I like this for heavier foundations. It blends it seamlessly with the skin and makes it not go on as thick. For lighter not as heavy products it doesn&#x27;t work as well and you get almost no coverage. So it works with only some products.</li>
    <li> Very good product. My girl loves this. At sephora u get 1 for $15.</li>
    <li> What can i say!  It is truly perfection!&lt;br /&gt;Such a great tool to apply foundation to your clients!&lt;br /&gt;Leaves the skin flawless!</li>
    <li> I got these after reading reviews and they are so amazing that I cant stop using them. I love how easy they are to clean as well. I reccomend the cleaning product for these ebcayse using antibactieral soap like I do makes  the pink come out of these</li>
    <li> This beauty blender is something I originally found very expensive for its purpose. I still took my chance to try it because I&#x27;ve always been fond of making myself presentable. When I first tried it though, I realized it was a really great product. It blended my primer and foundation all too well...my face looked like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still find it very expensive for a freaking sponge though. Oh well.</li>
    <li> Much smaller than I expected. Don&#x27;t really see a difference in my application. It&#x27;s okay</li>
    <li> These get rave reviews. I like it. But it wastes too much makeup and streaks up my face a little too much for my liking. It is good if you&#x27;ve got a blemish, it certainly helps to buff the foundation. But, I bought these once, and didn&#x27;t again. I wouldn&#x27;t discourage anyone from trying it, just not my style.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product; there is no duping this awesome tool, and I consider it essential for my make-up application since I use a heavy liquid foundation. Just make sure to keep it well stored in a clean, dry place and to keep it clean! This is by far the best bargain I&#x27;ve found, also.</li>
    <li> Although as a makeup artist, I have been used to using some of the best products on the market, I am also a skeptic when it comes to shelling out high amounts of money to buy the latest thing that is causing a huge stir.  I tend to sit back and wait before jumping on the band wagon for most things when it comes to beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things I avoided was buying the Beauty Blender.  I had makeup sponges, brushes, and many other methods of application down under my belt, so I did not feel that I needed to pay such a high price for such a small item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I had a chance to try out a set of two Beauty Blenders, and was surprised to find that if I had been told several things about them to begin with, I would have purchased one sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW TO USE A BEAUTY BLENDER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-First of all, a Beauty Blender is not a conventional makeup sponge. When you put it in water, it swells up a lot bigger than it is when dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Once it is wet, you squeeze out the water and then make sure that the sponge is damp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-With the damp sponge, you carefully tap the side of the sponge that you want to use (broad for large spots and narrow for narrow areas) and you bounce the sponge off of your skin quickly and making sure that you cover a lot of area before reloading the sponge, you cover your face with makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-IT WILL OFTEN LOOK LIKE YOU ARE NOT APPLYING ENOUGH- resist the temptation to apply too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-With the tip of the sponge, blend the areas around the nose and inner eye, etc, well but lightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also use this for cream blush and cream eyeshadow if you like(using the tip), but remember, you have to wash the sponge in between or you will get muddy makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLEANING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have a special cleanser you can buy that is made for the sponge, but I use Dr Bronner&#x27;s Castile soap diluted down or non sodium lauryl sulfate cleansers that are gentle (Avalon hand soap is one example) so that it won&#x27;t deteriorate the sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;Gives airbrush finish&lt;br /&gt;Makes cream makeup products not dry out as quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pink color will wash out for a while and look scary, but it is fine&lt;br /&gt;EXPENSIVE&lt;br /&gt;Can stain with some products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT THIS IS NOT GOOD FOR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sponge is not particularly suitable for&lt;br /&gt;Powder products&lt;br /&gt;Blush that is not cream&lt;br /&gt;Lip products&lt;br /&gt;Skin Cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINAL COMMENTS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all the Beauty Blender is one of the most important tools that I have in my kit for cream foundations and blush.  I use it for doing foundation on men as well as women, and when using the right products, they are virtually undetectable when using the Beauty Blender as the application tool.  When using brushes or conventional cosmetic sponges, the results took more effort.  It is worth the money if you use these on a regular basis or if you have special occasions you want to look just right for.that it won&#x27;t deteriorate the sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;Gives airbrush finish&lt;br /&gt;Makes cream makeup products not dry out as quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pink color will wash out for a while and look scary, but it is fine&lt;br /&gt;EXPENSIVE&lt;br /&gt;Can stain with some products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT THIS IS NOT GOOD FOR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sponge is not particularly suitable for&lt;br /&gt;Powder products&lt;br /&gt;Blush that is not cream&lt;br /&gt;Lip products&lt;br /&gt;Skin Cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINAL COMMENTS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all the Beauty Blender is one of the most important tools that I have in my kit for cream foundations and blush.

    <li> I read everywhere about how great and how special these make-up sponges were.  Finally convinced to cough up the dough (they&#x27;re not cheap!), I was shocked to find that everyone was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How in the heck do these things work?  What are they made of?  Can I find the same stuff at Home Depot and just cut it up?  Will the price ever drop?  So far, not yet, but I won&#x27;t use anything else..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find they last longer if I keep them clean by gently washing them/squeezing them in gentle soap and water</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been experimenting with different products such as sigma brushes and real technique brushes, which I do love.  The blender is lovely too because with the dampness of the sponge a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I find this really easy to use on a daily basis. Wetting it really helps moisturize the face and allows products to glide on smoothly. Very easy to clean as well!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve rarely used a makeup sponge in the past.. I&#x27;ve always used my fingers to apply my liquid foundation. I kept reading about how much everyone loves the beauty blender though, and I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. It does help my foundation sink into my skin instead of just laying on my face like a mask as before. My coverage of blemishes and dark spots are better overall, and my makeup looks more natural. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The beauty blenders are the best thing to blend you makeup correctly! Everything from concealer, liquid foundation and even your powder!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard about the Beauty Blenders non stop for the past year. I avoided purchasing them because, well, I like makeup but I&#x27;m cheap. I have tried the cheap knockoffs for like $3 each and hated them. I got these for Christmas and WOW. LOVE LOVE LOVE. I really didn&#x27;t expect them to work as well as they do. If you&#x27;re on the fence about these, get them. Don&#x27;t even try the cheap ones. Not the same at all.</li>
    <li> I have been watching a few youtube blogs by professional makeup artists, and because SO many have mentioned this product, I had to give it a try.  I was very hesitant about purchasing a beauty sponge that was this expensive, but I finally gave in.  These sponges work beautifully, especially if you are using high quality makeup.  I use this to blend my foundation and concealer, and it does a beautiful job.  It takes about 2 minutes of effortless \\&quot;dabbing\\&quot; of the damp sponge over your face, and then all of a sudden, your redness is gone, and it looks like you aren&#x27;t wearing any makeup.  I think the magic behind this sponge is the fact that it&#x27;s round, and the sponge material is very high quality; it feels like it&#x27;s made of the same fiber material that earplugs are made out of (just an observation).  It makes perfectly applied foundation completely effortless.  I cannot achieve the same dewey finish with a brush or with my fingers; it just isn&#x27;t possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash this sponge every or every other day and it&#x27;s holding up well.  I have a small spray bottle of water and I spray the sponge a few times and then squeeze out the excess (this is a lot faster than putting it in water and waiting for 5 minutes for the water to absorb).  My one word of advice is to not use a lot of pressure while you are using it; you really don&#x27;t need to, and the coverage is more natural if you don&#x27;t :)</li>
    <li> I finally bit the dust and purchased 3 BeautyBlenders. I love bouncing this soft sponge against my skin to apply either my liquid or powder foundation.  The results &#x3D; almost an air-brushed, dewy look &#x3D; LOVE IT!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like is that for this price, the BB (and I&#x27;ve purchased not just from here, but other vendors not on Amazon) is that after about 4 uses, the sponge starts showing tiny little tears (and yes, I wash w/ a gentle cleanser and no, I don&#x27;t have long fingernails).  Also, my sponge continued to shed pink color during the 1st 5 or so washings.  Finally, it is permanently discolored from my foundation (and was from the 1st use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of interest is that I have found once I have used the BB, it never goes back to its original size - it will remain slightly bigger than its original size.  I love watching it \\&quot;grow\\&quot; when I place it in water.  I then gently squeeze all the excess water out and squeeze again w/ it wrapped in a washcloth (which I rotate every few days)prior to applying my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what&#x27;s up w/ the crappy construction, but for the results I get,I will continue to use and re-purchase as necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;08/31/13 UPDATE - I have bumped up to 5 stars.  After the initial tiny tears mentioned above, the sponge stopped disintegrating - kinda weird.  I used one from 02/12 until yesterday successfully (with regular cleaning of course - dove soap or Dr. Bronner&#x27;s - i have a wonderful DIY MU brush/sponge cleaner recipe if interested).  Anyway, my sponge was FINALLY reaching the end of its life (after 18 months, I&#x27;d say that is a FANTASTIC investment!  I actually gave away my other unused ones when I realized this one was going to last and last.  I finally, just re-purchased.  My seller was Amazon and these are the real deal, not some elaborate knock-off.  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Got these for my daughter and she loved the product.</li>
    <li> Not sure what all the hype is about this sponge.  Gave it a try and didn&#x27;t really notice a difference from anything else that I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s sort of a pain to clean after each use and hard to navigate around smaller areas like the side of the nose.  Used it for a bit and then went back to my disposable sponges.</li>
    <li> Love this product! You could use it for your foundation &amp; concealer and the application goes on smooth.</li>
    <li> waaaaaaaaaaw  thank you I like it so much</li>
    <li> Great deal. Authentic.</li>
    <li> Perfect application and gives me a dewy looking finish</li>
    <li> Outstanding product. Blends makeup like nothing else. I am very pleased with this product</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical when purchasing this product but after reading the reviews, decided it was worth the try. I&#x27;ve used it for 2 weeks now and can&#x27;t rave enough about it! It has done wonders for my foundation routine. I was using a MAC foundation brush, but I haven&#x27;t touched it since I purchased this. I used a very thick, long wear foundation. This sponge was easy to use and does in fact give me an air brushed look. It does NOT soak up foundation like most sponges and blends product perfectly. I&#x27;ve tested it out with drugstore and department store foundations and have gotten the same results. Both look flawless. No cake-yness at all.</li>
    <li> Amazing great for makeup. They are worth the price. Last quite a long time.</li>
    <li> love it!! Goes on smooth, results look fabulous. I have been wanting one for a while, but didn&#x27;t want to pay the 19.95 for one at the store. Its a must have for smooth results!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t like these.  The Beautyblenders applied my foundation well, but no better than the disposable round sponges I usually get.  My main problem with the Beautyblenders was that I never really could get them clean (and they quickly became stained with foundation, which adds to the impression that they&#x27;re not getting clean).  And I&#x27;d go to use them the next morning and they&#x27;d still be a little damp - I worried bacteria was in them.  Since I&#x27;m prone to acne and I have to be careful what comes into contact with my face, I&#x27;ve gone back to using disposable sponges.  Also, I didn&#x27;t care for whatever pink dye they used in these... it bled out of the Beautyblender every time I washed it.</li>
    <li> This is a price you cant beat. I believe that if you are looking for quality and quantity this is a great buy. Blends well and is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Love these! Follow directions and be sure to wet it prior to liquid foundation application. Amazing. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I know this sponges are on the pricey side but it does apply the foundation very nicely with out looking cakey. I apply my foundation thin layers at a time until I found my desired coverage. then I blend my concealer with this too and use it to set with a powder. I will not be needing to pack many makeup brushes on our up coming trip to Canada in a few days.&lt;br /&gt;I use baby shampoo to clean this and it works very well instead of paying extra for the cleanser.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my beauty blender for several weeks and I absolutely love it.  The finish is far superior to that of a brush with the foundations that I use; although, I still feel its a little pricey for a sponge.  Prior to using this, I&#x27;d been using the soho makeup sponge and really liked it.  It&#x27;s 1/4 of the price of a single beauty blender and really is a great makeup sponge.  Is the beauty blender better? Yes, but when you factor in the price, I think the soho sponge gives it some competition.  Others may disagree, but I&#x27;m not the type to regularly blow loads of money on makeup and I don&#x27;t wear foundation everyday.  True makeup-aholics will probably say there&#x27;s no comparison.  there is a definite difference in the texture and firmness of the sponge with the bb being the softer of the two.  It&#x27;s like the little holes in the sponge are much smaller on the bb; they&#x27;re like micro holes.  The soho sponge is soft, but firmer when compared to the bb.  The soho sponge seems more prone to tears when cleaning too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re worried about spending too much money, I say go with the soho sponge as you can get it for around five at Walmart.  I don&#x27;t regret my purchase especially since amazon had the best price for the two pack  Getting just one at full price is just not worth it to me.  I probably will purchase the bb again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use kiss my face peace soap to clean it.  I also use more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; foundations (lavera, Josie Maran, tarte) and they all apply very well with both my soho sponge and the bb.  the lavera is my absolute favorite as it&#x27;s all natural and the bb makes it look completely flawless on my skin.  I do need to work quickly though since it sets so fast.  It&#x27;s sort of a testament to how good the bb is when most people say that Lavera needs to be applied with your fingertips since its doesn&#x27;t contain any silicones...the bb makes it look so much better on my skin than when applying with my hands.  My only complaint is that it&#x27;s such a pain to have to clean it after every use.</li>
    <li> It is the best sponge i&#x27;ve ever used. It Blends perfectly.This is truly a blending sponge, it promotes an almost flawless coverage.</li>
    <li> I love my Beauty Blenders! They changed the way I apply my foundation and they are an indispensable beauty tool. They are worth every penny and as long as they are properly cleaned after every use and sanitized, now and again they last a long time and are clean and healthy for the skin. I will keep buying Beauty Blenders as long as they continue to make them.</li>
    <li> Amazing product soo much better then applying make up  your hands.</li>
    <li> The blender is alright, though difficult to clean.</li>
    <li> Great addition to my make up kit. The price is great and they last a long time!</li>
    <li> Love love love my Beautyblender. It definitely works at its best when it is damp. I soak mine under the faucet, squeeze out the excess water, and it is usually good to go. Used dry it usually leaves my foundation looking kind of splotchy.</li>
    <li> Great product for applying my foundation or bb cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used my fingers or a foundation brush to apply my foundation. but after viewing makeup tutorials for the \\&quot;flawless\\&quot; look, I realized I either need to buy a stipple brush or this sponge. I did my research and went ahead and gave this a go. I am SO glad that I did, my makeup look more even and flawless than ever! My face gets very red when I used to apply my foundation, I love that you just dab foundation on with the beautyblender. I also love the fact that you soak the sponge in water before applying, my skin looks moisturized and dewy. How I mentioned I love the beautyblender??</li>
    <li> The beautyblender i received, i&#x27;ve go to said it&#x27;s worth every dollars i spent, i love it even i didn&#x27;t use the foundation that much i still can say that it gives you the flawless finished but by the way don&#x27;t used it with an expensive liquid foundations because it&#x27;s absorb the product quite more than you use to used but, oh well :) amazon gives you the very good deal with this sponge !</li>
    <li> You can blend it all with the beauty blender. I like the way you can build up your foundation with this sponge and still manage to not look cakey. It&#x27;s easy to clean. It&#x27;s just a great sponge.</li>
    <li> I think I got a great deal for 2x sponges. They work as expected and I&#x27;m very pleased. Highly recommend it. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I love how fast this sponge applies my foundation. Just wet it and squeeze out the excess water, dab on your foundation, it takes less than a minute and is much faster than using a brush!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used make up sponges for years, but the last few years they all tend to have a rubbery finish that just smears the makeup around. I&#x27;ve had to cut off the outside to get to the spongey part of them at times. I did not know if I&#x27;d like these, but was getting desperate. Every time I find a type of sponge that I like, then they discontinued it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These sponges are great. I read a review on them that suggested putting the makeup on my face w/ my fingers first, then using these to &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; it. I did not really want to go there, but decided to give it a shot. It worked great and I continue to apply it in this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use face wash to clean these  - the foaming face wash works best - and I wash them out about every 4-5 uses (I work my way around the sponge each time)..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> This was a gift my daughter had requested for 2012 Christmas.  She loves them and is still using them.</li>
    <li> Fake beauty blender. It&#x27;s a stiff rubber feeling sponge not soft and and silky feeling like the real beauty blender. It was too good to be true for this price. The only thing Authentic about this product is the package. There isn&#x27;t any booklet like the real beauty blender has. If you are looking for the real deal then purchase from an authorized seller like sephora or beauty blender itself.</li>
    <li> i think i got some fake ones. not happy at all.... The product works, i guess...., i will have to see if it doesnt brake me out, or if its durable,,,</li>
    <li> I suspected these were fake when I bought them from this amazon seller months ago (as I had bought previous Beauty Blenders direct from the company and these felt different). Over the Thanksgiving holiday I bought two from the Sephora store and my suspicions were confirmed.  How I know the ones i bought from this amazon seller are fake: the texture, the length of time they last (one or two months whereas the real ones I had bought previously lasted 6 months each. These fakes actually broke on me which the real ones did not do), the fact that they don&#x27;t stand up at the base the way real ones do, the fact that they don&#x27;t expand as much as the real ones do. Buyers beware.  I have photographic evidence and kept a fake as well. So I can back up my claims</li>
    <li> My daughter and I split a set and we both love have smoothly everything can be applied. I prefer spraying a little water on the sponge before application.</li>
    <li> This was my first time buying the Beauty Blender. I thought it was all hype and wondered if the ratings were accurate. I am very pleased with it. It works very well. It blends well so your makeup looks natural.</li>
    <li> Save yourself time and go to the dollar store, buy a bag of sponges and cut them down; like I did after I got these.</li>
    <li> this is amazing, I love the way it applies my liquid foundation...flawless , great product...it can be somewhat hard to clean all of the foundation off from it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try the beauty blender but was afraid that it wasn&#x27;t worth the hype. I used the sonia kashuk sponge (from Target) for a while and it worked pretty well until I decided to try BB. There is NO comparison! I definitely recommend these sponges if you are looking for a flawless application with your foundation. Also, I suggest buying the two-pack because it&#x27;s a better deal.</li>
    <li> Brand New Item, just like in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;I love using it for the foundation.&lt;br /&gt;It gives great natural look.&lt;br /&gt;I just love the feeling of it after soak into water :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like that this sponge bleeds pink. I rinsed it with soap for 10 minutes and it still bled pink. My fingers work as well as this sponge.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything to apply foundation. I love Beauty Blenders but they are expensive so I tried other options.  I got an expensive professional brush, and even the Sephora sponge but I ended up returning everything. There is nothing like the Beauty Blender.  I wet it before applying my foundation so I doesn&#x27;t go on as thick. There are no brush marks or blotchy spots because it covers so much area at once. I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to another application method.  No matter how much they charge for the Beauty Blender i will continue to buy it!</li>
    <li> I loved that this one comes in a two pack, it&#x27;s cheaper than the Sephora website because I used my prime account and shipping was free. It applies the foundation easily and evenly. It also saves me time to apply key makeup.  I truly love love love this sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste money on brushes this is the best</li>
    <li> i love beauty blenders and for the price, i was so happy. these work wonders for foundation application. i will repurchase,</li>
    <li> I love the way the beauty blender leaves your skin looking flawless. I honestly feel thus sponge is an essential. Shipping was fast!</li>
    <li> I love that this applicator is easy to use and makes my makeup look great, not a huge fan of cleaning it though.</li>
    <li> I still ended up using more foundation than I would using the blender than when I use my foundation brush, and that&#x27;s with using a primer as well. I did like the way it blended, almost flawless but if you naturally have a good hand at applying makeup then I suppose you could achieve that with any tool. The blender also does soak up way less product than your average makeup sponge does, but it&#x27;s still a sponge and it still soaks up. I guess I was just expecting a miracle of sorts since most magazines and celeb makeup artists swear by it but there&#x27;s still improvements to be made. Overall, I think it&#x27;s a bit over priced for what it&#x27;s worth. I&#x27;ll continue to use the one I have until it inusable anymore but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be rushing to purchase another one anytime soon. I&#x27;ll start looking for a good quality foundation brush for now.</li>
    <li> This sponge is the one of the best beauty tools I have ever purchased! I had been using the MAC 187 brush prior to the beauty blender and was not thrilled with the results--the foundation just looked too heavy. Mind you, I use a medium to heavy coverage all-day wear foundation. After watching a demo on YouTube, I took my first shot at it and was AMAZED at how airbrushed and perfect my foundation looked! the MAC brush has since been gathering dust. I have actually bought a couple more beauty blenders so I can rotate them and not have to wash one every day. Just wet it squeeze the extra water out, dot on your foundation throughout your face and tap the sponge around to blend. Use the pointy tip for areas around your nose and eyes. The whole process only takes 2 minutes tops, yet your foundation will look professionally applied. Don&#x27;t think twice about it--buy it now if you&#x27;re wanting that perfect airbrushed foundation look.</li>
    <li> Love my beauty blender!!!</li>
    <li> I was kind of skeptical about the beauty blender, but I saw a lot of hype about it on YouTube &amp; I&#x27;ve got to say I do not regret it! It blends beautifully &amp; gives me the natural face look without leaving my makeup cakey which I love! I have adopted it into my routine and sometimes use it with my foundation..i do use it everyday for my under eye concealer &amp; it&#x27;s working great for me!</li>
    <li> This has transformed my make up in to a flawless finish.  It is a must have for me now.  I have purchased for several friends after they commented on how nice and smooth my make up looked.  They love it as well.  The only down side is that I use up a bottle of make up a little faster because the sponge kind of absorbs more make up than a brush or regular make up sponge.  Its totally worth it though!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to receive the Beauty Blender and had no problem shelling out $20 for what was touted as being the HG of makeup application. While a very good sponge, and it does apply makeup nicely, it&#x27;s definitely overpriced and way overhyped.  I have had mine for about a month and it already has a rips and tears. Worse, it&#x27;s impossible to clean unless you buy their BeautyBlender brand cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m reluctantly giving this 4 stars because the product itself does apply makeup beautifully, but so does my $34 Sephora foundation brush and that will last me two to three years, not two months.</li>
    <li> I have purchased thousands of dollars in make up and tools (brushes, sponges,etc.) and have almost always found the downside to every product. I usually buy my wedge sponges at Merle Norman which is pretty pricey. I have ditched my wedge sponges entirely after receiving these! Rarely, I do come across a product that is simply AMAZING. This is one of those products. The sponges were delivered in the time frame provided and I couldn&#x27;t wait to apply my make up when I got them as I had read all of the reviews and KNEW this was going to be incredible. I also watch a lot of You Tube videos by Wayne Goss who is a magician when it comes to make up. You can find him under the handle gossmakeupartist. Anyhow,these sponges are a miracle. They blend better than anything I have EVER used and they are very well made. If you follow the instructions provided, you will have a flawless face, even if you have little or no experience with make up application. The tapered end is perfect for under they eyes and around the nose and the bulbous end is perfect for blending on the rest of your face. You cannot go wrong, it is foolproof! I was a little wary about spending so much on sponges but after reading all the reviews figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong and I was right! I have told so many people about these sponges because not only have they made my beauty routine easier, my face looks amazing! I haven&#x27;t even had to use the 2nd sponge yet so when the first one bites the dust, I already have my back up ready and waiting. They are super easy to clean and feel great on your face when using them! If you don&#x27;t buy these, you&#x27;re missing out!</li>
    <li> I have a few high-end foundation brushes, and I will admit - the beautyblender sponge applies the makeup just as evenly as those expensive brushes, if not better.  it doesn&#x27;t streak and blends very, very well.  it also feels great against my skin.  it isn&#x27;t scratchy like brushes can be.  BUT, these sponges still have the same problem that EVERY sponge inherently has - it WASTES make-up.  sponges soak up so much of your make-up product that unless you have enough money where you seriously just don&#x27;t care about moving through liquid make-up at lightning speeds, then I would stick with a nice brush.  I personally even prefer my fingers to sponges.  I don&#x27;t like wasting make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s DEFINITELY better than regular sponges and really applies so well, it&#x27;s just unfortunate that it&#x27;s a make-up eater.</li>
    <li> I had one of these and my little one decided it looked yummy so she but the top off .  I decided to cheap out and just buy the store brand one, but as you can see by this review I came back to these little beauties.  These are soft and oh so delightful to blend out the perfect foundation.  I will not cheap out again even if my kids decide to destroy these ( no seriously they are on a high shelf now).</li>
    <li> I love this product! Best thing to use to apply makeup it goes on flawless. Love that it is hot pink.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this.  It really helps smooth out makeup &amp; is great for the hard to reach place (corners of eyes &amp; nose).  Blends out makeup &amp; concealer well.  I keep the case &amp; store it in the case with a hole cut out for air so it dries.  I keep the other new one in a baggie until I&#x27;m ready to swap out.  This will always be in my beauty arsenal.  Just be sure to give it a good cleaning after every use.</li>
    <li> Best thing since to vented since the wheel !!!!! Love love love this and am about to buy more !!! So worth the price it is !!!!</li>
    <li> Love! Can&#x27;t live without now. My friend bought the generic version and was not a fan... I gave her one of these and she said it&#x27;s completely different &amp; she now uses everyday!</li>
    <li> HOLY CRAP!! THIS BEAUTY BLENDER IS MY HOLY GRAIL WHEN IT COMES TO BLENDING IN MY FOUNDATION! I STILL USE MY BRUSHES TO BRUSH ON FOUNDATION...BUT FINISH IT WITH THE BEAUTY BLENDER!! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This thing is wonderful and lasts forever. I have yet to find another blender like this one. Top quality. I will buy and recommend again.</li>
    <li> a tool I can&#x27;t live without , now that I&#x27;ve had one and use it every day .It works for applying  bb cream VERY well.</li>
    <li> I recommend this beauty product to anyone who wants a flawless finish from their foundation. Easy to use and clean. Will instantly become a staple in your make-up routine. Love it!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when first buying this but I love it.  It is cheaper on here than buying it at Sephora or elsewhere and works wonderfully.  Its soft and easy to use and makeup application is so natural looking.  Definitely pleased :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE the beauty blender.  The application is so much more flawless than any brush could ever achieve.  I am most likely a lifetime user of this product!</li>
    <li> This works really well for blending makeup.  I do use it to apply foundation sometimes and get a nice even dewy look.  Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I love my beauty blender for blending out my concealer!  I know a lot of people love it for blending out their foundation but I find it too small and time consuming for foundation application.</li>
    <li> Beautiful finish. Easy to use and easy to clean. I use the pointed end for under eye and around the nose and the rounded end for the rest of the face. Watch YouTube videos of Gossmakeupartist for lots of useful lessons on use of this product as well.</li>
    <li> Ok this sponge is just perrrrfect. i cannot even describe how wonderful it works because it just does the job so amazing. Anyone who cannot get the foundation on smoothly and easily with this sponge just doesnt know a thing about applying makeup or using horrid makeup to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must have makeup sponge. must have!</li>
    <li> These are the most amazing things ever.  I used to use #187 Mac brush.  I will never use another application for putting on foundation.  Wish I would have know about these a long time ago.  Flawless!</li>
    <li> Nothing special.  I like my Ulta wedges better!  I don&#x27;t know why so much hype over this!  Would not recommend, save your money.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this but haven&#x27;t used it as much as I thought.  Works well to blend makeup but I think I prefer a good makeup brush instead.</li>
    <li> Beauty blender sponges are the best! I won&#x27;t buy any other brand. They sell them at Sephora however if you are lucky you can get 2 for $20 at Amazon. That is a bargain!</li>
    <li> I have been using this sponge for 3 months now and I love it. The only down side is that when I dip it into the water and I wring it, my nails go into the sponge and make holes. So if you have long nails, be careful with your nails or wear gloves.</li>
    <li> Pros: Soft and blends smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how these beauty blenders apply foundation on.  It gives me a natural coverage and it blends evenly.  I am happy that I gave these a try.</li>
    <li> Works well and gives me a nice even natural look.  My makeup doesn&#x27;t look Casey.  The pink only washes  off a little when washing because the makeup ingredients take it off .  But if I just wash it by itself it is fine.</li>
    <li> I really love this sponge. I&#x27;ve used a stippling brush, foundation brush and other sponges and by far this is my favorite way to apply my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have with it, is the cleaning. It stains easily and if you don&#x27;t use the right soap you&#x27;ll have a hard time cleaning it.  I found that hotel bar soaps work the best even though some stains just won&#x27;t go away.&lt;br /&gt;I have had mine for about a year and a half and it is just now starting to fall apart, not bad for a sponge I use every day!</li>
    <li> I freakin love this product. I use liquid make up and actually it&#x27;s maybeline Foundation that&#x27;s 6 or 7 dollars and I usually use my mac studio tech but this sponge makes my foundation looks so smooth and natural and make my 7 dollar make up look just as flawless as my $30 dollar make up. I Love this product and will never go back to any other blender for my Foundation. And honestly when in a rush I use it to blend everything together my concealer bronzer and foundation and my make up looks so flawless and natural.</li>
    <li> She uses this thing all the time, I got her 2 packs and she orgasms when it touches her face, so that&#x27;s a 5 star.</li>
    <li> Worth ALL the hype.  Will not waste another penny on a knock-off.  I spritz with MAC&#x27;s Fix spray and lightly buff my foundation to a air-brushed finish.  Also like to blend my contouring and highlighting with a dry BeautyBlender.  LOVE!!!</li>
    <li> Thanks to the makeupgeek website, I learned about this amazing little sponge.  My 37 year old skin is super dry, so flaking skin and a cakey look are problems for me.  This sponge helps hide these issues when I apply foundation and blend concealer and blush.  I will buy more of this brand of sponges in the future, but I bet I won&#x27;t have to buy for a long time, as the sponge still looks, smells, feels and performs like new after a month of daily use.</li>
    <li> I got this a few months back and I haven&#x27;t regretted my decision. It is an excellent makeup tool! I use it to apply liquid and powders even blush! It give you a flawless airbrushed look. So far I have used only one of both sponges and its still going steady and it&#x27;s been almost 5 months since I got it. This is a must have!</li>
    <li> LOVE these... this is my 2nd time purchasing these. i purchase them like once a year! amazing products for makeup</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve herad so much about these sponges that I had to get them. They&#x27;re perfect to use with my liquid foundation, I love it!! and it it the real deal!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big make-up wearer but I do wear concealer under my eyes and light foundation. This sponge is AMAZING!!!! It doesn&#x27;t pull or tug on your skin like using your fingers does and it looks smoother then a brush. I love it! Highly recommend! Great price too.</li>
    <li> I had seen women use the beauty blender on Youtube but I wasn&#x27;t able to buy one. I think this is a deal to buy 2 for less than the price of one. It really does apply makeup to a flawless finish. I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to better their makeup application.</li>
    <li> I have seen and heard about this for so long but never wanted to pay the price for a sponge. When I saw this great deal I knew this was my time to finally try it. Where was this my whole life?? This is the most amazing product ever! Makes your makeup feel light and look flawless with an airbrushed look. And this was delivered pretty fast to me as well. I was very pleased and would order again.</li>
    <li> This is the first (egg) makeup sponge I have purchased.  (I purchased a nice one from the local drug store.  It worked great...until I washed it.  It broke in half!  Back it went.)  So far I am really enjoying the BB sponge.  In additional to the stippling technique, I watched a couple of youtubes and saw where one \\&quot;rolled\\&quot; the sponge over her face after she had finished appling her makeup.  This really gives a flawless finish.  I have purchased a couple of less expensive \\&quot;models\\&quot; to try.  I have not received them, as to date.  It will be interesting to see.  Quick delivery.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> the beauty blender lives up to its hype. ive used a brush, triangle sponges, and my fingers. but none compare to the flawless, non-cakey finish that beauty blender gives. soak it in water, squeeze out the excess, pat dry, and it&#x27;s ready to use! it&#x27;s meant for liquid makeup such as foundation, concealer, cream blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a new staple in my makeup collection !!!</li>
    <li> I held off for quite sometime before finally giving in and purchasing the Beautyblender. I watched so many youtube tutorials and reviews which stated that using the beautyblender gives the most flawless and airbrushed finish to your foundation. I was thrilled to try this product and did so the same day I received it. I used with Virtual Matte Foundation from Prescriptives and it went on like a dream!If anyone is on the fence about investing in these pink little wonder sponges, don&#x27;t hesitate! Not only are they fantastic for foundation but the end with the point can also be used for pinpoint concealing around the eyes, mouth and nose. This was one of the best beauty buys of all time!</li>
    <li> I love this. I used to use my finger to do the application. It is very messy. price is very good.</li>
    <li> It is a nice little shape and puts on foundation very nicely. I just feel it&#x27;s a little over priced; only lasted about a month and a half before it sort of shredded, and I don&#x27;t like that you have to buy a special cleaner for it. I didn&#x27;t buy the cleaner, but cleaned it with gentle soap and water. When cleaning it, a bunch of the pink dye would come out, making me skeptical about rubbing that damp sponge all over my face or my clients faces. I most likely will not purchase this sponge again, I do like sponges, but this one just didnt perform any better than much cheaper sponges.</li>
    <li> Why didnt I buy this sooner? I love my BB sponge! I use make up almost daily and I love the way my face looks now when I apply liquid make up with this amazing sponge! I use it wet and it gives me the airbrushed finish I like yet my make up feels so much lighter compared to when I used to apply it with a stippling brush. It does not cake up, stays on my face all day long and doesnt give me any dry spots...LOVE IT! Perfect for touch ups! Yay!</li>
    <li> My sister liked it but thought it would be better.</li>
    <li> I have put my foundation a couple of ways: a regular sponge from the drugstore, my fingers and different types of brushes. While I have found brushes I really liked nothing beats the beauty blender! Not only is it just generally soft it feels really soft on your skin. Although it may soak up a little more makeup than a regular brush would, nothing else makes your foundation look as natural as the beauty blender. The sponge blends foundation seamlessly into your skin. I do think that these sponges are really expensive but I&#x27;ve tried to use other methods for foundation and concealer but I always go back to the beauty blender.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is the real deal or not but compared to whats in the beauty aisle of CVS... all those knock offs do not compare to this. I&#x27;ve had mine for months and use it every day. It is still in great condition. I use a gentle facial cleaner to clean the sponge and it&#x27;s still in like new condition. Not to mention I haven&#x27;t even touched the second sponge!</li>
    <li> I have always put on my liquid makeup with my fingers.  While I was looking at other cosmetic stuff, this came up in my searches, looked at the reviews, and decided I would give it try.  Well, I have to say I am pleasantly surprised.  I feel as though I am not using as much makeup.  My fingers are makeup-less too!  I knew about using sponges in the past, but the white triangle sponge did not seem suitable for the task.  With this rounded sponge (and pointed end), it is easier to blend on the contours of the face.  I am very happy with this purchase and will continue to use in my makeup routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/17/16:  I still agree that these are great sponges, but my quibble is the cost.  I decided to search Amazon and found Real Techniques Miracle Complexion Sponge (2 sponges in each pack), and work just as well and cost less.</li>
    <li> I thought it was silly to spend so much on a sponge, but I had some gift cards and decided why not try it. I&#x27;m glad I did. My foundation has never looked so silky and flawless. I have a lot of acne and scars and I used to cake on foundation. This helped me apply an even and light application of foundation with full coverage. Just dampen with water then dap into foundation. It doesn&#x27;t absorb too much of the product either.I take it everywhere I go. You&#x27;ll never put on foundation with your fingers or a brush after the beautyblender!</li>
    <li> I love the BeautyBlender and this 2 pack is a GREAT deal.  I&#x27;ll never buy locally again.  I&#x27;ve been using one daily for several months now and it&#x27;s still in perfect shape.</li>
    <li> I got these even though i thought they were expensive and im glad i did! My foundation goes on much smoother even with formulas that aren&#x27;t my favorite that i&#x27;m just trying to finish off the bottle of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband even noticed that it made my skin look more even and less cakey and thats a win if ive ever heard one!</li>
    <li> Trying to get the hang of applying with this instead of a brush or fingers.</li>
    <li> wife and daughter swear by this... will be getting more soon.</li>
    <li> Best deal out there!! I can&#x27;t do my make up without this little baby!!!</li>
    <li> didnt like it first coz its absorb lot foundation , but when my friend asked me what fondation ur using its nice i was happy for the result .and i dont think its fake ،</li>
    <li> Will do the trickbut not worth the hype.</li>
    <li> This product can make any foundation look flawless and airbrushed. Worth the price. Once you have them you will not go back to using your fingers or makeup brush.</li>
    <li> Love these beauty blenders!!!!! Works beautifully!!! Gives such a nice finish!&lt;br /&gt;Have to buy the cleaner for them next! Should&#x27;ve done that when I ordered the beauty blender sponges.</li>
    <li> This product gives my foundation an airbrushed look although it may seem a little pricey..remember it&#x27;s two sponges am kinda regretting buying all those different stippling blending brushes...because this little pink sponge works wonders. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Well, after reading reviews comparing the Beauty Blender to the Sonia Kushak makeup blender one that is sold in Target stores, I decided to buy both and compare them myself.  Beauty Blender wins by a long shot.  BB is softer and conforms more to the curves and angles on your face.  BB makes applying your makeup a smooth, very easy process and it feels so pleasant on your face.  BB improves the appearance of how your makeup blends and looks on your face.  They are worth the price.  Now I know why women spend the extra money for these little pink sponges.  They really make a difference.  The Sonia Kushak blender is too hard and does not soften with water.  It just did not improve the whole experience of putting on makeup at all.  It is going back from whence it came, for a refund.</li>
    <li> great product if it wasn&#x27;t for the price I would have rated it 5 stars I am sure there are tons of cheaper that would be just as good.</li>
    <li> I ordered this based on youtube reviews. At first I was skeptical that it was just going to be a weirdly shaped, expensive sponge.  After using it I saw what the huge rave of the makeup gurus were all about.  My makeup looks so blended and smooth when I use the beauty blender and its so easy to contour with it. I love this product and highly recommend it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This tool has replaced all other makeup brushes I own, which is a ridiculous amount. When you wet this small sponge it expands (make sure to squeeze all excess water out before using) and it blends makeup FLAWLESS. I use it for foundation, concelear, highlighter, etc. Don&#x27;t second guess buying this- just do it. You won&#x27;t regret it.  (Ps- clean every couple days by purchasing a daily brush/sponge cleanser or baby soap!)  It has changed the way I apply makeup (much faster) and so much more natural and flawless looking.</li>
    <li> Love these! They don&#x27;t fall apart like the walgreens ones do.</li>
    <li> it is hard to put into words how amazing this beauty blender is. I love it so much and it makes putting on foundation and powder and anything else a dream! better than any brush I&#x27;ve used and it make it super quick and easy to apply makeup.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when i got this in the mail. I had ordered the two sponges so i could save money. They gave me an authentic one and a fake one. I didnt notice until i washed them. The authentic one was clearly easier to wash. I noticed that the knokoff had diffrent texture and was shaped diffrently. I am very disappointed and will no longer purchase any beauty items off of amazon due to the lack of authenticity.</li>
    <li> I love these little things.  They do just what they say they will, and they are very sturdy.  They don&#x27;t come apart like cheap sponges.  They&#x27;re tight, no see-through holes.</li>
    <li> FAKE FAKE FAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am furious. These are fake! Mine didn&#x27;t even come in a box, they came in a small plastic bag. I want a refund ASAP!!! Do not buy they are FAKE!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> These are fake. They came in a plastic DIY bag.. No beauty blender label or anything. Very disappointing. Do not buy. I am not sure how this got so many good reviews.</li>
    <li> These are the best sponges I&#x27;ve ever used.  I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> OMG I love this beauty blender. I have heard so many talk about this amazing product. If you want a flawless finish to your make,if you want a no- hassle apllication process. Then you must have this. Im loving it and I will have to get another set</li>
    <li> Awesome product! a must buy for blending or fixing any makeup. I love using it while putting on foundation or blending in the blush, bronzer or even while contouring the face.</li>
    <li> These sponges are amazing!!!!! I bought these to apply my liquid foundation and it works miracles! I&#x27;ve previously been using makeup brushes and I saw these online and they had rave reviews. I must say, the hype is true. It made my foundation go on so much smoother, no streaks and the finish was amazing.  You soak this pink sponge in water and then squeeze it out. It doubles in size and will be slightly damp for application.  You basically just stipple and roll this over your face and it evenly distributes the foundation and makes an utterly flawless finish. I&#x27;ve been raving about this to my sister.  It worth the price and Amazon had the best price that I could find anywhere. Its worth it.</li>
    <li> The most useful for foundation</li>
    <li> I order this beauty blendor and it was the most usefull product for applying foundation and concealor and it is easy to clean</li>
    <li> I avoided buying these because they are pricey and I like blending foundation with my hands. Yet this is totally worth it for under the eye blending and all over as well. They suck to clean well but they really are worth it.</li>
    <li> Real Beauty Blenders for awesome price. Have BB purchased from Sephora for comparison.</li>
    <li> These are my jam. Just can&#x27;t find a comparable softness for cheaper. Get these!</li>
    <li> you can not have enough of the beauty blenders</li>
    <li> Received in the mail yesterday and used today to find out they were fake. I have bought many beauty blenders in the past and rely on them for everyday application for my foundation. When I opened I thought they were a little larger than what I was used to seeing for brand new BB&#x27;s, then I wet it and it very quickly became much larger than real beauty blenders do. The application was the worst, these are like low quality sponges that disperse water onto your face with your foundation and makes for a messy application. So disappointed. Looks like I will only be purchasing from Sephora from now on.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use and my foundation looks sooo great when I use my beauty blender. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d use it very often but it&#x27;s the best makeup tool that I own by far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people complain that it doesn&#x27;t work and that it&#x27;s hard and doesn&#x27;t evenly apply their makeup, that&#x27;s probably because their using it dry...YOU HAVE TO DAMPEN IT FIRST for best results, just run it under warm water until it gets nice and fluffy and squeeze out any excess water, dot your face with your favorite foundation-DO NOT PUT IT DIRECTLY ON THE SPONGE- and then just lightly bounce it of your face blending in the foundation...that&#x27;s how I find it to work best. ;)</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! MY BEAUTY BLENDERS, i will purchase these again.</li>
    <li> Package arrived on expected delivery date.  Very happy with product, is exactly as described. Opted to buy the set of two Beauty Blender sponges and Im glad I did.  Two sponges will last me for one year (recommended to use one sponge for 6 months then toss). I didnt purchase the cleanser avaliable, I find a bar of soap cleans the sponge very thoroughly and is a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> works well with blending makeup. Its cool how it doubles in size when wet. I love it sooooo much that am ordering more.</li>
    <li> These were a Christmas gift for my daughter this year.  She loves them.  The service from Make Up Geek Store was amazing.  They included a free eye shadow and a hand written Thank You note wishing us a Merry Christmas!!  MUGs for the win!!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter is big on doing research on any beauty type products. after researching we decided to give it a try. it works great blending in those fine lines that I have. I love it and plan on ordering again.</li>
    <li> This is amazing! At first I was a little hesitant because I have so many blemishes to cover up, I didn&#x27;t think it would be full coverage. Boy, was I wrong! I could have gone with not wearing concealer! Plus, it looks so natural! Highly recommend to anyone, definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is a gift to buy for my wife, like very, very easy to use, because the morning rush time rush, saving time makeup</li>
    <li> I AM A THREE MONTH USER and already, I can&#x27;t explain how much I love the beauty blender. There has been so much hype about this product and I see why. This little sponge absorbs on a lot of product and I love this feature because it has allowed me to save product and at the same time evenly distribute it across my face, even with only one pump of my LM Tinted Moisturizer. I bough my LMTM last year October, and until now, I still have a lot left. This sponge will save you money, trust me!</li>
    <li> fake beautybelnder. what a waste of money!</li>
    <li> Definitely the real deal! I just got it today. I&#x27;ve already had knock-off, but none compare to this. I love my knock-offs for concealer, but for all over application, get this! I got the 2-pack for my sister &amp; I for Christmas &amp; I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It is small, but once you wet it, it grows substantially &amp; is so soft &amp; pliable once towel-dried. It didn&#x27;t come in a plastic bag; it came in the real box. I love it so much! &amp; the price! $21 ($29 with Two-Day shipping) for two blenders DEFINITELY beats one for $19.99 at a certain cosmetics store. Repurchasing very soon!</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the thing, I love these spnges. I have been using them forever and teied the imitation ones and there was no comparison. I always buy from beauty blender on amazon so no counterfeit issues. I just received 2 new sponges on 12/6. I care for them well, use baby shampoo, never leave them with makeup on them. One has fallen apart already. The top just crumbled. The last set I had one turned black and moldy within a month. I have no pets, no mice and no mold in my home. I take very good care of the things. I&#x27;m not sure what is going on with BB. Maybe a new manufacturing plant is being used will post pictures and write to seller and hope they honor the product.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I was a little skeptical of buying this at first because I thought that it was an insane price for a sponge. However, I received an amazon gift card and figured I might as well give it a shot. I am SO HAPPY that I did. I have fair, dry, and acne prone skin. This sponge makes my makeup go on flawlessly and makes my face look almost as if my makeup was airbrushed. It doesn&#x27;t make my dry patches stand out and I have had so many compliments on my makeup just in the first week that I have been using it. One thing that I noticed was that people complained about having the pink dye come off onto their skin. I am very fair complected and this didn&#x27;t happen to me at all. One thing that I have noticed is that since you apply your makeup with the sponge damp, it is a bit moist for a while. I found that it helps a lot to use a light powder to set it. my makeup looked nice for about 10 hours, which is wonderful!! I haven&#x27;t tried cleaning it with other methods so I don&#x27;t know how well it cleans without the beauty blender cleanser, but the cleanser has a nice scent and seems to get most of the makeup out of the sponge. I love love love this product. I am so glad that I purchased this.</li>
    <li> I love this sponge.  I heard about it on gossmakeupartist/youtube. I apply  Jill Iredale liquid foundation with a flat foundation brush, then bounce it in with this, and it looks just amazing! I wet the sponge and squeeze it out, then squeeze it out again with a towel, and it is ready to use. When done, I clean with my makeup remover, DHC Olive Oil cleanser, and the sponge looks absolutely new!  Will never go back to fighting to get foundation on evenly with a brush ever again.</li>
    <li> I receive the sponge &amp; i love it very much&lt;br /&gt; I read alot of good reviews about this product&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Blend better than hand and brush on face. It make my face very smooth and natural looking. I recommend for everyone.</li>
    <li> once you figure out how this thing works, it&#x27;s totally worth it.  i would not have bought it for the original price but when you buy two and give one to your friend, it&#x27;s a good deal.  i use it to apply my concealer and my foundation.  it&#x27;s important to make sure the applicator is moist and you use as suggested or you won&#x27;t get the full effect.</li>
    <li> These sponges work a lot better with applying foundation/concealer. I&#x27;m glad I tried them. They will be part of my daily regimen.</li>
    <li> This makeup sponge is a great tool to avoid having cakey makeup. It leaves an airbrush type finish and feels light and airy on the skin. I also bought the cleaner which is really great too</li>
    <li> Good product. Excellent Job.</li>
    <li> These are amazing.  I never would have believed they could work so well.  Do not buy the knock-offs.  They do not work as well as these.</li>
    <li> Best foundation applicatior!</li>
    <li> The packaging came in perfectly. It included both sponges that I&#x27;ve bought and it came in the same plastic cylinder as shown in the picture. The size of it is about 1.8 inches and I feel very comfortable when I hold it. I have yet to use this with my concealer or foundation but the texture is quite firm and soft. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I use to use sponges for my makeup but once I found the beauty blender I bought a million of them. I love them. They are my go to makeup sponge, they work so well and leave a flawless finish with no streaking. I recommend it to all my makeup using friends</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t ever bother to buy another type of sponge again. I intend to stock up on these as soon as I make my next Amazon order. My only regret is that I did not buy the sponge cleanser. You need at least a couple at home. A couple for travel. I have heard they last a very long time. I just prefer to use clean on a daily basis so probably the ideal number for home use is 3 if you wash your brushes and sponges on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!!i love it!!  Very soft and very beautiful!! With this my  make up is professional !!! Thanks geek sellers</li>
    <li> LOVE! Worth every penny and perfectly blends. Bought the double pack because I like to one for foundation/bb cream blending, and then the other for contour blending. This is a game changer, and up my make up game. I&#x27;ve tried the other knock-off brands and Beautyblender brand is the best and has that real bounce and sponge-like consistancy. The others are cheap knockoffs that are stiff and foam rather than spongy. Knockoffs are nothing but remolded and shaped foundation sponges. Stick with the original.</li>
    <li> The packaging says it&#x27;s a beauty blender, but the actual sponge is not! This sponge is not as dense as the real beauty blender. What a waste of money.  I ended up paying a few more dollars for the real one from Sephora.</li>
    <li> I really like the product, it&#x27;s awesome and I use it often. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because the packaging is ridiculous and wasteful. Also, when I wash it, the color comes out in the soap.  It hasn&#x27;t effected the quality of the product but I thought I&#x27;d share that tidbit!</li>
    <li> I have purchased several of these and love how well they blend my makeup. I&#x27;ve never used anything that works nearly as well. The only bad things I have to say about them are that the pink comes off on everything and stains ...very difficult if not impossible to get off of anything. Very difficult to clean with soap and water. The cleaner is expensive so I haven&#x27;t purchased any thinking I should be able to clean with soap and water, but the sponges don&#x27;t look clean and they don&#x27;t hold up well under cleaning. But...I can&#x27;t beat how well they work.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my Beauty Blender sponge!  Makeup goes on smooth and natural looking.  The shape of the sponge allows you to put foundation where you want it.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute go to beauty applicator!! It applies flawlessly (any liquid foundations or concealers)  like a pro!! I always use a finishing powder, and im good almost all day, can&#x27;t say enough!!! Buy this product, watch the YouTube videos of how to do it, and you will be thrilled!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this after watching multiple people on YouTube use it and rave about it. It really does apply makeup nicely and this two sponge bundle was a great deal. I would definitely reccomend buying this.</li>
    <li> I had never used anything to apply makeup with, before buying this. My best friend is a FREAK about her makeup (literally has her own room to house it all), she recommended this to me. You run water over it, while squeezing it. It plumps up to 3 x&#x27;s it&#x27;s size and you leave it slightly damp. I use SKIN79 BB Cream (pink label) with this sponge and my face looks photo shopped. Use the fattest part of the sponge for your face and the pointy bit to get in the corners of your eyes and nose. I DAB on my makeup with the sponge, not SWIRL or SPREAD, because apparently you need to press the makeup in to your skin. I think this little trick is what allows that photo shopped look. I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been hooked on the beauty blender for 2yrs now. They last a while as long as you clean them. Better then having to buy makeup sponges all the time. I will continue to use this...</li>
    <li> I have a very blotchy, acne covered, red face, poor skin, and this covers everything! I was skeptical when I ordered these, 30 dollars for a sponge you have to be kidding me right, no these are like the best thing since 2 ply toilet paper, NASA, and a tempurpedic. They are very soft on the face, no pulling, they don&#x27;t a lot of product like a traditional sponge or brush, and give you that airbrush finish, I am so glad I ordered the dual pack!</li>
    <li> I have to say that I had high hopes for this product, the reviews were good, and the shape made sense -- add to that the cleanser, and I was excited to receive it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the sponge does not do the job well, nor is it firm enough.  Regarding cleaning it, the enclosed pads don&#x27;t do the job as well as water and some soap if neeed.  Needless to say, I&#x27;m disappointed -- this is not the \\&quot;better mouse-trap\\&quot; I hoped for. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I say skip this product as is, and let&#x27;s hope they improve it, and not just be a girly-girl pink gimmick. The packaging is darn cute though &amp;lt;g&gt;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;just my .02 for free</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical of this product.  I have been using those little triangular makeup sponges for years, and more recently, my fingers as well, and so I thought how different could this be?  The shape and texture of the sponge, plus application technique really makes your foundation look smooth and I feel even last longer.  The directions say to wet the sponge and squeeze it dry with a towel so you have a damp sponge.  Then you are supposed to stipple (sort of a dabbing motion) your foundation on your face. I would get the two-pack because if you&#x27;re going to like it, it is a much better value.  I didn&#x27;t buy the soap - I am using a very mild natural low-sudsing shampoo and it seems to do the trick. The only \\&quot;negative\\&quot; is cleaning out the sponge.  It takes a little bit of time, but the results are worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this little blender, its nice and does exactly what it says it&#x27;s gonna do. The instructions are available and easy to read.</li>
    <li> Helps me apply foundation much faster and smoother! I agree that it works just like what it says in the advertisement!</li>
    <li> I had read and heard so much about these blenders that I finally decided to give them a try. I am so happy I did. I use them everyday! They are great for blending in my concealer and also for my cream blush. I also love the pointed tip for getting around my nose, inner eye and the occasional blemish. They are for sure worth the money. You will love them!</li>
    <li> I guess they do what they are supposed to do.  I like using my fingers for application and a brush for blending a lot better. Looks and feels like the real deal too.  Give it a five because I need to learn how to use them.</li>
    <li> They didn&#x27;t last very long and really weren&#x27;t as awesome as all of the hype. Was kind of a let down. :/</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if spending this much on a makeup sponge would be worth it, but it totally was. Make up dry or wet goes on smooth and even. Love this product!</li>
    <li> This is, by far, the best make up sponge ever. It blends make up perfectly, no streaks, and you can use it for months!</li>
    <li> Just as everyone described. Great products. Makes foundation application flawless. My clients were pleased when using this tool, they constantly complimented the texture of the beauty blender.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I was skeptical about the beauty blender. I let my friend try it out first but it didn&#x27;t look it helped her much (I think she didn&#x27;t use it properly) but when I tried it (damped, of course) I was blown away by the quick, flawless application of my foundation. It really looks airbrushed and for some strange reason my foundation lasts longer! :) I use mine twice or thrice before washing it and reusing it. I plan to buy more in the future when I study abroad so that I can have a quick and easy way to apply my foundation flawlessly.</li>
    <li> Once I got the hang of how to use it, it&#x27;s all I use! Make sure you&#x27;re using liquid foundation that doesn&#x27;t have too much of a runny viscosity.</li>
    <li> I was so skeptical that for this price if these where going to be the real beauty blenders but they where! Im so happy I bought them if you have not tried the beauty blender you HAVE TO!</li>
    <li> amazing product. Use slightly wet if you want thiner layer of coverage or dry if you want more dense coverage. Expect to wash it after every three times of use.</li>
    <li> As a makeup artist, I am constantly on the lookout for new products that deliver what they promise. The Beautyblender is certainly one of those products.  I have never seen makeup apply so smoothly and evenly as when I use this little sponge. I use mine a bit damp, which allows the coverage to be built up beautifully.  I absolutely love this sponge and will be getting many more in the future!</li>
    <li> Love the item. Smooths my makeup wonderfully.  I can tell a difference when I don&#x27;t use it compared to when I do use it.</li>
    <li> I love these makeup applicators just as much as most of the other reviewers here. I always use it damp and squeeze out most of the water with a towel. It doesn&#x27;t soak up excessive amounts of product. I wash mine in warm soapy water nearly every day in Dr. Bronners liquid soap, squeeze on a towel  then leave it out to air dry. This works well.&lt;br /&gt;Just a note of caution tho. Mine got a blackish spotting on it, similar to mold. I assumed it must be due to it staying damp too much. I put it in the sink to soak in soapy water with a little bleach in it. Big mistake!! The sponge disintegrated from the bleach. So I&#x27;m back here ordering another. I&#x27;m going to alternate using the two, hoping it will have a chance to dry out thoroughly between uses.</li>
    <li> Great for Flawless foundation application. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> These are the best sponge applicators ever.  I several each year and can&#x27;t live without them.  Great for applying primer and base for a smooth, even, not over applied look.</li>
    <li> Well it&#x27;s good product but the reason I gave 3 stars is because of the price and because you can buy 10 beauty blenders from real techniques with this money and honestly I like the real technique beauty blender better,is bigger and is shaped better in my opinion</li>
    <li> Im in love with the beauty blender!!!! Makes it so easy to blend my makeup on and quickly wash and clean to store away.</li>
    <li> I finally bit the bullet and bought this, thinking I was missing something using my cheapie ones but I was SO wrong. This feels like a lesser quality and didn&#x27;t seem to blend as well or as quickly as my $4 ones. Not worth the extra $$.</li>
    <li> I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE HYPE. This just leaves a weird pattern on my face since I&#x27;m applying it with the sponge, it absorbs way more product than a brush, and I have to wet it which just makes the foundation look super oily! Blegh!</li>
    <li> Received my order on time and they are great.... They make application easy and looking flawless! It truly is better than any brush I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> The Beauty Blender gives my makeup a flawless look. I find that my makeup looks better using the Beauty Blender more than using a brush. Sometimes a brush will provide uneven coverage or causes streaks. With the Beauty Blender, my makeup is blended perfectly. I use a dabbing motion and it provides a flawless finish with great coverage. I enjoy using the pointed end of the Beauty Blender to apply the foundation around my eyes or nose. I would definitely recommend the Beauty Blender to anyone!</li>
    <li> I love the beauty blenders...</li>
    <li> The beauty blender is hands down my favorite way to blend out concealer and foundation. It leaves such a hydrated, natural finish to any foundation. I can&#x27;t live without them now and I now understand the hype around them!</li>
    <li> I like this product. I do wish the sponge was a little bigger but when you dampen the sponge, it does tend to get bigger so it makes it easier to use for an all over foundation. I am pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> Got this for my girlfriend and she loves it. she uses them every single day. worth the buy</li>
    <li> It works well as described, its my first time buying it though so I cannot confirm whether or not it is the real deal.  I looked up several youtube videos comparing the real to fakes and all the fake ones were a slightly peachier color vs. bright pink, and the ones I received seem to be the correct color and do expand to double in size when wet as they are supposed to.  BUT mine did not come with an instruction booklet so I cannot be certain.  If it is fake, it is still a pretty good product!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love!!! This is the best thing to apply make-up with.  Dampen it, squeeze it out, put dots of foundation on your face and then dab your foundation out with this thing.  Makes the makeup look flawless and perfectly natural (as long as you have the correct foundation color).  Get tons of compliments and all my friends have gone out and bought them.</li>
    <li> i love it so much so helpful , make the work so easy ;) and fast .&lt;br /&gt;give it the perfect face look .</li>
    <li> The very best for blending.  Tried other similar products nothing compares.</li>
    <li> I love the original Beauty Blender and I was very excited to see them at such a great price since usually at Sephora it&#x27;s $20 for one (I guess the good price should have been my first clue). Unfortunately, these were not real Beauty Blenders- they are a poor knock-off.  When I opened the package, it was not sealed and it was obvious the real thing had been replaced with a hard, sad imitation.  I even tried using one hoping that I was wrong and it was stiff (despite wetting the sponge), didn&#x27;t apply my foundation smoothly, and it was difficult to work with.  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I bought the Beautyblender after watching a morning TV show where the host raved about this product.  I ordered two based on her review.  This product is difficult to clean, easily torn (careful if you have long nails) and, in my opinion, an inexpensive sponge applicator is a better alternative. Please note that I had absolutely no problem with the seller.</li>
    <li> i really love it BUT my sponge broke way too early! either i was too rough with it when washing it, or the material isnt sturdy enough.. regardless i love it. i apply my liquid foundation with a brush and then use the blender to blend in the make up and get rid of any ines left by the brush.</li>
    <li> Best foundation applicaters I have ever used.  Got mine in my Pop Sugar box.. I am addicted!! ;) Great price here too!</li>
    <li> The best makeup sponge EVER.  A little spendy but well worth it.  You will not be sorry...plus... you get 2 of them. One for now and save the other for later.  I do not regret my purchase.  Beautyblender, where have you been all my life!!</li>
    <li> I never leave reviews, but these sponges are HORRID. Very scratchy, not smooth at all. I felt that my makeup wasn&#x27;t blending at all. I would totally go with Sonia Kashuks white sponges...softer, blend better. These are complete crap for the price. Waste waste waste.</li>
    <li> Someone recommended these sponges to me, and I haven&#x27;t used anything but them since! I bought one for all my friends and family to try and now we&#x27;re all hooked! Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> These sponges are not new, the package was NOT sealed and the sponges were covered in hair and fuzz and just thrown into a plastic container.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend ordered these for me as a Christmas gift. I had been wanting to try the beauty blender for a while, and had read on different forums that people got a good deal on Amazon. The sponges arrived looking identical to what I&#x27;ve seen in Sephora, and I didn&#x27;t suspect anything until I used it. These sponges are a complete waste of money. Save yourself the heartache and buy a pack of cheap $2 sponges from walmart. I did a comparison between the &amp;#34;beauty blender&amp;#34; and my cheap-o walmart cosmetic sponges, and the cosmetic sponges came out ahead. For $10 a sponge, this is a complete scam. I am really disappointed in Amazon. I assumed that if something was bought with amazon prime and fulfilled by Amazon it would be authentic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I was dissatisfied with my sponge I did some digging around and found differences in packaging from what I received vs. what is normally sold. Additionally my sponges are just a slightly different shape from the real sponges. Additionally I am not the only reviewer on amazon to notice that these are fakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those interested: I used the sponge wet, as directed, with the Urban Decay naked skin foundation which I know many people enjoy with the BB sponges. I tried many different techniques and just good not get a good result out of this sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either get the real deal or save your money and get cheap knock-offs for a decent price. This is a rip off.</li>
    <li> I love it soooooo much</li>
    <li> Very nice&lt;br /&gt;And easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Distribution of foundation cream has become more easily&lt;br /&gt;I advise to use it&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> This makes a HUGE difference when applying concealer or foundation. I gave only 4 stars beacuse of the price. It is over priced in my opinion-- for only SPONGES!</li>
    <li> This blender are fake. When I wash it, you can see the pink water coming out. And it doesn&#x27;t work as the real blender does. DONT BUY IT from here.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very wonderful</li>
    <li> not what I expected. I compared it to a beauty blender I had, this one is red &amp; the orginal (which I thought I was getting again) is pink. the texture of the new one is also different. when the item is received, it wasn&#x27;t like the picture, it&#x27;s as if they just threw it in there. I honestly believe this is a fake.</li>
    <li> Nothing can beat this make-up applicator.  I don&#x27;t know what it is but it makes my complexion look smooth and even toned.</li>
    <li> it is very good. I like it. It is an excellent for foundation makeup. try it. you will like it</li>
    <li> I love these. Every girl needs one. It really does help with great even coverage.  gets in small creases and makes makeup even.</li>
    <li> I hoped these cute blenders would do more, but they really are no better than your typical wedge makeup sponge.</li>
    <li> love love love this sponge for a fresh dewy airbrushed look! It applies evenly and uses the minimal amount of product. the knockoffs do not compare because the material of the sponge is softer and molds more to the contours of your face. Seller was fast and I had no problems.</li>
    <li> After learning this was a Beyonce must have, I had to try it. I&#x27;ve used many comparable sponges in my makeup haze. I find it&#x27;s application of liquid foundation as well as concealers good. Especially with exceptional high end cosmetics.</li>
    <li> I like using this beauty blender to apply Foundation Primer and  Liquid Foundation to my face，It never looks dry or powdery as the day goes on, it holds up very well.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t have much else to say about them. My makeup looked awesome and flawless. I will never apply makeup again without the use of this- buh by expensive brushed!</li>
    <li> I read many reviews about this before purchasing one. It is easy to use for someone who isn&#x27;t as skilled at makeup application like myself. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an easy makeup applicator.</li>
    <li> based on my sister review: the product is nice and do the job well, not sure if she recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am in love! I use these daily. I love that they are washable. Their shape is perfect for under eye blending to cover up my dark circles and bags.</li>
    <li> I use this product to apply my foundation and powder.  Purchased two this time to ensure I always have one.</li>
    <li> packaging looks genuine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sponge looks fine upon inspection -- but it&#x27;s obviously fake when you start using it. it bleeds pink, and little pieces of sponge lift and rip off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;do not buy! get it from sephora instead</li>
    <li> The best make up sponge you&#x27;ll ever use. Well worth the money spent, I&#x27;ll never use any other makeup sponge !</li>
    <li> I have repurchased multiple times.  My favorite way to apply foundation and powder under my eyes to set concealer.</li>
    <li> This sponge is like no other makeup sponge available. It&#x27;s great for applying product wet or dry. Use cream, liquid, or powder products. So soft. Makes applying makeup so effortless</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Not  the cheapest out there, but very well worth the money. Holds up way better than the cheaper alternatives. One of thos e things that the adage: you-get-what-you-pay-for applies.</li>
    <li> This product is fake!!  I knew it from the moment I put it in my hand.</li>
    <li> So-So. I wish it was not so expensive... I know this product was first on the market and yes, it does have all the qualities previously mentioned but now that other make-up gurus (sephora, Real Techniques, etc.) are catching onto this &amp;#34;sponge applicator&amp;#34; deal... They are starting to kick the beauty blender aside. Especially, the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Real Techniques by Samantha Chapman does the same thing but for $5.99! Everyone knows that is beyond a deal... So you might want to reconsider spending $30+ on this beauty blender :(</li>
    <li> 5 stars for the quality and the amazing job it does but 3 stars because theses are so tiny...even when wet they are still not as large and they appeared to be on YouTube :(</li>
    <li> I purchased my beauty blender duo pack over a year ago and with proper cleaning and maintenance of them, I expect them to last at least another year. These are a great value, considering I would&#x27;ve spent the money on disposable, cheap makeup sponges. You don&#x27;t have to keep buying replacement beauty blenders just because they are dirty. Learn how to properly clean them and they&#x27;ll last you 2-3 years. I use the beauty blender cleansing solid to clean mine, which you can also purchase here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> She was amazing. My package came within 5 days and she even included a free sample of this amazing skin exfoliation stuff. I would buy from her again in a heartbeat. She even wrote me a note to thank me. :) Such a sweet girl! As far as the products go, everything was sealed up, not damaged, and perfectly mine to open! The two beautyblenders work amazing! I am so happy I bought them. My makeup doesnt sink into my pores anymore, and it makes my skin look airbrushed. Love it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to get ready each morning before I go to work, but it is important that I look good and professional. The beauty blender is a true miracle worker. It allows me to have a clean, perfect makeup foundation in only a minute or so. I can never be without this tool!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Can see a huge difference when applying my make up. I loved them so much I bought some for my daughter, who also loves them.</li>
    <li> I love this sponge.  I was a little nervous spending $25 on two sponges, but i&#x27;m so glad i did.  It makes my make up look wonderful.... it blends so evenly!  I asked my bf if my make up looked any different,  and he responded with &amp;#34;honestly?  You look really good.  Not that you didn&#x27;t look good before, but its more blended now.&amp;#34;  That was enough of for me :)</li>
    <li> Literally best thing I&#x27;ve used to put on my foundation! I use loreal true match liquid foundation and stipple it in with this and it is just the greatest thing ever. I used to use the real techniques expert face brush and it was a real nice brush but the beauty blender is just so much better, I also used to use a dupe sponge from sephora (yellow face sponge) for the beauty blender and it sucked, nothing compared to the original beauty blender! I have combination skin and when I used a brush my dry patches would be so noticeable and would actually flake but with this my face is smooth all over, my skin is glowy and even!</li>
    <li> I ordered the beauty blend finally after I kept hearing all this hype about it. I&#x27;m a makeup artist and have put so much money into my tools and brushes that I giggled at the fact that a sponge was supposed to work better than a brush! Was I ever wrong!!! The beauty blender is amazing when using for creams and liquids. I use it for my concealer,contour,highlight &amp; foundation. It gives the most beautiful look to the skin! You will not be let down! Just stipple all over your face and \\&quot;pat\\&quot; in your concealer and you&#x27;ll be looking airbrushed in no time! Utterly obsessed!!!</li>
    <li> I have not used make-up sponges in a while but thought I&#x27;d give these a try and I am very glad I did.  These work great, they clean up well and are easy to use.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this product!The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because mine is tearing and its barely been a month that I have it, but it&#x27;s still usable and I have the second one. It&#x27;s a great value for two sponges! I would definately recommend this for makeup lovers, it makes foundation glide on  your face so smoothly.</li>
    <li> This sponge is so soft - I use it to apply eye cream, concealer and foundation. I love it because it blends the make-up into my face perfectly so it looks more natural!  Because the material is so dense (but super soft!), it is a little difficult to clean.  (I would not waste my money on the cleaner that you can buy specifically for the Beauty Blender - I tried that but really, a little soap and hot water works just as well!)  Love this product so much I bought it for my teen girls - so they wouldn&#x27;t take mine!  :)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother with the other wanna be beauty sponges out there. I&#x27;ve tried the imitations before getting this. What a difference! Beauty Blender is the Real Deal.</li>
    <li> Been using this for more than 1 year already and it is the best applicator for foundation!  Makes it look natural and evenly distributed.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and exactly as shown and described. Perfect!!!</li>
    <li> I love these little beauty blenders.  They work best when damp and leave a very nice finish on the skin!</li>
    <li> best sponge blender I tried love it, is really soft and blend the foundation really well and the price was a very good price compare to other websites</li>
    <li> I adore how this blends liquid foundation into the skin. It makes the skin look super natural and dewy afterwards. With a regular brush, you&#x27;d have to swirl it and really work it into the skin in order to avoid that sort of paintbrush stroke effect. With the beautyblender, you blot and stipple the foundation into the skin so that the makeup is perfectly blended in, and it is about a thousand times easier and faster to use than an actual stippling brush. It gives a flawless, dewy finish, and again, it is super fast and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washing - Soak it completely through with water. I actually like to wash it before I use it, instead of right afterwards. Somehow, I think it&#x27;s easier to rinse out the foundation that way. While it&#x27;s completely expanded and saturated with water (don&#x27;t squeeze out any water at this point), I pour some diluted Dr. Bronner&#x27;s* liquid soap over the foundation stains on the sponge. Then, rub the soap gently into the stains to work it into a lather without squeezing out the water. You can rub out the stains more firmly as there are more bubbles. Run it under the tap to rinse out the last of the foundation and the bubbles. Squeeze out as much water as you can with your hands and then get the last of the excess moisture out by squeezing it while having a small towel wrapped around it. I found that washing the sponge like this tends to prolong the longevity of the sponge. If you&#x27;re scrubbing at it while it&#x27;s not lathered up, you have to scrub much harder, risking ripping the soft sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*[[ASIN:B0006NH946 Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps Pure-Castile Soap, 18-in-1 Hemp Tea Tree, 32-Ounce]] I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s tea tree oil liquid soap. You can get it pretty much anywhere now - Target, Rite Aid, CVS, etc. I was already using it to clean my make-up brushes - it&#x27;s excellent for that purpose. You only need a few drops for each brush, swirl it around your wet palm, and watch it lather up like crazy and wash away everything untilyour brush is like new. Anyway, I use it on the sponge for pretty much the same reason I use it on my brushes. It doesn&#x27;t dry out the brushes or sponges, it works super well, you only need a little bit, and it&#x27;s cheaper than buying little expensive bottles of brush cleansers. Plus, tea tree oil has some natural anti-bacterial properties, which is the main reason I buy it in this flavor instead of the nicer smelling lavender or citrus one (though it&#x27;s no big deal if you use another flavor instead). Anyway, I discovered completely by accident when I was trying to use up the last of my first bottle of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s that it works even better when you dilute the crap out of it with water. It&#x27;s easier to work the sponge into a lather, and now that I know this, one bottle will probably last me two years even though I wash the sponge every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application - The sponge should now be slightly damp with no excess moisture. Then, dot liquid foundation all over your face instead of directly onto the sponge so that the sponge doesn&#x27;t accidentally suck up the foundation. Use the beautyblender to dab at, stipple, and bounce that foundation all over your face until the foundation is evenly spread and absorbed. Don&#x27;t swipe or rub. Well, you could, but the finishing effect won&#x27;t be as nice or flawless. The pointy end is best utilized on and around your nose and eyes. This is especially useful when you&#x27;re applying concealer to the under-eye area or any blemishes around the face since you can control exactly where it goes. The round end is for everything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And....that&#x27;s it! It&#x27;s super fast and easy to use (I cannot stress this enough), and it has such a great and natural effect on your skin. My mom saw me using it one day so I gave her my extra one, and she absolutely loves it. She&#x27;s sometimes a little heavy-handed with her liquid foundation as a result of using just her fingers to work in the makeup. Using this, her foundation is blended in much more naturally and even the color looks better. She said that even her friends noticed a difference with how much better her foundation looks. I just love how much faster this thing made my makeup routine while giving me a better finishing effect. So yes, this little bugger is highly, highly recommended and definitely worth the price since it will last you for a long time.</li>
    <li> Great product ! I would definitely get it again when these get worn out. My make up looks great and there isn&#x27;t too much of it when I&#x27;m going out.</li>
    <li> Omg I&#x27;m so in love with the beauty blender is awesome! I was a little skeptical about it but it&#x27;s just amazing it blends foundations beautifully and gives you a flawless finish. Every girl should have this!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Beautyblender. It gives a beautiful airbrush finish and also gives unbeatable coverage. I was skeptical even after hearing about how great this product was, but now I can&#x27;t live without it! I&#x27;m a Professional Makeup Artist and I now use this on ALL of my clients! I will continue to recommend this product to all of my clients and friends.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for make-up blending. I am a professional make-up artist and this tool is delightful. I would recommend this product to anyone who uses make-up.</li>
    <li> I am a professional make up artist based in Salt Lake City, Utah and this is my second purchase of the BeautyBlenders.&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to find a better blender on the market - that includes Pro only products from many many lines.&lt;br /&gt;When you use this product - wash it with baby shampoo first - it has some dye that has to come out before you start to use it. If you don&#x27;t like the dye idea buy it in the white - for my purposes I would never be able to keep the white from staining enough to look clean and I was mine between each client. White just likes to hold pigment.&lt;br /&gt;Always use them just damp - get them wet and squeeze out all the water you can. It works best just barely damp.&lt;br /&gt;Use soft upward circles with the larger end over your face make up - for the smaller areas like your under eye - roll the egg across the your skin to blend.&lt;br /&gt;I also use a pounce method to blend in small amounts in dedicated areas - like the cheekbones. When you pounce you push it onto your skin and slightly twist upward, very fast.&lt;br /&gt;Love these!!!</li>
    <li> Definitely worth every penny, works out my foundation perfectly!</li>
    <li> I will never use another makeup sponge again! I prefer to use it damp. Great for blending. Kinda spendy but they last a long time if you take care of them. I wash mine with baby shampoo instead of the special soap they sell. Works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised this type of product isn&#x27;t more popular. It is amazing! Concealer/ Foundation is applied flawlessly and you don&#x27;t look heavily made up at all. I think i may have to throw away my brushes now.&lt;br /&gt;oh, I knocked off a star because after a few uses, i noticed little pieces of the sponge coming off during application. Not a big deal though as it is brushed off when applying bronzer/blush.</li>
    <li> I just want to say WoW for this wonderful sponge \\&quot;Thumbs up\\&quot;. If you want your foundation to set politely on your face lol, No lines, no oiliness, not cakey or chalky, clear dry for a long time and all your skin imperfections become blurred, just try this magical sponge. This is the photoshop \\&quot;blur\\&quot; tool on the real ground.</li>
    <li> LOVE THE Beautyblenders! My fav is the black one</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the beauty blender.  It blends my liquid foundation and highlighter to a flawless finish!  Happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> If you want a flawless application to your foundation or even cream blush, use this item. It&#x27;s perfect and you end up using less make up because of it. You&#x27;re makeup never looks caked on or even dry. You just lightly wet this sponge until it expands to twice the size and then put a dab of your favorite foundation on the rounded edge and bounce around on your face. The bouncing blends into the skin and makes your skin glow. I love this! There is no substitute either. There are similar sponges out there but don&#x27;t be fooled.</li>
    <li> This little guy is the reason my foundation looks air brushed everyday! It gives me a great look and I love love love this item! I need to restock on these because my little puppy thought they were a toy :(</li>
    <li> I am over 50 and have large pores and this is the only thing I can find to fill them in and make my foundation look flawless.  I have tried several other copy cat versions and while one is very close (RE), it&#x27;s still not exactly the same thing.  In my opinion, the other copies all soak up too much foundation and doesn&#x27;t quite do the job as the real BB does.  If you&#x27;re young and pores aren&#x27;t as large, you can probably get by with one of the copies such as the RE one.  As far as cleaning, I clean mine 3 times a week to make it last longer and I do apply my foundation with the sponge wet. I have not encountered any breakouts from using the sponge at all.  I am not rating the seller as I&#x27;ve only bought mine from a licensed store.  Is it worth the price?  I can easily get 6 months out of mine so in my opinion yes it&#x27;s worth the price.  As far as the BB cleanser, I haven&#x27;t bought into that hype.  I use either my facial cleanser or Baby Shampoo.</li>
    <li> Works very well! Helps make your face look as flawless as possible.</li>
    <li> I have used these blenders for a very long time and for whatever reason this one does not seem to be authentic. Seller claims that it is and so perhaps it is a bad batch, but nothing like what I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> Shipping was super fast! I had it in like 3 1/2 days!! As for the BeautyBlender it definitely give you a flawless finish!! I have tiny fine lines under my eye by my lash line and my foundation would always crease! With this beauty blender I don&#x27;t have any creasing issues which is a huge plus for girls with fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;Before, I used a Sigma F80 so It takes some time to get use to using a sponge. I would recommend buying a cleaner too.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping and just as described!</li>
    <li> The beauty blender is absolutely perfect. I would definitely recommend this to everybody I know and it&#x27;s great for foundation as well as blending  concealer. It leave your face looking flawless!</li>
    <li> I have tried nearly every \\&quot;dupe\\&quot; for the Beauty Blender. This includes the Sephora yellow blending sponge, the one from Ulta and the London SOHO sponge you can find at Walgreens. After spending $12 for the Sephora sponge, $5.99 at Ulta for their sponge and $7.99 for the SOHO sponge, I have come to find that the Beauty Blender is definitely the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other sponge blenders are more dense. The closest to performance and feel is the SOHO sponge. The Beauty Blender cleans much better than the others as well. I have found that the more dense the sponge, the harder to clean and the easier it is to stain with the foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a good buy...2 sponges for $20 is actually less expensive than the Sephora sponge. It&#x27;s not as great a deal as the SOHO sponge, but the price differential is worth it for the higher performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you were questioning whether or not the hype was true...I&#x27;m sorry (or happy!) to report that it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helps you make a decision!</li>
    <li> Oh..Em...Gee!!! This was my daughters words exactly! It was everything and more. She loves it and I would so order it again..totally worth it.</li>
    <li> The item came in original packaging. Same blender as sold in the expensive limited beauty store but for way less.  It expanded when wet (like its supposed to). I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Better than brushes and great for dry/dehydrated skin.  Makeup looks airbrushed and flawless.  The sponge is also gentle on the skin.</li>
    <li> Love love love this beauty blender.  I was looking at you tube and many people said to get this one and not a dupe. Glad I listen because I don&#x27;t know if the others will work so good and feel as good. Highly recommend this product.  I use it for concealing.  It really even concealer.</li>
    <li> I CAN NOT BE WITHOUT THIS .lady&#x27;s do not buy these off brand it does not compare i am telling you this thing will last you longer ,and it is worth the money if you can afford it. Your make will be BEAT</li>
    <li> Just love.  No other words....  Best little invention ever.  Careful with dupes.  I bought a dupe along with the BB and they were MUCH different.  The BB is a little expensive, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.  Just take care of your sponge and keep it clean, it will last you a long time!  :-)</li>
    <li> It puts my foundation on flawlessly! The only downfall I would have to say is that it starts to fall apart. I mean it&#x27;s not like big chunks or broken in half or anything like that, but I&#x27;ve noticed that teeny little chunks have been starting to fall off. For the price, I would&#x27;ve hoped that it would hold up for a fairly long time, but I guess not.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been seeing and hearing about the beauty blender sponge mainly on YouTube from Wayne Goss. I am an avid lover and buyer or beauty products so I figured I&#x27;d try these out. Product arrived as promised in original packaging. It&#x27;s a great sponge and I like it so far. However I know now (after ordering these) that you can get the same exact product for less than $5/sponge on amazon and Sephora.  Overall impression: good product, but save some money and get the generic sponge. I still haven&#x27;t decided on whether I prefer a foundation brush or the sponge. I use them both with slightly better results from the foundation brush. However I have only used the sponge 3 times.</li>
    <li> I know the price may sound expensive for a sponge, but I love it! It makes your foundation look flawless. So glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I have used the BeautyBlender in the past for liquid foundation and fell in love with it. After watching numerous tutorials on Youtube and reading reviews, I found out it is great for concealer, foundation, cream bronzer, cream blush, and so much more! It blends wonderfully and leaves an almost airbrush result. I find it works best if you wet it with warm water and squeeze out the excess. Trust me, you will save a ton of foundation using this sponge wet/moist. A little goes a long way! It is also much cheaper to purchase on Amazon than from another site I frequent. I suggest purchasing their cleanser and using it at least once a week. Daily if you have the time. It has a light lavender scent and it makes the sponge last longer (approximately 3 months). I also use it for cleaning my makeup brushes. If you&#x27;re a makeup junky, or just looking for great makeup application, you won&#x27;t regret this purchase! Take advantage of Youtube tutorials for how to apply properly, and you&#x27;ll get great results every time.</li>
    <li> Never leaves streaks that brushes can.  As long as you wash them and let them dry properly, they last for a few months. A must have in my makeup artist kit.</li>
    <li> I like how even it makes my foundation coverage. It also applies powder quite nicely if you want a heavier coverage. My only issue is it&#x60;s annoying to get wet every time you want to use it. If you do your make up in the bathroom it is a non issue. I am not sure why it is expensive. Ive seen knock offs that look and feel exactly the same for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> Wow, I always wondered how people got their foundation looking amazing with such good coverage. This must have been their secret. I had tried a whole host of high quality foundation brushes with my liquid foundation before, including stuff like the Real Techniques brushes, Urban decay optical blurring brush, etc., and still felt like it could look better. And I was right! There&#x27;s a reason Beautyblenders are so well loved.. Just bounce this thing all over your sloppily slapped on foundation and it&#x27;ll make it so evenly distributed and pressed onto your skin that it won&#x27;t look cakey or streaky. Another really awesome advantage to these things is that when you wet the beautyblender before using it, it gives a very cool and refreshing hydration to your skin while applying any liquid foundation rather than drying your skin out during application (I normally have very oily skin too, and the hydration of the beautyblender did not bother or disturb the oil production of my skin at all, just made it feel great in the mornings!).&lt;br /&gt;I am so sad I ever tried to put on foundation without this thing, it could have been a much easier and more pleasant experience from the start!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I lived this long without the beauty blender! The application of makeup is flawless! I love it never going back!</li>
    <li> I kept one for myself and gave the other to a friend, and she loves it just as much as I do.</li>
    <li> This was the first sponge I&#x27;ve used and it works flawlessly on my skin and makes it seem like there&#x27;s nothing on it.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the hype</li>
    <li> This product is a definite FAKE. The color is slightly off, they don&#x27;t expand nearly as much as the REAL Beauty Blenders therefore, it&#x27;s alot stiffer.The shape is off, too pointy. The makeup application is different. Don&#x27;t waste your money, these are fake. Just go to sephora where yeah they may be a bit pricey but atleast youre getting the real thing AND because one real BB will last you longer than two of these.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s does what it says it&#x27;s supposed to do but I find the real techniques expert face brush to do a better job and applying foundation and it uses less product. It&#x27;s also half the price.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this thing! Wow! My daughter told me about the beauty blender months ago and I just didnt believe they worked THAT well..well I really wish I had listened then because ive been missing out! It blends foundation  flawlessly and leaves you looking fresh faced and not cakey. I recommend this lil guy to anyone who wears make up!!!! Not sure about any knock offs because I havent tried any others and this one is a lil pricey...but well worth it...trust me. Im always a skeptical person abt hypes like this, but sometimes I am wrong..like now. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> My wife swears by these, though I don&#x27;t know from personal experience, for obvious reasons--i don&#x27;t wear makeup. 😉 However, I will say that she was suspicious that she may have one received a knockoff rather than the genuine article. Make sure you can return the product if you find the same result. Now she only buys from Sephora, but I don&#x27;t see tremendous difference between those from Sephora &amp; those from Amazon.com, though I will say that the ONE package she thought was &amp;#34;less than&amp;#34; did have an odd quality to it that I haven&#x27;t seen from other Amazon.com purchases. Perhaps that particular purchase was made from a third party that was fulfilled by Amazon.com, which makes sense. Otherwise, the Beauty Blender is the choice of makeup professionals &amp; my wife every time. 😃</li>
    <li> I was very very happy and excited when I got this delivered to me. I have used the beauty blender before, I know what it does, so I was really excited when I got it. Yes, I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> This is not just a sponge, this is a little air brush machine/blender/concealer applyer.. I&#x27;m very please I bought this! Not sure I needed two but it&#x27;s nice to have an extra around</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Blends foundation more naturally on to skin. Easy to use and effective! Will definitely continue to use it regularly.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t quite see why this thing is so popular. The wedge sponges were just fine. I tried all different kinds of techniques, but still failed to see why does it cost so much for sponges. The shape in interesting and the hot pink color is just a bonus. I will not be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> heaven for those with dry skin that brushes usually just irritate. well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I would much rather use my hands and finger. I really don&#x27;t understand the purpose. I tried it but my fingers do a much better job at applying my foundation!!!</li>
    <li> Best applicator available. I have used other brands and brushes. This is by far the best one that I have ever used.</li>
    <li> After all this time I finally gave in (two for the price of one, come on!) and I am SO pleased with my Beauty Blender. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and it blends my Revlon Colorstay foundation on like a dream -- a seamless and most importantly, a finish that is NOT cakey! I also use it to blend concealer if I decide to highlight with my Maybelline Age Rewind with the same great results. The shape and size is perfect for widespread blending or reaching points around the nose. So good, so far feels very durable, so in love.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Very Good seller</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist and absolutely love the beauty blender. It&#x27;s perfect for blending and contouring. I love using it much more than a foundation and conceler brush. I would highly recommend this product, it stores and washes easy. Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> I finally decided to try the beauty blender, and although it does a great job of applying foundation for a natural finish, I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the hype. I have a brush set that cost just as much as these brushes, and it does an amazing job of applying my foundation flawlessly. I feel like the Beauty Blender sucks up a lot of the product, and then it&#x27;s hard to clean it out of the sponge. Then there&#x27;s the issue of the dye from the sponge bleeding when you wash it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it a couple of times, and then decided to just go with my brushes. I will be giving the 2nd sponge to a close friend of mine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m finally getting the hang of these, I might be unable to go without one now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several different makeup sponges and this one is a good texture, not to stiff but it still seems like it will hold up for a while.  Happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I still prefer my bobbi brown and marc jacobs brushes</li>
    <li> this item was perfect for my makeup&amp;#62; i went onto youtube to make sure i was using it correctly and it was great for evenly distributing my makeup</li>
    <li> A lot of people to buy, so buy it a try, hope and heard of, like magic easy，looks very beautiful</li>
    <li> LOVE!!  These are pretty much the greatest sponges ever made.  Doesn&#x27;t leave the makeup streaky and the point helps get hard to reach spots.</li>
    <li> Yes, this is all that it&#x27;s cracked up to be.  it shears out your make up beautifully to look natural.</li>
    <li> This sponge is very soft, flexible and a great shape with a smaller end to use around the hard to get areas of nose and mouth. Cost seems to be the only drawback.  I looked at some other less expensive but felt they lacked the softness and just appeared lesser quality to me. I may try one in the future but may have been spoiled by the Beautyblender one which appears very durable.</li>
    <li> love this thing, but i would def. recommend getting the cleaner! it&#x27;s hard to just clean it with water. other than that it leaves your skin flawless.</li>
    <li> I am an avid Sephora customer, but unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pay $20+California tax for a sponge, out of all things. I scoured through eBay &amp; Amazon and of course, Amazon is much more trustworthy when it comes to selling authentic items. Low and behold, they&#x27;re real! And amazing! So soft &amp; these sponges are very much a must have in anyone&#x27;s makeup kit. The price is what obviously sold me, two for $27?! Get outta here!</li>
    <li> Makes your foundation look flawless!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product to anyone who is having trouble applying their makeup, especially beginners!</li>
    <li> I have been buying Beauty Blender for a couple years now, and I needed one so quickly bought on here. However, I received 2 knock offs. Very disappointed. Waste of money. Wish more people were honest on here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard so much about this sponge that I finally had to see if it was worth the hype. I was pleasantly surprised that it surpassed my expectations. I&#x27;ve used several different sponges with mixed results. Most are very dense and difficult to use. I also have the Real Techniques sponge, which is great and gets the job done. I didn&#x27;t think this one would be better because I love the slanted angle of the RT sponge. This one IS better. The tear shape allows you to get into small areas like under your eye for blending concealer. It&#x27;s different from others in that it is really light and squishy and it&#x27;s very easy to use. I&#x27;m not an expert and I was able to use it immediately. Just remember to thoroughly soak it and squeeze out the extra water before using it and pat on your foundation, don&#x27;t rub.</li>
    <li> This beauty blender is amazing! The way it blends onto your skin is simply amazing! I love how fresh it feels when you apply your foundation! Deff. Recommend this to anyone who wants flawless skin! Subscribe to me on YouTube for tutorials! I will have a special video coming up soon :) Priscilla Roldan</li>
    <li> I use the Tarte BB cream and use my hands to apply it but when I use my Nars foundation I use this and it blends in perfectly. I forget to wash it sometimes but they do sell a bar soap to clean this that I would recommend. It does soak up a little bit of your foundation so I would put it on your face with your hands first and then blend don&#x27;t apply directly to the sponge. (in my opinion)</li>
    <li> I bought a pack of another brand recently, and while those are good, the Beauty Blender is unmatched.  Really like the quality and the ease of use.  Make-up goes on flawless everytime!  One of my favorite versitile make-up products.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to buy this. It is amazing. Easy use to use, blends amazingly well and doesn&#x27;t make my foundation look so cakey. Cant go back to using a brush again after this!</li>
    <li> I had a cheaper brand that wasn&#x27;t the actual beauty blender, so when it started breaking apart, I looked for this baby and found a great price on two BB&#x27;s, and it really is as good as everyone claims it to be.</li>
    <li> Hmmmm...I really do like the beauty blender...and it&#x27;s been a while since I bought these...but recently I bought a new one at Sephora and either they have changed since I bought these ones...or I got a fake one??? Even though I did like them...not as good as the ones I bought at Sephora.</li>
    <li> OMG where do I start!  This.....replaced any brush I had.... This sponge.. Is awesome!!!  I would never but another brush again.  This apply my make up with no effort.  No patches... Nothing.... Flawless.  As some might day this will make you look on fleek. Lol but the double :) you won&#x27;t have to but another for a while .</li>
    <li> Authentic super happy with my beauty blender!!</li>
    <li> Fake!  I have a real beauty blender from ulta... This is NOT real!  I have tried contacting the seller with no reply.  Do not buy this!  U can buy a blender of this quality elsewhere for a fraction of this price!  So mad!!</li>
    <li> Product same as described, great price and super fast shipping.</li>
    <li> The best thing to happen to make-up in a long time!</li>
    <li> Authentic, great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> best sponges ever for foundation application</li>
    <li> blends very well. easy to use</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and great product. It&#x27;s 2 for the price of one, which you can&#x27;t get anywhere else. This is my second purchase in a year!</li>
    <li> blends amazingly. blends foundation, concealer, and all creamy products just perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have the beauty junkies sponges that come in a set of of 4 for $15 and I heard so many great reviews about the beauty blender I knew I just had to try it. And honestly I like it yes. It&#x27;s extrmely soft. But I actually prefer my beauty junkies sponge over the beauty blender it gives a lighter more natural Finnish than the beauty blender.</li>
    <li> these are my favortie.  They will not fall apart and blend nicely</li>
    <li> I had read several rave reviews about the Beauty Blender. Finally I decided to purchase and it is wonderful. It makes my foundation application so easy and looks flawless on my face. I will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> I am so in love with the beauty blender!!!! It just makes it so much easier to apply my foundation and makes my makeup look flawless......</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product.  Love it.  Arrived quickly. a a a a a a a a a a aa a</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE SPONGE APPLICATOR, IT IS SO EASY TO PUT MY MAKEUP ON AND GET OUT THE DOOR EARLY IN THE MORNING WITHOUT, WASTING EXCESS MAKEUP.</li>
    <li> I have only used this with cake/compact makeup, and it works well.  You have to be careful not to pounce too much in one spot, but once you get the hang of it, it really does leave you with an airbrush look.  I use it to blend my blush and eye shawdows too.</li>
    <li> These are NOT the real beauty blenders.&lt;br /&gt;These are a tad harder, but don&#x27;t let them fool you.</li>
    <li> I saw the price on this and I know how expensive they are, do I snagged up one for me, one for my sister in law, and one for my mother in law (Birthday gifts for them). They were/still are a hit! I really like how easy it is to use and how nicely it smooths my makeup over my face. Great product! I just bought a airbrush machine, so  interested to see how that stands up to this. I&#x27;m really pleased with the beauty blender.</li>
    <li> Got this for a friend of mine for her birthday and she enjoyed it.  Can&#x27;t really describe it, never saw it in person.  But she loved it.  So guess it was good. :)</li>
    <li> From the cover and box, this looks like the real thing. But when you wash it, you&#x27;d feel that the density is different, the pink colour runs and the texture of the sponge is more &#x27;furry&#x27;-looking. My original BeautyBlender that I got from Sephora is less dense, more pointed at the tip and the colour NEVER runs while washing. Too cheap to be true!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these sponges. I&#x27;ve just made my way back to liquid foundation from using powder for several years, and of course I read many reviews and watched many youtube videos on the latest techniques. That&#x27;s how I stumbled upon the beautyblender. It works like a dream! Foundation goes on seamlessly - no neck line! It&#x27;s a little more time consuming than just slapping it on with your fingers or applying powder foundation with a brush, but the finish is worth the extra effort. You use it wet so it actually soaks up just a little product as you apply it as opposed to using a dry sponge or foundation brush (I&#x27;m not a fan of that method). I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for the best possible way to apply their makeup.</li>
    <li> I love these make up sponges. Yes, they&#x27;re expensive, but they do the job beautifully and gives the most natural finish to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: I was it with 91% Alcohol so it removes all of the make up and bacteria. Some color does come out of the sponge, and it stains, so be careful when doing this. I love to clean it with alcohol because its faster than any other method, and it dries pretty quickly, this method is useful when you have to use it multiple times, and to kill the bacteria when using it on different people.</li>
    <li> I received my package, only to discover that they were not the real beauty blender sponges</li>
    <li> I like! Great product, works very well.  I plan to make the Beauty Blender a permanent addition of my makeup bag.</li>
    <li> love the way any foundation concealer goes on and the look is fantatic, love that natural look will be purchasing more of the beauty blenders.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without my beauty blender!!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my beauty blender.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone!  Plus, one lasts so long, if you take care of it properly, so I was able to give the second one as a gift to my mother (who also LOVES hers!)!</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about this tool, especially considering the cost in comparison to other less expensive dupe blenders available, BUT this is an absolute must for anyone who uses liquid foundation and/or concealer! The original Beauty Blender sets liquid makeup for a flawless, almost airbrush looking finish! Expect amazing results!</li>
    <li> I love this product I have used many different applicators over the years but this is the best yet! A must have!</li>
    <li> I watched youtube make-up videos and all the gurus highly recommanded this egg beauty blender. it is very pricy but I still went ahead and bought these. I used it for a while by now and it is amazing. I love how it blends the foudations. I will definitely buy these again.</li>
    <li> Works very well to buff your foundation on, it looks very natural and does not suck up lots of foundation so there&#x27;s very minimal waste.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have been dying to try it. When it came in the mail I was super excited and I tested it right away. Wow the results were amazing I instantly looked so flawless and my skin looked so perfect. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars was because it&#x27;s too expensive. I have ordered a dupe for it and I hope that the dupe will work just as great as this product does. I am very cheap and I do not like to spend my money too much.</li>
    <li> Everytime I use it I get perfect seamless application! Highly recommend it to anyone who is lazy about doing their make-up. Quick application.</li>
    <li> I was expecting to be highly disappointed after spending so much on sponges. Surly, they wouldn&#x27;t make my makeup look any better than it does when I use my hands, brushes or cheap sponges. Well, I was wrong. They are fabulous! They help smooth out my makeup to a degree I never thought possible. They even make my thick laura mercier concealer look natural. Love!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see what all the hype is about with this sponge! Yeah, my make up goes on well with it but using a brush to apply my foundation works just as well. This sponge is over priced for sure. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to be in your MUST HAVES. My sponge cracked after several uses, not too happy at all.</li>
    <li> I was so happy with the product because it actually do an excellent job blending my foundation, but I found out that is not the original beauty blender and I was so dissapointed, it even came in a box exactly as the real one.</li>
    <li> These will change the way you wear makeup. They make my foundation and concealer blend perfectly. Using these also speeds up my routine because I know I&#x27;m not leaving any streaks or cake-y spots.</li>
    <li> This is my 5 beauty blender that I got and I am sooooo happy with it !&lt;br /&gt;It blend my foundation and concealer perfectly and easy to clean, I don&#x27;t think i want to go back using brush for foundation and concealer ever again !!!&lt;br /&gt;Buy it and you won&#x27;t regret it :)</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the real deal thing and truly works! i love the way it applies foundation to the skin and how soft and bouncy it is!</li>
    <li> I was really unsure about these sponges when they first came out but I love them.  They are perfect for blending out foundation for a flawless look.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Works best when wet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other brands of make-up sponges and nothing compares to this. Its well worth the money even though a bit pricey. Very soft and blend your makeup beautifully. Soft enough for gentle use on under eye and eyelids too to blend concealer and give you a flawless finish. They wash out with mild soap and water pretty easily too. Mine have lasted a little over a year and I apply makeup and use them everyday.</li>
    <li> So soft and applies my liguid foundation the best out of any brush I have used. I also find that when I use this it distributes more evenly and alot faster than a brush so for me is a must when I apply  foundation. i also use the pointy side for blending out concealer.</li>
    <li> love this product!! It blends so well, I honestly can&#x27;t use any other product to put foundation on my face. The only down side is that you HAVE to clean it after every use or else your next make up application wont be as perfect.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite makeup sponge I have ever used.  I highly recommend it and I have told several people about them.  I like how soft and easy it is to use, and how easy it is to get in the corners of your eyes due to it&#x27;s shape.  Also it does not fall apart like some sponges do.</li>
    <li> I love the way this Beauty Blender makes my foundation application so much faster plus giving me flawless coverage!!!No more brushes for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard all the hype about the beauty blender. I&#x27;ve tried store brands versions, such as Soho and Sonia Kashuk- Nothing compared to the softness and effectiveness of this makeup applicator. It is so amazing. Easy to use, soft touch to skin, very easy to blend liquid makeup; Easy to clean and care for; It is definitely worth the cost..I was especially excited to be able to purchase a 2 pack of the Beautyblender at an awesome price. I&#x27;m so happy I gave in and bought the original Beautyblender.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used regular sponges, stippling brushes, Sigma kabukis, my fingers, etc. to apply makeup in the past and while they all had their pros, nothing is quite as amazing as the Beauty Blender!!! It makes foundation application absolutely fool proof. Even foundations that didn&#x27;t look great on my before suddenly performed like high end makeup when I used the BB. I was skeptical at first and concerned that a lot of product would soak into the sponge and go to waste, but something about the texture of the BB plus wetting it before use prevents that from happening. The end result is immaculately applied makeup that looks flawless and even. Even full coverage foundation doesn&#x27;t look cakey, the sponge sheers it out just the right amount. Could this be my holy grail makeup product? Hell yes.</li>
    <li> I had heard a lot of hype about this product prior to purchasing it and finally decided to cave and give it a try.  Happy to report that I really love using it.  The shape helps you get foundation in all the nooks and crannies of your face and it really helps give you a flawless look.  I&#x27;m definitely impressed.</li>
    <li> So far so good! I cant wait to use this on the beach so I can get perfect flawless lightweight coverage.</li>
    <li> How did i live without this &amp;#34;essential&amp;#34; in my beauty bag.  Heard about it from a Make Up Artist friend and my 14 year old niece the same week.  This is the only Make Up sponge you&#x27;ll ever need.</li>
    <li> waiting for long time ,the spongw is skiny then others, U can use to foundation and wet powder , it easy to cover you nose pore</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Beautyblender for about a week now and I love it! It evens out my foundation and keeps it from looking splotchy and streaky. I was initially hesitant at first because of the high price, but now I&#x27;m not quite sure how I&#x27;ve survived this long without it. My previous applicators have absorbed so much foundation that I ended up using way more than neccessary--not anymore! I&#x27;ve also discovered that using a few squirts baby shampoo to clean it works just as well as the BB cleaner (and costs a fraction of the price). My only complaint is that my dog loved it so much too that when I accidentally dropped it in front of her, she had it destoryed in about 30 seconds...but that&#x27;s completely my fault! Anyways, it is DEFINITELY worth the price!</li>
    <li> fits into areas of the face neatly and with patting, applies foundation evenly and lightly!  I bought 2 of these 2/pkg so I have plenty on hand.  They last a long time as you can wash them out.  Nice product!</li>
    <li> Love my beauty blenders!!!!!!!! They are awesome..perfect for blending foundation. I would highly recommend them!! A must have in your makeup box</li>
    <li> Perfect for a light natural look! Also worked great with my concealer. Cleaning is a little tricky but my mild soap worked fine.</li>
    <li> Not sure what i was looking for. Some magical properties that only the beautyblender could provide after all the rave reviews by youtube gurus and makeupbloggers. But the use is almost anticlimactic... it does what it says but i dont&#x27; see any comparable benefit than using my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its probably really good for when you&#x27;ve got a thick foundation that needs a moist application so it doesnt set too quickly and maybe a cream/liquid blush because a larger application surface gives better blending than fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you&#x27;re soley purchasing this to have airbrushed makeup, the results are pretty but not much different than you should be able to achieve with fingers/ or standard brushes.</li>
    <li> I love this but which I had a carrying case for it...</li>
    <li> Loved my beauty blender! It started out by working amazingly, I used it everyday for weeks, when I washed it I was instantly turned off by the obnoxious amount of pink dye that leaked everywhere! made me wonder what on earth that was doing to my face! also the amount  of makeup that washed out made me realize a ton of product was being wasted and when you buy 30$ foundations that&#x27;s a big no-no in my book! however I continued the use this time with a cheaper drug store foundation, simply because the coverage it was providing was amazing. however, the beauty blender tore within weeks of use simply from squeezing the water out! all of these major flaws 100% convinced me I was sent a FAKE. which is extremely irritating considering the price tag, next time I&#x27;ll be going directly to Sephora!</li>
    <li> FAKE PRODUCT, THIS IS NOT THE REAL BEAUTY BLENDER,</li>
    <li> I gave other similar makeup sponges a try and won&#x27;t again. These are worth the price and they do their job.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loveeeeee this !!!! i use it every day !!!! the money was well spent !!!!!! and it was worth it !!!</li>
    <li> The Beautyblender is now the only thing I use for my foundations, concealers, powders, and blushes.  I&#x27;ve only used it while damp.  It gives your skin that natural looking glow and doesn&#x27;t make your makeup look cakey at all.  A must in every makeup kit!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend the beauty blender for foundation application. It provides a flawless finish and is easy. The beauty blender works much better than even the best brushes, sponges, or fingers. I won&#x27;t apply foundation with anything but a beauty blender now that I&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
    <li> I had seen this on several YouTube tutorials for make up. Let me say I love my lil beautyBlender. I use it for my base and makeup. Like how simple it is to use and how it creates flawless effect. I ordered the 2 I gifted the other one to my mom to try and she Loved it aswell.</li>
    <li> I used to use a foundation brush from sigma to apply my foundation, but that made a lot of foundations look streaky on my face and I was getting sick of using that brush so I wanted to try a different method since I don&#x27;t like using my fingers to apply foundation. I&#x27;ve heard a lot about the beauty blender and thought I would give it a shot, and I really really like them. They seem to apply my foundation quicker, I feel like it looks nicer, and they&#x27;re easy to clean. They are pretty easy to rip though, when squeezing the water out of one while cleaning it, and I accidentally dug my nails into it so now there&#x27;s tiny rips on it from my nails. Not a big deal, it&#x27;s still able to be used.</li>
    <li> Really like this product true to its advertisement! It does what its suppose to do and yes I do put it in water to work perfectly. I just need to buy the cleanser for it.</li>
    <li> This product is simply amazing and cuts makeup application time in half!!  Blends out foundation, concealer, highlights, etc., absolutely PERFECTLY!</li>
    <li> I love this! It&#x27;s easy to use, very gentle on ur skin, easy to clean. I would so recommend it to anyone looking for makeup essentials</li>
    <li> is with one of these sponges! It allows for such a light, even application of any foundation, and I love not having to worry about seeing brush lines when the foundation sets. They&#x27;re really easy to clean too, even if you don&#x27;t use the recommended cleaner. I tend to just use my current oil cleanser to break down whatever foundation has dried into the sponge, rinse clean, and then I use Dawn dish soap to get rid of whatever the oil cleanser left behind - and the sponge looks brand new!</li>
    <li> I bought this after I saw a review on youtube and Im glad I did. I love this and I will buy this again and again and again I just wish it wasnt so expensive.</li>
    <li> I heard so many good comment about this product so I bought it but it. Turn out in my opinion, not so great like people saying it. Just like other simple makeup applicator. Nothing too special about it</li>
    <li> I bought it for my sister 2 months ago.she highly recommended it and asked me to buy two more. It&#x27;s really amazing</li>
    <li> These sponges allow the smooth application of make up without absorbing and wasting the foundation!!  Had not used them before, but can&#x27;t imagine not using them now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been busing this sponge for a couple of years now. They&#x27;re amazing only thing is the soap that comes with it is just alright.</li>
    <li> Great beauty sponges.  Make up applications and blending is excellent!</li>
    <li> I am disappointed in this item. I am usually not skeptical about &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; products, but now I am. My beauty blenders are cheap, and the sponges are ripping and pieces have come out. Paying $26 for a cheap sponge is crazy. I am think I will purchase one from Sephora and check out the differences.</li>
    <li> Beauty blenders are a must have in your makeup collection!</li>
    <li> This is my third set. I love using these for foundation application. The finish is flawless and no streaks and the point can get in all the small places near the corners of eyes and nose.</li>
    <li> It is very famous among my friend, and this is the first time that I buy it. It is very soft and very useful to makeup!!</li>
    <li> i havent got my product yet, it has been more than 1 one week..i really dont get why is taking so long if its inside the US...and it makes me really mad. im really dissapointed. i need my money back if it doesnt get home by this week.</li>
    <li> My wife uses them often and loves them.</li>
    <li> I had read many reviews about the beauty blender. I have always just used a regular applicator sponge or my fingers. Never again. This sponge applies foundation equally and flawlessly. It is perfect for those hard to reach contour creases such as your nose. I will never use another makeup sponge again.</li>
    <li> Amazing - I didn&#x27;t think it would live up to all of the hype, but it did! It&#x27;s so quick and easy to use, and your foundation blends in really well with your skin.</li>
    <li> I loveeee the beauty blender, it&#x27;s the best way To apply foundation, concealer and blush! You use less product and the application is evenly. I have all sorts of brushes but this sponge does the job much better!</li>
    <li> I love how it works but it gets dirty so fast (literally after 2 uses it&#x27;s a mess) and reusing it without thoroughly cleaning it doesn&#x27;t feel right at all. But, if you&#x27;re going to buy one, do not get the ones from Marshalls or the markets because they DO NOT work. This one works!</li>
    <li> I did not get these for makeup.  I got them to help with pottery making.  I expected them to be flat, not round.  They might work well with makeup, but I would not get them again for use with pottery.</li>
    <li> Great - but you can find less expensive - I found out later</li>
    <li> If you are new to beauty blenders then you need to buy this immediately. It makes whatever foundation I put on flawless, better than my $100 brushes.</li>
    <li> Love using the beauty blender to put on my make-up. The application and finish is so much better than using regular makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> Fake. These aren&#x27;t real beauty blenders. They bleed pink when they are washed with the beauty blender solid cleanser. I can totally tell now that I&#x27;ve bought an authentic one from sephora.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the beauty blender.  Very fast shipment and easy transaction.  Great seller...highly recommended! Thank you</li>
    <li> This is probably one of the best makeup tool that any makeup junkie as myself can own. It makes your foundation as well as concealer, blush, to look natural. It reduces the appearance of pores and removes the harsh lines that can be caused my the makeup! This product is a must-have!</li>
    <li> There is no cheap duplicate. I have expensive Chanel and MAC brushes. For an evening out when I want flawless makeup, this is THE TOOL. this is one item the makeup gurus on YouTube all agree on and I agree with them. I&#x27;m not a makeup artist. I just want to look like someone &amp;#34;did my makeup&amp;#34; when I have an important event, know I will be photographed, or need that confidence boost nothing like full makeup can give a girl immediately.&lt;br /&gt;This makes foundation application effortless and truly airbrushed. The only place I could find it was on Amazon. I ordered more as stocking stuffer-ish gifts for my mom next door friends who immediately noticed how amazing my makeup looked.&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that you can sheer your makeup down and actually save product with this.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing. Love it! Seems pricey, but you get 2 in the pack and its pretty indestructible.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read reviews last year about this \\&quot;wonder sponge\\&quot; and thought I would give it a try. After reading majority reviews stating it promotes a flawless, air brush look, I wanted to try it even more. So, the first time I used the sponge I have to say the application is flawless and so easy to apply. I also love the small amount of foundation you need compared to other foundation brushes/sponges etc. So I&#x27;m saving A LOT more money on foundation ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also read reviews stating the brush won&#x27;t clean correctly. I&#x27;ve had my sponge for almost a year and it&#x27;s still in great condition. I just use baby shampoo and anti-bacterial soap to disinfect after each use. Although, there is color from the foundation still on the sponge, my skin has not broken out. I presume the sponge hasn&#x27;t harbored too much bacteria. In my opinion, there isn&#x27;t any sponge that compares to this one! Definitely worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;I am ordering two more now!</li>
    <li> this was by far the best make-up sponge i have ever used and normally i use a kabuki brush it made my foundation look flawless and loved that you just bounce it on your skin. best product.</li>
    <li> The beauty blender did everything it said it would. I was skeptical at first about buying it because I had never used a sponge for my makeup application, but now I will never use never use another product. My makeup has never looked better or lasted longer. Anyone considering buying this, just do it. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> The beauty blender offers something special that makeup brushes can&#x27;t. I am a makeup lover and this blended my products amazingly. I use it with liquids, creams and even powders. Glad I bought into the hype</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen so much about the beauty blender.  I finally brought myself to spend $19 on 2 sponges, which I thought was too much.  I do like them, foundation looks flawless and gives great coverage.  Does not leave streaks like with a foundation brush.  I have been using the beauty blender ever since.</li>
    <li> Perfect price!!!!! I love this product I use these all the time for my clients it makes me a superstar.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the wedged sponges since I started using foundation and this sponge IS different. It&#x27;s VERY quick to put on your foundation as well as easy to apply too much because it doesn&#x27;t look like you have a ton of makeup on. (does that make sense?)</li>
    <li> Beauty blender sponges are the best...better than any foundation brush, and you can use for concealer and cream blushes as well. The coverage is SO flawless, and it looks airbrushed. A little pricey for a sponge, but since you wash and re-use it, you get your money&#x27;s worth!!</li>
    <li> Oh boy is this cute little thing incredible! I will keep this brief (could go on and on!) You you never realize how much of a difference a beautyblender sponge makes on your skin versus just a brush or regular sponge! Just get it damp, squeeze it out and blend away! So easy to apply your makeup and gives a flawless appearance! Looks like I&#x27;m not even wearing makeup! This is my secret weapon(: LOVE THIS!</li>
    <li> Love these so much. Nothing has come close</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t second guess yourself! just buy it! you won&#x27;t regret it at all :) worth every penny spent!!!!!!!!  :0) :)</li>
    <li> These are really great for applying a smooth coat of foundation!</li>
    <li> I love thes beauty blenders. They help apply foundation more evenly and are easy to clean. Just rinse with warm water and squeeze dry. I was glad that they came in a 2 pack.</li>
    <li> They are the best out there and I won&#x27;t buy any other one.  Love them and the pink color.  :)</li>
    <li> A very important product for makeup and gorgeous packaing</li>
    <li> I saw a make up tutorial where the artist used this and was blown away. I wanted to get one but when I looked online, the price made me shy away.&lt;br /&gt;My mother just bought the cheaper knock off blender (more of a bell shape). It was hard and didn&#x27;t really swell up and didn&#x27;t apply the make-up really any differently than your fingers. So just sprang for the real beauty blender. From the first second I loved it! Even my husband and daughter (8yrs) wanted to &amp;#34;play&amp;#34; with it. It is WORTH EVERY PENNY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the cleanser, i didn&#x27;t get that, I&#x27;m just washing mine with dish soap, and it works great.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I am a self proclaimed makeup and beauty product junkie. I&#x27;m always trying new products, makeup brushes etc. So after seeing this sponge all over the web I figured I&#x27;d give it a try although $20 for a makeup sponge seemed a little pricey, I found a great 2 for 1 deal here. Anyway I recommend if you buy it that you watch a tutorial on you tube on how to use it. There is a stippling method where you wet the sponge before applying foundation so it doesn&#x27;t absorb all the makeup and gives you a lighter coverage. I love the beauty blender and have been using it every day for 3 weeks now. I get a ton of compliments on my \\&quot;beautiful skin\\&quot; ever since. The only thing I will say is it can be a little hard to clean. I try to do it at least once a week and I use my Dr. Bronners Castile soap. That works pretty well. Just soap and rinse several times.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like using sponges, but this one covers well. I&#x27;m not sure about how much product it absorbes vs. how much it actually blends on to the face, but it applies way smoother than using my hands or a flat foundation brush.</li>
    <li> It is a great thing to buy! I don&#x27;t see the big hype about buying the original. I think the knock-offs work just as well! Still great (:</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what the secret is but this really works ! If you follow the instruction it will save you a lot of money in the long run on your make up. It gives you a flawless look and best coverage.&lt;br /&gt;I am in my fifties and have had already a few compliments on how my skin looks !&lt;br /&gt;I followed the advise in one of the other reviews . I let the sponge dry first and clean it the next day before use. I found that it will clean a lot easier .</li>
    <li> only problem is cleaning..... not all the make up gets out.. :(... i still use it but i started to clean it after each use thats all</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t mean to be dramatic, but this product legitimately changed my life (my beauty life.) In the past, I struggled to apply foundation and therefore I rarely wore it and owned only a few foundations. Now, I love foundation, wear it almost daily and I own so many! This allowed me to apply foundation effortlesly and blended it flawlessly! Love it and can&#x27;t live without it! I highly recommend getting the pack of 2 as it is more cost effective.</li>
