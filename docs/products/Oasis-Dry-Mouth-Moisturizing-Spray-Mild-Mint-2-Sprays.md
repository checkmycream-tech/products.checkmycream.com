      <li>[Oasis Dry Mouth Moisturizing spray] It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

      <li>although I wasn&#x27;t familiar with the Oasis brand, I purchased a package of 2 for comparison to the one I already had..</li>
      <li>This spray is not the most consistent to fully coat the inside of your mouth.  </li>
      <li>This is great for your purse to use whenever you get that dry mouth feeling.  </li>
      <li>but nothing special.</li>

      <li>About the only good thing is the taste.  </li>
      <li>Everything as described, quick shipping, no</li>

      <li>kept mouth feeling fresh and moist</li>
      <li>I like the taste even better than my old brand</li>
      <li>Oasis dry mouth sprays are the best I have found for my dry mouth and lack of saliva caused by Sjogren&#x27;s disease.  </li>
      <li>The small size is a great plus.</li>
      <li>The spray is more convenient, as expected.</li>
      <li>The pump also malfunctions very easily.&lt;br /&gt;Spray</li>
      <li>Father uses this for his &amp;#34;Dry Mouth&amp;#34; problem and says that it really helps.</li>
      <li>A thumbs up from mom is worth ten stars!</li>
      <li>It was nothing but normal mouthwash.</li>
      <li>The top twists open and closed.  </li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t very expensive which is good, but it still wasnt worth the money.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not missing the cap - it doesn&#x27;t come with a cap.  </li>
      <li>If you have a dry mouth, forget the mouthwash, this is all you really need.</li>
      <li>I love the Oasis products, but the mouthwash is very hard to find.</li>
      <li>It is more of a heavy dribble that runs down your throat.</li>
      <li>I have a real problem with dry mouth, not only because of my meds, but because I sleep with my mouth open.  </li>
      <li>not dry stomach.</li>
      <li>it really works when I get my dry mouth really dry after all my medication and</li>
      <li>After I decided to get a mouth moisturizer, I unsuccessfully looked for a spray in the other, highly advertised brand.</li>

<li> I usually use Biotene mouth spray, but haven&#x27;t been able to find that lately, so I settled for this.  </li>
<li> Poor design as the fluid seeps out leaving a sticky mess around the top.</li>
<li> Dry mouth is not a minor irritation.  </li>
<li> Works well but one sprayer doesn&#x27;t last long!  </li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
<li> Who knew cancer treatment left you with dry mouth?</li>
<li> I used to use a different brand dry mouth spray, but then I could find that anywhere - even online sources said it was out of stock.</li>
<li> I gave it two stars because it does help with dry mouth, but doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
<li> These containers hold so little and last only a very short time!  </li>
<li> The only problem is that they do drip,even when in the closed position.</li>
<li> Even if the other brand comes back, I&#x27;m staying with Oasis.</li>
<li> Because of medicines I take, my mouth is always painfully dry.  </li>
<li> Some medications cause dry mouth</li>
<li> This has helped for my medication-related dry mouth.</li>
<li> and it does the job of moisturizing a dry mouth.  </li>
<li> I have dry mouth  </li>
<li> I have a very dry throat and mouth from medications, reflux and allergies and Oasis keeps me from being painfully dry, even during the night.</li>
<li> The moisture quality is about the same as any other moisture product and only lasts a few minutes.</li>
<li> Dry mouth has been a problem for my wife for some time!</li>
<li> But each little container only lasted about 2-3 days.  </li>
<li> Tiny little tubes.</li>
<li> There is always a little spray that ends up on the outside of the spray bottle so that it ends up getting sticky if you don&#x27;t have something to wipe it on after each spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the products it have tried I would recommend the OraCoat XyliMelts.</li>
<li> I have been trying a variety of things suggested by my doctor to help with my extreme dry mouth.</li>
<li> It was not real.  </li>
<li> Not what I expected.</li>
<li> It helps dry mouths for less than 10 seconds.</li>
<li> I keep some Oasis with me all the time -- a small bottle in my purse (and even in bed with me at night) and a larger bottle in the bathroom.  </li>
<li> There are other brands that I haven&#x27;t tried</li>
<li> Small enough to carry so</li>
<li> I LIKE these little take alongs due to extreme dry mouth.</li>
<li> I always use a few squirts of Oasis before retiring for the night, and it helps me fall asleep without the dry mouth causing difficulty relaxing.</li>
<li> Well,problem #2 is that they are rounded on the bottom so you can not sit them down.</li>
<li> I have chronic dry mouth (dentist diagnosed) and usually use biotene</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the spray I love this so much that I also gave one to my dad and he loves it too it really works when I get my dry mouth really dry after all my medication and my asthma pump doing the day or night I just used two pumps and I&#x27;m good I will recommend this to anyone and I would definitely be purchasing again</li>
    <li> Oasis dry mouth sprays are the best I have found for my dry mouth and lack of saliva caused by Sjogren&#x27;s disease.  Unfortunately I am unable to find it in any of my local stores anymore.  They taste better than Biotene sprays.</li>
    <li> If you have a dry mouth, forget the mouthwash, this is all you really need.</li>
    <li> The product I received was not the product that was advertised.</li>
    <li> Awful.....leaks everywhere and it comes out as a liquid ooze type substance, not a spray.</li>
    <li> I have chronic dry mouth (dentist diagnosed) and usually use biotene but they don&#x27;t have a traveling spray.  So I thought I would give this one a try.  This spray is not the most consistent to fully coat the inside of your mouth.  It does moisturize the mouth ‘temporarily’ but doesn&#x27;t seem to have any long-term effect.  Also I am unable to keep it in my purse as one of them leaked immediately; though the other one has not yet begun to leak I&#x27;m wary that it might start and make a huge mess.</li>
    <li> Oasis spray does the job of keeping the mouth from drying out.  I have a very dry throat and mouth from medications, reflux and allergies and Oasis keeps me from being painfully dry, even during the night. The taste is very light and minty. Good product!</li>
    <li> This is great for your purse to use whenever you get that dry mouth feeling.  I love the Oasis products, but the mouthwash is very hard to find.</li>
    <li> Actually works and tastes good</li>
    <li> Tiny little tubes. Poor design as the fluid seeps out leaving a sticky mess around the top. Too tiny and thin to stand upright so when I place it on my bedside stand, it falls over and leaves sticky gunk on the furniture. Stick with Biotene Spray, if you can find it.</li>
    <li> Just OK but nothing special.</li>
    <li> When I received this item, it only had one spray bottle and not the two as it should have. After contacting Amazon, they corrected the problem quickly. Therefore, any future purchases will be made locally so that I&#x27;m assured of getting what I&#x27;m paying for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Father uses this for his &amp;#34;Dry Mouth&amp;#34; problem and says that it really helps. So, 5 Stars to Oasis for making something that works. But, 4 Stars for not packaging the two pack better.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quite thick, like a cooking oil.  It&#x27;s not missing the cap - it doesn&#x27;t come with a cap.  The top twists open and closed.  It oozes after every use - mess.  The bottom is not flat, it&#x27;s rounded - it can&#x27;t set upright.  Why? The taste is pretty bad, I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it.  I gave it two stars because it does help with dry mouth, but doesn&#x27;t last long.  If I get desperate I might use it.  Listerine spray is better for me.</li>
    <li> It was supposed to have 100 sprays, but it fizzled out after around 20 to 25 sprays.  I would never  buy it again.</li>
    <li> valves leaked on both units and left hands, pocket, etc sticky. Ironic that mfger&#x27;s ads brag about their great no leak valves.</li>
    <li> Dry mouth has been a problem for my wife for some time! This takes  care of the problem temporarily mouthwash lasts longer.</li>
    <li> It is great.  Small enough to carry so you have it with you and it does the job of moisturizing a dry mouth.  The small size is a great plus.</li>
    <li> Works quite well for a short while. I like the taste much better than Biotene. The longest lasting product I have used is Oragel.</li>
    <li> The moisture quality is about the same as any other moisture product and only lasts a few minutes. I use it for public speaking. The sprayer doesn&#x27;t spray very well, more like a stream squirted into your mouth (or throat if your aim is a bit off). Tastes better than the gel in the tubes you can buy. Nice, portable size.</li>
    <li> Suddenly this stuff was gone from the shelves. Read about the specious recall, but it never returned to the shelves. Then it hit me: WEB SEARCH!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t always find this in any stores so I guess online is the only way.  It does work though; better than biotene.</li>
    <li> I LIKE these little take alongs due to extreme dry mouth.The only problem is that they do drip,even when in the closed position.Well,problem #2 is that they are rounded on the bottom so you can not sit them down.</li>
    <li> I have been trying a variety of things suggested by my doctor to help with my extreme dry mouth. This product is one of the worst of tried. It doesn&#x27;t feel any better even right after a spray. There is always a little spray that ends up on the outside of the spray bottle so that it ends up getting sticky if you don&#x27;t have something to wipe it on after each spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the products it have tried I would recommend the OraCoat XyliMelts. They are magnificent and take away all dry mouth symptoms. They are just a bit more expensive. But hey compared to throwing money away like I did on this product. XyliMelts are worth it to not be afraid to speak because of how bad my breath was when I had dry mouth.</li>
    <li> Everything as described, quick shipping, no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product works, but only briefly. After it dissipates in a minute or so the relief also goes away. But, better than nothing.</li>
    <li> It was not real.  It was nothing but normal mouthwash. It is called a rip off. Problem is.....I bought a lot of it.</li>
    <li> I think I will use biotene  from now on. It has much less of an after taste  than the Oasis spray.</li>
    <li> I had to send it back. It&#x27;s very thick like spraying Glue  in your mouth. Numbs your mouth like sucrets. Not what I expected.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t do without this. One of my medications dries out my mouth so thoroughly that I can&#x27;t speak easily. One squirt and I&#x27;m set for quite a while.</li>
    <li> This was a disappointing product.  I usually use Biotene mouth spray, but haven&#x27;t been able to find that lately, so I settled for this.  It worked okay I suppose.  But each little container only lasted about 2-3 days.  It wasn&#x27;t very expensive which is good, but it still wasnt worth the money.</li>
    <li> Works just okay.  It leaks a lot so they need to do something with the functionality of the pump.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
    <li> Works well but one sprayer doesn&#x27;t last long!  I suggest that the company have bigger containers that would last longer.</li>
    <li> I have a real problem with dry mouth, not only because of my meds, but because I sleep with my mouth open.  This helps more than anything else I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> This has helped for my medication-related dry mouth. It doesn&#x27;t last hours or anything but it does work and doesn&#x27;t taste like medicine or have an aftertaste. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using the tablets and thought this would be good for on the go. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m doing something wrong but the spray doesn&#x27;t. It is more of a heavy dribble that runs down your throat. I have dry mouth  not dry stomach. I hope to get it to work before I waste it all in the effort.</li>
    <li> This is best oral moisturizer out there.</li>
    <li> Nice refreshing spray..</li>
    <li> [Oasis Dry Mouth Moisturizing spray] It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried. After I decided to get a mouth moisturizer, I unsuccessfully looked for a spray in the other, highly advertised brand. My pharmacist mentioned that they had a gel in that brand and I bought that,  A couple days later, I found these &#x27;pocket size&#x27; Oasis sprays on Amazon and although I wasn&#x27;t familiar with the Oasis brand, I purchased a package of 2 for comparison to the one I already had.. The spray is more convenient, as expected. More importantly, it works better than the gel for me. And it it tastes better. There are other brands that I haven&#x27;t tried but I&#x27;ll stick with this. It gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Because of medicines I take, my mouth is always painfully dry.  I keep some Oasis with me all the time -- a small bottle in my purse (and even in bed with me at night) and a larger bottle in the bathroom.  It is effective and has a pleasant mint taste.</li>
    <li> About the only good thing is the taste.  It helps dry mouths for less than 10 seconds.</li>
    <li> I used to use a different brand dry mouth spray, but then I could find that anywhere - even online sources said it was out of stock. So I tried Oasis. FANTASTIC!  I like the taste even better than my old brand and it works better too in keeping my mouth &amp; throat moist. And I *love* this small purse size!!  Even if the other brand comes back, I&#x27;m staying with Oasis. It works &amp; tastes great.</li>
    <li> Very helpful and perfect size!  Carry one in my purse and have one at home.</li>
    <li> These containers hold so little and last only a very short time!  The pump also malfunctions very easily.&lt;br /&gt;Spray tastes good--a plus.  Just okay!</li>
    <li> I did not care for the taste.</li>
    <li> It works!!!  There&#x27;s another brand on the market that tastes downright nasty, but Oasis is pleasant and refreshes your mouth when that awful dryness strikes.  Some medications cause dry mouth and it is terribly uncomfortable.  I always use a few squirts of Oasis before retiring for the night, and it helps me fall asleep without the dry mouth causing difficulty relaxing.</li>
    <li> kept mouth feeling fresh and moist thank you</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Who knew cancer treatment left you with dry mouth? But I have to say I like this better than the stuff my dentist recommended.</li>
    <li> Dry mouth is not a minor irritation.  To the contrary, the lack of moisture in your mouth can cause very serious problems, leading to the loss of teeth.  Saliva continuously cleans your teeth throughout the day and is necessary for good dental health.  My dentist recommended Oasis to me.  It works far better than Bentene gum, or toothpaste, and lasts longer, too.  I would, and have recommended it to family and friends. It works.</li>
    <li> This worked out well for my mom who is on oxygen and somewhat difficult to please.  A thumbs up from mom is worth ten stars!</li>
    <li> For the price this spray hardly lasted 2-3 weeks and I won&#x27;t reorder.</li>
