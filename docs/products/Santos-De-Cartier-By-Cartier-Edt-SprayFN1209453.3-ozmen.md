      <li>My boyfriend loves Cartier Santos, it has a nice scent and the price I paid on amazon was a great deal compared to the $95 in department stores.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied none-the-less.</li>
      <li>The package arrived early in perfect condition.</li>

      <li>I am completely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
      <li>Santos De Cartier has been my favorite cologne for perhaps twenty years.  </li>
      <li>and I still love it.  </li>
      <li>If you can imagine very RICH chocolate and baby powder scents on the beach...........yum</li>
      <li>and it is not always easy to find.</li>
      <li>i once wore it in the 80&#x27;s and still a very nice scent ..... and many of my female comment on its smell</li>
      <li>It is like pure water in a nice bottle.</li>
      <li>I hear Cartier has quit producing it but am fortunate we can still purchase it online.</li>
      <li>It makes my husband smell &amp;#34;rico&amp;#34; and the price is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>The scent of this perfume is good, soft and penetrating.</li>
      <li>and this is fast becoming my favorite of the three.</li>
      <li>Super  good, Cartier is my favorite mark, and low cost for this resseler,  </li>
      <li>I got this for my fianc&amp;eacute; for Hanukkah, it is by far my favorite cologne, and such an amazing deal!</li>
      <li>I would add, however, that as with many of these, perhaps an earlier formulation might&#x27;ve had a better reaction from me?</li>
      <li>soft fresh smell is very comfortable to use at any time.</li>
      <li>, Cartier is my favorite mark, and low cost for this resseler,</li>

      <li>I expected a better smell from Cartier , I used santos de Cartier in the past and it was much nicer and better smell</li>
      <li>The lady said she wasn&#x27;t aware of any changes and suggested that, instead of the eau de toilet (silver band), I needed the concentrate (gold band).  </li>
      <li>This is not a Original SANTOS De CARTIER, this is a cheap copy, do not buy.</li>
      <li>I must say, I was pleasantly surprised when I received it and would definitly recommend it to everyone.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is bold and alluring; Santos is not a sweet cologne.  </li>
      <li>A very rich, but subtle scent</li>
      <li>But as for my preferences, I can at least share that there are others in my collection of similar nature to this one but which are just... better, to me.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s subtle and women love the smell up close and personal.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised to find the scent was different, a hint of what I&#x27;ve come to know over the years.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Had not had this cologne for years and the reason was the cost of it in department stores. Product came as described, although next time I will purchase the actual liquid form and not the spray. Very satisfied none-the-less.</li>
    <li> The scent of this perfume is good, soft and penetrating. Collect dr conditions according to the quality of Cartier.&lt;br /&gt;Her soft fresh smell is very comfortable to use at any time.</li>
    <li> A Father;s Day gift. He loves this cologne.</li>
    <li> This the worst item I have ever bought from Amazon. It is like pure water in a nice bottle. Till now, I rely on items from Amazon. Think over Santos De Cartier before wasting your money.</li>

    <li> It makes my husband smell &amp;#34;rico&amp;#34; and the price is fantastic.  A very rich, but subtle scent; the effect reminds me of the women&#x27;s fragrance, Angel.  If you can imagine very RICH chocolate and baby powder scents on the beach...........yum</li>

    <li> I have been getting this cologne for about 25 years and I still love it.  You need just a small spray and it will be noticed.  Thank you Cartier for continuing to make Santos!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cartier for years.  It&#x27;s subtle and women love the smell up close and personal.  I buy two at a time, one for home and one for travel.</li>
    <li> Every guy should try this!</li>
    <li> Santos De Cartier has been my favorite cologne for perhaps twenty years.  I can&#x27;t remember when I didn&#x27;t wear Santos.  The fragrance is bold and alluring; Santos is not a sweet cologne.  Further, it should be used sparingly, I found it to be the perfect complement to a tango embrace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received my order I was surprised to find the scent was different, a hint of what I&#x27;ve come to know over the years.  The scent was so different that I called the cosmetics department at Macy&#x27;s and asked if they knew if the formula had changed.  The lady said she wasn&#x27;t aware of any changes and suggested that, instead of the eau de toilet (silver band), I needed the concentrate (gold band).  With that in mind, I gave the eau de toilet to a friend and ordered the concentrate from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the Santos concentrate arrived I knew immediately this was not my fragrance.  It&#x27;s a diluted version of the scent.  Like I said, the cologne&#x27;s power lies in the fact that only a hint is required.  I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;ve done to Santos De Cartier but this experience has left me very disappointed.</li>
