### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The product is excellent for men or women with thinning hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great at preventing my hair from falling out.  </li>
      <li>I was happy that I received my package a lot faster than they said.</li>
      <li>and I think it is a good product.  </li>
      <li>For wife, she said good shampoo</li>
      <li>The product is good, I have been using this for quite a while.</li>
      <li>Good shampoo and conditioner</li>
      <li>Anyway i would rate the product as good.</li>
      <li>Treatment system is good</li>
      <li>The conditioner is good, as well as the shampoo.</li>
      <li>my hair feels so good and clean.  </li>
      <li>I also wasn&#x27;t sure if any of the product had been removed from the bottles.</li>
      <li>I noticed the hair falling out and the increasing visibility of my scalp a lot more.  </li>
      <li>Now i wonder whether material inside these items are original or some kind of c$%#.     </li>
      <li>Most importantly, my hair looks thicker and fuller.  </li>
      <li>So, when the product came out of the original box, I wasn&#x27;t sure if the product looked/smelled the way it was supposed to or if it was diluted or not.</li>
      <li>The system arrived in a timely manner and it was easy to unpack.</li>
      <li>I received my order in very quick time and was accurate.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in the hair loss yet</li>
      <li>but after 2 weeks of that I realized what a huge commitment it is and just couldn&#x27;t commit at that level.  </li>
      <li>Clean light fragrance (I can&#x27;t stand perfumy things--give me headached)that leaves hair feeling cleaned and lightly conditioned.</li>
      <li>I have seen a significant reduction in hair loss while I&#x27;m washing my hair.</li>
      <li>Seller ships quickly and</li>
      <li>My hair feels fuller and thicker especially on top of my head where it is thin.  </li>
      <li>(I have a ton of straight, normal hair--blondes not only have more fun, we also have more hair).</li>
      <li>This was my first time using this system in the Nioxin Starter Kit, so I had never seen what color it is or how it smells.</li>
      <li>I had used the first two systems years ago and had no idea there was a system 5.</li>
      <li>more, wash out the color of my hair to medium brown,  dye my hair again after 4 weeks, 2nd week the color wash to medium brown (with 6 washes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
      <li>but I think the stuff you work in and leave in your hair keeps it from falling out as much as it would otherwise.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast.</li>
      <li>I started using Nioxin system 5 and really like the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I never write product reviews, but this really works.  </li>
      <li>the cost is very reasonable compared to my local salon.</li>
      <li>After following the directions on this product and using it for roughly six to eight months I didn&#x27;t really notice too much of a change in my hair.</li>
      <li>This product is actually for chemically treated hair and not for natural hair as described AND pictured here.  </li>
      <li>With Nioxin I barely see 4-5 hair fall out.</li>
      <li>The scalp therapy (little brown container) burned my forehead for the first couple of days, until I got used to it.</li>
      <li>I am aware that it will take longer than a few washes to notice the difference</li>

    <li> This product is actually for chemically treated hair and not for natural hair as described AND pictured here.  Too much trouble to return it.</li>
    <li> I was happy that I received my package a lot faster than they said. My hair problem hasn&#x27;t stopped or slown down. So I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Hair loss runs on my mother&#x27;s side of the family.  After I turned 30 I noticed the hair falling out and the increasing visibility of my scalp a lot more.  I was told by a dermatologist I can start Rogaine but after 2 weeks of that I realized what a huge commitment it is and just couldn&#x27;t commit at that level.  I started using Nioxin system 5 and really like the shampoo and conditioner.  The leave treatment is simple also and overall the system is not a huge commitment.  I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in the hair loss yet but I have only been using it for a couple of months now.  I am aware that it will take longer than a few washes to notice the difference so I am still hopeful.  My husband says he notices a difference so we will see...</li>
    <li> The conditioner is good, as well as the shampoo. The scalp therapy (little brown container) burned my forehead for the first couple of days, until I got used to it. I have actually been losing some hair since I started using this product. I know they say that its supposed to come back in a couple of months. The scalp therapy dries your hair out as well. You might want to skip using that.</li>
    <li> I went on Nioxin.com where there is a little survey that helps you know what system to use. I had used the first two systems years ago and had no idea there was a system 5. This and the follicle booster seemed to stop my hair loss, although I did add silica to my diet as well. Clean light fragrance (I can&#x27;t stand perfumy things--give me headached)that leaves hair feeling cleaned and lightly conditioned. Oh, and I was losing A LOT of hair--all over floor and handfuls when I was washing it which gave a bit of a freak-out moment for several months of trying other things (and ruling out thyroid condition which I had before with this problem) until I rembered this product. My hair seems to be coming back in well at the temples where it seemed very thin (I have a ton of straight, normal hair--blondes not only have more fun, we also have more hair).</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 3 weeks now. I have seen a significant reduction in hair loss while I&#x27;m washing my hair. Previously i used to lose a lot of hair while I rinsed out my shampoo and conditioner in the shower. With Nioxin I barely see 4-5 hair fall out. There isn&#x27;t much hair loss once my hair has dried either.  The shampoo does not lather as much as other shampoos, but that does not bother me.  I suppose I have to wait another month or so to see if my hair actually get thicker though.</li>
    <li> The product is good, I have been using this for quite a while. This time i brought this from payless beauty for less price. The items arrived on time but all the items were already open&#x27;d and they are sealed by using a white tape. Now i wonder whether material inside these items are original or some kind of c$%#.     Anyway i would rate the product as good. but it from a different seller.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using this system in the Nioxin Starter Kit, so I had never seen what color it is or how it smells. So, when the product came out of the original box, I wasn&#x27;t sure if the product looked/smelled the way it was supposed to or if it was diluted or not. I also wasn&#x27;t sure if any of the product had been removed from the bottles.</li>
    <li> I have used Nioxin for years this product does eactly what it advertised.  My hair feels fuller and thicker especially on top of my head where it is thin.  Everytime I shampoo with this product my hair feels so good and clean.  I will recommend this product to anyone who is looking for fuller hair.</li>
    <li> I got this because my hair started falling out big time when I started nursing.  It&#x27;s great at preventing my hair from falling out.  I&#x27;ve used it for 3 weeks and already see less scalp and I see lots of new hair growing, but the bottles are very small for the price.</li>
    <li> As a swim instructor, I am in the pool daily and as a consequence my hair was really dry, thin and falling out in clumps. Since I began using this product only a few weeks ago I noticed that it not only feels thicker but it falls out less and feels alot healthier.</li>
    <li> The product helped my hair grow back from chemo.  Would encourage others to use who have thinning hair or have and hair loss due to chemo to try this product..</li>
    <li> Shipped fast. For wife, she said good shampoo</li>
    <li> Helped me keep my hair during interferon treatment.</li>
    <li> It seems to leave my white hair shiny without any yellow tinge.  However, although I ordered Nioxin for chemically untreated hair, they shipped Nioxin system for treated hair.  I didn&#x27;t try to ship it back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this level of Nioxin for 7 months and have noticed a definite sowdown in the loss of my hair. My scalp feels cleaner than ever before.</li>
    <li> Treatment system is good and I think it is a good product.  The system arrived in a timely manner and it was easy to unpack.</li>
    <li> After following the directions on this product and using it for roughly six to eight months I didn&#x27;t really notice too much of a change in my hair. I did have some other male related side effects that my physician identified as a potential reaction to one of the active ingredients in the product.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo and conditioner but I think the stuff you work in and leave in your hair keeps it from falling out as much as it would otherwise.</li>
    <li> I have dark brown/black (asian medium coarse) hair, #5 is not working for me.&lt;br /&gt;Using for 2 and 1/2 months now, day by day, Pray to slow down loosing hair soon (try to be patient), but is not working for asian hair.&lt;br /&gt;So disappointed, not about wasted money, wasted my time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Email to Nioxin website for question, there is no respond, back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more, wash out the color of my hair to medium brown,  dye my hair again after 4 weeks, 2nd week the color wash to medium brown (with 6 washes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B005F1ITI4 Nioxin System KIT 5: Cleanser 10.1 oz, Therapy 5.1 oz, Treatment 3.4 oz]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone has any idea, please post.</li>
    <li> I never write product reviews, but this really works.  My hair began to thin significantly a few months ago and my aunt recommended this to me.  I&#x27;ve used it for about three weeks now and while my hair is not growing back, I am not losing hair the way I was.  Most importantly, my hair looks thicker and fuller.  I understand this may not work for everyone, but you should definitely give it a try.  Seller ships quickly and the cost is very reasonable compared to my local salon.</li>
    <li> I received my order in very quick time and was accurate. The product is excellent for men or women with thinning hair. I have used it for over 10 years and it has slowed my thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
