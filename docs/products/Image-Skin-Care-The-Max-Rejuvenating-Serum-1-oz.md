      <li>First of all let me tell you that my mother is the cellulite Queen...</li>

      <li>Oh I almost forgot to mention my muffin top and inner thighs have some noticable problems to.</li>

      <li>This product gives me a pretty glow on my skin.</li>

      <li>It is very moisturizing as well,so you don&#x27;t need another product over it.  </li>

      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product for&lt;br /&gt;any one</li>

      <li>I think this serum may be old or something .  </li>
      <li>My skin really feels and looks younger!  </li>
      <li>Only 1oz goes fast.</li>
      <li>Keeps skin young and dewy.</li>
      <li>Absorbs into the skin quickly and only requires a single application each day.</li>
      <li>but I am not sure that the Max is any better than the Regular Image Serum.</li>
      <li>My skin is smooth, small wrinkles almost disappear.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and you only need a little.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to know how much I like it.  </li>

<li> am disappointed.</li>
<li> The bad reviews are regarding the pump, which is a piece of crap...but has nothing to do with the product efficacy!  </li>
<li> Very disappointing !!</li>

    <li> I have been using this product for years, its amazing. I will continue to use it and recommend it to friends</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to know how much I like it.  Want to see long term benefits</li>
    <li> My wife has been using it this serum for 8 months almost daily, and it still hasn&#x27;t finished. The fine lines have indeed been reduced. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> great product recommend by a friend and can&#x27;t live without it. I highly recommend this product for&lt;br /&gt;any one it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I first purchased this from a spa and paid much more for it there.  This is a great buy</li>
    <li> I like the product a lot. It was may dermatologist recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;Keep my skin looking very health and has a suave texture. Thumbs up.</li>
    <li> This product indeed reduces fine lines.  I would recommend it !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I previously purchased Image total anti-aging serum.  This didn&#x27;t work as well. But my complaint with this item, which states 1.7 oz, is that I do not believe it contained that amount.  It didn&#x27;t last long.  I have purchased this before at a beauty salon and used it for a long time.  Earlier I purchased travel size product and the 4 small jars were either dried out or not sealed so product leaked out.  I was  not charged.  I think this serum may be old or something .  I&#x27;ll be more careful purchasing items where product cannot be seen.  I won&#x27;t waste the money on this 1.7 bottle of serum again.  Very disappointing !!</li>
    <li> Works great on keeping crows feet lines around the eyes to a minimum.  Absorbs into the skin quickly and only requires a single application each day.</li>
    <li> I love this product but the shipping package was terrible. I&#x27;m surprised it wasn&#x27;t broken during shipping.</li>
    <li> I like the Image Skin Care line (I usually use the Vital C) and wanted to try this for my neck.  It works pretty well but I can&#x27;t stand the smell.  It&#x27;s not a bad smell...just too much perfume and fragrance.</li>
    <li> Haleluya folks!  This serum is probably the best product I have ever found!  No joke! My face looks great! The skin on my neck has tightened. I&#x27;m 49 and I really don&#x27;t look bad (in clothes), but this product is helping me stave off some of the effects of Father Time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I just purchased another bottle to use on my body...yes on my body. First of all let me tell you that my mother is the cellulite Queen...and I am the Princess. My upper arms are starting to look flabby, my upper thighs have a few pockets and well my butt could hold a small bucket of water in each cheek. Yeah, I know...gross. Well that&#x27;s the way it is or shall I say WAS. I have been using this serum on those areas and noticed a difference after the first use. Oh I almost forgot to mention my muffin top and inner thighs have some noticable problems to. Like a kind of wrinkling of the skin look. I use this product there also. Now I still have those problems, but the skin in those areas are getting noticably smoother so far. And that&#x27;s a good thing for me. I have only been using it on my body for maybe a week now and only once a day. Think what results I would get if I used it twice a day and incorporated some exercise? (I&#x27;m also a smoker...yeah I know...another gross). I also want to mention that I message my skin in circular and upward motions in the problem areas with a Cellulite Circulation Massage Brush to promote better circulation. I think this is important. All I can tell you is that it works for me and I&#x27;m really happy!</li>
    <li> My aesthetician recommended The MAX and uses it for facials. I have been using it for about 2 years and I use it the Image line. I can see a difference in the size of pores and the amount of lines on my face. It seems to tighten and tone. At 60 I need all the help I can get to look younger.</li>
    <li> I use the serum everyday. My eyes look great! I recommend the product to any one!! Love it! Will be buying more!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use The Max for a couple years now and love how it keeps my skin soft and smooth. It&#x27;s pricey though.</li>
    <li> The product pump did not work properly.  Since I was leaving town, I was stuck with it.  they did give me a 25% discount, but I still have a lot of trouble with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased this product locally and wonder if this is a &amp;#34;second&amp;#34; that did not meet the market standards.</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing.  It retails for over $90 at the aestetichan&#x27;s.  The bad reviews are regarding the pump, which is a piece of crap...but has nothing to do with the product efficacy!  If you are careful when you push down ....sloooowwwly...it is fine.  An extra 5 seconds. Whatever.  It has made my skin feel and look great! I am 49! buy it!</li>
    <li> This is all in one, Image has fantastic products! Not a bad one in the bunch!</li>
    <li> I love all the Image products they are the best I have used so far and I have used and tried a lot of face products!</li>
    <li> The pump is big mistake . When I press the dispenser,the cream spews forth in great amounts.&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product gives me a pretty glow on my skin. No other products leave my skin looking fresh. I just love them.</li>
    <li> Too early to tell about the results but the pump is horrible.  For the price of product, they certainly need to improve quality of the dispenser.</li>
    <li> This serum has made a huge difference in my skin! I have been using it for three months now and it has created a whole new texture to my skin. My skin really feels and looks younger!  I used this every day and then use the tinted moisturizer-what a great combination!  My skin just soaks up both! Will keep using this product!</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and you only need a little.  My aestheticism used this on me after a facial.  I like it better than the Philosophy serum.</li>
    <li> I did not give 5 stars because the pump doesn&#x27;t work perfectly, but if you push down on it very slowly, it dispenses ok. Plus, I just poured some into a sample container that I have from the spa where I first experienced The Max Serum, and that solved the pump issue. I love this stuff. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper than the Max creme - I guess because it&#x27;s thinner, but I think it works just as well. I really like the Image line, and I&#x27;m not one to buy into the expensive skin care products.</li>
    <li> Love the product! Only 1oz goes fast. Product is great for morning and evening use however if you did that it would be gone in two weeks.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year. I have noticed a visible difference in my skin, especially around my mouth and neck.  It is very moisturizing as well,so you don&#x27;t need another product over it.  I would highly recommend it for aging skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this daily  since I received it.  There may be a difference in my neck but nothing drastic.</li>
    <li> This goes a long way!  I use it at night and in the morning religiously!  It is worth every penny.  Keeps skin young and dewy.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for about seven weeks.  My skin feels much softer and the appearance has improved.  I&#x27;m sure it will only get better as time goes by.</li>
    <li> I have used Image Serum for years and think it is wonderful.  The Max Serum is more expensive and supposed to be better so I thought I would give it a try.  I love the feel of this Serum and although others have commented negatively on the pump I have had no issues.  So far I am very pleased but I am not sure that the Max is any better than the Regular Image Serum.</li>
    <li> Fountain of Youth in a small bottle. I have only found this brand in dermatologist and plastic surgery clinics so the price is WAY better here!</li>
