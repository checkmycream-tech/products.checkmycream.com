    <li> The stand does not hold all razors effectively, but it works, and the brush is of decent quality</li>
    <li> It was good while it lasted. P.S. it lasted 3 days.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my needs.  I threw away the razor and simply use the razor holder for my disposible razors.  Brush is fine.  Very practical and looks good.</li>
    <li> Good starter brush, stand is a plus, the razor is for not of good quality but its comes with the brush. Over all its fair for the price</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my guy 9 months ago for Christmas 12&#x27;. It lasted fairly well, with regular use till recently the brush handle came apart, but can be repaired/ glued easily. The heavyweight plastic it&#x27;s made of is fairly sturdy but nothing close to metal. For 25$ it has done the Job well as an \\&quot;on the counter set\\&quot;</li>
    <li> The brush hair has not been properly processed and stinks. The razor handle will not work with Mach 3 blade. Just another case of China made trash.</li>
    <li> Total piece of s***.  Razor didn&#x27;t even stay on the handle and the brush part fell off.  After the first use  Crap and waste of money  Do not buy it!</li>
    <li> Yes it&#x27;s Plastic, but it works just fine. It fits my Double edge razor perfect. I have several brushes and cant believe how soft this one is. I believe it will hold up if you take care of it. I though when it said Silver Badger Shaving Set they were talking about the set, but I believe this is a Silver tip Badger Brush. If not, it is really a great copy. As soon as I received this set I soak the brush for 5 min. and lathered up using my Proraso  soap and couldn&#x27;t believe how well it lathered.</li>
    <li> got this for my boyfriend, kinda disappointed at how cheap and plasticy it looks and feels. it feels like a kids toy. on the plus side the brush works good.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal for the price.  The set is really good looking and for the most part it&#x27;s of decent quality.  I&#x27;ve had quite a few of the bristles fall out over the couple of years that I&#x27;ve owned but it&#x27;s pretty minor. My only issue is that this is not very high quality (although I think it looks nice).  But for the price it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
    <li> - love the camel hair brush!&lt;br /&gt;I use this with a Lord double edge razor and it looks just fin in this stand.&lt;br /&gt;Nice product!</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time.  Poor quality... Brush is flimsy and razor button broke when I tried to attach the first blade cartridge.</li>
    <li> The stand and shave handle is just fine, but the shaving brush sucks.  I have many brushes to compare this one with and it fells more like a make-up brush, hair is to fine and holds no body when wet.</li>
    <li> The stand itself isn&#x27;t bad, and does the trick.  The brush didn&#x27;t last more than one use and fell apart...</li>
    <li> They are pretty light. But they look good.</li>
    <li> The item came in great shape.  Nothing broken or damaged.  The brush came apart within two weeks.  Am glueing the brush back into the handle, hoping it sticks.</li>
    <li> The razor stand arrived and it is nice and sturdy.  The brush and razor are nice looking.  Items arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> Pretty but brush fell apart did not use the razor. The stand left a rust mark on the counter. Would not reccomend</li>
    <li> I gave this to my boyfriend for Christmas and the brush was not glued on to the handle. I glued it myself and it has broken again 2 times. I keep gluing it.&lt;br /&gt;It is made of really cheap material.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the price. Fits nicely on my sink and generally no complaints whatsoever!</li>
    <li> This stand is fine for the razor but when I tried to hang my &amp;#34;better brush&amp;#34; which has fuller bristles it is too small.</li>
    <li> Great product, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but was pleasantly surprised, quality - good looking stand and a great legitimate brush</li>
    <li> I bought this as part of a Christmas gift for my husband but didn&#x27;t give him the handle&lt;br /&gt;because it felt like hollow plastic -the badger brush and the stand are ok though and&lt;br /&gt;2 yrs later he is still using them..hence the 4 stars! But beware of the handle, unless&lt;br /&gt;they have changed it, it is junk.</li>
    <li> I gave my sonas a gift this past Xmas. He loves it.</li>
    <li> 4 stars instead of 5 because it&#x27;s a little light-weight and plastic.  but inexpensive, so to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t intend to travel with it, so it won&#x27;t break -- maybe bring the brush separately &#x27;cause it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
