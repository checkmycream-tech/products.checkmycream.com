      <li>Lavoris has always been the favorite mouthwash in my family.  </li>
      <li>Lavoris has always been a favorite of mine but is not handled by store any more.  </li>
      <li>used to LOVE this mouthwash.</li>
      <li>I love cinnamon</li>
      <li>Learned to like this many years ago when my dentist gave a cup of it to rinse your mouth out with.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not medicine-y, and tastes like fireballs, but without the sugar, and no nasty aftertaste.  </li>
      <li>They taste more like Listerine.</li>

      <li>It may be OK for some who do not want a strong mouthwash, but it is not for me.</li>

      <li>If you are expecting the old great mouthwash you are accustomed to getting, make sure you get the old label, or you will be very surprised.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon !!</li>
      <li>And no it does not leave my breath fresh for hours.</li>
      <li>It gives you all day fresh breath.</li>
      <li>I buy this product just to keep fresh breath.</li>
      <li>fresh without alcohol in the morning</li>
      <li>Lavoris fits the bill; leaves my mouth fresh.</li>
      <li>All the recent reviews are right, it isn&#x27;t nearly as potent as it was before.</li>
      <li>Be warned, it is a hot cinnimon, but man</li>
      <li>The first four digits represent the year and month of manufacture; e.g., 1506 is June 2015.</li>
      <li>You used to be able to get it at the local grocer or drug store -- but no longer (since it was bought</li>
      <li>Would definitely keep buying this :)</li>
      <li>It has been likely 25 years or more</li>
      <li>I have been a fan of the hot cinnimon flavor ever since.  </li>
      <li>but be aware who you order from.  </li>
      <li>The zantrate really makes a difference!</li>
      <li>I only wish the price was more reasonable.</li>
      <li>Idk, I think I&#x27;m used to listening and this stuff doesn&#x27;t seem strong enough.</li>
      <li>I was very dissatisfied.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, Amazon took it back as a defective product and refunded my money.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t really care for this mouthwash.</li>
      <li>but the seller is really cheating you at this price.</li>
      <li>really wakes your mouth up.</li>
      <li>I apparently belong to the minority that does not like a minty taste for toothpaste or mouthwash because when I go to most stores, that&#x27;s pretty much the only choice.</li>
      <li>Fresh breath products that cost $20 a bottle don&#x27;t work anywhere near as well.</li>
      <li>I really like the cinnamon flavor.  </li>
      <li>I have used the product for years and like it so much that I tried to order it through you.  </li>
      <li>I think I like this mouthwash because in my early days many dentists used it after a treatment and the flavor is stimulating as well as bringing back memories.</li>
      <li>Maybe we can figure out when/if they decide to go back to the original potency.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t buy this until Lavoris decides to go back to the original formulation.</li>
      <li>The cinnamon flavor was much stronger in the older formulation.</li>
      <li>This keeps your breath fresh much-much longer than Listerine and Scope-almost the entire day.</li>
      <li>Although other brands and flavors are available just around the corner, I order this because it works, even on \\&quot;morning breath\\&quot;</li>
      <li>cant find it where i live but found it here on Amazon</li>
      <li>I checked the label and found it was a new label.</li>
      <li>I gave you my new address at the beginning of the transaction, and you still sent it to my old address and the new owner had to send it to me.  </li>
      <li>since I last had some, but it is the real deal.  </li>
      <li>Pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what we will do when the supply of the old formula runs out.</li>
      <li>We order this for my wife who swears by it and will have no other.  </li>
      <li>No other product I have tried comes close to this.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve looked long are far for this in stores everywhere.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve looked long are far for this in stores everywhere.</li>
<li> I think you could eat a whole raw onion and this stuff could hide it.  </li>
<li> and on the backside of the bottle about 3/4 the way up the bottle it says 1209/N263AC in black lettering on the plastic (kind of difficult</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t find it in any physical store anymore, but as long as Amazon carries it</li>
<li> It actually left a poor taste in my mouth instead of giving me fresh breath.</li>
<li> the large bottles are hard to find.  </li>
<li> and I&#x27;m certainly not a kid any longer by a long shot.  </li>
<li> Love this product, and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to come by.</li>
<li> Normally, I love Lavoris, and have had no problem with this product in the past  ~ but this last order, from this vender, was bad, and I had to pour it down</li>
<li> I feel bad throwing it away because it is such a large bottle, so it is sitting on a shelf.</li>
<li> The cinnamon flavor was not very strong at all.  </li>
<li> dad used this everyday before he went to work.  </li>
<li> For some reason this product has gone by the wayside and In my opinion it&#x27;s the only mouthwash worth using and all the others that taste horrible should come off the shelf and put nothing but Lavoris up.</li>
<li> /&gt;Problem is, it&#x27;s really costly for me to ship it here to the Rep of Panama, but I do it anyway even though it strains the budget because I hate all the other brands.</li>
<li> I also had a gift card, and I am still not sure if you subtracted it or not.</li>
<li> Lavoris has become increasingly hard to find in the Northeast.  </li>
<li> The words claiming to have the least alcohol of any mouthwash have been removed.</li>
<li> I must point out, however, that it does contain alcohol which some say is not a good thing.</li>
<li> The last two bottles we bought were terrible.</li>
<li> Sorry Lavoris!</li>
<li> It has a cinammon taste and according to the label contains the stuff for killing bad breath.</li>
<li> oh man does it kick any bad breath away.  </li>
<li> The product that I received tasted terrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My husband and I like Lavoris and have used it for years. I only wish the price was more reasonable.</li>
    <li> I appreciate the efficienty in the handling of this order.  Lavoris has always been a favorite of mine but is not handled by store any more.  This is an easy and satisfying way of obtaining it.</li>
    <li> We have used Lavoris as the best mouthwash for many years. The last two bottles we bought were terrible. They taste more like Listerine. I checked the label and found it was a new label. The ingredients and the sequence had changed. The writing on the label has also changed. The words claiming to have the least alcohol of any mouthwash have been removed. Also, the address for the distributor in Wisconsin has also been removed. I have written several times to the company to find out about it, and they do not answer my requests for information.  If you are expecting the old great mouthwash you are accustomed to getting, make sure you get the old label, or you will be very surprised. I don&#x27;t know what we will do when the supply of the old formula runs out.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize they still made Lavoris and it still the same product.  It is a great mouthwash and keeps your breath fresh for hours.  Less alcohol allows a more pleasant taste without loosing the effectiveness.</li>
    <li> This keeps your breath fresh much-much longer than Listerine and Scope-almost the entire day. It will cure your dragon breath. It also helps mitigate or eliminate morning breath. No other product I have tried comes close to this. I buy this product just to keep fresh breath. Fresh breath products that cost $20 a bottle don&#x27;t work anywhere near as well.</li>
    <li> I determined that Lavoris Cinnamon was the best mouthwash over 30 years ago.  I was happy to find it again.  Guess what?  It is still the best.</li>
    <li> Lavoris has always been the favorite mouthwash in my family.  I was pleased to order the large 32 oz. size, as it goes quickly, and the large bottles are hard to find.  This was ordered as a Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> One of the most pleasant tasting mouthwashes I have ever used, and it does what it advertises, keeps your breath fresh.  Would definitely keep buying this :)</li>
    <li> I apparently belong to the minority that does not like a minty taste for toothpaste or mouthwash because when I go to most stores, that&#x27;s pretty much the only choice. That&#x27;s why I recommend Lavoris. It has a cinammon taste and according to the label contains the stuff for killing bad breath. Nuff said!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why Lavoris disappeared from local stores. It is the only mouthwash I will use -- having used it for decades. The other stuff, which takes up an incredible amount of shelf space, is unpalatable.</li>
    <li> The product that I received tasted terrible. Fortunately, Amazon took it back as a defective product and refunded my money. But here is what you need to know. Printed on the back of the bottle is a series of numbers and letters. I think I have decoded them. The first four digits represent the year and month of manufacture; e.g., 1506 is June 2015. The bottles Amazon sent me were over a year old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Lavoris is a perishable. You wouldn&#x27;t go to a grocery store to buy a perishable without checking the date on the carton. Don&#x27;t turn this job over to a stock picker who isn&#x27;t going to do it for you.</li>
    <li> Lavoris has become increasingly hard to find in the Northeast.  You used to be able to get it at the local grocer or drug store -- but no longer (since it was bought -out).  Everything on the local shelves is MINT -- this is a nice, old-fashioned alternative.  I just wish it was easier to find.</li>
    <li> Lavoris is the only mouthwash that doesn&#x27;t taste like medicine to me.</li>
    <li> I like it because the cinnamon taste is pleasant, and all the others I have tried are much too stongly mint flavored.</li>
    <li> My Dad used this stuff and hence I started using it.  I have been a fan of the hot cinnimon flavor ever since.  It has been likely 25 years or more since I last had some, but it is the real deal.  Just as I remember it.  Be warned, it is a hot cinnimon, but man oh man does it kick any bad breath away.  I think you could eat a whole raw onion and this stuff could hide it.  I don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t find it in any physical store anymore, but as long as Amazon carries it I guess I am good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lavoris for 75 years!!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for an explosive cinnamon mouthwash, but this was not it. It tastes like it is diluted with water. It actually left a poor taste in my mouth instead of giving me fresh breath. I feel bad throwing it away because it is such a large bottle, so it is sitting on a shelf. It may be OK for some who do not want a strong mouthwash, but it is not for me. Sorry Lavoris! By the way, I love ordering from Amazon and will continue. This was just not the product I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This is the best mouthwash I have ever used.  Although other brands and flavors are available just around the corner, I order this because it works, even on \\&quot;morning breath\\&quot; just like it says.  It also doesn&#x27;t give you a medicine mouth.  It is the only one I like.  The zantrate really makes a difference!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the price and quality of this sized Lavoris. I will definitely buy it again IN THE FUTURE.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve looked long are far for this in stores everywhere. And it&#x27;s just as I remembered. I like it so I use it more often.</li>
    <li> Normally, I love Lavoris, and have had no problem with this product in the past  ~ but this last order, from this vender, was bad, and I had to pour it down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame too, as I can&#x27;t get this product locally and must order it online....!</li>
    <li> I have used Livoris Mouthwash for years and for some reason every store here quit handling it.I found it on Amazon and ordered it from them and always will.I also found that Lavoris Mouth wash will cure tonsiitis when gargled.Wouldn&#x27;t do without it.Thanks Amazon !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a cinnamon mouthwash before. I love cinnamon but I don&#x27;t really care for this mouthwash. Idk, I think I&#x27;m used to listening and this stuff doesn&#x27;t seem strong enough. And no it does not leave my breath fresh for hours.</li>
    <li> We order this for my wife who swears by it and will have no other.  I must point out, however, that it does contain alcohol which some say is not a good thing.</li>
    <li> The cinnamon flavor was not very strong at all.  Was not the way it was years back.  I was looking forward to the &amp;#34;nip&amp;#34; of the cinnamon but it didn&#x27;t happen.  Didn&#x27;t feel like I had rinsed my mouth.</li>
    <li> I just bought a bottle of Lavoris and the formula has definitely changed. All the recent reviews are right, it isn&#x27;t nearly as potent as it was before. The cinnamon flavor was much stronger in the older formulation. It doesn&#x27;t seem like the same mouthwash anymore. Don&#x27;t buy this until Lavoris decides to go back to the original formulation. It just isn&#x27;t as effective as it was before (the formulation I tried two years ago).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to LOVE this mouthwash. Now it&#x27;s well below average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle says: \\&quot;Distributed By Greenbrier International, INC Chesapeake, VA 23320\\&quot; .... \\&quot;MADE IN CANADA\\&quot;... SKU: 10667 ... UPC Code: 870929003501 ... and on the backside of the bottle about 3/4 the way up the bottle it says 1209/N263AC in black lettering on the plastic (kind of difficult to see).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that info helps. Maybe we can figure out when/if they decide to go back to the original potency.</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised. I thought Lavoris was out of business.  I like anything with a Cinammon flavor.</li>
    <li> I really like the cinnamon flavor.  Learned to like this many years ago when my dentist gave a cup of it to rinse your mouth out with.</li>
    <li> I have used Lavoris since I was a kid and I&#x27;m certainly not a kid any longer by a long shot.  For some reason this product has gone by the wayside and In my opinion it&#x27;s the only mouthwash worth using and all the others that taste horrible should come off the shelf and put nothing but Lavoris up. ;o)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem is, it&#x27;s really costly for me to ship it here to the Rep of Panama, but I do it anyway even though it strains the budget because I hate all the other brands.</li>
    <li> Lavoris mouthwash is great.  have used it for years.  but be aware who you order from.  i thought by the price that it was a box of 4 bottles for  $13.25 but it turned out to be for 1 bottle.  my fault for not checking closer but the seller is really cheating you at this price.</li>
    <li> Love this product, and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to come by.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of mint, and for some reason, almost all oral care products are mint flavored.  I love the taste of this mouthwash!  It&#x27;s not medicine-y, and tastes like fireballs, but without the sugar, and no nasty aftertaste.  I no longer dread using mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Nothing is like Lavoris. It has great cinnamon taste really wakes your mouth up. It gives you all day fresh breath.</li>
    <li> I think I like this mouthwash because in my early days many dentists used it after a treatment and the flavor is stimulating as well as bringing back memories.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so difficult to find cinnamon flavored mouthwash that&#x27;s more than just candy flavored water. Lavoris fits the bill; leaves my mouth fresh.</li>
    <li> Always dose a good job !</li>
    <li> I gave you my new address at the beginning of the transaction, and you still sent it to my old address and the new owner had to send it to me.  I have used the product for years and like it so much that I tried to order it through you.  I was very dissatisfied. I also had a gift card, and I am still not sure if you subtracted it or not.</li>
    <li> cant find it where i live but found it here on Amazon i used it years ago and loved the flavor</li>
    <li> fresh without alcohol in the morning</li>
    <li> Love this mouthwash!  It tastes good while it is taking care of my teeth, and I use it every day.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this mouthwash!  So glad I found it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;My dad used this everyday before he went to work.  I&#x27;ll never forget&lt;br /&gt;the scent of those kisses he&#x27;d give me before leaving!</li>
