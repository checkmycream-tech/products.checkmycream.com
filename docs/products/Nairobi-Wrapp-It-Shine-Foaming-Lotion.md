<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nice, light weight product.&lt;br /&gt;Will be in my cabinet for now on!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this foam wrap lotion regularly for a while now. It dries almost quicker than any other lotion I have used. Have been happy for the most part!</li>
    <li> I need to purchase this product by the keg.  It&#x27;s soften and holds my hair (that is very short) without any product build up.  It&#x27;s definitely a staple in my grooming kit for the summer!</li>
    <li> Product was exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  It leaves my hair with a healthy shine when I sit under the dryer and its doesn&#x27;t harden your hair!</li>
    <li> My hairstylist in connecticut used this on my hair (and I&#x27;ve purchased several bottles from her for home use) and I thought it was the best thing ever!  I specifically liked the thickness of the lotion and hold it gave; almost like it had gel in it for my short wrapped style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I moved to Orlando and decided to buy it from here...it was definitely not the product I grew to love.  It is watered down even after shaking it a dozen times and it doesn&#x27;t have the hold I&#x27;m used to.  I&#x27;m stuck with a bottle I can&#x27;t use.  I&#x27;m going to see if my hairstylist can send me a few bottles at least I know it will be what I&#x27;m use to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unhappy first customer!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the seller, package arrived quickly and in very good condition. Would recommend this seller A+++.  I have been using the wrapp-it shine foaming lotion for a long time, it gives great body, bounce &amp; shine.&lt;br /&gt;Smells terrific!</li>
    <li> Very fast and a VERY good product! it doesn&#x27;t dry out the hair. I love it and I live the fast service! THANKS!</li>
    <li> Repeat purchase. The best I have found, the store brands do not deliver like the Nairobi!  I wear a short pixie style similar to the old Halle Barry hairstyle. My salon uses this on its clients.</li>
    <li> Love Nairobi Wrapp-it because it provides a firm hold and it is not flaky after I dry my hair.</li>
    <li> I dont ever leave reviews, but i just had to today!! I washed and set my hair last night! Wow my curls have lasted the entire day! I have so much body. My hair is soft and it&#x27;s not weighed down! I have tried so many products over the years. I finally got that salon look by doing my hair myself! I will be purchasing more! So stop wasting money on other products and spend a few more bucks on this one. It&#x27;s worth every dollar! You can&#x27;t go wrong! Trust me.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a plethora of brands of wrap foam and none of them come remotely close to being as great as this! Works on wet or dry hair with a result of pure softness!</li>
    <li> This is a really great product. I relaxed my hair, then combed the wrapping lotion through. Then wrapped my hair and went to sleep. I got up early just in case my hair was goin to give me trouble. I was very surprised when I unwrapped my hair. I combed through it and my hair felt like there was nothing in it and was easy to move around. I was going for the Halle Berry spiky pixie look so i added pomade to my hair to spike it a bit. I love the look this wrapping lotion helped me create. Ordering 2 more bottles tomorrow, so I don&#x27;t run out. Get it, try it, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> For some reason this produt worked nothing like it did in the past when I purchased it from an actual beauty supply store.  After washing and conditioning my hair, I applied the wrap lotion and wrapped my hair as usual but when my hair dried it was hard, limp and brittle.  I will not be purchasing this item again(at least not online).</li>
    <li> This is the best foaming wrap I have ever used. I am a licensed stylist for over 10+ years &amp; this works great on any hair type. It actually does what it says.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Makes the hair shine, I don&#x27;t have to use much of it and it is true about no flaking.</li>
    <li> love this! will buy over and over again!</li>
    <li> Makes ure hait so soft n manageable.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after going to two salons that used the same product on my hair.  I finally pried the name of the product out of the second salon and went to work locating the product at a reasonable price.  The product gives my hair a smooth lustrous finish and feel.  It makes my curls last longer and fuller.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product, hydrating, makes your hair look great. I don&#x27;t use it for wrapping, I simply use it after washing and conditioning and either blow dry or let my hair dry naturally.</li>
    <li> Nairobi--amazing product. Not sticky, no white buildup  and my hair has remained soft even after 4 days of use.</li>
    <li> Love it, transitioning from relaxed to natural.  I washed and conditioned my hair then wrapped it and let it air dry.  In the morning I flat ironed my hair and its silky and healthy, I love the results.  Will definitely recommend to others and will continue to use Nairobi Wrap lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this product makes my curls soft and shiny!!!! Best foam Ive ever used</li>
    <li> My daughter used this product on my hair at the salon and the shine to my hair was great!  So glad I was able to purchase it on line.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for a long time. Very good on African American hair. No alcohol and does not flake or give a super stiff set like some mousse have been known to do. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My stylist uses this product on my hair when I get a roller wrap. With the amount of product that she used, I was sure that my hair would turn out crisp and flaky.. I was so wrong, This foam left my hair soft, shiny and with lots of body! My wrap style lasted between salon visits, and even helped to reduce breakage!! I wanted to test this product at home to see if I will get the same results. I would say that compared to other foams that my other stylists used, and the foams that I have used at home, the Nairobi Wrapp-It Shine Foaming Lotion surpasses them all!! I would recommend this product to professionals as well as kitchen beauticians!!</li>
    <li> Great product! Leaves hair soft and moisturized yet with curl holding power!</li>
    <li> The worst quality Nairobi foam wrap I have ever used. I am not sure the product is even authentic it was so terrible. I usually purchase from salons and I have never had a bad use with them, however after this purchase my hair was sticky and extra dry and flaking which it states it isn&#x27;t suppose to do. I would not recommend buying this product online only from a professional stylist where authenticity is guaranteed. A wast of money more than half the product I haven&#x27;t even used because of the consistent disappointment after purchase.</li>
    <li> The best wrap lotion out there. I don&#x27;t purchase anything else ever.</li>
    <li> Helps control frizzy hair</li>
    <li> Came as stated was also double wrapped so.it does not spill.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product! My hairstylist used Nairobi Wrap &amp; Shine on my permed hair for wraps. And now that I&#x27;m natural I still use it! It&#x27;s great for wet sets and \\&quot;finger\\&quot; curls (when you twist or twirl your natural hair to hold a curl pattern). I put it on my hair while damp. At first your hair will look white from the foam but when it drys clear...Oh it will be shiny and bouncy!  I love it because it holds my natural curl without making it feel stiff, it&#x27;s lite, and it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of perfume or alcohol in it like some curling products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used a little bit once, but it seems fine.  I really don&#x27;t use a lot of product, but a friend uses this, so I tried.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!!!! Very satisfied with the end results no sticky crunchy film on hair smooth shine results</li>
    <li> Excellent sums it up!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this wrap! It holds the mold in place and hair is soft and Shiney after drying.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter, it is the one her hairdresser uses and she loves it.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist introduced me to this.&lt;br /&gt;I like it very much.</li>
    <li> I stated using this product a few years ago when I noticed that my stylist used it. I love it, it leaves my hair soft and manageable. I will most def continue to use this product and buy again!</li>
    <li> Best setting foam ever #1</li>
    <li> the beeeeest 😻 exspecially for short , stubborn and hard to blend leave out !</li>
    <li> Great product with multiple utility!</li>
    <li> This setting lotion is excellent, it leaves your hair feeling soft and shinny. I use to use lottabody but now I will never use anything else but Narobi!! Thanks for making a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product I love it . I have been using this product for 3 years now it&#x27;s makes my hair so soft and silky</li>
    <li> Love this product and would highly recommend it for a polished finish to your style</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!! I&#x27;m a Black women whom loves her short hair!! This product is the best I&#x27;ve tried using the molding technique. ..when combined w/the shampoo &amp; Conditioner it produces beautiful hair! But even using the form after you wash w/your perferred brand of shampoo your hair still combs out smooth &amp; silky shining....great product! Worth every penny!! Happy Hair Styling....</li>
    <li> It appeared to be watered down, I have purchased others that were much thicker. I have purchased from other sellers and did not have this issue</li>
    <li> My stylist uses this, but my hair requires setting more often that I want to go or afford to sit in anybody&#x27;s salon.  It really is a good hold without buildup.</li>
    <li> Best foam wrap I&#x27;ve ever tried! Leaves my hair shiny and light. After it dries it doesn&#x27;t flake and have a sticky film like some of the others I have tried.</li>
    <li> The Nairobi Wrapp-it foam made my hair (natural/ no more perms)very soft, bouncy and easy to comb.  I also used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair and her curls came out so pretty.  I really like this product.</li>
    <li> The item arrived ahead of time and works great! It is good for smoothing natural hair after wash, making it easier to comb thru.</li>
    <li> It dries quickly. My hair shines and it feels so soft. The product is light and does not weight my hair down. I can use it every day if I need to. I will definitely buy another bottle when this one runs out.</li>
    <li> I hate this product. If your going to buy this PLEASE by from the company. When I put this product on my head it smelled like rat poisoning &amp; burned my scalp so bad. Then I read on the back of the bottle Nairobi cannot grantee the authenticity of this product if sold by someone other than them. I shop on Amazon daily &amp; I will never buy hair products again.</li>
    <li> Great Product for natural hair, dries fast, no residue or flaking. Priced less than local beauty supply stores. Arrived on time, not damaged. Yes, I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Just what I was looking for to get that salon look at home...:-)</li>
    <li> Love this stuff for setting short african american hair before sitting under dryer and styling. It smooths out unruly hair and leaves hair soft, shiny, voluminous.</li>
    <li> Great for molding my course thick pixie cut down.</li>
    <li> Very good wrap lotion.  A little goes a long way and does not dry your hair out like other wrap lotions.</li>
    <li> Looking for a hair wrap where you do not have to sit under the dryer!  You&#x27;ve found it.  I just wrap and let dry and still same effect!  It doesn&#x27;t dry flakey or hard with or without sitting under the hair dryer!</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I needed to wrap my hair.  No flaking, pain free combing, and it cuts down the drying time.</li>
    <li> This is best foam in the world. Doesn&#x27;t make your crunchy but holds it in place! Love it!</li>
    <li> This product leave your hair with a great shine. My hair layed flat, when I need it to. When I curled it the curls held great.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff. Leaves your wrap soft and smooth, has a firm hold but doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard &amp; crunchy nor does it give you flakes!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I was introduced by my stylist. It says that it&#x27;s for relaxed but it works like a champ on my natural THICK hair and my twist outs come out amazing and last days on end. Very impressed.</li>
    <li> This product is watered down.</li>
    <li> This is a good hair product for my African American wavy natural style.  There is no flaking.  It&#x27;s a bother to order on line and I don&#x27;t think it is necessarily better than a product I can find locally.</li>
    <li> Even having grown out my relaxer and wearing my hair natural now, this is still the best foam for when I&#x27;m setting my hair.  I use the Vakind Curlformers and my curls are so incredibly soft, and I apply it on my hair when it&#x27;s dry instead of wet.  No other foam compares, but if you try the other Nairobi products, I&#x27;m sure you will like them too.  They are a great line for hair products.</li>
    <li> My choice for the past 8 years. I use this product immediately after washing to add control and body to my hair. This is a wonderful product as is the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Love this product, received it in a timely matter!</li>
    <li> My hair is natural and this stuff is great.  I love the way it makes it feel not sticky.  It is not hard. It looks like I just left the salon.</li>
    <li> I bought this and told myself I was going to try and style my own hair and save some money. I am black and have a halle berry pixie hair cut style. I use this and my hair came out straight and soft. I normally use a cheaper wrap lotion and my hair doesn&#x27;t come out right. I sat under the dryer and styled my hair and it came out great, my hair was soft and shiny. Recommend this product. No more cheap wrap lotion from target or Sally&#x27;s Beauty.</li>
    <li> makes hair soft and set lasts for days.  Unlike most products when you use this your hairs holds but is soft.</li>
    <li> This product is very good. I used it when I roller set my hair. It gives the hold that I need but it is also moisturizing. I make my hair shiny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product so many times and I always get it on time! Love it. Go out and order it now.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It definitely leaves this hair soft, smooth, manageable, and with a nice shine. I give my hair a good wash and conditioner. Then I use the Nairobi Wrap and sit under hair dryer until hair dry. Lastly I curl my hair and I&#x27;m done. This a great, great product.</li>
    <li> Deliver was fast and prompt. However, this product did not straighten my hair as much as I thought it would, I, African American with 3c hair type. The back is short and the front is right above my shoulders. I washed, conditioned it, applied Nairobi, in great volume, to my hair, wrapped it with a fine tooth comb (ouch) before it dried, sat under the dryer for 45 min, then went to bed. In the morning my hair was curly and not so straight. Maybe I did something wrong.....I will try again, we&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> Spoke to the company about the ingredient listing on this product and had to run all over the web for a so called full ingredient listing!  Products should have a full disclosure.  Caveat for those companies who lack transparency when dealing with the general public is my advice.  Certainly will NOT buy again, nor have any consideration towards any new products or the product line in general.</li>
    <li> I saw some naturals were using this for there twist outs etc. I tried it for myself, it did not dry even though I let it set for a whole entire day. It did not set my style at all, no shine or definition. I don&#x27;t know if it needs heat to &amp;#34;activate &amp;#34; it but right now it&#x27;s just collecting dust. I do not know if this was a watered or tampered with version from this seller but based off the results I&#x27;ve seen and heard from others I was greatly disappointed.</li>
    <li> love love love this is the best yet, I highly recommend this product as it the best on the market for shiny hair and low mess-up when re-styling your hair</li>
    <li> I love it! I wear my hair natural and it was the best product I&#x27;ve ever used. It brought out my natural curl pattern and gave my hair shine. There was no heavy build-up or flaking. I love this product and  highly recommend everyone use it!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair hard like some other products. Would recommend to my friends or family. Great product and will buy again!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Conditions and helps with detangling and making hair more manageable.</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel too hard.  This product is not for &amp;#34;Mixed-Race thin hair people.  Made hair look like it was wet and felt dry.  I&#x27;ll have to give it a few more tries before my final verdict and at that time perhaps I can bump up the stars.  Chorine in the pools may be the problem.  Not ready to throw this product out yet.  Will up date.</li>
    <li> This product leaves hair soft without drying hair out. I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month and have noticed a change when styling hair. You only need a small amount to get good results, which makes this product worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I am a hairstylist, that swears by it. I&#x27;ve tried several foam wraps. Nairobi has a sleek soft feel. It&#x27;s not a watered down or high alcohol content styling aid. It&#x27;s consistency is just right. I&#x27;ve never experienced flakes from an excessive amount.</li>
    <li> This product works great on my natural hair. It dries without leaving any residue yet hair remains soft with a good hold. Would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great product! My stylist uses this on my hair at the salon.  I bought this for times when I&#x27;m unable to make my weekly appointment. No flaky and leaves it silk!!!</li>
    <li> Love this item!!!  This is the BEST foam wrap on the market!!</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot, and you will too. try it, you will like it/</li>
    <li> Its  what it says it is.  Very good product leaves hair shine, moist and looking great!</li>
    <li> I love the soft hold I get from Nairobi foaming lotion! Not too heavy and it doesn&#x27;t leave flakes, no matter how much product you use.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It keeps my hair soft and shinny. I normally have to order this product from a salon or distributor but via amazon was cheaper and faster.</li>
    <li> This setting and wrap lotion leaves your relaxed hair with a lot of shine, you do not have to add antything else. Great product. Unlike the other wrapping lotions make your hair hard and stiff, no matter how little you use.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product to wet wrap my short hair with that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair ultra dry with flaky residue. I&#x27;ve been using different wrap lotions like the Motions brand and some Eco Styler Gel and no matter what I use everything seems to leave my hair brittle with flakes. Nairobi, on the other hand, fit the bill. As soon as it was dry I noticed immediately how soft and shiny my hair is. I would&#x27;ve never expected these results with other products I have used in the past... And no flakey stuff when I comb through my hair.</li>
    <li> Works well on relaxed hair. Achieved a nice spiral hairdo when I roller set my hair on magnetic rollers and perm rods. Not too crunchy or dried out like with other setting lotions. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Best foam lotion ever!!  Leaves hair smooth, no flakes or resident when hair is dry.  I love how it leaves my hair full of body.</li>
    <li> Love the body this foam wrap leaves; plus it is firm enough for roller setting. I am happy to find a product that support my needs.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the shipping speed.  I think it provides a very soft hold when molding my hair, which I really liked.</li>
    <li> I love it! I don&#x27;t know what would do without it! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This helps my short hair do last for a week straight after i wash and set it, It is not sticky or flaky.</li>
    <li> Have used this stuff for years great for permed African American hair types , it does not leave residue and gives the hair a lot of body.</li>
    <li> I WILL DEFINITELY BE ORDERING IT AGAIN .IT LEAVES YOUR HAIR SO SOFT AND VERY EASY TO WRAP YOUR HAIR WITH LEAVING IT STRAIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL.</li>
    <li> I was using like 4 different products to style my hair before I tried this. I could never get the right balance of each to give a little hold but still be soft to the touch. I often use this with Flexi Rods but even on the days that I just wear my hair naturally I use this and it still gives good hold without being hard. Can not rave about this product enough.</li>
    <li> I brought this along with the leave in and 15 min conditioner . Make my hair soo soft. Will continue use.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest foam lotion in the universe. Leaves my hair silky &amp; shining w/o being heavy. I always have an extra bottle on hand. I hope they never quit making this stuff, it&#x27;s superb.</li>
    <li> This product gives my hair awesome waves, and in very little time!  I place it on my dry hair and twist it an hour before I&#x27;m ready to go, and when I take it out, my hair is full, bouncy, shiny, and wavy.  And the waves last for days!!</li>
    <li> Love This Product,So Does My Family And Hair Dresser.</li>
    <li> excellent buy, great product</li>
    <li> My hairstylist used this on my hair and it works beautifully. I think it works better when you sit under a drier. I tried using it in Hawaii-shampoo and go-and my hair was very dry. However, My stylist told me I didn&#x27;t put enough on my hair. I will try it again on my next trip to a tropical climate.</li>
    <li> i cant live without this.</li>
    <li> This is the best wrap form ever. It&#x27;s soft and gives a good shine.  It&#x27;s holds the shape.  Way better then Motions and Lottabody wrap lotion hands down.</li>
    <li> OMG!!!! The best wrap-foaming lotion ever!!!!!!!!!! If you try this you will not want another wrap-foaming or setting  lotion.  It really, really, really does work. I put this on my wet hair and wrap it and sat under the dryer. My hair was very silky and shiny and not crisp at all. I could not keep my hand out of my hair.  Good-bye to lottobody.  I would recommend this product to all.  It does not weigh your hair down at all.  Way to go Nairobi.  You knocked it out of the park with this one.</li>
    <li> Wrapping lotion works well.  Makes hair fuller and easier to manage.</li>
    <li> This foaming lotion made my hair soft and bouncy. Also, it seems as though my drying time was much faster too. I did a complete review on my blog but I just wanted to say that I would definitely buy it again. I gave it 4 stars because of the price.</li>
    <li> I am on Healthy Hair Journey and this Foaming lotion does not leave my rollers sets hard or brittle.  It actually adds shine and softness to my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product, a stylist used this wrap lotion on my hair. I took notice of the bottle without asking her what it was.  I came home and searched the product on Amazon, ordered it and tried it!! OMG! The results are wonderful. I am now a Nairobi fan!! If you want lustrous, shiny, silky hair, this is it. Shake up the bottle, and with a few pumps on the hair, you will be transformed. No more tangles, and dry wraps!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for making this product available online. I will be back to purchase other products by Nairobi!</li>
    <li> This product was used on my hair in the salon and I wanted to try it at home. It is well worth the money</li>
    <li> I purchased this from a hair care store last year and it was the best thing to come into my life.  When I ran out, I had to have another bottle, so I decided to purchase it on Amazon as it was a little bit cheaper.  I guess the saying is true, you get what you pay for.  This product is quite watered down.  Even when I shake the bottle, the liquid that comes out most of the time is pure water.  It doesn&#x27;t even smell the same.  Unless Nairobi changed the formula, this version is horrible.</li>
    <li> This product gives my hair body and makes it easier to hot curl it.</li>
    <li> Shipping was decent and arrived before it&#x27;s expected date. It was wrapped nicely and arrived safe and sound. I love this foaming lotion b/c it works so well with my short style. I can style my hair any way w/ this foaming lotion and it sets my hair so easily. It&#x27;s a nice thick foam that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dry. Love it!</li>
    <li> If you would like a foam to lay your hair down or make manageable this is it. I love it!!! When I don&#x27;t feel like relaxing my hair and I want that look. I first deep condition for thirty mintues  wash out the product then wrap it with Nairobi foam lotion, go under the dryer for 35 mintues and style. You should try it if you have short hair or wear wraps.</li>
    <li> I purchased Nairobi Wrapp-it shine because I was looking a good wrap  lotion/setting lotion combination. I choose this one because of the excellent reviews. I must say it lives up to the five Stars. Excellent product. Thank you</li>
    <li> This did a good job for setting my hair but I did not like how it felt on day two.  Felt like there was a build up and a bit hard.</li>
    <li> I started using the Nairobi foaming lotion because my beautician uses it.  I like it because it is not sticky.  It also holds your curls in place.</li>
    <li> This product beats everyone! This is the only foam that does not leave a film after it dries or even after applying more than once.&lt;br /&gt;I would not use any other foam product besides Nairobi</li>
    <li> Love the product.  My stylist uses this product on my hair as well.</li>
    <li> I am a hairstylist and this is my FAVORITE foam wrap! My client&#x27;s hair comes out shiny and soft...love love love this product!</li>
    <li> Great foaming wrap lotion that adds body and shine. There is no flaking, or dry hair.</li>
    <li> This product seemed watered down to me.</li>
    <li> I love this product! After shampooing and conditioning my hair I use this foaming lotion and my hair is softer, has volume, and easier to curl. I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  My hair feels soft, dries fast, and I have never dealt with flaking.  A great buy :)</li>
    <li> I bought this because my hairstylist and every salon ive gone to in the last 5yrs or so uses this. Its the only one for me!</li>
    <li> Product smoothed cuticle of hair. Great!</li>
    <li> This is one the best products on the market.  Many new brands come out each year, but none of them compare to this.  It leaves the hair soft and shine without flaking every time I use.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t let this wrap lotion fool you, its wonderful. I could consider using the entire line. I haven&#x27;t seen any other product like it.</li>
    <li> Really soft hold, for both wrapping or wearing your hair curly. Not sure how it would work if you were going for more hold. I like it.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair really soft and easy to manage. I highly recommend this product for black hair especially, great for molding your hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It leaves my hair soft &amp; shiny all while making it stay in place. I will not use another setting lotion ever!!!</li>
    <li> This setting sets the standard for all others to aspire. I tried it at home and loved the results. When I visited my hairdresser, I noticed she used the same thing. Enough said.</li>
    <li> It was great !! Haven&#x27;t had a relaxer in four weeks..... Laid my hair down like I had a fresh relaxer . No flaking !!</li>
    <li> Best styling foam ever!</li>
    <li> Excellent! Leaves my hair soft and shiny. The set is not hard or stiff like others I&#x27;ve used. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE...will be ordering more soon. My hair never felt better.</li>
    <li> Nice hold on hair. I love how much it foams when working with it. My roller set came out so nice and no flakes</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky or stiff. I haven&#x27;t been able to find this in the store but I knew I needed it when my hair dresser began using it</li>
    <li> This hair product is the best wrapping lotion I have ever used. Keeps your hair soft and easy to manage. It also lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Great for setting or wrapping hair. Does not leave flakes or residue in hair. Hair is soft and supple once dry and combed out! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love love love this wrap lotion! Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this a week ago and received it pretty fast. And all I can say is WONDERFUL!! I haven&#x27;t used this product in years ,but I remembered how amazing my hair felt when I was permed. Now that I&#x27;m natural I tried it using curlformers, and when my hair dried it was so soft and bouncy I didn&#x27;t expect for it to feel just as wonderful as it did when my hair was straight. Anyways, don&#x27;t look any further if your looking for a foam wrap. This is creme de la creme.</li>
    <li> Shine and volume. My roller set was gorg!</li>
    <li> I actually saw that my stylist was using this to wrap my hair prior to going under the hair dryer.  It always left my hair soft, shiny and manageable.  I was buying this from a beauty supply store and I just recently found it on Amazon...way to go!  Amazon has everything!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It does not leave a build up on the hair. It is soft and bouncy and it doesn&#x27;t get hard.</li>
    <li> I have short relaxed hair and I have been looking for a foam wrap that will not dry out my scalp (I have extremely dry hair and scalp), make my hair shiny and give it bounce and lay it down WITHOUT product buildup and \\&quot;hard\\&quot; unmovable hair... I have found what I&#x27;ve been looking for in this product! Yes, it&#x27;s a bit spendy but who cares! It cost more to go to the beauty shop and even more (time, effort and money) to keep your hair healthy! Hands down... I will buy again!</li>
    <li> One of the best wrap foams especially for natural hair it doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard you can comb through it with no tangles no stickiness.  Will purchase this again and will recommend as well.</li>
    <li> Hair is not hard when dried and not flakes.  Smells good and holds hair in place.</li>
    <li> Great product. Leaves hair soft and shiny without the buildup.</li>
    <li> No other wrap lotion compares to this!!!! Please don&#x27;t discontinue! I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Great hold, no flaking and keeps my hair soft. I have relaxes fine hair and this product even works well with taming new growth as well. Must have product!!</li>
    <li> My hair stylist use this foaming wrap and I love the scent and how soft it makes my hair. Highly Recommend for any kind of hair texture.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s one of the few products that actually does what it says.  So many times I have bought a wrap lotion with the promise not to flake and once again I&#x27;m dissapointed, not this time.  Only withdrawal is the price, but I guess you have to pay for quality.</li>
    <li> I love the texture and smell of this product and I would recommend it to all my family and friends.</li>
