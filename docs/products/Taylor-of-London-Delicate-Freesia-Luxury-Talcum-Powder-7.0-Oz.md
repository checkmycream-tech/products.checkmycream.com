      <li>This works out fine for me; pretty tin, too.&lt;br /&gt;Taylor of London has a good product.</li>
      <li>a lovely light fragrance</li>
      <li>This is great to deal with the oily skin, Southern summer sweats, and night flashes.</li>
      <li>When I first sniffed this powder, I wasn&#x27;t too sure:</li>
      <li>it has a rich freesia scent</li>
      <li>The scent is light and fresh.</li>
      <li>That should hold me until I fall in love with a new fragrance!</li>
      <li>I used to use the toilet water and loved it.</li>
      <li>This is a super smelling fragrance.</li>
      <li>God bless for selling a product that she loves so much!!</li>
      <li>Women appreciate pretty displays of product and these look like they&#x27;ve been around the block- twice!</li>

      <li>The powder has a pleasant scent, a little stronger than Yardley products.</li>

      <li>The only way I could buy more was to look online and find some through AmazonSmile.  </li>
      <li>works like any other talcum powder, but, it smells nice, on ladies.  </li>
      <li>and she just loves the fragrance so much.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;s of high quality and</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I wish this fragrance was available in other forms.</li>

      <li>A terrific price for a large amount of smoothness in the summer heatwave:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product for young and old alike--</li>
      <li>It is true to the freesia fragrance, and a little luxury each morning.</li>
      <li>But, if you use this on top of your lotion where you use the moisture as a base, then powdering over it, will prolong this lovely fragrance.</li>
      <li>Love  this delicate powder!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft subtle aroma keeps me feeling and smelling fresh.</li>

<li> and i go sock less in a lot of our shoes and talcum powder</li>
<li> it&#x27;s not really a sweet fragrance.</li>
<li> Only faintly like freesia, which is a pity.</li>
<li> The product has shipped twice now with dents on the tin, and not just small dents.</li>
<li> The scent is very heavy, and a bit overbearing.</li>
<li> I loveTaylor of London Delicate Freesia.</li>
<li> This is a delicate fragrance.  </li>
<li> Like other reviewers I was disappointed that the container was bent.</li>
<li> but I&#x27;ve tried must &amp; have never been disappointed.</li>

    <li> I simply love it! Wonderful after the bain!</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite scent since I was a child... I still want the spray cologne but have to repurchase it as the first one never came (different shipper).</li>
    <li> Refreshing and soothing. Makes me feel like a Victorian lady.</li>
    <li> This powder is wonderful! Feels great going on &amp; the fragrances are beautiful-it always make me feel good when I use it, which is after every shower. My favorite scent is Lily of the Valley but I&#x27;ve tried must &amp; have never been disappointed. I was given this as a gift years ago &amp; is been the only body power I&#x27;ve used since.</li>
    <li> When I first sniffed this powder, I wasn&#x27;t too sure: it&#x27;s not really a sweet fragrance. However, it has grown on me and I love the delicate clean notes. A terrific price for a large amount of smoothness in the summer heatwave:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I do not recommend purchasing this even though I love the fragrance. The product has shipped twice now with dents on the tin, and not just small dents. Women appreciate pretty displays of product and these look like they&#x27;ve been around the block- twice! I&#x27;m very disappointed because I&#x27;m a Prime member and have appreciated the great shipping.</li>
    <li> More like 7 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Soft feminine fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Classy looking bottle.</li>
    <li> a lovely light fragrance</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents along with lavender</li>

    <li> very satisfied, and love the scent...</li>
    <li> Had this talc before and it never changes. Love the scent.</li>
    <li> I  have fluctuating hormones, hot flashes galore! This is great to deal with the oily skin, Southern summer sweats, and night flashes. It&#x27;s soft subtle aroma keeps me feeling and smelling fresh.</li>
    <li> works like any other talcum powder, but, it smells nice, on ladies.  my fianc&amp;eacute; and i go sock less in a lot of our shoes and talcum powder has been a staple in our household in the form of goldbond.  i wanted something nicer and ladylike so i purchased this by the nice reviews it had.  the container is beautiful.  it&#x27;ll probably last me for years.  and it smells really nice.</li>
    <li> The powder has a pleasant scent, a little stronger than Yardley products. It comes in a pretty tin; unfortunately, that tin has a leak. There was powder in the package when I opened it, and there is a little powder on the dresser every time after I pick it up, not enough to lose a lot of the product, but enough to leave a mess.</li>
    <li> I like the powder, no old lady smell but can was dented and powder was coming out.  Had to duck tape can to keep powder in.  They should  pack it better for shipping.</li>
    <li> Love  this delicate powder!  The scent is light and fresh. Recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a delicate scent that makes me happy every day.  It is true to the freesia fragrance, and a little luxury each morning.</li>
    <li> I loveTaylor of London Delicate Freesia. First used it in London UK found it on Amazon Very happy</li>
    <li> This is a delicate fragrance.  I have been using Taylor of London Freesia Luxury Talcum Powder for 32 years and. and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance! Its light and warm. I have a bottle of Taylor&#x27;s spray cologne that I bought in London some time ago, but I can&#x27;t find any more online. I wish this fragrance was available in other forms.</li>
    <li> Prompt mailing. Love&lt;br /&gt;The product is great. Thank you.</li>
    <li> It smells so good! Like other reviewers I was disappointed that the container was bent. I&#x27;ll definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> I used to use the toilet water and loved it. This smells just like it.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for about a month. It is very refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;If you like the smell of freesia, this will do.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome body powder!  Smells wonderful.  You should try it.</li>
    <li> Basic problem was that the tin was damaged and powder was leaking out of the container. It was not usable!</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance and not an easily found product on local store shelves.  The shaker can is easy to use, unbreakable, and a perfect gift for the senior who enjoys using bath products.</li>
    <li> This works out fine for me; pretty tin, too.&lt;br /&gt;Taylor of London has a good product. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Found my first tin of this at Home Goods store and loved it.  The only way I could buy more was to look online and find some through AmazonSmile.  I bought out a vendor&#x27;s supply from Florida.  That should hold me until I fall in love with a new fragrance!</li>
    <li> The scent is very heavy, and a bit overbearing. Only faintly like freesia, which is a pity. Still, it is usable if you use it sparingly.</li>
    <li> The freesia fragrance is so springlike and refreshing.  I could happily recommend it to anyone who enjoys the luxuriousness of talcum powder.</li>
    <li> Product I&#x27;s of high quality and the fragrance is like., Lying down in a field of wildflowers on a midsummer day.</li>
    <li> My 78 year mum has been using this and she just loves the fragrance so much. She tells me it reminds her of some great moments.God bless for selling a product that she loves so much!!</li>
    <li> I fell in love with Taylor&#x27;s freesia talc 3 years ago  and have been using it as if it were gold....and I am very fussy...so happy I found it again!!!  Beats Johnson&#x27;s powder...Gold Bond or any of the other standards on the Market...bought 2... one for friend who introduced it to me.</li>
    <li> This is a super smelling fragrance. I used this as a child. However this one doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the one I remember! Did someone change the fragrance somehow?  But, if you use this on top of your lotion where you use the moisture as a base, then powdering over it, will prolong this lovely fragrance.</li>
