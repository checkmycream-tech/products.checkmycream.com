### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>so I always go to Amazon and find the best deals on things.  </li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>I have incredibly oily skin</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>They seem to have just what I am looking for at a great price.[[ASIN:B001U0OVGI Noxzema Anti-Blemish Pads, 90-Count Pads (Pack of 4)]]</li>
      <li>great product.  </li>
      <li>The &#x27;stinging&#x27; sensation others have been talking about doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, in fact, I kind of like it!</li>
      <li>Great price, delivered at good timing, and product was as described.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I think this is a good product and would recommend, I wish it didn&#x27;t make my face shiny though.</li>
      <li>I never thought my face could look this good .</li>
      <li>I have been using this product at night every night, after cleansing and before the moisturizer and u can see the residual dirt on it when you use it, and it also adds a BHA as salicilyc acid at a good dose which is also good.</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>Not as good as the cleansing cream, but not awful&lt;</li>
      <li>:) Be happy</li>
      <li>This product continues Noxzema outstanding product line!</li>
      <li>Even though this is a problem I am keeping my 5-star rating because they work amazingly well for my skin.</li>
      <li>am very satisfied with these, as my face feels refreshed and clean after.</li>
      <li>/&gt;-smell is okay.</li>
      <li>dont over think it, it will get better.</li>
      <li>so I still have a problem with blackheads that this anti-blemish cleansing pads weren&#x27;t able to deal with.</li>
      <li>Use lotion for face that is appropriate for your skin type.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I love these blemish pads.</li>
      <li>I would recommend it to everyone, just make sure to wash your face in the morning with a trusty cleansing wash.</li>
      <li>but more then ave I think.</li>
      <li>I love these pads.</li>
      <li>Hyperpigmentation is 50% better than from when I started.</li>
      <li>and so glad it is still around.</li>
      <li>I love this product and it is easy to use and take with you on trips.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used two of these pads since I got them 3 or 4 days ago, and so far I feel like they&#x27;re great for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I sleep with a towel on my pillow every night to keep my pillow case from becoming a greasy mess.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Make sure to keep your eyes closed and stop breathing when you&#x27;re using these lol, very strong.</li>
      <li>and then it&#x27;s not nearly as bad as it used to be!</li>
      <li>so this might be too strong for some people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>: the chemical smell and vapors are so strong that it makes my eyes water every time I use it.</li>
      <li>The vapors are strong.</li>
      <li>Not to mention that the pads have a strong scent of rubbing alcohol, no wonder it stung.</li>
      <li>This product is amazing and a highly recommend it .</li>
      <li>This is not a product worth the price or the pain!</li>
      <li>Then I clean my face with this that night befor bed and every morning.</li>
      <li>I feel clean after using it on my face.</li>
      <li>/&gt;-there is a good amount of product on the pads, not soaked, but not dry either&lt;</li>
      <li>you are familiar with Noxema, you will be as happy with this as you are with their other products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for the past week and compared to Stridex (which works great) and Clearasil (just OK), they&#x27;re not doing anything.</li>
      <li>I really wonder how many of these 5-star reviews were written by Noxzema reps.</li>
      <li>This stuff is full of skin irritants like menthol, alcohol and camphor.</li>
      <li>but when I don&#x27;t have the energy to do the full routine, I use these pads to remove residue and exfoliate before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have combination skin that is kind of sensitive.</li>
      <li>I used to have a face full of pimples.</li>
      <li>Luckily, that hasn&#x27;t caused any pimples to grow.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing because it cleared up my grand-daughters face after trying so many other products.  </li>
      <li>This will do more harm than good, especially if you have sensitive skin, there are far better exfoliants out there with safer ingredients.</li>
      <li>These textured salicylic acid facial pads work better on my skin than all the others I&#x27;ve tried</li>
      <li>: it clears away a lot of dirt and oil generated by your skin that some soaps and the like didn&#x27;t get the first time around.</li>
      <li>I suppose it&#x27;s probably better to actually wash your face at night before bed if you have makeup on, or if you sweat a lot at the gym or work in landscaping or whatever,</li>
      <li>Make sure you are washing face daily when your not using the pads.</li>
      <li>I figured that these pads would be a cheap way to clear my skin up</li>
      <li>I hold my breath when I use them, wiping over my nose and chin area first, so it dries before I have to breath again</li>
      <li>They actually have a rough feel to them, which seems to be more effective on my skin for removing dirt and oil.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t bother with this product, your better off checking out a CVS or Walgreens and searching for some facial scrub.</li>
      <li>(Clean n Clear, Biore, etc.)</li>
      <li>clean my face well, as far as I can tell.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t let it scare you, though, if you have very oily skin and don&#x27;t always have the energy to wash and rinse your face with soap/liquid cleanser and water at the end of the day or first thing in the morning.</li>
      <li>The only downside to it is that the smell is beyond strong.</li>
      <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the strong vapors.</li>
      <li>Let me first start off by saying I&#x27;ve used the Original Deep Cleasning Cream forever</li>
      <li>He would have a real issue with trying to wash his face before going to sleep and he&#x27;d break out.</li>
      <li>You can really feel them working, and I would notice my pimples disappear in over 3 days.</li>
      <li>haha.</li>
      <li>It really cleans your pores very well.</li>
      <li>So, be careful with them, and be sure to moisturize after using them.  </li>
      <li>The reason that it is not a 5 star review is because I have started waking up with a VERY oily face.</li>
      <li>fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Very convenient pads.</li>
      <li>the tingling of this product is almost too much for me.</li>
      <li>BUT it dries them out and closes the pores really well.</li>
      <li>I tend to have very oily skin, so the gentler alcohol-free cleansing pads I have tried don&#x27;t work as well for</li>
      <li>They sure SMELL useful--the scent is strong enough to burn your eyes and knock out small animals.</li>
      <li>My black-heads tends to be in very deep pores, while my white heads seem to be more on the surface level...</li>
      <li>It has strong scent,and it can be over powering around nose and eyes be careful.</li>
      <li>other reviewers have noted, these pads have an EXTREMELY strong chemical odor.</li>
      <li>so as an result those pads can&#x27;t really get to my black-heads to clear them out at all...</li>
      <li>and I love seeing the results of all the dirt and dead skin cells it picks up...</li>
      <li>They really work to clear acne overnight and keep new ones from reappearing.</li>
      <li>(They might be better for less sensitive body-parts, like backs.  </li>
      <li>: Wash off makeup with Noxema Classic Clean Original Deep Cleansing Cream, pat dry face, use Noxzema Ultimate Clear Anti-blemish pad, moisturize.</li>
      <li>/&gt;AM: Wash off nightly mask of Noxema Classic Clean Original Deep Cleansing Cream, pat dry face, use Noxzema Ultimate Clear Anti-blemish pad, moisturize, apply makeup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I guess this product would work better when coupled with another product specifically meant to deal with deep pores and other blemishes that went deeper than the surface of your face.</li>
      <li>Not only did the product not work for my skin, it actually irritated my acne and on top of that, the smell is enough to knock you out!</li>
      <li>Using these twice, though, doesn&#x27;t turn out the same - the second one is clean.</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t really work on blackheads, this seems to work mainly for white-heads only.</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s a 24 year old Hispanic male who sweats more than your average dude.</li>
      <li>I use these in conjunction with the Noxema Classic Clean Original Deep Cleansing Cream and my skin has finally stopped breaking out after a 5 year battle (late 20&#x27;s to early 30&#x27;s).</li>
      <li>Cleans, freshens and keep your skin clear.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for sensitive skin types.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Sometimes I use before a shower, as I rinse off the harsher chemicals immediately and follow with a gentle non-soap facial cleanser, to get the exfoliating pore-penetrating effects of the pads without the drying effects.</li>
      <li>My skin completely stopped breaking out immediately.</li>
      <li>Really like it, the formula seems different than it used to be.</li>
      <li>I use them at work for a quick rub down.</li>
      <li>; Really dries up skin, but be careful when using it on the same area too much and too soon…</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great. I bought this for my husband who works nights and when he gets home after work, he is extremely tired. Especially the nights where he works doubles back to back. I bought it so he can just come home and wipe his face and just go to sleep. He would have a real issue with trying to wash his face before going to sleep and he&#x27;d break out. And it works. It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do. He&#x27;s a 24 year old Hispanic male who sweats more than your average dude.</li>
    <li> I love these pads. Yes, they make your face sting but only for a moment. They really work to clear acne overnight and keep new ones from reappearing. I use nightly and have no problems with dryness. I have combination skin that is kind of sensitive.</li>
    <li> Really like it, the formula seems different than it used to be.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing because it cleared up my grand-daughters face after trying so many other products.  I could not find it in the store after I bought a bottle of these pads so I always go to Amazon and find the best deals on things.  They seem to have just what I am looking for at a great price.[[ASIN:B001U0OVGI Noxzema Anti-Blemish Pads, 90-Count Pads (Pack of 4)]]</li>
    <li> I have been using these for several years now. The &#x27;stinging&#x27; sensation others have been talking about doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, in fact, I kind of like it! I&#x27;m amazed by the dirt that comes off my face with these pads...I look at the pads and think yuck! I also use them to help take off makeup. They definitely do their job.</li>
    <li> Great product! &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; Really dries up skin, but be careful when using it on the same area too much and too soon… You&#x27;ll start flaking for days after. If you apply it maybe once a day instead of 3 times per day, than you should be fine…. That&#x27;s what I do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used noxzema blemish pads for years. It really cleans your pores very well. Prevents blemishes and scarring.</li>
    <li> Why in the world is denatured alcohol in this product? Denatured alcohol is vile, by design. It&#x27;s what they put in antifreeze so kids &amp; pets won&#x27;t drink it. It makes these pads smell horrible and the vapor makes me cough. I really wonder how many of these 5-star reviews were written by Noxzema reps. I would only recommend this product to my enemies. I&#x27;m going back to the Stridex pads, they work just as well on my acne and I don&#x27;t have to hold my breath when I use them.</li>
    <li> works well at keeping my oily skin under control. i use it with the lathering cleanser and it works well, though maybe not quite as well as it&#x27;s predecessor &amp;#34;triple clean&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This product continues Noxzema outstanding product line! I&#x27;ve used Aveeno cleansing pads previously for double the price and half the results.  The instant noticeable factor is you can litterally see the amount of dirt on the noxzema pad that is being cleansed from your face! Secondly if you have any current pimples it begins to dry them out instantly within a day or two!</li>
    <li> These work and I feel clean after using it on my face. One complaint the odor is strong and a little offensive. I will continue to use this until I find another but it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
    <li> Gosh once 3 pm hits I feel so grimy in my face - what a relief to have this product to refresh from a long day of work or just  on a daily basis, I am lost without it - I wash my face daily but without this regiment  for the late morning or early afternoon when I get that build up I&#x27;d be rising my face with water as in the past until I discovered how great this product is, try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> I use them at work for a quick rub down. Make sure to keep your eyes closed and stop breathing when you&#x27;re using these lol, very strong.</li>
    <li> Great price, delivered at good timing, and product was as described.</li>
    <li> I love this product and it is easy to use and take with you on trips.  Good product.</li>
    <li> I never thought my face could look this good . This product is amazing and a highly recommend it . However I still get a blemish every now and then it&#x27;s not nearly as bad as it used to be!</li>
    <li> These textured salicylic acid facial pads work better on my skin than all the others I&#x27;ve tried (Clean n Clear, Biore, etc.) so I&#x27;m giving them a 5-star rating. They actually have a rough feel to them, which seems to be more effective on my skin for removing dirt and oil. I tend to have very oily skin, so the gentler alcohol-free cleansing pads I have tried don&#x27;t work as well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have noted, these pads have an EXTREMELY strong chemical odor. I hold my breath when I use them, wiping over my nose and chin area first, so it dries before I have to breath again haha. I usually fan my face when I inhale again so as not to breathe in the smell. Don&#x27;t let it scare you, though, if you have very oily skin and don&#x27;t always have the energy to wash and rinse your face with soap/liquid cleanser and water at the end of the day or first thing in the morning. I suppose it&#x27;s probably better to actually wash your face at night before bed if you have makeup on, or if you sweat a lot at the gym or work in landscaping or whatever, but when I don&#x27;t have the energy to do the full routine, I use these pads to remove residue and exfoliate before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I use before a shower, as I rinse off the harsher chemicals immediately and follow with a gentle non-soap facial cleanser, to get the exfoliating pore-penetrating effects of the pads without the drying effects.</li>
    <li> This is not a product worth the price or the pain! These pads promised to clean and cleanse pimples and blemishes but it failed to mention the stinging and irritation that occurs after each application. I bought this product in a rush to get rid of a few zits I had but I can tell you that my decision to buy these pads was a mistake. I figured that these pads would be a cheap way to clear my skin up but I found out that the way they work is to dry the hell out of your zits because after an hour or so, my whole face not only stung but it was peeling. Not to mention that the pads have a strong scent of rubbing alcohol, no wonder it stung. Don&#x27;t bother with this product, your better off checking out a CVS or Walgreens and searching for some facial scrub.</li>
    <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the strong vapors. I have to fan my face to quickly dry it or try to hold my breath. The vapors are strong. I do like the outcome of the product enough to keep using it in spite of this though.</li>
    <li> I play a lot of sports. Sometimes I am out all day playing games and/or tournaments and I have no time to wash my face in between every game. I just wipe these over my face after I play and they prevent my face from breaking out due to sweat.. I will say that they work wonders for me. The only downside to it is that the smell is beyond strong. When I use them around my nose, I have to hold my breath or it will burn my nose severely. The smell eventually goes away in about 5-10 minutes. Even though this is a problem I am keeping my 5-star rating because they work amazingly well for my skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is full of skin irritants like menthol, alcohol and camphor. It burned and irritated my face, so I thought since my face can&#x27;t handle it , maybe I can&#x27;t use it on my Bacne since the skin there is tougher, horrible mistake- I&#x27;m suffering a rash of breakouts and it has exacerbated the acne on my arms and it is unbearably itchy and inflamed. I would not recommend this to anyone- please thoroughly research the ingredients in the products you are buying beforehand. I bought this on a whim because it was on sale and dirt cheap and was desperate to treat my acne. This will do more harm than good, especially if you have sensitive skin, there are far better exfoliants out there with safer ingredients. It&#x27;s going to take awhile before my skin recovers from the damage this has done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for  about 15 years.  They kick-@$$.  If your skin is a little chapped, freshly exfoliated, or otherwise tender, it&#x27;s yours they&#x27;ll kick.  Between having enough menthol (that&#x27;s the smell, and a medication) and salicylic acid in them to actually work, and a pad-texture that actually rubs your rough places plain (a.k.a. shiny), these will get the job done.  So, be careful with them, and be sure to moisturize after using them.  (They might be better for less sensitive body-parts, like backs.  I use them around my ears and as a foot-freshener while camping.)  I&#x27;m always disappointed when I try other pads.  They just seem wimpy.  If I use these right after another brand, these always pick up stuff the other left behind.  Using these twice, though, doesn&#x27;t turn out the same - the second one is clean.</li>
    <li> I am currently in a desert environment, and needed something for my skin. I grew up with Noxema, and decided to purchase these in place of the Clean and Clear pads I have which I am very unhappy with.&lt;br /&gt;If you are familiar with Noxema, you will be as happy with this as you are with their other products. If you haven&#x27;t used salicylic acid, test before using thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with these, as my face feels refreshed and clean after.</li>
    <li> it cleaned as expected</li>
    <li> Pros: it clears away a lot of dirt and oil generated by your skin that some soaps and the like didn&#x27;t get the first time around. It ends up having like a yellowish-grey smudge on the cleaning pads even after I get out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So on that front it delivers on it&#x27;s promise to clear away dirt and other things that other cleaners couldn&#x27;t get to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; works on white-heads and any other surface-level blemishes only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the chemical smell and vapors are so strong that it makes my eyes water every time I use it. it&#x27;s enough to make you feel dizzy sometimes too... so this might be too strong for some people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This doesn&#x27;t really work on blackheads, this seems to work mainly for white-heads only. My black-heads tends to be in very deep pores, while my white heads seem to be more on the surface level... so as an result those pads can&#x27;t really get to my black-heads to clear them out at all... so I still have a problem with blackheads that this anti-blemish cleansing pads weren&#x27;t able to deal with. I guess this product would work better when coupled with another product specifically meant to deal with deep pores and other blemishes that went deeper than the surface of your face.</li>
    <li> I use these in conjunction with the Noxema Classic Clean Original Deep Cleansing Cream and my skin has finally stopped breaking out after a 5 year battle (late 20&#x27;s to early 30&#x27;s). I have tried EVERYTHING... a round of accutane, several rounds of antibiotics, the Acne.org Regimen, Retin-A, oil cleansing, tea tree oil, every over the counter product you can think of as well as every topical prescription the dermatologist could put me on and NOTHING worked. I was sooooo depressed about having such bad adult acne. I became a hermit and only left my house if I had too. I even started a business so that I could work from home! In the end, silly Noxzema products ended up being MY answer. Who would have thought?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My regimen:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AM: Wash off nightly mask of Noxema Classic Clean Original Deep Cleansing Cream, pat dry face, use Noxzema Ultimate Clear Anti-blemish pad, moisturize, apply makeup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PM: Wash off makeup with Noxema Classic Clean Original Deep Cleansing Cream, pat dry face, use Noxzema Ultimate Clear Anti-blemish pad, moisturize. Before bed, apply a face mask of Noxema Classic Clean Original Deep Cleansing Cream (apply one thin coat, wait to dry, apply second thin coat). Before I go to sleep, product is dry, but greasy. I sleep with a towel on my pillow every night to keep my pillow case from becoming a greasy mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now one month into this regimen. My skin completely stopped breaking out immediately. Pores were visibly reduced within 3 days and have continued to get smaller and/or disappear altogether. Hyperpigmentation is 50% better than from when I started. My skin has not become dry and/or flaky at any point, BUT I was using Retin-A prior to starting this regimen, so my skin was very used to harsh products being used on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps someone!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product at night every night, after cleansing and before the moisturizer and u can see the residual dirt on it when you use it, and it also adds a BHA as salicilyc acid at a good dose which is also good.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing I buy for the last 15 years.It has strong scent,and it can be over powering around nose and eyes be careful.It give a sting if you have open sores on face.BUT it dries them out and closes the pores really well.Be careful that you are prepared for over drying if you use it all the time.Use lotion for face that is appropriate for your skin type.Make sure you are washing face daily when your not using the pads.I only use anti bacterial soap on my face and my issues are at a minimum.I am 35 years old , but have issues due to Poly cystic ovarian syndrome.I tend to break out some due to slight hair growth then the ave person.Not a beard or all that but more then ave I think.It helps keep things to a minimum and I love seeing the results of all the dirt and dead skin cells it picks up...I use it alot when im breaking out for other reason like  it over drying a tad to get rid of dark scars when used from the start.Not after they heal.Its helped me minimize my scaring as well.its dried em up and helped to flake them off.But that is just me.Remember if you have scaring it takes a while to fade.And if they are swollen scars it takes time to go down as well.But it will happen.I mean it could be worse ladies and gentleman.:) Be happy dont over think it, it will get better.</li>
    <li> I have incredibly oily skin and this helps dry it out. Of course it burns like hell fire if you have an open wound type area, but for the most part it helps balance out my disgusting teenage face. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for sensitive skin types. If you can stand the initial burning then you might benefit from it.</li>
    <li> Yikes. I&#x27;ve been using these for the past week and compared to Stridex (which works great) and Clearasil (just OK), they&#x27;re not doing anything. They sure SMELL useful--the scent is strong enough to burn your eyes and knock out small animals. But they&#x27;re not very comfortable on my skin and they don&#x27;t clear up my face at all. I&#x27;m going back to Stridex ASAP.</li>
    <li> It extra cleans. If u have tiny scabs or dead skin you cant see under your chin or on your neck shave line, it get it. I shave, wash with anti bacterial soap then aply aftershave. Then I clean my face with this that night befor bed and every morning. U can use this befor u shave as well. Pick all your ingrowns up with a needle or tweezers (dont pluck or yank out. Stand them up), and then use this. Wait a hour and the shave and do the steps I explained. And watch!!</li>
    <li> I love these blemish pads. I used to have a face full of pimples. Now, I barely have any. I put these on when I wake up and when I go to sleep. You can really feel them working, and I would notice my pimples disappear in over 3 days. The reason that it is not a 5 star review is because I have started waking up with a VERY oily face. You wake up looking as if someone slapped you with a piece of bacon.  Although my face was oily to begin with, this is a different type of oily. It is all over the face and is less subtle. Luckily, that hasn&#x27;t caused any pimples to grow. I would recommend it to everyone, just make sure to wash your face in the morning with a trusty cleansing wash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and so glad it is still around. Cleans, freshens and keep your skin clear.</li>
    <li> great product.  fast shipping.</li>
    <li> works for my skin. Use them twice daily. I have dry skin, sometimes a little oil. And small breakouts here and there. Very convenient pads.</li>
    <li> I got these at my local Walgreens for &amp;lt;$5. Let me first start off by saying I&#x27;ve used the Original Deep Cleasning Cream forever and I love it. I&#x27;d never tried any other Noxzema products though until I picked this up along with the scrub. Noxzema products are generally a bit cheaper than other brands like Neutrogena and Clearsil and whatnot, so that&#x27;s a plus. I&#x27;ve used two of these pads since I got them 3 or 4 days ago, and so far I feel like they&#x27;re great for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-They clean my face well, as far as I can tell.&lt;br /&gt;-Cheap, 90 pads for &amp;lt;$5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrals&lt;br /&gt;-smell is okay. Not as good as the cleansing cream, but not awful&lt;br /&gt;-there is a good amount of product on the pads, not soaked, but not dry either&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-My face is shiny after I use them, which can be a little annoying. Especially since I&#x27;m planning on using them as touch ups&lt;br /&gt;-compared to the other pads I&#x27;ve used (clearasil and strydex) the tingling of this product is almost too much for me. It also makes my eyes burn a little, but that doesn&#x27;t last very long, so it&#x27;s not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a good product and would recommend, I wish it didn&#x27;t make my face shiny though.</li>
    <li> Not only did the product not work for my skin, it actually irritated my acne and on top of that, the smell is enough to knock you out!</li>
