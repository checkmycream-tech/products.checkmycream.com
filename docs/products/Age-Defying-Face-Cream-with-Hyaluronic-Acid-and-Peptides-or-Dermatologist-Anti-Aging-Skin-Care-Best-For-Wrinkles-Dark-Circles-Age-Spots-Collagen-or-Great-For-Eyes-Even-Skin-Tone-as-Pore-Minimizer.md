<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Perfect&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was another face cream that was in the gift pack I received as a present.&lt;br /&gt;As an advocate of Mother Nature and a person who pays close attention to the chemicals I come in contact with, it can be difficult to find the right moisturizer. This natural skin care product finally fit the bill. It gives me the kinds of results that I want without exposing me to products that will ultimately harm my body over time. After conducting a little personal research, I was also happy to find that the company practices responsible manufacturing processes as well.&lt;br /&gt;When I look for new products to add to my thorough beauty routine, my search is as well focused on active ingredients and the science behind the compounds. I am happy to report that my use of Anaiti moisturizer meets all of my strict requirements when it comes to a scientific approach that blends natural ingredients with clinical research. One of my main concerns for my skin is its ability to heal itself and its maintenance of elasticity. Because this product uses peptides for collagen production, it is highly effective in these applications. I would gladly recommend it to any of my friends and family with the same goals for their skin.&lt;br /&gt;Many people fail to understand that there can be a major difference between a simple moisturizing cream and products that promise anti-aging effects. Anaiti offered both. It gives you a deeps sense of hydration while also including the ingredients that are necessary to qualify it as an effective anti aging moisturizer cream. I am thankful for a product that is balanced and honest about its abilities and effectiveness.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:586f929cb9fa4e49374cc3d61d99ed4c]] This cream has actually reduced the look and size of my pores near my nose and the base of my chin, and it&#x27;s only been a week!  I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does after a few weeks, or even months.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:65ab4d2a7bb15c632e0ba3c4d68e7112]]I am loosing my crows feet! Yes, I am a guy but I like to look younger too! I will NEVER opt for botox. I hate needles! But with this amazing cream by Anaiti, I don&#x27;t have too! I can see the difference when I use the cream! I even created this video because words alone can express my feelings!</li>
    <li> Have only used the Anaiti Age-Defying Face Cream for a week or so, but I love the feel and smell of the product, and it seems to be living up to it&#x27;s advertising.</li>
    <li> I received the Anaiti Age Defying cream for free for reviewing purpooses and I´m liking it very much.&lt;br /&gt;I´m a make up artist and my skin has to look it´s best! So I treat it as much as I can with face creams, serums and everything to avoid surgeries!&lt;br /&gt;I´m 40 years old and I got to the point where I need a good anti aging face cream. Well here I have it.&lt;br /&gt;I aply it twice a day after my luminous serum by Anaiti as well and my skin could not look better. Smoth, plumped, bright, I can´t say yet if my wrinkles dissapeared because I´ve been using it for just 2 weeks, but my skin looks a lot better. I love the scent it has! Not a lot! is just a slight citrus scent, smells like spring. The only thing I don´t like is that I have very very dry skin and I need to feel my skin like there´s something there..and at this face cream gets TOTALLY absorved! After 2 minutes there´s no trace of it. So I have to use another face cream on top to feel my skin moistured. It would be perfect for oily skin or for people who doesn´t like the feeling of any cream over their skin.&lt;br /&gt;As I said before I like it very much but I would rather have it feeling more moiturizing</li>
    <li> The skin feels really dry also I&#x27;m braking out. I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 days and can&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:642a2ae333b2b14f7f7b8ce0d178de2f]]I have suffered for many years with dry skin and after using, what seemed like hundreds of lotions and potions I came across this Advanced Age-Defying face cream by Anaiti. I can honestly say it&#x27;s one of the best if not THE best face cream I have ever used. I am now in my fifties and I am trying to slow down the aging process so I am desperate to try anything. This cream however has certainly done exactly what it says on the jar. It has allowed my skin to hydrate again and maintain a smooth soft skin that I had in my youth. Once the skin became smooth it also evened out any wrinkles that had started to appear. The fact that it is oil free allows it to penetrate into the skin and gives the skin a nice fresh feel and a firmer tone. I wouldn&#x27;t have a clue about the ingredients that go into making the product, but what I do know is that for the first time in my later years I have found the ideal cream that helps me feel younger and has given me a youthful spring in my step again.</li>
    <li> Very nice moisturizing cream. Nice subtle scent. Absorbs easily. Leaves skin feeling soft, smooth and hydrated. Not greasy or sticky. Had age fighting ingredients including HYALURONIC ACID, MATRIXYL and RENOVAGE. Sample received for testing and review purposes.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful age-defying cream. It is a very light cream that doesnt make your skin greasy and it absorbs really quickly. It has a smell of a citrusy lotion and when you put it on your skin it leaves your skin feeling soft and well hydrated. It works wonders on wrinkles under your eyes and it is a great product for all types of skin. I have tried several of Anaiti&#x27;s products and they all live up to expectation this is really high quality stuff that is worth the money</li>
    <li> Love it.  Really makes a difference.  Even my husband is using it.</li>
    <li> Let me first say that I do not normally use anything on my face except for soap and water and I never have. I am 50 years old. When I was younger I was often told I looked younger than I was but that isn’t quite the case lately.  I have been noticing wrinkles, dry skin and just a generally lackluster look lately so I was willing to give this a try. I started using Advanced Age-Defying Face Cream By Anaiti on July 25 and after 15 days I was starting to notice a difference. The lines are around my mouth were not as pronounced, my chin dimples didn&#x27;t look as deep and my neck looked smoother and firmer. It is still early so I haven&#x27;t noticed any change around my eyes yet but I really don&#x27;t have too much problem there so I may not. I would have to say that if used faithfully morning and night this cream can make a difference in your appearance without any needles. Who would do that? I will continue to use Anaiti Age-Defying Face Cream and am sure to see even more dramatic results ahead.  Disclaimer: I was given a jar of Anaiti Age-Defying Face Cream to try in exchange for an honest review. #AntiAgingCream</li>
    <li> I found it takes very, very little. Too much and it leaves a white &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; on the skin, though this eventually dries or absorbs. So &amp;#34;a little dab will do you&amp;#34; certainly holds true with this product making it go a long way for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually hyaluronic acid products come in the form of a liquid dispensed from a bottle with a dropper or pump. However, this product serves as serum and cream. The directions provided by Anaiti say that if your skin is dry, you can also apply another moisturizer after applying the Anaiti Wrinkle Smoothing Cream. Though my skin is not &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; skin, it is not necessarily dry. I did not, however, use another moisturizer on top of the Anaiti. After applying this product, I waited a couple of minutes for it to dry or absorb into the skin and then applied makeup (foundation, etc.). This works very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it a miracle product? Alas, there really are not any true miracles out there in the form of creams, lotions, serums. However, the miracle comes in choosing products that have an impact on the skin and using them to stave off the effects of our environment and of the simple fact that we age as the days and years roll along. The Anaiti Wrinkle Smoothing Cream is a good choice for taking good care of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received a complimentary product to facilitate this review at no cost to me. I was not compensated for this review. Opinions are my own, alone.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for quite some time now, alongside other products from this same brand. The results got me hooked because it works well with my sensitive skin, is great as far as moisture retention is concerned (something I struggle with because I have diabetic skin) and delivers what it promises to do! I am in my mid thirties, so I take extra care of my skin and try to be on top of my skin care routine because I want to avoid/delay/what-have-you the signs of premature aging. I highly recommend this product to people like me with sensitive and perpetually troublesome skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> At 35 years old, I thought I was past the point of ever having young-looking skin again, and being wrong has never made me so happy! I don’t quite remember how I stumbled upon Anaiti products, but it’s been one of the best things to happen to me recently, and my friends have taken notice. A lot of them are asking me what I’ve been doing for my skin, and most of them assume I’ve been getting weekly facials. One of them even thought I got laser resurfacing and in her words I had “celebrity skin.” Hah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m so excited to see what my skin looks like in 6 months or a year! It’s so exciting to see that my skin looks better than it did 5 years ago, and I absolutely love looking in the mirror now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve gained so much more confidence, and that’s why I had to stop in and say thanks!</li>
    <li> I like the cream. It has a fluffy texture and it feels light yet still hydrates your skin well. It seems to stay in your skin throughout the day, and keep your face creamy and soft.</li>
    <li> I have not seen any results that I could not have gotten from Oil of Olay!  It&#x27;s expensive too.</li>
    <li> I’ve been using the Advanced Age-Defying Cream for about 3 months now, and I couldn’t be happier! I had tried everything for the large pores on my nose and cheeks, and nothing worked. After 2 weeks I started noticing the pores getting smaller, improving my skin firmness for a tighter, more youthful look. I always compared my pores to the peel of an orange; the orange has pores all over the skin if you look close. Now they have closed up, and it has come with the added benefit of reduced oiliness in that area.</li>
    <li> The Advanced Age-Defying Cream by Anaiti is an all natural solution to facial injections! This cream is made in Canada in a registered facility. It is never tested on animals, is non toxic, and paraben free! This cream took years of research to come up with the perfect combination of ingredients that targets visible signs of aging! One of the ingredients is Hyaluronic Acid, which can hold up to 1000 times it&#x27;s weight in water - holding moisture into the skin and hydrating it! Another ingredient is Matrixyl which produces collagen production - and in turn increasing skin&#x27;s elasticity and firmness! Renovage is an ingredient that works deeply in skin cells and is known to help with skin pigmentation, redness, pore size, sun spots, fine lines,  and more! Together those important ingredients make up an advanced cream, that is more effective than costly injections, and can show improvement within just 30 days! It has even shown to improve wrinkle depth by 68% and firm skin 35% within one month&#x27;s use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Advanced Age-Defying cream comes in a 1.7 fl oz jar. The jar is very modern looking with easy to read, and understand, instructions.  I&#x27;ve used this cream for almost a month now, along with other Anaiti products, for the best results possible. I have also used this cream alone to see the results it would give me! I use this cream during the day, and at night! Since it&#x27;s oil free, and safe for all skin types, it is gentle enough for me to use everyday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I love The Advanced Age-Defying Cream by Anaiti:&lt;br /&gt;-The jar makes it easy to scoop out just the right amount.&lt;br /&gt;-It only takes a few dabs to rub the cream in on my face, neck, and decollete. it glides onto skin and evenly covers it!

    <li> I got this product for my wife and she is happy about it,she said that it does really work.</li>
    <li> Love the product! I have to keep my skin in tip-top shape for my teaching career, and the wrinkles by my eyes were starting to become too much. I took the problem into my own hands and bought the Advanced Age-Defying Cream as recommended by a female co-worker of mine, and I&#x27;m happy to report that after 6 weeks, they aren&#x27;t even noticeable unless you are inches away from me. Even then they are just very faint lines, and there aren&#x27;t as many of them. I expect them to fully revert back to smooth looking skin.    Very happy with the product!</li>
    <li> I love this cream! It has a lovely texture and it absorbs very quickly. It feels very rich, but doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling and keeps my skin feeling soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this with a few other Anaiti products, this is a better solution to getting costly injections and feels so much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a powerful anti-aging cream that feels light, and oily free on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always a bit skeptic when it comes to facial creams and anti-serums, but I saw all of the wonderful reviews, and had the opportunity to try this for myself for free, but only if I gave my honest and unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well here goes..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started to use this immediately after receiving it, a long with a 2 other Anaiti products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The noticeable changes I&#x27;ve seen with the use of this cream is my pore size has greatly reduced, my oily skin is not so oily anymore, I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a lightened color on my freckles and my skin feels more firm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still see some small wrinkles under my eye but you can tell they are slowly starting to fade, so I&#x27;ll have to continue to use this until it&#x27;s gone to see if there is a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anaiti Age Defying Cream is made with naturally derived ingredients and is backed by a money back guarantee, which just gives you that added confidence that if this doesn&#x27;t work they&#x27;ll give you your money back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stand by Anaiti products, and this one is really good, just need a little more time to determine the decrease in my wrinkles. So far so good! I&#x27;ll be updating this review later with pictures &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Brightens my face a little and my fine lines seem somewhat reduced, but I don&#x27;t think this product did anything more than a higher quality facial moisturizer would do.</li>
    <li> This cream seems to be doing its magic on my wrinkles! I&#x27;ve used (and still use) a couple of the other products from Anaiti and this one has lived up to my expectations. It is lovely to put on and my skin feels smoother and looks better than it has in years. I researched the active ingredients and they are well known for fighting wrinkles so I&#x27;ll continue using. I really do not want to go back to how I was looking before.</li>
    <li> This product has given me so much to look forward to! Look, being a mother of 2 at 42 years old, the evidence of my age was starting to show in the form of… wrinkles! UGH! I tried covering them up with make-up, but I ended up looking like a clown! My little 6 year old niece even asked me one day why I wear so much make-up. That little bugger! That’s when I knew I had to do something about my wrinkles. I ended up finding the Advanced Age-Defying Cream online, and I haven’t looked back since.&lt;br /&gt;I’ve tried every anti-aging cream you can get from the store and none of them did even a quarter of the job that this product did. In 2 months newer wrinkles were gone and more prominent ones are only visible if I look really close. Can you say amazing!?&lt;br /&gt;I sincerely thank you for turning back the clock on my age. (sorry for those who are over 42 !!!)</li>
    <li> I am kissing my wrinkles goodbye with the Advanced Age-Defying Cream by Anaiti. I&#x27;ve been using the cream for about a month, and I can&#x27;t get over how it&#x27;s improved the lines around my mouth. I had high hopes for the cream to brighten my dull skin and take care of those 30-year-old wrinkles. It solved both issues within a month, and every day it just gets better. It also feels great when I glide it on my face at bedtime. On a side note, my husband says he really likes the smell of the cream, so that&#x27;s an unexpected bonus!</li>
    <li> Anaiti&#x27;s products really do make you feel like a celebrity. Starting with a beautiful package and design, finished off with soft, whipped, fluffy cream. This product brings back memories of a face cream I loved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I quickly purchased almost every item in the product line, and I am more than happy I did! I absolutely love everything about Anaiti&#x27;s products, their products are all perfectly blended to provide a dewy moisture layer that quickly absorbs leaving your skin drenched with its daily moisture dose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anaiti also has critiqued a perfect balance of their key ingredients to their favorable base texture that everyone raves about! I have noticed improved skin texture and smoothness on my face with 2 weeks use. I also have not experienced 1 breakout from their formulas, I use the product 2 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a wonderful jar of Advanced Age-Defying Face Cream By Anaiti in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic. I have used many products n I love this</li>
