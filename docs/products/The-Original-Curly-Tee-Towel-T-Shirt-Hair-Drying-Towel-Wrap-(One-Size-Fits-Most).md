      <li>and I had to remove it allowing my hair to finish drying naturally and the results were still great!  </li>
      <li>gave two stars as the seller was very quick and had nice communication.</li>
      <li>I love mine.</li>
      <li>Maybe others will have better luck.</li>
      <li>Works better for me than the micro fiber towels I have also used.</li>
      <li>It is better in that it doesn&#x27;t require a lot of manipulation to tie the wrap to keep it on your head</li>
      <li>A microfiber towel is better at drying my curly hair.</li>
      <li>I thought it was adorable</li>
      <li>I decided to try this product to see if it was better than using the long-sleeved T-shirt I had been using.  </li>
      <li>I wish I didn&#x27;t look so goofy when I wear it, but it does keep hair out of the way and off the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>wanted to love it and use it all the time</li>
      <li>Now that I have the technique mastered using a t-shirt, I find that it is simply much more convenient for me rather than using the Curly Tee.  </li>
      <li>Well im glad I bought this.</li>
      <li>but this is nothing more than cotton cloth.</li>
      <li>Glad I got this.</li>
      <li>Now that I have the technique mastered using a t-shirt, I find that it is simply much more convenient for me rather than using the Curly Tee.  </li>
      <li>Well, after many uses, I don&#x27;t find this to be the case.</li>
      <li>/&gt;What would make it better for me is a heavier weight jersey fabric.  </li>
      <li>It has such nice curls afterwards and the more I use it the better my hair gets, and it was in great shape before using this, except now no frizz and soft gorgeous curls.</li>
      <li>My husband loves the curls, I&#x27;ve gotten a ton of compliments on my natural &amp;#34;curly hair&amp;#34; so I will happily add this into my hair style rotation.</li>
      <li>A word of caution, best when used in dripping wet hair that already has the conditioner and styling product pulled through.</li>
      <li>Made of T- shirt cotton and easy to tie on the head.</li>
      <li>isnt easy for me.</li>
      <li>Does the job... easy to use</li>
      <li>As for the product claims about not damaging your hair, keeping it frizz free and healthy, vegan and earth friendly</li>
      <li>I sleep with it on all night, and take it off in the morning, and voila, gorgeous soft curls!</li>
      <li>My curls stay curly and frizz free once I take off the towel.</li>
      <li>, I tighten the ties to my liking and I flip my head, tying the two \\&quot;arms\\&quot; over and its secure in place.    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been plopping now with a t-shirt for about a month with amazing results but the t-shirt really bothered me when I slept</li>
      <li>I have to believe, though, that if you have been plopping for years with a t-shirt and are skilled at it (unlike me), you probably won&#x27;t find it worth the $20 just to get a drawstring.  </li>
      <li>I have to wait until the weekend to try again as my work curls are important.</li>
      <li>I can sleep with this in my hair comfortably and not worry about it until morning.</li>
      <li>Took me a minute to figure out how to use this wrap, but after actually reading the directions I figured it out and happy I did.</li>
      <li>It was tricky trying to figure out how to tie it but definitely worth the challenge!</li>
      <li>so when I saw this I was excited to try it.</li>
      <li>I ordered my Original Curly Tee directly from their website and I must say that their customer service was outstanding!    </li>
      <li>I can plop easily in the shower right after putting my hair products in it and not worry about my hair.</li>
      <li>Even though my hair is thick and wavy with some curls in it, this tee wrap is just wonderful for my hair.</li>
      <li>What I liked most, is that it kept my wet hair out of the way while I put my make-up on.  </li>
      <li>The curly towel is wonderful and really does make my hair less frizzy!  </li>
      <li>This is the most amazing thing I&#x27;ve ever found for my extremely curly hair.</li>
      <li>I recently started hair plopping and have been very pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine straight hair.  </li>
      <li>my curls weren&#x27;t as amazing as &amp;#34;plopping&amp;#34; with a white cotton t-shirt.  </li>
      <li>So much better than my old terry hair towel.</li>
      <li>When I received my curly tee, I received along with it a postcard thanking me for the purchase with hand written annotations and smile faces.  </li>
      <li>Good for keeping wet hair out of the way, but</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is in no universe worth 20$&lt;br /&gt;Should&#x27;ve</li>
      <li>For me, it is worth it.  </li>
      <li>Better to just use an old t shirt</li>
      <li>The ease of use of this makes it worth the money.</li>
      <li>For me, it is worth it.  </li>
      <li>I was pretty excited about this product because my hair tends to be pretty frizzy.</li>
      <li>I tried sleeping with this on, to let my hair dry overnight, and after taking it off in the morning, my hair looks like I slept with a stack of books on top of my head!</li>
      <li>But on the rare occasion I have let my natural wave come out, my husband loves it, and wants me to wear my hair curly more often.</li>
      <li>The instructions that came with the product stated that once you get it right the first time, you become a pro at applying it.</li>
      <li>The package also came quickly with a hand written note saying thanks for the purchase.</li>
      <li>I put on my makeup while my hair is up in the towel and by the time im dressed w makeup, I let down the towel and my hair has beautiful soft curls (still damp but not soaking wet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And it is actually quite comfortable to wear sleeping, considering I normally am a fussy sleeper and like to be super comfortable.</li>
      <li>You can tie it many ways and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy the next day !</li>
      <li>I just put my hair through the opening, making sure that the ties are at the back of my head</li>
      <li>and although on my first attempt, it did not stay on through the night, I could see the difference on my braided hair</li>
      <li>The Ultimate T-shirt towel works much better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several times and can get better curls with my &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; towel.</li>
      <li>This product really does work!</li>
      <li>So I knew exactly what I was getting.  </li>
      <li>I love that it isn&#x27;t ruining my fragile curly hair!</li>
      <li>- simply tighten the drawstring and tie the &amp;#34;sleeves&amp;#34; of the wrap on the top of your head as you would if you were using a t-shirt.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really fit a normal sized 13 yr old girl.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even have a particularly large head.</li>
      <li>def recommend this to anyone to wants to plop easily without the hassle of having to use an actual T-shirt.</li>
      <li>I tried it for the first time the other night and it was way more comfy to sleep in</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really do as much for me as I thought it might.  </li>
      <li>however, this thing works very well.</li>
      <li>Leave your hair in the cloth while you finish getting ready, then remove the cloth to either let your hair air-dry or diffuse it.  </li>
      <li>I find it much easier now to wrap a t-shirt around my hair rather than stuffing it into this product.u</li>
      <li>I find it much easier now to wrap a t-shirt around my hair rather than stuffing it into this product.</li>
      <li>i have think curly mixed hair, and wake up with defined carefree curls after throwing my freely washed hair in it at night</li>
      <li>NO volume and very frizzy.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a nice idea, however, the big problem with it is that it does not really absorb water.  I noticed a lot of reviews mention leaving it on all night; I did not do that as I usually shower during the day.  I left it on for over an hour and my hair was still sopping wet.  I tried  it for a week and by the end of the week, my normally wavy hair was stick straight, stuck out weirdly and looked worse than it ever has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might try it with a hair mask at night, but as far as drying hair, this doesn&#x27;t work.  It also has an awkward design, so putting it on is not that easy as a Turbie Twist or Aquis towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave two stars as the seller was very quick and had nice communication.</li>
    <li> Great&#x3D; my hair is waist long I can wash it and then put it up when combed out --it will dry over night and have body --instead of having hair which is flat. My hair is fine straight hair.  This is great to use.</li>
    <li> This product did not keep the curl in my hair at all. Would not purchase again or recommend for anyone with curly hair</li>
    <li> Really did not do what I was hoping for but that could just be my hair is not thick and curly enough.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t very absorbent and very hard to put on. Didn&#x27;t really fit a normal sized 13 yr old girl. I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> This did not work for my hair.  I think a regular, old t-shirt works better.  Maybe others will have better luck.</li>
    <li> Does the job... easy to use</li>
    <li> This is a neat idea, but I ended up just getting the larger yogi brand microfiber towel.  This is apparently a medium (at least there was a tag that read M in the inside), I have hair just past my shoulder blades and would have to sort of stuff it all in there on occasion. What I liked most, is that it kept my wet hair out of the way while I put my make-up on.  Good for keeping wet hair out of the way, but if you are looking for a microfiber towel to dry your hair, I would go with something else.</li>
    <li> I was pretty excited about this product because my hair tends to be pretty frizzy. The product description and even other reviews claimed this product would help reduce frizz and leave hair looking healthy and shiny. Well, after many uses, I don&#x27;t find this to be the case. In fact, I think my hair seems even more frizzy and dull. I tried sleeping with this on, to let my hair dry overnight, and after taking it off in the morning, my hair looks like I slept with a stack of books on top of my head! NO volume and very frizzy.  The instructions that came with the product stated that once you get it right the first time, you become a pro at applying it. Umm, no. I had trouble getting my hair in it every single time I tried to use it. The concept is awesome but the product DID NOT meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> i am not sure i have seen any changes in my hair at all since switching to this towel...</li>
    <li> i must say, when i received a $20 cotton t-shirt in the mail i was a little bothered. however, this thing works very well. i get awesome curls with this thing. i have think curly mixed hair, and wake up with defined carefree curls after throwing my freely washed hair in it at night</li>
    <li> I was so looking forward to this product to try and keep my curls frizz-free, but I was sadly disappointed by the fact that it is literally a t-shirt. Aside from the obvious choice of just using one of your old t-shirts, this was way too small to fit my hair.</li>
    <li> The opening is too small for my head. I don&#x27;t even have a particularly large head. Useless and too annoying to fuss with returning it. The Ultimate T-shirt towel works much better.</li>
    <li> I recently started hair plopping and have been very pleased with the results. Sadly, I am not coordinated enough to twist a t-shirt around my head while I am upside down battling vertigo :-)&lt;br /&gt;this is great and it makes it so easy. It&#x27;s only $20 what do you have to lose? Go for it.</li>
    <li> Excellently made towel for curly and frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been plopping now with a t-shirt for about a month with amazing results but the t-shirt really bothered me when I slept so when I saw this I was excited to try it. I tried it for the first time the other night and it was way more comfy to sleep in but the results of my curly hair were terrible. Only half my hair curled the other half was just wavy.  I actually went back to a regular t-shirt last night.</li>
    <li> This is just a T-shirt with a string attached to the collar.  It did not do as well as I expected. I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it. A microfiber towel is better at drying my curly hair.</li>
    <li> This product really does work! It leaves my curls looking amazing and not frizzy at all!!! Who would&#x27;ve thought!</li>
    <li> These are great for any type of hair, not just curly or wavy...Even though my hair is thick and wavy with some curls in it, this tee wrap is just wonderful for my hair. I put my styling products in while in the shower with wet hair, wrap my hair in this tee while I put on my makeup..take it off afterwards and don&#x27;t touch my hair, just let it finish air drying.  It has such nice curls afterwards and the more I use it the better my hair gets, and it was in great shape before using this, except now no frizz and soft gorgeous curls. I bought both sizes because I was unsure which one I needed. The medium was plenty long enough, and my hair is just below tops of my shoulders...it is very easy to use, and I can use the longer one if need too !! Great product..</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with this. I&#x27;ve tried several times and can get better curls with my &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; towel.</li>
    <li> This product is great! Woke up with completely dry, smooth and soft, frizz-free hair. I was very surprised. My head was full of curls, even more so than if I let my hair air dry or even use a curling iron, and I don&#x27;t ever wear my hair curly, so straightening this morning was time consuming, but the curls were so frizz-free that maybe I&#x27;ll leave it curly next time. It was tricky trying to figure out how to tie it but definitely worth the challenge! So much better than my old terry hair towel.</li>
    <li> I have a natural wave to my long, course thick hair that I&#x27;ve been straightening forever because I can never make it look soft and curly. But on the rare occasion I have let my natural wave come out, my husband loves it, and wants me to wear my hair curly more often. I was a bit skeptical when I ordered this product, as I&#x27;ve never been able to tame the frizz that ensues if I don&#x27;t straighten my hair. I guess I just don&#x27;t have the patience. Well, I&#x27;m happy to say the Original Curly Tee Towel worked great for me, and I have to believe if it works for my hair, it would work for anyone. I just come out of the shower at night, put on some curly hair products and wrap my hair up in the towel. I sleep with it on all night, and take it off in the morning, and voila, gorgeous soft curls! I couldn&#x27;t believe it! And it is actually quite comfortable to wear sleeping, considering I normally am a fussy sleeper and like to be super comfortable. My husband loves the curls, I&#x27;ve gotten a ton of compliments on my natural &amp;#34;curly hair&amp;#34; so I will happily add this into my hair style rotation.</li>
    <li> The curly towel is wonderful and really does make my hair less frizzy!  The package also came quickly with a hand written note saying thanks for the purchase.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying tighter, less frizzy curls! Very happy!</li>
    <li> Gets the water out and smoothed the cuticle while using on my naturally curly hair. Made of T- shirt cotton and easy to tie on the head. Works better for me than the micro fiber towels I have also used. A word of caution, best when used in dripping wet hair that already has the conditioner and styling product pulled through. I wraparound my sipping wet hair and leave on for 15-20 minutes to eliminate all drips. No need to blot or pat.</li>
    <li> Recently bought this for my 2B-2C hair. I debated whether I should spend the 20 bux on this when I could just use a regular T-Shirt and essentially get the same results. Well im glad I bought this. The ease of use of this makes it worth the money. I &amp;#34;plop&amp;#34; while im in the shower when my hair is still really wet (I get the best results that way) and there is no way I would be able to plop w a T-shirt while in the shower. Im also 31 weeks pregnant and pretty big so bending down to plop w a tshirt isnt easy for me. W this towel I can plop easily in the shower right after putting my hair products in it and not worry about my hair. I put on my makeup while my hair is up in the towel and by the time im dressed w makeup, I let down the towel and my hair has beautiful soft curls (still damp but not soaking wet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I def recommend this to anyone to wants to plop easily without the hassle of having to use an actual T-shirt.</li>
    <li> I love mine. Dries and protect my hair.</li>
    <li> This soft, shaped drying wrap is not damaging and can be tied on your head without flopping or coming undone!  I love that it isn&#x27;t ruining my fragile curly hair!</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing thing I&#x27;ve ever found for my extremely curly hair. I have been using turbine twist for years and didn&#x27;t realize that the towels were affecting my hair so poorly.  I realized years ago that any heat would make my hair terribly uncontrollable and extremely frizzy. I can sleep with this in my hair comfortably and not worry about it until morning.</li>
    <li> Nope nope nope. Did not work for white girl curly hair :(</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry hair any quicker than a towel.</li>
    <li> I am currently transitioning to the &amp;#34;Curly Girl&amp;#34; method, which I won&#x27;t get into the whole method here, but it is one of the reasons I decided to try this product.  Like many people who adopt the method, they eventually learn about the benefits of &amp;#34;plopping&amp;#34;, which involves dropping your shower-wet hair into a t-shirt, non-terrycloth hair drying towel, or other cloth that will not roughen the cuticle of the hair while it is drying.  You then wrap the material around the hair and let the material absorb the water from your hair.  When plopping, you apply your styling products while still in the shower on shower-wet hair, comb through and shape with fingers, then plop.  Leave your hair in the cloth while you finish getting ready, then remove the cloth to either let your hair air-dry or diffuse it.  I decided to try this product to see if it was better than using the long-sleeved T-shirt I had been using.  It is better in some ways, and worse in others.  It is better in that it doesn&#x27;t require a lot of manipulation to tie the wrap to keep it on your head - simply tighten the drawstring and tie the &amp;#34;sleeves&amp;#34; of the wrap on the top of your head as you would if you were using a t-shirt.  It is worse because you do have to manipulate it somewhat to get all of your hair in the wrap in the first place - the opening really needs to be bigger.  A T-shirt is easier to use in this respect because you fold the shirt around your hair, you don&#x27;t stuff it into a small opening. In the end, though, I find this to be slightly easier to use than a T-shirt and will likely buy another to use when the other is in the wash.  I have to believe, though, that if you have been plopping for years with a t-shirt and are skilled at it (unlike me), you probably won&#x27;t find it worth the $20 just to get a drawstring.  As for the product claims about not damaging your hair, keeping it frizz free and healthy, vegan and earth friendly, I find these claims rather annoying because you get the same benefits from a t-shirt that is already in your closet, it is certainly not a unique feature of this wrap.  The only reason to buy this IMO is if you struggle with wrapping and tying a t-shirt so that it stays securely on your head.  For me, it is worth it.  For the vast majority of others, maybe not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE ON 12/23/2015:  I have pretty much stopped using this product, and have switched entirely over to large t-shirts.  Now that I have the technique mastered using a t-shirt, I find that it is simply much more convenient for me rather than using the Curly Tee.  The main reason is, as noted in my original review, that the opening on this is just too small for me.  I find it much easier now to wrap a t-shirt around my hair rather than stuffing it into this product.u get the same benefits from a t-shirt that is already in your closet, it is certainly not a unique feature of this wrap.

    <li> Awkward to put on and tie up, I finally settled on putting it on backward (with the tie in front) which makes it much more manageable.  The smooth cotton material absorbs well enough but really, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my hair texture, ends, strength or relative breakage, between terry towels and this product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really do as much for me as I thought it might.  I only used it a few times and then gave up!</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ve got to be kidding me.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a t-shirt.&lt;br /&gt;It does not dry your hair or itself quickly.&lt;br /&gt;It is extremely awkward to tie.&lt;br /&gt;It does not stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;It is in no universe worth 20$&lt;br /&gt;Should&#x27;ve gotten another by Aquis-the last one lasted probably about 10 years!</li>
    <li> I tried it only once and although it controlled frizz my curls weren&#x27;t as amazing as &amp;#34;plopping&amp;#34; with a white cotton t-shirt.  The way plopping wraps is different that this. I will try it two more times to see if it was just a bad day.  I have to wait until the weekend to try again as my work curls are important.</li>
    <li> Took me a minute to figure out how to use this wrap, but after actually reading the directions I figured it out and happy I did. I really like this hair towel.</li>
    <li> I have really curly hair so I hate towels. They dry out my hair so bad and my husband is tired of me using his shirts to dry my hair lol so when I found this I thought finally!!!! It&#x27;s great to use and even to sleep in. You can tie it many ways and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy the next day ! Best purchase I made 👍🏼👍🏼</li>
    <li> Absolutely no difference than a towel.  I was hopeful but I noticed no difference after using it several times.  I was very disappointed but this is nothing more than cotton cloth.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure when I first read about this hair drying towel, but when I got it and tried it out, it was great! It&#x27;s a little different and a little hard to do the tying part, but as the saying goes, practice makes perfect. My curls stay curly and frizz free once I take off the towel. That I like a lot. I also thought that it would be cumbersome to sleep in, but it&#x27;s actually comfy. Glad I got this.</li>
    <li> Weird shape. Better to just use an old t shirt</li>
    <li> Was like a wet rag on my head and left my hair all floppy.&lt;br /&gt;Useless</li>
    <li> This item looks like a mini t-shirt with 3/4 sleeves, sewed up around the edges pillowcase style, with the neck encasing the drawstring ties.  I wish I didn&#x27;t look so goofy when I wear it, but it does keep hair out of the way and off the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would make it better for me is a heavier weight jersey fabric.  This fabric is a bit too lightweight for me.</li>
    <li> I actually couldn&#x27;t believe how well this works.  But it does.  It&#x27;s all in the fabric.  For the first time in my life, I know how to dry curly hair - never use terry cloth.  With this product, I wash, condition my hair in the shower, hang upside down and comb my hair with a wide tooth comb, and while still hanging upside down slip this thing over my head and flip it back.  Then I get dressed, etc. and then take if off while hair is not completely dry.  At this point, all the curls are completely intact, spiraling all over the place.  I leave it alone, let it completely dry, and then fluff it out as much or as little as I want with my fingers.  Curliest hair I&#x27;ve ever had, without the frizz.  The reason I gave it four stars is because of the design -- too complicated and all those flaps and things I find unnecessary, I think it could be much simpler.  However, that being said I am buying another because it does work.</li>
    <li> This is a curly girl hair saver (I have 3b to3c curls)! I now only feel the need to wash my hair 2 times a week! I used to every other day. This, combined with the pineapple ponytail on top of my head at night, keep my hair looking wonderful for days on end!&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair, put my products in, place this on my head, and go to sleep! My hair is dry after removal in the morning within 30 minutes (air drying).&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I have with it is that it can cause a little of a pressure headache. When I try to wear it looser it comes off in the middle of the night and my hair goes all wonky.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter who has thick, heavy, curly hair.  She likes how it dries her hair and how it stays on her head, but it makes her hair frizzy for some reason.</li>
    <li> I ordered my Original Curly Tee directly from their website and I must say that their customer service was outstanding!    I sent an email asking a few question, regarding if I should purchase the longer one or the regular size.  While waiting for a reply I went ahead and ordered the longer one.  Along with the confirmation email came a note from their customer service telling me that since I informed them that I have mid length, thin, wavy hair, that it would be best if I order the regular one and that they could change my order AND issue me refund for the difference.  I agreed and they sent me the regular size and they issued the refund.  Now that&#x27;s outstanding customer service!  When I received my curly tee, I received along with it a postcard thanking me for the purchase with hand written annotations and smile faces.  Cute little touch.    When I opened the curly tee it was infarct a t-shirt, one like the size of a husky child with no \\&quot;arm\\&quot; openings.  Was I surprised by this? NO BECAUSE I DID MY RESEARCH BEFORE I ORDERED IT!!  So I knew exactly what I was getting.  I thought it was adorable lol.    It takes a little getting used to putting it on but doesn&#x27;t everything at first?    Now keeping in mind that I have blonde, wavy/curly (type 2b/2c), thin hair, the regular size is more than adequate for me, giving ample room to grow out my locks.  I just put my hair through the opening, making sure that the ties are at the back of my head, I tighten the ties to my liking and I flip my head, tying the two \\&quot;arms\\&quot; over and its secure in place.    Now I have not put this on while my hair was drenched in water. I used a microfiber cloth to remove the access water, then I applied all my hair styling products and while my hair was damp, I put the tee on and it did wonders not only for my waives/curls, but I had no frizz...In the instructions it clearly states that you should put on your styling products prior to putting this on.    Now although I have thin hair, it takes a few hours to dry.  I kept the tee on for about two hours and I had to remove it allowing my hair to finish drying naturally and the results were still great!  I don&#x27;t expect this tee to dry drenched hair, those are not realistic exceptions I think.  I also did do a braid in my hair and put this on to go to sleep and although on my first attempt, it did not stay on through the night, I could see the difference on my braided hair, my braid was virtually intact in the morning.    For me, this product is a keeper.  I think the key to any product is doing some research before you buy it so that you know what you are getting beforehand.</li>
    <li> hard to get my full head of hair easily into the product.  it&#x27;s a t-shirt that has been sewn up on the edges except the neck opening.  wanted to love it and use it all the time but i don&#x27;t.  sorry:(</li>
