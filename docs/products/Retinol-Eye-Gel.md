### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is the best under eye gel I have found for under eye puffiness.</li>
      <li>It does what it says; it&#x27;s great!</li>
      <li>Great price too!</li>
      <li>Excellent cream.</li>
      <li>I had another product by this company that was quite good around the eyes.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
      <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS!!!!</li>
      <li>The cool gel feels very good in the AM.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>nothing amazing.</li>
      <li>LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>: This product used to evaporate in the jar, but I found if I leave the seal on top (under the lid)</li>
      <li>I tried it before and saw results so I ordered more.</li>
      <li>Il be buying more</li>
      <li>Love the night cream - verdict still out on the eye cream.  </li>
      <li>Look it up, it even says it removes wrinkles and is safe to use.</li>
      <li>The girl at the clinique counter said moisture is the best and maybe only preventative and cure for wrinkles.</li>
      <li>I have a very sensitive eye area and can&#x27;t use a lot of products, but this is great and does not bother my eyes</li>
      <li>So I used the gel part mostly and it did fine</li>
      <li>It easily takes years off my face.</li>
      <li>Thankfully it goes on easily and there is no residue.</li>
      <li>I think it is too strong for your eye area.</li>
      <li>Price is right and skin fees good and fresh.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>received quickly and as described</li>
      <li>It feels very comfortable on and clearly hydrates around the eyes.  </li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t think it was worth it at all.</li>
      <li>I WISH THERE WAS ONE LIKE THIS FOR SMILE LINES...</li>
      <li>I am using vaseline right now around my eyes and mouth at night and frankly that is better than all I have used so far.</li>
      <li>I believe that this works really well and is worth the money!</li>
      <li>thank you very much.</li>
      <li>I had first bought in in a pharmacy and I can see a bit of an improvement.  </li>
      <li>at 68 my eyes look more open</li>
      <li>If you are looking for anti-aging skin care products at a reasonable price THIS IS IT!  </li>
      <li>This is the first time that I have used an eye gel.  </li>
      <li>I also feel like it helps to smooth down and minimize fine lines.</li>
      <li>When with cosmetic manufacturers we don&#x27;t NEED such strong fragrance added to their products?</li>
      <li>when the beads got on my eye area (which i suspect was pure retinol)</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference after 2 months.  </li>
      <li>Very godd product.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the recommendation from O magazine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the gel every morning and night and really like it.</li>
      <li>It goes on the skin nicely and feels okay, but wow - can&#x27;t get past the NEON blue color.  </li>
      <li>It definitely didn&#x27;t look like a full jar of gel to</li>
      <li>MY EYE AREA LOOKS YOUNG THANKS TO THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
      <li>I always look tired even when I have a good night sleep there</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without this eye gel.</li>
      <li>But I don&#x27;t really know to be quite honest, if it did anything; It could&#x27;ve made it worse for all I know.</li>
      <li>gel itself is lovely and light under the eyes, however it didn&#x27;t help with my bags caused by late nights or my slight wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>For the price and sensitive eye area, I would stay away from this.</li>
      <li>However, as it warns, the serum does make your skin sun sensitive.</li>
      <li>Have seen results on my 60 year old skin.</li>
      <li>I have only used it for two weeks, but I like it so far.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have that tired look any more.</li>
      <li>I recommend to women with dark circles (real dark) and light wrinkles!</li>
      <li>Definitely recommend it over more expensive products I have tried that do not work nearly as well.</li>

<li> Smaller than expected.</li>
<li> I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR A LONG TIME.  </li>
<li> The jar also looked as though it had been opened as the gel around the edge of the white lid inside the jar was dry, gooey and had changed color slightly due to exposure to air.  </li>
<li> I was amazed at how different I look in a few minutes after applying it....</li>
<li> still there using this product for 2 months helped with my dark circles there still there but much less noticeable</li>
<li> I swear the bags under my eyes are less noticeable.</li>

<li> Used Retinol for years and it keeps my skin tone even and gets rid of the little eye and mouth lines.  </li>
<li> It is far to expensive for any results...</li>
<li> I have been using the day cream, night cream, and serum for a few weeks, now.</li>
<li> No more dark circles or puffy spots.</li>
<li> When it arrived the small box which the jar came in looked as though it had been tampered with or used before as the box was ripped.  </li>
<li> In the past I&#x27;ve used eye creams.  </li>
<li> , what I mean is that it at least \\&quot;moisturized\\</li>
<li> Hard to take it seriously.</li>
<li> I have been using it for over a month and haven&#x27;t seen much difference but neither worst.</li>
<li> I have bad dark circles under my eyes</li>
<li> Isn&#x27;t too bad but haven&#x27;t noticed anything yet .</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had first bought in in a pharmacy and I can see a bit of an improvement.  Everything takes time.  I recommend to women with dark circles (real dark) and light wrinkles!</li>
    <li> THIS IS ONE PRODUCT THAT DEFINITELY WORKS.  I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR A LONG TIME.  MY EYE AREA LOOKS YOUNG THANKS TO THIS PRODUCT.  I WISH THERE WAS ONE LIKE THIS FOR SMILE LINES...LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS!!!!</li>
    <li> received quickly and as described</li>
    <li> This product evaporates - I am not kidding you - product disappears.  It is far to expensive for any results...I don&#x27;t care about the color (as some have mentioned) - what I do care about is product quite literally evaporating.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for anti-aging skin care products at a reasonable price THIS IS IT!  Thanks for the recommendation from O magazine.</li>
    <li> I tried it before and saw results so I ordered more.</li>
    <li> I have been using the day cream, night cream, and serum for a few weeks, now. LOVE this product. Have seen results on my 60 year old skin. However, as it warns, the serum does make your skin sun sensitive. The day cream has a sunscreen, but if at the beach, or on the tennis court, I wear a hat and another layer of sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I believe that this works really well and is worth the money!</li>
    <li> The color and appearance of this produce is off putting.  It goes on the skin nicely and feels okay, but wow - can&#x27;t get past the NEON blue color.  Hard to take it seriously.</li>
    <li> When with cosmetic manufacturers we don&#x27;t NEED such strong fragrance added to their products? What are they trying to hide. Would return this if I could.</li>
    <li> Excellent cream. Can sometimes sting your eyes if you get it too close. Would definitely recommend it for keeping wrinkles at bay</li>
    <li> When it arrived the small box which the jar came in looked as though it had been tampered with or used before as the box was ripped.  The jar also looked as though it had been opened as the gel around the edge of the white lid inside the jar was dry, gooey and had changed color slightly due to exposure to air.  It definitely didn&#x27;t look like a full jar of gel to me.&lt;br /&gt;The gel itself is lovely and light under the eyes, however it didn&#x27;t help with my bags caused by late nights or my slight wrinkles.  My eyes however did look a little fresher after applying but that&#x27;s about it.  Its just an \\&quot;ok\\&quot; eye product in my opinion...nothing amazing.</li>
    <li> Isn&#x27;t too bad but haven&#x27;t noticed anything yet . I have been using it for over a month and haven&#x27;t seen much difference but neither worst.</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive eye area and can&#x27;t use a lot of products, but this is great and does not bother my eyes</li>
    <li> I had another product by this company that was quite good around the eyes.  I got nothing out of the Retinol Eye gel.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and goes on smoothly. I have only used it for two weeks, but I like it so far.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected.</li>
    <li> This is the first time that I have used an eye gel.  In the past I&#x27;ve used eye creams.  The retinol eye gel helps the puffiness under my eyes in the morning.  I&#x27;ve been using the gel every morning and night and really like it.</li>
    <li> Used Retinol for years and it keeps my skin tone even and gets rid of the little eye and mouth lines.  Takes care of enlarged pores, age spots and keeps you looking younger.........longer!!!!!</li>
    <li> thank you very much. it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> I have bad dark circles under my eyes I always look tired even when I have a good night sleep there still there using this product for 2 months helped with my dark circles there still there but much less noticeable and I don&#x27;t have that tired look any more. Il be buying more</li>
    <li> My skin drinks this up. I swear the bags under my eyes are less noticeable. I will continue to use this until I&#x27;m 80!</li>
    <li> I can tell the purple under my eyes is lessening as I use this product. It does what it says; it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference after 2 months.  Will continue using the product and I will see.  Thankfully it goes on easily and there is no residue.</li>
    <li> I used one jar. I think it is too strong for your eye area. when the beads got on my eye area (which i suspect was pure retinol) it got all red like bumps on it. So I used the gel part mostly and it did fine, what I mean is that it at least \\&quot;moisturized\\&quot; I think. Anyway it was like $20, I don&#x27;t think it was worth it at all. But I don&#x27;t really know to be quite honest, if it did anything; It could&#x27;ve made it worse for all I know. I will never buy it again, nor would I recommend it either. I am using vaseline right now around my eyes and mouth at night and frankly that is better than all I have used so far. Look it up, it even says it removes wrinkles and is safe to use. The girl at the clinique counter said moisture is the best and maybe only preventative and cure for wrinkles. For the price and sensitive eye area, I would stay away from this. I hope this helped you. May the Lord bless you.</li>
    <li> Very godd product. It met my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent quality.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery Washington satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend This product 100%.&lt;br /&gt;Considers it in my upcoming purchases.</li>
    <li> Esta crema de ojos es maravillosa y a bajo costo. Yo la compre a traves de Sally Beauty Supplies, se ha convertido en mi crema favorita de ojos. Cumple con todo lo que promete, puede competir con las cremas mas costosas y seguiras teniendo los mismos resultados. I love it!</li>
    <li> This is the best under eye gel I have found for under eye puffiness. I was amazed at how different I look in a few minutes after applying it....plus I didnt realize I had such puffy under-eyes until I started using this and seeing myself without the puffiness! It easily takes years off my face. I also like the cooling effect it has on my eyes, it&#x27;s soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: This product used to evaporate in the jar, but I found if I leave the seal on top (under the lid) it prevents its it from evaporating.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 years.  It feels very comfortable on and clearly hydrates around the eyes.  Great price too!</li>
    <li> at 68 my eyes look more open</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this eye gel. No more dark circles or puffy spots. I also feel like it helps to smooth down and minimize fine lines. The cool gel feels very good in the AM. Definitely recommend it over more expensive products I have tried that do not work nearly as well.</li>
    <li> Love the night cream - verdict still out on the eye cream.  Price is right and skin fees good and fresh.</li>
