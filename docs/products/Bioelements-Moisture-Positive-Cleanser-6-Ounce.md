      <li>The item was well packaged and arrived safely.</li>
      <li>My favorite cleanser, cleans without drying, moisture without feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>My favorite cleanser.</li>

      <li>and I love it...</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather, it&#x27;s more like a cream</li>
      <li>Love it and will continue to use.</li>
      <li>I contacted the seller: Authentic Skin Care.  </li>
      <li>excellent cleanser for very dry skin.</li>
      <li>I have been very pleased with all their products and decided to try their Moisture Positive Cleanser.  </li>
      <li>It apparently is a huge risk to purchase items on Amazon</li>
      <li>Not overly oily, but leaves my face feeling clean.</li>
      <li>but my skin feels so clean and refreshed after.  </li>

      <li>I use Bioelements crucial moisture afterwards, and my skin feels amazing.  </li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin that dries out easily with cleansers, sun, make up, etc.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very concentrated so it does not require a large amount to get your face clean.</li>
      <li>I very much like this creamy face wash.</li>
      <li>Authentic Skin Care finally relented and said I could return the item at my expense and they would charge me a restocking fee.  </li>

      <li>It has done a great job of cleansing my dry skin without drying it further.  </li>

      <li>Bioelements Moisture Positive Cleanser works for me.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for many years and would recommend it for anyone with dry skin.</li>
      <li>I have to really watch what I use on my face.  </li>
      <li>Ok, not very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I just purchased another bottle this month, and tried it-it seems nice and thick, like I am used to.  </li>
      <li>Perfect if you have eczema, rosacea and/or troubled, dry skin.  </li>
      <li>I was first introduced to Bioelements when I had a facial.  </li>
      <li>Authentic Skin Care made this experience a huge disappointment.  </li>
      <li>skin is soft and moist after use... and I combine it with a Bioelements Cruisal Moisturiser..</li>
      <li>Have used other products (Dermalogica) much more expensive and not any better.</li>
      <li>This product was recommended by my esthetician and I bought it the first time at the salon before I found it for much less on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Other cleanser especially in the winter,  burns when I apply cleanser Moisture Positive Cleanser</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve spent so much money on facial products and I keep coming back to all Bioelements products.  </li>
      <li>the cleanser is very watered down.  </li>

    <li> I have used this product for a long time . I have very dry skin and this keeps my skin moist and clean.</li>
    <li> Ok, not very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This product arrived unsealed.  Looked as if it had been used.  I contacted the seller: Authentic Skin Care.  They would not respond until I contacted Amazon customer service to complain.  I had a bad reaction to the product and Authentic Skin Care refused to stand behind the product.  I also indicated that I had received this item unsealed.  Authentic Skin Care finally relented and said I could return the item at my expense and they would charge me a restocking fee.  Authentic Skin Care made this experience a huge disappointment.  Many of my friends purchase on Amazon, so I decided to give it a try.  I doubt I will be making future purchases on Amazon.  It apparently is a huge risk to purchase items on Amazon</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to Bioelements when I had a facial.  I have been very pleased with all their products and decided to try their Moisture Positive Cleanser.  It is definitely a great cleanser.  Your face will be noticeably softer and smoother with regular use.  And the price is very fair.  It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for many years and would recommend it for anyone with dry skin. It&#x27;s a gentle cream cleanser that leaves your face feeling fresh, soft and clean. It&#x27;s very concentrated so it does not require a large amount to get your face clean.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and it removes all make-up including waterproof mascara.</li>
    <li> I have adult acne and very dry skin in the winter.  I have to really watch what I use on my face.  Bioelements Moisture Positive Cleanser works for me.  Other cleanser especially in the winter,  burns when I apply cleanser Moisture Positive Cleanser doesn&#x27;t .  I&#x27;ve spent so much money on facial products and I keep coming back to all Bioelements products.  For me they are the best.</li>
    <li> I love this whole line. Not overly oily, but leaves my face feeling clean. I use this with the crucial moisture nightly</li>
    <li> Have used this cleanser for several years.  It has done a great job of cleansing my dry skin without drying it further.  This line of products is excellent.</li>
    <li> This is the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used, and have been using it for about 5 years now.  It doesn&#x27;t lather, it&#x27;s more like a cream but my skin feels so clean and refreshed after.  I use this with a clarisonic cleansing brush everyday.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my already dry skin.  I use Bioelements crucial moisture afterwards, and my skin feels amazing.

    <li> Perfect if you have eczema, rosacea and/or troubled, dry skin.  A little goes a long way. It&#x27;s been a go to for years.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin that dries out easily with cleansers, sun, make up, etc. this is the best cleanser to use. I can use this twice a day without an issue. I use on my eyes with a tissue or cotton ball to remove eye makeup, no problem. I love this cleanser!!</li>
    <li> This works well as a cleanser, but dries my skin a bit.</li>
    <li> have been using this product for a number of years and I love it... skin is soft and moist after use... and I combine it with a Bioelements Cruisal Moisturiser.. now, if I could just stop aging ;) ha!</li>
    <li> I know this product and love it--this is a great price, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try from Amazon.
