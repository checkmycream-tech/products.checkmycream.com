    <li> Very good lime smell.</li>
    <li> Excellent scent in soap making</li>
    <li> Having returned after over half a year overseas, I found  a package from Eden&#x27;s Garden waiting for me from  last year. I had written\\&quot;\\&quot;One bottle(lime) was almost completely empty making for a fragrant envelope., the second bottle(tangerine) had 20% leakage and only the third bottle(spearmint) arrived intact. Very shoddy packing job, unworthy of contents which were otherwise fine\\&quot; and given one star. I give 5 stars belatedly, the replacement   products were excellent and I am completely satisfied  and would order again from this supplier who had quickly remedied the problem.</li>
    <li> Natural smell.  Perfect for sugar scrub ingredient.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of citrus. One day I will use these oils for soaps and lotions, when I have time... But for now, I enjoy them rubbed into my skin. They do not last long on the skin, as with most essential oils. so I will have to find something to extend it.</li>
    <li> I love this oil!! It smells wonderfully and mixes perfectly with the lemon.</li>
    <li> Once again, very pleased with the quick response of the seller Eden Garden &amp; the delivery of a quality product. I use essential oils in potpourri and as misting a room. The 100% Lime Oil was just what I wanted for that citrus fragrance. Citrus is the best for freshening up a room. I recommend this seller for anyone who wants a resource for quality products. Thanks to Eden Garden &amp; Amazon.com</li>
    <li> LOVE LIME! Perfect for winter weather</li>
    <li> I previously purchased a set of assorted smells from the same company and seller and although I LOVED all of the scents, I found myself gravitating toward the lime bottle a little bit more, so I purchased a larger bottle of the same scent. I friggin&#x27; love it. I heat it in my warmer and sprinkle some on my pillow on occasion. It gets my juices flowing.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, helps with mental exhaustion when used with bergamot oil in a hot oil diffuser!!</li>
    <li> This item works as it is said to.  Also have had very good luck with items ordered from Edens garden.  They stand behind their products and shipping issues.</li>
    <li> Holy poop!  I was using another brand in my drinking water.  I was assured this was the same grade.  Nope.  FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY.  I felt like I drank lighter fluid (though I really haven&#x27;t ever tried that.)  My eyes are old and can&#x27;t read fine print but I will ask a kid to read labels before I drink something again!</li>
    <li> the perfect lime scent for my margarita theme bath salts</li>
    <li> Excellent oil and excellent seller!!</li>
    <li> Edens Garden offers great oils and below the price of most other brands.  This one has a great scent. To date I have used it in air freshener and in a lotion.  Awesome. I will definitely purchase more oils from Edens Garden.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of lime. I rub two or three drops on my palms most mornings and them rub it on the back of my arms. It is a wonderful pick-me-up.</li>
    <li> Lovely smell of lime.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and as always shipping is very fast.</li>
    <li> I do not know if I like it, yet, as it arrived shattered.</li>
    <li> Lime is ok. Cinnamon makes it where you can&#x27;t breathe and almost need to call 911.</li>
    <li> smells great!  Love Eden&#x27;s Garden and the prices they have on their Essential Oils.  Makes it affordable for most families looking to make changes in their health and natural living</li>
    <li> Intoxicatingly vibrant scent.  LOVE diffusing this stuff in the winter.  I apply it to the soles of my feet before putting on my work boots for a boost in the morning.</li>
    <li> Edens Garden has awesome oils at great prices !</li>
