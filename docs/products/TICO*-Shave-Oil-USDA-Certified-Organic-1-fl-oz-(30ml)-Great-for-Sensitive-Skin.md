      <li>Travel Friendly for your carry-on.</li>
      <li>Man you sure are obvious about reviewing your own product.</li>
      <li>There are many all natural shave oils out there that are thinner and smell better.</li>
      <li>Smells amazing - certainly not overly floral or musky, but actually kind of herbal and even minty?</li>
      <li>Their website/blog thingamagig is full of how to help the world,</li>
      <li>Super clean shave.</li>
      <li>It provided a very smooth shave, absolutely NO razor burn, and a really nice moisture afterwards.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and very Earth friendly.  </li>
      <li>This stuff will clog your razor quickly though, it is an oil after all.</li>
      <li>Super close shave.</li>
      <li>The container dispenses the right amount for me and the bottle will last a fair amount of time.</li>
      <li>This is a very thick oil and not the best smell in my opinion.  </li>
      <li>One squirt is all it takes to get as really close and comfortable shave.  </li>
      <li>Pricy but worth it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the time to learn to shave in the shower, by the way</li>
      <li>I can also clean up my lines better than with regular shaving cream because the oil is translucent.  </li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s just all agree that Tico is as good as a shaving aide can get and move on to other ventures.</li>
      <li>The moisture from the shower keeps your beard very soft and easy to shave.  </li>
      <li>Tico* is the real deal!</li>
      <li>my face thanks you!</li>
      <li>Fantastic natural shaving oil.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it I was sold.</li>
      <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>
      <li>Ok, not 42 but several....</li>
      <li>Usually I can&#x27;t get a good shave unless I go two days without shaving, not with TICO</li>
      <li>I really believe it is far superior to shaving cream, and it takes up a lot less space in the shaving kit when I travel</li>
      <li>Too much comes out with each pump.  </li>
      <li>or my face stays very oily.  </li>
      <li>Works with Straight Razors, Safety Razors and Cartridge Razors.</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>It clogs razors and is a real pain to wash out.</li>
      <li>Thank you Tico for creating your own path instead of following he standard men&#x27;s shaving formula.</li>
      <li>I kept a beard from high school on.  </li>
      <li>All natural, organic and responsibly sourced.</li>
      <li>Dead cool container, also dead handy</li>
      <li>When TICO* came out, I ordered a bottle - just to support this new upstart...</li>
      <li>They recommend hot/warm, I prefer cold, still works great.</li>
      <li>The razor zips along with less friction and the mild fragrance lingers</li>
      <li>I have used several shave oils in the past and TICO* is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>No more time should be spent trying to make a product better than this.</li>
      <li>Note that I bought my present supply direct from Tico, before this product was listed on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Because of that reason, I decided to use as natural products as possible in regards to soap, shampoo, tooth powder and shaving cream/oil.  </li>
      <li>It is a rather thick oil like another reviewer mentioned, but it leaves your skin extremely smooth.</li>
      <li>There is tremendous rise in auto immune diseases in western world lately including vitiligo.</li>

    <li> This stuff is MONEY! Never going back to shaving cream again. Using this product with a single blade safety razor is the way to go. No nicks. No razor burn. No ingrown hairs. No breakouts. Super close shave. TICO*... my face thanks you!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product!!</li>
    <li> I have used other shave oils and Trico is the best. A good sense of protection when shaving and no lingering smell afterwards like some do. Pricy but worth it. Must try to appreciate</li>
    <li> Wife only likes this for AFTER shaving. It is atrocious for use during shaving. It clogs razors and is a real pain to wash out.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST shaving oil in the world. I purchased this and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. The first time I used it I was sold. NO razor burns. Super clean shave. Usually I can&#x27;t get a good shave unless I go two days without shaving, not with TICO I could shave 2-3 times a day and not get razor burn. I have told everyone I know about this stuff. I will definitely buy more. It lasts a long time too.</li>
    <li> Best product on the market that eliminates the need for a separate shaving cream and aftershave....its all in one and not is works better for both uses but does it with all organic ingredients.  It scares me to think what all the chemicals in shave gels and aftershaves are actually doing to the health of my skin.  Thank you Tico for creating your own path instead of following he standard men&#x27;s shaving formula.</li>
    <li> The reason for my  choosing TICO Oil was simple. Lately, studies are getting published  in regards to us killing \\&quot; good bacteria  ( particularly Nitrosomonas bacteria )which are crawling on our body with soap and shampoo. There is tremendous rise in auto immune diseases in western world lately including vitiligo. Because of that reason, I decided to use as natural products as possible in regards to soap, shampoo, tooth powder and shaving cream/oil.  When I started using TICO , I found it  little uncomfortable for the first few days while shaving , but I kept using it and  after using for a month, I don&#x27;t think that I will go back to shaving cream again. The product is costly and that is the reason I gave four star.</li>
    <li> Amazing product.  If you haven&#x27;t tried it, give it a shot.</li>
    <li> The only stuff to use. The best. Simply. I use it daily, for 3 pass shaves. Works with Straight Razors, Safety Razors and Cartridge Razors. No need for brushes, scuttles, bowls. Or multi-coloured creams/soaps that seem to smell strongly of said colours! Also no need for moisturizer/aftershave balm. This oil does that. All you need is water. They recommend hot/warm, I prefer cold, still works great. Dead cool container, also dead handy, one squirt has the right amount of drops, Good for travel too. Has all the good things people like these days. All natural, organic and responsibly sourced. FDA approved. Thing is, these guys, the producers, actually mean it, they&#x27;ve been kinda living the life, which was what prompted the product. Their website/blog thingamagig is full of how to help the world, indigenous peoples and all that. Anyway the stuff is great. If all of the other Bonds had used this stuff, Sean Connery&#x27;s accent would&#x27;ve been par for the course with all of them. I recommend it to all ages and sexes. (although, I might panic and use a little extra myself if a woman came up to me sounding like Sean Connery).</li>
    <li> These guys have done it. They perfected shaving cream/lotion/oil. No more time should be spent trying to make a product better than this. You will be wasting time and money. Let&#x27;s just all agree that Tico is as good as a shaving aide can get and move on to other ventures.</li>
    <li> Fantastic natural shaving oil. Love it!</li>
    <li> Fantastic for shaving and even just as a moisturizer. Love this product. Easy to use, good for the skin... and all around good product.</li>
    <li> TICO gives me the smoothest shave possible.  It&#x27;s easy to use and very Earth friendly.  This is a great product.</li>
    <li> I have used several shave oils in the past and TICO* is my favorite.  Great product and packaging.</li>
    <li> I loved using Tico shave oil!!  It provided a very smooth shave, absolutely NO razor burn, and a really nice moisture afterwards.  I found that my legs felt so luxurious after using Tico shave oil that I didn&#x27;t want to use any other moisturizers.  Do yourself a favor and give it a try.</li>
    <li> I used to use other oils from well known shaving companies, but was concerned about the chemicals in the contents. You can&#x27;t go wrong with TICO. Even if you never used a pre-shave oil and looking to start, this is a great product to start - and stay with. I&#x27;ve been using them since they started and won&#x27;t use anything else. The container dispenses the right amount for me and the bottle will last a fair amount of time. Glad to see an organic product like this out there. I am very, very pleased with TICO.</li>
    <li> This is a very thick oil and not the best smell in my opinion.  Too much comes out with each pump.  I have to wash it off after or my face stays very oily.  Does not absorb well.  There are many all natural shave oils out there that are thinner and smell better.</li>
    <li> A lot of these reviews are also on the website, so I was skeptical about ordering the product. Nevertheless, I decided to give it a try. Well, it&#x27;s amazing and I highly recommend it! It is a rather thick oil like another reviewer mentioned, but it leaves your skin extremely smooth. Two cons I have with using this product are that it is so thick that it clogs my razor, so I&#x27;m considering switching to 4 blades, and I need two pumps instead of one..so I don&#x27;t know about this product lasting for the claimed &amp;#34;125+ shaves&amp;#34;. Maybe half of that for me. But I am using Tico to shave my legs &amp; bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than those two things, it&#x27;s a great product! No itchiness or irritation afterwards!</li>
    <li> For some time I have used Tico not only in the bath for a shaving oil for my legs but also cosmetically for my décolleté.  Boasting its natural ingredients, I no longer have a need for expensive cosmetic creams.  Tico is an all-encompassing product.</li>
    <li> Good stuff and good for your skin. Buy more hemp!</li>
    <li> Man you sure are obvious about reviewing your own product.</li>
    <li> Cant be just me? The oil stings/burns your eyes which no shaving oil has done to date... looks like one of these  two ingredients to my untrained eye...... &amp;#34;Spearmint Essential Oil (mentha spicata) Organic Peppermint Essential Oil&amp;#34;?  ...why would you enjoy anything on your face while shaving that irritates your eyes so why others love and it bothers mine is confusing...</li>
    <li> I always hated shaving.  I kept a beard from high school on.  Then I found TICO Shave Oil.  BLAM!  Now I don&#x27;t hate shaving...  I am able to not be super scruffy because I will shave that area I like to call &amp;#34;the neckbeard&amp;#34;.  I can also clean up my lines better than with regular shaving cream because the oil is translucent.  Whether shaving my whole face, or cleaning up my awesome beard, I always use TICO.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tico Shave Oil exclusively for a few months now, and it is a wonderful product.  I really believe it is far superior to shaving cream, and it takes up a lot less space in the shaving kit when I travel (can go in a carry-on too).  One squirt is all it takes to get as really close and comfortable shave.  It&#x27;s worth the time to learn to shave in the shower, by the way (I&#x27;ve been doing that for more than 50 years).  The moisture from the shower keeps your beard very soft and easy to shave.  Try just one bottle of Tico.  I&#x27;ll bet you&#x27;ll become the repeat customer I am,  Note that I bought my present supply direct from Tico, before this product was listed on Amazon.  Having it available on Amazon makes it all the better.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t duplicate this blend if I tried! Nice shave oil!</li>
    <li> I have switched to using shave oil (rather than gel) around 5 years ago, and have tried several brands. When TICO* came out, I ordered a bottle - just to support this new upstart... And have never tried anything else again.&lt;br /&gt;TICO* is very light, refreshing, and ensures a very smooth shave.</li>
    <li> The absolute perfect product for shaving, Tico* shave oil smells great and is not at all greasy. It also contains many&lt;br /&gt;wonderful organic based ingredients which leaves my skin feeling good. Moisturiser is not needed at all after using&lt;br /&gt;this oil. The design of the bottle is excellent as well, if you have tried shave oil before and liked the experience you will&lt;br /&gt;love Tico*</li>
    <li> Ok, not 42 but several....Pretty great product all around. I got a sample of another shave oil when I ran a race many moons ago.  That company went out of business and I was ELATED to find this TICO product.  Worth a try - totally a better way to shave and the best thing is....Travel Friendly for your carry-on.</li>
    <li> Really lovely stuff. Smells amazing - certainly not overly floral or musky, but actually kind of herbal and even minty? Just great. I use it and so does my husband. The texture is thick, not thin and runny like some oils. Makes my legs feel like BUTTAH!</li>
    <li> Its pretty good, I like it better than creams and gels. I have thick facial hair and struggle with ingrown hairs. While it has not helped with the ingrown hairs, it definitely makes shaving less painful and irritating. This stuff will clog your razor quickly though, it is an oil after all.</li>
    <li> Tico* is the real deal! When I shave with shaving cream - it&#x27;s a shave. When I shave with Tico* - it&#x27;s an experience. The razor zips along with less friction and the mild fragrance lingers so I can skip the aftershave.  Oh yeah, I almost forgot, there&#x27;s no alcohol burn too.  My wife also loves the stuff and raves about the low-impact packaging.</li>
