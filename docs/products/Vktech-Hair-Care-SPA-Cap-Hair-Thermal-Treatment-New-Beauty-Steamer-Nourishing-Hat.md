      <li>cap didn&#x27;t get warm enough.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really liked this</li>
      <li>it is warm.</li>
      <li>My hair feels warm when I take it off.</li>
      <li>Well, warm is better that not working at all, I guess?</li>
      <li>What else can you say it&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>It is recommended to improve control of the temperature, there are more levels of heat.</li>
      <li>but It did the job in an okay time...</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I took a chance.</li>
      <li>save time and your money and get something better.</li>
      <li>This is really amazing, like it wasn&#x27;t HOT</li>
      <li>I leave it on for about 45 minutes and its warm but not uncomfortable at all.  </li>
      <li>but it does the job fine.</li>
      <li>I had great anticipation and received just the opposite.</li>
      <li>But came right on time!</li>
      <li>, like Cool Mist&lt;br /&gt;(Off Brand/Generic)&lt;br /&gt;Never, again</li>
      <li>I wanted to use it for a full stream treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
      <li>so if u want something quick and easy then this is for u.it doesn&#x27;t get too hot in fact it doesn&#x27;t get hot at all.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s cheap so don&#x27;t expect too much out of this product.</li>
      <li>It was cheap and got here really fast</li>
      <li>Im natural and love it</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t get warm enough.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get super hot</li>
      <li>It took almost 2 mos to come and it doesn&#x27;t even get hot enough to keep a infant warm</li>
      <li>but I would not mind a deep condition cap as well just to be safe</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t get too hot -</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t get hot enough could of achieved better results with hair blower.</li>
      <li>first of all it took almost a month to get to me.. and when it did get to me, it did not even get hot.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t really get that hot</li>
      <li>This thing is ridiculous looking - but with a deep conditioning product to use with it, it works awesome.  </li>
      <li>It would be nice  if it got a little warmer.</li>
      <li>I received this product after reading about it and really wanting a steam cap..</li>
      <li>I like it, it heats up fast &amp; it had an adjustable strap.</li>
      <li>no instructions and doesn&#x27;t heat very well</li>
      <li>Other than all the instructions being in Chinese and not English, it a great heating cap for the head.</li>
      <li>never worked refused to send back to China was worth it</li>
      <li>the cord is pretty short.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t go far once you have plugged in ...</li>
      <li>was a little disappointed that the cap does not get very hot, on the highest setting at best</li>
      <li>so doing the job for deep condition treatments on my natural hair.</li>
      <li>I like the color or heats up ok not great</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t heat properly, you can barely feel any heat.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it works, it just could stand to get warmer. but It did the job in an okay time...</li>
    <li> Terrible,I guess you get what you pay, for!&lt;br /&gt;And, instructions weren&#x27;t in English.&lt;br /&gt;More, like Cool Mist&lt;br /&gt;(Off Brand/Generic)&lt;br /&gt;Never, again</li>
    <li> This is really amazing, like it wasn&#x27;t HOT but it was warm enough that when I took it off, the air felt so cold. I really liked this and I&#x27;m glad I took a chance.</li>
    <li> Does not heat up and enough and the instruction are in Chiniess</li>
    <li> I really hate this s***, this has a bit of warmth and it reminds me of a sun of winter.</li>
    <li> Great for the price. It would be nice  if it got a little warmer.</li>
    <li> I had great anticipation and received just the opposite. The cap does NOT even warm up. I will do what my sister did. I will use the pink bonnet as a storage basket.</li>
    <li> I received this product after reading about it and really wanting a steam cap..&lt;br /&gt;WELLLL first of all it took almost a month to get to me.. and when it did get to me, it did not even get hot. WTH I was so disappointed after waiting so long. I wanted to return but seller told me to keep it... No recommendation here,,, BAA HUMBUG BLAHHHH&lt;br /&gt;God Bless and happy shopping!!!!</li>
    <li> all instructions is in Chinese ?????  Even google could not give me a proper way to use it.</li>

    <li> Great price and cute cap.&lt;br /&gt;I was a little disappointed that the cap does not get very hot, on the highest setting at best it is warm. Well, warm is better that not working at all, I guess?</li>
    <li> I wanted to use it for a full stream treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve a salon steam cap before.&lt;br /&gt;This cap didn&#x27;t get warm enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fall below the way I thought it would work!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> For the price, it works great and does the job it needs to do. It doesn&#x27;t get super hot you don&#x27;t realize you have it on until your deep conditioner may run from under the cap. Other than all the instructions being in Chinese and not English, it a great heating cap for the head.</li>
    <li> This was awful came dirty like it was used already,never worked refused to send back to China was worth it so I threw in Trash.</li>

I put two shower caps on and then the bonnet. Overall I like it but I would not mind a deep condition cap as well just to be safe</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get warm enough.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product but I never received it, I contacted the company and I haven&#x27;t heard anything yet. Also I noticed that the price went up since last week when I ordered it was $9.99., all the other reviews say that it doesn&#x27;t heat up, if I ever receive this treatment cap I will up date my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received product but haven&#x27;t tried it yet, company was real good about replacing product.</li>
    <li> This product is the worst.  I purchased 1 for myself and one for my sister.  It does not heat up and I guess you get what you pay for.  I want a refund but it came from china and I don&#x27;t know how to send it back.  Both caps!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this hat spa cap its great  for steam.. Im natural and love it.. just add water  and moisture your hair will feel good</li>

    <li> This thing is ridiculous looking - but with a deep conditioning product to use with it, it works awesome.  Doesn&#x27;t get too hot - I leave it on for about 45 minutes and its warm but not uncomfortable at all.
