      <li>I don&#x27;t like dark blush and felt like I looked forever for a blush like this that goes on very light and is easy to add more if you want it darker.</li>

      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Pink Lift blush, but I like Maybelline&#x27;s Dream Bouncy blush a bit better, because it takes less product to give good coverage, and the price is better for the amount of product you get.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know, maybe I don&#x27;t have the right &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34; for this?</li>
      <li>I turned to Amazon to track down my favorite and was pleased to find it there.  </li>
      <li>It blends right in, and if you want a little more color, all you have to do is layer on a touch more where you want it.</li>
      <li>Please get more back in stock!  </li>
      <li>Ihave been using this product for several years now and just love it....</li>
      <li>One jar was full and normal.  </li>
      <li>I really like it</li>
      <li>You do not need much.</li>
      <li>am very dissapointed that the company decided to change this product for another crem blush...</li>
      <li>a fresh, completely natural-looking glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this has much color to it at all in spite of the photo.  </li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t have to worry too much about looking like a clown with this blush.</li>
      <li>though I do get VERY tan over the summer)</li>
      <li>/&gt;The small, light case is easy to carry in a purse, and I had no questions getting through airport security with it because it&#x27;s not a liquid or</li>
      <li>A creamy blush is much better for older skin, use it when you need to add color to your cheeks, it doesn&#x27;t settle into the pores like other cream blushes</li>
      <li>blends easily and seems to stay much longer then other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I live in a very hot climate and have left this in my car with no problems.</li>
      <li>Other than that service was fine.</li>
      <li>I do not like Maybelline&#x27;s new version of this product.</li>
      <li>Will have to look for a new one, when this one runs out.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the new version</li>

<li> within like an hour it&#x27;s all gone :(</li>

    <li> Great color….smooth application….lasts all day</li>
    <li> This I bought every one I could find on the internet.  Stays one and looks great.  Unfortunately they are removing it from the market that is why I bought all I could find.  I don&#x27;t like the new version...wish they would bring these back.</li>
    <li> This inexpensive blush covers quite well. The mousse like quality makes it easy to put on and if you get too much coverage you can easily take some of it off before it sets into your skin. The Cloud Wine color is a good true wine and if this is the color of blush you wear, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. I use this in conjunction with Revlon&#x27;s Mousse rose petal (#25). The two blend well to produce a graduated cheek color.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed personally.  I don&#x27;t think this has much color to it at all in spite of the photo.  I also thought it was kind of sticky feeling.  I will use it, but I won&#x27;t purchase it again.  Too expensive for what you get too.</li>
    <li> The new Dream Bouncy is like wearing nothing - loved the old blush - used it for years.&lt;br /&gt;I will look for something else.  To bad.&lt;br /&gt;Sue</li>
    <li> Wish Maybelline still made this! happy to find it  though the cost was steep.  Excellent condition just as advertised. Happy</li>
    <li> It is smooth and creamy and easy to apply.  This is one of my favorite  colors. I thought Maybelline discontinued making it ---- Hope I was wrong because I really do love this blush.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for would by this again.  This is all I have to say about this product.  I like it.</li>
    <li> Maybelline has replaced this mousse blush with something new that has the feel of chewed bubble gum and slides out of the jar.  Ick.  I am buying all of this I can find. The color is perfect for me, I have used it for many years and never found anything I liked as much.  It has no orange under tones, somehow my skin grabs the orange in any other product.</li>
    <li> Really love this blush.  Goes on nicely and blends flawlessly.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a darker pink color.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t have to worry too much about looking like a clown with this blush. It&#x27;s easy to control your application. A nice blush.</li>
    <li> When Maybelline retired this blush and replaced it with an inferior product I was dismayed.  I turned to Amazon to track down my favorite and was pleased to find it there.  Have placed two orders for six each.  Price and response time were excellent, hope they don&#x27;t run out of this blush for a long time.</li>
    <li> I like this Blush because it is a smooth satin finish that goes on easily.  This is a great blush.</li>
    <li> I love this and wish I could get more of it in the 50 cloud wine color.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great to give you soft, pretty, and rosy cheeks. I use it as blush when I wear lighter clothes and in Spring. I don&#x27;t like dark blush and felt like I looked forever for a blush like this that goes on very light and is easy to add more if you want it darker. It&#x27;s also really nice because it can get knocked around in your purse and doesn&#x27;t get powder everywhere. I live in a very hot climate and have left this in my car with no problems. I like to wear blush very lightly, and this stuff has lasted me 5 years interchanged with the bronze color that I have for when I wear more dark-colored outfits and in fall. I am going to buy more colors to try out too!</li>
    <li> I ran out.  Please get more back in stock!  Easy too apply.  You do not need much. Love this color.</li>
    <li> Gives your cheeks a healthy glow! I recommend this product to those who want to keep their skin  moist and not dry or cakey.</li>
    <li> My mom has been using this product forever and has tried several different ones and always buys this when its available. I was very excited to buy it on Amazon since it is very hard to find right now.</li>
    <li> I think the cream blush got this way due to it being shipped in extreme heat.  So I didnt send it back - too much trouble. But the color is good and goes on great.  I think I just got a bad one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I suspect the shipping in this 100 degree heat&lt;br /&gt;was the culprit. But the cream goes on great - so doesnt seem to deter the quality it just looks bad when you get it. I&#x27;ll order again in the fall .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is wine and not red or too pink - just perfect.</li>
    <li> Maybelline Dream Mousse Blush in Cloud Wine is a great, natural-looking color for me. Although it seems to be quite dark in the package, it goes on beautifully. It blends right in, and if you want a little more color, all you have to do is layer on a touch more where you want it. The finish is so soft, I really love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad news is I&#x27;ve heard that Maybelline has discontinued this product, and I am both disappointed and FURIOUS! Maybelline.... What are you thinking? Please bring this product back!</li>
    <li> Love this blush. Sorry it&#x27;s been discontinued. Will have to look for a new one, when this one runs out.</li>
    <li> LOVE this blush!!!  Soft and creamy, it goes on my skin like butter, but doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or pasty, and gave my cheeks a fresh, completely natural-looking glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small, light case is easy to carry in a purse, and I had no questions getting through airport security with it because it&#x27;s not a liquid or powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Pink Lift blush, but I like Maybelline&#x27;s Dream Bouncy blush a bit better, because it takes less product to give good coverage, and the price is better for the amount of product you get.</li>

    <li> Too bad Maybelline has replaced this product with a far inferior one, Dream Bouncy.  I love the Dream Mousse Blush and was glad to find it on Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> My usual, only this one was expensive!  I may have to find something else.</li>
    <li> Love the # 50 &amp; 40 Dream Mousse Blush, as its So much smoother &amp; lasts longer then powder blush! Mush more effective!</li>
    <li> I ordered two jars.  Both were sealed.  One jar was full and normal.  The 2nd jar was shrunken inside and only about half the amount.  Other than that service was fine.</li>
    <li> I love the color, and it goes on so smooth...gives you a nice creamy finish to your total look.&lt;br /&gt;I am very dissapointed that the company decided to change this product for another crem blush...the new product is very hard to blend.</li>
    <li> A creamy blush is much better for older skin, use it when you need to add color to your cheeks, it doesn&#x27;t settle into the pores like other cream blushes</li>
    <li> This blush is creamy and gives your skin a natural sun kissed color!&lt;br /&gt;I  used to find it locally, but they no longer stock it.  glad to find it here.</li>
    <li> I love this product  but they don&#x27;t seem to make it anymore. I do not like Maybelline&#x27;s new version of this product.</li>
    <li> So glad somebody had this. I was very sad when they quit making it. I scooped up two at the same time. Will order again soon.</li>
    <li> I really like it, I think it looks nice with my complexion (I am somewhere between beige and white...though I do get VERY tan over the summer) unfortunately this wears off SO quickly! I put it on in the morning and within like an hour it&#x27;s all gone :( I don&#x27;t know, maybe I don&#x27;t have the right &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34; for this? My skin is normal (not oily or dry) so I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s the problem. But the color is very very nice!</li>
    <li> The shipping was awesome and the make-up was nice and new very happy with this product I advised this  product for any person who does everyday make-up</li>
    <li> It seems that the store don&#x27;t care this shade of Maybelline Dream Mousse Blush.  I was delighted to have found this at Amazon.  I&#x27;ve order several so I won&#x27;t run out anytime soon.</li>
    <li> Good product &amp; value.</li>
