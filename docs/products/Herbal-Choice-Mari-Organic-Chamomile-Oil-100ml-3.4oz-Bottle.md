      <li>I usually absolutely love Herbal Choice&#x27; products.</li>
      <li>Smells mostly like olive oil.  </li>

      <li>This is olive oil, not smelling any chammomile, which completely defeats the purpose of buying this.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells like olive, can&#x27;t detect the chamomile</li>
    <li> I feel perhaps because I bought a larger size, I tend to sacrifice some quality.  However, it still smells pretty good and I have used it in candles with success.  Would probably buy again.  Hard to gauge true scent as chamomile is a soft/not potent scent.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> nice and relaxing oil ! I put a couple drops in a tub and soak I just adore the relaxation I get from using essential oils. great product.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately , I am not satisfied from this product as when buying it I didn&#x27;t see it&#x27;s mixed with olive oil and I noticed that when received it. Basically it&#x27;s olive oil mixed with something supposedly chamomile...</li>
    <li> The product is very nice and came right on time.  I was under the impression that it was pure chamomile oil but perhaps should have checked the product better -- it is in fact chamomile dissolved in olive oil.  So I can&#x27;t use it for my diffuser but it is an ideal product for the skin and hair.</li>
    <li> Having never tried this company before, I am quite impressed.  I would recommend this to others looking for a quality essential oil.</li>
    <li> All you smell is olive oil. It really needs to say olive in it&#x27;s title, the product is misleading.</li>
    <li> ...Actual ingredients are lost in the description near bottom of page.  Amazon should require sellers to produce images that show ingredient list, as it is printed on the product labeling.</li>
    <li> I am not sure about this, as I have not used it.  My mistake. I thought it was pure chamomile oil, but the primary ingredient is olive oil.  It is all organic though.  This was my error, not the company.</li>
    <li> was kind of rancid, but I missed the deadline to returnit. Too bad, b/c I usually absolutely love Herbal Choice&#x27; products.</li>
    <li> Do not like the smell. Did not find it moisturizing either.</li>
    <li> Do not say Chamomile oil when it&#x27;s mainly ingredient is Olive oil. Misleading and dishonest advertise!</li>
    <li> I wish I reach the reviews, as I too feel deceived. I thought I was buying an essential oil, but it does seem that it&#x27;s mostly olive oil, because I can&#x27;t detect the chamomile. :(</li>
    <li> Great quality of oil! ! I will definitely buy again.  Fast and efficient shipping all together what a joy! !</li>
    <li> This is olive oil, not smelling any chammomile, which completely defeats the purpose of buying this.</li>
    <li> Since the label says organic chamomile oil, that is what I expected, so I feel misled. Also, I expected the scent of chamomile. The one thing I do like is that it is practically non-everything bad for you. However, if I wanted a combination oil, I would have just added chamomile to a non-smelling carrier oil like grape seed. It&#x27;s too much of a hassle to send back, so I will use it, but never buy again.</li>
    <li> Great item and as described. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This is kind of just olive oil, from what I&#x27;ve seen. I don&#x27;t notice any sort of significant changes in my skin/hair that I didn&#x27;t receive before when I would use olive oil. However, it still appears to be a high quality oil and does what it&#x27;s meant to do. It smells like olive oil though so if you&#x27;re expecting the smell of chamomile (like I did) you&#x27;re perceptions are inaccurate.</li>
    <li> I just finished my first bottle of chamomile oil and already have another on the way. So many amazing uses and the smell isn&#x27;t too strong&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have eczema and have been looking for a natural remedy. This does wonders. I also use it to add highlights to my dark blonde hair. And if you sleep with it (and shower the next am) it makes a huge difference in color and hair health</li>
    <li> Very small percentage of actual chamomile oil.  Smells mostly like olive oil.  I am super disappointed</li>
    <li> Chamomile exact in an oil base, smells good and works with what our family needs</li>
    <li> I have this in my makeup drawer.  I use it for the following: Hair treatment.  A day before you are going to wash your hair or morning of (if your an evening bather) I put a light coat on my hair and wear it up so it doesn&#x27;t look so greasy.  My hair feels so nice after I wash it out.  My daughter loves it too.. Nice for the scalp as well.  Sometimes I just slap it all over my face before I got to bed  Use instead of hand lotion  Put on a cotton ball and remove stubborn make up.</li>
    <li> The scent is faint. It smells more like EVOO than chamomile.</li>
    <li> Good essential oil. I used this for some camomile lavender bath salts and they were a huge hit. You can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
    <li> Shame on them for calling this Chamomile Oil. It&#x27;s like they put in two drops of actual Chamomile and filled the rest up with olive oil. You&#x27;ll be sorely disappointed with this if you bought it for aromatherapy uses like I did.</li>
    <li> Misleading, it&#x27;s mostly olive oil, very little chamomile oil.</li>
