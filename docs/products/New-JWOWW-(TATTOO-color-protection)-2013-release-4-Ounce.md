<li> but it&#x27;s not too harsh either.</li>
<li> It does okay, just has an awful smell to it.</li>
<li> the worst thing about this how thick it is and doesn&#x27;t mix with others.</li>
<li> Worst tattoo lotion / balm / cream ever.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this, it is great for my tattoos. My tattoos still look fresh after using this product.</li>
    <li> I thought it was purchasing a tanning lotion with tattoo color protection. This product is very sticky and it is made to put only on your tattoos. Maybe i did not read the description correctly but it wasnt what i was expecting.</li>
    <li> It does okay, just has an awful smell to it. I did receive that bottle sealed so it let me know I was getting what I ordered.</li>
    <li> pretty good, i will find out how good when i go back to the tanning beds :)</li>
    <li> I was under the impression that this was sunblock. It&#x27;s not. It just \\&quot; protects your tattoo\\&quot;. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Buy a good sunblock, it&#x27;s cheaper than this.</li>
    <li> My tattoos still look bright after tanning. It does its job!</li>
    <li> Worst tattoo lotion / balm / cream ever. Stinks like playdough (yes, I said playdough) and doesn&#x27;t enhance the tattoo as much as over the counter lotion.</li>
    <li> protected my tattoos!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few of JWow&#x27;s lotions before, so I was very excited to try this out. You get a large amount of product in the bottle, which is very nice. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell, either. The issue that I had with it is that it&#x27;s not as easy to use as the sticks, as it is harder to control where the product goes, and it&#x27;s easy to use too much.</li>
    <li> Kept my skin soft and did not cause any pore blockage</li>
    <li> Its sun screen. Not sure if it has extra protection then any other out there but I like it.</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for two years, this one isn&#x27;t really that good. It tells you on the back that you need to put it on 20 minutes before tanning, and it doesn&#x27;t smell good at all. the worst thing about this how thick it is and doesn&#x27;t mix with others. It takes forever to rub in and after it feels like it&#x27;s coming off.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully and I love using it.</li>
    <li> Love it! Brings out the color in my tattoos and protects them so well. It does not smell so great but it&#x27;s not too harsh either. K would recommend to anyone who wants to tan and has tattoos.</li>
    <li> very very good!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite sunscreen</li>
    <li> i have lots of tattoos and my half sleeve is still so colorful thanks to this product, i have been using for 3 months</li>
    <li> I have several tattoos that I put this on and it seems to keep them bright when I am tanning.</li>
    <li> Other then the smell, I really enjoy this product.</li>
    <li> This lotion adds extra moisture to my tattoos and problem exzema spots.  I apply it after my regular tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> Nice product&lt;br /&gt;Prime was on time</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not scented, it goes on nice and is not oily. I put it on always about 10-20 minutes prior to going tanning. My tattoos are still nice and vibrant.</li>
    <li> The scent is amazing and the color protection actually works!  It is definately a product that I will order again.</li>
    <li> I believe this has/had a expired expiration date on it!.... Seems to work good but doesn&#x27;t go on good (almost like its expired and rubs on thicker/ harder to rub in).</li>
    <li> Seems to work my tattoo has not faded and still looks new.</li>
    <li> For now I&#x27;m satisfied of the result</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks. It&#x27;s not oily and has no smell. It&#x27;s pink in color and rubs on clear. So far I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
