<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product use it twice a week! Makes my skin smooth and clear!</li>
    <li> My mother has the product and it&#x27;s absolutely amazing! Best mask I have ever used</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S MUD .....NOT THAT GREAT.....</li>
    <li> Product expires way too soon compared to if i want to buy it in a store...... Other than that the protectection seal on pack was danaged. Over all the product is good but again it expires way too soon.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Left my skin feeling firm, not dry and feeling very fresh and clean.  Definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> I just got this &amp; used it &amp; I&#x27;m already in LOVE!! First, the texture is amazing. It feels like a mix of mud &amp; clay, but goes on your face really smooth. It&#x27;s like an at home spa treatment really! When you rinse it off it isn&#x27;t hard to get off like some masks can be. And your face feels refreshed afterwards. I&#x27;m looking forward to using this product more!</li>
    <li> I used this one trying and seen the difference my face is so soft and smooth. I recommend this if you looking for a quality mask.</li>
    <li> Love how my skin feels and looks  after this mask. The Effects last for days..great value!</li>
    <li> I think its an overall OK value product that does the job. The jar is indeed huge though which gives you the bang for your buck. When I applied it my face, it left a nice cooling feeling. However, the drying up process of the mask was a little itchy, but that can simply be because of the tightening.It&#x27;s a little hard to wash off so I advise using it before showering for convenience. It didn&#x27;t seem to affect my skin tone, but it did leave my skin nice and soft as well as slightly clearer looking. I will look forward to trying this product on other rough patches of skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product:) It feels good when its on my face and then just as good after the mud mask is taken off and it leaves my skin super  smooth!!</li>
    <li> Great price and product!</li>
    <li> I had heard great things about dead sea mud masks and decided to try it. . My skin is very sensitive and didn&#x27;t react well to this product. It made my skin soft which I love but I also broke out after using it and it didn&#x27;t help with making my pores smaller.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality product at a great price.  While I originally purchased it to apply to my knee and foot for arthritis pain, when I saw the quality, I began using it on my face as well.  I got more than I paid for!</li>
    <li> When I received this mud mask I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it, I got a discount to review this product and only paid a dollar! It is wonderful! My face feels so fresh and clean also super soft.</li>
    <li> Left my skin feeling very clean and soft. Didn&#x27;t have any weird smell. I had to apply a thick layer though which lead it to not dry as quick to be a mask. Took a few more minutes to dry. Not oily at all which is a good thing. It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> great quality, have tried some that are practically dried out prior to receiving them. Not the case with this one. Size is great for the price as well!</li>
    <li> I like the way my skin feels. It really exfoliates the skin. The product is uncented and has an earthy smell which is really good and natural.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This mud mask feels cool, creamy, and refreshing when first applied to the skin.  After drying and rinsing, it leaves the skin moist, supple, clean, and firmed, and neither oily nor dry.  I use it before bathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask has a beautiful deep grey color from the mineral-rich Dead Sea mud, which is blended with a few botanic and mostly organic ingredients to condition and protect the skin:  shea butter, jojoba oil, aloe vera juice, calendula oil, and hickory bark extract.  It has only a slight earthy fragrance and can be used even by people with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large tub holds a full pound, and I estimate that it will provide me with at least twenty facial treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emagine Products provided mud mask for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> The bottle is huge! At first when I tried the mask it was really cold, but that&#x27;s just because it sat outside several hours at night before I opened it. I put on the mask before hopping in the bath, I soaked for a bit, scribed my body, shaved my legs.... and by the time I was done with my regular routine, the mask was super dry &amp; tight, so I washed it off using my regular facial cleanser. When I got out of the bath, my face was still feeling tight.... and for a couple days after, my skin was still feeling tight!!</li>
    <li> Its not like you get a tremendous changes in your skin, as a face mask this is one of the best. It smoothen the skin. Takes off black heads. Works as a exfoliator. I didn&#x27;t see change in skin tone but I just felt very clean and smooth skin. It just balanced out my skin.</li>
    <li> Really great mask and great price for the quality. AND, the tub is HUGE.  It goes on nicely, dries pretty quickly and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth! I have only used this product twice so far but I am loving it.  I have super sensitive skin so I was a little skeptical (as always) to try a new product.  After using it twice I have not noticed any excess dryness or any irritation. It definitely improved the quality of my skin.</li>
    <li> IT WOOOORRRRKKKKSS!!!! Sorry everybody, but my skin needed...something and I&#x27;ve tried so much. This made my pores so teeny tiny after two weeks!!!! JUST TWO WEEKS! It&#x27;s pretty easy to put on and I leave it on for about 15-30 min  depending on how fast its drying. Washing it off is a bit of a task, but most definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Feels so good after I use it! 😊</li>
    <li> I have sadly developed adult acne, something I have never deblt with. It has been frustrating going through so many products with no results or worse. Well, this is the first and only thing that has worked. I use it twice a week and in just 3 weeks I notice a HUGE improvement.  I was so happy with this product I literally just ordered their rose hips serum. I try to use mostly or all organic products and this has not disappointed.  Best money I have spent on my skin.  Thank you VoilaVe!</li>
    <li> I still have the same amount of blemishes as I did before but my skin definitely feels better.</li>
    <li> This face mask is amazing!! it does not dry your face out like a lot of masks do that i have tried, It leaves your face felling very refreshed after using, DEFINITELY will be buying again</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference after the first use! My skin felt tightened and more smooth  the first time I used the Dead Sea Mud Mask. I noticed less wrinkles and a more even tone, and better complexion. I can&#x27;t wait to see what will happen after regular use!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smooth an I&#x27;m not unhappy with it , but I was look for something more Like a clay , muddy product .</li>
    <li> I love this face mask! I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s and I have developed mild acne in the last year. I&#x27;ve tried many different products including Bioelements, dermalogica, and Kiehls and this mud mask beats them all. My skin is looking so much better after using this 3 times per week. My pores are a lot smaller, my skin is looking younger and my acne is almost completely gone!</li>
    <li> This is so amazing and wonder for your skin. THis is a must have in my skincare and you need it in yours as well. My daughter even used this and it helped with her skin. She had a few pimples and it cleared them up right away.</li>
    <li> This really made my skin smooth and didn&#x27;t cause dryness like others I&#x27;ve tried. I also liked that this wasn&#x27;t perfumed. The texture was great and dried quickly and rinsed away easily without leaving a residue.</li>
    <li> This Dead Sea mud may be suitable for some customers, but it was not what I wanted, needed, or expected.  I thought I was purchasing pure Dead Sea mud without other added ingredients.  I needed the pure mud to incorporate into my soap batter.  The amount of oils and butters in it offset my recipe ratios of oils to lye and I had to throw it away because my soap would not harden properly. I ended up losing money by utilizing it. The man from the company was very kind to reach out to me to see if I was pleased, but understood that it was not the right product for my business.

    <li> This was a great product. It felt so good on my face during my relaxing bath times. The jar is huge, I won&#x27;t be running out anytime soon.</li>
    <li> This mud mask is great. It has almost no scent, it&#x27;s easy to apply and dries quickly. No irritation. Makes your skin super soft. No dryness or redness. Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Bright. Clear. They work.</li>
    <li> tHIS WAS GREAT LOVED  THE WAY THIS MADE MY FACE FEEL THANK YOU SNAGSHOUT.COM</li>
    <li> Wife used it said her skin felt good after</li>
    <li> I like this facial mask, it feels good on the skin and is easy to use (no mixing needed), as to the benefit, I will need more time to see results.</li>
    <li> This mask feels very soothing with a slight tingle on the skin. After washing off, my face felt rejuvenated and very soft! Also, for the amount you pay, its a fantastic deal for the amount of product you get. I am very satisfied!</li>
    <li> It has been a long time since I have used a mud mask, but I am glad I tried this one.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and leaves it feeling soft and fresh!  I love it!</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t say this is a bad product. I gave it two stars because it didn&#x27;t work for me. I have extremely sensitive skin, and it caused me to break out and had red splotches. If you have sensitive skin, you may want to find something else.</li>
    <li> This mask just wasn&#x27;t for me, personally it would burn my face even if I used it for only 10 minutes (within the guidelines) and use after use I did not see any difference in my skin. I bought it because of all of the good reviews but I suppose I&#x27;m just one of the unlucky ones. It was very expensive as well, I bought this tub for $39.95 but they have since lowered it to $22.95 which seems a little more reasonable.   Being upset with my purchase I noticed they had a 365 day money back guarantee and they refunded me! Customer service is very important and they were so friendly with me. I am definitely willing to give their other products a try.</li>
    <li> This came very fast with my prime membership. I tried it as soon as I received it today. I noticed my pores already became smaller and it only takes a little bit so this will lady for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Great mask! My face feels so soft and clean! Took a while to dry.</li>
    <li> Feels really nice...I like that. It does take a long time to dry.</li>
    <li> Mask left my skin feeling very soft! I really like that it had some oils in it to moisturize while purifying through the Dead Sea mud. Very nice gel like consistency. Easy to spread on so it didn&#x27;t cake too thick. Definitely pulled a lot of crud to the surface!</li>
    <li> Thought this would be a miracle product but was not. Actually seems to cause breakout rather than help. I stopped a few days then started again and I break out. Gave a good 30 days to see if needed time but no good and now I am past the return date and stuck with it. Going in garbage.</li>
    <li> luv this mud...iam based in india..orderd it on amazon to b delievered to my newyork adress...its superrb!!!... leaves my skin soo soft lovely n bright...wud def . order it again!!</li>
    <li> I like this product.  The best part is that I don&#x27;t have to mix it because it already comes prepared.  Left my face feeling clean and smooth.</li>
    <li> great job at purging and tightening skin. Pores are reduced in size.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in late February and just realized, in July, that it expired on March 15th. Of course, now it&#x27;s too late to return it.</li>
    <li> I love it .It stops break out makes my skin feel smooth. My husband uses it after shaving and it helps with his razor bumps.</li>
    <li> Leaves your face feeling fabulous. After a few uses I noticed a difference in my skin as well. Less dry spots</li>
    <li> VoilaVe Dead Sea Mud Mask - I recieved this on a promotion to try and I am glad I did. I have tried other dead sea mud masks as I am very interested in all natural skin care. This particular formula I like best so far and the reason is that not only is it all natural but the manufacturer has created a formula that takes into consideration additional benefits with a moisturizing base. Most of the dead sea mud masks I have tried were really pretty basic - dead sea mud combined with either purified water or an oil base for spreadability.  This formula goes well beyond that with a all organic ingredient list that has multiple benefits to your skin such as - Shea butter, sunflower oil, Aloe Vera, jojoba oil, hickory bark extract etc. The dead sea mud pulls impurities out and exfoliates while the other ingredients leave your skin feeling fantastic.  Very soft and refined.  The package is so much nicer then the typical &amp;#34;homespun&amp;#34; look you so often find with all natural facial care lines - VoilaVe has obviously put a lot of thought into the labeling design which is attractive and upscale as well as has informative content. The overall appearance of the product is very nice and I would be happy to give this as a gift. They also sent a bonus E-Book on skin and hair care which was a nice surprise.  This is quite a large quantity of product, a full 16 oz which I think is fantastic for the price especially considering its so much more than just the basic mud mask you find elsewhere! Super nice - good job VoilaVe</li>
    <li> So far I am loving this. It made my skin as smooth as a baby&#x27;s skin!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this Dead Sea mud facial mask!! I used it for the first time this weekend with my nephews, and we had a fun mud mask night!! The kids had fun with it, and my 12 year old nephew is convinced he needed softer skin since he is a pre-teen now, lol, so he was excited to see the results! I personally have used lots of masks and this one was great because it wasn&#x27;t too thick, but it was definitely purifying. It made my pores smaller so I was impressed with that!! Overall would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Love it!!! It was packed up tight and safe, but I have prime right now lol it came fast and it looks like the pic, actually it&#x27;s alot more then what I thought it would be! The container is very heavy and filled to the top. It has no smell, and it goes on your face very easy. I let it all dry and when I washed it off I was shocked at how soft my face looked, my y where just about gone( they where very clean and my black heads were just about all gone to what I could tell). And my face had a different glow to it.i really am happy with this purchase and I would definitely recommend! It is a big difference from my clay mask I use and the other mud man I have.. The only bad thing i have to say is if you had to pay for shipping it might cost alittle more than what you would think cuz of the weight but other then that, don&#x27;t be afraid of what it looks like and use it!</li>
    <li> AMAZING mud mask. Shrinks pores and cleans my face.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I am a big fan of Dead Sea Mud and this one is far the best one. After you wash your wash with this mud mask your face feels softer and smoother. It is not pasty like some mud mask it&#x27;s smooth and smells good. I use it everyday and so far it has been a good product. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> The first time I ised it my face was a little itchy . But after that it was fine . The mask has no smell which I was surprised. It does make for face look healthier . I like it so far</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical to buy this facial mask but when I read buyers reviews and experiences using this item I was convinced to give it a try. I can say that it really tighten my pores, expoliates, makes my face soft and lighter. I liked it and I would definitely get more after I finish mine.</li>
    <li> I  really like this product. It did not make my face feel tight as it was drying. It was easy to clean off and left my skin feeling smooth. I did need to apply a bit of moisturizer after my face dried.</li>
    <li> goes on easily and washes off cleanly quick</li>
    <li> I just received my mask today and finally got to try it out and it made my skin feel super clean, it made it a bit dry afterwards but I just put a little lotion on and it made it super soft. So far I absolutely love it! I got it for a super discounted price from snagshout.com too. (:</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this mask. Nice amount contained in the jar, great value! I love how it goes on, nice and smooth. Can feel it drying and pulling impurities out of the skin. Washes off easily and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean. Soft and I think fewer wrinkles. My sister had some places on her back and I put the mask on them for 20 minutes. When she washed it off some of them were flattened! Very impressive. I intend to keep this stuff to use a few times a week. It&#x27;s a new addition to my beauty regime. At almost 60 I can use the help! This stuff rocks!</li>
    <li> I used this facial mask for the first time today. I was so excited to try it. After a hot shower, and a freshly washed face, I slathered the Dead Sea Facial Mask on all over my face avoiding my eye and mouth area. After about 15mins I washed it off. It wasn&#x27;t irritating,but as any other facial mask as it is drying it is a little uncomfortable while wearing. After I washed it off I noticed immediately that my pores were much smaller and my skin was tighter and radiant! It also made my skin smooth! I am now hooked! I love this mask!</li>
    <li> Love this! It leaves my skin feeling clean and soft! Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> After using this mask my face felt very clean. I was a little scared from other experiences with mask that it would over dry my skin but it didn&#x27;t. It is a huge container so you can get a lot of uses out of it.</li>
    <li> I got it and it is a large jar. Which is great, I applied it to my face and when it started to dry my face got really itchy. I rinsed it off in the shower and followed up with my normal cocoa butter soap. My face feels really clean and it looks bright so I guess all the itching means that its working. I&#x27;m happy with it and its going to last me a while since its such a big jar. It also works as a body wrap, just use plastic to wrap it up.</li>
    <li> Arrived sooner than I expected and in excellent condition! Huge container so that&#x27;s always a plus! I love this mud mask, it always leaves my skin soft and fresh. I have no complaints. I received a discount promo code for this product and this review is of my opinion based on a consumer&#x27;s point of view.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife through snagshout and she said it was &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34;.  She said she didn&#x27;t exfoliate first and that would&#x27;ve made the difference.  She said it made her skin feel somewhat smoother and it felt &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Like with any mud mask it is going to be drying like I expected with this product. You will need to use a moisturizer after the mud mask. I do like that it removes excess oils &amp; impurities to allow my skin to better absorb moisture. Also it&#x27;s 100% natural and it helped me with redness in my face. I will be using this mask about once a week!</li>
    <li> Dead sea mud facial is very nice! I&#x27;m not use to facial mask but this left my face,feeling very soft, and my nose had a little shine to it, after 2 hours of my face feeling face tight. I did not notice any unusual scent, and directions are very easy for applying. Only thing I can recommend is to do this right before you shower as it is difficult to remove completely by using the sink.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! When I buy a face mask I am usually disappointed about the amount, often I am left conserving the mask to make it last another time. This is a huge bottle so you don&#x27;t have to worry about that here. It smells and feel really, very earthy. I love it.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, your own spa, in a jar! Luxurious after use feeling and look, thanks!</li>
    <li> Felt very good on my face. I have only used it once but will check back for a more thorough review later</li>
    <li> Very good product and conforms to specifications and seller fast handling and confident and very suitable prices</li>
    <li> Yeah, wish I could say it is the best but its just &#x27;OK&#x27;. No better, no worse than others.  Good value, however!</li>
    <li> Overall pretty good product</li>
    <li> Great, I like it! My skin is feeling nice!</li>
    <li> I love this dead sea mud mask. I have several different ones and this one is just as good as the others. It makes your face super soft after application. I like to put it on 5-10 minutes before my shower, then rinse while showering. This helps keep the mess down, and is much better than trying to rinse it off in the sink.</li>
    <li> Gee what can I say about this....it&#x27;s remarkable.  It may look creepy but it works magic on your skin. I have to order a lot since I do not just put it on my face. The whole body get this product Even my hair.  Summer time after a day in the sun shower and soak this in your skin shower again and you will feel like a new person!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this mask, it has no odor, and all you need to apply is a very thin layer, otherwise it will take longer to dry, during the drying process I felt my  face getting tighter, and after I rinse it off I felt my skin smoother. I definitely recommend this mask, I got it under a promotional offer but I will pay full price for it, it will last you a long time, so definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I do like the mask cause easy to use, clean your skin very good and won&#x27;t take too long to dry out...thank you!!!</li>
    <li> This masks works great. You can really feel it working. The only negative aspect of this mask is it&#x27;s consistency. The gel mud type of mixture does not allow a even application. You are left with gel rather than mud in many places.</li>
    <li> came with big air bubble and less than weight indicated</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about two months on my African American skin and it has been great! Lately, I have been breaking out with adult acne, and this product has definitely helped it remain minimal. I definitely feel as though it sloughs away a lot of the dead skin and gives my skin the appearance of looking youthful and vibrant. I definitely recommend the product!</li>
    <li> After trying the eye cream from this brand, I was very excited to get to test out their mud mask. What I loved about the eye cream is that not only is it effective at smoothing the fine lines and reducing the look of dark circles under my eyes (I have a baby), but it also felt gentle and nourishing on my skin. I was delighted to find that the mud mask is just the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this out on a day when I was having some hormone related breakouts, hoping the mud would draw out the oils and reduce irritation. I have tested another brand of mud mask in the past, and felt it very effective, but also very harsh to where the rest of my skin felt overly dry after using. I&#x27;m delighted to report that this mask felt like it replenish the moisture in my skin even while balancing the oily spots. I really liked how smooth and baby soft my skin felt afterwards. It is nice to have products that are effective without stripping or drying the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a sample for testing, but the opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Lovely product. Makes me feel like I&#x27;m at a spa</li>
    <li> I have Rosasea and I can&#x27;t have anything on my face without a reaction!  I am 51 yrs old and there is only one product that I can handle up until now....WOW....thank you so much Voila Ve...I am in almost in tears because to have something finally that not only can my skin tolerate your product but for it to feel cool, comforting and soothing is a blessing!  You have a gold mine....keep up the GREAT work!  I am a life time fan!!!</li>
    <li> Great product. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love it feels so good on my skin and makes it smooth No bad smells</li>
    <li> I have used this product 5 times since I purchased it and it makes my skin feel incredibly soft after each use.  I am not a fan of exfoliating but I look forward to using it.  I feel like it is cleansing and extracting all of the impurities out of my skin making it look brighter after each use.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Made my face feel really soft and purged the oils out. Was pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> Fun and pampering. Felt rejuvenated after</li>
    <li> this mask is awesome! it left my skin feeling so clean, you could actually feel it tingling as it dried, but it does leave your skin kinda tight and dry so think about having a moisturizer on hand after use just in case you have the same outcome.</li>
    <li> I love these products!!! I just received my Mud Mask the other day and already I have received compliments on my skin. I have used many of the VoilaVe products and I can&#x27;t say enough good things. My skin has never looked better even at my age!!!! I use the Vitamin C serum at night along with the Rosehip oil. In the morning I use the Vitamin C serum and then the Hyaluronic Acid Serum and finally the Rosehip oil. Skin looks great!!! Very happy with these products. Thank you VoilaVe!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product, makes my skin so soft and had removed fine lines and also helped with sun spots.</li>
    <li> The clay looks like jelly the first time you see it, not the typical clay you see from other masks. I have huge pores on my nose and cheeks, which I&#x27;ve been hating---that&#x27;s why I got this in the first place. So here&#x27;s my review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could feel it tightening your skin when it&#x27;s drying and when you&#x27;ve rinsed and pat your face dry, you definitely feel cleansed. However (why I&#x27;m giving this a 4-star), it left my face dry, especially my cheeks, so make sure you use a moisturizer (oil is the best moisturizer, and I&#x27;ve only paired argan oil with this mask). The pores on my cheeks became smaller the first time I used it, but the pores on my nose were still there, but that&#x27;s most likely due to my proneness to blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, good product, a little expensive, but if you only use this twice a week, it&#x27;ll last you a very long time. You just need a thin layer over your face and make sure you spread it evenly so it&#x27;ll dry evenly.</li>
    <li> I would this mask!!! I&#x27;m hooked and purchasing more for family and friends as a present.</li>
    <li> great service and product..... very pleased with both~!!</li>
    <li> Great Mask!  All the ingredients are natural and help my adult acne! Redness has gone away and leaves my skin refreshed, not dry.  Even though a little more expensive. I found this is much better than the Queene Helene Mint Julep Mask which uses Bentonite clay. This also does not have parabens, which the other clay masks do.</li>
    <li> I love this so much I bought it for my sister and got a good friend to get it too.  My face feels softer, more glowing and sunspots have faded.  I think I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month.</li>
    <li> This product meets my expectations. My skin feels smooth after I use this product, but it expires in 5 months. I hope the expiration date could be longer.</li>
    <li> Feels great after using.</li>
    <li> Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels great on my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin feeling so smooth and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very reasonable price and generous size for such a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coleen E.</li>
    <li> I really like this mud mask. It has a pleasant yet earthy smell, and left my face feeling moisturized and rejuvenated.</li>
    <li> This is so nice.  Just try it for yourself and you will, hopefully, experience what I mean.</li>
    <li> dried up my face really bad</li>
    <li> I was actually shocked at the size of this jar when it showed up! It&#x27;s huge! This mask will last you all year and probably beyond, and that&#x27;s if you use it a couple times a week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love using any product that contains mud from the dead sea. I&#x27;ve used several over the last few years and have been nothing short of impressed. I love the Voila Ve brand so I was really excited to try out their dead sea mud mask. Mud masks are fantastic for pulling out impurities and toxins of the skin, and mud from the dead sea, from my experience, is very hydrating to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved using this mask and tried it out a couple times over the last few weeks. It&#x27;s super easy to apply, and you only need a little bit. After about 10 to 15 mins, I could feel it start to dry and tighten.  It&#x27;s not uncomfortable in the least but it&#x27;s nice when you get busy doing something else, the mask lets you know when it&#x27;s done! I&#x27;ve also used other dead sea mud masks and they can take some work to rinse off, but my Voila Ve dead sea mud mask came off quite easily, even when it&#x27;s very dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, I noticed a nice difference right away. Although I have dry skin and you start to feel the mask tighten when it dries, you are left with very moisturized, soft, and supple skin. I applied my moisturizer afterwards, and that was it! My face felt amazing and seemed to have a really great glow to it too! I loved how moisturized my skin really did feel after using too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love a good mask and for the prize and the size of the jar you absolutely can&#x27;t beat the value. I love products made from the Dead Sea, and this Voila Ve mud mask was absolutely fabulous! This is something I would certainly continue to use many, many more times and recommend to anyone who wants a great mask that will give your skin a good clean and leave it feeling amazing!</li>
    <li> I love this mask for my sensitive skin it really makes my skin look lighter and smooth at night thank you.</li>
    <li> I use this mask once a week after a microdermabrasion (home kit).  My skin looks fantastic and tight the next morning.  I also have seborrheic dermatitis and this product has done more for my condition than anything my dermatologist has prescribed for me.  I truly love it!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking to shrink pores Queen Helen&#x27;s mask outmatches this by far. Didn&#x27;t do anything that mask couldn&#x27;t do either.&lt;br /&gt;This is a splurge but nowhere a necessity</li>
    <li> Just started  using this product,so far I&#x27;m very satisfied. I will  order again.</li>
    <li> I am in love with everything mud!  Well for skincare needs that is.  About two months ago I tried a mud mask and while I loved it, I couldn&#x27;t get over the stinging burning sensation it kept leaving me.  And though it did leave my skin all nice, smooth and hydrated, it still always felt like it was burning my face.  After a closer look at the ingredients I realized that it contained eucalyptus oil which is a known irritant for the skin.  After finding this information out, I realized I would have to discontinue the use of that dead sea mud mask in order to avoid irritating my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However nothing like VoilaVe to save the day!  The reason while I love VoilaVe so much is because they actual have quality skincare products that are not only packaged right but they are formulated correctly.  Also, this mask is certified organic which means all the products used in this mask natural.  I received this product about two weeks ago and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.  When I open this jar, the first thing I noticed was just how big it was.  It came in a 16oz jar.  The consistency of it is very creamy and smooth and the color is a dark green.  I took a knife and mixed it well in order to make sure it applied to my face evenly.  It went on pretty smooth and a little went a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left it on for 15 minutes and used it twice a week.  I noticed that I had no burning sensation whatsoever during the whole time I had it on.  I did brace myself for the pain, but it never came. Thank goodness for that!  It dried to a nice hard but soft texture. So I was still able to talk, somewhat without my face cracking and falling off.  After I washed it off my face, I noticed it came off easily with no green residue left behind and no tightness to my face.  It left my face feeling well hydrated.  I honestly was in love with the glowing results this left me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask is 99% organic and natural. It has only one unnatural ingredient which is xanthan gum. However beforeyou go running for the hills, the majority of all skincare and body care products have xanthan gum in it. This product is mostly used in order to help thicken the product and allow it to glide on smoothly.  It is considered safe for personal use and can be found in many different items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final note worth paying attention to. Since this mask is 99% natural and organic, its best you keep it in the fridge.  The majority of the dead sea masks that are organic and natural lack the properties needed for a long shelf life, which is good.  The reason why a lot of skincare products can last the dawn of time is because of all the crap and/or chemicals contained in them.  So in order to ensure that your mask stays fresh and last awhile, keep in the fridge and NEVER in your bathroom where the constant drastic change in temperature will affect it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I truly love this mask and it is now my holy grail and top number one in masks!  I would for sure recommend you give this mask a try if you want to use real dead sea mud that is natural and organic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, I have really been enjoying all of VoilaVe products so far and can say that I have slowly but surely been swapping out many of my skincare items for this company&#x27;s&#x27; products.  I am truly satisfied with the quality of their products and how well formulated them are.  VoilaVe is for sure taking over my skincare routine and bathroom vanity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep Smiling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dayana</li>
    <li> I was amazed!! After the first use, I could see visual proof that the product was all the manufacturer said it would be. I recommend this product along  with their other &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; products.</li>
    <li> Great product and a great purchase for the money.  I would defiantly purchase this again...</li>
    <li> Once it starts to dry it gets really itchy, after rincing it off skin Does feel softer have saw somewhat of a reduction in pore size</li>
    <li> I had never tried this kind of mask before and I absolutely love it! My face is combination, oily in some parts but dry in others. This mask refreshed my whole face and evened it out to where it looked great! I highly recommend this mud mask, especially if you&#x27;ve never tried it before. It does not irritate your skin like others do. Wish I had this in high school!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product</li>
    <li> Love this product. I use a different facial mud mask, which was incredible, so decided to try this. I applied it to my face and I was pleasantly amazed that this mask does what it is supposed to do. Leaves my face feeling fresh and clean. I&#x27;m the one who has sensitive skin, but this is not harsh at all. After only one application my skin is baby soft, more toned and appears lighter. My pores seem smaller. I have a healthy glow for at least couple days.  I feel that my complexion is clearer, and this mask does not leave my skin dry. Now I use this Dead Sea mud on my face once a week and I absolutely LOVE it. I received a sample of this product in exchange for a honest and unbiased review. All opinions are based upon my own experiences with the product.</li>
    <li> VoilaVe contains organic high quality ingredients that work wonders. It comes with a free guide that can guide you as you using it. It can be used on the face and the body. It takes about 10 -15 minutes for the mud mask to dry. After rinsing it off, my skin felt refreshed and tightened . It came off easily. The formula is certified organic so your skin is getting the best of the best. The actual mud is rich in consistency and is like a dark green color. The product is worth every penny and it comes in a 16oz container! If you are new at trying mud mask, then I really recommend this one for you, it has organic ingredients , it comes in a large quantity, and it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love this mud mask.  It removes impurities and gets rid of acne with one use and tightens skin while it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple nights ago, I smoothed on a healthy amount of Voila Ve Dead Sea Mud mask to my face and allowed it dry. After twenty minutes, I rinsed my face and it instantly felt softer and smoother. My acne disappeared and my skin felt tighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask can also be used to remove rough skin on elbows, knees, and feet. It draws out skins impurities for healthy, clearer, brighter skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus!! Voila Ve came with a free ebook that you can download immediately from their website.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite things to do with my skin is to give it a facial. Dermatologists recommend it once a week, but with my sensitive skin I usually only do a facial once a month. I have been looking for a really good mud mask for a while. I prefer mud or clay, as I do not like the peel off kind they always get stuck on my face. I was delighted when VoilaVe contacted me and asked if I would consider trying out their new Dead Sea Mud Mask.VoilaVe use 100% pure, natural and certified organic ingredients that are free of sulfates, phosphates and parabens.&lt;br /&gt;  For centuries mud from the Dead Sea has been known as a natural beauty remedy. The mud contains more than twenty-one skin-reviving materials that include minerals such as magnesium, calcium, sulfur, bromide, iodine, sodium, zinc and potassium. Although we get these minerals regularly in our bodies we are constantly losing them and as we age we lose minerals at an even faster pace. These minerals are important for skin care because they are known to treat, detoxify and cleanse the skin keeping it looking young and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;  The benefits of this mask are a plethora of things including tightening pores, promoting young natural skin. The Dead Sea Mud can heal, soften and revitalize your skin for an all day glow. The organic essential oils in the mask work to moisturize and hydrate the skin reducing wrinkles. It also comes in a huge 16 oz tub and with a free eguide to &amp;#34;8 Secrets To Younger Looking Skin&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;  Although I do not consider myself having a wrinkle problem at my age, I do believe you are never too young to moisturize and take care of your skin. It is the largest organ of your body. This mask felt fabulous on my face. It went on very easily and a little goes a long way. It did not take long to dry at all. I have used it several times now and it does really improve the texture of my skin and helps to clear my complexion which is always appreciated. I love the feel and smell of the mud and it comes off very easy and is very non irritating. I highly recommend this product. It should be a must have in your beauty regimen.&lt;br /&gt;  Next Generation Stay At Home Mom gives VoilaVe&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Mask&lt;br /&gt; 5 Stars!comes off very easy and is very non irritating. I highly recommend this product. It should be a must have in your beauty regimen.&lt;br /&gt;  Next Generation Stay At Home Mom gives VoilaVe&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Mask&lt;br /&gt; 5 Stars!</li>
    <li> Awesome product! My face looked fantastic after using this mask just one time!!  I have dry skin and this mask doesn&#x27;t dry it out further. I use the mask at least once a week. Its also very easy to take off, which is nice because no one likes having to scrub vigorously at stubborn face masks to remove them.  The amount in the container is huge!  I&#x27;ve had the same jar for months.  I highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> feels nice- goes on smooth</li>
    <li> I have naturally oily skin and I have a slight for of eczema on my cheeks and after using the mud mask just twice a month my face is clear and I always get asked how do you have such perfect skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also tried some on my friends psoriasis on his knuckles and just one time lightened it and made it less noticeable. This mud is phenomenal!</li>
    <li> It goes on real creamy so thought it would not work my oily skin. Dries tight and tightens pores. My kin felt very smooth afterwards. A bit pricey so will see how long it last.</li>
    <li> Great products, will order again.</li>
    <li> My skin feels so smooth and soft! We had a girls night facial party last night with 5 ladies and used this dead sea mask. Everybody enjoyed this product a lot and asking where ingot it from!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can feel the toxins being drawn out. Cleans my pores and oils. Baby soft skin afterwards and not dry! This tub is a good size and going to go a long way.  Feels gelatinous and easy to spread.  Ready to use straight out of the tub, no mixing with water. Easy to wash and not messy! Love that this is 100% natural with no additives. My face appears to have a glow. I didn&#x27;t even use a moisturizer and skin still feels smooth and oil free! Happy to have tried this product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, I&#x27;m very pleased, outstanding results. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> looks amazing.&lt;br /&gt;i can NOT wait to try this</li>
    <li> Amazing product. i can&#x27;t wait until I can use it tonight. Time to pamper myself with a in home spa day.</li>
    <li> The Dead Sea Mud was cool and refreshing . It mad my face and neck feel soft . Now I want to know if you can use it for any thing els . It would be nice if it had more information what you can use it for. On the other hand it made my face feel great.</li>
    <li> This product left my skin feeling very good and looking very good. My complexion was very nice afterwards. It didn&#x27;t really smell like anything.</li>
    <li> LOVE this mask .it is so good for your face,and it doesn&#x27;t dry it up like most masks do. and it also does not have a smell like most facial products do !!</li>
    <li> Its a great product,leaves your skin very silke smooth, its soft, organic and real</li>
    <li> Great stuff.My face never felt better</li>
    <li> I really never knew how well Dead Sea ingredients worked until I started doing reviews. I always saw them at the mall, but never tried them.  I have to say that they are absolutely amazing, they really do have healing capabilities for your skin and body :)  So this mud mask is no different, it comes in a large 16 oz jar and is all organic.  Plus it&#x27;s ready to go, all you do is swipe some out of the jar and spread it on your face!  And that feels so good, it&#x27;s a nice cool feeling to have on your face!  This mud mask is imported directly from Israel so you know you are getting THE best dead sea minerals and more benefits than you will probably ever know.  100% natural with no chemicals or artificial additives, once washed off your face feels clean, fresh and renewed!  I noticed a change in my acne problem, it definitely helped reduce it, and I have heard that people who suffer from rosacea will notice a difference too.  Dead Sea minerals are so easy on your skin, they don&#x27;t have the harsh chemicals like regular soap does, and instead of drying out your skin they will leave it soft and silky.  Highly recommend giving this mask a try, easy to use and awesome results - it is well worth it!</li>
    <li> I have tried many dead sea mud masks in my time. And my one complaint with all others has been their smell. I understand that the dead sea mud masks might not smell the best, however this one was the least offensive that I have ever yet to try. Any others in the past that I tried were just too much for me to even use. This one I can work with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this about 2 to 3 times a week at night. I tend to put it on after my shower when my face is clean, then leave it for 15 to 20 minutes. It will dry, and that is when you know it&#x27;s time to wash it off. I myself suffer from dry, sensitive skin. This leaves my skin feeling soft, hydrated, firm, and just healthy looking. Immediately after washing this mask off, I apply my favorite moisturizer, and then I am ready for bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am quite happy with this mask. The container is a great size, and there is enough product in it to last you for a while. I also like that this company takes the time to write the month and year the contents expire by date. Many other companies are very vague with the expiration of their masks. Plus the containers come with a seal inside, which again is something I haven&#x27;t experienced with other companies and the masks they offer. Outstanding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best face mask I have ever used. My skin looks and feels radiant after each use. To top it off, the owner of VoilaVe exhibited the absolute highest level of professionalism and customer service in checking in with me, giving me product information and just making sure he supported my needs. Point blank, I love this product and encourage anyone who wants to significantly beautify their face to try it.</li>
    <li> The mask is very smooth.  However, the instructions say apply a thin layer, but when I apply a thin layer, I feel like I don&#x27;t have enough on my face.  The first time I used it, I applied it while in the shower, figuring I would wash other parts of my body while I waited for the mask to dry.  Mistake!  The steam from the water didn&#x27;t allow the mask to drive properly so I observed no results.  The next day, I let the mask dry on my face before getting in the shower and my skin was noticeably softer.  Long story short, the jury is still out for me on this one, but so far it seems okay.</li>
    <li> Thick, muddy and so nice. My skin felt so clean and a little tighter. I used it on my son&#x27;s acne prone skin and it got dramatically better after 3 uses. Wasn&#x27;t smelly at all. In fact I&#x27;d say its odor free. I love it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Works great, and my skin is so soft. Ive never been too girly in skin care, but this stuff is easy on, easy off. While it dries I can continue with my house hold work.</li>
    <li> This product lives up to its promises and more.  My first usage of this product had my skin feeling so clean without causing any irritation to my skin.  It has been several days and my skin still feel soft and clean.  You should definitely give this product a try you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product. Highly recommend it. It has helped tremendously with my acne and scars.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing mask for anyone struggling with large pores,  I use this mask every other morning and it has not dried out my skin at all. My pores have shrunk and my skin feels cleaner. I use the other facial products from this line: Hyaluronic Acid, Rosehip Oil, the Vitamin C Serum, and the Argon Oil and Eye Gel. I believe they are all working together to get the fabulous results I&#x27;m getting.  I don&#x27;t use them all every night and morning except for the Eye Gel. I alternate the use of the other serums. I have Sjogren&#x27;s Disease which can cause discoloration of the skin around the neck similar to melasma. I have been using the products (except the mask) down on my neck and chest area and have noticed the slight lightening of the dark patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the products and using as many of them as you can afford together to get the best results.</li>
    <li> I love this facial mask! It makes my face look clean &amp; reguvinated.</li>
    <li> This is a very easy product to use. Silky feeling on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Note if you having extractions of white or blackheads use product before extractions. Helps soften skin. If you do extractions first mud can cause a burning in the extraction area.</li>
    <li> Excellent! I use it after treatments to soothe my skin and a great value.</li>
    <li> I really like this facial mask.  I let my daughters use it too.  After using it, our skins feel smooth, clean and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Haven&#x27;t used it much yet, but it moisturizes and feels great afterwards. Very fast shipping</li>
    <li> I bought this at a amazing discount price from Snagshout because my boyfriend was having issues with little acne bumps and it would make him uncomfortable so I decided to have him try this product. The first use it was already clearing up his face so now with regular use his face is completely clear. This stuff is amazing! Will buy over and over again!</li>
    <li> I have heard so many wonderful things about facials from Dead Sea mud but know that I could never afford to go to a spa to have one. So when VoilàVe sent me their Dead Sea Mud Mask I was super excited to try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask is organic and all natural, which is one of the reasons I really like it, and is made with mud imported from the Dead Sea in Israel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mud mask provides a gentle facial exfoliation and deep cleansing. The mask has a slightly earthy smell when you open the jar, but there is no scent or odor when you put it on your face. It dries quickly and easy to remove. My skin felt fresh and hydrated and I try to use this once every 7-10 days</li>
    <li> This is the best mask I have every used.  It wipes away all my dead skin and I swear my pores are cleaned out.  I have awful little tiny blackheads.  I love using this because it makes them seem much less noticeable.  i would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this only for about one week but so far, I&#x27;m loving it.  There aren&#x27;t any harsh chemicals here! No abrasives at all. The instructions say to use once a week but its such a smooth blend, that I find I&#x27;m using it as part of my nightly routine to exfoliate after I&#x27;ve taken my makeup off and cleansed my face.  I don&#x27;t leave it on until it dries, like the instruction says, but when I wash it off, my skin feels silky smooth and very refreshed!</li>
    <li> The ingredients look fantastic but for some reason the mask stings and burns after just a few mins of being on. I thought maybe I was juts sensitive to something in it but the same thing happened to my sister and we have very different skin types. I&#x27;m very unhappy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff! It makes my face feel so soft and clean!</li>
    <li> I  absolutely love this product.. It has cleared up my skin and made it soft.</li>
    <li> Seems to work good,time will tell but it does seem to reduce my oily skin,close pores and improve my overall skin condition</li>
    <li> I am in love with this facial mask! I have combination skin and hormonal acne breakouts. This is the only product that helps keep my skin clear and literally stops a breakout just as it is getting started. A little goes a long way. It washes off completely and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight/dry afterwards. I highly recommend trying this.</li>
    <li> Amazing mud mask. It makes my face smooth, clean is not as drying as usual clay masks. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> A wonderful Dead Sea mask that you can not live without! I feel like I have a new face! How refreshing my face feels and rejuvenating too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mud from Dead Sea is idyllic for people who suffer from extreme dryness and skin irritation. Adverse skin conditions like psoriasis can be cured with the help of Dead Sea minerals. The effective composition will balance moisture, strengthen the protection system, improve the skin condition and regenerate cells at a faster rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying this facial mask. I use the mask once or twice a week and it is helping my skin. It helps to pull out clogs in my skin, also my skin feels so soft after I rinse the mask off. I love that it is a large size, a little goes a long way with this product. No need to pack it on your face, this jar will last me for a while.</li>
    <li> This works really well. It is a little drying so you will want to apply a good moisturizer afterwards but I am really pleased. And the jar is huge for the price. This will last me at least a year. I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This tub is huge! Since I have used this my face is smoother and glows due to the mask drawing out the nasty old oil and impurities. As it was drying it felt tight and it felt good. I was left with a nice clean feeling on my face each time! I had no problems with it leaving residue in my pores. You can see the natural clean glow on my face since ive used this!</li>
    <li> Great thick consistency and left my skin feeling feeling supple and moist.</li>
    <li> Works great goes on smooth</li>
    <li> I am honestly loving this mask! First of all -- it smells like -- NOTHING -- which is awesome compared to some &amp;#34;beauty masks&amp;#34; that I have used in the past. It is a really generously sized jar too and the ingredients are wonderful.  I have very dry skin on my face as well as some areas on my shoulders that tend to break out in the summer -- the mask was awesome for both issues!  Goes on easy and REALLY feels like it is pulling stuff out when it drys -- and my skin afterwards was very soft, supple and nourished.</li>
    <li> My skin feels so very soft after using this mask! I had problems with blackheads and a oily nose and a dry forehead!!! Crazy, right?! So after talking to a friend who has been using this product, I gave it whirl. I used some of hers and it was great!! My skin glowed! So I ordered some right away...I&#x27;ve been using it weekly but I think I can get away with less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad she introduced me to it! I get great compliments!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you find my review helpful! Click on the helpful button is you like my review.  I think it&#x27;s important to let others now what we, consumers think of a product!</li>
    <li> Omgosh i love this mask. I thought it would have been thicker then it is but i actually ended up loking how it was thicker in the end. My skin had never looked better. It feels tighter smoother and looks nicer. This is definitely going to be a staple in my beauty regimen for now on.my skin has never looked ao good after i used it. Im in love</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t the best mud mask I&#x27;ve ever used and its not the worst either. It smelled a lot better than most that I have tried though. I liked that it is made for more than your face unlike others. I used it on my arms as well as my face and it worked really good to get the dry skin off the back of my arms and it did make my face feel cleaner and tighter. I did find that it made my face feel kind of dry so I had to apply a moisturizer to rehydrate (especially my t-zone). If it wasn&#x27;t for the drying out of my face I would have given it 5 stars</li>
    <li> Absolutely the BEST! It has been 102 degrees here this summer, and my skin was breaking out from the heat and perspiration. I decided to try this Dead Sea Mud Mask one evening. It was so quick and simple. Afterwards my skin was radiant, the pores were amazingly reduced in size, the wrinkles were smoother, and my face felt clean and fabulous. It has been a long time since I have felt so good about a product. It is still summer and very hot and humid, but my skin looks great!! I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments.

    <li> I have been extremely happy with this company and their product line. It&#x27;s the best price and the best products I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> love this facial mask-- makes my skin feel great.  I have sensitive skin and have no problems with this.  The tub is huge and will last a long time.</li>
    <li> My son and I both just tried the Dead Sea Mask for the first time.  Our skin was smoother, tone more even and my son even told me it looked like I had fewer wrinkles!  I can&#x27;t wait to see what continued usage will do for me!!!</li>
    <li> really a nah product. trust  me don&#x27;t waste you money</li>
    <li> Love this mask.  Clears up dry skin on my face.</li>
    <li> wow, I was actually pretty skeptical but my skin, well, my face looks great.  Im 32, I look 23.  seriously for guys out there, shave, face wash, and pat dry and try this mask you will be stokes, for sure.  try it, its not that much but I would definitely only do this every two weeks; I needed face lotion after you wash off and dry.  BUT, next day, your face will be new, you&#x27;ll look like a new man.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this two times a week for a month and it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for me, yet.</li>
    <li> Dead Sea mud works miracles for a wide range of skin types. It is idyllic for people who suffer from extreme dryness and skin irritation. During winter my skin is dry and always peeling, yet has really oily patches, along with redness and spots. When I received a Dead Sea Mud Mask I decided to have at-home spa day. The Dead Sea Mud Mask a thick dark color paste, and I put it all over my t-zone. It was easy to apply. I was afraid that this mud mask may have unpleasant scent; however, I found it doesn&#x27;t have any scent at all which is so great. I left this mud for 20 minutes and then I rinse it off. I instantly noticed the glow my skin had. It really looked healthy and gorgeous. The next day my skin felt extremely smooth even hours after my lotion application. This was easy to use and gave my instant results. I will be using once a week. This is my favorite way to renew and revive my skin. Excellent product! I received this as a gift to share my experiences while using this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this product! It feels like it has a cooling component when you put it on. It&#x27;s actually quite refreshing. It starts to harden after about three minutes. I think this will be a new semiweekly routine for me!</li>
    <li> This is a huge container!  I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it!  The mask if very easy to apply to your face, not thick like some masks.  It is a light black color when first applied and then turns to a like grey when it is dried.  If you apply a thin layer it takes about 10-15 minutes to dry. There are a lot of oils in this mask so I will keep using it and see if my skin feels better.  It has a lot of organic ingredients in it also.  Don&#x27;t need a lot so it will last a long time.  I love the way my face feels after I have used it!</li>
