      <li>I love the ointment too</li>
      <li>I used the ointment for the most itchy areas.</li>

    <li> soap is ok, cream is a bit stinky but it helps control my exczema</li>
    <li> Day 1: I applied as directed, then went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;Day 2: By the end of the day, bursted out in acne (terrible yes, but those blemishes were bound to come out some time, they were already there) but at the end of the day thoroughly cleansed my skin and removed any bacteria, applied slufur cream then went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;Day 3: Skin much better, acne from day before drying out quickly, skin not as red. Followed directions as instructed.&lt;br /&gt;Day 4: Great! Skin clearing up quickly, skin not as oily. No bumps either, which is a mayor relief. I will keep on using, and clean up my diet ( no sugars or dairy/ white carbs ) and see how this goes. I am optimistic to rid myself from adult acne!</li>
    <li> I like the soap and cream.</li>
    <li> The soap is great for my skin and working like promised. I haven&#x27;t used the butter so not able to rate that....</li>
    <li> I tried this product when it first came out in the sulphur butter sal3 package.  I&#x27;ve been using sal3 for years, and I must say the butter is an excellent addition to my skin care army.  I love using it to target areas on my skin, like say I have a blood blister or a small breakout.  It works great!  Also, a bit off topic but still pretty neat, it makes me look super bronzed when I use it on my torso when I&#x27;m at the lake.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff ! I was expecting the products to have a very strong sulfur smell but they don&#x27;t ! The sulfur butter goes on smooth and a little goes a long way ! The soap was not as drying as I thought it would be ! I bought this to help combact scabies along with my prescription medication! After using I felt no crawling feeling! I also started using it on my daughter&#x27;s scalp where she was bald and now she has a little fuzz sprouting there !  Will reorder</li>
    <li> As described. Not bad at all.</li>
    <li> It smells so bad, and didnt sooth fdry skin as expected.</li>
    <li> i LOVE this soap.  Helps with dandruff, acne, jock itch, athlete&#x27;s foot and sanitizing/cleaning a cut/wound.  Two thumbs up, I still use it everyday.</li>
    <li> this really works for unknown itchy skin conditions.</li>
    <li> I have been using this combination of soap and sulfur butter for about six months for rosacea. My rosacea was resistant to medication that is usually used to keep it under control because skin mites got out of control due to my compromised immune system. In addition to the antibiotics I was using to treat my skin my dermatologist suggested I use sulfur soap at 3% but 10% was the only one I could find. During exacerbations of the rosacea I would wash my face twice a day with this and also with an antibacterial soap once a day. Now that my skin is under control which is definitely due in part to these products I only use the soap once a day because it can be very drying especially when left onto long. I still use the sulfur butter two times each day morning and night. I also use the sulfur butter on acne or any other spot I happened to find and it&#x27;s usually gone within a day. I think this is pretty amazing stuff! And since it does dry the skin to a certain extent, I have found that with extended use my skin slightly peels off slowly and it acts as a slow exfoliator. I had a lot of scarring last year due to the treatments I was getting for my rosacea and I&#x27;m amazed at how clear my skin looks now, of course please keep in mind I was also using antibiotics so that probably also contributed to my skin&#x27;s recovery.</li>
    <li> There is a slight hint of sulfur but its not offensive. I use the soap when I shower before bed, and you feel very refreshed afterwards. The creme is thick and effective - I use it for dry, cracked feet or elbows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are all natural, and the company is located in a part of Texas that has many naturally occurring mineral elements.&lt;br /&gt;Sulfur infused soaps and cremes can treat common skin conditions, in addition to having antibacterial and antiseptic benefits. I&#x27;ll be ordering more again soon.</li>
    <li> Great product works well would recommend this to anyone with skin conditons</li>
    <li> I took this for my family cause they had some pimples one the body and itch οn their body so with this package all the pimples gone...! VEERY GOOD PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I wouldnt wish scabies upon my worst enemy, not from being dirty, easily contracted if a family member gets it,, the rx cream is essential to kill the mites, but u need these to calm the itch and bumps u get from the permethrin cream , also the sulfar will kill any newly hatched mites the rx cream may not get,peace of mind theses products work  in conjunction with the poisoning mite cream ,, theres hope if u use this daily within a month scsbies was defeated</li>
    <li> This is the only product which successfully treated my severe scalp eczema.  After trying numerous shampoos, conditioners, and dermatologist prescribed treatments this is the only one what actually worked.  It relieved the horrible chronic itch and soothed my rough dry scalp.  What makes it even better is it is smooth lightweight and inexpensive.  So glad I found this product because it finally ended my suffering and no longer scratching my scalp like a crazy person. Some others complain about the smell but I don&#x27;t find it unpleasant because I only use a small amount.  Will order this again and again.</li>
    <li> This stuff works!  I was skeptical at first but also willing to try it. I&#x27;ve been breaking out a lot lately and I scar easily. I hated looking at the marks. I&#x27;ve been using this product 2x a day and nearly all of my dark spots have faded into near invisibility. And it works quickly too. I am so glad I bought this product and would definitely recommend this to anyone who suffers from the same problem I do.</li>
    <li> works right away..first time..</li>
    <li> I am extremely disappointed with my purchase it just smells like I ordered a small jar of coco butter there is no trace of ANY sulfur which this jar supposedly has 10% of... we all know sulfur has a strong scent . If I wanted coco butter I would have ordered some.&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware. And the Sal 3 soap smells just like perfume I won&#x27;t be putting that on my face for anything.&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware your not getting what u pay for</li>
    <li> Speedy service and great product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 30 and still suffer from the occasional outbreak of pimples on my face. I saw on tv that adults should use a sulfer product for acne outbreaks.  After trying EVERY kind of acne medication and washes I decided to try this one. Its amazing! After just a couple of uses my face has totally cleared! The few pimples that I had on my face that were having a hardtime healing are now almost ccompletely gone and I don&#x27;t see any others coming out.This stuff is amazing. I wash my face with the soap twice a day (morning and night) and I use the sulfer butter at night and sleep with is on. Get this stuff, you won&#x27;t regret it!!!!</li>
    <li> Have not used enough to put it in the five star.  But it seems to do the trick.</li>
    <li> I use the soap first then the butter and then use black soap to finish my face.  Love it and it works well.</li>
    <li> This product burns like hell does not work for me. If you want to fell like your being attacked by fire ants this will do it.I will definitely be returning it soon.</li>
    <li> Seemed to help my scabies, but it was not a cure. Would recommend buying at this price</li>
    <li> My review: our yard has been inhabited by mites since day one of living here. In summer, mites make a concerted effort to live inside the house.  My neighbors keep chickens, a natural host, and that may be the cause of the sheer number of them and the static population.  Some say bird mites don&#x27;t infest people, yet others say they certainly do. All I care about is to work in my yard without mites trying to burrow into my skin.  This set works pretty well for my situation.  I apply this sulfur ointment before going outside.  After yard work I use the soap to wash off any hitch hiking bugs.  I&#x27;m happy with the soap and ointment and wouldn&#x27;t survive summer in Texas without them.  My husband used this combo every evening for a month for a rash.  Cortisone got rid of the rash but it came back, so he used this faithfully and was getting positive results.  However, he ultimately thought that the ointment was too smelly to wear to work, so his results may have been slow as a result of his limited use.  Updated:  this reduced the rash more than half.  The remedy became too drying during winter and caused itching.  At this point, he switched to de****e soap and moisturized afterwards with my gluten-free lotion (though he doesn&#x27;t have celiac and has no allergies to grains)  The rash is finally gone.  Hope this helps those who need a multi-prong approach when the sulfur combination isn&#x27;t enough.</li>
    <li> I got this and I can tell you for me it worked for the buggers .. and I loved that the sulfur butter still treated but at the same time medicated. I bought another kit just to have to use once in awhile or just in case!</li>
    <li> I purchase this for my mother for her itching relief from scabies.  The ointment seemed to provide the best relief from the horrible itching that she was experiencing and when i say that we tried everything, i mean we tried everything.  We have also used this to relieve itching due to chiggers.  It seems to calm the skin.</li>
    <li> Finally a treatment for itchy, hot skin and painful inflammation. The ointment is creamy and not heavy. The soap has cleared my blackhead prone skin and made breakouts less painful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used scrubs, cleansers, toners etc for years with no real results. I heard about Sulfur soap to clear up acne from someone years ago, but never actually tried it. Couple of weeks ago I had a terrible acne flare up, which was very painful and embarrassing and I thought about purchasing a sulfur soap and I found this combo. I always had some issues with my skin, but it was never this bad. I started using this sulfur soap (the smell is very pleasant) and the ointment for bed time (smells pleasant, little greasy but fine overall). The next day, I started to see some difference and improvement in my outbreak. My acne almost disappeared in two weeks of using this product, while I was also supplementing my diet with Zinc, and Biotin supplement (Fabulous Hair, Skin and Nails) and vitamin C. My skin was never this healthy looking, blemish and acne free. Now, I use this soap once a day, still take supplements. When I see something on my skin that I don&#x27;t like (something that seems like it can turn into a pimple) I rub some ointment onto it and by next day the problem is gone!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for this wonderful product!</li>
    <li> in conjuction with vasaline, worked like a charm.</li>
    <li> My husband gets a rash on his scalp (bald) and this helps to keep it under control.  Works as promised.</li>
    <li> Good set to use for various skin ailments. I bought to help soothe insect bites that caused very itchy, irritated skin. Sulfur butter especially soothed insect bites. Only caveat, is the scent from soap, don&#x27;t think other people notice but I can at times after using it. Although I recommend it since nothing else worked like this!</li>
    <li> The soap is fine, but I do not care for the ointment. It leaves my skin very greasy and with it being summer it&#x27;s an awful combo. If u can just use at night and wash off in am that works best. It is def very moisturizing and seems to help....just not good to put on during the day, especially when it&#x27;s hot out.</li>
    <li> This product was late by 3-4 days.  My skin didn&#x27;t like it. Good product (combination of ingredients may work great ON FEET (athlete&#x27;s, fungus type of issues) ...my skin (hands-eczema) is VERY sensitive to mostly EVERYTHING!</li>
    <li> Instantly cleared my problem areas that I suffered with for years</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my skin feel so soft.  I had a rash come up on my body and I never have figured out what it was but after bathing with this sulphur bar it went away and my skin feels really soft.</li>
    <li> I loved how quickly and effectively this product took care of our dreadful mite infestation. I was very worried about using potentially harmful medication and this worked like a charm. I ordered more to keep around just in case.</li>
    <li> i used this product for my dermatitis skiing problems i just love it, gray job guys keep it that way</li>
    <li> I have cystic acne. It definitely helped but didn&#x27;t resolve the problem. Worked mainly for smaller bumps. My main problem is, while you won&#x27;t smell like the sulfer, your towel will and I have to wash it separately from my clothes. Otherwise all the clothing will smell. But the hassle is worth the results. Also didn&#x27;t dry me out because I used the butter that came with the soap.</li>
    <li> all my life i have had bumps all over my arms.as i matured my skin only seemed to get worse. i have tried everything besides a prescription because i dont have insurance. having people look at your weird scabby arms and knowing that theyre wondering what is wrong with you is depressing. i have always been super self conscious of my unruly skin and it made me sad. people used to ask me what was wrong with my arms. this is the first product that has ever helped me. i have been using the soap and cream for the last few days every day and my skin is already evening out in color and almost all the open wounds are healed already. thank goodness for this product. i can walk around feeling comfortable in my own skin for the first time in  my life. thats huge.. finally i have a solution. this has changed my life so much. thank you. thank you.</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong with this Butter, its not like a grease like patroium jelly. My skin loves it and it seems like it gets absorbed, not leaving you sticky.</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s excellent. Loving the lotion :) I believe it&#x27;s clearing up some of the &amp;#34;sebum&amp;#34; bumps I&#x27;ve had issues with on the bottom of my cheek area.</li>
    <li> I received my products yesterday and can already see a 50% improvement in my skin today, which makes Braunfels sulfer soap and ointment winners in my book.  I was concerned about the ointment, but it is VERY skin friendly, does not clog pores and leaves my skin super soft and smooth, with ZERO irritation (I have extremely sensitive skin).  These products were made to be used together and they work in perfect harmony, with wonderful results.  I will be back for more.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now, the rash is almost completely gone, the feel of my skin is great, very conditioned, I tried almost everything, even Dr. recommended, but nothing worked but this, in combination with the soap.  I will be a faithful user from now on, I highly recommend if you have a skin rash that you just don&#x27;t know for sure what it is, I suspect mine was scabies, but I never got an official diagnosis.  This stuff works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had some sort of rash on and around my pinky finger for almost a year, my Dr. could not identify it, cortisone did not work, anti bacterial did not work, anti fungal did not work, I got the sal2 soap a few months ago, and it helped but I continued to have the breakouts, I did some research online, and came to the conclusion it was scabies, I could not afford a Dermatologist, so I ordered this combo, and after 3 days, the rash is disappearing, and no break outs.  I soap in the hottest water I can stand, then put the cream on afterwards, and do this several times a day.  The skin was always usually red and then scaly, itching at times but not badly, the area is healing, less red, I love this stuff, great skin softener also.  Highly recommend to try for your symptoms.</li>
    <li> The soap is amazing.  I have a skin allergy which itches and when I use the&lt;br /&gt;soap it soothes, comforts and lathers really well.  When I use the soap  I&lt;br /&gt;partner it with peroxide when wetting the cloth to wash.  I did not get any&lt;br /&gt;benefits from the sulfur cream.  After using the cream my skin still itched.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase more of the soap in the near future.</li>
    <li> I had two persistent patches of very dry, flaky, red skin on my forehead and between my nose and eye. A friend told me to try a sulfur-based product so I did some research and found this. Within about 5 days, both patches were completely gone and my skin is back to normal! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have off &amp; on painful (possibly cystic) Acne. And since I have received this pair of ointment &amp; soap ,thus far I tried the soap &amp; it seemed to STOP my current break out from continuing to break out all over my face like it always does... And the larger deeper pimples are healing(or drying out) I was hesitant to use the ointment as well as the cream together just worried it may be too strong for my first usage,so eventually If I am not too sensitive to the soap I will start using the ointment as well. And I will give an update about the affects on my acne on both products after a longer usage period. But so far I feel pleased!! And I wish I had know about this years ago!! BTW I was surprised it doesn&#x27;t have a awful sulfur smell, They both have a nice faint soap smell that wasn&#x27;t a over powering sulfur smell... Oh and One thing is its called Ointment, so I was expecting a thick clear-ish type of ointment, But this more like a cream. Sulfur Cream due to the white color and consistancy of thicker body lotion. The package arrived rather quick considering it was sent to me in Alaska...</li>
    <li> The ointment seems to help my daughters eczema a little and my scalp overnight with the itching. will keep you updated.</li>
    <li> I love this soap it is not too strong to say it contains sulfur but yet effective. I love the ointment too it absorbs quickly and not overly greasy. good purchase and will buy again....</li>
    <li> Work fine. I guess with longer use I shall see better result.</li>
    <li> This soap is just the best for keeping my skin clear. I like the ointment as well. I don&#x27;t need to use the ointment daily so this will last for quite some time.</li>
    <li> Put it on my bug bites and it made them stop itching but they still did not go away right away. But that did help.</li>
    <li> The ointment worked very well for a dry and flaking scalp.  The soap is good also but perhaps not as effective as the ointment.</li>
    <li> I HAD IT ALL; ALL THE THINGS PEOPLE WERE GROANING ABOUT AND WRITING ABOUT, IT SEEMED I HAD THEM ALL. I HAD HAD ITCHING UNDER THE SIN IN MY RIGHT  ARM FOR A YEAR. DRY HEELS. DRU BACK. DANDRUFF, ETC ETC. I FELT LIKE A PIECE FOR THE GARBAGE DISPOSAL AND, LIKE MANY,  I HAD BEEN TO THE DERMATOLOGIST...UNSUCCESSFULLY.  NOW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  ITCHING UNDER SKIN...GONE AND I HAVE TONS OF SULFER MED LEFT&lt;br /&gt;2.  DRY SKIN PLAUGHING MY ARMS:  GONE&lt;br /&gt;3.  DRY, CRACKED HEELS WHICH SEEM TO PLAGUE MANY;  GONE, BUT  I CONTINUE TO USE THE SOAP.  I WANT NO RECURRENCE!&lt;br /&gt;4.  BRUISED SARMS THAT LOOKED LIKE MYN GRANDMOTHER&#x27;S: GONE&lt;br /&gt;5.  DANDRUFF: GOING...BE SURE TO RINSE CAREFULLY. I FOUND I WAS USING TOO MUCH CONDITIONER.&lt;br /&gt;6.  DRY SKIN EVERYWHERE EVERYWHERE (I JUST CANNOT SAY THIS ONE ENOUGH):  GONE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. THE SOAP DOES NOT LATHER HAIR AS EASILY AS REPORTED ON MY HAIR, BUT I HAVE THICK THICK HAIR AND FOUND I WAS USING TOO MUCH CONDITIONER (IT MAKES ITS OWN LITTLE FLAKES)&lt;br /&gt;2.I DO HAVE TO USE MORE LOTION ON MY THIN HAND SKIN...CAUSE I USE SO MUCH OF THE SOAP ON MY THICK HAIR&lt;br /&gt;3.  I HAVE TO USE MORE DEODARANT AS THIS IS NOT A DEODARANT SOAP&lt;br /&gt;4.  SULFER DOES NOT SMELL ALL THAT GREAT, SO WEAR AT NIGHT AND WASH OFF IN AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JUST GETTING RID OF THE DRYNAWFUL SKIN AND CRACKS ON MY FEET (I AM A DESERT DWELLER, BUT DONNOT LIVE WITH A SHIEK, SO DO MY OWN FEET) IS A MIRACLE WITHIN ITSSELF! I SEE MS LIKE I SEE A TON OF PRODUCTS FOR UGLY CRACKED FEET, AND HERE THE REAL ANSWER IS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I SAW A LITTLE AD, SO THOUGHTFUL OF AMAZON TO TIP ME TO IT....SULFER SOAP WITH LAVENDER...I MAY TRY THAT, BUT FOR NOW, I AM WITH THIS AN SO GRATEFUL! GET SOME OR GET SOME FOR YOUR POOR FRIEND WHO IS LOOKING FOR RELIEF!</li>
    <li> I cannot rave enough about these products.  After using the soap &amp; sulfur butter for 3 weeks my skin is completely clear, acne &amp; scar free. I have recommended these products to family &amp; friends. I simply love it.</li>
    <li> Good product for treating scabies, which I picked up from traveling, as a home remedy. I was skeptical that sulfur soap would do much for scabies, expecting the only treatment to be something expensive prescribed by a doctor. Reading some of the literature on sulfur soap, I saw that many doctors in the &#x27;40s and &#x27;50s treated people diagnosed with scabies with 15% sulfur soap. Generally, lathering up (perhaps scrubbing the skin first) with sulfur soap and leaving on to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; for 10-15 minutes led to the disappearance of scabies after 3-7 days of treatment. The skin may still be itchy for 1-2 weeks due to residual allergic reactions, but would go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it took me 3-4 weeks of using this 10% sulfur product for the scabies to clear up, but it did. Would recommend anyone suffering from scabies to try this product.</li>
    <li> I think it is effective for certain skin maladies - but not for eczema. The soap is quite harsh and extremely dries the skin. That would be a problem if you have eczema. I cannot remark about the sulfur cream though, I did not use it at all.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use the sulfur butter very much as I am past the excessive acne stage. But when I do get a little bugger, this seems to help. However, I bought the soap to relieve my dandruff. It smells great, but alas, there is still a lingering sulfur smell (after all, sulfur is the helpful ingredient). I used to use dandruff shampoo but the dandruff always came back fast after I stopped using it. With this soap, I only have to use it occasionally when I have a dandruff flair up. I&#x27;ll use the sulfur butter when I get bad patches of itchy dandruff. So far, (and it&#x27;s been over a year), I am extremely happy with these products and when it&#x27;s all used up, I will purchase again and again.</li>
    <li> Really like the addition of the ointment for skin.  I have eczema and this combo is excellent to keep it under control and without infection.</li>
    <li> I began suffering from the dreaded Cystic Acne, which becomes very common when our PH balance, hormones and physical intolerance&#x27;s occur (think sugar, alcohol, etc).&lt;br /&gt;I have used pretty much everything. My dermatologist prescribed me Spironolactone, which works quite well, but do not feel comfortable with the list of side effects and you are not supposed to drink. At all. Then I was prescribed Vaniqa (a topical for unwanted facial hair), which ironically works better than the Spironolactone.&lt;br /&gt;It is terribly expensive though!&lt;br /&gt;That is when I began researching other alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;I came across the usual list of foods to avoid, blah, blah, blah...I am not an extremist and really hate cutting things out I love to do in moderation. Then I came across this sulfur ointment with bar soap.&lt;br /&gt;I read up on how well it works and bought it. I use this ointment in tandem with the Vaniqa and the results are AMAZING!!&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any Cystic Acne in three weeks!! (Cystic Acne is hard welts that seem like regular acne, but when lanced with a diabetic needle are fluid filled pockets that scar your face terribly and are incredibly painful). What I find the MOST effective about this sulfur ointment is that it has literally removed all the Cystic Acne scarring and dark shading residual I was struggling with on my chin-line and neck.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter is now using the Sulfur bar soap with her clarisonic and all the teenage bumpy s they tend to struggle with is all but gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be repurchasing this product when I need to and it has actively reversed ALOT of what I have struggled with over the past three years, without medical side effects.</li>
    <li> after just a week all my blackhead are starting to go away i feel so much better about my self now thank you for selling this</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s working, clearing up my face and back. Adult womens acne is hard to deal with but It looks better.</li>
    <li> This definitely helped relieve itching.</li>
    <li> Looks like someone has already been used many times. Just threw it in the garbage</li>
    <li> The soap adds a bit too the cleaning of sores, bites and scraps.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product on several things. Living in the country, kids get into a lot and they get bites and scrapes. After cleaning the area, I just apply to the area. Sulfur is good for your skin. Clears up the areas, quite nicely. I also use this on my dogs boo boo&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This soap lasted a very long time. I wash my face 2 or 3x per day. To day it helped my acne....emm not exactly but it&#x27;s got lasting power. Never really used the moisturizer.  It was really gritty.</li>
    <li> It was comforting to the bug bites I had and seem to discourage more. The consistency of it was not mixed well but all in all it was a good product.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quick and was as represented.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing it claimed to. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone. I was so hopeful with all the great reviews this product would be the difference I have been looking for. Unfortunately, I feel ripped off again.</li>
    <li> The salve in this product helped heal some bug bites on my arms and legs.  This salve doesn&#x27;t smell so good but, it will get the job done.</li>
    <li> This product is great for acne, just be careful  not to dry out your skin. Try to balance with a light moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I use it to help with the itchiness of bed bug bites, it works well and i actually find the odor of the soap to be pleasing.</li>
    <li> After years of skin issues, dermatologists&#x27; lotions and potions, I finally found the magic elixir.  I had an outbreak of what might have been scabies.  These two products eased the pain and itching....but did not cure the exotic disease I picked up, undiagnosed by 3 physicians. It was permethrin that took it away.  Buuuut, my face and abdomen have cleared, my skin is soft, the wrinkles are not so deep, the soap lathers, the cream is WONDERFUL!  I will not be without it. Best of class!!!</li>
    <li> The soap is very perfumed, to much for our liking. The cream was no so bad.</li>
    <li> Great delivered on time and tenia versicolor rash was gone with in two uses of both. Still have white spots though</li>
    <li> Great for my skin and hair.  Ok smell.</li>
    <li> Not only were the key elements of customer service, delivery and packing of the products outstanding, the products are very, very effective. I would highly recommend the 10% Sulfur-Ointment + 3% Salicylic Acid SAL3 Soap and the 10% Sulfur Butter Cream &#x27;n Ointment to anyone having a skin condition that would require the use of this soap.</li>
    <li> This is much cheaper the buying it at pharmacy!!  Strongly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this...I used the soap twice (I did not try the ointment...)...&lt;br /&gt;The soap has a slight disgusting perfume fragrance but the STENCH of the sulfur in the soap is OVERPOWERING!!!!&lt;br /&gt;(it stinks like burning hair...BUT WORSE!!!)...&lt;br /&gt;I just used this on my face only for shaving irritation....&lt;br /&gt;I was sitting in my car later after using this freaking out WHAT IS THAT STENCH? It was this soap....&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed this unique disgusting odor on other people...Now I know what it was....&lt;br /&gt;I would AVOID this because of the overpowering disgusting STENCH!!!I</li>
    <li> Have really enjoyed this set!</li>
    <li> It seemed to work and I thought put the end to the little buggers.  have not seen any since have a good one</li>
    <li> Is working great. The itchi rash is slowly going away and I will order more for future use.</li>
    <li> This gave us so much relief, so quickly. I preferred to use the bar, by taking a shower, drying off, and then covering myself with it and leaving it on. My wife used the butter and gets about 6 full body coverings for each 2 oz container. The bar is more cost affective and seems to go deeper into the skin, but the soap is much easier to put on and much nicer on the skin. My wife and I have used about 5 sulfur butters and 1 bar in the last 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> Thank you sent I have been using this sulfur and the wash bar I can see a great difference I contract scabies from a department store&lt;br /&gt;Sent I been using this sulfur I have seen a great difference thank you  would I come back yes I will continue to come back  I must say a ,5 star</li>
    <li> This really worked when NOTHING else I had tried would.  I had a rash on my elbows that I had treated with poison ivy meds...all kinds of &#x27;miracle&#x27; oils...even tried athletes feet cream...nothing worked.  Then I tried this on them...and within a week...it was entirely healed and gone!  Don&#x27;t know why...really don&#x27;t care...IT JUST DID!</li>
    <li> As far as sulfur products, it is a sulfur product.</li>
    <li> very good for itchy scalp.I would keep on using it.</li>
    <li> While I was waiting to get my order. I used peroxide and put coconut oil on. It seemed to do help with the itching until my order arrived. The cream feels very soothing.</li>
    <li> This ointment.terrible . It smells awful, the&lt;br /&gt;consistency&lt;br /&gt;is sticky and grainy. st made my skin red and blotchy - and oneeye became swollen. - I would give it 1 star unless a minus one star is allowed,</li>
    <li> This is a really good product and it does what it says defenily recommend it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 63 years old and I have had dry scalp for as far back as I can remember. For the last few years the dry scales have spread to the inside of my ears, in my eyebrows, and along my hairline. It was driving me crazy! After trying every kind of shampoo and creams (even prescription), I did some research and discovered all of the advantages of using sulphur. I am so glad I ordered the Sal3 soap and the sulphur butter. They work like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;Now I will be able to wear dark colors without the snow on my shoulders.</li>
    <li> Great products, really took care of some skin issues I was having.</li>
    <li> This sulphur treatment has helped one of my children&#x27;s dandruff and acne tremendously - we will definitely be buying more.</li>
    <li> The treatment worked amazing to eradicate the eczema!  I am also, a health care provider in a local emergency room and often exposed to scabies etc.  10% sulfa is a second line treatment for scabies and there are many evidence based studies supporting the use in individual&#x27;s who can not tolerate prescription meds!  In fact, I have referred those patients to using 10% sulfa!</li>
    <li> Loved it. Moistures but clears skin! Amazing</li>
    <li> This is the dynamic duo! I love this Sulphur butter, I call it my &amp;#34;beauty butter&amp;#34; because it has cleared my adult acne 100% it makes my skin so soft, and pretty. My pores are small and  my acne is clear. I highly recommend this to anyone who has acne. And I also use a face &amp;#34;scrub pad&amp;#34; to lather my soap with, it really gets deep down in your pores that way and gets all of the &amp;#34;junk&amp;#34; outta your skin!</li>
    <li> I washed my feet with the soap then I put the cream on my feet after they dried. I had some really nasty itching between my toes, on the bottom of my feet and on  the heals. It is gone completely now! I was amazed to see this product do more for my feet than any antifungal products I have tried. Give it try before running to the drug store!</li>
    <li> I think it made my rash worst the soap dried out my skin made me itchy the creamer I like for my hair but thats it.</li>
    <li> Helped my itchy skin after first usage.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have little bumps on the side of my cheeks. At first I broke out but not for long within a week everything was gone all new and old acne. I highly recommend this to anyone  having those few blemishes that just won&#x27;t budge.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product whether it&#x27;s used to help keep skin clear or for scabies.  I love the soap because it leaves my skin soft and clean, and not dried-out.  I do intend to buy more of the soap to use on my face.  I suggest you give it a try.</li>
    <li> This sulfur is the best!!! I purchased this because of scabies. I soaked in hot water and 30 mins and scrubed my skin. I washed my hair with this soap and let the soap sit in my hair for 30 mins b4 rinsing the soap out. I used the ointment for the most itchy areas. Also my son has horrible acne, patches of bumps and white heads every where. After using this for 2 days his acne is clearing up. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone with any of the above issues. Also it smells good and my skin is soft</li>
    <li> great does what it says it will do</li>
    <li> Kinda stinky, but effective... I think! :/</li>
    <li> this is a great product IF you use it regularly....knowwhatimean?  Yikes!  Why is it so hard to get men to develop new routine&#x27;s?  :-)</li>
    <li> Works great for my daughter acne.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for the acne. The butter made them worse Soap is just OK, not really very effective</li>
    <li> Highly recommend:)!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Tried with my dog&#x27;s itching but did not help any.</li>
    <li> Very happy with results, helped a lot with the rash on my leg.  Devilvered promptly and completely as advertised</li>
    <li> Fast shipping sulfur cream good for face excelant for mites on humans !</li>
    <li> I started using this sulfur soap a few months ago as a last ditch effort to clearing up adult acne I got about 6 months ago &amp; it worked!</li>
    <li> As expected, but may not have been very effective on my scalp.</li>
    <li> not enough cream in the container. photo is deceiving.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working.. after 3 days of using this product the scabies are dying. Im luck that caught them early cuz  i would&#x27;ve bin going crazy with hundreds of them in me. Yuk... anyways it works buy it.. Its worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This product is saving my skin! I used to use Pan-Oxyl when I was in my 20&#x27;s because that was what worked for me then. I had gone decades without problems, so when my skin started breaking out again over the past 4 months, I went back to it but found it too drying. I decided to give sulfur and salicylic acid a try. The bar soap lathers well after wetting it properly (as recommended in directions) and has a pleasing scent. The Sulfur Butter is &amp;#34;whipped&amp;#34; in appearance and, while I was concerned about putting a lot of oils on my skin, the results have been phenomenal. After the first day, a few more pimples showed up. I expected that they were going to because they were already waiting in my skin to erupt later on. The combination of these two products have worked to exfoliate, hydrate and unclog my pores. My skin is smoothing out after just one week. No new outbreaks at all and the redness is disappearing after months of embarrassing acne. My husband remarked that I &amp;#34;smelled like Happy Jack,&amp;#34; an old sulfur remedy for dog mange. My son asked why I &amp;#34;smelled like a cap-gun.&amp;#34; I had to laugh. I do get whiffs of the sulfur from time to time throughout the day, but I&#x27;d rather smell like Happy Jack than look like I had mange, which actually describes my skin pretty well before I started using these products. So thankful to have found these items and at such a great price.</li>
    <li> We are satisfied with both products. The sulfur doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell. It&#x27;s quite pleasant.</li>
    <li> My face feels so smooth after using this soap. And the sulfur butter helps the acne mature faster.</li>
    <li> Excellent shipping! The soap really helped me with calming down the itching. I bought this soap to help with scabies. I&#x27;ve had them for a couple of months and was really trying to find something that would help with the itching. The soap does have a different smell to it but not as bad as I expected. Have not tried the sulfur butter it came with but the soap is excellent! It also helped clear up some body acne I had. Soap lathers up well.  I am using this soap in conjunction with prescribed medication and lotion for scabies from the doctor. I bought 3 sets of these for my brother and sister as it seemed they were experiencing some itching as well and they are no longer itchy after using the soap everyday for two weeks. Definitely recommend this product</li>
