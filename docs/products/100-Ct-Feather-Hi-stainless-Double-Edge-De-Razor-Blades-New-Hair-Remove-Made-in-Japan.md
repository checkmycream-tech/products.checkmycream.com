      <li>, I find that they dull faster than most other blades.  </li>

<li> There are no other DE blades made as sharp and with the factory quality control as Feather.</li>

<li> was going to take an extraordinarily long time so its really not their fault.</li>
<li> sometime mid to late next year.  </li>

<li> Never a issue and always sharp.</li>
<li> 2 months is average time customer service told me as the blades were coming from Thailand;  although customer service via email was prompt and curious</li>
<li> Sharp</li>
<li> this co. Be prepared for rediculous wait times &amp; no tracking info; which for me was the most annoying issue.</li>
<li> Its crazy thinking that a pack of blades I purchased for roughly $30 in August of 2013 will last me until next August 2014.  </li>
<li> The least expensive way to shave if you can&#x27;t or don&#x27;t want to use a straight razor.</li>
<li> If I we were still using a cartridge razors, we would be spending at least $30 a month.  </li>
<li> This makes it a poor value blade for me.  </li>
<li> You will not be disappointed!</li>

    <li> I believe these are not real Feather brand blades. They arrived from Thailand. They are chewing up my face at the 3rd shave. The real Feather blades I have last 5 or 6 shaves.</li>
    <li> Sharp but I have used sharper and longer lasting blades.</li>
    <li> Everyones face and hair combination is different, and so everyone should try more than one type of razor blade before determining if double edge shaving is for them.  I tried every blade in one of the 30 blade samplers, and without question these razors gave me the best possible shave with the least amount of irritation.  At my previous job, I had to be clean shaven 24/7, and these are the only blades that would keep me facial hair free without turning my neck into ground beef.  These blades are a life saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some persuading, I was also able to get my girlfriend to switch to shaving with a double edge razor, and she loves these blades too.  Now that we are both using the same blades, based off our usage, I think we&#x27;ll have to re-order sometime mid to late next year.  Its crazy thinking that a pack of blades I purchased for roughly $30 in August of 2013 will last me until next August 2014.  If I we were still using a cartridge razors, we would be spending at least $30 a month.  But don&#x27;t misunderstand me, don&#x27;t even think of the word &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; because that would be misleading.  These are high quality, inexpensive blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone looking for the opportunity to save some money, and have a better shave.</li>
    <li> Very long wait for free delivery but the actual razors are great</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because the company does not provide tracking numbers and the wait time is to long for me. 2 months is average time customer service told me as the blades were coming from Thailand;  although customer service via email was prompt and curious also I understand coming from Thailand via regular post was going to take an extraordinarily long time so its really not their fault. The razors came in good condition as advertised but; if anyone wants to order anything from this co. Be prepared for rediculous wait times &amp; no tracking info; which for me was the most annoying issue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While they all work, Feather is the best by far.  Sharpest, which translates into most comfortable, and longest lasting.  Only one I buy.</li>
    <li> Takes a few shaved to &amp;#34;get it&amp;#34; that the Feather brand puts out VERY sharp blades so that one develops the right shaving routine.  Using water that&#x27;s hot enough and wet lather made and applied with a shaving brush Feather blades give an excellent shave without carving chunks out of one&#x27;s face.</li>
    <li> The bast razor blade ever? Can&#x27;t say for sure, but it&#x27;s easily the sharpest double edge blade I can find. You can find cheaper blades, but blades seven shaves easily before a change.</li>
    <li> Best and sharpest on the market, lasts one week easily.</li>
    <li> Feather perfect DE blades</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the product.  Actually arrived  early!</li>
    <li> A great deal on ridiculously sharp razor blades.  the 100 pack is as shown, in the cardboard retail packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does ship from Thailand - the shipper that I purchased from did not require a signature, making this purchase particularly easy.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Sharp blades for a smooth shave.  Product was delivered as scheduled, be patient if you are ordering from the USA, as this is shipped from overseas.  Product was packaged nicely by seller.  No complaints.  Feather makes the BEST DE razor blades, and I use nothing else.  You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Shaving with a fresh feather blade is a joy.  Sharp, cuts close, smooth, great shave, however, because they are so sharp, I find that they dull faster than most other blades.  This makes it a poor value blade for me.  I can get 3 or more shaves from other blades, while only one good shave from a feather.  To costly to change a blade every day, therefore only 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Best blades money can buy.</li>
    <li> There are no other DE blades made as sharp and with the factory quality control as Feather. I&#x27;m not saying a young man with softer whiskers could do as well with a different blade but Feathers are the best gents. Be careful they&#x27;re sharp.</li>
    <li> What can I say? Feather&#x27;s are the sharpest, if that&#x27;s your cup of tea.</li>
    <li> The least expensive way to shave if you can&#x27;t or don&#x27;t want to use a straight razor. I love these blades they are the best and this is the third batch of 100 counts I have bought and used. Never a issue and always sharp.</li>
    <li> Arrived more quickly than I expected. Packaged well, and was just what we expected. My husband uses them with his Merkur Heavy Duty Double Edge Razor.</li>
    <li> Great deal.  And excellent razor</li>
    <li> These are the best blades found so far.</li>
    <li> I do like these razors very much. It takes quite awhile to receive them, however package was in good condition and complete.</li>
