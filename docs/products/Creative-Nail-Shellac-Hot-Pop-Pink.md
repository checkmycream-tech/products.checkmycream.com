<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love the CND shellack products because of the ease of removing the product plus the length of time the shellack products last.</li>
    <li> Great polish...only wish it was a little more fluorescent colored, but still a good bright pink. Great for spring and summer.</li>
    <li> This color is just as named-hot pink. A great color for summer. It arrived on time &amp; in great condition.</li>
    <li> I think this color shines brighter with the UV light used and duller with the LED light use</li>
    <li> I just bought the whole system after spending hundreds of dollars in salon manicures.  I absolutely love it! This is the first color I purchased and it is beautiful.  I have had my color on for 8 days and still looks great, other than the little growth at the bottom.  I think I will take off at 2 weeks just because of that, but feel that it would last even longer with a more neutral color. Cant wait to try more colors!</li>
    <li> I love this color, it reminded me of Barbie Pink and was just the color I was looking for. It ends up looking glossy but with out that shimmery look to it. Great summer color but I think its a good all year round color as well if your really into the girly colors.</li>
    <li> I love the Shellac system, and tried this color recently. I expected a \\&quot;hotter\\&quot; pink, this is more a bubblegum shade, and it definitely does not have a shimmer. But I still really like it!</li>
    <li> This pink is amazing and bright. Looks great with a coat of Zillionaire over it as well to make it a little more funky.</li>
    <li> The hot pop pink is a great color, very bright. Good price, too. I got my first shellac manicure done at a salon, but it&#x27;s expensive. Regular manicures only last a couple of days and I wanted something that lasted longer. I really like this product. I&#x27;m a stay at home mom and I&#x27;m always washing my hands, doing dishes, laundry, and everything else. I don&#x27;t have the time to redo my nails every couple of days so I thought this would be great and worth the investment. I just received everything and completed my manicure last night. So far so good. My manicure from the salon was a french manicure and it only lasted 1 week, but I think that was my fault. Lots of cleaning and I didn&#x27;t use gloves. I&#x27;m really hoping this will last a least 2 weeks. Right now I&#x27;m giving a 5 star, but may update depending on chipping.  I purchased the uv lamp, base and top coat, and 3 nail colors. The price after shipping is equal to 5 trips to the salon with tip. It will defiantly pay for itself.</li>
    <li> Nice color. Not add bright and hot pink as expected.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this color! It goes on like a dream! It is the perfect bright hot pink I love it soooo much!</li>
    <li> This color is true to the bottle: it goes on the exact same color and shade as the bottle. It is a very summertime, feminine hot pink.    I am very happy with the gel nail color system. It really does last a long time. When it starts to come off (after about two weeks), it lifts up and breaks off in a chunk. It needs to be removed by soaking for 10 minutes in acetone, which makes my cuticles itch and really dries my skin. But I put on cuticle oil right away and moisturize with a heavy cream, and my nails are good as new after about a half hour. They don&#x27;t feel weak and brittle. On the other hand, I&#x27;ve never been able to keep my nails very long before shellac. They would easily break. Now the nail gel protects them and for the first time ever I have great nails.     I&#x27;m hooked on shellac and will never go back to regular nail polish!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year now and really like it.  I love to wear bright colors and this one is perfect.  I have almost used the entire bottle and will be getting it again.</li>
    <li> Did not respond well to the nail heat lamp that we have used on other polish. May work better to just air dry on its own.</li>
    <li> Love the vibrant color! Fun for the summer being so bright! Works awesome! A must buy for those shellac lovers!</li>
    <li> Love CND Shellac polish. This is a pretty pink great for spring or summer. The polish lasts for weeks without chipping.</li>
    <li> The tutti frutti is a better color if you ask me.</li>
    <li> Nice color.  The color last about three weeks on my nail. Happy with this product. Would buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> Khaki bkj bib khb kh khb I hbkhb khb khb khb khb khb high hi hbjh bkj bib kb hbkhb khb k</li>
    <li> The product arrived in 28 days.The package was all right;I&#x27;ve tried it and it lasts 20 days!!really good product and I&#x27;m really satisfeid!!The only thing was that the colour was not the same i&#x27;ve choose and i&#x27;ve seen on photos here on amazon..it was more light than i&#x27;ve seen on my friend</li>
    <li> Great color and wonderful product</li>
    <li> Fast shipping on a great product!</li>
    <li> I thought this would be too dark but I love it. Plus it will cover in one coat which I love. This is a med pink on the blue side, no orange and it&#x27;s not too bright, just a nice color..</li>
    <li> The color is fabulous!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, amazing product my daughters loved it. We purchased the shellac products and it&#x27;s cheaper to do it at home vs the salon.</li>
    <li> This is a bright pink color with a shimmer.  Love the color for summer.  Love the shellac nail polish system.  Had my first shellac done at a salon and felt I could do it myself.  Bought all the necessities and now I am able to do myself!  The polish wears great and does last at least 2 weeks!</li>
    <li> I love the Hot Pop Pink color!  It is very vibrant and matches the bottle color closely, LOVE Shellac polish!</li>
    <li> lasts for 2 weeks.  Looks great- The product came quickly.  Try laying it with a soft color to make it appear less bold.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT-NAILS LAST APPROX 2 WEEKS-YOU DO NEED A PROPER UV LAMP TO CURE-WATCH THE VIDEOS ON THEIR SITE FOR PROPER APPLICATION-COMES OFF VERY EASY WITH LITTLE TO NO DAMAGE TO NAILS--LOVE--LOVE--LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Pretty color very vibrant will look great in summer months ver eye catching went on smooth and opaque. Try it</li>
    <li> I really wanted a shellac polish to do at home, but when I got it, I didn&#x27;t realize that the manicure didn&#x27;t work without the uv machine.</li>
    <li> This polish was a little bit cheaper (after paying s/h) than what my local beauty supply store was charging. Other than that...product was fine.</li>
    <li> Love CND, not my favorite color.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in hopes of saving money and&lt;br /&gt;doing my nails at home.  Color is great, and it goes&lt;br /&gt;on good.  However, when I received my bottle it was&lt;br /&gt;not \\&quot;full\\&quot;.  I order several bottles of Creative&lt;br /&gt;CND and upon looking inside bottles noticed that&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;all were only half full\\&quot;.  Also the polish chips&lt;br /&gt;within the first week.  Never had that problems&lt;br /&gt;when having them done at salon until about the second&lt;br /&gt;week.  So in the long run after purchasing polish,&lt;br /&gt;top coat, base, and lamp, just do not feel like&lt;br /&gt;I saved any money. Leave it to the professionals.</li>
    <li> Very pretty color, a nice basic hot pink. No surprises here, its not too neon, or too bland, just right. Loved it with matte top coat also.</li>
    <li> Beautiful nail color! Fast shipping. Grade AAA</li>
    <li> I am a nail tech and have all the CND shellac colors. this one was the last one i needed to complete my set. All of them are beautiful!</li>
    <li> Gorgeous! Get complements all the time:-)</li>
    <li> Not the real deal... A copy that takes longer to dry &amp; lumpy, so was really disappointed cause I love the colour.</li>
    <li> I Love this product, I just thought the color would be brighter. The color on the bottle is very misleading</li>
    <li> i receive it in very good conditions</li>
    <li> Product arrived fast and as promised. This color is great- especially for your toes. Rich coat, has great staying power and very rich finish.</li>
    <li> Hands down my favorite. Almost time to get another one already. I use all kinds of additives with this one and by itself.</li>
    <li> This is a very fun color! It is a very vibrant pink color. The color pops and last for about 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Pretty color. Just wish it was a little brighter.</li>
    <li> I love the pink, it really pops! I also like the CND Shellac products a lot! Highly recommended for those who love pink!</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t go back to regular polish again.  I love doing my nails and it lasting for two weeks.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I love this color it&#x27;s pretty and and long lasting I love shellac even though it&#x27;s hard on the nails</li>
    <li> Pink is not my favorite color.  I like a coral better.</li>
    <li> It shipped to me very quickly. I love the  color, nice spring color. I polished going on 2 weeks, still looks like the day i applied it. love this product!!</li>
    <li> This is the first time that I have tried a Creative Nail  Design product.  It has good coverage with just one coat. The color last a lot longer than other nail products I have tried in the past. As far as fading and chipping it surpasses the other competition. I believe I have found my new favorite nail product.</li>
    <li> I bought a system including a [[ASIN:B001RMP7M6 Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer]] with CND base and top coats about six months ago.  Hot Pop Pink applies smooth and evenly.  Opaque, bright, medium pink with no shimmer.  Lasted a full two weeks.</li>
    <li> The color is hot pink just as the name of it. It is very close in color to Tutti Fruiti with the exception of missing sparkles or pear tint in it and little calmer. Definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> Great Product.. Great Shipping Thanks...</li>
    <li> Description is correct, do not need to repeat it all, nothing bad, fits well, good quality, nothing to complain about... recommended!</li>
    <li> I think its a cool color, will be better in the summer though. Will be good to mix with as well.</li>
    <li> I got this color a couple of weeks ago and used it as a base color with black pool on the tips, looks great.  My only complaint is that it is not as bright of a pink as I would have liked, I wouldn&#x27;t call it hot pink.</li>
    <li> I needed a spring color and this is the perfect bright pink! I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on this new color.</li>
    <li> This color is true to the bottle color.  I think this is a very pretty color.  This was a definite must have color.</li>
    <li> This color is so beautiful!! Love using it  and it lasts for at least 2 weeks, sometimes longer. Thanks for saving me the trips to the salon!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter is all about the pink so what&#x27;s not to like about HOT POP PINK!!  Love Shellac and everything comes quickly from Creative Nail Design.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product!</li>
    <li> I love it, came quickly</li>
