      <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with the X-Fusion product and have been ordering light brown.  </li>
      <li>I use a powder on my scalp first (Joan Rivers Great Hair Day), and then style my hair how I want it.</li>
      <li>With the thinning of my hair on top, I needed something and this is it.</li>

      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>This product has more than met my expectations.  </li>
      <li>being said, this is a nice quick way to cover up all the gray roots that are so resistant to color.</li>
      <li>been great for me as it looks natural</li>
      <li>It stays on, its easy to apply, etc.</li>
      <li>My beautician introduced me to it, it is easy to use and works as promised.</li>

      <li>For my particular hair color, the light brown has been the best so far.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s virtually undetectable once applied and lightly combed in.</li>
      <li>This is a great product that actually works.</li>
      <li>XFusion really changed my life!!!</li>
      <li>I buy both medium blonde and light brown, and sprinkle them on separately, and that gives the hair more dimension.</li>
      <li>Shake right out of the can .</li>
      <li>Company ships very fast.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s ridiculously easy to use and and only takes a minute or two.</li>

      <li>I have bought the medium brown, light brown and now the medium blonde.</li>
      <li>I really like this</li>
      <li>I have very thinning hair ...</li>
      <li>Ihave used this product before and will continue to use it as long as it is available.</li>
      <li>Have tried several similar products, and this is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to anyone with thinning hair.</li>
      <li>Would be nice if they had a dark blonde choice</li>
      <li>It really helps fill-in the thinning area and also helps absorb oils too and really helps until my next hair appointment too</li>
      <li>People say they&#x27;re the same product under a different name, but both products are available.</li>
      <li>WOW!  </li>
      <li>, this looks and acts exactly the same.</li>
      <li>My hair never came back very well after chemo and it was rather embarrassing.  </li>
      <li>This product does not cover grey roots on medium, golden blonde hair.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m in between the medium blonde and light brown, so I buy one of each, and mix them into a larger container of the product that I had previously bought.</li>
      <li>As a matter of fact, no one who doesn&#x27;t know me can tell that I have thin hair directly on top of my head.</li>
      <li>just a spritz, right before application, and a little bit afterwards also, to hold it.</li>
      <li>I have golden brown hair, and i thought medium blonde would be a match, but when applied this is a very dark brown and did not blend in at all.</li>
      <li>The medium blonde is a little too light and not really gold enough to blend with the depth</li>

<li> What a difference, I was very unhappy with my hair because as you get older your hair thins and your scalp shows.  </li>

    <li> My hair stylist  turned me on to this product when I stated to loose my hair&lt;br /&gt;Its been great for me as it looks natural and you can tell  I am using it&lt;br /&gt;Now i am sold on XFusion.</li>
    <li> I had been using the med brown which I was very happy with. Then I decided to mix 2 tsps med brown with 1tsp auburn and 1 tsps med blonde. Now I have a perfect match!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the little puffer. It does take a little getting used to but I will say I am VERY happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a number of years I have been extremely selfconcious about my &amp;#34;balding look&amp;#34;. It is heartbreaking to me and makes be so embarrased to go out in public. I have so little hair!. Now I style my hair ( as best I can ) and puff around with the XFusion. OMG I have my dignity back!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do be careful to use a damp wash cloth around the hair line to wipe away any extra that has gotten where it shouldn&#x27;t. But the end result will change your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can go to work or anywhere and not feel like everyone is just noticing my head and not the rest of me.</li>
    <li> love it and the service was great.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> I really like this since my hair is thinning , it does not stay in your when its windy you do have to use more than once a day but I still love it</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It also helps cover gray roots. I didn&#x27;t have any itching issues and it stays well.</li>
    <li> I could not live without this product. I use it every day to make my hair appear less thin. As a matter of fact, no one who doesn&#x27;t know me can tell that I have thin hair directly on top of my head. Great product!</li>
    <li> Ihave used this product before and will continue to use it as long as it is available. It works perfectly fine in covering thinning hair or bald spots. I recommend it. It works for men and women as well.</li>
    <li> I have used x.fusion for years,not that I want to,but I find it&#x27;s best for my thinning female baldness problem...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the X-Fusion product and have been ordering light brown.  Since I have my hair tipped in blonde, my hairdresser suggested I go lighter--so I did. Didn&#x27;t work out for me so I&#x27;ll be going one shade deeper next time.</li>
    <li> Last winter I had some surgery, twice.  The anesthesia put my hair folicles to sleep, and I thought they were gone for good.  My hair is growing back, and this fills in the thin spots.  For my strawberry blond hair, I use Auburn on the roots then a dusting of Medium Blond to make the whole head of hair look thicker.  Doesn&#x27;t shed or drip.  Comes out when you wash it out.</li>
    <li> XFusion really changed my life!!! And it&#x27;s ridiculously easy to use and and only takes a minute or two. Try it!!!</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and has fairly good coverage...would like to see more variety in colors and have it adhere better to the hair/scalp</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product to help your hair do look &amp;#34;fuller&amp;#34;.  Its like magic-shake it on and it changes your look!  No &amp;#34;powders&amp;#34; that leaks out any where.  Its a lifesaver for fine thin hair!</li>
    <li> This was recommended by a friend I work with and I thank the day she introduced it to me.  When my roots (they are gray) come in it give an appearance of thinning hair.  Now I use Xfusion and not only does it hide the appearance of sparse hair but it also adds color which perfectly matches my blond color and therefore I can wait longer to color roots.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that actually works. Company ships very fast.</li>
    <li> This product has more than met my expectations.  Instead of feeling constantly self-conscious, my confidence has been restored. I am so glad I discovered XFusion!</li>
    <li> I am so glad my sister-in-law told me about xfusion!  It covers my thinning spots wonderfully! This will be a regular purchase for me!</li>
    <li> This product is a hair saver.  My hair never came back very well after chemo and it was rather embarrassing.  This product works wonderful to thicken the hair strands and cover the scalp showing through and looks natural.</li>
    <li> This is the third container of this stuff I have purchased. Also it is the third color I have tried. I have bought the medium brown, light brown and now the medium blonde. For my particular hair color, the light brown has been the best so far. The medium blonde is a little too light and not really gold enough to blend with the depth I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this is a nice quick way to cover up all the gray roots that are so resistant to color. It stays on, its easy to apply, etc. I do experiment with a variety of products, and this is one of the most effective. Price could be better....</li>
    <li> WOW!  What a difference, I was very unhappy with my hair because as you get older your hair thins and your scalp shows.  Since I started using this I don&#x27;t even think about it anymore, my hair looks a lot fuller and you can not see my scalp:-)</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this to anyone with thinning hair.My beautician introduced me to it, it is easy to use and works as promised.</li>
    <li> I have very thinning hair ...The XFusion fills in the area where the scalp can be seen.</li>
    <li> a little messy, I think I prefer the brush on types</li>
    <li> Great stuff to cover bald spots. I use a powder on my scalp first (Joan Rivers Great Hair Day), and then style my hair how I want it. Then I go back and sprinkle this product on the parts that are super thin that you can see my scalp. Between both products, I have camouflaged my scalp well. It&#x27;s virtually undetectable once applied and lightly combed in. I use regular hair spray-- just a spritz, right before application, and a little bit afterwards also, to hold it. Doesn&#x27;t come off on pillow cases or anything. Only comes off in the shower, or if you have to scratch your head.... you will feel it collect under your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use Toppik sometimes, this looks and acts exactly the same. People say they&#x27;re the same product under a different name, but both products are available. I get whichever is cheapest at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in between the medium blonde and light brown, so I buy one of each, and mix them into a larger container of the product that I had previously bought. Would be nice if they had a dark blonde choice so I didn&#x27;t have to do that. That&#x27;s why I only give 4 and not 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Works great to hide bald spots</li>
    <li> It is the best product. My hairdresser suggested it and I had my doubt&#x27;s but it work so great I can&#x27;t believe it. Shake right out of the can . It has made me feel better about my looks.</li>
    <li> I lost my hairline, due to medications, and this does help hide the \\&quot;sparse spots\\&quot;.It also matches my rather odd colored blonde hair well enough--most do not</li>
    <li> It really helps fill-in the thinning area and also helps absorb oils too and really helps until my next hair appointment too</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price. Received it on time.</li>
    <li> Have tried several similar products, and this is my favorite.  I buy both medium blonde and light brown, and sprinkle them on separately, and that gives the hair more dimension.</li>
    <li> This is probably the fifth time I have purchased this.  Great product for those weeks just before your &#x27;root touch ups&#x27;.</li>
    <li> This product does not cover grey roots on medium, golden blonde hair.  I kept applying more hoping that might do the trick - it did not.</li>
    <li> I have golden brown hair, and i thought medium blonde would be a match, but when applied this is a very dark brown and did not blend in at all.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. With the thinning of my hair on top, I needed something and this is it. It makes me not so self-conscience.</li>
