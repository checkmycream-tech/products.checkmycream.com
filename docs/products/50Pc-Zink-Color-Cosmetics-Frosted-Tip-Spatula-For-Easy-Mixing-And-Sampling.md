      <li>Maybe my dislike for this product is my own fault for not carefully considering the dimensions posted, but these things are TINY!  </li>
      <li>VERY reuseable if you are of the mind</li>

      <li>The only cosmetics spatulas I&#x27;ve found are tiny, flimsy and only good for disposable use.  </li>
      <li>These are exactly what I expected and needed to create samples for my customers in a clean hygienic way.  </li>
      <li>These spatulas are a decent length (3 inches) to grab hold of and have some heft to them, so they can be washed and reused</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>LOVE these little spatulas.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and keep my fingers out of my cosmetic containers at all times, so I needed a product like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These came in a white, not the clear frosted color.  </li>

<li> Well, these little paddles will keep that from happening.  </li>
<li> Just what I needed for  my small business!</li>
<li> These spatulas are very, very small.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t you hate it when you dip your fingers into a jar of makeup and get a load of the makeup under your nails?  </li>

    <li> Maybe my dislike for this product is my own fault for not carefully considering the dimensions posted, but these things are TINY!  I have a spatula that has the same shape as this that a girl at the Norsdstrom makeup counter gave to me with a sample.  I have loved using it since then and it recently went missing.  These, however, are barely wider than a toothpick and the end for dipping into the product is about half of my pinky nail.  They are also VERY short so it will not be good if your product container is anymore than an inch or two deep.</li>
    <li> Small than I thought but a great item.</li>
    <li> I love messing around with lotions and cosmetics, and these are great for blending.  They&#x27;re a nice weight of plastic and can be washed and reused (although I have a tendency to toss when done).  If anyone is really reading our emails and paying attention to what we buy online, they must think I&#x27;m a wicked coke addict.</li>
    <li> Love these. Great way to prevent contamination when saming beauty products. Great quality</li>
    <li> They were as sturdy as I wanted, but, they will work.</li>
    <li> These spatulas are very, very small.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and disposable.</li>
    <li> While these were not the spatulas I was looking for, they were exactly as described.  They met my expectations perfectly.</li>
    <li> Handy to use and arrived very quickly. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I use them for masks at home and concealers and foundations and cremes that are in pots. They work great but honestly...q tips are cheaper and I could use them for most of what I do unless I am mixing something.</li>
    <li> Perfect sample spatulas.</li>
    <li> I Love these.  I use them to get my face lotion from the jar.  I have long nails, so this works out great for me, rather than getting lotion under  my nails.</li>
    <li> These are exactly what I expected and needed to create samples for my customers in a clean hygienic way.  I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for  my small business!</li>
    <li> They were way smaller then I thought they&#x27;d be.</li>
    <li> The only cosmetics spatulas I&#x27;ve found are tiny, flimsy and only good for disposable use.  These spatulas are a decent length (3 inches) to grab hold of and have some heft to them, so they can be washed and reused easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years ago when I sold cosmetics, I was taught that fingers in jars will not just contaminate the product, but actually change the chemical balance and make your products ineffective.  I have very sensitive skin and keep my fingers out of my cosmetic containers at all times, so I needed a product like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased - priced right, exactly what I was looking for, and they come in a nice slide/zip pouch.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These came in a white, not the clear frosted color.  And these were slightly different than shown.  Still useful, but I ended up finding the exact ones pictured at a cosmetic supplier.</li>
    <li> Works great for my business. I give one free with all my sugar scrubs. I love the pouch to keep them contained too.  Great price!</li>
    <li> LOVE these little spatulas.  Use them to apply healing ointment without having to use my fingers and contaminate the contents.  VERY reuseable if you are of the mind but cheap enough to just throw away.  If I every get through this bunch I will definately be ordering again.</li>
    <li> They are great and just what they were advertised . Price was good, they came promptly and I was very happy with them</li>
    <li> Perfect for getting face cream out of container and not contaminating it with your fingers !</li>
    <li> These paddles are perfect for cosmetic jars when you want to keep fingers out of the contents.  Good quality, sturdy.</li>
    <li> If you have long fingernails (or medium length nails for that fact), these are a must.

It also keeps the remainder of the makeup in the jar, germ free.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed! I used to find something similar to these at Sally&#x27;s, but they stopped carrying them. Thank you!</li>
