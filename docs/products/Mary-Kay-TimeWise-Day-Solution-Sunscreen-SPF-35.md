      <li>I thought this was more moisturizer than sun screen, my mistake but its very nice and smooth on the face</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d be spending more than $50.00 a month on this.</li>
      <li>This is a really nice, light, under make-up sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>I am satisfied.  </li>

      <li>This item was just ok.</li>
      <li>I love this sunscreen/day solution.</li>
      <li>ok that all i want to say</li>
      <li>Lovely cream</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic sunscreen!  </li>
      <li>On top of that, some sunscreen products irritate my face, giving a burning sensation.  </li>
      <li>which is one of my biggest complaints with most sunscreens.  </li>
      <li>:)  )</li>
      <li>It is okay, but I won&#x27;t repurchase it.</li>
      <li>I love the top pump.</li>
      <li>it was more of a lotion consistency.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my 70&#x27;s and most people think my skin looks as though I were 45.  </li>
      <li>I love Mary Kay and have been using it for 30 years.  </li>
      <li>However, the Day Solution is nothing more than a fancy sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>I was very happy with this purchase until I flipped over the day the day solution and saw that the product expires next month.&lt;br /&gt;Im</li>
      <li>I love the Mary Kay Timewise line.  </li>
      <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I love the way it smells and works on my face.  </li>
      <li>Though I ordered the 25, and received the 35, it turned out ok.  </li>
      <li>Good quality, fast service, item is as described.</li>
      <li>SPF 15 and 25 were both excellent products and left my face smooth and clean</li>
      <li>Easy to apply and not greasy.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s easy to accidentally spill.</li>
      <li>The sunscreen is not sticky and easy to spread on my skin.  </li>
      <li>she loved it and it got here super fast!  </li>
      <li>Lucky me!</li>
      <li>While most of us don&#x27;t bother, you really should wear something like this anytime you&#x27;re going to be out in the sun.</li>
      <li>, it doesn&#x27;t give you that super \\&quot;white\\&quot; look, either.  </li>
      <li>I love it and would highly recommend it to others.</li>
      <li>I recently got to try a bunch of Mary Kay cosmetics and have been very pleased with all of them.  </li>
      <li>I like it because it&#x27;s not heavy and greasy like many sunscreens</li>
      <li>I would love to see a redesign of the dispenser, but until then I&#x27;ll just unscrew the cap and use it the old fashioned way.  </li>
      <li>I would never buy it on its own outside of the set.  </li>
      <li>Please sell the right product.</li>
      <li>This product is very gentle.    </li>
      <li>/&gt;Since the normal return screens give me a note of \\&quot;special handling contact CS\\</li>
      <li>I have to use more to get enough moisture and as a result I go through it a lot faster.</li>
      <li>The first time I got some 35 through a consultant, I returned it because it was so runny.  </li>
      <li>I like it enough to keep using it until I find something else I like better.</li>
      <li>This seemed to be more watery than ones I have had before.so will look for different vendor.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly, is not greasy, and contains lots of antioxidants that are good for the skin.  </li>
      <li>The thing is that the product is been good for many years but the dealer shop that I bought they sent the wrong one I specified that I want the sp 25 and been three times sending me the sp 35</li>
      <li>I received the 35 this time on this order and the consistency was not thick by any means but was not too runny as the first one had been.  </li>
      <li>I have used the &#x27;25&#x27; before and it works really well.</li>
      <li>thanks to</li>
      <li>It was a cross between a light lotion and sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much for sending it promptly and working with us.</li>
      <li>Basically, you are paying for a very fancy bottle.  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy and the price is reasonable.</li>
      <li>It works really well</li>
      <li>, I really like</li>
      <li>Would like to make this my regular, everyday face sunscreen/moisturizer, but at $21.84 an ounce (and Amazon&#x27;s price is good)</li>
      <li>Great for everyday (but not for swimming or other sports activities).  </li>
      <li>This sunscreen is light, thin, and goes on my face smoothly.  </li>
      <li>I love Mary Kay products because it is one of the few lines that my sensitive skin can handle.  </li>
      <li>I have trouble with most Sunscreen moisturizers burning my eyes even if I don&#x27;t get it near them.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>Makes my face shiny and greesy and it burns my sensitive skin</li>
      <li>not one to chance using face lotion after its expiration date because I have sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>(75 years young and no face wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>The product is high quality and it is terrific to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I mean, when you pump the top, it literally comes out like WHITE WATER.</li>
      <li>, I will order the same product directly thru Mary Kay and compare it..</li>
      <li>The first few hours after application my face feels sticky.  </li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel fresh and protected everyday!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was a great find! It is difficult to run down a Mary Kay sales person and find time to meet to pick up the product. The product is high quality and it is terrific to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Excellent stuff.  Been using it for 15 years.  I&#x27;m in my 70&#x27;s and most people think my skin looks as though I were 45.  Lucky me!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use products that test on animals and especially products who lie about it. I use murad now. Try it.</li>
    <li> This product has met all my expectations since 2001.&lt;br /&gt;I recently met a elderly women of 70 yrs of age; that stated my complexion was flawless and ageless.&lt;br /&gt;She stated that I look like a woman of 50 years of age..........  I will be 70 years of age in September 2015.&lt;br /&gt;How can I express my gratitude; except to say I will continue using this product until The Lord calls me home.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen/day solution. It makes my skin feel fresh and protected everyday!</li>
    <li> I thought this was more moisturizer than sun screen, my mistake but its very nice and smooth on the face and I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with how quickly I got my Mary Kay products. The items were cheaper than getting them from a Mary Kay consultant and the package arrived in great condition. I was very happy with this purchase until I flipped over the day the day solution and saw that the product expires next month.&lt;br /&gt;Im not one to chance using face lotion after its expiration date because I have sensitive skin.  I will be discarding this when it expires and will not chance ordering another Mary Kay product on Amazon.</li>
    <li> What is not to like about Mary Kay. I have been using this product since son number 2was born, he&#x27;s 18 now.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice, light, under make-up sunscreen.  Goes on smoothly, is not greasy, and contains lots of antioxidants that are good for the skin.  Great for everyday (but not for swimming or other sports activities).  Would like to make this my regular, everyday face sunscreen/moisturizer, but at $21.84 an ounce (and Amazon&#x27;s price is good), I&#x27;m going to have to look elsewhere.  I&#x27;d be spending more than $50.00 a month on this. If you can afford it, I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been faithfully using Mary Kay TimeWise Day Solution for years.  SPF 15 and 25 were both excellent products and left my face smooth and clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product I just received is SPF 35. The lotion has a very thin consistency.  The first few hours after application my face feels sticky.  By the end of the day its moved to a greasy feeling. This is even with using less product than I had with the SPF 15 and 25 versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the normal return screens give me a note of \\&quot;special handling contact CS\\&quot; message, I have emailed Amazon asking for a refund.</li>
    <li> My sunscreen arrived promptly and in good shape.  The sunscreen is not sticky and easy to spread on my skin.  Should have purchased this a long time ago.</li>
    <li> Good quality, fast service, item is as described.</li>
    <li> This product is alright. It is not as moisturizing as I would like it to be. I have to use more to get enough moisture and as a result I go through it a lot faster. I like it enough to keep using it until I find something else I like better.</li>
    <li> The shipping was very fast but the product is terrible, very thin formula and smell different. I have been using Mary Kay day solution for years but this one is to greasy and sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I hope for refund.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item (Mary Kay Timewise SPF &#x27;25&#x27;)...they sent SPF &#x27;35&#x27;. I have used the &#x27;25&#x27; before and it works really well. It was a cross between a light lotion and sunscreen. This stuff that I got (the &#x27;35&#x27;) is like WATER!!! I am returning both bottles that I purchased today. I don&#x27;t know how they can get away with selling this! I mean, when you pump the top, it literally comes out like WHITE WATER. This is the most horrible item I have ever purchased!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic sunscreen!  I recently got to try a bunch of Mary Kay cosmetics and have been very pleased with all of them.  This is no exception.  It&#x27;s lightweight and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy which is one of my biggest complaints with most sunscreens.  While most of us don&#x27;t bother, you really should wear something like this anytime you&#x27;re going to be out in the sun.</li>
    <li> I am a PE teacher and always wanted something to protect my skin and keep it looking great, well this is it. I am using it for a year now too.</li>
    <li> I am out in the sun a lot and this is something I use every morning and often reapply after lunch. It works really well and I am very happy with it. Came packaged well and delivery was on time. Will return to purchase more Mary Kay!</li>
    <li> I love Mary Kay and have been using it for 30 years.  The prices are very good on Amazon.  I have gotten my products in a timely manner and in good condition.</li>
    <li> seems less creamy than when i&#x27;ve purchased it before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. One pump every morning and I know my skin is protected from the sun as well as getting the anti aging benefits to keep my skin looking healthier longer.</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  I love the way it smells and works on my face.  Thanks so much for sending it promptly and working with us.</li>
    <li> Great product - nice light moisturizier.  I blend it with my liquid makeup and put on together.  Works well.  I love the top pump.</li>
    <li> I love Mary Kay products because it is one of the few lines that my sensitive skin can handle.  This lotion is ultra-light, you wear it under your moisturizer.  I like it because it&#x27;s not heavy and greasy like many sunscreens, it doesn&#x27;t give you that super \\&quot;white\\&quot; look, either.  On top of that, some sunscreen products irritate my face, giving a burning sensation.  This product is very gentle.    The dispensing method is not a great fit for the product.  The sunscreen forms a little \\&quot;skin\\&quot; in the pump mechanism.  When you pump product it tends to break the skin and sort of explodes - shooting across the room or onto your clothing.  I would love to see a redesign of the dispenser, but until then I&#x27;ll just unscrew the cap and use it the old fashioned way.  Be careful, it&#x27;s less dense than normal sunscreen so it&#x27;s easy to accidentally spill.</li>
    <li> I was about to order this product until I read the reviews and saw that some people were getting SPF 35 instead of SPF 25. I decided to look at the writing on the bottle before purchasing and I see it has SPF 35 on it. The advertising is for SPF 25. What&#x27;s up with that? This is why it just got a one star rating from me. Please sell the right product.</li>
    <li> Though I ordered the 25, and received the 35, it turned out ok.  I had had 25 before and it was more of a lotion consistency.  The first time I got some 35 through a consultant, I returned it because it was so runny.  I received the 35 this time on this order and the consistency was not thick by any means but was not too runny as the first one had been.  I am satisfied.  I just looked back and saw that on this listing, the wording is for 25, and the picture actually shows 35... so what&#x27;s up with that?  Oh well, just ordered 35 for a cheaper price so I guess I&#x27;ll see what they send me this time...</li>
    <li> This works. I have trouble with most Sunscreen moisturizers burning my eyes even if I don&#x27;t get it near them.&lt;br /&gt;This one I can put on my eyelids and it doesn&#x27;t burn ever!</li>
    <li> This seemed to be more watery than ones I have had before.so will look for different vendor.</li>
    <li> After having skin cancer on my face 18 years ago, I use this product everyday, year round.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy feeling like some other products.  After ordering, I received the product in a timely manner.  I would defintely order again.</li>
    <li> Guys, don&#x27;t be afraid to use something like this.  I&#x27;ve stayed away from harsh after shave lotions and been using this a long time.  Excellent product but have to hide it from the wife or I might not get it back.  (75 years young and no face wrinkles.  :)  )</li>
    <li> this was a gift for my mother in law....she loved it and it got here super fast!  would buy again!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. Will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and it works great. I love it and would highly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I bought this item as a gift.  I bought this item as a gift.  I bought this item as a gift.</li>
    <li> I like how your skin feels with this the bottle is just so small</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and it was perfect and i remember it.. The liquid was thicker. My skin was supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However When I ordered thru amazon, it arrived as expected but the liquid was thinner and my face is not supple Now, I will order the same product directly thru Mary Kay and compare it.. See what happens.</li>
    <li> Think Mary Kay makes an excellent product.  Easy to apply and not greasy.  Lasts all day, only have to reapply it when I go in the pool.</li>
    <li> Lovely cream, I really like</li>
    <li> thanks to mary kay good product keep them coming but lower the price it quite expencive ok that all i want to say</li>
    <li> From crazzeto&#x27;s wife:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this at a Mary Kay party and when I tried it, it was painful and irritating to my skin and also had a thin, greasy consistency.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, and the price is right.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is light, thin, and goes on my face smoothly.  It isn&#x27;t greasy and the price is reasonable. Wow!</li>
    <li> This item was just ok. I actually like Garnia spot corrector alot less money. and it works good for age spots!</li>
    <li> HAVE NOT USED THESE PRODUCTS BEFORE I REAALY LIKED THEM SMELLED GOOD IF WAS SOFT AND NOT TO ROUGH RUB IN WELL</li>
    <li> I love the MK Time Wise products.  Everything that I use on my skin is Mary Kay, and the results are really good!</li>
    <li> Makes my face shiny and greesy and it burns my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Works great, Mary Kay is all I use and my consultant quit so it was easy to get it off of Amazon.</li>
    <li> The thing is that the product is been good for many years but the dealer shop that I bought they sent the wrong one I specified that I want the sp 25 and been three times sending me the sp 35 and this one cause irritation. ;(</li>
    <li> I love the Mary Kay Timewise line.  However, the Day Solution is nothing more than a fancy sunscreen.  I would never buy it on its own outside of the set.  I suppose that if you REALLY want to wear a sunscreen and don&#x27;t want to mix your skin products, you should do it, but I would rather wear a less expensive SPF.  Basically, you are paying for a very fancy bottle.  It is a very runny consistency, and it takes a few minutes to dry and soak in.  It is okay, but I won&#x27;t repurchase it.</li>
    <li> Some of the product was just at the expiration time.&lt;br /&gt;So I ended up giving out to other people so they don&#x27;t become useless to me.</li>
