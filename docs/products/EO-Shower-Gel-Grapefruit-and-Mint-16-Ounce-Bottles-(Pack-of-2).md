      <li>I use many of their products and I enjoy them all.  </li>

      <li>Great smell and does not dry out skin.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the quality of this product.</li>
      <li>Plus it is so refreshing and energizing you get out of the shower ready to start your day on the right foot!!</li>
      <li>But also, I think the EO shower gels in general are superior.</li>
      <li>It leaves you feeling clean and refreshed, but the scent doesn&#x27;t linger post-use (to me</li>

      <li>I plan to order several more</li>
      <li>makes my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>
      <li>It lathers very well and comes in a Plastic, dispenser bottle.  </li>
      <li>I could do with just a mint scent, I don&#x27;t really smell much of the Grapefruit anyway.</li>
      <li>Worth the price, plus it&#x27;s more natural than other products.</li>
      <li>The scent is not over powering yet true to a fresh cut grapefruit and crushed mint.</li>
      <li>This body wash smells fresh and clean without all the perfume scents that other body washes have.</li>
      <li>Plus they have cool blue packaging.  </li>
      <li>This shower gel doesn&#x27;t lather as much as some other body washes, but I haven&#x27;t found a more natural body wash that does.</li>
      <li>I cannot stand the smell of coconut and thought the smell would be overwhelming in the bathroom, but instead the strongest scent is mint with some slight grapefruit.</li>
      <li>They are made from high quality ingredients.  </li>
      <li>this is a plus, so you can go about your business, wear your normal scent, etc., without having competing smells).</li>
      <li>although subtle, quite refreshing first thing in the morning.</li>
      <li>It was just right for me with subtle scent and light tinglyness</li>
      <li>The scents are natural and not overpowering, and do NOT over-dry my skin.  </li>
      <li>Does not dry skin.</li>
      <li>I first tried this shower gel couple of months back when we were visiting my sister, I was hooked and found this on amazon , this shower gel is not too harsh or too creamy or too scented.</li>

    <li> I just got this EO shower gel/ grapefruit &amp; mint today from local store.    The scent is so good and it is not too foamy which I like it.    The reason I gave 4 stars is because the scent did not leave long after you rinsed it off.    Will try another products of EO soon.</li>
    <li> I am the fragrance freak of Buffalo. My nose wakes me up in the morning or knocks me out at night, depending on what it&#x27;s smelling. So when my DH broke out the first time he encountered a bottle of drugstore shower gel, I went looking for something more natural and I found it in this delicious Grapefruit and Mint formula. I just want to put this over ice and drink it, it smells that good! Plus Hubby isn&#x27;t breaking out anymore, which more than anything sold me on organic bath and beauty. The Grapefruit and Mint Shower Gel is my favorite one to take with me to the gym or pool, because it&#x27;s that refreshing after a good workout. PLEASE make a cologne of it!!! My nostrils will be indebted to you!</li>
    <li> Lovely grapefruit and mint scent. This shower gel doesn&#x27;t lather as much as some other body washes, but I haven&#x27;t found a more natural body wash that does. It leaves you feeling clean and refreshed, but the scent doesn&#x27;t linger post-use (to me this is a plus, so you can go about your business, wear your normal scent, etc., without having competing smells). The pump works well.</li>
    <li> This product has a great smell, mild tingle, washes off easily and is non drying.  What else do you need?</li>
    <li> Clean and refreshing. Love EO products</li>
    <li> good quality&lt;br /&gt;great scent&lt;br /&gt;high end product&lt;br /&gt;good foam&lt;br /&gt;good packaging plenty of it!&lt;br /&gt;great for guests and personal bathroom</li>
    <li> I love the freshness of this product.  It feels good to wash with something that smells so good and fresh.  EO products are wonderful.  They are made from high quality ingredients.  You will love this shower gel!</li>
    <li> Love this product, plan on ordering more</li>
    <li> I could do with just a mint scent, I don&#x27;t really smell much of the Grapefruit anyway. But it leaves me nice and soft and lathers well.</li>

    <li> Grapefruit and mint is one of my favorite EO scents.  It&#x27;s brisk and refreshing.  EO uses quality essential oils (hence the name, EO).  Plus they have cool blue packaging.  I use many of their products and I enjoy them all.  Try some.</li>
    <li> So far, I love this gel.  The scent is quite pronounced and smells like grapefruit.  It dissipates quickly after you rinse it off.  It lathers very well and comes in a Plastic, dispenser bottle.  Love it!!!  I used it on my face because I can usually tell this way how drying---or non-drying it is and I would rate this a 9 for non-drying.  I will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a few all natural soaps before I landed on this EO Shower Gel. It smells great and produces a nice lather. I love it. My skin likes it too.  Some soaps irritate my skin but this one has not caused any issues, which is great. I would definitely recommend this soap.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the quality of this product.</li>
    <li> Smells &amp; feels great!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite (existing, they discontinued the Jasmin, damn them!) EO smells EVER. I love the EO shower gels and this smell is so good that I gave this one at Christmas and everyone I gave it to took a whiff at the bottle and their eyes lit up.  THIS STUFF SMELLS GOOOOOOOOOOD!!  But also, I think the EO shower gels in general are superior. They have good lather which doesn&#x27;t take a ridiculous amount of the product to create and the gels are a good pH. They are very good for sensitive skin, too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m SUPER picky about soaps for myself, and my kids. I use only those that lack harsh sulfates &amp; other chemicals, and EO fits the bill.  The scents are natural and not overpowering, and do NOT over-dry my skin.  I use this on myself and my kids and I do not get dried out at all.  The gel goes a long way, so while it&#x27;s a little pricey, you get what you pay for, and this lasts a long time.  Well, well worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product. Have looked for it for over a year and finally found it. I plan to order several more so I won&#x27;t be left without it again. Its great on eczema.The essential oil fragrance is refreshing. This body wash smells fresh and clean without all the perfume scents that other body washes have. Plus it is so refreshing and energizing you get out of the shower ready to start your day on the right foot!!</li>
    <li> Smells great, nice and tingly makes my skin soft and smooth.  Love this product, would highly recommend to anyone in the market for a great body soap.</li>
    <li> a very pleasant fragrance although subtle, quite refreshing first thing in the morning. something i will buy again for sure.</li>
    <li> Smells SO good. Lasts a long time. Good value for the price.</li>
    <li> Good bye soap! I have been purchasing these for about a year now and I still love this gel! It&#x27;s refreshing ( I buy the grapefruit &amp; mint) and feels great!</li>
    <li> This shower gel provides a wonderful way to wake up in the morning. The scent is not over powering yet true to a fresh cut grapefruit and crushed mint. Have never tried a EO product I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> This Gel is the GREATEST!!!  I love the sent and it makes a shower feel like I&#x27;m in a tropical place...&lt;br /&gt;being in Minn. ....cold winters Ha....I have tried others but nothing compares to this ....&lt;br /&gt;dsz</li>
    <li> Great smell and does not dry out skin. Switched from Nivea Mens shower gel to EO in my gym bag.</li>
    <li> This stuff wakes you up in the morning!  The bottle pumps well, but could be bigger. The wash itself works fine but I would like it if they made a 32 oz bottle!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband because he has very dry skin. I was looking for something that would help with his back especially as he has back scratchers everywhere &#x27;just in case&#x27; and believe me, he uses them a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was recommended to me because of the coconut oil it contains. I cannot stand the smell of coconut and thought the smell would be overwhelming in the bathroom, but instead the strongest scent is mint with some slight grapefruit. Not only does it help to wake me up, but it has helped my husband&#x27;s dry skin immensely.</li>
    <li> Refreshing stuff. Smells wonderful. Does not dry skin. I will be buying this again. Very happy with this great product.</li>
    <li> I discovered these products while on vacation and had to order them when I got home. The grapefruit gel and lotion smell fantastically fresh and citrusy. Worth the price, plus it&#x27;s more natural than other products. Love it!</li>
