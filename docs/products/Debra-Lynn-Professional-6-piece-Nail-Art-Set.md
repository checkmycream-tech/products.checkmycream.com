      <li>I was happy when I received my package in the mail and when I opened it</li>
      <li>The quality is good.  </li>
      <li>However, the state they were in did not make a good impression.</li>
      <li>I followed the guidelines and was just honest.</li>
      <li>Thanks for a great product at a great price.</li>
      <li>Honestly the product didnt come as pictured.</li>
      <li>Came quickly and product is of great quality.</li>
      <li>I love that it has everything I need for painting my nails and decorating them.  </li>
      <li>More travel size.</li>
      <li>so i was pleased with my purchase.</li>
      <li>I love that it has everything I need for painting my nails and decorating them.</li>
      <li>The fan brush is awesome, but this set doesn&#x27;t actually come with the angled brush.</li>
      <li>I use em but could had been better.</li>
      <li>and they are more like mini brushes.</li>
      <li>I have had to trim some longer hairs off of the brushes but considering the price the set is pretty good.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this set, so cheap</li>
      <li>After reading the first review, I was expecting clean, good conditioned brushes.</li>
      <li>but once i put product on it, it worked fine.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re wanting to play around or have a starter kit invest a few more bucks in a better quality set!!</li>
      <li>The items appear to be brand new, and the brushes are okay quality.</li>
      <li>The bristles of 3 of my brushes bent out of place and one of them even had some kind of paint or something left on the silver band.</li>
      <li>yet you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>The over all quality of the brushes aren&#x27;t good, which is expected.</li>
      <li>I ordered new ones, but the condition they were in could easily be mistaken as used.</li>
      <li>My first review was denied, don&#x27;t know why.</li>
      <li>alongside this, The brushes were ok and the packaging came in a huge bubble package for something so small.</li>
      <li>These work really well.  </li>
      <li>Brushes with protective caps had really messed up bristles.</li>
      <li>I have purchased pieces seperately and one of the brushes cost as much as all of these together.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t cost much</li>
      <li>the \\&quot;professional nail set\\&quot; was much smaller than I had exspected them to be, I would have hoped to get the items pictured but they were not all true to details provided, which is cool</li>
      <li>I was ever so excited to have bought this item, that was until I actually got the package and opened it...</li>
      <li>I would have been better off buying more expensive tools.</li>
      <li>Only thing i would like to see is the fine detail brush would be better made, the bristles are all spread out and hard to use.</li>
      <li>That is the only useful, okay-quality tool that I received in my shipment.</li>
      <li>All the items look new but the package they are in was ripped on the side and this is a gift for someone this year.   </li>
      <li>The only beef I have, and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is that the so-called angled brush (in the picture) is not actually angled at all in the kit I received; it was straight.</li>

<li> I ordered this set, and although it did come on time the set is smaller than expected.</li>
<li> so I&#x27;m not really upset, but still.</li>
<li> It was missing the angle brush and seemed smaller than i expeted.</li>
<li> I also was missing the bent brush, and the fan brush was only half as wide as the one in this picture.</li>
<li> there is no slanted brush as other users stated.</li>
<li> please save ur money these are not worth a postage stamp muchless anything else.</li>
<li> I feel like this was not worth my money.</li>
<li> but I did not expect them to be such poor quality.</li>
<li> I ordered this product and recived it about a month ago as the reviews above state the brushed are very small, to the point where they can be held by a shotglass, and some of the brushes bristles are damaged or in poor condition to be called new, very disappointing.</li>
<li> I did not realize the brushes were going to be so small.</li>
<li> The package I got had the dotting tool, the fan brush and another small brush.</li>
<li> These brushes are very small, the picture doesn&#x27;t represent what you get at all.</li>
<li> I just recieved my set today, but I was extremely disappointed when I found only 3pieces instead of 6.</li>
<li> They are very hard to use because of this.</li>
<li> I ordered these brushes and am not happy with them.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am happy i got the items but I did not receive the brush with is bent shown in the pictured, disappointed. i did get the majority all six brushes. I figured they must have ran out of the bent brush.</li>
    <li> These work really well.  The quality is good.  The brushes dont shed or anything like that.</li>
    <li> This item is perfect for my hobby of toe nail art. I have purchased pieces seperately and one of the brushes cost as much as all of these together. Thanks for a great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> I ordered this set, and although it did come on time the set is smaller than expected. More travel size. there is no slanted brush as other users stated. The items appear to be brand new, and the brushes are okay quality. Like my title says, you get what you pay for. Its only 8.99 what can you expect?</li>
    <li> Honestly the product didnt come as pictured. It was missing the angle brush and seemed smaller than i expeted. alongside this, The brushes were ok and the packaging came in a huge bubble package for something so small. I use em but could had been better.</li>
    <li> What I was sent was not what I thought I was going to get. I did not recieve the same brushes shown in the photo. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and recived it about a month ago as the reviews above state the brushed are very small, to the point where they can be held by a shotglass, and some of the brushes bristles are damaged or in poor condition to be called new, very disappointing.</li>
    <li> After reading the first review, I was expecting clean, good conditioned brushes. However, the state they were in did not make a good impression. The bristles of 3 of my brushes bent out of place and one of them even had some kind of paint or something left on the silver band. I ordered new ones, but the condition they were in could easily be mistaken as used.</li>
    <li> The fan brush is awesome, but this set doesn&#x27;t actually come with the angled brush. My striper was kinda frayed but once i put product on it, it worked fine. I have had to trim some longer hairs off of the brushes but considering the price the set is pretty good.</li>
    <li> I was just starting on my nail art and though this brush set would do, but I can&#x27;t get it to do what I want it to do and they are more like mini brushes. So disappointed.</li>
    <li> This nail art kit contains 5 brushes and one dotting tool.  I love that it has everything I need for painting my nails and decorating them.  The only beef I have, and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is that the so-called angled brush (in the picture) is not actually angled at all in the kit I received; it was straight.  One of the reasons I chose this kit was for that angled brush, so I was disappointed it was not as pictured.</li>
    <li> Sorry this is the worst idem I&#x27;ve ever purchased off here a waste of money please save ur money these are not worth a postage stamp muchless anything else.</li>
    <li> This 6 piece nail art set i anything but \\&quot;professional\\&quot;. I was happy when I received my package in the mail and when I opened it I thought this is not what I ordered. I did not realize the brushes were going to be so small. I feel like this was not worth my money. The brushes may get the job done but I did not expect them to be such poor quality.</li>
    <li> My first review was denied, don&#x27;t know why. I followed the guidelines and was just honest. Do not purchase this item if you expect to get the angled brush, you won&#x27;t get it. The seller scammed me out of the shipping costs when I asked for a refund. The over all quality of the brushes aren&#x27;t good, which is expected.</li>
    <li> I was ever so excited to have bought this item, that was until I actually got the package and opened it...the \\&quot;professional nail set\\&quot; was much smaller than I had exspected them to be, I would have hoped to get the items pictured but they were not all true to details provided, which is cool I guess for the price I paid what did I exspect??</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes and am not happy with them.  They are plastic and bend and flex when you use them.  They are very hard to use because of this.</li>
    <li> All the items look new but the package they are in was ripped on the side and this is a gift for someone this year.   I hope she enjoys it</li>
    <li> I just recieved my set today, but I was extremely disappointed when I found only 3pieces instead of 6. The package I got had the dotting tool, the fan brush and another small brush. The package says 6 pc. These are not at all like what is pictured!</li>
    <li> These brushes are very small, the picture doesn&#x27;t represent what you get at all. Brushes with protective caps had really messed up bristles. I also was missing the bent brush, and the fan brush was only half as wide as the one in this picture. If you&#x27;re wanting to play around or have a starter kit invest a few more bucks in a better quality set!!</li>
    <li> This nail art kit contains 5 brushes and one dotting tool. I love that it has everything I need for painting my nails and decorating them.

One of the reasons I chose this kit was for that angled brush, so I was disappointed it was not as pictured.</li>
    <li> I only use the dotting tool. That is the only useful, okay-quality tool that I received in my shipment. It didn&#x27;t cost much so I&#x27;m not really upset, but still. I would have been better off buying more expensive tools.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this set, so cheap yet you get your money&#x27;s worth. Only thing i would like to see is the fine detail brush would be better made, the bristles are all spread out and hard to use. But i bought the set for the dotter tool and the fan brush so i was pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas present. Came quickly and product is of great quality. Would definitely recommend the product for anyone else.</li>
