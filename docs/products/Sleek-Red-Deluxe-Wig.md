      <li>The wig was light and breaths well while dancing all night.  </li>
      <li>I want to suggest a great product - \\&quot;Flirty Red Wig\\&quot; from Wonder Costumers.  </li>

      <li>My absolute favorite wig while it lasted :)&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
      <li>Am excited to wear at upcoming party.</li>
      <li>I want a  bright red wig like Tiffany,the singers hair color.</li>
      <li>The top of the wig is really matted and knotty.</li>
      <li>(About like three full wefts of hair extensions.)</li>
      <li>True to picture color</li>
      <li>A good choice if you want red hair like that paramour chick.</li>
      <li>Most people thought it was my real hair.</li>
      <li>Overall very pleased.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly, this wig looks almost exactly as it does in the website picture, including having the same color!  </li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a little upset because I read the reviews on here and the reviews were great....</li>
      <li>It was packaged nicely, but the fibers are very coarse and not sleek at all.  </li>
      <li>ok for Holloween although my 13 year old daughter woukd not wear it.  </li>
      <li>although the item came very fast, item was frizzy on the top and had kinks from the packaging when using a very low heat irn to straighten the item out it melted, did not end up wearing item fro halloweeen</li>
      <li>Lil more orange than red like pic.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for when I have short hair and miss long hair temporarily.</li>
      <li>Even after the brushing its really gross at the top by the seam.</li>
      <li>Planing to use it for AniMineapolis if our Cross can go to that:)</li>
      <li>Ok, I gave this wig 1 star because it was an actual wig.  </li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t exactly like photo.</li>
      <li>First of all, there is literally no hair on the cap....</li>
      <li>First time I have encountered that.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Its also not as nice as some other wigs I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
      <li>i have pretty much treated it like real hair, and now its finally looking better.</li>
      <li>it is full so full you would think would a short one cause they dont shed as much...</li>
      <li>I gave it a second star because it is some kind of red (though more orange than red).  </li>
      <li>got the package yesterday and was super excited about my costume shopping finally being complete.  </li>
      <li>The red does not look cheap and it is very chic and hip looking.  </li>
      <li>Received and it was better quality than expected.</li>
      <li>Not to mention I didn&#x27;t really need to style it that much.</li>
      <li>Heavier than real hair but looks real.</li>
      <li>The wig isn&#x27;t straight or shiny like on the model seen here at all.</li>
      <li>thank you so much</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is quite straight, not fuzzed up, bent or crumpled.  </li>
      <li>Got here really fast.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just not as red red as i would&#x27;ve liked.</li>
      <li>It had a hump on top that would not go down</li>
      <li>the longer you let them soak the more natureal they will look and if your wefts are shedding put stitch glue under the cap only on the edge of the inner wefts.  </li>
      <li>Looks like the picture except for the top where the hair splits it looks like a tangle or like it kinda melted a little.</li>
      <li>when i received this the top had a HUGE knot in it that was impossible to brush out and left the top all knarley.</li>
      <li>The front of the wig is stiff and the potentially cute bangs are hideous.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised to see it rated as high as it is.</li>
      <li>A lot of people thought it was my natural hair!</li>
      <li>First i brushed, then straightened, used a anti-frizz serum and hairspray.</li>
      <li>Luckily, the same thing happened to me last year, so I ordered a backup wig.</li>
      <li>so i&#x27;m used to actually having to adjust the cap because they are too large.  </li>
      <li>WHERE NEAR the picture.  </li>
      <li>Everyone thinks it is my real hair - although it is a sort of \\&quot;punk\\&quot; red color, some people think it is just dyed hair - not a wig.  </li>
      <li>selves do not waste your money</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The wig I received was black, not red. I needed a red wig for Halloween. Luckily, the same thing happened to me last year, so I ordered a backup wig. Will be returning this. I did feel like it deserved at least one star since it is the actual style of wig I ordered (unlike last year, which was both the wrong color and style). Anyways, unacceptable, especially since &amp;#34;Red&amp;#34; is in the product title.</li>
    <li> Only complaint I have about this wig is that it wasn&#x27;t easy to style but otherwise it fit my chucky costume to a T.</li>
    <li> I read so many bad reviews for this wig - I want to suggest a great product - \\&quot;Flirty Red Wig\\&quot; from Wonder Costumers.  I think it is in the $15 range.  The only problem is shipping is expensive - around $8 - so I always order 4 or 5 wigs at a time.  For a low priced wig it holds up quite well.  I get constant positive comments every single day I wear it.  Everyone thinks it is my real hair - although it is a sort of \\&quot;punk\\&quot; red color, some people think it is just dyed hair - not a wig.  If I didn&#x27;t tell people I was wearing a wig, they wouldn&#x27;t figure it out!  The red does not look cheap and it is very chic and hip looking.  It takes 20 years off my age when I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be a Glamazon on Amazon with \\&quot;Flirty Red Wig\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> ok for Holloween although my 13 year old daughter woukd not wear it.  It had a hump on top that would not go down</li>
    <li> I loved this wig! I used it as part of my Mary Jane Watson costume (Spiderman&#x27;s girlfriend) since my fiance was Spiderman. It looked great and I felt sexy!</li>
    <li> I just got the wig it perfect love the color it a little longer then what it look on the picture but for the price I cant complaint tottally recommend</li>
    <li> I like long length of this red wig but how can i say that i can never find a wig that&#x27;s as red as the photo advertises? I want a  bright red wig like Tiffany,the singers hair color.Where oh where can i find one? Other than that,the wig is a great length and has nice bangs.It&#x27;s just not as red red as i would&#x27;ve liked.A good choice if you want red hair like that paramour chick. At least that&#x27;s what the wig ad says.If this be the color of your choice then,wig out!</li>
    <li> I was a hit at our costume party.  The wig was light and breaths well while dancing all night.  It is exactly what I expected for the price I paid.  This is not a wig that you would use to look real, but is perfect what when you need to pull off a special look.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t exactly like photo. I got what I paid for. It&#x27;s not horrible. It&#x27;s an okay starter wig.</li>
    <li> Perfect! I will say that I did have to style this a little bit. I even had to bust out the hair straightner, but this did make my costume a huge hit! Everyone loved it! It was perfect for the money! Perfect match for the \\&quot;Sexy Chucky\\&quot; Halloween costume! Absolutely perfect for Halloween!</li>
    <li> This was not what I expected, but it worked. I didn&#x27;t like the fact that it did not look like the picture on the package or online.</li>
    <li> Very nice wig, considering the price. It has soft natural looking hair fibers. I bought this wig for a Marian Cross (D. Gray Man) cosplay for a friend. I wish it was a bit brighter red, however that&#x27;s not the seller&#x27;s fault as it shows in the picture it&#x27;s a brown-ish red. Very nice wig, good amount of hair, covers the wig. Not cheap looking at all. It is durable and comfortable (I tried it on before my friend did o.0) . Not to mention I didn&#x27;t really need to style it that much. Planing to use it for AniMineapolis if our Cross can go to that:)</li>
    <li> It was really ugly did not look nothing like the picture .... It not use to me i don&#x27;t plan on wearing for holloween</li>
    <li> Looks and feels great!</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite wig while it lasted :)&lt;br /&gt;Fast arrival!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this.....it had a huge spot in the front like a rats nest.....I spent hours trying to make it wearable....nothing like the model pic..... I added a hat to cover up the spot ... Do not recommend</li>
    <li> Pros: Surprisingly, this wig looks almost exactly as it does in the website picture, including having the same color!  First time I have encountered that.&lt;br /&gt;It is quite straight, not fuzzed up, bent or crumpled.  I just had to shake it out for a second before putting it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: the cap is a bit small.  Someone like me, who has long hair, has a tough time fitting it all in without pinning it to the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;It is a tad thin, but quite acceptable.  (About like three full wefts of hair extensions.)</li>
    <li> entertaining wig. Fits a little small but not bad. I expect to have to fiddle a little to find where to sit a wig. I start by cutting of the fitting straps, they just make me uncomfortable. I expect a wig to each fit a little different and require proper care. Picture is close so know what you are getting, you have to comb it carefully and take care of it to prevent the wig cap from showing but it is a good buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for my Halloween costume, not thinking that it would be spectacular for $15.  I read the reviews for this product and thought that I would just get it for Halloween and not worry about it.  I am going to be Chucky (the female Chucky) for Halloween and even though some of the reviews were saying that the color of the wig were definitely NOT aunurn or burgandy, it didn&#x27;t matter to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the package yesterday and was super excited about my costume shopping finally being complete.  The front of the wig is stiff and the potentially cute bangs are hideous.  The wig itself is orange, which is okay because Chucky&#x27;s hair is red.  That&#x27;s one issue I could see.  And as soon as I took it out of the plastic, it was shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, I believe that I will be Chucky for Halloween with a Snooki bump in the front to make my costume kind of work.  2 stars for this being $15 and as for the wig itself, 1 thumb up and 1 thumb down.  For a one time use this is the best, if you are expecting what you see in the picture, then you will be in for a surprise!</li>
    <li> True to picture color but that&#x27;s about where the similarities end. The wig isn&#x27;t straight or shiny like on the model seen here at all. It looks really dried out, and poofy. It was folded up so there are dents up and down the whole thing which really isn&#x27;t an issue since one person said they took a flat iron to it; (this is a HUGE problem as this wig looks like the biggest rats nest, I pulled out the flat iron and it singed off a part of the wig after BARELY being touched by it. I didn&#x27;t think it was possible to make this wig look any worse; I stand corrected). The top of the wig is really matted and knotty. I just spent about 15 minutes trying to brush it out without pulling all the hairs out. Even after the brushing its really gross at the top by the seam. I&#x27;m not sure how they got the side part as shown on this model either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this to wear with the Sexy Chucky costume and it&#x27;s horrendous. I&#x27;m actually embarrassed to put this on and leave the house, even for Halloween! I feel like I had the coolest costume and it was ruined by the hair.</li>
    <li> Received and it was better quality than expected. Got it out of package and ran a wide tooth comb through it for styling, didn&#x27;t yank or tangle. Heavier than real hair but looks real. Am excited to wear at upcoming party.</li>
    <li> Does not look like the picture. Wig is folded so it has creases in the hair. Bangs of wig will not stay as styled in the picture. Guess its alright for halloween but I was disappointed in the quality and overall styling.</li>
    <li> This product does need alot of work. i have pretty much treated it like real hair, and now its finally looking better. First i brushed, then straightened, used a anti-frizz serum and hairspray.</li>
    <li> After much straightening, brushing, and pinning; it looked great. Most people thought it was my real hair. I let them believe it.</li>
    <li> Over all I give this wig 4 stars cuz it is good quality for the price and the color is as shown but the bangs are very stiff and hard to get to stay in place.</li>
    <li> This wig came in looking great but has become a rats nest rather quickly.  Now it is a frizzy mess.</li>
    <li> For a halloween wig it will serve its purpose. Got here really fast. Lil more orange than red like pic. which is perfect cause its chuckys hair color</li>
    <li> Ok, I gave this wig 1 star because it was an actual wig.  I gave it a second star because it is some kind of red (though more orange than red).  I&#x27;m a little upset because I read the reviews on here and the reviews were great....I on the other hand must either have gotten one bad wig or they may have changed their product.  First of all, there is literally no hair on the cap....there are about 100 strands and you can actually see through the entire thing when you have it on.  Second, the cap is a bit small.  My head is on the small side so i&#x27;m used to actually having to adjust the cap because they are too large.  This cap would hardly go on.  Third, the color is ORANGE...not red.  Though it&#x27;s a red orange, the picture is definitely not what i got.  I was expecting it not to be that great looking but what i got was NO WHERE NEAR the picture.  So, although i think that the previous reviews may have been great, I believe that the company changed their product or i may have gotten unlucky and purchased a bad wig out of their batch.  Either way, i honestly can&#x27;t use it and I&#x27;m sending it back.  Cannot even use it for anything else because there is no hair in it....  I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> when i received this the top had a HUGE knot in it that was impossible to brush out and left the top all knarley.</li>
    <li> This wig was great for the price! Not too shiny and wig hairs fully covered the netting. Bangs were more frontal and swoopy then short and edgy like the picture but nothing a little styling can&#x27;t fix. Color is more of a copper tone. Overall very pleased. Ordered this on a Friday night and I received it on a Wednesday in very nice packaging!</li>
    <li> although the item came very fast, item was frizzy on the top and had kinks from the packaging when using a very low heat irn to straighten the item out it melted, did not end up wearing item fro halloweeen</li>
    <li> This is an amazing hair it is full so full you would think would a short one cause they dont shed as much...When I opend the pacage the color was a nice wine auburn which is what my moms was when she was a kid. I dont ever use a wig comb keep those away from any wig  (15 years of figuring this out.) pour cold water and ice into a bucket enough to cover the wig completely.&lt;br /&gt;now before adding the wig gently using a pick comb. start combing make sure the under side is commb..I then put into it baby shampoo and salon selective as a conditioner.  the longer you let them soak the more natureal they will look and if your wefts are shedding put stitch glue under the cap only on the edge of the inner wefts.  put the wig into cold water and kinda of do a folding thing lower in bend it lower it bend it and that should keep it fine..do not commb wet ever..it will shed like a bull dog. hang them dripping wet after rinsing inside of cap and all the hair now shake it forward then back hang her up wait till over night and discover the miracle at hand,..now if the wigg is totally gone buy some wefts and sew em in if you look you can see how it is done easy...........&lt;br /&gt;love dawn</li>
    <li> Looks like the picture except for the top where the hair splits it looks like a tangle or like it kinda melted a little. Going to have to do something to try and cover that part :(</li>
    <li> theis was the perfect length and color. this is one of my favorite ones that i ordered here on amazon. thank you so much</li>
    <li> cheap quality you look like your a crack head who cant take care of them selves do not waste your money</li>
    <li> When I purchased this wig for a costume the material felt the hair was waxed. Its also not as nice as some other wigs I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
    <li> it was ratted and ugly. returned for another wig for poison ivy costume.</li>
    <li> The wig we received doesn&#x27;t look nothing like the one the model, hers looks like her natural hair.</li>
    <li> Looks good in photos but not in person. Fits poorly unless you have a really smaller head. Color is the same.</li>
    <li> Looks great! A lot of people thought it was my natural hair! I&#x27;ve worn it several times now. Thanks!! Great seller!</li>
    <li> I ordered this since it got pretty good reviews.  The color and style are like the photo shown, however the wig itself is a poor quality costume wig.  It was packaged nicely, but the fibers are very coarse and not sleek at all.  I&#x27;m surprised to see it rated as high as it is.</li>
    <li> I feel sexy when I wear this. It&#x27;s great for when I have short hair and miss long hair temporarily.</li>
    <li> Fit to small. It kept taking of my daughter&#x27;s head on Halloween</li>
    <li> its beaufuil in the picture but when you buy it and receive it it&#x27;s a mess  sorry I&#x27;m giving a bad review</li>
