      <li>Love this thing!</li>
      <li>This is amazing machine, I used before.</li>
      <li>This is an amazing product and nicely thoughtout.</li>
      <li>I cut my own hair once a week as I have been doing so for over 7+ yrs now..</li>
      <li>This strategy has worked for me for 10 years and no one has ever suspected that I cut my own hair.  </li>
      <li>If you cut your own hair</li>
      <li>are the steps I use to cut my own hair.  </li>
      <li>It is by far the best trimmer out there.</li>
      <li>It worked great and clean up was easy.  </li>
      <li>I had my original HKVAC2000 since 2004 and was VERY happy to see a new one on the market.</li>
      <li>Overall, it is great!</li>
      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>I love this vacuuming set.</li>
      <li>rather they skipped the scissors and combs, and put more quality into the tool itself.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have a toddler who literally we have had to hold still to cut his hair because he HATES it touching him.</li>
      <li>What a fantastic product!</li>
      <li>In conclusion, I can&#x27;t recommend this trimmer/clipper enough and would say order one and try it out and see why I am so giddy and happy about this product!</li>
      <li>I bought 4 more just in case</li>
      <li>and I might not be able to replace it.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>It is probably more like 70%.  </li>
      <li>Great product, leaves very lite to no cleanup</li>
      <li>I then use the 1&amp;#34; on top</li>
      <li>I bought 2 of them :-).</li>
      <li>and then I use the 3/4&amp;#34; to blend in the top with the sides.  </li>
      <li>The chamber that holds the hair has much more space than you would think from looking at it.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so glad that it was re-issued.</li>
      <li>There are many options for hair length to chose and you can swap them out all the time.</li>
      <li>Gives a close cut, and cleans up most of the hair it removes.  </li>
      <li>, I have one ten year ago still working perfect</li>
      <li>The vacuum part of it is great!</li>
      <li>It vacuums most of the hair and is easy to maintain.</li>
      <li>Like so many others, we were so happy to see this item come back.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t pull hair and the attachments are easy to get on and off.</li>
      <li>new one is even better; more vacuum+sharpness!</li>
      <li>Works fine.</li>
      <li>the plug isn&#x27;t ginormous like the previous one (awesome!)</li>
      <li>it is running fine.</li>
      <li>this unit wasn&#x27;t available.</li>
      <li>Then this one became available,  He likes it because it vacuums the hair.</li>
      <li>Happy to see Remington bring back this product.</li>
      <li>They still do fit comfortably in my hands though.</li>
      <li>It trims off hair smoothly.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic product.  </li>
      <li>This is the greatest thing since the wheel, thank you so much Remington for bringing it back!</li>
      <li>So Far, So Good.</li>
      <li>THANKS Remington for bringing this awesome product back!!</li>
      <li>It is good to have a hand mirror to make sure that you didn&#x27;t miss any patches in the back.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Exactly what I needed, Pays for itself, Thanks.</li>
    <li> The product was a replacement for an older one.  I was satisfied with the older model and the replacement.  Delivery was on time, as stated.  No problems.</li>
    <li> Finally they brought this back. It is by far the best trimmer out there.</li>
    <li> This vacuum shaver collects about 95% of the hair, I have 3 little boys that need hair trimming every few months and they did not like getting there hair cut because the hair went all over the place, now they do not mind at all.  A great product!</li>
    <li> The first one we purchased lasted nearly 7 years! This is the perfect tool for keeping your head shaved and not leaving a mess! This cuts very close to the head and can be used as a regular hair cutting razor as well.</li>
    <li> I was elated when Remington decided to bring back the HKVAC2000.  I had the original version HKVAC2000 that I have been using since 2009 and I was concerned that it may stop working at some point and I might not be able to replace it.  The new HKVAC2000A is pretty much identical to its predecessor, except for the color of the unit is black instead of gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the steps I use to cut my own hair.  You want to use more than one guard length unless you are cutting your hair really short like a crew cut.  I usually do my sides first with the 1/2 inch.  I then use the 1&amp;#34; on top and then I use the 3/4&amp;#34; to blend in the top with the sides.  It is good to have a hand mirror to make sure that you didn&#x27;t miss any patches in the back.  lol  Also, if you want your hair longer than 1&amp;#34;, then you can gain an extra 1/4&amp;#34; by not snapping the guard all the way in place.  This strategy has worked for me for 10 years and no one has ever suspected that I cut my own hair.  The vacuum works great.  It doesn&#x27;t work so great if you try and use it as a trimmer on your beard.  Stubble doesn&#x27;t vacuum up as well.  But, then again, it wasn&#x27;t designed for that.</li>
    <li> I have only used it once so far.  It worked great and clean up was easy.  Don&#x27;t know how it will hold up long term but this is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Junk. Got 2 uses out of it and it died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the older version and it worked beautifully for many years. Had such high hopes for this device. They should look into their quality control.</li>
    <li> I had the previous version for over 10 years and it still works, I am getting this one and will keep the other as a backup. I love the vacuum feature, it eliminates most of the mess. 98% of it at least,</li>
    <li> Works well. A slightly stronger vacuum would make it a  5 star.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very practical to use - I hate in messing up my bathroom sink bec it clogs the drainage. With the vacuum attachment, it easy for me to cut my hair weekly - with a std 1/2&amp;#34; guard.  Very happy - I saved at least $50 each month - now I can cut it once a week, it could be a savings of $100.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I bought it as a gift for someone who had one previously for 11 years and it broke. He made it clear that he wanted the exact same product because of its design, what it comes with, how it prevents the hair from going everywhere (vaccum) and the way it cuts his hair. He is very satisfied with this product. Definitely a great buy.</li>
    <li> My Husband loves it especially the vacuum part!</li>
    <li> Was waiting years for this to be back for sale!&lt;br /&gt;Luved my first one bought 10 yrs ago; was crossing my fingers it didn&#x27;t conk out.&lt;br /&gt;This new one is even better; more vacuum+sharpness!</li>
    <li> Absolute fantastic clipper.</li>
    <li> This is my second one in about 9 year</li>
    <li> One of the best electical items I ever bought.</li>
    <li> Better then expected, works extremely well.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  They did not make it for a few years.  Do not know why.  Glad it is back on the market.  Thank you Remington.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set of clippers to replace an old Wahl clipper set.  I love the vacuum  in this clipper.  My wife does not yell when I cut my hair now.  The clippers cut smoothly and leave very little mess.  I love them.</li>
    <li> Very useful no mess when u cut the hair</li>
    <li> Love this! My husband uses this all of the time and loves the vacuum feature.</li>
    <li> Cuts hair with ease and the vacuum is quite strong.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my balding head that I buzz about every five days. It vacuums most of the hair and is easy to maintain.I had the previous model and it lasted seven years before needing replacing. I expect this one will last at least as long.</li>
    <li> I use these trimmers to clip my dog&#x27;s hair and they are perfect.  No fly away hair and my pomeranian-chihuahua has a lot of hair.  It is a great and efficient gadget,</li>
    <li> My husband loves this.  He needed to replace one that wore out and couldn&#x27;t find one anywhere for two or three years.  Then this one became available,  He likes it because it vacuums the hair.</li>
    <li> Had one and got this to replace what I gave away</li>
    <li> This product has saved me hundreds of dollars on haircuts, and lots of cleanup time. I cut my own hair, and this clipper does a great job of collecting the hair as it cuts. I owned the previous model of this product, and it lasted for more than 10 years of weekly haircuts. I definitely recommend this one!</li>
    <li> I been looking for one of these for a while. I bought one 10 years ago and it still works but the blades are getting dull. This is the best invention since sliced bread.....</li>
    <li> Had the original for who knows how many years, always afraid that it may fail and I will be left without a great vacuum haircut kit.  After years of searching and waiting, finally Remington brought it back.  This is the best, forget all those clippers that drop your hair everywhere. You are not at a salon where someone will be sweeping after you.</li>
    <li> It definitely vacuums some hair, but don&#x27;t expect it to be anywhere near 100%.  It is probably more like 70%.  I guess my hopes were too high for this.  2 stars because they claim there is no cleanup.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product.  I use it to cut my husband&#x27;s hair, and hair is vacuumed into the container.  This is probably the 4th one I have owned.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This razor is great. The vacuum is a necessity and I&#x27;m so glad that it was re-issued.</li>
    <li> Makes cutting hair easy and catches most if not all of the hair that has been cut.</li>
    <li> Now that I cam cutting my husband&#x27;s hair, we are saving quite a bit of money.  Took a little practice but he now&lt;br /&gt;loves the result and I love the vacuum sucking up the hair. Very smart!</li>
    <li> Love it. Last time i looked online for these they didnt have them.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Nice not having to clean up a mess afterwords.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for around five years now, and this are far and away the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever used. Lightweight, not too noisy, and I love the vacuum feature.</li>
    <li> this is the second time that I buy this product in amazon the first time was 7 years ago and I very agree with it, I Have ti replace because I loos the another one but this product is exelent,</li>
    <li> I have had the old one for about 9 years still works.I have tried tofind a new one for several years so glad they put it back on the market.I used it to shave my beard I like how close it cuts.</li>
    <li> My wife trims on my hair. Don&#x27;t have to cover up with a towel to hopefully catch the hair. This thing cuts great and sucks the clippings right up.</li>
    <li> This is our second one and we love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product...works exactly as advertised...had the model before this since 2004 and it still works</li>
    <li> Owned the original for 10 years before the wall plug crapped out and broke. It was the &amp;#34;BEST&amp;#34; hair trimmer I ever owned and I was pretty upset and disappointed when it broke! Afterwards, I bought 10 other trimmers ranging from $25 to $100 trying to find one that cut as close and clean as the Remington one did and came up 0 for 10! I wasted a TON of $$ and have a TON of knicks and micro cuts on my head from these other type of trimmers to prove my futility in finding a good clipper again!!  When I saw this new 2.0 version of my most favorite trimmer I swooped it up and just tested it out; it is EXACTLY THE SAME as my old one and I literally hugged and kissed it several times due to my happiness and joy!!  I have been buzzing my head for over 25 years and have literally spent hundreds on trimmers and clippers and have not found a single one that cuts and trims as close as this Remington does! I bought 4 more just in case so I should be set for life now!  In conclusion, I can&#x27;t recommend this trimmer/clipper enough and would say order one and try it out and see why I am so giddy and happy about this product!</li>
    <li> It made clean up very minimal</li>
    <li> Perfect for shaving your own head. Vacuums it up while you shave. It does what it describes! No complaints at all.</li>
    <li> Very pleased. Happy to see Remington bring back this product.</li>
    <li> I love this vacuuming set. It cuts the mess in half at least. There are many options for hair length to chose and you can swap them out all the time. My husband has very, very thick hair and this little thing packs in enough to only need to empty it when I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now. I&#x27;ve had no issues. I always use a little brush to get off all the little hairs and then lubricate the blade with oil to keep it rust free and sharp. Works great.</li>
    <li> Been using this for months and this is still working great. I love having the vacuum part to keep most of those little hairs getting all over the place. Doesn&#x27;t pull hair and the attachments are easy to get on and off.</li>
    <li> Had an older model for 10 years. Loved it enough to bye this model</li>
    <li> Works great no hair all over the floor</li>
    <li> Good product, it does the job and collects the hair cut, too. The cutting teeth are quite small though for someone with long hair. It works with 220V as well.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend! I&#x27;ve had one of these for 10 years! If you cut your own hair this is what you need to have. I won&#x27;t cut my hair with anything else, finally replaced the old one after 10 years, and it was still running just a little slower so retired it.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s amazing haircut especially for kids, just a little bit hair come out almost 90percent go inside the kit, I have one ten year ago still working perfect just only the clip easy drop off whenever I use, I try many times to find online finally I got it! After that, my sister in-law(husband side) and my brother asked me to help them each one buy one too, don&#x27;t wait! Go and get it now!</li>
    <li> I bought an older version of these same clippers, and have been waiting for a new version. I LOVE the vacuum aspect. Although it doesn&#x27;t catch every single hair, it gets the majority. I would never go back to regular clippers again. Bought a second pair as a spare just in case.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product and nicely thoughtout. The product its self is very lightweight and easy to use. I was really looking for justa simple razor but when i saw this remington i was curious that it could have enough power to limit cleanup. The performance of the unit is excellent i would say that it captures about 98% of the hair timings.</li>
    <li> Have not used often enough. I have a full beard and am using the lowest (1/8th) plastic guide. So Far, So Good. Am waiting for my &amp;#34;sparse&amp;#34; hair to grow some-what for my wife to give me a haircut (trim). Hoping for the BEST.</li>
    <li> Love!  No more hair pieces all over!</li>
    <li> Love this thing! No more messes in the bathroom with my haircuts :)</li>
    <li> Works great. I will never use a pair of clips without the vacuum feature again.</li>
    <li> I had the previous model for 7+ years, still running great, but making a noise so I wanted to get a back up or replacement just in case.&lt;br /&gt;I started using this new one for about a month and some spring or something broke and the razor came off. Since I still have the original, I simply swapped out spring/reattached the razor it is running fine. If that did not happened, I would give this unit 5 stars-- I almost paid $250 for a used one on Ebay in those couple of years this unit wasn&#x27;t available. Now that I am down to one unit again, I am buying a backup right now after I write this.</li>
    <li> Replaced my ten year old one, same unit but even better. The included traveling bag is not the one shown on the photo. It&#x27;s a bit lesser quality and hard to close when you try and put everything back in. Too bad!!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t have this yet but it is replacing an identical one I already have been using for 8 years. It is time to replace it.</li>
    <li> Like so many others, we were so happy to see this item come back.  My wife cuts my hair as well as our 2 sons hair at least once per month, We like it short.  Our last one was close to dying after 8 years and we could not find this model for a while.  As soon as I saw it listed, I grabbed one.&lt;br /&gt;It cuts nicely and keeps the vast majority of the hair clippings off of our necks.  I cannot express how much we like this clipper.</li>
    <li> 08/14/2015&lt;br /&gt;Had a like device for over 10 years and wanted a new one.  Works excellent with very little clean up.  Just about all shaving caught by the device.  Works the same if not better than the old one.&lt;br /&gt;wjc</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry but it sounds like a vacuumed, too loud!</li>
    <li> Was SO surprised this product come back, as it was discontinued for about 3 yrs..  It&#x27;s vacuum feature doesn&#x27;t suck up 100% of all cut hair, but most of it.. which is good enough for me.  I cut my own hair once a week as I have been doing so for over 7+ yrs now.. Barbers are over priced &amp; never seem to get it right.  I was buying these new Remington vacuum clippers about every year or so(just to get the sharpest blades).. &amp; it works great!  (I&#x27;m fully stocked for a while now) I highly recommend these A+ vacuum clippers to anyone.  THANKS Remington for bringing this awesome product back!!</li>
    <li> Purchased march 22 2015.  not working at all June 10.  Was great the twice I was able to use it, the vaccuum feature is brilliant  But not the life expectancy I had in mind...</li>
    <li> Gives a close cut, and cleans up most of the hair it removes.  Great product works as described.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT. I had my original HKVAC2000 since 2004 and was VERY happy to see a new one on the market. My 2004 just gave up the ghost s few weeks ago. I shave my hair down to the 3mm length, clip in set, and have not been to a Barber since the 2004 purchase. Thank you SO MUCH!</li>
    <li> Before receiving it, I was a bit worried about the noise plus the buzzing of the blades might get too loud for my sensitive 6yo boy but it wasn&#x27;t bad at all! It sounds like a a low-pitch mini vacuum and that&#x27;s it! It trims off hair smoothly. However, for little ones, I wish it comes with shorter guide combs in 9mm and 12mm thicknesses. Overall, it is great!</li>
    <li> Used this clipper to trim my hair ( I keep my head trimmed very short all over. ).  I trimmed close and collected every bit of hair that very easy to drop in the waste bin.  The clipper itself feels very light and flimsy, but works as I expected.</li>
    <li> This replaced one that was dropped and IS an improvement over the old model.  Vacuum is stronger.  My only &#x27;complaint&#x27; is that the blades are not the titanium as were the old ones.  Very happy that Remington still had this product.</li>
    <li> This is my second one of these great clippers they do dull after use but the last one lasted me 2 years before the cord started coming apart</li>
    <li> Great device! So glad Remington brought it back.</li>
    <li> Great product, leaves very lite to no cleanup</li>
    <li> I was waiting to use these a few times before reviewing them since a few reviews said that they only worked a couple of times and just stopped. After 5 uses I have to say that These are the best purchase I&#x27;ve made since I opted to switch from system razors to an electric razor. I have a buzz cut and try to keep it cut once a week. These clippers do exactly what they say and suck up the hair as I cut it. The chamber that holds the hair has much more space than you would think from looking at it. These clippers are easy on the eyes, in my opinion, and their power cord while I&#x27;ve owned clippers that had longer cords, the cord on these is long enough for me. One last thing I will say is that these are much larger than I thought they would be. It&#x27;s about 20% larger than the Wahl chrome hair clippers I was previously using and I&#x27;d say 50% larger than the Vidal Sassoon clippers I was using before those. They still do fit comfortably in my hands though.</li>
    <li> Wow...after more than 2 years of being discontinued, it is back on the market again. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t purchase a different brand. I had an old one for about 4-5 years now and I was just stretching it b/c it is about end of life. I was so glad to find the same one again on Amazon. I bought 2 of them :-). Great product!</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> Great Product....No Mess at all...The vaccum Work&#x27;s Great.....Amazon is the BEST.......Since I Ever Signed Up for Amazon, I have never had to return any of my Products Back.....All the Best Amazon.....</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS! I picked up the older version from a bargain store shortly after it was discontinued. I bought two of these just in case!&lt;br /&gt;I use one on our dog and the other to cut my husband and grandfather&#x27;s hair! Multi-use!&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a fail-proof no hair on the floor deal, but it minimizes mess! The vacuum is stronger in this model than the older one. I&#x27;m so pumped its back in production!</li>
    <li> What a fantastic product! I bought one 10-12 years ago and used it for years until I somehow lost the cutting blade. When I tried to replace it I found that they were no longer on the market. Now they are finally back and better than ever, saving me a lot of cash that I would be spending at the barber or salon. This is the greatest thing since the wheel, thank you so much Remington for bringing it back!</li>
    <li> Best home clippers ever</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this product. It is actually not a vacuum clipper. It is a normal clipper with a little container.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is very bulky in size, but has very little weight, giving it a very &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; feeling, and making it difficult to maneuver precisely.&lt;br /&gt;More importantly, the vacuum feature is useless. I tried trimming my hair to 1&amp;#34;, and after ten seconds, looked down to see hair ALL OVER my bathroom sink and floor, and very little of it in the catch.&lt;br /&gt;The accessories that come with it are cheap, too. I would rather they skipped the scissors and combs, and put more quality into the tool itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to my worst enemy.</li>
    <li> This actually works! Hallelujah, I was going crazy with my husbands daily beard trimmings all over the sink. I was skeptical that this would actually be able to catch all the trimmings but it does! Problem solved.</li>
    <li> Read the Update after the main review!  Hi! I am a veteran and I cut my hair to its root. It should not be a difficult task for a good, well-reviewed hair clipper brand, right? Not even two months in use and these clippers began pulling my 1/5 of an inch hair, during cutting. My last cut was today, like 5 minutes ago, and I was fed enough. The vacuum part of it is great! As for the actual clipper... Sorry, it failed for me.  2 Stars, thanks to the vacuum.  I bought this item because of the positive reviews. My 1st mistake of this sort!  *** Update, August 11th, 2015: Today I called the company, Spectrum Brands, Inc. and with only one question about the product, which was &amp;#34;When did you purchase the clippers?&amp;#34;, the customer service rep took my name, address, phone number, and said that a new Remington Vacuum Hair clippers will be sent to me, plus a return slip for my old ones to return! All done in 3 minutes!  Needless to write, I was stunned by this outstanding customer service! I raise my rating to a 4 star!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> No need for a sheet on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;It catches all the clippings.</li>
    <li> Love it but buy it direct from remington for 50$</li>
    <li> I had the previous model which lasted me about 8-9 years, but Remington has definitely taken it up a more than a notch with this one. I hope I get as much use out of this.</li>
    <li> Did a great job as expected!  Would recommend highly!</li>
    <li> Awesome clipper. Owned one before and it lasted years and cut my hair and my kids here with no mess would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase. After many years, I dulled the blade on my old Remington Vacuum clippers. ...but I&#x27;m back. The only decent vacuum clippers I know of. Saves a lot of time cleaning up a hairy mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convenient bag, lots of attachments. This newer version has a much smaller plug which is good. Probably the only clippers I&#x27;ll ever buy</li>
    <li> I love that when I use it there&#x27;s no hair mess every were</li>
    <li> It works awesome and is very smooth. Doesn&#x27;t pull hair. It doesn&#x27;t grab every single bit of hair (and I never expected it to) but it gets close to it! Definitely impressed! I would recommend to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only peeve is that its not cordless, but its not the end of the world.</li>
    <li> I worked great for 4 haircuts. Then a spring in the clipper head broke. I have contacted Customer Service and they have not gotten back to me (It&#x27;s been 3 weeks).</li>
    <li> This is amazing machine, I used before. I bought 7 years ago at CVS store, there are no more in any stores, I found only at Amazon prime.  I will recommend this product with 💯 %</li>
    <li> I had the previous model for as long as I can remember.... at least 5-7 years. It was always a great set of clippers so I was excited to see the new model on Amazon. After my first cut with these new clippers, I can say I anticipate the same amount of quality. Two things I noticed right away... the plug isn&#x27;t ginormous like the previous one (awesome!) and the bag is almost twice the size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never used the previous version of these clippers, I can say I highly recommend them. It really is no mess. It catches pretty close to every piece of hair. I can have my hair cut without any cape on and can go about my day without having that itchy feeling on the back of my neck. The compartment that catches hair is also a decent size. I keep my hair short and cut it about every 3 weeks and have only ever filled it about halfway. The kit also includes pretty much every attachment any other set comes with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is great too. I got it around $42. The Remington website lists it for $50. I&#x27;ve never seen them on the shelves in any store so I couldn&#x27;t give you a comparison on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, great clippers. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Works fine. You just have to go slowly in all directions to get an even cut. I must say that I&#x27;ve only used it once so far and my hair was quite&lt;br /&gt;long at the time. Next time should be much easier to deal with.</li>
    <li> I have a toddler who literally we have had to hold still to cut his hair because he HATES it touching him. It was literally a traumatic experience for all involved every time his hair got too long. Someone recommended I look for a buzzer like this...and seriously this was the BEST purchase I have ever made. No tears, no fighting, 10 minutes and we were done. No hair everywhere...life-saver</li>
    <li> It only lasted a month. For whatever reason, it only turned on when held vertical. If used at any other angle, it would turn off. I had to throw it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After breaking it open, it looked like the wires were soldered poorly and may have lost contact in different positions. Too bad there was no way to put the unit back together after opening it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased another one... because it&#x27;s the only game in town. Hopefully it won&#x27;t disappoint again.</li>
    <li> Been waiting for this product to come out. It cuts as well as it looks and feels. Just amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone that needs to cut they,re hair themselves. Quiet too.</li>
    <li> This does a good job cutting hair, and the vacuum part makes it easy as most hair goes in the cup.  That being said it&#x27;s my opinion that the clipper part isn&#x27;t as good as other clippers.  Usually there is a lever that you can use to adjust the clipper blade and give you more control over the length of hair, so that if you want a length between two of the clipper combs just move the lever.  This is something I use all the time, and miss having on this clipper.</li>
    <li> WHOLE SYSTEM WAS NEW EVERTHING IN TACK AND IN WORKING ORDER POWERFUL MOTOR , VERY IMPRESS WITH THE QUALITY. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU</li>
