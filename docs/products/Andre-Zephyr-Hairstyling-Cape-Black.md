      <li>This cape looks good and keeps hair and water off the client.</li>
      <li>Love this cape!  </li>

      <li>Update 5 years later - still working great for family haircuts!</li>
      <li>Love the velcro.  </li>
      <li>but if you need more coverage then it might be an issue.</li>
      <li>and I will deffinetly buy a couple more of these for sure.</li>

      <li>Glad to have it.</li>
      <li>So glad to have purchased this.  </li>
      <li>It is much better.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>It is perfect for the occasional home use.  </li>
      <li>This cape folds away better and does not trap in moisture like the plastic type.  </li>
      <li>(See photo at top of page.)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
      <li>what more can i say ....</li>
      <li>The material is nice to the touch as it has a quality to it, and fits comfortable around the neck.</li>
      <li>Hair did seem to stick to it, but I think it was a static issue, and since I washed (front load washer, I don&#x27;t think it would survive an agitator) it has not had the cling problem.</li>
      <li>when I saw this on Amazon it appears to be a full cape!</li>
      <li>This piece of cover prevents to fall the trimmed hairs on the body and save from itchy and it is easy to use.</li>
      <li>Hair is easily removed and can be folded for storage.</li>
      <li>It will work fine</li>
      <li>The cape itself is fine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 5&#x27;10\\&quot; and it fits just fine.</li>
      <li>This is perfectly fine.  </li>
      <li>I realized after I used it for the first time however that it may have been better to get a longer cape to cover more of my legs during haircuts.  </li>
      <li>Fine for home haircuts.  </li>
      <li>The cape works fine and is as advertised.  </li>
      <li>I wear a 18.5\\&quot; neck size on my collared shirts and the size and fit of the Velcro closure did not seem to be an issue for me.</li>
      <li>Still works great a year or two later.</li>
      <li>Great Value, only 10 bucks, it does the job</li>
      <li>This has got to be the most exciting cape I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
      <li>It comes with decent quality and nice style.</li>
      <li>The velcro could also be better, snaps would be good, as suggested by other users...</li>
      <li>Good enough for the haircut at home.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not a bad product either.</li>
      <li>It would be nice if it were long all the way around, but it&#x27;s definitely not a big deal and this is great for the price and for how often we use it.</li>
      <li>Good quality, so I can tell it will hold up for a long time.</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s designed to do!</li>
      <li>So professional and stylish.  </li>
      <li>The hair rolls right off cape, unlike the cheapo barber cape that my clippers came with.</li>
      <li>This came in very fast...</li>
      <li>Exactly what i was looking for.</li>
      <li>For the price and the intended use, this does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
      <li>Very inexpensive, but worth every dime.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>This works great for young and old, the only thing I would improve would be to replace the velcro with snaps.</li>
      <li>in an unnecessarily large box.</li>
      <li>Nice product, but wish it can be longer, so when my little guy grow up, I can use it still.</li>
      <li>Heavy duty and worth the little extra cost, expect many years of use, great product.  </li>
      <li>Very sturdy.</li>
      <li>The velcro closure is very adjustable.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s comfy and has enough velcro to fit snugly around both their necks.</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t really heed his or her warning.</li>
      <li>Much heavier than the one provided with the hair clipper kit.</li>
      <li>Hangs on the wall in our laundry room and is there ready for us.</li>
      <li>It makes it very sizeable but the hair does stick to the velcro.</li>
      <li>It would not withstand the daily constant use of a professional salon, but for the odd at home trim it is perfect.</li>
      <li>It folds up nice and small</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money, and I would like to recommend this item to those who wants a simple hairstyling cape.</li>
      <li>I would put this bargain up against the most expensive available.  </li>
      <li>Very soft and silky feeling.</li>
      <li>hair gets stuck on them after they are cut,making it more difficult to clean.</li>
      <li>I cut my husband&#x27;s hair and this is just like the professional hairstyling capes that are used at salons.  </li>
      <li>The cloth is soft an pliable.</li>
      <li>and I use this on my 7 and 3 year old.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this item for those who need such a thing.  </li>
      <li>The Velcro fastner neck has infinite size adjustment without worrying about snaps or buttons, and the material used in the neck piece is large enough to give equal coverage to the reverse side of where the cape hangs.  </li>
      <li>The picture does not show that the cape is very short in the back and does not drape the whole</li>
      <li>The main drawback is that the neck is a little large for my children.</li>
      <li>the valcro is kind of uncomfortable around the neck</li>
      <li>The cape works good when cutting children&#x27;s hair, but is too short on the back to keep hair off an adults back.  </li>
      <li>but the main problem is that, you see how the front comes all the way down to the thighs?</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> For the price and the intended use, this does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to. It&#x27;s a little thinner than I thought but it is for home use so its OK. Hair did seem to stick to it, but I think it was a static issue, and since I washed (front load washer, I don&#x27;t think it would survive an agitator) it has not had the cling problem. I wear a 18.5\\&quot; neck size on my collared shirts and the size and fit of the Velcro closure did not seem to be an issue for me.</li>
    <li> Bought this cape because my wife cuts my hair about twice a month and I was getting covered in hair.  The cape works fine and is as advertised.  I realized after I used it for the first time however that it may have been better to get a longer cape to cover more of my legs during haircuts.  Also the neck is a little high and my wife had to take part of the cape off to buzz cut around my neck.</li>
    <li> The cape itself is fine. The Velcro on the neck is not really suited for small children&#x27;s necks as there will be a gap but the main problem is that, you see how the front comes all the way down to the thighs? The back only has two flaps that cover the shoulder blades then stop. Another reviewer said that but I didn&#x27;t really heed his or her warning. It will work fine but if you need more coverage then it might be an issue. Very soft and silky feeling. Will do its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came in an unnecessarily large box. (See photo at top of page.)</li>
    <li> I am in the military and cut a bunch of my friends and families hair. This works great for young and old, the only thing I would improve would be to replace the velcro with snaps. The cloth is soft an pliable.</li>
    <li> the valcro is kind of uncomfortable around the neck so add a cloth between the cape.  It works great otherwise.</li>
    <li> This cape is wonderful. I am not a professional but cut my husband and my son&#x27;s hair monthly. It is made of nylon which is much cooler than the vinyl capes that come with the cutting shears. The hair also does not cling to the nylon like it can to the vinyl. It is a nice length, it will cover their knees while I am cutting. The only thing I do not like about the cape is the velcro closure. It makes it very sizeable but the hair does stick to the velcro. I am happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> My daughter in law recently learned how to cut hair. She is a stay at home mom, so this was a great gift to her.</li>
    <li> I am 5&#x27;10&#x27;&#x27; and it comes down about 3 inches past my knees. Exactly what i was looking for. Great price and I will deffinetly buy a couple more of these for sure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cape for 2 years now and it&#x27;s working great. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;10\\&quot; and it fits just fine. One thing I like is that hair doesn&#x27;t stick to it, so after the haircut I can just shake it to get the hair off it before folding it up. Also, the hair doesn&#x27;t stick in the velcro, which I&#x27;ve had issues before with previous capes where the velcro becomes useless once it&#x27;s full of hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve started cutting my husband&#x27;s and children&#x27;s hair and this seemed a step up from the old bedsheet. It is much better.  The main drawback is that the neck is a little large for my children. For my 4-year-old son I have to attach it on the very last bit of velcro. It is shorter in the back than the front. It would be nice if it were long all the way around, but it&#x27;s definitely not a big deal and this is great for the price and for how often we use it.</li>
    <li> This cape is a perfect size to cover the client completely, and a nice light weight. Good quality, so I can tell it will hold up for a long time. I also got excellent service from this seller. Would happily purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time. Very sturdy. Delivery time is great. I use it to cut my children&#x27;s hair and I use it when I get my hair done.</li>
    <li> The cape works good when cutting children&#x27;s hair, but is too short on the back to keep hair off an adults back.  Velcro neck catches loose hairs.</li>
    <li> The material is good...but the length of the back is too short,so the hairs still fall on the person&#x27;s back and chair. I thought it was similar to those used in salons and barbershops where it&#x27;s big enough to cover the person and chair. The velcro could also be better, snaps would be good, as suggested by other users...hair gets stuck on them after they are cut,making it more difficult to clean. I would still probably look for the bigger size (I buzz cut my husband&#x27;s hair...military) and use this one for myself,so the hair won&#x27;t stick on my clothes...</li>
    <li> Product received on time and execellent condition. Glad to have it. will recommend this product to my friend and family.</li>
    <li> Heavy duty and worth the little extra cost, expect many years of use, great product.  Much heavier than the one provided with the hair clipper kit.</li>
    <li> This is a very good quality haircut cape and it keeps the clipped hair where it belongs - off you.  It is of ample size and even gives a big guy like me plenty of coverage.  The Velcro fastner neck has infinite size adjustment without worrying about snaps or buttons, and the material used in the neck piece is large enough to give equal coverage to the reverse side of where the cape hangs.  I highly recommend this item for those who need such a thing.  I believe it would shed water, too, if you can think of a use for that.  (Doggy raincoat???)</li>
    <li> Great for when i give my husband hair cuts.  Good size, good adjustability of neck velcro.  Fabric seems just like what you have at a salon.</li>
    <li> So glad to have purchased this.  My son, who hates his hair to be cut, loved that fact that hair didn&#x27;t get on him.</li>
    <li> I cut my kids hair and I use this on my 7 and 3 year old. It&#x27;s comfy and has enough velcro to fit snugly around both their necks. It folds up nice and small so I can put it inside the travel case for my son&#x27;s clippers.</li>
    <li> This cape has worked well the last several times to cut my husbands hair. I cut my son&#x27;s as well, and it does what it needs to do.  Update 5 years later - still working great for family haircuts! Hangs on the wall in our laundry room and is there ready for us.</li>
    <li> My wife started cutting my hair about a year ago now. (Saves us a ton of money.) The kit we got did not come with a cape and this one works great. It is also thin so we can roll it up and put it in the kit we got when we are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Durable and perfect for anyone just cutting some hair at home.</li>
    <li> Fine for home haircuts.  Have had this for several months now and it remains flexible.  Appears to be durable.  I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Not too bad but the hairs tends to stick on the inside of the cape and are really hard to get rid of, I would not necessarily recommend it but it&#x27;s not a bad product either.</li>
    <li> Love this cape!  I cut my husband and sons hair and this cape is great!!  Love the velcro.  No snaps to break!!</li>
    <li> This has got to be the most exciting cape I&#x27;ve seen.  I would put this bargain up against the most expensive available.  So professional and stylish.  How much better could it get?</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This worked well for cutting my family&#x27;s hair to keep it from getting all over them.  I like the velcro neck closure especially.</li>
    <li> This cape looks good and keeps hair and water off the client. When it comes to capes there&#x27;s not really much to say but this does everything it says. You won&#x27;t go wrong with this (or any) cape.</li>
    <li> Great Value, only 10 bucks, it does the job what more can i say .... Money well spent. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very inexpensive, but worth every dime.  The material is nice to the touch as it has a quality to it, and fits comfortable around the neck.</li>
    <li> This came in very fast...within a week and I use this for cutting hair. It&#x27;s lightweight so it doesn&#x27;t trap heat and it&#x27;s long enough to keep hair off of the skin. I like it and would recommend.</li>
    <li> The hair rolls right off cape, unlike the cheapo barber cape that my clippers came with. :) Does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> I cut my husband&#x27;s hair and this is just like the professional hairstyling capes that are used at salons.  It works great.  The velcro closure is very adjustable.</li>
    <li> This piece of cover prevents to fall the trimmed hairs on the body and save from itchy and it is easy to use. I recommend this cover to anyone.</li>
    <li> when I saw this on Amazon it appears to be a full cape! It is a half cape in the back Almost useless</li>
    <li> Still works great a year or two later. We use it about every 6 weeks for my husband.</li>
    <li> This is perfectly fine.  It covers the client, is as tight around the neck as required, and the hair falls of the cape with a shake of the cape.</li>
    <li> Use this for cutting my kid&#x27;s hair.  Nice product, but wish it can be longer, so when my little guy grow up, I can use it still.</li>
    <li> The velcro stops too soon so you can&#x27;t get it tight around a 4 year old&#x27;s neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair also sticks to the cape rather than falling off, so it&#x27;s difficult to clean or store the cape after use.</li>
    <li> the item is just same as described</li>
    <li> top notch products, always great prices  to compare and will always recommend!! comes in handy when working with a radiator.</li>
    <li> Not too bad. I used it to cut my husband&#x27;s hair. It works as it claims. Good enough for the haircut at home.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I cut my husbands hair from home. I purchased a cape for him, but realized I&#x27;m itchy afterwards! So I purchased this. It is similar to his, but with velcro, which is easier than snaps as I put it on myself. It is the perfect size (I am a plus sized woman and it covered all that needed to be covered). Hair is easily removed and can be folded for storage.</li>
    <li> The picture does not show that the cape is very short in the back and does not drape the whole body.&lt;br /&gt;The velcro around the neck is uncomfortable. It was an inexpensive cape so I think this is all why.</li>
    <li> I have over the years used the buzz cutter to trim my sons hair.  This cape was the best investment I could have made.  It is perfect for the occasional home use.  It would not withstand the daily constant use of a professional salon, but for the odd at home trim it is perfect.</li>
    <li> We were using a plastic cape that came with the kit.  The family hated it.  This cape folds away better and does not trap in moisture like the plastic type.  We continue to save time and money by cutting our hair at home.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the product. Thanks!</li>
    <li> It comes with decent quality and nice style. Definitely worth the money, and I would like to recommend this item to those who wants a simple hairstyling cape.</li>
