      <li>I hate to shave, but now that I&#x27;m retired I don&#x27;t have to shave every day unless I just want to, this Rotoshave is something different, so I enjoy the newness of something different and it does a pretty good job,</li>
      <li>They last a few uses each nothing special.</li>

<li> this item is not what I expected.</li>
<li> then the closeness is gone after 3-4 shaves and I must load it up again just to leave the house - since the bad one gets exactly half the hair before I realize I better have another roller</li>
<li> However, when I placed my order and received them from Amazon, I got only about 10 shaves before they went dull.</li>
<li> it looks as though the cost would be coming down...</li>
<li> Not a clean shave and still leaves bumps after shaving.</li>
<li> And for a black man, that&#x27;s heaven!    </li>
<li> Sorry, 60 bucks a month just to use this razor is too much.&lt;br</li>
<li> It was a real disappointment to me.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed with the blade cartridge.</li>

    <li> These rollers are made in Israel and are of much higher quality and more durable than the previous rollers I had, which were made in China.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with the blade cartridge. It did not shave me without hurting my skin.Before I had bought the rollers from the Emjoi web site where I purchased my Rotoshaver  and they have always given me a nice clean shave. This roller replacement hurts .It&#x27;s as if the wires/blades are out of line and causes scraping to your skin. I won&#x27;t use them anymore.</li>
    <li> I hate to shave, but now that I&#x27;m retired I don&#x27;t have to shave every day unless I just want to, this Rotoshave is something different, so I enjoy the newness of something different and it does a pretty good job, not faster or closer than a blade, but different and acceptable to me.</li>
    <li> you can&#x27;t beat this shaver.  the shave is quicker, closer and more comfortable than any shaver, including a blade.  there is zero irritation and the price is right.  simply the best.</li>
    <li> as advertised--Well packaged --Very quick shipment! Thanks</li>
    <li> i ordered this for my son he loves them. that is all he uses.the shave is close but does the job. we plan on buying more.</li>
    <li> Turned out to be women&#x27;s rollers rather than men&#x27;s. Should still work. Just kind of strange that this was not clear in sale information.</li>
    <li> My husband used it on his face &amp; it really got rid of the hair.I will recommend this to my friends &amp; family.</li>
    <li> this item is not what I expected. You have to use shaving cream with this item and it didn&#x27;t work too well on my face.</li>
    <li> Very good buy I am pleased</li>
    <li> Love it love it love it</li>
    <li> In simple terms, clean shave with and no after affect of razor bumps!  And for a black man, that&#x27;s heaven!    Big Elder</li>
    <li> The Rotoshave is the best electric razor I have ever used.  The replacement rollers were very easy to install and work just as good as the original roller.</li>
    <li> The. Best in shave thank you John s. Ruggiero</li>
    <li> Sorry, 60 bucks a month just to use this razor is too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It works great the first time. then the closeness is gone after 3-4 shaves and I must load it up again just to leave the house - since the bad one gets exactly half the hair before I realize I better have another roller handy - at ten bucks a pop. I feel enslaved and robbed [and sometimes clean-shaven] at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re rich and can afford 60-100 bucks a month, order ten at a time - and shaddup.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery without a hitch Great job Guys and gals!</li>
    <li> eXCELLENT close shave with no nicks!  easy to replace and sharpness lasts a long time as well. The razor holds a charge well</li>
    <li> My husbands face thanks you everyday!</li>
    <li> They last a few uses each nothing special. I got a great deal on them and they have been worth it.</li>
    <li> Since I purchased the Roto Shave back in August 2011 it has worked well. I am now replacing the baldes with new ones. I use this shaver for both Head and Facial shaving, it does a great job and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Gotta have these to go with the razor, great product.  Ships from Israel, and had to sign for the package - wasn&#x27;t home so took an extra day to get the product, but worth the wait.</li>
    <li> will probably order more in the future. good blades and they are the only things that fit. love that razor also.</li>
    <li> The blades that I got when I purchased my RotoShaver from a commercial was great, I got about 75 shaves from the blades. However, when I placed my order and received them from Amazon, I got only about 10 shaves before they went dull. It was a real disappointment to me. Wish I kept the information when I purchased my shaver and not discarded it so fast.</li>
    <li> These are really good blades--------But the cost is so high, is there a substitute---We are going to have to change systems. these have been on the market for some time it looks as though the cost would be coming down...</li>
