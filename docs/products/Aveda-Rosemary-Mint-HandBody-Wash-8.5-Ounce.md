<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the smell of this</li>
    <li> I love the product itself, but the top of the pump was broken completely off upon arrival. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this as well as the lotion online. The lotion smells really good its the wash and which smells like some walmart bought soap. Next time I decide to buy Ill probably go to an Aveda store. Im thinking someone used all the product and put in some cheap soap to sell as the Rosemary mint wash online.</li>
    <li> Love the refreshing smell</li>
    <li> I use this on my bathroom as a hand wash.  The smell is strong immediately and then quickly dissipates, leaving you with clean hands.  Not appropriate for young children who may get it in their eyes or use it on their mouth.  My husband, who is an allergy sufferer &amp;#34;loves&amp;#34; the smell and says it reminds him of a spa.</li>
    <li> Quick to ship, the item was received as described. Love this product! Will buy from again in the future. Thank you for a smooth transaction.</li>
    <li> Expensive but worth the money in my books. We use this in our rental and get comments on it all the time as reflecting the &#x27;quality&#x27; of our apartment. And smells great too.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this. I love how it smells (gender neutral without seeming pretentious about it but really soothing and refreshing). I love the exact right amount of lather it produces and how it doesn&#x27;t leave a film on my skin. I love the faint but noticeable scent that follows me around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is expensive as heck but worth it (even to me, who rarely wears makeup and isn&#x27;t a fashionista by any stretch). My hint is to buy the smaller bottle, then buy the big one and refill this pump bottle. It&#x27;s quality and will last.</li>
    <li> The smell is wonderful first thing in the morning, waking the senses and it leaves your skin hydrated. The quality of the product is worth the cost.</li>
    <li> The pump was broken and there was tape on it  which looked like shipping tape but was tape holding pump on.</li>
    <li> I splurged on this hand soap after using it at a restaurant in Palm Springs. I love the smell, but do wish there was more of a lather when you wash your hands.</li>
    <li> I love the scent and how soft it leaves my skin. A nice pick me up for early morning showers. Refreshing and soothing all at the same time. Some mint products can be a bit too tingly. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This does not create any suds unless you use A LOT.</li>
    <li> I love Aveda Rosemary Mind Shampoo and Condition, so I decided to order Hand and Body Wash. However it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. This product is greatly overpriced. I’d rather buy less expensive brands of better quality.</li>
    <li> Years ago, I was given an Aveda rosemary mint bath bar at Christmas, and the first time I used it, I absolutely loved it. The smell is wonderful, and it takes soap to another level. However, when I figured in shipping with the bath bar, it came out to $2.90 an oz., and since it just lasted me approximately three months, I decided that it was just too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when I went to the Aveda site, I found the 33.8 oz. bottle and, with shipping, it cost $1.62 an oz., vs. the $2.70 an oz. for the 8.5 oz bottle. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year, and I still have about a third of a bottle. That&#x27;s cost effective enough for me to be able to continue with it, thank goodness! If you use two or three pumps per washing, it probably won&#x27;t last that long, but I found that one pump was adequate enough because it lathers quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, Aveda, make this forever, because I can&#x27;t imagine bathing with anything else.</li>
    <li> Love the rosemary mint smell and just need small amount with a loofa.  Makes me feel cleaner than other body washs.</li>
    <li> always purchase the wash and lotion annually. Makes spring special.  The scent of the rosemary and mint wake you up happy and the scent lasts nicely. Great for workplace that doesnt like use of perfumes. Its light, but noticable without being overpowering. And it has that energizing smell of rosemary/mint in perfect combintion.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this, so I will take her word.  She is very happy,  the only bad thing is the price.  If they brought that down they would sell way more</li>
    <li> Love this we use it as hand soap and it has been great!  Gets hands clean and aromatherapy to boot.</li>
    <li> I use this body wash in the shower.  I am going to buy another bottle for my sink.  It might seem pricey, but I have been using generous amounts every day for a month and I still have practically the entire bottle left.  It has a clean, minty smell - not overpowering.  It is refreshing and smooth.  I will always be in stock of this stuff!</li>
    <li> smells wonderful and lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> The best thing about this product is how fresh and natural you smell.  As an added benefit, you repel garden bugs (it&#x27;s the rosemary, silly!), and your skin feels happy.  When your skin feels happy, you are happy all over.  When you&#x27;re happy all over, then you know you&#x27;re sure to show it, and the world is better too, don&#x27;t &#x27;cha know it!  We could use a happier, better world!</li>
