      <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought a 3 pack.</li>
      <li>Also, this smells better than competitors.</li>

      <li>This is the best brand of dry shampoos I have tried.</li>
      <li>This stuff is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever found.  </li>

      <li>Great for a quick fix when you&#x27;re short on time!</li>
      <li>This is a great product which a friend recommended, not only does it look like your hair is freshly shampooed it also adds volume.</li>
      <li>clean-</li>
      <li>My scalp was bright yellow.  </li>
      <li>4 full days since a hair-wash</li>
      <li>It also helps to shake it, especially a new can, so the color isn&#x27;t too concentrated.</li>
      <li>It is more white in color</li>
      <li>Just make sure you shake it up well when you first get it because the first couple of squirts can get a bit yellow.</li>
      <li>I love this dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried tons of dry shampoos and Batiste is one of my favorite brands.</li>
      <li>Love the dry shampoo effect......</li>
      <li>I cant live without this stuff!!</li>
      <li>Works extra great on roots, as the slight color makes it look</li>
      <li>By far the best dry shampoo I have found and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.</li>
      <li>(Depending on how much you use and if you brush out, etc.</li>
      <li>and you really have to brush it in a lot</li>
      <li>The light blonde color helps to cover my roots between highlights too!  </li>
      <li>It instantly refreshes hair and smells really nice, no residue left over either.</li>
      <li>I have mousey brown hair that I highlight to a dark caramel-blonde and this is great for me as long as I don&#x27;t spray it too close to my scalp</li>
      <li>I have tried many other brands, and really don&#x27;t like how they come out super white.</li>
      <li>Love the lightness, immediate drying, and slight color</li>
      <li>This stuff really works, and it does not leave a white residue like most dry shampoos.</li>
      <li>This dry shampoo does come out pretty yellow, but its nice to use in moderation, especially when you need your roots done.</li>
      <li>I showered Friday morning, went camping Friday night, used the product Sunday morning after my scalp started to get a little greasy, and it&#x27;s now Monday night and my hair still looks and feels pretty dang clean.</li>
      <li>Cannot live without.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
      <li>I LOVE normal Batiste dry shampoo and use it daily, but the first time I used this blonde version (and I&#x27;m very blonde)</li>
      <li>The blonde color blends in nicely after a minute or two, even on my dark blonde hair.</li>
      <li>(then it shows up a little too light).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find in stores and this is a much better value.</li>
      <li>Plus, it&#x27;s a great freshen-up for dirty locks and as blondes know....</li>
      <li>The next morning just brush and your ready to go.  </li>
      <li>I have spent about $10-15 dollars more on other products that don&#x27;t work as well as Batiste.</li>
      <li>Used on fine, curly, dark blonde hair.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue like other dry shampoos and does not have a strong smell.  </li>
      <li>maybe not fresh washed but clean enough.</li>
      <li>so I would really recommend going with the colored versions (although I can&#x27;t personally speak to anything but the blonde).</li>
      <li>The light blonde tint helps disguise my black roots between getting it dyed!</li>
      <li>So no more Light and Blonde for me; I&#x27;ll stick with the non-colored version.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference between the regular Batiste and the Blonde version on my medium blonde</li>
      <li>I love the blonde, it does leave behind some yellowish residue</li>
      <li>Makes hair feel soft and looks fresh, and doesn&#x27;t smell bad either - just a fresh scent.</li>

    <li> Homemade to expensive...I&#x27;ve tried them all it&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> I LOVE normal Batiste dry shampoo and use it daily, but the first time I used this blonde version (and I&#x27;m very blonde), I was leaning down to get something and my husband and 2 daughters said &amp;#34;What&#x27;s on your head!??&amp;#34;.....My scalp was bright yellow.  So no more Light and Blonde for me; I&#x27;ll stick with the non-colored version.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons of dry shampoos and Batiste is one of my favorite brands. I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference between the regular Batiste and the Blonde version on my medium blonde hair-- I&#x27;ve been happy with both versions. One can lasts quite a while. I&#x27;m so glad I bought a 3 pack. Great price, hides the oil in my hair well, and gives it great lift/volume.</li>
    <li> I love this dry shampoo. Works well without drying my hair out. It&#x27;s hard to find in stores and this is a much better value.</li>
    <li> love this stuff!  And the quick delivery!</li>
    <li> I just got back from my Memorial Day camping trip. I showered Friday morning, went camping Friday night, used the product Sunday morning after my scalp started to get a little greasy, and it&#x27;s now Monday night and my hair still looks and feels pretty dang clean. 4 full days since a hair-wash and I&#x27;m stoked with the results. But now it&#x27;s time to wash out the campfire smell :)&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;Nice smell, works great for my dishwater blonde colored hair. Just lightly dust on my hair line and brush through and I can go for 12-24 more hours.</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo made my hair fried, brittle and fall out!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product which a friend recommended, not only does it look like your hair is freshly shampooed it also adds volume. Love it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever found.  The light blonde color helps to cover my roots between highlights too!  I spray along my part line, hairline around my face, and then lift up a few sections to spray underneath.  Then I rub in as if I were shampooing my hair.  I leave for a couple of minutes and then brush.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue like other dry shampoos and does not have a strong smell.  (2) tricks if you find there is powder residue:  1.  Put it in your hair at night before going to bed.  The next morning just brush and your ready to go.  2)  Use a brush with a bit of hairspray sprayed on it and run it through your hair a couple of minutes after adding to your hair.  It&#x27;ll help draw out the power.</li>
    <li> I like this dry shampoo. I have tried many other brands, and really don&#x27;t like how they come out super white. This dry shampoo does come out pretty yellow, but its nice to use in moderation, especially when you need your roots done. I have found that it can flake off onto clothes, so be mindful of that. Great product for the price</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have dark blond hair and this is perfect for hiding my roots. I have spent about $10-15 dollars more on other products that don&#x27;t work as well as Batiste. I will probably be a customer for life!</li>
    <li> BEST. DRY SHAMPOO. EVER!!! The light blonde tint helps disguise my black roots between getting it dyed!</li>
    <li> Finally a Dry shampoo that smells great!  Love the dry shampoo effect......but the smells of most brands were disgusting.  This brand also has the added color effect.  I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product.  My daughter and I can now get another day out of each washing and we are already noticing healthier hair because of it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so money. By far the best dry shampoo I have found and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few. With it I can go a week between shampoos (without it it starts to look greasy around day 3). It takes the shine and smell out, lightens the roots a little and makes it look generally clean- maybe not fresh washed but clean enough. I have mousey brown hair that I highlight to a dark caramel-blonde and this is great for me as long as I don&#x27;t spray it too close to my scalp (then it shows up a little too light). It also helps to shake it, especially a new can, so the color isn&#x27;t too concentrated. I&#x27;ve tried the regular uncolored version which is very white and you really have to brush it in a lot so I would really recommend going with the colored versions (although I can&#x27;t personally speak to anything but the blonde). This is a pretty good price although I have found it for around $7/can at T.J. Maxx on occasion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of brands of dry shampoo and Batiste is the best value and great quality.  I love the blonde, it does leave behind some yellowish residue so it&#x27;s important to use it sparingly and work it through the hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this dry shampoo for about year now and I order a 2-3 pack from Amazon so I don&#x27;t run out. For the reviews that say it comes out white or yellow -it is a dry shampoo and it has cornstarch in it. That is the ingredient that absorbs the oil. The blonde batiste is a little yellow. Hold it back away from your scalp and then comb or brush hair to take out some of the yellow.  Batiste has other dry shampoos and I have also tried the tropical scent one. It is more white in color but it smells great. This is the best brand of dry shampoos I have tried. Lots of scents to choose from.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, perfect for second day hair.  The blonde color blends in nicely after a minute or two, even on my dark blonde hair.</li>
    <li> Cannot live without.  Perfect for highlighted blondes who are between highlights.  Great way to inexpensively extend your highlights.  (Depending on how much you use and if you brush out, etc. you can utilize the yellow a bit).  Because it is colored you do need to pay attention when you put it on so as not to turn your scalp yellow…but very easy to fix and you learn that lesson quickly!</li>
    <li> Great for a quick fix when you&#x27;re short on time!</li>
    <li> Love the lightness, immediate drying, and slight color it adds - this is the best spray dry shampoo. Used on fine, curly, dark blonde hair. Give me lift on the weekends when I have to run out after sleeping in, or just adds a little boost at the end of the day to weighted down hair. Makes hair feel soft and looks fresh, and doesn&#x27;t smell bad either - just a fresh scent. Works extra great on roots, as the slight color makes it look like my hair hasn&#x27;t been slept-in. The 3-pack is the best value, as I go through one bottle about every 2-3 months (using 1-2 times weekly).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing, I recommend this to anyone. It instantly refreshes hair and smells really nice, no residue left over either.</li>
    <li> Works great on my hair, I hope they don&#x27;t stop making it! Batiste is the best.</li>
    <li> Not only is Batiste a godsend for those with oily scalps, it also covers roots and adds volume. What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!  Delays having to get highlights in my blonde hair by a week, sometimes two, which saves me money.  Plus, it&#x27;s a great freshen-up for dirty locks and as blondes know....dirty hair looks darker which makes your roots look bad.  I recommend this to all my friends.  Just make sure you shake it up well when you first get it because the first couple of squirts can get a bit yellow.</li>
    <li> Great product. Does not leave any white residue</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands and they don&#x27;t dry the oil as well.  Also, this smells better than competitors. Works well.</li>
    <li> I cant live without this stuff!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works, and it does not leave a white residue like most dry shampoos. It also helps freshen up the roots of grown out highlights. I never want to be without it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Leaves my hair feeling clean and smells good. Will purchase again when needed.</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo changed my life. No, really. i tried all of them.. it is the best!! I have the type of hair I usually have to wash everyday.. and this allows me to go days without rewashing.. i dont feel greasy or gross and my hair looks amazing!!</li>
