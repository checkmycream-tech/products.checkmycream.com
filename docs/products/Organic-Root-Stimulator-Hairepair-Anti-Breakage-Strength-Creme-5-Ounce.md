      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>It really does work for me!!!!</li>
      <li>Honestly I probably won&#x27;t purchase again because I love the intense moisture cream better.</li>
      <li>very great product i use every other night when i wrap my hair!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light but not greasy.  </li>
      <li>but when you only need a smidgen amount, you get a good deal.  </li>
      <li>Ive been combing my hair more often just to see if the results are real and</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s great if your looking for something other than a pomade type of hair cream.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing and light weight.</li>
      <li>I really love how it smells and how soft it makes my hair feel.  </li>
      <li>and Ive used many products including natural oils and none has done what this one has.</li>
      <li>This is a great hair cream to use while styling wet hair but because it is water based it can&#x27;t be used for water sensitive styles.</li>
      <li>A very light creme that is packed with ingredients known for their moisturizing &amp; strengthening qualities such as shea butter, coconut oil &amp; bamboo extract.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still on my first jar of this product.</li>
      <li>I pretty much just use this on my ponytail to reduce split ends.</li>
      <li>It was okay as far as making my hair look better but didn&#x27;t really care for how it left my hair feeling hours later!</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t really know what is in it.</li>
      <li>It really does help against breakage and it doesn&#x27;t have that oily slip or feel after so</li>
      <li>I did not notice much difference with this product.</li>
      <li>What I love about this product is that so little is needed and my hair stays moisturized and doesn&#x27;t break as much for the next day or two.  </li>
      <li>the way my coarse thick hair feels afterwards amazing cant wait to buy the real size</li>
      <li>I use it at night and my hair is so soft!</li>
      <li>When I finally ran out of the samples, gradually the breakage increased and was made more apparent when I tried to do a wet set on my hair.  </li>
      <li>I use this on my hair right after washing and let my hair air dry.  </li>
      <li>I received my conditioner today and the jar is busted and it appears that they tried to wrap it up in clear plastic wrap.  </li>
      <li>I am completely natural.</li>
      <li>I just started using this product and it&#x27;s too early to see miracles.</li>
      <li>My hair is processed and im not mixed so its pretty fragile.</li>
      <li>This is a penetrating anti breakage creme that can be used daily ands also directly to your ends for added protection against splitting.</li>
      <li>Your hair is left soft.</li>

    <li> This is a great hair cream to use while styling wet hair but because it is water based it can&#x27;t be used for water sensitive styles. That being said,I like the smell of this thick cream and it&#x27;s great if your looking for something other than a pomade type of hair cream.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Works great and service was awesome!</li>
    <li> This seems to be great product but I sampled a sample size that came along with ORS hair mayo. Also, I used this in combination with a Shea moisture product so I don&#x27;t know how well this product will stand by it&#x27;s self. I am plan t. I am planning to buy a regular size jar in the next week or two. I am only giving it a four stars because the sample jar did not have the ingredients listed so I don&#x27;t really know what is in it. But, I think it will be a staple product in my regimen. I used this product twice daily/7 days a week. I have 4b/c..very thick black hair. I am completely natural. It smells great and feels great. I love it.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and it&#x27;s too early to see miracles.</li>
    <li> love love love the way this smells and the way my coarse thick hair feels afterwards amazing cant wait to buy the real size</li>
    <li> This hair care line is amazing! I use it at night and my hair is so soft!</li>
    <li> This product has surpassed my expectations. I washed my hair on Monday And used it after i washed my hair. Not one strand has come out of my hair since and i am not exaggerating. Ive been combing my hair more often just to see if the results are real and every time i comb..NOTHING! Hard to believe right? Best believe it!  Cuz my dry hair is living proof. It really does help against breakage and it doesn&#x27;t have that oily slip or feel after so you can tell it penetrates. Your hair is left soft. I have naturally dry hair and Ive used many products including natural oils and none has done what this one has. I use it on my ends and use my castor oil on my roots. My hair is processed and im not mixed so its pretty fragile. I will forever buy this product and Ive recommended it to allll my friends since. Literally all of them. I tell anybody who I can about it cuz I just feel the world needs to know how beautiful this product is. Great product by ORS. Just fabulous!</li>
    <li> excellent and speedy delivery</li>
    <li> I received my conditioner today and the jar is busted and it appears that they tried to wrap it up in clear plastic wrap.  I want a replacement jar and or a refund.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, the texture and the results. This is a fabulous product and I will be ordering more!!</li>
    <li> very great product i use every other night when i wrap my hair! My hair is bleached a bit and it keeps it moustrized perfectly!!</li>
    <li> A very light creme that is packed with ingredients known for their moisturizing &amp; strengthening qualities such as shea butter, coconut oil &amp; bamboo extract. This is a penetrating anti breakage creme that can be used daily ands also directly to your ends for added protection against splitting. Two words...staple product!</li>
    <li> It was okay as far as making my hair look better but didn&#x27;t really care for how it left my hair feeling hours later!</li>
    <li> I have fragile 4a/b/c hair that is porous and breaks constantly.  I fairly recently did an slight modifications to my hair routine and plan to stick it out to see if my hair conditions improves.  Within that time period I came across samples of this product that I requested some time ago.  I incorporated this into my nightly moisturizing routine called the LOC (or LCO) method just to test it out and I was shocked on how quickly my hair improved.  I would say within five days, my breakage has been cut down to about 30% and decreasing.  I have never experienced anything that noticeably improved the state of my hair so quickly.  What I love about this product is that so little is needed and my hair stays moisturized and doesn&#x27;t break as much for the next day or two.  This is way better than some oils I have tried.  When I finally ran out of the samples, gradually the breakage increased and was made more apparent when I tried to do a wet set on my hair.  I went to several stores around me before I found it in some far-flung suburbs grocery stores.  It was a bit expensive but when you only need a smidgen amount, you get a good deal.  I hope ORS never changes the ingredients.</li>
    <li> I read about the company&#x27;s products in a magazine and decided to try them.  To date I am very pleased with the product.  It smells great and my hair feels a lot better.</li>
    <li> This product does what it&#x27;s required to do. It moisturizes and strengthens. I usually use it to style dry hair and it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African American with relaxed hair.  I just started my hair journey a month ago and I&#x27;ve been using this for a month already and I think it helps but I&#x27;m not really sure.  I&#x27;m still experiencing breakage.  I really love how it smells and how soft it makes my hair feel.  I don&#x27;t use a lot at once so I have a lot left in the jar which i will finish.  I might repurchase at a later date after trying other products.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  It&#x27;s light but not greasy.  Will have to see if it helps my problem area but so far, it&#x27;s great!!</li>
    <li> I did not notice much difference with this product. The smell is not nice at all. I always tried to mask it with peppermint oil. I would not repurchase this product as there are better products out there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve thrown away all my other products.  I am a convert to ORS.  I use this on my hair right after washing and let my hair air dry.  I feel that it has made a difference.</li>
    <li> You only need a small amount put on after washing hair let sit until hair air drys.i had very little breakage. I will continue to use this product.  It really does work for me!!!!</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and light weight.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still on my first jar of this product. I ordered this in OCT.  I do like it. I pretty much just use this on my ponytail to reduce split ends. I think it&#x27;s working... It smells great too. Honestly I probably won&#x27;t purchase again because I love the intense moisture cream better. I&#x27;m relaxed with 4C hair.</li>
