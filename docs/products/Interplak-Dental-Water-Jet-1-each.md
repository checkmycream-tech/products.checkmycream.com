<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is actually a Conair product so reviews under that name should be similar, for similar model. I found the jet to spray as it got to teeth rather than be more jet-like. Perhaps for that reason the jet was not strong enough. The machine was also entirely too noisy. I am returning it.</li>
    <li> We have owned an Interplak water jet for about 12-15 years.  It is so old I can&#x27;t remember when I bought it.  It is still working great (which is fantastic for a small appliance) so naturally when I needed a second unit for my vacation home, I purchased another Interplak from Amazon. However, I am extremely disappointed in the new unit.  We have owned it for about 6-8 weeks, and our old unit is far superior in almost every way.  About the only advantage of the new unit is that it is slightly more compact.  However, that is also the source of all the problems on the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water reservoir fits so tightly to the base that it is very difficult to remove.  You have to use so much force that you will knock all the extra tips onto the counter top.  So if you buy one, take all the tips you are not going to use every day and just put them away in a drawer somewhere.  In fact the reservoir is so difficult to remove that my wife finally just gave up and holds the entire unit under the faucet to fill the reservoir which is certainly not the safest thing to do since it is still plugged into the electrical outlet.  It is also almost impossible to use the unit without getting water all over the counter top.  Some of this is caused by the force needed to remove the reservoir and part is just the poor design o of the unit.  As another reviewer pointer out, the base is very light so the unit is top heavy when the water reservoir is filled.  Consequently, my wife and I have each already turned over the unit once soaking the counter top and everything on it.  We never have had this problem with the old unit. The light weight of the unit also makes it difficult to turn ther unit on or off with only one hand (you will have the water jet in the other).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that I would not recommend this model to a friend. Obviously, Interplak did not do enough field testing on this  model before going into production.</li>
    <li> Absolutely not the slickest and quickest, but it&#x27;s been hauled from one end of the country to the other, been treated with very little respect, and the darned thing keeps doing it&#x27;s job year after year. Takes up very little counter space, which is a  big plus.  I pick it up and refill it while using it...takes two tanks to do a decent job. But it does indeed do a decent job of cleaning those hard-to-reach places and I have no plans to replace it until it croaks.  Cheap, easy, just fine.</li>
    <li> If you want lots of pressure, a variable speed control, a large water reservoir, all for a reasonable price, I recommend you try this Interplak model. Yes the water hose coming out of the back of the machine is sort of clumsy (the coil dangles into the sink beneath my chin while I&#x27;m rinsing) but it is waterproof, and so what if it gets wet? I don&#x27;t know if the manufacturer could place the hose in any different position to eliminate this problem. Also because of the powerful motor the machine does do a little dance on the counter top after you flip the switch to on, but placing a small rubber (non-skid) pad under the machine will take care of that issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first bought this model 4-5 years ago -but a few months ago the motor died. I decided to try a different brand so bought a Waterpik (which cost more $$). What a mistake that was. The Waterpik: (i) did not hold much water (so had to be refilled at least once during each use), (ii) was not very powerful (so there was always some food left between my teeth), (iii) the battery had to be recharged every two days, and (iv) was completely hand held so the food particles being rinsed out of my mouth were always dripping into crevices on the machine! After two months I gave the Waterpik to the Good Will and bought another Interplak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> This is my 4th irrigation device.  Waterpik was the first.  Failed after a few months. Interplak for #2&lt;br /&gt;- 4. The 2nd (Interplak) lasted over 2 years - great device, just as this one is.  I rate it on performance, water pressure, etc.  The second failed finally with a split hose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought another Interplak (#3) and they designed functionality out of it.  It hardly ran and I had to run it several hours cumulatively to wear in the packings so it would develop pressure.  A lousy design but better than Waterpik.  When it died after a year or so I bought this little whizzer.  Good pressure.  I use a handy plastic glass to mix my H202 and salt solution and dump it in.  No problem with valves, etc.  IT WORKS GREAT and about $10 less than the last one.  Who needs the brushes, scrapers, etc.?  They&#x27;re in the drawer.</li>
    <li> Small footprint, takes little space; very quiet, smooth operation; water reservoir satisfactory although could be larger; very pleased so far and much superior to other irrigators I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> This is the worse model water jet I have ever owned.  The company replaced the first one that worked intermittently within 30 days.  The second one is no better. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t work. Even when I can get it to work, it often needs to be turned off and on multiple times.  Sometimes the water tank needs removed and put back on several times to get the unit to function. In addition it is flimsy, you need to push it against the wall to get it to hold still so you can turn it on. Their previous model worked fine but sprung pin hole leaks in the water feed tube.  Since that is not replaceable, I patched it numerous times with epoxy, which did get me an additional 6 months use out of it.  I was here, on Amazon, searching for a replacement when I noticed this unit for sale.  This is a poorly designed and poorly manufactured piece of equipment, I strongly advise that you look to another brand.  The company representative I spoke with was very good but good customer service is hardly a substitute for a quality product, this is most definitely not a quality product.</li>
    <li> Excellent unit, compact and powerful.  Delivery as promised.  Recommend the INTERPLAK to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this type of dental cleaning system makes your mouth feel really clean.  I like to use it before I brush, and again after.  My teeth feel like they&#x27;ve been professionally cleaned every day!</li>
    <li> This unit wasn&#x27;t a bad little cleaner..as long as it lasted. After about a year (I think) the handled started splitting apart and I had to squeeze the two halves together while running it so that the water wouldn&#x27;t leak out and run down my hand. At about the same time, it began developing a little leak at the bottom of the base unit, which always left a little puddle of water after usage.    On the other hand, the unit had plenty of pressure for MY mouth, the water container was sufficiently large for the volume output of the tip, and the coiled hose was sufficiently long.    Maybe it&#x27;s not so bad that it falls apart in a year or two. When the handle started falling apart, I noticed all the brown yucky junk building up inside. Maybe it was time to buy a new one anyway. Got a Waterpik this time--we&#x27;ll see. So far I&#x27;ve noticed it has a shorter hose, runs quieter, has higher pressure and volume, and a larger reservoir.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for one almost like it. The older one had a substantially heavier motor, which didn&#x27;t run obviously labored. But, so far the new one seems to be holding up in spite of groaning. And it cleans teeth well.</li>
    <li> My old Interplak { more than 5 years old} was still in working order .  The picture of the new one was identical to the one that we had .  How was I to know that the \\&quot;guts\\&quot; had been replaced with inferior products .  The new one will not \\&quot;self start\\&quot;  ; it must be siphoned .  It does not have the same power as the old one .  Shame !!!</li>
    <li> I should have read the reviews first!  Exactly as others had said it leaks out the bottom, on button is difficult to turn, so lightweight it vibrates and travels on its own around the countertop, and I suppose I don&#x27;t need to go on.  Cheaply designed and made.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a very handy and effective oral hygiene appliance. It offers a compact design and an easy-to-fill reservoir. The control knobs are easy to grasp and the range of power selections for the water jet should make it easy for any user to find one or more settings to suit their needs.    The selection of tips is interesting and useful.    Cons: The coiled tube is a bit stiff and might be a awkward for some people, however it does want to keep its shape, making it easier to store when finished. As mentioned in other reviews, it would be more convenient if the jet was normally \\&quot;off\\&quot; and the button on the handle needed to be pressed to start the flow rather than pressed and held to stop it. The unit is a bit noisy and tends to move around the sink countertop on its own when in use. I minimized this by buying a package of stick-on rubber disks about 1\\&quot; in diameter and a local hardware store and sticking them on the bottom. Works very well.</li>
    <li> I have used one of these for the past 5 years and this new one works just like it should.  The water jet cleans well and quickly.  Since I started using these, the lady that cleans my teeth always comments on how little work that she has to do, as my teeth stay clean.</li>
    <li> The reservoir is smaller then I thought, and it takes awhile after turning on for the water to start flowing.  The one and off switch at times is hard to operate, I do like the compactness of the product.</li>
    <li> long time user of these devices. started with waterpik and switched after a few years due to the 100 decibel noise level of that unit. happy i changed. the interplak was superior. firstly, and this is still true of the new model WJ6R, the the water spray is ideal. the waterpik is too sharp. the interplak is perfect at all the pressure settings.     low noise (yeah!).     this is where the new model fails:    -pressure is too low even at high. new pump motor is weak.  -the pump is no longer self priming. if you let the tub empty during use (easy to do), one must refill and suck the sprayer to get the      flow again.   -the new unit is so light that if your sink is wet the poor little machine vibrates around the sink top.     guess i&#x27;ll look for a new brand</li>
    <li> I am sorry to have to say that this product is a flop. Bought on Feb 24, 2010... not working as of March 29, 2010. Thirty three (33)days! A complete waste of money. I have had a couple of other inter-plak water pics &amp; they lasted a fairly long time. This one has not performed well at all. It was said to be new but I have my doubts. The control nobs were difficult to turn, the water container is difficult to remove,and barely holds enough water. I am so disappointed, Don&#x27;t buy the one with the square water container.</li>
    <li> This machine is kind of small and light weight. Controls are tight and need both hands to handle it. Consider the cost of the machine, I can live with it. It works very well for me. I like it and use it at least twice a day.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brand due to positive reviews on Amazon.com.  They were right!  I love it!  Great pressure, it&#x27;s just what I expected.</li>
    <li> As an adult braces wearer this is the \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; product!! I travel a lot and it fits nicely in my small carry-on!  It sits on the counter in the bathroom and is unobtrusive! It has adjustable speeds -pressure- and it really does a nice job.. I do wish the tank was a little bigger..but I really can&#x27;t complain! a superior value for the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just an update! I&#x27;ve had this for a year and 1/2 &amp; it is still going strong I use it 3-4 times a day STILL..[[ASIN:B000F54AQA Interplak Dental Water Jet, 1 each]]</li>
    <li> Well pleased with the product. I got this one for my wife after having used one for several years. It has been reliable and my wife likes it. If this one lasts as long as the previous one it will be great The price is very good compared to the alternatives. I would definately buy one again.</li>
    <li> We have purchased many water piks over the years and decided to give this Interplak a try.  Very disappointed.  Resevoir does not hold enough water and is very difficult to take apart to rinse or fill.  Not enough power for irrigation.  Very noisy.  Just not as good a product as the \\&quot;Water Pik.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This product stopped working after only a few weeks.  I would not suggest a purchase</li>
    <li> I HATE flossing with string. I could never hold it correctly and was always nervous about it slipping too far down quickly and cutting my gums. I have never flossed in my life and my dentist always told me to do so. I finally got around to purchasing this water jet and I LOVE IT! It works great and leaves your mouth feeling refreshed and clean. I add a cupful of Listerene and fill the rest to the top with water. I have used it after eating ribs, corn, chicken wings, etc and it always removes the tiny pieces of food in between your teeth. Using this along with an electric toothbrush leave my mouth feeling clean and refreshed. It has a very powerful jet and is of good quality. Would definetely recommend to anyone who hates flossing!</li>
    <li> Had nothing but problems with this product.  Followed the instructions for getting the air out of the line but it still wouldn&#x27;t work properly.  Finally called Conair and they sent me a different model.  I don&#x27;t think they make this one anymore.  Maybe they were just out of it.  New one works fine.  Conair was great to deal with.  Actually got a real person when you dialed the customer service number.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  It has the appearance of being flimsy, but works better than my old one, which lasted for quite a few years.</li>
    <li> Purchased on 1-2-08 and used each day one time and on 1-9-08 sub-gingival tip failed.  Rubber tip split in two while using.  Phoned conair/interplak and got eternal hold.  After I finally got through they expected me to return the entire unit for replacement of the little attachment tip.  Not realistic.  I will return to Walmart for a full refund and look for another brand.  DO NOT BUY INTERPLAK BRAND!!!  When you have a problem (and you will because of poor quality) you will find no customer support that is reasonable.  They are rude and  don&#x27;t want you to return the unit and make doing so prohibitive in terms of the delay getting through and the cost of shipping back to them, the entire product no matter what goes wrong.  I&#x27;ve seen some poorly operated business&#x27; lately but this outfit takes the grand prize.  I would have given them no stars if it were possible.  The unit itself is very noisy, crude controls compared to other brands I&#x27;ve owned and has a very small reservoir.  The cord tangled so bad that it would surely have failed in short order if the tip hadn&#x27;t done so first.  I would recommend you spend the extra money on one of the better quality units out there rather than waste your money and time with this one (unless you are looking for a cheap gift and don&#x27;t care how it works).</li>
    <li> Pretty basic item, with several different attachments.  The cup holds a smaller amount of water than expected and I find I refill it before it runs out the first time in order to properly cleanse.  It does a good job.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this model wj6rw and the shipper. I didn&#x27;t want any batteries to have to replace. It would be nice if the water reservoir held a bit more water, but for most people using it at a lower setting, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s more than adequate. It was half the price of a water pik. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is great. I bought it for my boyfriend for Christmas. Was unable to find one locally and was happy to find it on Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Water flow out of the unit is a joke- dont waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> Overall this is a great product. Better than the 3 &#x27;Waterpik&#x27; oral irrigating appliances I bought before. The jet stream of liquid has more that enough power &amp; it is a smooth stream, not a pulsating action like the &#x27;Waterpik&#x27;. If I were to improve the product, I would make the on &amp; off switch easier to turn. It is a very attractive appliance and a great buy at just under $28.00, thanks to Amazon.</li>
    <li> If I could give this product less than one star I would. First, the base is too small and the unit tends to tip when the power switch is activated; I actually dumped a full reservoir of water onto the vanity top. Second, the hinged lid cannot be opened completely when the jet nozzle is in its holder. Since the lid stays open by being moved to the over-center position, mouthwash, baking soda, etc. cannot be added to the water without using two hands. Third, the jet nozzle consistently snags on the handle of the reservoir, and overall fouls more frequently. Fourth, the stopper in the bottom of the reservoir has no retaining device. That is, if the reservoir is turned upside-down, e.g. when pouring out unused water, the stopper will fall out. Fortunately, my stopper did not go down the drain. Losing this dime-sized piece of plastic will make the unit virtually useless. Finally, and I&#x27;ll admit this is subjective; the force of the jet does not seem as strong. It is one of the poorest jobs of engineering I&#x27;ve ever seen. It is almost as though no one ever actually used it during the design process.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the product for what it cost.  My only concerns, and they are huge concerns, are the reservoir and the button that is suppose to stop the water.  With the reservoir I find myself refilling 3 to 4 times.  With the button it requires very firm pressure for a extended period of time which tires out the fingers.  And when even if the button is pressed down all the way water still comes out the tip.  This is my first water jet purchase so I will wait until it breaks to purchase another.</li>
    <li> This little gem does everything it&#x27;s supposed to do.  It performs better than several Waterpik irrigators we have owned.  Nice water capacity in a nice, compact unit.  And, for the price, it&#x27;s an exceptional bargain.</li>
    <li> This is my second water jet. It is a very good product but this newer version has turn buttons instead of a push button to start. It is difficult to turn the small buttons when your fingers are wet. That is my only negative comment.Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Aloha from Hawaii ! Aside from the fact that this little machine has what I call \\&quot;minor flaws\\&quot;,(hey, what do you expect for the price, a mini-dentist?), when something went wrong (it suddenly stopped) after I had the machine over 2 years and did not remember where I bought it nor did I have the receipt, this company sent me an entirely \\&quot;brand new\\&quot; unit in a the original box-just like you get at the store. They gladly replaced it withoug any \\&quot;proof of purchase\\&quot; from me, as they could tell how long I had it and if it was still under warrenty up the serial number. Long warrenty too. On the very tiny down side, after using it daily for almost 8 years the white plastic hose cracked and broke into 2 pieces. But it works wonderful even with the so called \\&quot;cons\\&quot; that other reviewers stated. It is much cheaper than the Water Pik brands and works better in my opinion.</li>
    <li> The interplak is quite a bit smaller than my old water pic. It would be a lot easier to pack in a suit case if the water tank was designed to cover the motor portion. It also could use a little larger tank. The on off switch is very awkward. It should be larger so it can be used with wet hands. Over all I think it works quite well. The full power setting seems to be about the same as a setting of 6 on the water pic. Since that was the setting I was using on the water pic I have no problem with the lower power of the interplak. I think the smaller size in the suitcase and lower price make it a better deal than the water pic.</li>
    <li> This product was overall a good investment for me. It works fine for the price and it&#x27;s compact. I don&#x27;t like the fact that you have to keep the button pressed to stop the water flow. I think it should have worked the other way (press the button to get the water to come out). I like the product but I don&#x27;t use it often (no time). I would recommend it if you want something simple and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> good value, works well to get food particles out of gums but it is a little messy so keep a washcloth nearby to sop up water...and yes, the receptacle is poorly designed as it gets in the way of the wand.  Overall, a good product and a great price to maintain your teeth.</li>
    <li> Have had the product for over a month and it works great.  My only request is that they make the tank larger.</li>
    <li> Just received this product today and was assembling the lid (Reservoir cover) to the Reservoir of unit.  I thought it should be very easy to do, but with a little bit push to let the connection part of lid sliding into the hold part of Reservoir and one end connection on the lid broke.  Although it is made by plastic material, but should not be broken so easy.</li>
    <li> Product arrived very quickly. Every thing is working good. My only gripe is the unit has less power. If you want to fill the tank you have first remove the handle from the unit and put is aside. I have to use it will max speed/force setting for it to work normally for me. I used another model of this company before and it was very good. Dial setting at half mark it self used to be good enough. Not any more with this model. Not really met my expectation hence 3 star rating.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;m writing this, I just used household cement to hopoefully seal a crack in the water reservoir.  I discovered the crack after I had a river of water greet me on my bathroom&#x27;s counter space this AM.  The crack occurred because the reservoir is so darn hard to remove from the base for filling.  It&#x27;s tight --and as you hold the base and try to grab the slick reservoir, you try to gently rock it back and forth until free.  Apparently, I wasn&#x27;t gentle enough.  We&#x27;ll see if the cement seals the unit, but if not, that&#x27;s $25+ down the drain.    I hate water pik units with power cords that want to sit anywhere than where you want them.  The curly cord between the hand unit and base is equally determined to have its way.  I find both cords very inconvenient to use.  Then, when you are done with the unit, where do you put the darn thing?  It looks ugly with the cord wrapped around it.  I made a fabric cover to do the job.    And what stupid designer designed the hand unit so that you had to push its button to STOP water from squirting?  When you are half-asleep in the AM, you don&#x27;t think to push the button to stop water flow.  You generally wash your walls first before you remember to stick the thing in your mouth.    BTW, if you use essential oils like clove or peppermint in the water, the oils literally melt the plastic.  I learned to fill the reservoir first with water, then add my oils.    Don&#x27;t be dazzled by all the piks available on this unit.  The goal is to use water force to dislodge items between teeth, one pik does the job fine.    The force of water control is essential on any unit you buy, as well as the amount of water held in the reservoir.  If you like full force water with this size reservoir, you will have used all water within 5 seconds of use--causing you to stop and refill.  If you are a full force water fan, you may wish to consider units that connect to faucets, although the drawback on this is that you cannot add anything to the water as an added benefit in cleaning your mouth.  That being said, when done with the water pik, you can use special mouthwash for 30+ seconds in a cup and rinse your mouth the old-fashioned way, too.    If you are new to water piks, you may be wondering, are they really necessary?  Do you really want to do ALL THAT?  The answer is an absolute \\&quot;Yes.\\&quot;  Only after using the pik a few times and noting results obtained after weeks/months, will you realize what bad shape your mouth was in before.  Flossing and water pik use is essential to good oral hygiene.  Yes, it&#x27;s a pain to brush teeth and irrigate when you&#x27;re tired.  And you may think you have better things to do.  But after years of abuse, when you start developing dental problems, you quickly realize that you should have done better for your oral hygiene.      For the price, I&#x27;d say this unit was OK in comparison to others on the market.</li>
    <li> I have used this same water pic in the past .The last one one I bought locally at Wal-mart , it lasted a couple of years ,it lost its prime ,compressor would run but would not squirt water.This i Had in use a week &amp; the same thing happened .Itwont pickup &amp; squirt the water.Lyndel Wayne Long..wayne429@ecpi.com</li>
    <li> Yeah, yeah, I know. It&#x27;s been awhile since I have annotated a review here. Sorry.  Here we go.... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The WJ6R is a water jet designed to have wonderful  potential, but unfortunate stops way short of being a perfect oral hygiene device. I believe it has about 8 waterflow settings. And if it is power you seek, the WJ6 has plenty of it for you. That being said, I now present to you my humble pros and cons: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;PROS &lt;br /&gt;Power. Undoubtedly plenty of it. &lt;br /&gt;Reach. The length between the hand device and the base is more than enough. If you are 6-feet and plus, you can actually stand erect in the mirror while utilizing this apparatus. &lt;br /&gt;Compact. If you seek a water jet that consumes little space on your sink, this model is for you. &lt;br /&gt;Options. An inventive array of oral cleansing devices. They slip on the hand device easily but are sometimes a bit difficult to remove. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;CONS &lt;br /&gt;Lightweight. This machine is lacking in weight, even when filled with fluids. Either that or a different design needs to be implored on the bottom to prevent the base from moving too easily.  &lt;br /&gt;Fluid shut off. Now this is the the greatest con of this machine. You have a flow shut off on the handle. But gosh darn it, who in the heck in their infinite wisdom decided to create it so that you must hold the button IN in order to present fluid from jetting out! That needs to be reversed, for crying out loud. You should have to push a button on the handle to ALLOW fluid to flow. I do not know how many times when I turn the device on at the base, I forget to hold the handle button in. So I inadvertently create a waterflow mess during initial operation. &lt;br /&gt;Options holder. Inefficient! There are four places where you can rest your hygiene options. When they are on the machine, they are BARELY on it. Bump the machine, brush against the oral options, and they will easily dislodge from the base.  &lt;br /&gt;Fluid reservoir. I was expecting a much larger one.  As it is, the fluid holder gives you enough fluid for approximately TWO full rinsings. Then you must refill.  &lt;br /&gt;Hose placement. As it stands, it is incorrectly attached. Where the hold rests and where the hose inserts into the base gives you nothing but problems. I usually end up pulling the entire machine each time I place the hand device to my mouth. And when I return the hand device to its resting place, it doesn&#x27;t insert smoothly because the hose gets in the way. The hose should have been designed so that it inserts into the base more PROXIMAL to the hand device holder. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Before using this device for the first time, be certain you turn it on in order to let the settled air go through. Do this if you have not used the machine in awhile, as well. When I have read the other reviews on the various water jets before purchasing this one, it seems 8 out of 10 people are concerned with power. I have no idea as to why. It is not like you need a pressure hose to remove food particles between your teeth or under the inchoate gumline. Nonetheless, when I use the WJ6R, I am at the 6th setting and it is more than enough power. I have not tried it at the fullest strength.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I have nothing else to annotate. This machine definitely is a fine dental water jet. It executes its purpose flawlessly so far (1 month). Its major flaw does not rest with its purpose, it is inundated in its design. &lt;br /&gt;Forgive any types, etc. I am rushing this one through so at least you will have one review to read.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the waterpick purchased, like that it has a drawer underneath the unit to store extra picks.</li>
    <li> Now I&#x27;m wishing I would have listened to the other reviews before ordering this one. I only had this for two months before it quit working. Buying this product would be similar to flushing your money down the toilet.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000F54AQA Interplak Dental Water Jet, 1 each]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched the Internet for this particular brand of dental water jet. This is the second one we have had. It does a thorough job of cleaning around and between your teeth giving you better breath, less toothaches and saves trips to the dentist. My husband and I both use it daily and it has 4 attachments and holds more water than most others. Also the price is very reasonable. I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Works great does what it is suppose to</li>
    <li> Used the same one for the previous 4 years without any problem. So I decided to buy another one. The new one is working as well as a previous, so I satisfied completely.</li>
    <li> Purchased the Interplak Water Jet to replace a prior one that finally expired. One bad feature is the on/off switch.  It is too small and the design is such that with wet hands (you have just brushed your teeth!) it is very difficult to operate the on/off switch. It is obvious the designer never tried it.</li>
    <li> worked very well, as good as the latest water pics</li>
    <li> I had a waterpik which started having problems after a year (planned obsolescence, LA water...Who knows). I bought this hoping for better longevity but it is disappointing. I like the layout of the reservoir and controls but it is not nearly as powerful as the water pick and the reservoir is way to small. Just my opinion (humble as it may be)</li>
    <li> I stopped useing after buying a Waterpik WP-100 Ultra Dental Water Jet :):) &lt;br /&gt;conair makes junk !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using mine for about 5 years (pretty good longevity, I think) - anyway, I also have a Waterpik and use them both throughout the day depending on which bathroom is most convenient (I obviously cannot stand having anything between my teeth.)  The Waterpik is about 4 years old and ready for the trash (leaking tank seal, cracked, on/off button on handle sticks) - so, I&#x27;m replacing the Waterpik with another of these Interplak units.  It is a good buy, does a good job and comes at a good price.  By the way, my dentist recommends about a tablespoon of Listerine and a tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide in the tank each time you clean your mouth with these types of product.  The result is that I have flawless gums and I&#x27;m not exactly a spring chicken.</li>
    <li> This is the second WJ6RW unit that I have purchased.  The first one lasted around 4 years before the handle split.  This unit had great power and was used on the middle settings or slightly lower.  The second unit, just purchased, does not have 1/4 the power.  We have to operate it at the highest setting which is less power than the lowest setting of our original unit.  They are the same model number and look identical.  The power is usless even at the highest setting.</li>
    <li> This is my first water irrigating jet and was a Christmas gift. I&#x27;m kind of a tooth / oral hygiene snob, but had never even considered a water irrigating machine, so this is all new to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it a half-dozen times or so and this is my comments so far:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Plenty of pressure. I had to step it down about 50% when I was using this because it hurt.&lt;br /&gt;2. Good attachments. I particularly like the tongue scraper that comes with it.&lt;br /&gt;3. Decent value. Price is fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1. You have to hold the button on the handle for it to NOT spit out water. This is the dumbest user design I have seen in a while&lt;br /&gt;2. Cheap. There are more attachments than there are spots to hold them, and the holders for the various attachments don&#x27;t do a good job of securing the attachments&lt;br /&gt;3. Water reservoir too small. You will blow through a container of water way before you are finished with what you are doing here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I  like the unit OK. I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, so I don&#x27;t know if this is a good unit or not. It does the job, but has some minor annoyances.</li>
    <li> The price is cheap. However, the water speed is not good. I doubt whether it can help build healthier gums. It is soothing rather cleaning.</li>
    <li> This is my second Interplak dental irrigation device. The first one sprung a leak after 8 years! The new one seems to be much lighter and occasionally has some difficulty priming, but based on past performance I will struggle through till this one, too, shoots me in the eye...  DW</li>
    <li> I agree there are things to improve about this product. However, after using a couple other models over the years and reading reviews of other similar devices, I decided to give this item a strong four stars. For me the price, the power and the longevity (so far) have added up to a darn good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like: I like that there is a dial on the power setting, rather than a high/low only option. (And the strong massaging pressure feels very cleansing on my gums.) There is a flip top, so, when I&#x27;m not using the water jet, I can keep the reservoir in place, but dust doesn&#x27;t gather in the bowl. Although the machine is not tiny and does not seem to be built to take traveling, it is compact enough for my small countertop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The not so good: I wish the cord were better designed; I have to play a little detangle-and-unspin game when I finish using it. And what sounds to be a common theme of these devices is that the water reservoir isn&#x27;t large enough. To solve that, I fill a container with water and have it on stand-by to refill the reservoir rather than taking off the reservoir to fill in the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can tell, I&#x27;ve found rather minor negatives, but that&#x27;s not to say I anticipate the motor lasting forever because I have yet to encounter a waterpik or water jet these days that seems built to last. That&#x27;s the reason for the four rather than five stars -- products should be built to last rather than need to be replaced every few years and piled into a landfill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I think this water jet was a very good deal for my money.</li>
    <li> Love it, a must have for good dental hygiene.</li>
    <li> I got this for my son who just got his braces. After reading reviews I had mixed feelings about getting it. I&#x27;m glad I trusted my instincts and did.  This is GREAT. Perfect size to keep on sink or even pack in overnight bag.  Water is just perfect amount for 1 cleaning and honestly who would want to leave water standing in it and use stale water anyways? The spray goes from light to could take your skin off, LOL, so I would NOT suggest you use it on high unless you really need to get some major build-up off. Defiantly way easier than flossing and gives a fresh from the dentist clean feeling.  The only flaw I could find was that you have to hold the button in to get the water to stop, but after thinking about it that is really not a flaw.  It keeps you hands from getting tired or perfect for someone with arthritis.  If you want it to stop spaying just simply turn off at machine, or if want to stop for just a few seconds push the button on the handle.  Also doesn&#x27;t say it but comes with LOTS of different heads/tips. Again, PERFECT!</li>
    <li> I have one and after a while it stopped working (about a year).  Since it was broken anyway, I took it apart to see why it stopped working.  To my surprise, I found all the plastic parts inside had just crumbled apart into tiny sand/grit type pieces.  Not really worth the money if you have to replace it every year.</li>
    <li> This has been working well for me with daily use for several years, unlike my mom&#x27;s water piks which seem to need replacing right after the warranties expire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It always amazes me how clean your teeth feel after a brush/floss/irrigation.  I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Pros - Much quieter than other brands and a much more constant pressure.  Cons - The reservoir could be bigger.</li>
    <li> Its ok. lasted about a year before it finally quit completely. not overly impressed.</li>
    <li> It is durable, adjustable and reliable. The dental water jet does a great job cleaning my teeth and gum line.</li>
    <li> Use it all the time. Very happy with the product. I use to have one years ago and finally found another.</li>
    <li> Has held up, does a nice job of removing food debris; doesn&#x27;t take up much space on the countertop but water container does hold enough water that I usually do not need to refill it.</li>
    <li> I had a Waterpick that lasted over 10 years until the hose crumbled one day.  The pump, etc., is  working fine.  So, instead of buying the replacement hose, I decided to purchase this inexpensive model.  It worked fine for a while, but after a few months the pump lost all of its power.  It still runs, but I would be better off using a water fountain at a park.  Besides that and the small reservoir, which I expected, and the crow bar you need to detach the reservoir from the unit when you need to refill, it is fine.  I will never buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> Bought it at Target, so looked forward to using it. First attempt no water came out. Then suddenly started spewing water. Worked for 5 min then crapped out. The tips are very cheap and flimsy. This was model WJ7B. What a complete waste of time and money. This is what happens when you cheap out. Waterpic next for me. I would say avoid this so-called product like the plague.</li>
    <li> This a very flimsy unit with a a very hard switch to turn on. You have to hold the unit with one hand while attemting to turn on the switch. Not very friendly. The water storage resevoir does not come off the unit so that you can fill it under the sink, requiring aanother cup or glass to transport the water from the sink to the resovoir.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made, On and off switch hard to turn on. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> We have had this product before and bought it again, that is an endorsement right there.  Mouth wash, brushing and flossing first, then you wash out all the little areas that are difficult to reach. A good product at the right price.</li>
    <li> When my 20-year old Water Pik died, I just HAD to find a new one.  This one fits the bill just great.  I broke my jaw 9 years ago in 4 places.  Talk about the Bionic Woman!  This water jet helps me maintain my gums in good condition so that I am able to keep my teeth!  Even my dentist is very pleased with me!</li>
    <li> I dont think this one&#x27;s water force is as strong as the last one i purchased.  I had it for two years and dropped it on concrete and it broke.  Works Fine. Cheap.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be reliable, dependable and can say it adequately meets my needs, which was to prevent gum disease and mitigate for my failures to floss properly and frequently. It has all the features and attachments I need and I know that after the first month of use, I already feel a difference in my gums. This is the first water pick I use, and I am happy with it. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to buy it.</li>
    <li> Cheap alternative to the major brand.  Ok. Plastic is brittle.  Have had two of these break.  Replaced them with the major brand and I really prefer both the materials and design of the more expensive one. Best of all, it has not broken through 3 recent moves!</li>
    <li> Excellent!! Works well and cleans well.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve gone thru 3 of the WJ6RW water jets over the past 6 years or so.  The first one quit working just before the 2 year warranty expired. I only had to pay $3.00 (in 2007) to send the base unit back and get a new one.  The next two also quit working somewhere around the 2 years.  I didn&#x27;t follow up with any complaints and just went and spent the $30 for a new one.  The current one just quit about a week ago.  It still runs... it just doesn&#x27;t pump the water with enough pressure.  I tried running vinegar thru it thinking maybe there could be calcium build up.  No change. I do think they work well while they work. But hang on to your receipt and maybe the packaging!  I&#x27;m shopping for another new one - probably time to try something different.  Except we have all the attachments for this one.</li>
    <li> I am not as happy with the Interplak Dental Water Jet as I was with my waterpik.  The water jet is not as powerful as the waterpik&#x27;s.  I use it but I am not too satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is the third one I have owned.  The others lasted around 4-5 years each, which is pretty good considering the number of times a day I use it, and that I always have an approximately 10% solution of water and antiseptic (Listerine type) mouth wash solution in it.  I clean it from time to time but it is used.. a lot. I owned the water pic brand first (way back 30+yrs ago). The first one was great, but every one after that (I had bought 2 more) crapped out within a few months. That was when I found the Interplak.  This one is not as noisy as the others, and it seems to use a bit more water (I run full pressure), But I love it.  I hope it lasts the 4-5 yrs the others did and I will be completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It has a lot more attachments than most dental cleaners. If you are looking for one that is made for one or two people than this is great. A little small than i thought but holds enough liquid to do the job. Very easy to use and is great for traveling. A+</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this product. It has a weak spray, making it insuffient to really clean your teeth and gums. Also the reservoir does not hold enough water. I would NOT recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> Used daily.  I still have not used all the adapters....</li>
    <li> We received the product in a reasonable time, at a price we felt was reasonable.  It works well.  We had used this product before.  It was very convenient to purchase this at home.</li>
    <li> This thing is a joke, albeit very unfunny.  After getting tired of replacing my WaterPik every two years, I thought I&#x27;d try something else, so I bought the Interplak.  I&#x27;m returning it straightaway for the following reasons: 1)  The tip has a tendency to pop off with the slightest amount of backpressure, squirting water all over the place, 2) the reservoir is so small, one needs two fills just to complete a fairly quick irrigation of a full set of teeth, 3) the type of switch used makes it very inconvenient to switch it off, especially when the tip comes off and water is squirting all over, 4) the overall quality of materials and construction is so shoddy, I wouldn&#x27;t anticipate it lasting more than a few months.  The WaterPik and the Interplak together form a sad commentary on the inability of the U.S. to manufacture any consumer goods with any degree of quality or durability.  Anybody know of a good Japanese model?  Toyota? Honda? Yamaha?  Help!</li>
    <li> Have an Interplak Dental Water Jet in Florida where we spend the winter. However after several weeks in North Carolina, found  I really missed having it.  It cleans after flossing and its amazing how much is still on your teeth and gums that is flushed away.    This Jet is by far the best of the many I have tried in the past.</li>
    <li> Exactly what was expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a while now and can&#x27;t find anything wrong with it.  It comes with numerous tips, a holding compartment for the tips, and a powerful (adjustable) jet for excellent plaque removal.  My dentist was surprised at how little plaque I had at my cleaning following the purchase of this item.  I informed him that I had been using a \\&quot;water pick.\\&quot;  He told me to keep using it because my gums, and between my teeth, looked very good considering my penchant for sweets.  No complaints about this item.</li>
    <li> Super high power you can&#x27;t even max the dial all the way up because it will hurt and bleed your gum which is normal if you max it out, the dial adjustment is perfect you can adjust it in you preferred strength because it does not have the adjustment clicks, what I mean by that is, you can dial it slowly not like other jet mouth irrigators that has 3 or 4 settings only, this you can go little by little may be 3 1/4 or 1/2 or 3/4 and so on, and the tips are very cheap so I just bought 3 sets of tips for other family member which cost only $6 something and consist of 3 tips and 2 brushes per set.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately after waiting for it to arrived, the seller sent me a used one that is described as Brand new, the tip are dirty and the unit has full of scratches, so I just buy locally because my old one broke after 2 1/2 years of everyday use of 3 family members and I can&#x27;t sleep without this thing, you will be amazed that after you brushed your teeth, you may feel that all leftover food between your mouth is gone but it is not, try using this, you will see how many more food that this irrigator will take between your teeth which is amazing.&lt;br /&gt; I threw the one that the seller sent me because I don&#x27;t know who used it and I don&#x27;t want to gamble my heath and get sick by using that one, anyway I contacted the seller and he apologized and refunded me without any argument which is very nice, everyone make mistakes so it is okay.&lt;br /&gt; Buy this thing, you will save in the long run compare to buying floss, and flossing if done inproperly can abraised the side of your tooth, this one, just used water and put some mouthwash on it, perfect machine that every house should have IMHO.</li>
    <li> I purchased my first one of these back in the early 1990&#x27;s and it just finally wore out this past year. It took a long time to find this exact model and I&#x27;m glad I kept searching. Yes, it&#x27;s a little noisy, but it is compact, does the job and I don&#x27;t find it cumbersome at all. I&#x27;d feel comfortable recommending it to anyone looking for this type of product.</li>
    <li> I just purchased my Interplak about one month ago.  At the first use, I wondered why I always have to be the sucker.  Is it written in my DNA code?  Is it some mental defect?  I decided that I might do some research just as soon as I cleaned the water from all over the bathroom sink.  It sprayed water all over the place (even wet up my toilet paper), and the spray felt far too weak to be of any benefit.  As I boxed up the unit to return, I wondered about the other tips and whether or not turning up the pressure would do any good.  So, I unboxed that rascal, filled it up, changed to the sub-gingival tip, and let &#x27;er rip.  Whoa!  What a change!  That tip on the highest setting really does the trick.  It even blasted away that wicked popcorn husk that had settled under my gum line and had been vexing me since dinner.  I have since decided that using the subgingival tip on the highest setting is overkill.  The pressure is strong enough to leave my gums too sensitive, so I have turned it down a couple of notches.  That tip works so well that I no longer bother with the other tips that were included.  And it is just as well too, since the tongue cleaner tool is likely a hospital visit just waiting to happen.  I almost drowned in front of the mirror when I tried it.  There is no good way to holler for help with a pint of water down your  throat.  I caution strongly against that.      Overall, the unit is a great machine at a great price.  I agree with one of the reviewers about storing the other attachments on the machine.  The least little bump or jarring sends them all over the floor or sink top.  I keep mine stored in a baggie for the day when I develop amnesia and forget why I never use them.  Also, I have to use my Interplak without that water stopper in the resevoir now, or it won&#x27;t work.  I just fill it with a dixie cup or something, and I am off to the races.  I do wish that the resevoir held more water at times.  It has to be refilled at least once to finish the job, but I shouldn&#x27;t complain.  I bought it because I didn&#x27;t want a big butt-ugly tank littering the bathroom.  Next time (when this Interplak breaks totally), I&#x27;ll get the Quickpik to attach to the faucet.</li>
    <li> We replaced an old Interplak Dental Water Jet with this new one after the old one developed a leak in the hose.   The new one has the same model number but is lighter and quieter than the old one (has a different motor). It works very well.  We are pleased with this new model.</li>
    <li> I am not English sorry for my language , However    this is a good deal..  but..there are a few cons    this machin spends water really quickly....  I have to refill water frequently.  and makes much noise..  other than this it ok</li>
    <li> At the ripe old age of 54, I have braces. The Orthodontist recommended oral irrigation as superior to laborious flossing around the braces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a guy prone to do a lot of research prior to purchasing anything, I did the whole research thing and found that all oral irrigation machines, no matter from what company (WaterPik, ViaJet, Interplak, whomever) all have lots of negative reviews. It seems they are all prone to leaking, breaking, tipping over and a host of other issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That  being the case, I decided to start at the low end of the pricing scale and see if the cheaper machine with pretty good ratings would work for me. So I bought the Conair Interplak WJ64.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it is cheesy feeling...very cheap in its construction. It is also very light weight, particularly the base. When attempting to remove the reservoir, the base usually comes up off the counter right along with the reservoir so it takes two hands to remove it...one hand holding the base, the other grabbing and lifting the reservoir. This is not that big of a deal, but it is indicative of the lightness of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reservoir is just the right size for a single rinsing of the mouth but the small size does make the overall \\&quot;footprint\\&quot; of the unit small too. That is a good thing as it does not take up a lot of space on the bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the tip holders on the unit...forget it. The tips easily fall out ending up on the counter/floor. Stash the un-used tips in a drawer and save yourself the daily frustration. I only use the standard tip and suspect most people would do the same. For my usage, the other tips don&#x27;t serve much purpose as I also use an electric toothbrush and don&#x27;t need to use the other tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pressure from this machine is totally sufficient. I have settled on a pressure setting in the mid-range of the possible settings and at that setting the stream is quite strong. No issues with pressure (or lack of) for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like the \\&quot;on/off\\&quot; button on the handle... it is really cheeesy feeling and I&#x27;m just waiting for it to break. It hasn&#x27;t yet, but then again, I&#x27;ve only been using the machine for two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price I paid, nearly half the cost of other oral irrigation machines, I&#x27;m quite happy so far. It does have a 2 year warranty which I consider generous. So if it breaks, the warranty should cover it. If it doesn&#x27;t break in two years then it&#x27;ll be one heck of a value because I like its performance in spite of the limitations I&#x27;ve already mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to by a Waterpik initially, but after reading so many complaints about how the quality of them has gone downhill, I decided to try this one first. I&#x27;m happy with my decision. I will update my review if anything changes my opinion such as breakage or leaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was tempted to give only 3 stars because of the \\&quot;cheesy\\&quot; factor, but am going out on a limb and awarding 4 stars since the performance of the machine has been more than adequate so far and the price is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: April 29, 2009&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Interplak Water Jet daily for 8 months. It has not leaked or broken down. Still going strong and I&#x27;d have to say it has certainly paid for itself at this point. My dentist is happy with the health of my gums and says I couldn&#x27;t be doing a better job keeping things clean. That&#x27;s good enough for me. I had to take a trip a few weeks ago and was without my water jet, and I really missed it. It&#x27;s a great and reasonably priced device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: December 8, 2009&lt;br /&gt;Well, it&#x27;s going on 18 months and the Interplak is still performing flawlessly. There has been no issues with this little thing at all. It has proven to be a fantastic bargain given it&#x27;s performance. If you are looking for what is possibly the best value in oral irrigation machines, I&#x27;d have to say that this is the winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Nov 14, 2010&lt;br /&gt;After 2 years of braces,I&#x27;m happy to say they are finally off my teeth as of about 3 weeks ago. I&#x27;m still using the Interplak Dental Water Jet and it&#x27;s still chugging away. I do have one developing issue with it however. Several months ago I started noticing a small amount of water underneath the unit after usage. At first I thought it was just some water dripping because of spillage of the water reservoir. But I now think that someting is leaking inside and finding its way out through the bottom somewhere. The unit still works but it just has a bit of water, probably a teaspoon or two after each use. I have not taken it apart to see if its something that can be easily remedied or not. I&#x27;m not too worried about it because if it can&#x27;t be fixed, it&#x27;s not that big of a deal and I&#x27;ll continue to use it until it croaks. I&#x27;ve gotten two years plus of using it at least 2-times per day so if I need to buy another oral irrigation device to replace this, I&#x27;ll likely buy the same thing again as it has worked so well and was so fairly priced. And my dental hygienist continues to praise me during my twice yearly exams. This has completely replaced flossing for me and I still get high marks from my dentist. I attribute that entirely to the Interplak Water Jet and brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Sep 17, 2011&lt;br /&gt;Sad to say that the journey has ended with my original Interplak Dental Water Jet. Over the last few weeks I had been getting increasing amounts of water leaking from the  handle. It seems that the rubber gasket that holds the tip in place when inserted into the handle just isn&#x27;t able to retain a tight grip on the tip thus allowing water to seep out when in use. Well, the seeping turned to more or less gushing and I&#x27;ve just had to conclude that it&#x27;s over for this unit. It lasted just shy of 4 years and had daily use. I&#x27;m happy with that and am actually going to the Big Box store to buy another. And of course, I&#x27;ll update my review with all the juicy details of how my replacement unit performs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINAL UPDATE: Oct 3, 2011&lt;br /&gt;I went to my Big Box store and they no longer carried the Interplak Dental Water Jet. So I came back to Amazon, did some further research and decided upon the [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]] which was about $10 more than the Interplak but actually had some decent review. I must admit that I am quite happy with it, perhaps even happier than I was with the Interplak for several reasons. I do plan on reviewing the WaterPik Ultra but you&#x27;ll have to check on that page for the review. Thanks Interplak, it was a good journey. I just hope that WaterPik lasts as long as you did.ng away. I do have one developing issue with it however.

    <li> I have no problems with my waterpix it works just as I had expected it to do.  Very good buy for the money.</li>
    <li> i purchased this item a few years ago and haven&#x27;t used it very much.  always intended to, did for a while, then stopped, and now am using it again.  it has always worked the same.  i admit that it is a little awkward, seems crammed together, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, and it doesn&#x27;t seem too light as it has to other reviewers.  it never tries to tip over.  i use the medium setting.  for someone like myself who hasn&#x27;t used pulsing water on my gums for a long time, it is important to start slowly, and even then, i will probably NEVER use the machine at its highest setting, so long as it maintains its power as it is now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have been adding ceylon cinnamon essential oil to the water and am getting great results.  didn&#x27;t have gum disease to contend with and no plaque to speak of, but it has been probably 30 years since my teeth have been cleaned by a dental hygienist.  have had two cavities in that time.  the dentist freaks that my teeth haven&#x27;t been cleaned, so i ask, is there a lot of plaque on them?, and he says, \\&quot;that isn&#x27;t the point!\\&quot;  because of not going to the dentist for cleanings, i decided to start using the interplak machine again and to add the cinnamon oil because it won&#x27;t allow bacteria to build up in the hose or for that matter, in my gums, should kill any infection it runs across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to me, the machine seems good.  the one missing star is for its awkward construction, but maybe that is the price one pays for compactness.  about the size of the reservoir, if the setting is on medium, it takes a while for the water to run through the machine.  just as people can and do brush their teeth and gums away, they can also really hurt their gums with pulsing water that is too strong.</li>
    <li> Been using this regularly for over a year now, and it has been great. The pressure settings go from a drizzle to &amp;#34;fire hose to the face&amp;#34;, so generally only have it set barely half way. It comes with a few different shaped tips, which I didn&#x27;t find particularly useful - the basic nozzle does the job just fine. The tank can be a little tough to pull off the base for filling, it could benefit from having some way to secure it down, or maybe even just an easier way to hold on to the base while pulling the tank off. For my needs, the tank is just large enough for a single thorough use.</li>
    <li> This is the second one we own.  It is not easy to find one.  I believe it is discontinued or some sort.  If you find one the price gets bumped up 3-4 times.&lt;br /&gt;It has a very strong stream to flush out any particles between your teeth.  Interplak should make more for consumers.  I do not know what is the problem.</li>
    <li> It blows crap out between your teeth. What more is there to say? Could be a little more sturdy but worth the price.</li>
    <li> I really am pleased with the performance of this water-pik. My teeth are important to me so I consider this an investment in beauty to keep my smile healthy and pleasing!</li>
    <li> the water container seemed a bit small so you have to put an extra glass of water in 1/2 way through the process.  price was good though.</li>
    <li> did I say how compact it is.  I have been using various Waterpik devices for almost 50 years.  this is the most clean compact design I have seen yet.  I have had this 1 for about 10 years now.  I think I paid about 20 dollars for it.  I have had several expensive water pics over the years, but none of them have lasted this long.  I don&#x27;t change the pics.  that tends to make all of them fail.  no matter how expensive they are.  I use an 8 ounce cup to fill the reservoir.  removing the reservoir tends to make them all leak.  save your gums and use the middle pressure setting.</li>
    <li> This is an exact(?) replacement for one that broke.  However, it is much lighter than the broken one, which is OK.  The motor has held up now for over a year.</li>
</ol>
