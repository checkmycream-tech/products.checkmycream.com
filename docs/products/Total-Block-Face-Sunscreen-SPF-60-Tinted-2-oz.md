      <li>That makes the value of this product incredible.</li>
      <li>This is cost effective and is a marvelous sunscreen.</li>
      <li>NOT FOR LIGHT SKIN!!!</li>
      <li>I love it!!</li>
      <li>Being able to change the tint myself is awesome throughout the year as my skin tone varies</li>
      <li>product comes in good time</li>
      <li>It gives good coverage, foundation wise also.</li>
      <li>The color was perfect, the coverage is fantastic, and it looks good all day.</li>
      <li>It is a good block with zinc and has a nice matte finish.</li>
      <li>it is the best sunscreen I have used for the skin issues I have with a very high SPF&lt;br</li>
      <li>For someone who wants to streamline his/her sunscreen and medium to full coverage foundation routine, this is an excellent product!</li>
      <li>This is such a great product!  </li>
      <li>Fallene Total Block tinted not only provides the best protection from the sun for my hyperpigmentation, but also is the perfect cover up.  </li>
      <li>Best solution for that was to switch back to the moisturizer it worked with.</li>
      <li>It more closely resembles clown paint than sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>Gives a nice smooth finish to my complexion.</li>
      <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
      <li>I have lots of hyper-pigmentation from longtime acne, and this is the best option I&#x27;ve found to get the benefits of a medium to full coverage foundation without exacerbating existing breakouts or causing new ones.</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply and you can tint it to suit your skin color.</li>
      <li>It does not break out her skin; it washed off easily at the end of the day.</li>
      <li>This is as light as it gets.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic product that has lasted for years.</li>
      <li>The difference is the &amp;#34;FACE&amp;#34; kind is tintable, comes with a tube of &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; and a tube of &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; to lighten or darken the main bottle of sunblock.</li>
      <li>Total block is more of a liquid (like a foundation) and comes in a bottle more like a sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>Total Block is a great product, but if you are very fair (as I suspect a majority of high SPF sunscreen wearers are), this is MUCH too dark.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s actually the best foundation I have, as it offers complete coverage without looking cakey.</li>
      <li>product offers great coverage without looking caked-on, and so much easier to deal with than putting on clear sunscreen and make-up separately.</li>
      <li>Overall, she is extremely pleased with the block and will continue to use it.</li>
      <li>Furthermore, it&#x27;s also much cheaper than foundations from fancy beauty or department stores!</li>
      <li>I LOVE Total Block.</li>
      <li>My (naked) face is always very light  compared to my body during the summer because of how well this product protects from the sun ( I allow the rest of my body to tan for health and aesthetic reasons )  - highly recommended!</li>
      <li>It looks very natural, lasts all day and offers fantastic protection.</li>
      <li>Originally could only be purchased through my dermatologist for a much higher price.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping</li>
      <li>The 60 SPF really saves my skin in the FL sunshine.</li>
      <li>It also settles in wrinkles, so while getting ready in the morning you have to massage it out of the wrinkles a couple of times as it sets.  </li>
      <li>After some research and the fantastic reviews here, she decided to try Total Block.</li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s the good part: when I tried it at first it was too dark (and I added the whole tube of white!!)</li>
      <li>but you have to consider the ingredients really do block the sun.  </li>
      <li>In photo, the cap on right contains regular &amp;#34;Total Block&amp;#34; (the non-tintable kind, just comes this pale pinkish color...which happens to be an exact match for my skin).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not very moisturizing, but it gives fantastic coverage for how lightweight it is.</li>
      <li>I love that it is tinted because now I use this as my everyday foundation.  </li>
      <li>Is dry and last all day, I love it.</li>
      <li>You can use the dark tint for summer and light tint for winter.  </li>
      <li>The only problem I ever had with it was that it wouldn&#x27;t apply well over certain moisturizers.</li>
      <li>Total block is somewhat difficult to apply and the color isn&#x27;t great.</li>
      <li>I use it daily and it really protects my face from sunburn all day, every day.  </li>
      <li>She wanted something that would not break out her skin; that had sufficient protection that she would not end up with more dark spots (that she is always struggling to get rid up and keep from starting) and had enough color that she does not need to put a foundation over.  </li>
      <li>I added the ENTIRE TUBE of &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; and still ended up WAY to dark for my light skin.</li>
      <li>But, I emailed the company, and within 15 hours they responded- offering me an extra white control tube (for free this time to see how it works for me) and informing me of my options to buy the extra white in the future.</li>
      <li>The only reason I don&#x27;t use it on a daily basis year-round is that it contains some ingredients that can&#x27;t be classified as natural.</li>
      <li>My wife was a little concerned when it first went on.  </li>
      <li>The bottle looks the same except for the word &amp;#34;FACE,&amp;#34; which is hard to notice in the photo, and didn&#x27;t read the whole description -- the distinction isn&#x27;t that clear on the webpage.</li>

<li> This lasts a long time!  </li>
<li> I have hyperpigmentation on my face as well as some red areas due to Lupus.  </li>
<li> The extra tube of white will cost less than a dollar!</li>

<li> Total Block Tinted Sunscreen is just the product for me that has rosacea issues, dark spots, etc.</li>
<li> It does feel a little thick at first</li>

<li> It comes with two tubes, one to make the color lighter; one to make it darker, that you add if the color is not right for you.  </li>

<li> It is just too dark for her skin (and her skin is already olive).  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a year now</li>
<li> I was a little bummed.</li>
<li> and I use it everyday.  </li>
<li> What a waste of my money.</li>
<li> Cannot even use this, just wasted $20.</li>
<li> It requires another dish to mix and so a lot is wasted.</li>
<li> It appeared a little dark and rather thick.</li>
<li> If I was that dark, I wouldn&#x27;t be wearing SPF60 sunblock!!!</li>
<li> I use the tinted foundation and have used it for at least 8 years.</li>
<li> The problem is that the base color is very dark.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used very expensive of all sorts.</li>
<li> it cover up the ugly discoloration on my skin</li>
<li> I am disappointed with this product.  </li>
<li> I am 27 with terrible hyperpigmentation/malasma and this sunscreen had helped significantly.&lt;br</li>
<li> Looks terrible over damaged skin, rather than hiding it.</li>

    <li> I have used this product for over 10 years and just found it on amazon. Originally could only be purchased through my dermatologist for a much higher price. I use it daily and it really protects my face from sunburn all day, every day.  The only problem I ever had with it was that it wouldn&#x27;t apply well over certain moisturizers. Best solution for that was to switch back to the moisturizer it worked with. Tubes of color are included to adjust the color of the tint. Gives a nice smooth finish to my complexion.</li>
    <li> Is dry and last all day, I love it.</li>
    <li> For someone who wants to streamline his/her sunscreen and medium to full coverage foundation routine, this is an excellent product!

    <li> Adapts to any skin color.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!!!! I love it!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this sunscreen for years.  It is easy to apply and you can tint it to suit your skin color.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen on the market</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a year now and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  I purchased it to hide and prevent unsightly melasma on my face.  I love that it is tinted because now I use this as my everyday foundation.  A bottle will last me about six months and I use it everyday.  I just purchased my third bottle.  I hope they never stop making this tinted version!</li>
    <li> Protects my face from the sun.  It gives good coverage, foundation wise also.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Fast shipping</li>
    <li> This is the best makeup ever.I&#x27;ve used very expensive of all sorts. This is cost effective and is a marvelous sunscreen. Being able to change the tint myself is awesome throughout the year as my skin tone varies</li>
    <li> My wife uses Tizo3, which was recommended by her dermatologist.  It is a good block with zinc and has a nice matte finish. The only problem?  It is just too dark for her skin (and her skin is already olive).  It may just not be the block for her.  She wanted something that would not break out her skin; that had sufficient protection that she would not end up with more dark spots (that she is always struggling to get rid up and keep from starting) and had enough color that she does not need to put a foundation over.  She is 53.  After some research and the fantastic reviews here, she decided to try Total Block. Total block is more of a liquid (like a foundation) and comes in a bottle more like a sunscreen.  The 2 ounce is a generous size.  It comes with two tubes, one to make the color lighter; one to make it darker, that you add if the color is not right for you.  Brilliant!  My wife was a little concerned when it first went on.  It appeared a little dark and rather thick. It also settles in wrinkles, so while getting ready in the morning you have to massage it out of the wrinkles a couple of times as it sets.  But then, perfection!  The color was perfect, the coverage is fantastic, and it looks good all day. It does not break out her skin; it washed off easily at the end of the day. Overall, she is extremely pleased with the block and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product!  I have hyperpigmentation on my face as well as some red areas due to Lupus.  Fallene Total Block tinted not only provides the best protection from the sun for my hyperpigmentation, but also is the perfect cover up.  I basically use it as a foundation.  It covers the dark spots, red areas and any other blemishes.  It is truly an amazing product!!</li>
    <li> Total block is somewhat difficult to apply and the color isn&#x27;t great.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product that has lasted for years. It&#x27;s actually the best foundation I have, as it offers complete coverage without looking cakey.

It looks very natural, lasts all day and offers fantastic protection. My (naked) face is always very light  compared to my body during the summer because of how well this product protects from the sun ( I allow the rest of my body to tan for health and aesthetic reasons )  - highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I am 27 with terrible hyperpigmentation/malasma and this sunscreen had helped significantly.&lt;br /&gt;- it cover up the ugly discoloration on my skin&lt;br /&gt;- I can tint it to whichever skin tone I have&lt;br /&gt;- it isn&#x27;t to greasy&lt;br /&gt;- it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts&lt;br /&gt;- it is the best sunscreen I have used for the skin issues I have with a very high SPF&lt;br /&gt;- product comes in good time</li>
    <li> NOT FOR LIGHT SKIN!!! I LOVE Total Block. Please note this is Total Block FACE. I hit the &amp;#34;order again&amp;#34; button on my order history that showed Total Block, and this came up. The bottle looks the same except for the word &amp;#34;FACE,&amp;#34; which is hard to notice in the photo, and didn&#x27;t read the whole description -- the distinction isn&#x27;t that clear on the webpage. The difference is the &amp;#34;FACE&amp;#34; kind is tintable, comes with a tube of &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; and a tube of &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; to lighten or darken the main bottle of sunblock. The problem is that the base color is very dark. I added the ENTIRE TUBE of &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; and still ended up WAY to dark for my light skin. In photo, the cap on right contains regular &amp;#34;Total Block&amp;#34; (the non-tintable kind, just comes this pale pinkish color...which happens to be an exact match for my skin). The cap on the left contains &amp;#34;Total Block FACE&amp;#34; -- AFTER adding the entire tube of lightening cream. This is as light as it gets. If I was that dark, I wouldn&#x27;t be wearing SPF60 sunblock!!! Cannot even use this, just wasted $20. Total Block is a great product, but if you are very fair (as I suspect a majority of high SPF sunscreen wearers are), this is MUCH too dark.</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with the product, but mostly, I&#x27;m impressed with the company! It was recommended to me by my (I don&#x27;t know the official title, but she&#x27;s a lady who does facials!)&lt;br /&gt;This product offers great coverage without looking caked-on, and so much easier to deal with than putting on clear sunscreen and make-up separately. Here&#x27;s the good part: when I tried it at first it was too dark (and I added the whole tube of white!!) I was a little bummed. But, I emailed the company, and within 15 hours they responded- offering me an extra white control tube (for free this time to see how it works for me) and informing me of my options to buy the extra white in the future. The extra tube of white will cost less than a dollar! That makes the value of this product incredible.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed with this product.  It more closely resembles clown paint than sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;And, it beads up strangely on your skin when you sweat, which we do a lot of in South Carolina!</li>
    <li> This is all I will use on my face!  The 60 SPF really saves my skin in the FL sunshine.I use the tinted foundation and have used it for at least 8 years. It is the best!</li>
    <li> Always the same. Great makeup coverage and protection plus color additive to customize your color!</li>
    <li> I am Caucasian and like a dark tan in the summer but I am very white in the winter. This can be used in place of liquid foundation.  It does feel a little thick at first but you have to consider the ingredients really do block the sun.  You can use the dark tint for summer and light tint for winter.  This lasts a long time!  I bought one for last year and then bought another for this year.</li>
    <li> my wife uses this every time she goes out, to protect her face..</li>
    <li> No space within to mix color. It requires another dish to mix and so a lot is wasted. Looks terrible over damaged skin, rather than hiding it. What a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> Total Block Tinted Sunscreen is just the product for me that has rosacea issues, dark spots, etc.</li>
