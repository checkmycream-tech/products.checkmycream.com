      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several of these grooming devices for men, and this is the best one that I&#x27;ve found.  </li>

      <li>Battery life is amazing, the product is hands down the best product i have ever bought!!</li>

      <li>Norelco is the best trimmers I&#x27;ve ever used hand down. :)</li>
      <li>Easy to hold and maneuver.</li>
      <li>The instructions are easy to read.  </li>
      <li>Easy to switch out attachments.</li>

      <li>Really easy to use.</li>
      <li>I just used it this morning, and the battery is still going strong.</li>
      <li>but right now it does an awesome job and gets closer than I ever thought possible.</li>
      <li>but if you charge it before use every time, you should be fine.</li>
      <li>He says that it is very easy to use, and he is very pleased with the final results, and so am I.</li>
      <li>ok , the shaver cuts hair real fast almost feels like a blade razor...</li>
      <li>Great design and battery seems to last forever before it needs a charge.</li>
      <li>I replaced the blade only once, and have nothing but great things to say about this product.  </li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and works quickly without pain.  </li>
      <li>This is the best quality shaver, and I can&#x27;t imagine I went with straight blade razors for so long.  </li>
      <li>You can even trim arm and leg hair very fast and neatly with the attachments-no more sketchy undercarriage/nut trimming with scissors.</li>
      <li>i think its worth 40 dollars go for it!</li>
      <li>to clean, requires virtually zero maintenance</li>
      <li>It has more power than the last one and the different attachments are very good.</li>
      <li>a body full of Nicks and Cuts.</li>
      <li>It has just the right attachments to make me smooth from head to toe...</li>
      <li>The shaver works great for shaving chest and other areas.</li>
      <li>this new design dose not seem to cut as close as the original one  but its ok</li>
      <li>Quick and efficient, it makes body grooming a snap.</li>
      <li>I highly suggest the bodygroom whether for grooming your beard or even the more &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; areas.</li>
      <li>The new version is sleeker and has a better array of attachments.  </li>
      <li>The kit fits within the stand which is great; it takes up less space.</li>
      <li>The product is a great improvement over the previous model.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a quick &amp; easy way to trim body hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried to cut myself and haven&#x27;t even brought blood with it in the most sensitive places.</li>
      <li>Useful and reliable.</li>
      <li>I shaved a lot without water, it shaves nice this way, then I went to find out what was left by rinsing off</li>
      <li>I was tempted to use right away when I received it</li>
      <li>I am a pretty hairy guy, and the attachments are easy to use, and it works great for your back, and other body hair with the adjustable trimmer.</li>
      <li>Exceptional customer service, other companies could learn a lesson from Norelco/Philips.</li>
      <li>Good build quality, long battery lie, easy to clean, and can even get wet.</li>
      <li>I used the attachments at various heights in various areas and was happy with the results everywhere.</li>
      <li>I had the older version of this product and liked it until the built-in battery finally died, so I thought I would stay with Philips.  </li>
      <li>This thing even had my upper thighs or bikini/speedo line bleeding,and that&#x27;s relatively smooth anyway!</li>
      <li>Okay, I returned this the same day I received it.  </li>
      <li>Make sure the foil is the only thing that contacts the skin.</li>
      <li>Versatile with many attachments for different lengths of hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am not sure its worth its price, yet at least.... Probably you can get similar qualities with cheaper trimmers</li>
    <li> I had the older version of this and the battery finally died after 5 years. This model is perfect for me. It works great! The next model up is more than I need.</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but totally worth it.  This is the best quality shaver, and I can&#x27;t imagine I went with straight blade razors for so long.  Good build quality, long battery lie, easy to clean, and can even get wet.</li>
    <li> The instructions are easy to read.  And it only takes a couple of uses to get the hang of it.  Quick and efficient, it makes body grooming a snap.</li>
    <li> I had the old model for 2 years. The battery finally went. I would highly recommend this to any man. I am a pretty hairy guy, and the attachments are easy to use, and it works great for your back, and other body hair with the adjustable trimmer. Seriously, I did my research but don&#x27;t second guess. Just get this one. The next model up is too complicated.</li>
    <li> I spent too long grooming body hair with the flip-up attachment to my electric razor. This makes life much easier and completely painless. The attachments are great so you don&#x27;t have to shave completely if you still want a more natural look.</li>
    <li> It does what it says, i tried the large trimmer in my legs first before to cut down some hair (i am very hairy) it works bah ok , the shaver cuts hair real fast almost feels like a blade razor... Hurts sometimes, theres certain areas i will still use my match 3, mayve is just me beacuse im a hairy guy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cuts a lot of hair in no time faster than my old one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels like a razor blade although its faster and safer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;nice accesories even thought i dont use them that often&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After i used i didnt have irritation at all on my legs or tights&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;easy cleaning thats what i like the most about this bodygrommer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is loud! and shakes quite a lot so hold it tight when your using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wet it sucks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its hard to reach some spots, and hurts sometimes so becarefull&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most bodygrommers come with a carrying bag which i like it this model will give you the chargin stand and clippers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall i think its worth 40 dollars go for it!</li>
    <li> I was tempted to use right away when I received it but I did listen to the direction and waited for it to charge 8 hours.This unit is just incredible! The trimmer for chest and other large areas leaves a little to be desired on thick hair,but the shaver and close trimmer works great even in the most tender of places it shaves so clean and smooth you will be glad and so will your partner.</li>
    <li> not as good as the original product which they dont sell anymore i had to go to ebay to get it this new design dose not seem to cut as close as the original one  but its ok</li>
    <li> I have to disagree with the other reviewers. My experience with this&lt;br /&gt;is a body full of Nicks and Cuts. As a matter of fact it really didnt&lt;br /&gt;cut \\&quot;any\\&quot; hair properly. Maybe this one was defective. Regardless,&lt;br /&gt;its on its way back for a refund. Have to look for something else that&lt;br /&gt;doesnt chop you up.</li>
    <li> I think Philips Norelco BodyGroom Plus is one of the trimmers on the market. I have tried others, but they were not as easy and safe to use as the BodyGroom Plus.</li>
    <li> Okay, I returned this the same day I received it.  I&#x27;ve been using a razor for quite a while, let my hair grow out again and took this to it.  It works great for the most part, and I didn&#x27;t have much experience with it but it was a pain to use from what I got out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your wet it is really hard to use.  If your dry, and you have long hair, it&#x27;s going to clump up making it nearly impossible to determine what has been shaved off and what is still there.  So it&#x27;s a dilemma, isn&#x27;t it?  I shaved a lot without water, it shaves nice this way, then I went to find out what was left by rinsing off and it&#x27;s great shaving was reduced to poor.  But I&#x27;m not sure what I expected with hair flush with the skin, for the price I thought it must work miracles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s back to using a standard razor- something that&#x27;ll shave me to the skin wet and I can tell where I&#x27;ve shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of good reviews, maybe I&#x27;m weird.</li>
    <li> So, you need a razor of sorts? Yeah this&#x27;ll do.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not really that into this type of thing that I can reference all these different brands and models and such, but this does completely as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has fantastic battery life, attachments make each bit it&#x27;s for easier to use, and I&#x27;ve yet to have any problems with it since it was purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also as a note, it is indeed water-proof. Shouldn&#x27;t have to say that but you&#x27;d be surprised...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good purchase! The Price-to-Quality-ratio is just Terrific! Ajustable groomer are working and the shaving blade doesn&#x27;t irritate me.</li>
    <li> We ordered this in March and its working great till date. The blades are of good quality and gives smooth finish without cutting the skin. The battery life is good when fully recharged.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband. He is very happy and loves it a lot. He says that it is very easy to use, and he is very pleased with the final results, and so am I.</li>
    <li> both my husband and i use it, i have very sensitive skin and can not use a bic on my legs, i use this, works great</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy any other brand, I tried. It performs well and has good battery life. Also causes minimal damage to the nether regions.</li>
    <li> Probably the best body groomer I have used to date.</li>
    <li> I had the older version of this product and liked it until the built-in battery finally died, so I thought I would stay with Philips.  I am not sorry I did.  The new version is sleeker and has a better array of attachments.  It is easy to use and holds a charge for a very long time.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a quick &amp; easy way to trim body hair.</li>
    <li> The BG2030 is great!!! If you shave your body this is the product for you. You will not cut yourself and you can can pretty much get as close as a razor.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product.  Phillips sure knows what a man needs!!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my older model which I dropped and damaged.  This is a step up from the basic model as it has different, interchangable heads.  As other reviewers note, you have to give it a full eight hour charge, and it does charge more slowly on repeated charges than, say, a standard Norelco shaver. For things like chest hair, you can adjust the blade cover for the length of hair you want.  It takes repeated swipes, but it gets the job done.  For areas where it seems you have to be euphemistic, I use no guard on the blade for a close shave.  The key is to hold it lightly and flat against the skin and keep it exactly perpendicular. Letting the head of the shaver turn toward the blades on either side gets you tiny and painful cuts. Make sure the foil is the only thing that contacts the skin. As I say, it takes practice, but then you&#x27;ll be pleased. Your partner can use it, too.</li>
    <li> I love this razor, bought if for body (manscaping?), but really nice on face too. Guess I&#x27;ll buy a second one, as I don&#x27;t want to use the same razor on my face that I use on my...err.. you get the point. Does a good job everywhere. Great design and battery seems to last forever before it needs a charge.</li>
    <li> The shaver works great for shaving chest and other areas. The trimmer is also works great. I have used the trimmer with its attachments to trim/shape hairs on my head and believe me once you learn to use it you are going to save a lot of barber money.&lt;br /&gt;One little advice for people who have never used a shaver on their body, you might see some red rashes after first use. It is normal as your skin is just not used the touch of a razor.</li>
    <li> The company keeps advertising these as something to \\&quot;shave everywhere\\&quot; with, but I can tell you that I&#x27;ve tried it several times now, and it doesn&#x27;t work! Plain and simple! Sure you might be able to get by shaving larger areas of your body such as your legs, back, chest, or pits, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend trying to shave genital areas or your pubic region like they say you can. If you have fordyce spots (look it up on wikipedia) like many guys do this thing will grab and bit your spotted skin every time. It will make you bleed, and is quite painful. It&#x27;s just not the best for shaving rough, delicate, or textured skin. This thing even had my upper thighs or bikini/speedo line bleeding,and that&#x27;s relatively smooth anyway! Then a few days later I had unsightly red bumps. About the only thing I&#x27;ve found it useful for, is reaching my upper back/shoulders, and occasionally shaving or trimming the pits. If trimming is your forte, this might be okay for you, but even then I caution that. I&#x27;ve found the trimmers to be inaccurate just as they were on the previous generation BodyGroom. The highest setting can even be too short. This is especially true when you have to keep going back over the same area in different directions of hair growth as is advised in the directions. Just shortening my chest hair results in itching and sharp hairs poking through my clothes. After two of these groomers, this is making me strongly consider just being natural, which would be completely normal.</li>
    <li> excellen products. i have been using the older model for years.. I just want to replace it with a newer model and it&#x27;s work fine and look really nice to me...</li>
    <li> I purchased a Norelco Bodygroom about 4 years ago.  I replaced the blade only once, and have nothing but great things to say about this product.  I purchased a new one only because the bezel that alows you to put a different head on the device became loose after years of use.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong - this is expected and will likely occur with any similar product.  I highly suggest the bodygroom whether for grooming your beard or even the more &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; areas.</li>
    <li> No complaints here. I use it both in and out of the shower, and it works great. Plenty of settings depending on how close of a shave you want.</li>
    <li> No nicks and cuts when used near groan areas. Norelco is the best trimmers I&#x27;ve ever used hand down. :)</li>
    <li> This product lasted only a few months before the thin shield atop the blades fell off.  Less than a year from purchase, when I was using it after a recharge, it jammed in the on position and stayed there.  It&#x27;s probably still jammed, outside in the blue recyclable barrel.</li>
    <li> I used have a similar one earlier until that one stopped working. This is little pricier than my earlier groomer. Only drawback that I noticed is that occasionally the blade comes off while grooming.</li>
    <li> It has cut me over and over.  One time I was bleeding from several areas after using the bodygroom.  You have to use the guard but then it hard to get a close cut (not shave).  So either use shave, which is a standard shaver head and thin hairs out.  My 10 dollar beard trimmer works better than this piece of junk.  There are much better razors. save your money.</li>
    <li> It wroks really well but the battery life is a little short for my liking but if you charge it before use every time, you should be fine.</li>
    <li> Best product i&#x27;ve ever bought.. Battery life is amazing, the product is hands down the best product i have ever bought!! Love it</li>
    <li> I am a Norelco fan and this product is one of the reasons.  The other day I was rummaging around trying to find the attachments...  and then I remembered they store neatly in the base, not like my old one that was always missing pieces.  I prefer this to the older model because trimmed hair does not block the cutting heads.  It has just the right attachments to make me smooth from head to toe... well almost.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several of these grooming devices for men, and this is the best one that I&#x27;ve found.  You can use this one on any area of your body without fear of hurting yourself (which is something I think we all take very seriously).  If I had known, though, I would&#x27;ve gotten the cheaper version - it seems like they charge an extra $25 or more for a few plastic attachments that I have found no use for.</li>
    <li> Really easy to use. Versatile with many attachments for different lengths of hair. Good battery life. Easy to switch out attachments.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but am a BELIEVER NOW! Amazing. I&#x27;ve tried to cut myself and haven&#x27;t even brought blood with it in the most sensitive places. If you know what I mean. How long will the blades and motor last?? Not sure but right now it does an awesome job and gets closer than I ever thought possible. Extremely pleased!</li>
    <li> Good value. Useful and reliable. Stays charged. Pleased.</li>
    <li> The product is a great improvement over the previous model. The other one worked well, but the newer model works even better. It does a better job on shaving body hair to a smoother level. Great buy!</li>
    <li> My first official body groomer. So far so good. i like how there is a storage compartment in back to store the accessories.</li>
    <li> I love this thing, it is powerful and the battery lasts long enough to trim up multiple areas without dying. Make sure you have the smoother low pro teeth attached for close trimming jobs in delicate locations-unless you want a blood bath on your hands. Very good quality trimmer/shaver that can be used wet or dry. You can even trim arm and leg hair very fast and neatly with the attachments-no more sketchy undercarriage/nut trimming with scissors. Great value for the money</li>
    <li> I must say that I am impressed with the shaver. Let&#x27;s put it this way. It gets very close, not razor close, but not too far from that. I have yet to draw blood. It will pull some hairs IF you go quickly and the hair is long. I have used it on EVERYTHING and have no complaints. It will not cut you ANYWHERE (beans or frank). Very impressed and very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have used other trimmers and they are not necessarily &amp;#34;kind&amp;#34; to sensitive areas -- nicking your balls or your shaft is not at all fun.  This trimmer works amazingly well and has never nicked my goods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Dr Evil says: &amp;#34;At the age of fourteen a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum... it&#x27;s breathtaking- I highly suggest you try it.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;*Works exactly as advertised&lt;br /&gt;*Allows you to safely shave you sensitive male area without fear of cutting&lt;br /&gt;*Waterproof, works equally well in or out of the shower&lt;br /&gt;*Easy to clean, requires virtually zero maintenance&lt;br /&gt;*Multiple attachments allow for all types of trimming and shaving&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;*Attachment holder is not very secure on base, easily slides out unintentionally&lt;br /&gt;*One of the attachments broke after about nine months, BUT, customer service was excellent and they replaced it immediately (see below)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely EXCELLENT customer service!  I called because one of my attachments was broken; I couldn&#x27;t locate my receipt or the model number, but it didn&#x27;t matter and they sent me a brand new complete unit that arrived in days!  Exceptional customer service, other companies could learn a lesson from Norelco/Philips.</li>
    <li> So I charged this about 3 weeks ago for ten hours when it first arrived. I just used it this morning, and the battery is still going strong. The grip on this product is awesome. The kit fits within the stand which is great; it takes up less space. Moisture doesn&#x27;t seem to affect it in any way. I say this because my bathroom is small and moisture accumulates quickly when I shower. Great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery: 10/10&lt;br /&gt;Product Design: 9/10&lt;br /&gt;Price: 8/10</li>
    <li> This is a very well made body hair trimmer that does as advertised. I have used it twice and it worked perfectly both times. Easy to hold and maneuver. Great blade. I used the attachments at various heights in various areas and was happy with the results everywhere. The wide blade covered a lot of ground quickly and the narrow blade took the hair pin turns. The shaver does a great job as well, gets close safely. If it lets me down, I will be back to update my reviews. After two uses I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It has more power than the last one and the different attachments are very good. Looking forward to a long run</li>
    <li> The item comes well packaged and its easy to plug in and use. The charge time was about an hour, I&#x27;ve used it twice in the shower and it has been ideal for grooming.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I purchased this for my husband.  It is easy to use and works quickly without pain.  I am buying another one for my son!</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time today and it works very well - better than any other shaver I&#x27;ve tried. I used it on my chest, back, arms.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint, and the reason I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars, is that the battery charge didn&#x27;t last very long. Not quite long enough for me to complete the job. Had to recharge and finish&lt;br /&gt;my trim later in the day. Other than the short charge issue I&#x27;m happy with this trimmer.</li>
    <li> I purchased it thinking it would be a lot better but its ok not the worse thing I purchased&lt;br /&gt;The way it was sold to the way you can use it dont really match up</li>
