      <li>I can&#x27;t stress enough how wonderful this stuff is</li>

      <li>I have no idea if it actually works, but I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks yet and my skin feels great.</li>
      <li>Hopefully I can keep my smooth belly post</li>
      <li>and so far so good.</li>
      <li>but so far, so good.  </li>
      <li>but hey, isn&#x27;t it worth a try!  </li>
      <li>In addition the cream has all natural ingredients and it smells amazing.</li>
      <li>Also I love how this tummy rub smells, it&#x27;s a very relaxing scent that compliments how soothing it feels to rub on.</li>
      <li>The product not only helps reduce stretch mark but also smells so good.</li>
      <li>It has a light, fresh citrus scent.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still early, but I am feeling pretty good about Mama Mio&#x27;s products.</li>
      <li>I start using this when i was 12 weeks pregnant</li>
      <li>and it goes away, also I&#x27;m 27 weeks pregnant</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly</li>
      <li>I used this 4 years ago when I was pregnant before</li>
      <li>I started using this cream as soon as I found out that I was 5 weeks pregnant.</li>
      <li>I was using shea butter before I ordered it and it would come thru my tops, this cream goes on and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>It quickly absorbs into the skin and is Non-greasy.</li>
      <li>Bought this at 5 months pregnant with twins.</li>
      <li>She had gotten some when she was pregnant from a friend who had used it when she was pregnant with her twins.</li>
      <li>Beyond the fact that I gained 70 pounds pregnant (don&#x27;t ask...</li>
      <li>Not just when I&#x27;m pregnant.</li>
      <li>I AM 7 MONTH PREGNANT</li>
      <li>Not only does it smell great, but it keeps my stomach so soft and itch free.</li>
      <li>After a lot of research and many recommendations from new moms, I decided to purchase this one.</li>
      <li>Not to mention the ingredients are super safe and natural, you don&#x27;t have to worry about the chemicals that might harm the baby.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
      <li>I gained 60 pounds with my daughter and never had a stretch mark, and so far I&#x27;m getting the same great results this time around.  </li>
      <li>So far, I love everything about this product.</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural and contains all the recommended ingredients to fight off stretchies.</li>
      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>The texture is good too, not as sticky as other brands.</li>
      <li>I can think of any disadvantages right now.</li>
      <li>RIGHT NOW</li>
      <li>Right</li>
      <li>First of all, I elected the free super saver shipping and the product arrived in 4 days, which was several days faster than originally listed.  </li>
      <li>I like the smell, but it is somewhat strong if you are sensitive to fragrances.</li>
      <li>This stretch mark butter glides on smoothly, smells heavenly, and is all natural, so I feel good using it on my belly and anywhere else that I need a little moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>A friend sent me my first jar of this stuff.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>Mama Mio, I think I have found the one that can really fight stretch marks!</li>
      <li>I still use this stuff, just more sparingly since I&#x27; A) smaller, and</li>
      <li>i used it for my first trimester</li>
      <li>I have no stretch marks after my first child.  </li>
      <li>I am 5&#x27;9, and gained 35 lbs with my first pregnancy.  </li>
      <li>Again, I will update more of my results as I get further along with the pregnancy.</li>
      <li>This is my first time trying this</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t think this product was any better for me that regular lotion.</li>
      <li>it is easy to apply, smells lemon like, which is a plus for morning sickness and sensitivity to smells in those early months, and it has been working wonders so far!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s oily when applied, but it&#x27;s very absorbent and does not stick to my clothes.</li>
      <li>The shipment/delivery was really fast.  </li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>It really helped my tummy to not feel itchy, however don&#x27;t expect that you won&#x27;t get any stretch marks just because you use this.  </li>
      <li>many other creams and body butters leave your skin greasy or oily, or they don&#x27;t sink in and basically don&#x27;t moisturize at all, plus they can smell terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>not sure if it&#x27;ll be as great for my last trimester</li>
      <li>Being single, I can&#x27;t reach all of the spots on my back at this point, but where I do manage to get a good application, it completely alleviates itch.</li>
      <li>So glad to find it for half the price on amazon.  </li>
      <li>But for the time being, I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I have also ordered the oil to go with it, after trying both together, I usually use the oil first then apply the butter, the oil actually makes the butter a lot easier to apply too, I just absolutely love this product!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After carefully reviewing all the similar products, trust me, with my mom and my sister having stretch marks, a lot of them, I am super afraid of getting them myself! So I found mama mio. it is easy to apply, smells lemon like, which is a plus for morning sickness and sensitivity to smells in those early months, and it has been working wonders so far! I have also ordered the oil to go with it, after trying both together, I usually use the oil first then apply the butter, the oil actually makes the butter a lot easier to apply too, I just absolutely love this product! Not to mention the ingredients are super safe and natural, you don&#x27;t have to worry about the chemicals that might harm the baby.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Mama Mio, I think I have found the one that can really fight stretch marks!</li>
    <li> Did not work for me other than to prevent scratching. In fact no cream worked for me, but there are others that are cheaper.</li>
    <li> Bought this at 5 months pregnant with twins. It has a really nice scent and absorbs well into the skin, not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a coworker and I didn&#x27;t start using the product until I was 20 weeks along. I didn&#x27;t get ANY stretch marks and the lotion smells very nice! I will definitely buy this product when I have my next child.</li>
    <li> This along with the mama mio oil is one of the best purchases ever. I used it throughout my pregnancy after 4 months (when I started to show) and I have not one stretch mark! I used it morning and before bed, sometimes during the day if I felt dry/itchy. I will pay for this any day that I&#x27;m prego!</li>
    <li> I loved the scent and this was one of my favorite pregnancy products with my first. I plan to use it again for my second.&lt;br /&gt;Its very light and not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S No stretchmarks!!! :)</li>
    <li> So far, I love everything about this product. I&#x27;m only 20 weeks into my pregnancy and will update this as I get further along with my term. I started using this cream as soon as I found out that I was 5 weeks pregnant. I am Asian and all the women in my family had stretch marks from their pregnancies, so I was really fearful that I would or will get them too. I mainly use this as a preventive way to at least reduce the amount of scars or stretch marks that I will probably get. I was very thin and petite during my per pregnancy days. Right now, my belly, hips, thighs, and hips has gotten much bigger. My husband applies this cream along with Mama Mio Tummy Rub Stretch Mark Oil on me every night. I love the smell. It&#x27;s really light scented. This is our routine that I look forward to everyday. In fact, it&#x27;s probably my favorite part of the day is to pamper myself. Lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is a bit thick and we use about a nickel/quarter size amount each time. It&#x27;s oily when applied, but it&#x27;s very absorbent and does not stick to my clothes. I am now on my second jar and bottle. The shipment/delivery was really fast.  So far, I have not had any signs of stretch marks.  It&#x27;s still early, but I am feeling pretty good about Mama Mio&#x27;s products. I can think of any disadvantages right now. Again, I will update more of my results as I get further along with the pregnancy. But for the time being, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Only started to use this product and I really like it. It leaves my skin smooth and soft. I will update after I give birth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second pregnancy in the third trimester and use this twice a day just like I did for the first.  I gained 60 pounds with my daughter and never had a stretch mark, and so far I&#x27;m getting the same great results this time around.  I have super-sensitive skin and I love this product!  It absorbs quickly so I can get dressed within minutes of applying it, it&#x27;s very soft and smells great too, it&#x27;s the best out there in my opinion!!</li>
    <li> They use this product for the pre natal massage at The Ritz and I loved it! So glad to find it for half the price on amazon.  It&#x27;s very thick, but not greasy and keeps my skin hydrated all day.  Smell is very nice - not too fruity or noticeable, so you can still smell like you and not the lotion!</li>
    <li> No stretch marks! I gained 25 pounds and this worked for me. I have stretch marks from weight gain in the past, but none from my pregnancy. I used it from month 3-9. If you are going to spoil yourself during your pregnancy, buy this!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lotion!  Two pregnancies and no stretch marks!  I used it with my first pregnancy and now with my second!</li>
    <li> I am now 7 1/2 months along and I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 4 months regularly.  In the last few weeks, I have been using it with the matching Tummy oil.  Right after I shower, I apply the oil everywhere I can reach between my neck and my knees, and then I top it off with a  layer of the Tummy Rub butter.  It feels great, my baby seems to like the massage, and I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks to date.  The few stretch marks I had on my breasts and hips prior to pregnancy have faded some, too.  I also get relief from the occasional itching with this stuff.  It&#x27;s pricey, but I&#x27;m afraid to change course at this point because it works so well.  Hopefully I can keep my smooth belly post pregnancy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aside, I only shower once daily, so at bedtime I apply Mederma for stretch marks.  The butter is much easier to spread on moist skin and oiled skin (I use less that way), but if I&#x27;m not freshly showered, this keeps things moist for the night.</li>
    <li> mama mio butter is the best, it help me with the itches, it moisturize my tummy so good(: and best of all no stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 2 pregnancies. Not only did it help me to not get stretch marks, but it soothed the itchy belly feeling I would get sometimes. Also I love how this tummy rub smells, it&#x27;s a very relaxing scent that compliments how soothing it feels to rub on.</li>
    <li> The product not only helps reduce stretch mark but also smells so good. The texture is good too, not as sticky as other brands. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Even though I personally believe absolutely no product makes a bit of difference as to whether or not you get stretch marks (it&#x27;s totally genetic), I love this product so much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells so so so so good! And it is the perfect consistency. When you rub it in it&#x27;s not greasy or oily at all, but it is very moisturizing and makes your skin so soft. It is just an awesome product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So many other creams and body butters leave your skin greasy or oily, or they don&#x27;t sink in and basically don&#x27;t moisturize at all, plus they can smell terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mama Mio Tummy Rub Stretch Mark Butter is one of my favorite products of all time. Not just when I&#x27;m pregnant.</li>
    <li> I USED IT FOR ABOUT 4 MONTH, IT&#x27;S GREAT. I AM 7 MONTH PREGNANT RIGHT NOW AND DO NOT HAVE A STRETCH MARK ON MY BELLY. HOPEFULLY IT WILL WORK TO THE END. BUT IT IS A LITTLE PRICY THOUGH.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month or longer, and am currently in Week 24. I can certainly feel my skin stretching a lot, due to my fairly sudden increase in girth, but haven&#x27;t noticed any marks yet using this, in conjunction with the oil. The oil alone is a bit much (oily), but if I follow with the butter, this tames it down, and keeps everything soft and moisturized all day. Being single, I can&#x27;t reach all of the spots on my back at this point, but where I do manage to get a good application, it completely alleviates itch.</li>
    <li> The Mama Mio Tummy Rub stretch mark butter is awesome! After a lot of research and many recommendations from new moms, I decided to purchase this one. So happy I did! I&#x27;m still in the very early stages so I can&#x27;t speak on its effectiveness, but I&#x27;m being proactive. The texture is smooth and velvety, very thick and moisturizes the skin extremely well. I like the smell, but it is somewhat strong if you are sensitive to fragrances. I love that it&#x27;s all natural and contains all the recommended ingredients to fight off stretchies. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Have used it since I found out my pregnancy, now I&#x27;m 6 months and no stretch marks!!!  Great citric scent too!!!&lt;br /&gt;The delivery from amazon itself was very disappointing.. Ordered a week ahead of time bc I was running out and never got my product before 12 days.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! The smell is quite pleasant and it feels so nice on the skin that is being stretched by your baby. It really helped my tummy to not feel itchy, however don&#x27;t expect that you won&#x27;t get any stretch marks just because you use this.  I do believe that it helped, but I still got a couple anyway. That being said, I would still recommend it.  I really enjoyed using it.</li>
    <li> Smell makes me gag and it&#x27;s REALLY strong. Had to wash it off. Will just throw it away, what a waste.</li>
    <li> I am 5&#x27;9, and gained 35 lbs with my first pregnancy.  I typically put lotion on my stomach everyday even pre-pregnancy.  I have no stretch marks after my first child.  I really don&#x27;t think this product was any better for me that regular lotion.</li>
    <li> First of all, I elected the free super saver shipping and the product arrived in 4 days, which was several days faster than originally listed.  I have been using this on top of applying a layer of Bio-Oil twice a day and not a stretch mark or &amp;#34;twin skin&amp;#34; in sight! I can&#x27;t stress enough how wonderful this stuff is and it smells so light and clean unlike some of the other stretch mark creams on the market which don&#x27;t seem to properly absorb into my skin and smell so heavy.  Wonderful product and the Atlas Supply Chain company exceeded my expectations with their fast shipping. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying this and so far so good. One thing I particularly like is it&#x27;s not very greasy. I was using shea butter before I ordered it and it would come thru my tops, this cream goes on and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since&lt;br /&gt;Early pregnancy and my skin feels hydrated at all times and got little stretch marks. For the ones I got towards the end of my pregnancy I&#x27;m applying more often the lotion and they are slowly vanishing now that my baby is 7 weeks old. Slowly but patiently this will help me</li>
    <li> This tummy butter is thick, moisturizing and has a nice smell. I have no idea if it actually works, but I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks yet and my skin feels great.</li>
    <li> I love this product, whenever my belly starts to itch I apply lotion and it goes away, also I&#x27;m 27 weeks pregnant and so far I haven&#x27;t developed stretch marks. In addition the cream has all natural ingredients and it smells amazing.</li>
    <li> I used this 4 years ago when I was pregnant before and I am glad it is still here. I am using it again and it is excellent. It quickly absorbs into the skin and is Non-greasy. It has a light, fresh citrus scent.  My only complaint is that you do have to use alot of it and it does not last long. For me, 1 jar only lasts 1 month.</li>
    <li> I love Mama Mio.  This stretch mark butter glides on smoothly, smells heavenly, and is all natural, so I feel good using it on my belly and anywhere else that I need a little moisturizer.  It also absorbs really well and does not feel sticky or heavy..  No stretch marks so far, but I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s due to the the cream.  And my belly never itches.  No complaints!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the you know what!  Beyond the fact that I gained 70 pounds pregnant (don&#x27;t ask...I went from being vegetarian to a KFC afficianado...not to worry, I&#x27;ve recovered from this mental illness) and that I don&#x27;t have a single stretch mark, it smells delish and became such a nice nighttime \\&quot;me\\&quot; routine.  I still use this stuff, just more sparingly since I&#x27; A) smaller, and B) now it&#x27;s just for lotion, not serving a purpose of staving off dreaded stretch marks!  If you&#x27;re preggo, splurge and get this and the tummy rub oil.  I know, I know stretch marks are hereditary-blah- but hey, isn&#x27;t it worth a try!  Thank you for this product!</li>
    <li> This stuff totally works - no stretch marks, no itchy belly, smells great - and my husband loves the fragrance too. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> I start using this when i was 12 weeks pregnant i run out for a couple of days and use the one that sales in stores. But!! A lot itch. When i got this again i was relieve because no more ich and reduce the appareance of strech marks. My skin loves it!!! Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> i used it for my first trimester and it worked great.  not sure if it&#x27;ll be as great for my last trimester but so far, so good.  xoxo.</li>
    <li> A friend sent me my first jar of this stuff. She had gotten some when she was pregnant from a friend who had used it when she was pregnant with her twins. Not only does it smell great, but it keeps my stomach so soft and itch free. I can tell the days I forget to put it on. It is worth every penny.</li>
