### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>brother :-D)</li>
      <li>It works GREAT!</li>
      <li>It seemed to work the best around my mouth, but it was not a drastic difference.  </li>
      <li>It happens to me all the time that on the day when I need to look my best</li>
      <li>You need to follow the directions closely to get the best results of course, but it does work and seems to hold up for a couple of hours alone or under makeup.</li>
      <li>CONSUMMATE CONNECTICUT:</li>
      <li>but it works great, tightens up the under-eye skin.</li>
      <li>I am really happy with this product, though.</li>
      <li>have had none of the issues with the pump that others have experienced.</li>
      <li>Even with a great deal of care, there comes a time when we all start to notice \\&quot;experience lines\\&quot; and look for the products that can help us minimize the impact on our look.  </li>
      <li>This is when the Wrinkle Reducer will be of great use.</li>
      <li>It has not irritated my skin and seems fairly gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would have loved even a temporary skin softening effect, but came up with nil.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good moisturizer, but the miracle cream that will erase signs of aging has yet to be invented.</li>
      <li>Although it&#x27;s not a miracle product, when using it I look like I&#x27;ve had a good night&#x27;s sleep even if I haven&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been wisely said, that we spend our youth seeking fortune, then spend our fortune seeking youth.  </li>
      <li>and I am very satisfied.</li>
      <li>My wife tell me she is very pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>Am very satisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>It did everything it said it would very pleased with the product.</li>
      <li>hope you enjoyed this review!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Following the directions exactly provided the best benefits.  </li>
      <li>This product is amazing.</li>
      <li>(yes, one can get nice deoderants w/o it).  </li>
      <li>The product does wear off as the day goes on, but it is pretty awesome for most of the day.</li>
      <li>I was happy to see that Hydroxatone 90 did exactly what it said it would.</li>
      <li>You know how you read something that sounds too good to be true?  </li>
      <li>In looking at my own skin, I noticed the fine lines which were appearing had diminished rapidly and it looked firmer.</li>
      <li>There is no possibility that the product could be applied using the aerosol spray top.</li>
      <li>I speculate that after this plumping results, the product solidifies, holding the surface area in that more taunt attitude.</li>
      <li>For the cost, seems they&#x27;d come up with better delivery system.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d rather focus on something that might take longer to provide results, but have those results be more substantial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When I put moisturizer on top, I felt that it was undoing the wrinkle</li>
      <li>So, yes, I would recommend this product to anyone wishing to look better and feel better about the look of their skin.</li>
      <li>However, it did seem to smooth out my face in a way that made my make-up go on nicely.</li>
      <li>* - geez - okay</li>
      <li>This stuff is just okay.</li>
      <li>, I found that it worked better over moisturizer than under.  </li>
      <li>or they&#x27;ll never sell many.</li>
      <li>I also feel more awake, because of the skin tightening around my eyes.  </li>
      <li>I followed the application procedures and applied it under one eye, hoping to be able to judge the comparison.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t expect a craggy Tommy Lee Jones face to be turned into a Justin Beiber baby face like a wave of a magic wand.</li>
      <li>However, the puffiness is reduced and I feel more awake.  </li>
      <li>But, I&#x27;m not so sure about this product, not yet.</li>
      <li>I will say that this product seemed to work the best and show the best results on fine lines above my upper lip.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Even though I won&#x27;t use it every day (mainly because I don&#x27;t want to add another 90 seconds of motionless face time to my makeup routine), it&#x27;s good to have when you need some extra help to look your best!</li>
      <li>things in life, the maxim holds true that if something sounds too good to be true.........</li>
      <li>As all things in life, the maxim holds true that if something sounds too good to be true.........</li>
      <li>, manufacturers - consider making the container not so cheap, for it works as if it belongs on a bargain shelf and not a $60 shelf, though you could make the case that you save money on the package to make a better product, but I ain&#x27;t \\&quot;buying\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I was excited to try this product to see if I could get an even more youthful appearance.  </li>
      <li>product gives you a very mild tightening sensation when it starts to work</li>
      <li>It also contains \\&quot;optically advanced light-diffusing ingredients\\&quot; (whatever those are) which reflect and diffuse the light around your eyes, giving you (temporarily) a brighter, more youthful glow (something that Hollywood has been doing with movie makeup for years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
      <li>To be honest, I thought this product was some sort of a gimmick at first.</li>
      <li>I have some crows feet and some fine lines around my mouth and on my forehead that I was hoping this product would help minimize.  </li>
      <li>Works just fine for me each time.  </li>
      <li>I felt the tightening effect immediately and the fine lines around my eyes seemed to disappear.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a cheap temporary fix which I guess is what is meant to be.</li>
      <li>It reminded me of the cheap perfume samples they hand out sometimes at the mall.  </li>
      <li>But the masque will smooth out your face and hold it in place for a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Psychologically, do I feel better because I look better, or do I look better because I feel better?  </li>
      <li>If I can answer any questions, feel free to add a comment</li>
      <li>I knew that if I looked in the mirror during this time I would laugh, so I walked to another room to distract myself!</li>
      <li>The directions are fairly straightforward: you apply the product to an expressionless face, then hold that look for 90 seconds while the product sets.</li>
      <li>a temporary quick fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The name of the product is fairly accurate.  </li>
      <li>This comes especially useful for people who go on business trips and want to look well-rested and young</li>
      <li>Oh how I detest the forehead butt - though I&#x27;m in good company and think it&#x27;s actually a sign of intelligence, wit, and all around awesomeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>product is OK, I have used other products that work better, with a more noticeable difference.  </li>
      <li>because apparently the silver top flakes off - Lawd!</li>
      <li>I think, honestly, for the price, I&#x27;d want either more product, better packaging, or even more dramatic results.</li>
      <li>Im really glad this happened the first time I tried it because it stripped ALL the colour from the fabrics just like pure bleach.</li>
      <li>Then, when I applied it, I did not notice much of a difference in the appearance of my fine lines.  </li>
      <li>Having tried many products that claim to \\&quot;reduce the appearance\\&quot; of fine lines and wrinkles, I ordered Hydroxatone 90 Second Wrinkle Reducer to see how this type of face cream might work.</li>
      <li>I guess this form of application smoothes the product more into the fine lines because I tried it this way the very next day and noticed a difference immediately.</li>
      <li>My guess is that this is probably better for someone with fine lines than deep wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>She has tried several products and not been thrilled with any of them</li>
      <li>I can see a distinct difference.  </li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s worth a $55 price tag.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not inexpensive, and, quite frankly,there are other products that strike me as being more worthwhile.  </li>
      <li>liked never to have squirted out any of the product when I first tried it - then it came out in a blob - which it has done several times since then.</li>
      <li>Cool sensation when applying, very soothing.</li>
      <li>I suspect the ages of 40-50s will have the most success, the skin likely to achieve desired results with application as directed.</li>
      <li>I received this 90 second wrinkle reducer with great skepticism especially after seeing the not so inexpensive price.</li>
      <li>I had no problems with getting the wrinkle reducer formula out of the container as it seems other reviewers had, but, most important</li>
      <li>The little pump design is a good idea, it just doesn&#x27;t work well for some reason.</li>
      <li>First off - read the instructions and don&#x27;t expect miracles.  </li>
      <li>but the pump does not work, I have to open the top to get anything out, it looks like the pump attachment that goes into the tube was never attached.&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, its existence gives us hope that a similar product with a more permanent effect would soon be invented.</li>
      <li>Because after following them (using 1 pump of the product and applying by patting it on only) and getting lackluster results, I was thinking that using more lotion or layering it on would provide better results.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this several times and had friends comment that my skin looked better</li>
      <li>The pump doesn&#x27;t give you enough control, so you end up pushing out more product than you need.</li>
      <li>For the price it definitely should have better packaging.</li>
      <li>It really worked!  </li>
      <li>As a 37-year-old woman with very fair skin, I take my skin-care regime and the products I use very seriously.</li>
      <li>product barely made an impact on the fine lines on my face.  </li>
      <li>If the pump worked properly and reliably, I would probably buy this to keep on hand, but for now I will use what I have left and call it good.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The tightening feel of the product does have a positive psychological effect and one would expect good results, but, in the end, my crow&#x27;s feet and lines appeared the same.</li>
      <li>I also tried crinkling my eyes a few minutes later when I smiled to see if the fine lines would reappear, and they didn&#x27;t!</li>
      <li>My son said I looked just like my photo&#x27;s taken in the 80&#x27;s!!&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution, if you apply Hydroxatone 90 Second Wrinkle Reducer to your fine lines, make sure to put concealer or foundation over it, as it turns a powdery white otherwise.</li>
      <li>First of all, the pump that it comes in does not work very well at all.  </li>
      <li>Someone once told me that a quick fix is gone just as quickly, and that&#x27;s definitely the case here.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Has a tendency to clog making it hard to get the product out in small amounts. Works well but if you get just a little too much it will leave white streaks on your face after it dries out.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Instant softening of wrinkles. Cool sensation when applying, very soothing. Only challenge is ensuring you use very little, otherwise a whitish powder appears.</li>
    <li> My wife tell me she is very pleased with the results.  The dispenser has been difficult at times as noted by others but it has not yet failed completely.</li>
    <li> The product works to some degree, however if you use a little too much it leaves a white coating which is a little embaracing, because it doesn&#x27;t  show up for about half an hour. The same thing happens with youthology</li>
    <li> the transaction went well and I am very satisfied. Irv Hoffman</li>
    <li> This stuff is just okay. It does help smooth out wrinkles a very tiny but, but it feels very sticky and crusty.</li>
    <li> To be honest, I thought this product was some sort of a gimmick at first. However, I have to recognize that it works in a way I could have never imagined. My husband has 3 deep wrinkles on his forehead. I applied the Wrinkle Reducer to them (you only need a very small amount, there is no need to lather it on), and within 90 seconds, the wrinkles began to disappear as if somebody was wiping them off. They left almost imperceptible white lines in their wake which looked as if drawn by a thin pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product gives you a very mild tightening sensation when it starts to work but it is in no way painful or uncomfortable. Even deep mimic lines disappear, not to speak of crow&#x27;s feet and smaller wrinkles that are erased completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, this product is not permanent. It has a temporary effect which usually wears off by the time you go to bed. It doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for your appearance on a permanent basis, but the temporary effect is stunning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How often does it happen that the night before a crucial meeting, an important date, a job interview, a conference talk, a high-school reunion you feel too stressed and can&#x27;t manage to fall asleep? It happens to me all the time that on the day when I need to look my best I wake up looking like I&#x27;m a hundred years old. This is when the Wrinkle Reducer will be of great use. It allows one to get one&#x27;s appearance where it would be without a sleepless night and feeling stressed. The container it comes in is small enough for one to carry it around all the time. This comes especially useful for people who go on business trips and want to look well-rested and young while there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, such a product only has a temporary effect. However, its existence gives us hope that a similar product with a more permanent effect would soon be invented. I have to say, I haven&#x27;t felt this excited about a facial care product for a long time. 90 Second Wrinkle Reducer really does what it promises.</li>
    <li> Almost hate to positively review this because it&#x27;s SO AWESOME and I don&#x27;t ever want it to be out of stock but it works great, tightens up the under-eye skin. Just need to get the timing down to apply concealer or else it will look dry and patchy.</li>
    <li> It did everything it said it would very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> 7 pumps and it was empty! The silver ring on top of blue bottle starts to chip into tiny pieces. These silver pieces get all over hands &amp; face.</li>
    <li> I would definitely say that this product does what it advertises, but long term expectations will depend on skin type and age. I suspect the ages of 40-50s will have the most success, the skin likely to achieve desired results with application as directed. Skin definitely tightens around the area of applications, more effective around the eyes than lines around the mouth (smokers may be disappointed). This may or may not be a product to use daily, but I would want to see if the skin around eyes dries out from frequent use. Unless a customer is obsessed with lines around eyes and lips, this may be a product to use sparingly or for special occasions. Luan Gaines/2013.</li>
    <li> Having tried many products that claim to \\&quot;reduce the appearance\\&quot; of fine lines and wrinkles, I ordered Hydroxatone 90 Second Wrinkle Reducer to see how this type of face cream might work. It promises, when a small amount of the cream is applied around the eyes, to reduce crows feet, puffiness, etc., and to do the same on other parts of the face. I tried the comparison test, applying the product to one eye and not the other. The first hour or so, there did seem to be some reduction in under-eye puffiness, but this effect was short-lived and minimal. It&#x27;s a good moisturizer, but the miracle cream that will erase signs of aging has yet to be invented. (Alas!)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cheap temporary fix which I guess is what is meant to be. I was surprised that after 20 mins it was still in place and held for 2-3 hurs. Feels a little stange at first but if you cant get your face done before the Oscars this would carry you through for a night! Be careful about the amoint used or it dries in white patches and looks wierd.. not too bad really</li>
    <li> This product did reduce the wrinkles under my eyes and made that part of my face feel renewed. The pump bottle broke after a few pumps.</li>
    <li> It really worked!  After having tried other similar products - this one I could actually see the improvement.  You should try it for yourself!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even pronounce half the ingredients in this product.  When I first used it, I had white flaky stuff appearing on my skin so reduced the amount I used.  My skin is dry and sensitive and when I put moisturizer on before or afterwards, it seems to negate any effect it might have.  If I leave it by itself, it feels a little tight.  But here&#x27;s the thing--the container doesn&#x27;t work now.  You pump and nothing comes out where it should.  If you press it down further, the product oozes up the sides of the pump and makes a mess.  They need to get this design nailed down or they&#x27;ll never sell many.</li>
    <li> Reviewed by my wife:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost every woman will admit that she is seeking the magic beauty product, so I was really curious to see what 90 second Hydroxatone eye lift would actually do.  Worst case, lift my eye bags for 90 seconds?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I cracked open the package and began the adventure. The directions are fairly straightforward: you apply the product to an expressionless face, then hold that look for 90 seconds while the product sets. I knew that if I looked in the mirror during this time I would laugh, so I walked to another room to distract myself! The dispenser is a little on the unreliable side as to how much product it will/won&#x27;t dispense with one pump.  This is a clear gel, with the consistency of egg whites.  It does take a little practice to learn to evenly spread it; otherwise you get some buildup of gel residue that looks like you failed to wash your face.  Although it&#x27;s not a miracle product, when using it I look like I&#x27;ve had a good night&#x27;s sleep even if I haven&#x27;t.  Even though I won&#x27;t use it every day (mainly because I don&#x27;t want to add another 90 seconds of motionless face time to my makeup routine), it&#x27;s good to have when you need some extra help to look your best!</li>
    <li> Product doesn&#x27;t tighten skin. It leaves a white film in several areas.</li>
    <li> I used to use a terrific temporary-but-instant plumping product from Avon, and unfortunately they stopped making it. Since then I have been looking for a product to replace it, and this is not it. This stuff makes your skin feel tight where you put it, and not in a comfortable way. And it leaves flakes when it dries. Didn&#x27;t like this AT ALL. I will have to keep looking for my miracle product.</li>
    <li> I got this wrinkle reducer for review through the Vine Program and was looking forward to trying it. Regrettably I was unable to do so because the pump was defective and I could not get any product to dispense regardless of how or how often I tried. Other reviewers seem to have had issues with the pump as well, and in my opinion a product that goes for that much money should have a reliable delivery system. Therefore my rating is strictly for the functionality of the bottle and not the product itself.</li>
    <li> I tried this on lines by the eyes: there was definitely a difference, almost immediately, just as promised.  Someone once told me that a quick fix is gone just as quickly, and that&#x27;s definitely the case here. Also, the improvement was just not dramatic enough for me. My guess is that this is probably better for someone with fine lines than deep wrinkles.  At this point, my wife tells me, only Botox will help!  I still hold out hope, though I&#x27;m probably not going to try this Hydroxatone product again.  It&#x27;s not inexpensive, and, quite frankly,there are other products that strike me as being more worthwhile.  I&#x27;d rather focus on something that might take longer to provide results, but have those results be more substantial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest qualm is that you can actually feel the product stretching the skin tight.  It&#x27;s not \\&quot;uncomfortable\\&quot; per se, but it is an odd sensation at first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw, I found that it worked better over moisturizer than under.  The packaging says to try it both ways.  When I put moisturizer on top, I felt that it was undoing the wrinkle reduction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any problem with the dispenser.  Reading other reviews, I guess I was lucky?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you enjoyed this review!  If it was helpful, please click so below.  If I can answer any questions, feel free to add a comment and I will try to get back to you ASAP.</li>
    <li> When I went to use this product a small amount leaked &amp; landed on the top I was wearing &amp; on my doona cover. Im really glad this happened the first time I tried it because it stripped ALL the colour from the fabrics just like pure bleach. There is no way that stuff will be going on my face.</li>
    <li> It really has helped with the surrounding area of my eyes where with age you get that sunken look and it helped fill that out. Am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on the lookout these days for anti-aging products.  However, I do care about the ingredients in these products-- I&#x27;m not going the surgery or injection route, and questionable compounds, such as those containing aluminum, are also OUT.  Aluminum compounds in bodycare products have been questioned since the 1980s, and for me, I just don&#x27;t care to use the ones containing aluminium (yes, one can get nice deoderants w/o it).  This is the first \\&quot;instant\\&quot; facial tightener I decided to try, but I&#x27;ll give it a pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bad for not reading the ingredients prior to ordering.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s what this \\&quot;Hydroxatone 90 Second Wrinkle Reducer\\&quot; essentially is--eye glue.  It&#x27;s a thin masque that stretches out your wrinkles and holds them in place for a temporary quick fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The name of the product is fairly accurate.  Follow the directions (which is important) and 90 seconds later you will see some wrinkle reduction.  Note the key word \\&quot;reduction.\\&quot;  You can&#x27;t expect a craggy Tommy Lee Jones face to be turned into a Justin Beiber baby face like a wave of a magic wand. But the masque will smooth out your face and hold it in place for a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting the balance right can be difficult.  Too much, and you have crusty, white flaking on your face. Too little and it won&#x27;t hold. But if you follow the directions you should have between 3-5 hours of reduced wrinkles before it wears off. Oh, and be prepared for your face to feel weird--it is being stretched with a thin glue masque on it, after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a specific product for a specific reason.  If you have a scheduled public appearance, a job interview, going to get some pictures taken, etc ... then it will hold back the tides of time long enough to get you through, But like Cinderella and her magic pumpkin, you don&#x27;t want to be there when the clock strikes and your fairytale prince turns back into reality. I don&#x27;t think I would use this for a first date, unless you knew in advance things weren&#x27;t going to extend past a few hours, or if you are prepared to run to the bathroom for a quick re-gluing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big negative for \\&quot;Hydroxatone 90 Second Wrinkle Reducer\\&quot; is the design of the packaging.  The pump doesn&#x27;t give you enough control, so you end up pushing out more product than you need. Considering how much it costs, that can be expensive waste.</li>
    <li> The little pump design is a good idea, it just doesn&#x27;t work well for some reason. I have to pump it several times and it will either dispense a tiny drop or shoot out a stream of the gel that ends up being wasted. When you do finally get the product out of the tube and are able to actually use it, it does what it says. It does tighten the skin and decrease the look of any crows feet you might have. You need to follow the directions closely to get the best results of course, but it does work and seems to hold up for a couple of hours alone or under makeup. If the pump worked properly and reliably, I would probably buy this to keep on hand, but for now I will use what I have left and call it good.</li>
    <li> Maybe a 3 and a half or three and three-quarters stars would be more accurate?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would really think the best product out there that doesn&#x27;t require surgery or injections or fillers is probably one of the prescription-strength retinoids, and really, though expensive, the retinoids cost less than this product when you consider cost per ounces. What cost vanity - well, dang, I dunno.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked never to have squirted out any of the product when I first tried it - then it came out in a blob - which it has done several times since then. So, yeah, be careful pumping - this stuff is expensive without having to scrape it off a wall or your sleeve or the mirror (I draw the line at the bathroom floor, though it was tempting) just so you don&#x27;t waste any. For the cost, seems they&#x27;d come up with better delivery system. And, more product - how vain am I that I&#x27;d want to spend $60 on such a small amount of something that may smooth out a few wrinkles - I&#x27;m still debating. I&#x27;m 55 and not heavily wrinkled, though I do see changes on my face that I&#x27;d like to find products that help make me feel all glowy and smoothy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some products I receive through Vine that I KNOW I&#x27;ll re-order, and I do. But, I&#x27;m not so sure about this product, not yet. I think, honestly, for the price, I&#x27;d want either more product, better packaging, or even more dramatic results. However, it did seem to smooth out my face in a way that made my make-up go on nicely. I didn&#x27;t slather it all over my face, just in certain areas, waited, and then did my usual make-up routine. I think it did help with crows feet, but I really don&#x27;t mind my crows feet so for sixty bucks, still not sure. Also, a serum I use, and a primer, seems to have sort of the same effect of my make up going on smoother and my face looking smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t expect it to get rid of my \\&quot;Forehead Butt\\&quot; (my brother&#x27;s name for that deep line between my brows, thank you very much --NOT!-- brother :-D), butI put some there anyway and thought it may have smoothed it out a little. If it had really plumped up that forehead butt, I&#x27;d be vain enough to spend $60 on that tiny tube, oh yes I would! Oh how I detest the forehead butt - though I&#x27;m in good company and think it&#x27;s actually a sign of intelligence, wit, and all around awesomeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you have some money to throw around and like spending it on cosmetics - then I&#x27;d say try it. You will see some results. As for me, yeah, still on the fence - I just think I&#x27;ll have a problem spending $60 on that tiny amount for something that I&#x27;m not sure does quite enough for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: - well dangity all to dangtown but I walked about with a shiny silver dot on my nose for who knows how long - because apparently the silver top flakes off - Lawd! *laughing* - geez - okay, manufacturers - consider making the container not so cheap, for it works as if it belongs on a bargain shelf and not a $60 shelf, though you could make the case that you save money on the package to make a better product, but I ain&#x27;t \\&quot;buying\\&quot; that, y&#x27;all. I have other products that cost much much less that have sturdier containers/tubes/bottles/etc.</li>
    <li> As a 37-year-old woman with very fair skin, I take my skin-care regime and the products I use very seriously. Even with a great deal of care, there comes a time when we all start to notice \\&quot;experience lines\\&quot; and look for the products that can help us minimize the impact on our look.  Unfortunately, I am going to have to keep looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product barely made an impact on the fine lines on my face.  I followed the application procedures and applied it under one eye, hoping to be able to judge the comparison. Even after waiting for a bit, I saw no real difference.  What I did see was so slight that I wondered if it was down to wishful thinking.  The next day when I tried this same application on the other eye, I called my husband in to see if he could pick the eye that had been treated.  Sadly, he could not.  I tried it for several days with the hopes that perhaps there would be some sort of cumulative effect, but there was not.  It did seem to make the skin feel a bit more soft, so at least there was that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if the product had worked, the dispenser was horrible.  It reminded me of the cheap perfume samples they hand out sometimes at the mall.  The pump barely moves at all and when it does, you either get nothing, or a double-dose.  Considering the price of this little bottle, you would think they could put more effort into the dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this product as much better results can be had with a simple moisturizer applied twice daily.</li>
    <li> This small tube contained a gel the consistency of custard. There is no possibility that the product could be applied using the aerosol spray top. It is too thick. I wonder if the bottle I received was old and had lost moisture.  It was possible for me to use a toothpick to apply the cream around my eyes. You can feel the skin tightening almost immediately. It works about half as long as advertised on crows feet and has almost no effect on forehead wrinkles. After it wears off, the crows feet don&#x27;t look that much worse than before application; maybe just a little bit deeper wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I received my Hydroxatone 90 Second Wrinkle Reducer and was excited to use it but the pump does not work, I have to open the top to get anything out, it looks like the pump attachment that goes into the tube was never attached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is OK, I have used other products that work better, with a more noticeable difference.  I will say that this product seemed to work the best and show the best results on fine lines above my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do need to be careful, if you put on too much your skin tends to look like you have something white stuck to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, for the price, I think I&#x27;ll stick with my old brand.</li>
    <li> I have to admit to just turning 50 and I suppose vanity did come in as part of my reason for trying this product. I have a friend in Canada who is much older than I am who is constantly on about the appearance of her skin and aging. She has tried several products and not been thrilled with any of them so when I thought about trying one, I chose this instead of the brands she had already used. I have to say, it did work as advertised. I don&#x27;t have a lot of crows feet or wrinkling yet, but enough to show my age. I&#x27;ve used this several times and had friends comment that my skin looked better and I looked younger too. In looking at my own skin, I noticed the fine lines which were appearing had diminished rapidly and it looked firmer. So, yes, I would recommend this product to anyone wishing to look better and feel better about the look of their skin.</li>
    <li> This actually does slightly reduce the appearance of fine lines surrounding my eyes for a few hours! You need very little (which is part of the trick), because if you use just a tad too much you&#x27;ll end up looking like you have sleep-eye film (white, dusty patches), which is less attractive than fine lines. I see it solely as a temporary (as in you might have to reapply it every couple of hours) treatment, though, and reviewing the ingredients I don&#x27;t see the purpose for such a high price. If this product conditioned your skin and encouraged collagen production and cell turnover...well, then maybe the price would be valid. If this product was in the mid-$20 range, I&#x27;d have given it that additional star. I just don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s worth a $55 price tag.</li>
    <li> I was happy to see that Hydroxatone 90 did exactly what it said it would. I felt the tightening effect immediately and the fine lines around my eyes seemed to disappear. I agree with the other reviewers who were not happy with the dispenser. No matter how I used the pump, too much of the product came out and I feel like it was wasted. When I received this product through the Amazon Vine program I had no idea it was so expensive until I went to post my review. For the price it definitely should have better packaging. My stars are for the wrinkle reducer. The dispenser deserves less.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been wisely said, that we spend our youth seeking fortune, then spend our fortune seeking youth.  While few of us would dispose of the wisdom and experience age brings, almost all of us wake up one day shocked that we haven&#x27;t been the lone person to escape the effects of time and stress and gravity.  Marketers are all to happy to prey on these revelations and offer expensive little potions in crystal containers with exotic or scientific sounding names and ingredients that promise to turn the clock back 20 years effortlessly.  I received this 90 second wrinkle reducer with great skepticism especially after seeing the not so inexpensive price. Doing some research on the active ingredients, including  Matrixyl 3000 which one web site touted as recommended by the trusted Dr. Oz, little information was found, except for the obligatory before and after photos, including one post claiming an 80 something granny reversed 20 years of her aging using this ingredient.  The Dr Oz web site came up with no search results or referenced opinion regarding this ingredient,  Matrixyl 3000. Time to apply it myself.  The instructions advise putting a small skin of the product under and around the eyes and then patting gently fo 90 seconds to &amp;#34;activate&amp;#34; the ingredients. To my surprise, after following the directions and applying the cream around the fine lines surrounding the eyes, there was a small but noticeable smoothing of the skin. I quickly add, it felt as if there was a stiff starch on those areas. It seems logical to me that patting skin anywhere has the effect of increasing blood flow there and causing a slight plumping as a result. I speculate that after this plumping results, the product solidifies, holding the surface area in that more taunt attitude. The results were neither dramatic nor long lasting, so it remains to the purchaser to decide if this degree of temporary difference is worth the price. I gave it 3 stars also considering the price vs effect. As all things in life, the maxim holds true that if something sounds too good to be true.........things in life, the maxim holds true that if something sounds too good to be true.........</li>
    <li> This really works.  I can feel it tighten the skin where I apply it.  I save it for when I go out and want to look my best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I do not like the container.  Push down to softly and nothing comes out.  Push down too hard and too much comes out!  I hate to waste it so it&#x27;s a big hassle for me when I use it.  Takes more time than I would like to get it out of the container but the end product does make my skin look less wrinkly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sad to say that this is another snake oil being peddled to women with hopes that some cream/ lotion will turn back the hands of time.  I do not have a lot of wrinkles, but a tiny bit on the outer corners of my eyes, and a couple of shallow lines across my forehead.  I was excited to try this product to see if I could get an even more youthful appearance.  But unfortunately I must report that I saw absolutely no difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Simply put, this is Spackle for your face! It works GREAT! I applied it and went out and was carded (I am 51) because I looked 25 years younger!! My son said I looked just like my photo&#x27;s taken in the 80&#x27;s!!&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution, if you apply Hydroxatone 90 Second Wrinkle Reducer to your fine lines, make sure to put concealer or foundation over it, as it turns a powdery white otherwise.</li>
    <li> Or at least for me it mattered. The first time I tried it, I didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference. I patted it gently on just like my usual eye cream. I was ready to give this product 2 stars. However, the directions that come with it say to apply it with a \\&quot;sweeping\\&quot; motion. I guess this form of application smoothes the product more into the fine lines because I tried it this way the very next day and noticed a difference immediately. I am only 33 and have a few fine lines around my eyes from smiling. Nothing deep, so I&#x27;m not sure if it works on deep wrinkles or not. I also tried crinkling my eyes a few minutes later when I smiled to see if the fine lines would reappear, and they didn&#x27;t! The product does wear off as the day goes on, but it is pretty awesome for most of the day. I put this product on over my face cream. Also, the dispenser is indeed poorly made. It dispenses way too much cream even if you barely push it down. I use the extra on my forehead, but I would rather not have extra since it is so pricey. I am really happy with this product, though.</li>
    <li> I have some crows feet and some fine lines around my mouth and on my forehead that I was hoping this product would help minimize.  I don&#x27;t know if I was expecting too much, but I came away disappointed.  First of all, the pump that it comes in does not work very well at all.  The first time I used it, I had to pump about four times before anything came out, and when it did, a big glop shot out all over my hand and wrist.  Since there is such a small amount in the tube, I was upset that so much was wasted.  Then, when I applied it, I did not notice much of a difference in the appearance of my fine lines.  It seemed to work the best around my mouth, but it was not a drastic difference.  My eyes and forehead looked pretty much the same as before applying it.  I felt the \\&quot;tightening\\&quot; effect on my face, but there really was not a large change in my appearance.  I was pretty disappointed.  I will probably use this product occasionally but I know not to expect much from it.</li>
    <li> First off - read the instructions and don&#x27;t expect miracles.  This is just a topical serum; it is not a permanent solution.  HYDROXATONE 90 SECOND WRINKLE REDUCER will not erase deeply etched lines in your face or dark, droopy bags from under your eyes.  It will however, for a while, reduce under eye puffiness and firm up those fine little laugh lines.  HYDROXATONE 90 SECOND WRINKLE REDUCER works by tightening up puffy skin and fine wrinkles.  It also contains \\&quot;optically advanced light-diffusing ingredients\\&quot; (whatever those are) which reflect and diffuse the light around your eyes, giving you (temporarily) a brighter, more youthful glow (something that Hollywood has been doing with movie makeup for years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does HYDROXATONE 90 SECOND WRINKLE REDUCE last for 8 hours?  Honestly, I am not sure. After tapping in a small amount and then waiting for about 90 seconds, my morning puffiness is definitely reduced.  I can see a distinct difference.  I also feel more awake, because of the skin tightening around my eyes.  Psychologically, do I feel better because I look better, or do I look better because I feel better?  Who knows?  However, the puffiness is reduced and I feel more awake.  Which is a definite plus.  But I can&#x27;t tell you if it lasts 8 hours, because after two hours or so of being awake, my normal morning puffies are gone anyway.  So maybe it just gives me an early morning advantage.  I&#x27;ll take it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had none of the issues with the pump that others have experienced. Works just fine for me each time.  You only need a very small amount, so the small bottle lasts a long time, which is important considering the price.  It has not irritated my skin and seems fairly gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you need an extra early morning pick-me-up in your beauty routine, then HYDROXATONE 90 SECOND WRINKLE REDUCE is worth a try.</li>
    <li> You know how you read something that sounds too good to be true?  After using this product, the description provided would fall into that category - somewhat.  It did improve bags under my eye to a small degree but it did not make any noticeable difference on small wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the directions exactly provided the best benefits.  How do I know this?  Because after following them (using 1 pump of the product and applying by patting it on only) and getting lackluster results, I was thinking that using more lotion or layering it on would provide better results.  Not even close, the results of not following the directions were pretty scary with more (fake) wrinkles being produced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried using this 3 times with the same results: no visible reduction of wrinkles yet a slight reduction of puffiness under the eyes.  The price listed does not encourage me to buy this as a under the eye fix.  I will stick to a more expensive product that produces better results ([[ASIN:B000VUUUV8 Freeze 24/7 Eye Serum]]).</li>
    <li> Squirt. Squirt. Squirt. I had no problems with getting the wrinkle reducer formula out of the container as it seems other reviewers had, but, most important, I did have a problem with the actual results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter how much I squirted, I dabbed the product around my eyes and the only change that I detected was a subtle layer of white residue around my eyes. Perhaps this is what the manufacturer meant by \\&quot;reducing the look of under eye bags.\\&quot; But, no thanks, my other brand of make-up concealer is much cheaper and looks way better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tightening feel of the product does have a positive psychological effect and one would expect good results, but, in the end, my crow&#x27;s feet and lines appeared the same. I would have loved even a temporary skin softening effect, but came up with nil. I would never buy this product even if it were half the price; and I had such high hopes. Oh well, back to the drawing board trying to defy the impending aging process. Ugh, just the thought of it makes me feel old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stacy Lytwyn, Marketing Guru/Motivational Speaker/Journalist&lt;br /&gt;Author: CONSUMMATE CONNECTICUT: DAY TRIPS WITH PANACHE</li>
