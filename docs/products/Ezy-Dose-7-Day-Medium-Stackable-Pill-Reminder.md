      <li>A nice size for vitamins.</li>
      <li>It would have been nice to be able to specify your preference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>colorful, compact, and handy!</li>
      <li>I ended up using free sauce containers from my husband&#x27;s cafeteria!</li>
      <li>Love Ezy Dose Stackables....</li>
      <li>I really like these pill bottles, but it would be great if they were made of a more resilient plastic.</li>
      <li>And they were free!</li>
      <li>I take herbal supplements which require me to take them more than 3 times a day, which is what most pill compartments allow for.  </li>
      <li>Love concept.  </li>
      <li>I just wish they held up better.</li>
      <li>A great way y to keep a week&#x27;s supply of  prescription pills ready for the day.  </li>
      <li>I have been using pill holders like these for about a year (from the container store) and love them.</li>
      <li>The ones that I had purchased in a store many years ago lasted for years.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Every Sunday I fill 3 of these for morning, noon, bed :)</li>
      <li>I love these.  </li>
      <li>This is a good product but it is quite large.  </li>
      <li>does the job, I did do the light oil wipe around the top to try and get them to screw together</li>
      <li>and I take more pills than will fit in the medium.</li>
      <li>Like many others have said, the quality is CHEAP.</li>
      <li>But they get fissures on the side and crack easily.</li>
      <li>No stickers with days of the week but easy problem to overcome.  </li>
      <li>These stackables are made of cheaper plastic &amp; dont thread easily.</li>
      <li>My wife has put labels on each of the separate sections for easy identification.</li>
      <li>Also easy to remember which ones are taken.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>These break easy.</li>
      <li>The compartments screw together, but not well, so it&#x27;s easy to get them out of line</li>
      <li>I ordered a Med size and boy what I got was Huge...</li>
      <li>I still don&#x27;t think this product is worth more than $5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The cheap, self adhesive labels don&#x27;t adhere well and lift off while sitting on the shelf.</li>
      <li>so I can now fit all needed supplements in  1 section.</li>
      <li>Makes sorting pills more fun.</li>
      <li>They are very portable which makes them handy for travelling.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t screw together smoothly, which makes using this item more bother than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>Thanks!!!</li>
      <li>Even though this kind of tall, I can separate into 3 and 4 day sections that fit easily in a purse and the screw top wiil not open.  </li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s still a less than ideal happening.  </li>
      <li>It is nice to be able to travel with just enough sections as I need.</li>
      <li>Each &amp;#34;day&amp;#34; container is roomy for many or large pills.  </li>
      <li>Still and all, it&#x27;s such a good idea, I keep buying replacements on Amazon Prime.  </li>
      <li>Shipped quickly though, no complaints about the seller.</li>
      <li>Unless you need to put 10 of more pills a day into the case, the smaller version is a better bet.  </li>
      <li>Luckily at those times, they were contained.  </li>
      <li>They are a little challenging at times to get screwed on correctly but more importantly, these should be labeled Monday to Sunday!  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t let the pretty colors sway you!</li>
      <li>It fits 8 vitamins (including big ones like my fish oil and calcium), and has room for more!  </li>
      <li>The old fashioned \\&quot;Locking Pill Reminder\\&quot; is definitely a better choice.</li>
      <li>It is definitely useful and convenient.  </li>
      <li>The medium pill stacker has plenty of room and is colorful.</li>
      <li>They should have come with their own lids to have the option of using them individually.</li>
      <li>the nice thing is that they give you 2 extra lids for the containers and you don&#x27;t have to carry that bulky 7day tablet box that is one piece seven days and takes up a lot of room in your purse or pocket.</li>
      <li>I bought them to use as a camp spice container, but I think they are too big for backpacking and more for car camping... mostly because they aren&#x27;t totally waterproof and because they break too easy.</li>
      <li>and they are just the right size to pop into my bag when I go out to eat.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s also great that it comes with an extra lid, i take it apart for how many days i&#x27;ll be on a trip and put the lid on that half of it.</li>
      <li>It will make traveling with a couple of days worth of pills so much easier!</li>
      <li>The container is clear, so you can easily see the contents.</li>
      <li>I probably could have gone a size smaller, but this will be great when I&#x27;m traveling and can double up on my days.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I ordered the smaller one and it is the perfect size for a few pills a day.</li>
      <li>I bought this item, and I am satisfied with it, however, I am returning it for the smaller pill organizer.</li>
      <li>You can probably fit two of those soft chewables in addition to fish oil, calcium, multi, and others.  </li>
      <li>If I don&#x27;t find a higher quality option or if the container breaks before I can find an alternative,</li>
      <li>The medium size holds about 8-10 capsules, and is pretty sturdy.  </li>
      <li>or you take more than seven different things.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping that with use the modules will open and close with greater ease.  </li>
      <li>This one is just right ... and the threads are bigger than the \\&quot;small\\&quot; size and that makes it easy to screw the parts together repeatedly without breaking the threads.</li>
      <li>(And that is purely for the convenience [and size]</li>
      <li>These round pill holders do not twist nor untwist smoothly to stack; they are brittle and break easily also.&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
      <li>Just what I was looking for, and the extra lid is a super bonus!  </li>
      <li>I really like the convenience they offer.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>If you had to really use them as they were intended-as a pill dispenser, you would spill everything everytime</li>
      <li>It worked really well too, thank you reviewers.  </li>
      <li>This is a must have if you travel much.</li>
      <li>So you can stock this thing up and get rid of medicine bottle clutter, and you can just drop the whole thing in your suitcase when</li>
      <li>local store stopped carrying the smaller size of these that I liked.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have always hated pill organizers because I don&#x27;t (yet) need the daily dose reminders and the little S/M/T/W/Th/F/S things don&#x27;t hold enough anyway to be worthwhile.  But by the same token I hate having a bunch of bottles around.  This gadget lets you put all your meds in one place (you can color code by med, e.g., Nexium in the purple compartment), and the medium size is big enough to hold a 30-day supply of everything, unless your pills are really big or you take more than seven different things.  So you can stock this thing up and get rid of medicine bottle clutter, and you can just drop the whole thing in your suitcase when you travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that it is poorly made.  The compartments screw together, but not well, so it&#x27;s easy to get them out of line and then they either come apart or crack.  And if you drop the thing, you&#x27;re toast.  At least part of it will invariably crack or break apart altogether.  Still and all, it&#x27;s such a good idea, I keep buying replacements on Amazon Prime.  Been using them a couple of years now, and am on my fourth . . .</li>
    <li> I had a smaller tower but needed the medium sized tower to help remind me to give myself my daily Forteo injections.  The needles I use for the injections fit perfectly in each receptical.  I also followed the advice of some reviewers and rubbed a little vaseline around the treads to help make the opening and closing easier.  It worked really well too, thank you reviewers.  No stickers with days of the week but easy problem to overcome.  I just used a permanent marker to label the days of the week and just have to touch them up if necessary.  When one has a variety of medications taken different ways, it is challenging to come up with ways to remind oneself about taking them--or at least it does with me.  This solved my problem.</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed in this product. Their were no individual lids and they were very difficult to pry apart. If you had to really use them as they were intended-as a pill dispenser, you would spill everything everytime you opened them! They should have come with their own lids to have the option of using them individually. I ended up using free sauce containers from my husband&#x27;s cafeteria! They worked great! And they were free!</li>
    <li> Bigger than I expected, and pretty cheaply made. It takes some effort to get the layers to screw together correctly. Shipped quickly though, no complaints about the seller.</li>
    <li> to resolve the threading difficulty/breakage problem i used a little vaseline, applied with a Q-tip, around the threads.  works great.</li>
    <li> i love the way this looks! some people have complained that it cracks when you tighten each section, but i read someone&#x27;s review that says to lube up the threads with vaseline and that will fix that problem. so when i got mine i did that and it works perfectly! i use mine for eight vitamin size pills and there&#x27;s room for maybe tweleve total in each level. it&#x27;s also great that it comes with an extra lid, i take it apart for how many days i&#x27;ll be on a trip and put the lid on that half of it. great purchase!</li>
    <li> I love these.  I use them for other things too (i.e., sewing items and other small items which otherwise are too easy to lose.</li>
    <li> Item is as described, but took a little longer to get here than expected, but still not too bad - about a week as I recall.</li>
    <li> This is a must have if you travel much. The size allows you to keep an larger number of different pills all in the same container. Keeps you from having to carry multiple bottles. My wife has put labels on each of the separate sections for easy identification. Never have had a challenge going through customs.</li>
    <li> The threads utilized to screw the sections together are very prone to cross threading. Also unless the threads are lubricated ( I use dry soap) they  &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; and require excessive force to assemble which aggravates the tendency to cross threads and strip out.</li>
    <li> I bought this item, and I am satisfied with it, however, I am returning it for the smaller pill organizer. I read reviews on the small one, and people said it barely held anything, so I ordered the medium.    The medium is the size of what I expected the large pill organizer to be.    Nothing wrong with it, I was just looking for a more travel-friendly size, so I will be ordering the small.    But the product looks good! :]</li>
    <li> local store stopped carrying the smaller size of these that I liked.  Got larger size so I can now fit all needed supplements in  1 section.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the pretty colors sway you! While the concept may seem good, the product is of poor quality. Doesn&#x27;t screw together smoothly, which makes using this item more bother than it&#x27;s worth. The cheap, self adhesive labels don&#x27;t adhere well and lift off while sitting on the shelf. The extra cap cannot be attached, when not in use, and can easily become misplaced. The old fashioned \\&quot;Locking Pill Reminder\\&quot; is definitely a better choice.</li>
    <li> Lids not interchangeable</li>
    <li> Great Design, but the plastice is too brittle...  The perfect size for about 15 pills a day.  You must be very careful screwing the lids back on, because the plastic is very brittle.</li>
    <li> Had a smaller one that would not hold vitamins and meds, just happen to see this larger size and it works for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and transaction...Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> A great way y to keep a week&#x27;s supply of  prescription pills ready for the day.  Medium is plenty big for up to 15 pills of varying size.</li>
    <li> I was impressed with the durability of this item.  Each &amp;#34;day&amp;#34; container is roomy for many or large pills.  The container is clear, so you can easily see the contents.</li>
    <li> These round pill holders do not twist nor untwist smoothly to stack; they are brittle and break easily also.&lt;br /&gt;Made in china explains it all!</li>
    <li> Looked everywhere for this size. Only found the small ones. This size is big enough to hold all of my vitamins.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t remember where I purchased this item, but is the same thing that I have.  Mine came with one extra lid which worked out when one broke or when I wanted to use just one of the containers.   I take supplements and I like to just fill each container with a different supplement and each day I pick up this container and open each one instead of searching through bottles in the drawer.  Also easy to remember which ones are taken.  I label them with stick on labels so I don&#x27;t forget what they are.  Also some of mine were contrary to open and I put a little vegetable oil around the edge with a q tip.  Bought one for my mom and she also uses hers.  One thing I didn&#x27;t like.  If you repurchase to add on or replace a broken container be careful to purchase the same brand and size.  Even same sizes in different brands do not fit.</li>
    <li> I take a lot of vitamins, some are large chewables and this holds them all perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Great to take on trips too since you can just unscrew and carry only the days you need.&lt;br /&gt;Every Sunday I fill 3 of these for morning, noon, bed :)</li>
    <li> These  are great.  They help me remind me to take my pills and they are just the right size to pop into my bag when I go out to eat.&lt;br /&gt;I just wish that there was a size smaller than the small one.  I take just 3 pills before breakfast.</li>
    <li> I like these. I bought them to use as a camp spice container, but I think they are too big for backpacking and more for car camping... mostly because they aren&#x27;t totally waterproof and because they break too easy. I wish these could fit my daily pills, but I&#x27;m a sick person and I take more pills than will fit in the medium. I will have to get the large for pills and the small for spices ;)</li>
    <li> **Original 12/2010**&lt;br /&gt;This may be a tough rating (1-star), but I think that the quality of this product can be found in the dollar store.  If it were $5 or under, I&#x27;d improve it&#x27;s rating.  (And if it were $1, I&#x27;d give it 5-stars.)  As others have said, the threading is not high quality and the plastic is thin.  It&#x27;s definitely not worth $10.  I was sent the all-clear variety instead of the colors, which I would have preferred.  It would have been nice to be able to specify your preference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are pros to this product, though, and I&#x27;m not going to return it.  It is definitely useful and convenient.  It fits 8 vitamins (including big ones like my fish oil and calcium), and has room for more!  You can probably fit two of those soft chewables in addition to fish oil, calcium, multi, and others.  I probably could have gone a size smaller, but this will be great when I&#x27;m traveling and can double up on my days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE 10/2012**&lt;br /&gt;I just improved my rating a little to 2-stars (If I could do 2.5, I would).  I still don&#x27;t think this product is worth more than $5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple years now, and it has held up.  I&#x27;ve dropped it on a ceramic tile floor, and while the container popped open and all of my vitamins spilled over the floor and under the fridge (ugh!), there were only cracks on the containers and chips off of the screw-top threading.  The container now looks like it has a stained glass look since there are cracks ALL over it.  So why would I improve the rating after this?  Well, the containers still screw together and they didn&#x27;t actually shatter.  I suspect they will break, though, after another tumble or two, but I was pleasantly surprised!  I should also add that the containers have become disconnected on other occasions... in my suitcase.  Luckily at those times, they were contained.  But it&#x27;s still a less than ideal happening.  The threads aren&#x27;t high quality.  You need to be extra careful thatyou have all of the threads alined and twist the container tightly -- but not too tightly (or it will crack).  I think it might be an art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One additional piece of advice... the containers are NOT WATERPROOF.  I took it camping and threw it in the cooler on the drive up (thinking back, I don&#x27;t know why did that!) and let&#x27;s just say that it was rather disgusting cleaning out the vitamins.  I will never do that again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of this said, I&#x27;m looking for another manufacturer of the stackable containers.  I really like the convenience they offer.  I can fill up the entire container for a week, but only take one with me daily instead of the entire stack.  That, to me, is awesome.  If I don&#x27;t find a higher quality option or if the container breaks before I can find an alternative, I *might* buy another one.  But I&#x27;m a little stubborn and will only do that if I absolutely have to!  (And that is purely for the convenience [and size] it provides.)</li>
    <li> Love concept.  I bought 5.  Edges broke off.  Now have 2 complete sets.  Would not buy again!</li>
    <li> I keep my mom&#x27;s pills in these and it works out perfectly.</li>
    <li> I had been using the small. The medium pill stacker has plenty of room and is colorful. Makes sorting pills more fun.</li>
    <li> This is a good product but it is quite large.  Unless you need to put 10 of more pills a day into the case, the smaller version is a better bet.  I ordered the smaller one and it is the perfect size for a few pills a day. This thing is big!!!!!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for, and the extra lid is a super bonus!  It will make traveling with a couple of days worth of pills so much easier!</li>
    <li> Like many others have said, the quality is CHEAP. They started cracking and breaking on day ONE! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> The perfect medication containers for travel are a \\&quot;holy grail.\\&quot;  My quest goes on, but this product is satisfactory pinch-hitter.  I used several sets on a 3-week trip and the system is an improvement  over schlepping a couple dozen of pill bottles.  The threads on the stackables are somewhat balky.  I&#x27;m hoping that with use the modules will open and close with greater ease.  I&#x27;m pleased with this product, but will continue my search for an ideal solution.</li>
    <li> They are a little challenging at times to get screwed on correctly but more importantly, these should be labeled Monday to Sunday!  I read a review about having stick on labels but mine didn&#x27;t come with those so I wrote the days on them with a sharpie, problem solved but I shouldn&#x27;t have to do that.  But man the medium holds a ton!</li>
    <li> We use these everyday for my med&#x27;s.  They are great as they are color coded and can be use to identify what day you are taking.</li>
    <li> I have been using pill holders like these for about a year (from the container store) and love them. These stackables are made of cheaper plastic &amp; dont thread easily. Dont waste your money</li>
    <li> Practical, and I like the colors.</li>
    <li> A nice size for vitamins. I put 8 different vitamins in each with room to spare. I have a little trouble putting it together. The threads aren&#x27;t great.</li>
    <li> Mu husband uses a lot of daily vitamins and instead of taking multiple jars on vacation he transfers them to this very useful product.</li>
    <li> These look great. But they get fissures on the side and crack easily. They also take some effort to lime them up to close currently. They are great for organizing. I just wish they held up better.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Extra lid came cracked in the center, but still fully functional. Perfect travel size, medium stacker holds 12 large vitamins in each container, but holds up to 20. I would give it 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t come with the extra cracked lid. These are the best pill organizers I&#x27;ve ever seen!</li>
    <li> They are pill caddies, how bad can they be.</li>
    <li> I use a separate little container for breakfast and another for dinner, and the small,  not these mediums, are just what I need.  The word medium shown here, misled me.  So I advise you to check out the diameter measurement and compare it to your needs, so you know what you are getting.</li>
    <li> I bought these to replace the smaller sized stackable pill bottles I had been using.  These pill bottles are well sized, and allow for lots of vitamins and pills.  I like that they are see through since I can see at a glance if I took my pills that day or not.  They are very portable which makes them handy for travelling.  The only problem that I have with them is that the plastic is a bit brittle which makes them subject to cracking and chipping.  As a matter of fact, two of the segments and one of the lids were broken when I took them out of the box.  I didn&#x27;t bother to ask for replacements because after having the smaller versions of the product, I knew what to expect.  They are not especially fragile, they just don&#x27;t handle bumps and impacts all that well.  I had used the smaller versions for more than 10 years, so I expect that these will last at least that long in spite of the inevitable chips and dings.  I really like these pill bottles, but it would be great if they were made of a more resilient plastic.</li>
    <li> These break easy. The ones that I had purchased in a store many years ago lasted for years. These get dropped a few times and the edges crack or break off.</li>
    <li> I like the color coding for days of the week.  I have blue for Monday, green for Tuesday, yellow for Wednesday, orange for Thursday, red for Friday, purple for Saturday and clear for Sunday.  I have it sitting on bathroom sink so always remember to take my meds.  Last one I had was just a bit smaller, this one is a little big but serves the purpose well.</li>
    <li> Love Ezy Dose Stackables....colorful, compact, and handy!</li>
    <li> I like the screw tops on these compared to the flip tops on other daily pill containers.  Flip tops unsnap in my purse spilling pills all over.  Even though this kind of tall, I can separate into 3 and 4 day sections that fit easily in a purse and the screw top wiil not open.  I fill it once a week. They usually last 2 or 3 years for my daily usage.  If you drop them too much the hard plastic may crack or  splinter.  You can throw away a broken section and keep using the others to get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> It is nice to be able to travel with just enough sections as I need. Good way to organize medications and supplements. so far has held up well in my travel bag.</li>
    <li> My second purchase of these. Perfect for morning or evening meds for a week. Like having a little added color to my day.</li>
    <li> I choose this Product due to I have a lot meds I take and I like that it is stackable also I like that you can take one of the containers put on the lid and pop it in your purse  the nice thing is that they give you 2 extra lids for the containers and you don&#x27;t have to carry that bulky 7day tablet box that is one piece seven days and takes up a lot of room in your purse or pocket. I would recommend this to anyone who takes a lot of pills and likes to go out and needs to have their medications with them.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 containers and sort my pills once every 2 weeks.  I can detach a container and bring it with me too.</li>
    <li> I take herbal supplements which require me to take them more than 3 times a day, which is what most pill compartments allow for.  Before bed I fill up a compartment corresponding with each time to take the pills, and throw it in my purse.  The medium size holds about 8-10 capsules, and is pretty sturdy.  The only negative thing is that the threading on the compartments is very easy to get off kilter and make it annoying to try and screw them together.</li>
    <li> Like almost everything manufactured in China, the threads suck, but at least it&#x27;s better than the usual tubes I used to buy in the fishing depts, which now, also made in China, contain lead so can&#x27;t use for meds. Think I&#x27;m going to open a store called &amp;#34;NOT made in China!&amp;#34; where the hardware doesn&#x27;t strip, the mugs don&#x27;t contain lead, and everything actually works!</li>
    <li> does the job, I did do the light oil wipe around the top to try and get them to screw together easier....seemed to help.</li>
    <li> I ordered a Med size and boy what I got was Huge... Still it is good quility and the only thing missing was stickers for the days of the week.  I will be a repeat customer..</li>
    <li> Just what my wife wanted.  The small circular pill boxes.&lt;br /&gt;She like these Ezy Dose 7 Day Small Stackable Pill Reminder boxes. Thanks</li>
    <li> Good Size for Pills plus Vitamins/Supplements, The smaller size was way to small and the large was way, way too large. This one is just right ... and the threads are bigger than the \\&quot;small\\&quot; size and that makes it easy to screw the parts together repeatedly without breaking the threads. I use this every day and it works great.</li>
