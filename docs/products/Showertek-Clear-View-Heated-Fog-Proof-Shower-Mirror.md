### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great customer service!</li>
      <li>Very good product for the price.</li>
      <li>This is a product that needs to be on the market and has a great need.  </li>
      <li>That worked great.</li>
      <li>They took a great product and cheapened it up to the level of junk.  </li>
      <li>Works great if you want to shave or wash your face in the shower and see what you are doing.</li>
      <li>Looks good and works.</li>
      <li>All in all a good product.</li>
      <li>NOW I&#x27;M OUT MONEY AND STILL DON&#x27;T HAVE A GOOD SHOWER MIRROR TO SHAVE WITH...</li>
      <li>the fog free element is excellent</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m dissapointed because I really liked the one I had years ago.</li>
      <li>and my wife is thrilled that it won&#x27;t ever fall down/off the wall &amp; even the razor stays put.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had great success with them.  </li>
      <li>Also, it looks much better.  </li>
      <li>Easy to install</li>
      <li>It was easy to install and never fogs up.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to install</li>
      <li>I was excited to get this, but upon installation realized that my joy wouldn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br</li>
      <li>(Maybe it&#x27;s something special with our tile, but suction cups never stay on our walls)  </li>
      <li>I live in Texas, where water is a precious resource, so it is great to be able to cut down on the water coming out of the main shower while I shave my head and</li>
      <li>I know this item was dicontinued hence the lower price but at $20 it&#x27;s definitely worth it to me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a Showertek mirror for many years (the original crappy-looking white ones) and managed to scrape the (plastic) mirror until it was unusable.  </li>
      <li>This is my second Showertek, and I love it.</li>
      <li>and I may try one more time hoping that it was just a defective product, or I may see if there is a similar product out there.</li>
      <li>the weight of the mirror and arm is more than the connector can handle, so it constantly rotates to hang toward the floor.&lt;br /&gt;- even when you set it to NO water</li>
      <li>It lasted exactly 8 months before snapping apart.  </li>
      <li>works better than my old one larger view and fog free</li>
      <li>After having two prior versions of the Showertek shower mirrors, I was excited to try this one.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>This new model is bulky and it fell apart while being installed.  </li>
      <li>After close to 15 years with the original ShowerTek white plastic mirror, I finally decided to upgrade to this chrome plated baby.  </li>
      <li>(If you&#x27;re expecting it to be as clear as when you are standing at a mirror over a sink, ain&#x27;t gonna happen.)</li>
      <li>The vendor kindly refunded me for this poorly designed item.</li>
      <li>but I have trouble getting it in the right position.</li>
      <li>Reviews were right...very thin material that broke easily upon install.</li>
      <li>But still the only real fog-less mirror on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Mirror started to get black spots developing on the edges after a year or so of use.</li>
      <li>Leaks a little bit at the button to flow water into the mirror for fogfree feature but doesnt really matter to me.</li>

<li> It is too bad that this product is so poorly made.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s just as bad.</li>

    <li> After having two prior versions of the Showertek shower mirrors, I was excited to try this one.  I&#x27;ve always had great success with them.  Unfortunately, this one did not work for me. After several attempts the water was still leaking from the place in the product (where the hose meets the attachment - not where the threads are), and the button to shut the water off to the mirror made a minimal difference.  Water was always coming out of the mirror.  Also, the knob to affect the water going to the shower head seems to work minimally.  I returned this one and I may try one more time hoping that it was just a defective product, or I may see if there is a similar product out there.</li>
    <li> Very good product for the price. Leaks a little bit at the button to flow water into the mirror for fogfree feature but doesnt really matter to me. Easy to install</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Showertek mirror for many years (the original crappy-looking white ones) and managed to scrape the (plastic) mirror until it was unusable.  No such problem with this item.  The mirror is glass, so no scratches from the cleaning pad that I stupidly ruined the previous one with.  Also, it looks much better.  My plan is to never be without one of these in my home.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this, but upon installation realized that my joy wouldn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t fog in the shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;- junky plastic connector seems impossible to get tight on the shower faucet without breaking it&lt;br /&gt;- the weight of the mirror and arm is more than the connector can handle, so it constantly rotates to hang toward the floor.&lt;br /&gt;- even when you set it to NO water is coming through the mirror, it SEVERELY decreases shower water pressure.  This was a deal breaker!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently this this is disconnected and leaning against the wall of the shower.  I hold it in one had when I shower, just like I would any other mirror.  It needs to go in the trash.</li>
    <li> I know this item was dicontinued hence the lower price but at $20 it&#x27;s definitely worth it to me. Looks good and works.</li>
    <li> I had one of these that lasted me 7-8 years. Recently ordered another to replace it and it leaked and would not stay in place. I sent feedback to the seller and they sent me another at no cost. It&#x27;s just as bad. I&#x27;m dissapointed because I really liked the one I had years ago. They must have cheapened it up somehow.</li>
    <li> worked fine for the first month but after that leaked from hose really annoying so now just leave it in the shower unpluged</li>
    <li> My wife got me this for Christmas.  It is still in the shower and I haven&#x27;t nicked myself.  Water does drip/run down it as another reviewer wrote, but with no effect on the water pressure and it stays clear.  (If you&#x27;re expecting it to be as clear as when you are standing at a mirror over a sink, ain&#x27;t gonna happen.) It&#x27;s easy to install and my wife is thrilled that it won&#x27;t ever fall down/off the wall &amp; even the razor stays put.  (Maybe it&#x27;s something special with our tile, but suction cups never stay on our walls)  It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> After close to 15 years with the original ShowerTek white plastic mirror, I finally decided to upgrade to this chrome plated baby.  It lasted exactly 8 months before snapping apart.  I should have listened to the reviews. They took a great product and cheapened it up to the level of junk.  What a shame.  I am buying other products now to try some other option for no-fog shaving in the shower.</li>
    <li> the fog free element is excellent but I have trouble getting it in the right position. Wants to drift down a little keeping in mind I am a tall guy. All in all a good product. Received a defective product the first time and they replaced it without any trouble or me having to send back the broken one. Great customer service!</li>
    <li> Not happy at all, shower head leaks water every where and it is so heavy it won&#x27;t stay where you set it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t ever buy this.  The fittings leak!  That is why this item is discontinued.  Don&#x27;t spend your money on this.  Went to the garbage the same day I got it.</li>
    <li> It is too bad that this product is so poorly made.  This is a product that needs to be on the market and has a great need.  Nothing but leaks and problems.  I returned it and was issued a refund, but I would prefer a working product.</li>
    <li> Leaky leaky leaky. But still the only real fog-less mirror on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Mirror started to get black spots developing on the edges after a year or so of use.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who loves to shave in the shower. It was easy to install and never fogs up. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> HI,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I PURCHASED THIS MIRROR TO USE IN MY SHOWER AND IT LEAKED ALL OVER THE PLACE. I CALLED THE COMPANY AND THEY TOLD ME IT WAS A DISCONTINUED ITEM AND THEY COULDN&#x27;T HELP ME, SO NOW I&#x27;M OUT MONEY AND STILL DON&#x27;T HAVE A GOOD SHOWER MIRROR TO SHAVE WITH...</li>
    <li> This is my second Showertek, and I love it. I live in Texas, where water is a precious resource, so it is great to be able to cut down on the water coming out of the main shower while I shave my head and face.&lt;br /&gt;I have read other reviews about low water flow, but that has not been a problem for me with ether Showertek.</li>
    <li> The way it&#x27;s heated is a little water form the shower passes through and warms the mirror. That worked great. The big problem is, the water is restricted for the shower. There is about a 1/8&amp;#34; hole for the shower water to pass through.</li>
    <li> I had an older model mirror that was small and efficient.  This new model is bulky and it fell apart while being installed.  The vendor kindly refunded me for this poorly designed item.</li>
    <li> Works great if you want to shave or wash your face in the shower and see what you are doing.</li>
    <li> Reviews were right...very thin material that broke easily upon install. No opportunity to repair due to construction, so ended up throwing it away. Used to be much better quality...really sad to see the decline!</li>
    <li> works better than my old one larger view and fog free&lt;br /&gt;the bypass button leaks a little but not enough to worry about</li>
