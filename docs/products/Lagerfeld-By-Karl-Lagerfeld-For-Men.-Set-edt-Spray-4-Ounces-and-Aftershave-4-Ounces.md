      <li>I bought this product as a gift and pleased to find a decent price on Amazon, considering Lagerfeld is somewhat hard to find.  </li>

<li> This Lagerfeld is my husbands favorite, but it&#x27;s not easy to find in stores anymore, at least in my area!  </li>
<li> Also, like all quality aftershaves/colognes..it lasts a long time on the skin and seems to &amp;#34;deepen&amp;#34; in character with time and body heat.  </li>
<li> like this gift set as you get two larger bottles, one is after shave and the other is the cologne.  </li>
<li> Well not really,</li>

<li> any other cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> all much less topped off with the cologne.  </li>
<li> and I am sorry that I can only buy it off the internet.</li>
<li> This review is based on the recepient of the gift.he has been using this fragrance for decades.since relocating,has been almost impossible to find especially the aftershave,he stands by this product.it smells good,not overpowering</li>
<li> I WAS ELATED WHEN I FOUND IT ONLINE ONLY TO BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THE AFTERSHAVE.</li>
<li> ALSO THE FORMULATION IS TOO THIN, MAKING IT DIFFICULT</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Everything was as expected, and the price was great.  I look forward to futher purchases here.  thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I started wearing this cologne 35 years ago and my wife loves it.  If I put on anything else she tells me to go back to Lagerfeld.  She even buys it for me and stocks up so I cannot run out of it.  I like the fragrance and apparently so do women.  I get more compliments while wearing Lagerfeld than any other cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this gift set as you get two larger bottles, one is after shave and the other is the cologne.  This is a good buy and sometimes this product is hard to find in the stores.  I recommend this cologne to you and I am sure my wife would also recommend it!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my son.  As this is one of his top two favorite colognes, I almost couldn&#x27;t go wrong.  The after shave and cologne set made it all the better as I also purchased some DE wet shaving equipment for him to try as well.  He was very impressed by it all much less topped off with the cologne.  Really fast shipping as well.</li>
    <li> i really thought that the scent of the aftershave spray would have a hint of &#x27;Lagerfeld&#x27;, however i am still trying to detect it.  cologne was and is excellent...</li>
    <li> My Dad loves Lagerfeld.  I also wear it too.  It&#x27;s a great unisex fragrance.  You can&#x27;t find this in stores any more. This is a great fragrance and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a gift and pleased to find a decent price on Amazon, considering Lagerfeld is somewhat hard to find.  The receipient was very pleased.</li>
    <li> Lagerfeld has been my favorite after shave and cologne for years and I can no longer find it in stores, so I am very happy that I can get it through Amazon.  Not only is it available and delivered promptly, but the price is lower than what I remember being able to buy it for even years ago.</li>
    <li> I have used Lagerfeld products for many years and I am sorry that I can only buy it off the internet. [[ASIN:B000JK6IP2 Lagerfeld By Karl Lagerfeld Mens After Shave 4.2 Oz - Fragrance]] I will continue to use it as long as it&#x27;s available</li>
    <li> THE QUALITY OF THE AFTERSHAVE IS NOT UP TO THE STANDARD OF THE LANGERFELD  AFTERSHAVE I HAVE PURCHASED IN THE PAST (MANY YEARS AGO). IT, RATHER THAN SOOTHING THE SKIN, IT STINGS. ALSO THE FORMULATION IS TOO THIN, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO APPLY.&lt;br /&gt;I USED LANGERFELD FOR MANY YEARS UNTIL IT NO LONGER WAS AVAILABLE IN THIS MARKET. I WAS ELATED WHEN I FOUND IT ONLINE ONLY TO BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THE AFTERSHAVE.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and good pricing.  I was pleased with product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance and my wife likes &amp;#34;Lagerfeld&amp;#34;  best.</li>
    <li> Well not really, but this smells a lot nicer than the AXE products (the ones where innocent users are attacked by salacious women).  Not overwhelming, I appreciate its slight floral essence, sweet but not flowery.  This is a 180-degree departure from musky scents, which works well for business and evening wear.</li>
    <li> My Father is disabled and my 21 year old nephew recently suffered an incident which left him paralyzed. I wanted to give them something special for Christmas and hopefully make them feel a little better. This present was ideal. They love the cologne and even though they have to deal with very difficult situations which limit their ability to enjoy many things, the scent reminds them there still are things they can enjoy. I am very thankful to give both some pleasure. Great quality product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> love the way it smells, the only thing my husband wears.and i like the smell on him. . .  .</li>
    <li> This review is based on the recepient of the gift.he has been using this fragrance for decades.since relocating,has been almost impossible to find especially the aftershave,he stands by this product.it smells good,not overpowering and it lasts.has gotten many compliments \\&quot;YOU SMELL GOOD\\&quot;,what are you wearing?Thanks Amazon for a great product.continue to carry it,for i am sure i will be shipping again in the future to my dear friend.HE LOVES IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> He always only wants this cologne for his birthday, fathers day and Christmas. I try to give him other things but all he ever wants is this cologne.</li>
    <li> Have used Lagerfeld for years, but could, and still cannot find in stores.  Was really glad to have found it @ Amazon and am once again enjoying wearing this Fragrance.</li>
    <li> Excellent service... no delays.  My husband&#x27;s favorite scent is&lt;br /&gt;not always easy to find although he has used it for several&lt;br /&gt;years.  Ordering was quick and convenient.</li>
    <li> We have been buying Lagerfeld for 20 years. It smells so good on my husband. I love this colon on him. we don&#x27;t buy anything else.</li>
    <li> This Lagerfeld is my husbands favorite, but it&#x27;s not easy to find in stores anymore, at least in my area!
