      <li>/&gt;Quite pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone!</li>

      <li>The razor can be cleaned under warm water with soap.</li>
      <li>I spend another 3 minutes trying in vain to shave these areas, but they often remain rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, everything else about this shaver is nice.</li>
      <li>At ~$160 for the top of the line wet/dry Braun, it just seemed to be a deal too good to miss.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Pretty good shaver.  Like the self cleaning feature.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this shaver. Gets a a nice close shave with little to no irrational. My neck usually gets bad razor burn and was lucky if I could shave twice a week without it being very painful. I can shave every day with the shaver easily. Never thought it&#x27;d be possible.</li>
    <li> Seems very well made but delivers a poor quality shave.  I&#x27;ve had much better shaves from a $40 cheapo than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Wow!!!!! That&#x27;s all I say is wow. I bought this for my husband and he loves it. I recommend this to all the men&#x27;s out there I know its kinda pricey but it worth a spend. Thank you so much</li>
    <li> Fabulous shaver. Much gentler on the neck compared to rotary shavers.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t provide a full review as there are already a number of excellent reviews submitted.  I would however like to clarify how the razor works when a person travels without the clean and charge station.  The Braun 799, when connected directly to the power cord, will not operate.  That is, the shaver will not operate as a shaver.  It will however charge the shaver.  Therefor, when traveling, one must simply remember to keep the shaver sufficiently charged ahead of needing it for actually shaving.</li>
    <li> Great shaver, but over priced.  The higher price for the wet usage option is not worth the extra cost.  If I had it to do over again, I would purchase the shaver but without this option.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver!</li>
    <li> ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE EVER HAD&lt;br /&gt;WOULD BUY IT AGAIN IF I HAD TO......</li>
    <li> My third Braun and they keep getting better.  Absolutely the fastest, smoothist and most comfortable shave.  A great product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, and provides close comfortable shaves.  It is a little pricey, but worth it.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver.  No issues.  Buy extra cleaning fluid.</li>
    <li> I have the series right below this one, and I can tell this works much better. Not sure why, but I seem to have  a closer shave</li>
    <li> Update I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for around a year now, give or take. I&#x27;m still delighted with it. A few updates: -  * I neglected to mention that it took no time at all to get used to shaving with this device. It was comfortable from the off. * When traveling on business on one occasion, I forgot my shaver, but fortunately I keep a Gillette Mach 3 complete with a new blade in my traveling kit, so was able to compare the results again. I was surprised to find how much I preferred the Braun shaver over the razor. It was much more comfortable and the shave seemed closer, too. * I have altered my routine slightly. I typically just run it under a hot faucet before I shave after washing my face with hot water. This gives great results. * The cleaning fluid lasts forever now. I replaced the last container after around three months and could have used it for longer. * It seems like I take a little longer to shave now, but that&#x27;s probably because I am obsessing about getting the closest shave possible. The results really are excellent, but I should probably lighten up a little. :) * It&#x27;s a really excellent shaver and I recently bought my Dad one as a present.  *****************  I used a top of the line (dry shave only) Braun for several years twenty years ago with good results before switching to a wet/dry Panasonic until around 2001. I can&#x27;t remember why I stopped using the latter, but for at least ten years I had been perfectly content with my daily routine of shaving twice with a Gillette Mach 3, once with the grain and then against the grain. I found that the Mach 3 worked better than the Fusion for this and I managed to get ultra-close results with little irritation and only occasional cuts - so why go back to electric? But then I lucked out when a local department store decided to stop selling electric shavers and sold their remaining stock at deep discounts. At ~$160 for the top of the line wet/dry Braun, it just seemed to be a deal too good to miss.  I&#x27;ve been using my Braun 799cc for the last 6 months and have been very pleased with the results - this really is an excellent shave, even in comparison with my manual routine. I find that I get approximately the same level of closeness (manual against-the-grain shaving is arguably marginally keener, but the difference is negligible at best) with no cuts, no irritation, and less hassle. And I can shave before going out in the evening, too, without removing my shirt.  My routine with the Braun is pretty simple. I do a dry shave to &amp;#34;prepare the field&amp;#34; and then soak my face with hot water for a few seconds before performing a wet shave to get amazingly close results. This approach requires no gel at all - I can only imagine that gel would get in the way - and the time cost seems insignificant. For me, the additional wet cycle makes a significant difference in closeness and I expect that this is what sets this model apart from the 790cc.  Cleaning the shaver is straightforward. My routine for this is to remove the foil and rinse it out, dry brush any remaining stubble off the head, and then run a full cleaning cycle. This is almost certainly overkill, but it doesn&#x27;t take more than a minute or so and I have found that the cleaning solution lasts for a very long time (two months or so?) this way. Also, when I experimented by running this procedure in reverse (rinsing with water following a cleaning cycle) a little stubble was still washed out of the foil, so mine seems to be the most thorough method. Finally, when I&#x27;m traveling without the base, this approach allows me to keep the shaver very clean regardless of the hygiene level indicated in the LCD display (which appears to be based solely on the number of shaves since the last cleaning cycle.)  Time-wise, it&#x27;s probably a wash between my old double-manual procedure and my new somewhat elaborate routine, but initial preparation and cleanup is certainly reduced, so on balance I probably save some time due to the reduced hassle.  I can&#x27;t say how this compares to the top of the line equivalent Phillips or Panasonic models, but it&#x27;s hard to imagine that they can be significantly better than my Braun. In any case, I&#x27;d buy it again without hesitation - even at full price.</li>
    <li> This is one of the TOP OF THE LINE electric shavers on the market and I&#x27;m struggling getting a good clean shave out of it.  My skin is also sensitive. I&#x27;ve shaved dry and I&#x27;ve shaved with sensitive shaving gel. At times the shaver beats my face up (the usual cuts) and I find myself shaving areas over and over again.  Even after shaving it seems that I have a five O clock shadow.  I called BRAUN and talk to a representative and I was mailed a new shaver head. It hasn&#x27;t changed my shaver experience.  So either this shaver isn&#x27;t for me or I&#x27;m doing SOMETHING wrong.  I expect an electric shaver to be the best smooth shave I can possibly get...with or without shaving foam.  If somebody can point out to me a good way to use this shaver...method, etc. I&#x27;m open to ideas.  I just don&#x27;t feel as if this shaver really shaves all that well.</li>
    <li> Okay, I tried this razor for a week. Thought I was pretty happy with it, but I decided to try my manual razor on half my face and this on the other half. This does no shave as close, mainly on the neck. This razor can not get the hair that grow in curves, I also push really hard and go ove it and over it in every direction posilble; therefore, I would say if you are any bit picky, save your money. Also does leave razor burn.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve long used rotary razors ever since I had a crappy experience with a foil razor as a teen. Let me tell you that I&#x27;ve been missing out for years. This razor does a great job on both short stubble and longer hair (shaved up to 5 day growth with no problems). I use this razor to shave my whole head regularly. I use this in the shower and because it is waterproof I have no problems getting a full wet-shave every morning in about 30mins. The shave quality is by far the closest shave I&#x27;ve gotten from an electric razor and I have not had much razor burn at all even on the highest power settings. It handles both my coarse facial hair (sometimes feels like mowing a forest down) and my very fine scalp hair with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before this I had a Norelco SensoTouch 3D rotary but since they recently completely ruined the replacement head design I decided it was time for a change. Totally happy I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint that I can think of is that the long-hair blade in the center does not go all the way to the edge of the razor (about 1/4&amp;#34; in on both sides), so it can be difficult to shave longer hair in tight areas (such as on top of ear or right up next to a goatee). But that&#x27;s where the flip-up trimmer comes in handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone! Even the cleaning base seems like much better quality than I&#x27;ve seen before. Not sure if they recently changed the head design on this but I have not had a single snagged hair such as other reviewers have complained about with this razor series.</li>
    <li> quality shows every time. along with a hefty price.</li>
    <li> Overall this is a solid razor. I had a Panasonic with a cleaning station for the last two years that I was never really happy with, it finally died &amp; two years is not long in the world or razors. Prior to that I had a Braun with the cleaning station that lasted about 7 years so I decided to go back to Braun. It shaves better than the Panasonic but the pop up trimmer is a bit of a let down. I prefer a straight edge and this is round as I have a small beard &amp; find it hard to trim the base of the beard straight. Over all the unit is good construction, the cleaning station really is the best, the razor smells so clean and sanitized when it&#x27;s done, it far outdoes the Panasonic on that front. The Panasonic razor was very good, but I have to push the Braun ahead as it shaves closer in my opinion and the cleaning station crushes the competition. (The Panasonic cleaning station requires a lot of cleaning out the reservoir of gunk but the Braun is a disposable cartridge &amp; is alcohol based for sanitation &amp; has a clean smell when finished).</li>
    <li> The was a time that you couldn&#x27;t convince me that an electric shaved could satisfy me, However since purchasing this shaver, I have had a change of heart. I am very impressed with my new Braun shaver. The best electric shave I have ever experienced and the cleaning station works phenomenally. Wonderful piece of technology!</li>
    <li> Great shave would be nice if the battery life was longer.</li>
    <li> simply the best shaver.</li>
    <li> Excellent electric shaver. It&#x27;s hard to get used to using water &amp; shaving gel with such a unit, but the results are just as close a shave as you get with a multi blade manual shaving device razor, like I have been using for years.</li>
    <li> Excellent electric shaver. I absolutely hated electric shavers til I decided to go all out on a top of the line model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Waterproof&lt;br /&gt;-Great for sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;-Razor close shave&lt;br /&gt;-No rouge missed hairs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weak points:&lt;br /&gt;-Need to replace cleaning solution every month (only lasts 8 weeks if not used daily)&lt;br /&gt;-Need to replace cutter foil at least every 18 months (foil usually gets weaker quicker if used daily)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the model down (790cc) for about half the price, it has everything the same except the waterproofing for around half the price. Works great with non foam shaving cream. Still cheaper and safer than using a blade for shaving in the long run.</li>
    <li> Target sells the 797cc model, which is identical as far as I can tell, for more than $100 cheaper. Great upgrade to the 790cc at a reasonable cost. I highly recommend if a foil cutter is what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> I received a Norleco electric shaver for Christmas this year. It was OK but I was disappointed with its overall shave and comfort level. I returned it and, after much research, replaced it with this Braun. This shaver gives a good shave dry, a very good shave with Lectric Shave, and an excellent shave wet with foam or gel. I have no irritation and the shave is close and comfortable. Of course it&#x27;s not as close as a razor, but is damn good and does not leave me bleeding or with irritated skin.  It&#x27;s also way more convenient than a blade. I&#x27;ve been using a Gillette Fusion Power razor for years, which is excellent but very expensive, and switched to the top of the line Dollar Shave club razor for the last year, which isn&#x27;t that great but it is inexpensive. I wanted something that was easy, quick, and convenient and this fits the bill. The cleaning station is also good and keeps the razor clean, charged and ready to go. The battery stays charged for at least a week of traveling (haven&#x27;t tested any longer). If you are looking for a very good and comfortable shave, look no further. I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> The Braun Series 7 is a reliable great shaver. I have shaved dry and wet with soap and water for the last three months using the Braun Series 7.Wet and dry are fine with the wet shave taking a little longer. I can get a very close shave wet but it does take some getting used to. You must learn the contours of your face and the direction of the grain of your hair. The cleaning system works well and charges the razor as well. All in all a great product</li>
    <li> Over the years I have purchased a number of electric shavers.  Until now, I felt the Panasonic Wet &amp; Dry was the best one on the market but, NOT any more.  The Braun 799c-6WD &amp;#34;hands down&amp;#34; is the BEST YOU CAN BUY!  Yes it&#x27;s a little expensive however, you get what you pay for.  As they say in the instruction, stick with it a few days until your beard gets use to it.  I mostly use it with shaving lather (The Art of Shaving Cream is fantastic) but, a few days a week I&#x27;ll use Lab Series Electric Shave Solutions which works well too!  I do feel with the cream my beard does not grow back as fast but, maybe that&#x27;s just me?  So, I highly recommend the Braun 799c if you are in the market for an electric shaver that does what it says.  With the 30-60 day money back promise, &amp;#34;what do you have to lose?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> A definite step up from the 790cc [[ASIN:B003YJAZZ4 Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Silver]] for wet shaving; I&#x27;ve waited for years for Braun to produce a 7-series wet/dry shaver - I purchased from BB&amp;B before Amazon had it available.  Some time back I switched from the 790cc to the Panasonic ES-LV81 [[ASIN:B005DKKBP6 Panasonic ES-LV81-K Arc 5 Mens Electric Shaver with Cleaning System]] just because of the wet shave - I very much prefer shaving with a gel for the comfort and smooth shave, and always needed a pre-shave lotion with the Braun to dry shave.  The Braun 799cc does not disappoint, and is a solid upgrade by Braun.  All the positive aspects of the 790cc PLUS the benefit of a wet shave; except for differences noted, identical in all respects to the 790cc in function and appearance.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the Panasonic ES-LV81 and the previous Braun 790cc, both companies&#x27; top of the line shavers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pluses&lt;br /&gt;- Much smaller head than the Panasonic (same head as the 790cc); this is a plus for maneuverability and being able to see where you&#x27;re going.  The large head of the Panny was a minus for some, but I found it covered a larger area quicker, although visibility was limited in some tight spots under the nose and sideburns.  Both have the ability to lock the head at an angle for more precise cutting; the Braun mechanism seems a more solid lock.&lt;br /&gt;- Superior cleaning system to the Panasonic; the Braun alcohol cleaner does a much better job of sanitizing and cleaning than the soap and water-based cleaner of the Panasonic, and smells better.  The automatic cleaning cycle is also much shorter - a couple of minutes of buzzing instead of 10 or 15, and the drying cycle in the Braun is induction, so is completely silent, and lasts for maybe 15 minutes, unlike the running fan of the Panasonic which lasts for over an hour and is not quiet.  Your sleeping partner will appreciate that.&lt;br /&gt;- Wet shave - this is a biggie for me; a vast improvement over the Braun 790cc; less irritation, smoother shave.&lt;br /&gt;- In my experience the Braun cartridge heads last longer than the separate foil/cutter head of the Panasonic, and are cheaper to replace (less than half the cost).&lt;br /&gt;- Charging time is shorter than the Panasonic from partial discharge, which may mean (haven&#x27;t tested it) that you get more shaves from a single charge.  Both use Li-Ion batteries, so will work pretty much full power until the battery&#x27;s out.&lt;br /&gt;- Smooth, glossy external finish on the hard shell (not the rubber back) compared to the more matte finish of the 790cc, which should be more effective at repelling soap film and debris.&lt;br /&gt;- The famous blue night light of the 790cc is gone.  The on/off switch light of the previous Braun would stay on after charging, and was bright enough to light a room.  On the 799cc, all the lights go out shortly after charging is complete.  This might be a minus if you actually used it for a night light....&lt;br /&gt;- A minor thing, but the 799cc comes with a quality, fitted hard leather case, great for travel, compared to the chintzy faux-leather soft vinyl case of the Panasonic.  This always seemed to me a rather piddling cost saving measure from Panasonic, for a shaver once listed at a stratospheric $600, and probably why they supply a plastic head cover for it.  Robust Western Teutonic engineering, I suppose, compared to practical Eastern.  There is a new model of the Panasonic (ES-LV95) for 2014, looks very similar to the old one, with a slightly modified cleaning system (still detergent).  Current retail is around $450; haven&#x27;t tried it, but I would expect performance to be similar to the older Panasonic (same foil/cutters).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minuses&lt;br /&gt;- Not as close a shave as the Panasonic; I think Braun uses nickel alloy steel in their cutter blades compared to the stainless steel of the Panasonic, if that matters, but the shave of the Panny is somewhat closer than the Braun; both are acceptably close.  Using a gel results in a much closer shave with the 799cc than with the 790cc dry though, for me, and is much less irritating.  The 799cc and 790cc are somewhat noisier than the higher frequency Panasonic in operation, due partly to the vibrating \\&quot;Pulsonic\\&quot; feature of the Braun head I think, which actually does produce a closer shave than the older Braun technology.&lt;br /&gt;- Cleaning station cartridges are more expensive with the Brauns (about $20 for three months with daily use, compared to Panasonic cartridges at a little over $10 for three months).  This is somewhat offset by the fact that for the Panasonic, you really need to use distilled water in the cleaning station, and even with that you still have a soap film buildup on cleaner and shaver.  The Braun cartridges are a little more convenient than the Panasonic - you don&#x27;t need to fill up a water reservoir when replacing a cartridge.  Any of the shavers (Panasonic or Braun) can be used without the cleaning stations (the heads or shavers can be washed), but I use the station just for the convenience and because it does a better job of sanitizing the shaver, particularly for the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;- Strictly a cordless shaver, unlike the 790cc; you can&#x27;t run it plugged in.  This is common to all wet shavers, a trait shared with the Panny, for obvious safety and liability reasons (think \\&quot;zzzaaaap\\&quot; in the shower - yes, somebody would shave with the shaver plugged in, or over the sink with a wet shaver).  If you run out of juice or have a low charge, you have to charge it first before shaving, instead of just using it as a corded razor, but charging time is quick.  The 799cc does have a cord connector in the back, and you can charge it with the cord (without the cleaning station) while traveling, for example.  It has a different shaped wall plug than the 790cc, with a different stock number, but specifications seem to be the same - 100-240v/ac, 12v/dc, 7w/0.4A, and not waterproof (the plug).  Either plug type fits the Clean and Renew stations for either Braun shaver, and the cleaning stations seem identical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great shaver and a great shave, and worth the upgrade from the 790cc if you prefer a wet shave. If you&#x27;re a Panasonic user, the differences are described; the major advantages to me are the superior Braun cleaning system, the cheaper and longer lasting cutter head, and actually not mentioned, the more solid build and feel of the Braun compared to the Panasonic - but definitely subjective; sort of like a comparison between BMW and Lexus. If you shave dry, this will be identical to the 790cc, which right now is over $50 cheaper (on Amazon - less difference elsewhere, but cheaper) so don&#x27;t bother switching.  Some folks do wet shave with the 790cc (you can rinse the head); not a good idea since it wasn&#x27;t designed for it, but it&#x27;s a free country.  Other than the head, the 790cc&#x27;s internals are not waterproof; the 799cc on the other hand is completely sealed and submersible, so no worries.  A VERY bad idea to use the 790cc wet and plugged in with the cord, so if you shave with gel or foam and like the Braun system, the 799cc is the razor to get.el results in a much closer shave with the 799cc than with the 790cc dry though, for me, and is much less irritating.

    <li> I have never been able to use an electric razor - my beard has always been too much for them to handle. I&#x27;ve been a blade &amp; shave cream guy all my adult life. Now that I&#x27;m retired, I found myself skipping a day - or two - of shaving, much to my wife&#x27;s consternation, because it&#x27;s just too much hassle to shave every day (yeah, I know, I&#x27;ve gotten lazy). So, I thought maybe I could use an electric razor in between so I don&#x27;t look so grizzled. I did my research, and this razor kept getting raves. &amp;#34;Yeah, but can it handle MY beard?&amp;#34; I decided to give it a shot - and it&#x27;s great! No, it&#x27;s not quite as close as a blade, but gets me smooth enough for daily life. For those special dress-up occasions, I still use a blade &amp; shave gel, but I&#x27;m delighted to have this alternative in between. Oh, and I love the automatic cleaning! I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:c7e81927d21cec80facd9ff263b727ff]] I have purchased many electric shavers over the past years. I shave everyday and I am somewhat of a perfectionist. I ended up buying a Safety Razor because no electric razor came close to the shaving experience of old fashioned shaving. Until now of course. This comes 97% close to be exact. You can&#x27;t possibly get as closer shave as the safety razors, which takes much longer and requires some skills. I can gurantee that no other electric shavers can come close to this BRAUN shaver. I don&#x27;t mind spending money for the best product and i did do that over the years. I have tried the Philips Norelco 1290X, Panasonic ES-LV81-K. This BRAUN series 7 is by far the best. The Norelco came close, but it irritated my skin like many other people. The panasonic was pretty good, but not as good as this one. I love this so much, i haven&#x27;t used my safety razor since i bought this a month ago. I always do extensive research before buying my shavers, toothbrushes or other electronics. Trust me you won&#x27;t regret getting this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets get to the key points:&lt;br /&gt;*From my experience of trying out various high priced electric shavers, this shaver gives the closest shave&lt;br /&gt;*It never once came close to irritating my skin&lt;br /&gt;*THE BEST CLEANING SYSTEM EVER, it feels like im using a new shaver every time and the lemon smell is great. some people complain about expensive cleaning sollution replacement, but its only aobut $5 per container and it lasts two months. You can make it last 6 months if you open the head and let the hair fall out before cleaning and close the plastic lid of the container after using it, so it won&#x27;t evaporate.&lt;br /&gt;*Three modes for people who has sensative skin or sensative areas.&lt;br /&gt;*2 year warranty-great customer service&lt;br /&gt;*The replacement head is cheap - it is only $30 and you need to replace every 18 months&lt;br /&gt;*Battery life is good, i usually put it in the cleaning station after use, which charges as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seriously did not find one thing wrong with it, very satisfied with it and i will probably use this for the next 5 years, unless a new breakthrouh happens in electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: i purchased this from ebay because I was lucky to win a bid.iously did not find one thing wrong with it, very satisfied with it and i will probably use this for the next 5 years, unless a new breakthrouh happens in electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: i purchased this from ebay because I was lucky to win a bid.</li>
    <li> I choose this the Braun Series shavers as I have used them in the past.  I decided on this model because the write up was closest to the type beard I have and so far it has lived up to it stated performance.  I have used Braun products for 30 + years and like the quality of the product.  This product has met all of my expectations.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers since puberty. I finally replaced my old Braun 7505 with this 799cc. The new model shaves much faster than the old one because it cuts more hairs per swipe. I have a thin and angular face. I can shave most of my face in 2 minutes. However, both this and my old shaver fail to shave certain areas closely: the edge of my jawline, a patch on my throat, that little strip that connects the mustache to the beard, and the dimples in my cheeks. I spend another 3 minutes trying in vain to shave these areas, but they often remain rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, everything else about this shaver is nice. I know that Braun is trying to extract more money from me with the cleaning fluid ($8 per cartridge!!). But the cleaning system really works. I figure I can rinse the shaver in the sink daily and use the cleaning system weekly.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product, i didn&#x27;t know an electric razor could shave as well as a blade.</li>
    <li> Best electric razor that I have had so far.</li>
    <li> So I investigated this as much as I could as my previous Norelco just broke. I have had the Braun Series 7 previously (a few years back) and while I liked it - the cleaning machine broke and I just gravitated towards the Philips. I wanted to see if the Series 7 had been updated during the past few years (like maybe a series 8 or 9) but short of that I found out that Braun released the Series 7 - 799cc - which was now waterproof. That seemed to make a lot of sense since the other major companies also had waterproof models. So I looked here and saw the price was $300 - I then went to Bed, Bath&amp; Beyond and saw that they had it for $249 - but with their 20% discount (which is always easy to find) - the price was under $200 - pretty much the same price that the 790 is selling for. So I received it yesterday and apparently it was a bonus package because they included three clean and dry modules (that fit the cleaning machine). So I am not sure if this is a brand new model or something that Braun is putting out for the holidays - but it seems to be a good deal - especially now that the Series 7 790 (now graduated to the 799) is waterproof!</li>
    <li> I have used Braun shavers for many years.  This is the best.  so many features and they all work well.Great shave and that is most important.</li>
    <li> I never thought I&#x27;d find an electric razor I could count on. I still find myself thinking &amp;#34;boy am&lt;br /&gt;I glad I bought this thing&amp;#34;. My beard has been giving me fits for years. I&#x27;ve tried three or four&lt;br /&gt;types of electric shavers and used all the one, two, three, four, five blade solutions. My beard&lt;br /&gt;laughed at all of them for anything more than one use. With razor blade prices getting beyond&lt;br /&gt;silly this is a great solution.&lt;br /&gt;I have a fast growing thick beard and this is the first razor that&#x27;s worked for me. And it&#x27;s self&lt;br /&gt;cleaning, wow. The self cleaning function works very well as well. While doing reading I found&lt;br /&gt;a suggestion that if you keep the cap for the cleaning solution you can take the tank out of the&lt;br /&gt;base and recap it until you need it again. This works because the solution has alcohol in it. So&lt;br /&gt;keep that in mind if you get one of these. I tried it both ways and it does last a lot longer. One&lt;br /&gt;last comment on cleaning. You need to remove the screen and tap it on the edge of the sink&lt;br /&gt;to get some of the easy to use bits out. This will also help make the solution tanks last longer.&lt;br /&gt;One last tip. They tell you in the paper work that comes with the razor that you need to give your&lt;br /&gt;beard time to adjust to being cut by a different razor. This was really true for me. It took about&lt;br /&gt;two weeks for my beard to start realigning itself.&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t a cheap solution; but it&#x27;s a great one. It really works</li>
    <li> Having taken a 15 year break from electric razors I figured I would give them another try. My previous attempt to use them made my skin hurt when using Various Braun and Norelco razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit skeptical to spend the money to have the discomfort I previously had but figured I would give it a try based on the other stellar reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon receipt, I found it easy to set up. Battery was already fully charged. I had not shaven for two day prions so my first use was a good test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed with how close this razor cuts. It&#x27;s not as close as a brand new disposable razor but very close to it. It did a good job on my neck, easily getting all the hair without leaving any stragglers. It was a dry shave and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. I have sensitive skin and my previous attempts with electric razors resulting in moderate skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning performance of this unit is awesome  it did a very good job after my first shave and is easy to use.  The cleaning process is a bit loud - it sounds like it turns the razor on during the cleaning process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base has a detachable cord. Also included is a traveling case for the razor and a cleaning brush if or the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone you previously tried electric razors 10+ years ago and is wanting to give it another shot.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun shavers for more than 35 years. They are the best and I am very happy with it. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I want to start out by saying that these are all 5 star electric shavers and I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with either of them. For what it&#x27;s worth I&#x27;m a verified purchaser of each one. My face is used to both rotary and foil shavers, and I assure you I have tested each one for 30 days or more to their fullest potential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look and design:&lt;br /&gt;The Braun is less flashy than the other two but still has all the great features. The hygiene meter at the bottom is really a nice touch for anyone who doesn&#x27;t have the base, or does but wants to cut down on solution usage. It&#x27;s very comfortable to hold and&lt;br /&gt;maneuver around your face. The Norelco looks very sleek and has a very nice LCD with all the great features you could ask for. It also feels very natural in the hand and the 3D gimmick, isn&#x27;t as gimmicky as I suspected. We&#x27;ll go more into depth with that later on in shaving performance. Out of the three, the Panasonic is the oddest feeling. This new ES-LV95 is a lot more natural feeling in the hand compared to the slightly older ES-LV81. It&#x27;s still a little top heavy but makes up for it with and amazing new feature I&#x27;ll mention later on below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build quality:&lt;br /&gt;While all three feel very solid and of high quality, the Braun really stands out. All are made out of plastic but the Braun&#x27;s more matte finish personally feels more durable to me. The others by no means feel cheap though. They each have rubbery grips. The grips on the Braun and Panasonic feel more solid and rigid, while the Norelco&#x27;s has a really nice silky feel to it. Each one has good sturdy weight and if had to predict any of them failing on me, I&#x27;m almost positive that in each case, it would be solely mechanical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning:&lt;br /&gt;All three shavers have great cleaning stations that combined with proper care, can result in a shaver that feels like new every time you use it. The cleaning solutions for each one are roughly the same price at around $5 each month. I can&#x27;t fault either one but I feel like the Braun&#x27;s is the best. It&#x27;s fast, quiet, and adds a fresh smell to the shaver. When it comes to manual cleaning, it&#x27;s a completely different story. The Norelco and Panasonic are extremely easy to clean manually with the Norelco being just a little easier. The Braun on the other hand is somewhat of an annoyance. The other two are is simple as holding under the faucet for about a minute and sometimes adding liquid soap. Since the Brauns head is all one piece, you really have to go deep in there with a brush, or hold it under the faucet much longer to give it that same clean. It&#x27;s nothing that would make me say the cleaning system is a must like a lot of others do but it&#x27;s a little extra work for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry shaving:&lt;br /&gt;Yup, it&#x27;s what you&#x27;ve all been waiting for. After months of use between these three shavers I&#x27;m happy to say that they are all great! We&#x27;ll start off with the Braun. It is without a doubt the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had. The Sonic technology really is more than just some fancy selling point. The way it glides over your face feels more like a massage than a shave. The OptiFoil catches every hair and cuts it below the skin, and the ActiveLift gets even the flattest hairs on your neck. This is without a doubt the most innovative shaver since the first electric and you have to respect that it really set the tone for modern day electric shaving. When you see the things Panasonic offers, it&#x27;s easy to write the Braun off but you have to give it credit for being the first truly great electric shaver. Even four years into it&#x27;s life it&#x27;s arguably still the best shaver on the market. Just when you think it&#x27;s about to finally meet it&#x27;s match they come up with a way to make it even better. Now that there are models that support wet shaving, I can&#x27;t think of any reason not to consider it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where the Braun has it&#x27;s shortcomings the Norelco 3D really shines. The 3D heads(like the Braun&#x27;s Sonic technology) is muchmore than just a gimmick. The ability to flex outwards helps give as close of a shave around the neck and jawline as you can get with an electric shaver at the moment. It&#x27;s without a doubt my personal favorite of the three and my main shaver. In the dry shaving area the two foils do get closer on my cheeks, but the difference is very minimal and nothing you can really notice until a few hours later. All shave below the skin for a razor smooth feel but it just seems like the Norelco doesn&#x27;t get as deep since the shadow comes back faster. It&#x27;s also extremely quiet unlike the Braun and Panasonic which sound like chainsaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then we have this brand new Panasonic which manages to be even better than the ES-LV81. It added the Sensor technology which can sense the length of stubble and adjust the speed specifically for each area it goes over. It results in getting an amazingly clean shave with just one or two passes. It doesn&#x27;t feel as comfortable as the Braun but at the end of the day, what does? You can&#x27;t really call it irritating either but you can tell you just got a good shave when you&#x27;re done. The big head makes it hard to get around goatees and sideburns like the Norelco, it just takes time to get used to it. Overall I would say the dry shave is slightly better with the two foil shavers but not enough to persuade your opinion. With the end result being the same your choice is really between the comfort of the Braun, maneuverability of the Norelco, or speed of the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet shaving:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d go more in depth here but not much to say. The Braun and Panasonic give me the exact same shave when wet as they do dry but with a little more comfort. This is where the Norelco really shines though. The wet shave it does is on par with the Braun/Panasonic closeness but combined with amazing comfort and one of the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever had around my neck and jawline with any kind of blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day all three are amazing shavers and neither is a wrong buy. You simply just have to weigh your options. I&#x27;ll probably stick to my Norelco just cause I love rotaries but the Braun and Panasonic shaves are just as good...and even better in some areas. Whatever you choose, you won&#x27;t regret it. Thank you for reading and enjoy your new shaver :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, here&#x27;s a link to the other two I reviewed in case you&#x27;re interested.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GFDRRKC/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_mts_prod_img&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Philips-1280X-47-SensoTouch-Frustration/dp/B006W2SYGM/ref&#x3D;cm_cr-mr-title</li>
    <li> The best close shave I have used. No grabbing on scan and no after feeling that the skin has micro abrasions that you would with a finely tuned pair of barber clippers.</li>
    <li> One ofo the best, if not the best ive tried</li>
    <li> This shaver fully met my expectations.  This is my first experience with this brand.  I switched to this brand due to disappointment with a competitive shaver. I selected this specific model for use in a shower and the shaves are close and effortless.  I had a cleaning system with the competitive brand but stopped using it due to its noise.  The Braun system appears much quieter and has differing levels of cleaning with visual guidance for which to select based on usage.  No disappointments with this product.</li>
    <li> Does not live up to the hype! Glad I was able to return it. Finding the right shaver for your individual needs isn&#x27;t easy. And based on all the reviews I read on this one, it sounded like this was the Mercedes-Benz of shavers. I tried it 3 times, never got a completely clean shave once from it, had to go back and clean up with my old battery operated Wahl each time (which is what I want to upgrade from).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you plan on buying it, make sure you can return it, just in case.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s probably the best mesh razor there is. The trimmer isn&#x27;t the best, and when I first got it, the trimmer wouldn&#x27;t close all the way. After some use it finally started snapping into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all these shavers, the cleaning cartridges dry out really fast. It&#x27;s possible to just cork them each time after use, but not very convenient. Then again, you can probably just pour alcohol in there...</li>
    <li> Best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> I switched from Philishave to Braun Series 7 because I was not longer satiesfied with the old system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On MY face the Series 7 comes with a better result, especially at the throat the result is really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I also love is the handling. The shaver fits comfortably in your hand. And cleaning is finished much faster then with my old Philishave.</li>
    <li> Prior to my purchase of this unique shaver, I had used the panasonic ES-LV81 wet/dry shaver for several years which worked ok but does not give a very close shave, plus the pop up trimmer on the shaver I initially used to facilitate a close shaver stopped working after some months of purchase but I was stuck with it considering the huge amount I paid for it over 400 bucks. However with my switch I am proud to tell every one that this Braun 799cc is the best shaver in the world and yet cost far much less than the panasonics. It&#x27;s a masterpiece from Braun as I&#x27;ve never had a clear smooth &amp; close shave all my shaving years until I switched to this shaver. It&#x27;s cleaning cartridges costs less and does not take so long to self clean like my former panasonic, which is usually noisy &amp; takes forever. It has also got several personalized shave modes to suit every shaver &amp; particularly people like me with very sensitive skin. The pop up trimmer is also awesome &amp; carves sideburns and mustaches as good as barbing clippers. For me &amp; without doubt this is surely the best shaver in the world and a big kudos to Braun for putting so much into this small device. Welldone Braun as I recommend this product to every shaving guy.</li>
    <li> Came from a norelco rotary shaver. Took about two weeks for my stubble to get used to the new style. Once adjusted this is the closest shave I&#x27;ve had from an electric shaver ever. Great buy for the money</li>
    <li> I purchased this top of the line Braun because I owned a Braun model 5570 for the past 12-15 years and it was so good I reasoned the new models would be improved and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed!  The 799 is faster, quieter and shaves closer than my old Braun and the cleaning system effectively cleans and keeps my Braun looking brand new. If you are in the market for a new electric I highly recommend Braun and if you have never used one Braun is the one.</li>
    <li> Husband really enjoys this shaver.  This is the first one he has had so unfortunately no comparison can be made.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Braun shaver for years and this ones beats them all. I love this razor it gives such a close smooth shave you can&#x27;t beat! So far the base unit with the cleansing cartridge is working good no issues on that. The shaver battery lasts a very long time on the medium shave setting about a weeks worth of shaving. I never got any shaver rash/burn that others may report using a electric shaver but I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for going on 20 years now. If you want the Cadillac of shavers get Braun specifically this razor (799) you won&#x27;t be sorry you purchased it. Update 7 Sept 2015: Been using it for a few months and still love it. The cleaning base unit is working good and this thing really hold a charge. I went out of state for a week several times and never needed to charge it once while gone and still had some bars left when I got home. The cleaning cartridge lasts longer if you tap out the razor every few days. That way it doesn&#x27;t fill up with shavings and lasts about 3 weeks longer than normal change out time.</li>
    <li> I purchased as a replacement to my Panasonic shaver.  The Panasonic was not the top of the line model so not exactly an apples to apples comparison but this Braun does such a good job that I believe that I have found a permanent shaver brand.  My first impression of the cleaning system is that it is superior to the Panasonic and this IS an apples to apples comparison because my old Panasonic has the same system as the top of the line Panasonic.  The Panasonic cleaning system is very noisy and takes a good bit of time.  If I shave at night and then use the system, it disturbs the bedroom.  The Braun cleaning system makes an initial sound and then is quiet.</li>
    <li> I have an older series of this, not the wet/dry version. Used this shaver 2 times thus far and like the shave. I have a very sensitive face and can&#x27;t shave every day. I also need to dry shave with a regular razor after the electric. Although this currently gets a nice close shave, I still need to complete by using reg razor. My face is still getting accustomed to this shaver but so far I like the purchase.</li>
    <li> I had an electric shaver in college. A typical $50 shaver that I received as a gift and I kept it in my car. It basically gave me an acceptable shave if I was late or forgot to shave and needed to. Since college, for the past 10 years, Ive used exclusively the Mach 3 Razors, hot water, shaving cream, etc, always going for the closest shave possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive grown tired of paying out the nose for the Mach 3 blades, at roughly $2.00 per head, they last about a week at best, Ive been paying roughly $110/year on blades for 12 years. Crazy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I thought when I bought this razor, which is nearly $300, it better live up to its reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put... Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my first shave, running my hands both up and down my cheeks... Its as smooth as skin with no hair at all. Shaving was totally comfortable, even on the &amp;#34;Tough&amp;#34; setting. No snags, pinched, pulls.  And this was a dry shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it does take a bit longer than a razor shave... Or perhaps I just need to get more used to it. But I am totally impressed. Looking forward to seeing how it handles a wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade lasts 18 months. You can take it with you. Fully charged it is good for roughly 40-50 shaves. Wow.  No need for a charger on vacations. It has a self cleaning base. Its ergonomic. The head tilts across your face as you move it around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So impressed that I might just shave my whole body... Just to see how it does. Ok no, maybe not... But if you are on the fence about spending $300 bucks on a razor. Just do it. It rocks.</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver I have ever had.</li>
    <li> I have owned this shaver for a month now and shave every other day. As a little background, I have very sensitive skin and have struggled with finding a sufficient shaver to combat that. I have a specific criteria. I need a shaver that does not irritate my skin, gets a very close shave, and shaves easily. I previously used the Gilette Fusion Proglide. That is a great shaver. Very close shave. However, I was experiencing razor burn on my neck with that. I tried a cheap norelcco and it left my face red and tender. So, I turned to google and researched all kinds of shavers. It boiled down to the Sensotouch 3d and the Braun 799cc. I ultimately chose this one because of the foil cutter. The way it contours to the curves of the neck is very natural and effective. I immediately went to Target and purchased it.  Pros: -Easy to hold (comfortable) -Glides over skin -Satisfying noise to let you know the hairs are being cut -Very close shave with absolutely no irritation whatsoever. (Very important) -Wet and dry -Works wonderfully wet or dry! -Cleaning system is a huge help and is VERY convenient -You just pop the shaver into the cleaning base and it makes the shaver feel, look, and SMELL new! -Charges either in the cleaning base or with cord -Battery lasts a VERY long time! -Sturdy and easy to use precision trimmer  Cons: -Cleaning base is large on my counter. (not a huge deal) -Pricey startup cost. -New foil and cutters are a bit expensive, BUT only need to be bought every 18 months.  I could not recommend this shaver more. It is expensive. I found it for $199 at Target so give that a go if you can! I would have easily paid $350 for it though. The benefit of having a close shave with no irritation is priceless. You cannot put a price on your skin. The Braun 799cc will give you the most comfortable shave you could possibly get. Buy it and you will not be disappointed.  Tip: -Remove clean and renew cartridge from base after each use to make it last longer! And you really only need to use it every 3 or 4 times you shave.</li>
    <li> I found the Braun to be a bit nosier than my previous Norelco.The Braun does a good job on the long hairs on the neck</li>
    <li> The best you can buy!</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing.  I have a very angular face with a beard that grows in every direction. Electric shavers in the past were HORRIBLE which included Panasonic, Phillps, Philco, Remmington, etc.  THE BRAUN was absolutely awesome shave. I literally shaved, dry, normally as I would any single blade razor ( using the same stroking directions).  About  4 minutes later, my face was smooth as a baby&#x27;s _ _ _.  1) this razor is designed to shave wet or dry.  Wet shave using gel, goes faster but faster than 4 minutes. Why do the clean up if you don&#x27;t have to 2) I have a friend who is a biochemist. I asked him to analyze the cleaning solution so I did not have to pay the outrageous $20.00 a cartridge cleaning fee.The following productions is what he found in the  Braun Cleaning solution:  WATER, ALCOHOL, VINEGAR, AMMONIA, MOUTH WASH. Use equal amounts of each. Go to the 99 cents or Dollar Store and buy them. The Braun cleaning solution also comes with lubercants mixed in. If you make your own cleaning solution just get  LIGHT MACHINE OIL, put a drop on  your finger and run it along the foil. VOILA!  I highly recommend this saver.</li>
    <li> Great shaver, it shaves closer than the Panasonic 3d shaver, the built in cleaning system is awesome and cleans the head of the shaver great</li>
    <li> Got the &amp;#34;frustration free packaging&amp;#34; instead of the &amp;#34;retail packaging&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have owned the Panasonic for about a year - a fine shaver.  5 blades, long battery life, easy to use and clean.  The Panasonic is a great shaver, and it shaves close and clean - wet or dry.  That said, the Braun, which I have had about a week, is simply better in every way.  It shaves a bit closer.  It is easier to hold and the head is smaller.  Due to its vibration (pulsonic) feature, it glides over the face.  The charging station is easy to use and totally cleans the unit after each shave.  If you are looking for the top shaver, this it.  If you are on the fence about spending this much money on a shaver, well consider that you spend quality time with it just about every day.  This shaver can replace your traditional blade and foam shave.  Shaves great wet or dry.  A quality piece of equipment that you will enjoy owning and using.  Strongly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought the Braun 799CC after using a Norelco SensorTouch 3D 1250x for three years. The Norelco gave a very good shave, actually the best wet/dry electric shave I&#x27;d had up to that point, but recently Norelco changed the design of the replacement head and the new head is nowhere near as good. In fact, it&#x27;s terrible. You can read all about it on Amazon under the RQ12+ and RQ12/52 replacement head model numbers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucky me -- the Braun 799CC is actually much better than the Norelco SensorTouch 3D 1250x, even with the old head. The shave is much closer and my beard grows back more evenly. The cleaning system is better and the travel case is, too. While I&#x27;m very disappointed that Norelco made me flush my $220 investment down the drain, in a sense I&#x27;m glad they did because I&#x27;ve found a much better shaver in the Braun 799CC. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 55 years old, used several different electric razors over my lifetime and this Braun Series 7 799CC-6WD is the best razor on the market, even out performing my old Brawn which lasted almost 10 years in smoothness and closeness. There&#x27;s no perfect razor but this model is the closet to perfection.</li>
    <li> Braun Series 7 799CC-6WD CC4 WET &amp; Dry Shaver is best Shaver i every had.</li>
    <li> Husband has had this razor for 2 years. He loves it. perfect for me on the go we&#x27;r and dry shave</li>
    <li> I got this for about 238$. while the normal one (not wet and dry) costs about 200$. I don&#x27;t find 40$ justifies the benefits so if it is not important I would recommend to get the normal one over the web-and-dry one.&lt;br /&gt;Also, when I shave sometimes very small areas are left with tiny short hair that I need to go over back and forth a few times before I get them to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;The tiny trimmer seems useful but I feel it is a bit weak. It doesn&#x27;t do the work &amp;#34;strongly&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;effectively&amp;#34; as I would expect. But it does its job anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I like this for shaving and I thought I would have more options to style my beard with this one but I didn&#x27;t find it provide much styles as I was imagining.</li>
    <li> Had a Braun about 5 years ago and for at least 8 years before that; switched to Panasonic, because I wanted a wet shave, for closeness; Ultimately still wasn&#x27;t satisfied, so after about 3 years and one warranty repair, switched to the Norelco 3D.  Had it 18 months, went to replace the head and can&#x27;t find it, and the prices are outrageous .  Re-grouped and bought this Braun, had it one week.  It&#x27;s Great, highly recommend, very smooth, close, not irritating; gave a smooth close shave with a thin layer of &amp;#34;American Crew Shave Cream&amp;#34; from Ulta. Strong quality, powerful shave, easy ergonomics, quality travel case and I travel weekly!  Thanks Bruan for making a great shave better, with W&amp;D and quality workmanship</li>
    <li> Nobody sold this type of razor in Myrtle Beach SC, best price by at least $60.00 +. Perfect, quite, &amp; real smooth.</li>
    <li> My friend loved the shaver. It shaves really good, and cleans itself. Although, you have to use lotion, as it dries your skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I like using it very much. Only thing I wasn&#x27;t used to is the packaging being different but at least it was easier to open and the product appears to be new. Also, it&#x27;s about $35 cheaper on the Target website right now.</li>
    <li> I have owned this shaver for approximately two weeks now, it replaces my old Wahl Triple Play rotary shaver. The Wahl shaver is fine but does not give a very close shave. Moreover, going back and forth over the same spot over and over gets tiresome and gives me irritation. I decided to go all-out and get the Braun Series 7 because the reviews were marked so high on it. Plus, I have owned a Braun Oral-B toothbrush set for the past five years and it has performed wonderfully so I thought I&#x27;d try their electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I like...&lt;br /&gt;a) Even at the intensive shave setting, I do not get irritation. I generally use the sensitive mode on my neck and intensive mode on my face. No irritation whereas my last foil shaver, a Wahl Bump-Free series, would leave my skin red and irritated. Thus far I have not had any irritation and I shave every day.&lt;br /&gt;b) The cleaning station is very easy to setup and use; it does exactly what it says it does. I drop the shaver in the cleaning station after I&#x27;m done shaving and it gets a bath and charge automatically.&lt;br /&gt;c) The razor itself is very well-built, nothing cheap or squeaky about it. It feels solid, like a tool.&lt;br /&gt;d) It&#x27;s relatively quiet for a foil razor.&lt;br /&gt;e) Blades don&#x27;t need to be replaced for 18+ months.&lt;br /&gt;f) The cleaning solution smells like lemons and is not obnoxious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things it came with...&lt;br /&gt;- Electric Razor (err...Shaver)&lt;br /&gt;- Charging cord&lt;br /&gt;- Cleaning station&lt;br /&gt;- Cleaning brush&lt;br /&gt;- Solution tray&lt;br /&gt;- Carrying case (a nice one, btw.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is made in Germany, the base station in Hungary. The power cord is coiled and can be plugged into either the shaver directly or the cleaning station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to note...&lt;br /&gt;- You do not need to use the cleaning station daily, or at all. The razor can be cleaned under warm water with soap. The manual recommends using non-abrasive soap and applying mineral oil once a week if this is how you will normally clean it.&lt;br /&gt;- Be extra careful opening the cleaning solution if you plan on using it. There are numerous warnings, I was fine but I can see how someone might spill it on the first try. The lid just pulls completely off and goes in the base, and the base closes over it.&lt;br /&gt;- The cleaning solution is advertised as lasting for approximately 30 cycles, and the manual recommends replacing it after 8 weeks. Buy in bulk, the solution is not expensive but cheaper if you buy a lot at once.&lt;br /&gt;- The box and manual advertise this razor as wet and dry. I have not used it in the shower or near anything wet (yet) so your mileage may vary. I&#x27;ve had no issues using it for a dry shave, it&#x27;s very comfortable and leaves my skin without irritation.&lt;br /&gt;- The sideburn trimmer works very well but it&#x27;s just for that--sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendations...&lt;br /&gt;- I do recommend the cleaning station, it does a great job of cleaning, lubricating, and charging the razor automatically. Per the manual, the cleaning solution also lubricates the blade system so one less thing to do there.&lt;br /&gt;- You do not need to clean/charge it every day. However, I run mine through the cleaning station on average every day and skip a day here and there. The hygiene indicator will tell you when you should run it through a wash cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this has been a great razor so I recommend it if you get skin irritation (like me) pretty easily when shaving. I&#x27;ve had no irritation and get a very comfortable shave with relatively minimal effort.n it.&lt;br /&gt;- Be extra careful opening the cleaning solution if you plan on using it.

    <li> This is my husbands third Braun over the years. He loves it but of they break can&#x27;t find a place for repair</li>
    <li> Everything expected and more. Not inexpensive but worth the money. After all it is used everyday and for years! Best razor I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver, probably the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned, and I&#x27;ve owned several.  Very comfortable to hold, the adjustable shave settings actually make a difference, and the cleaning device works great.  Although a bit on the pricey side, I find this razor to be worth the money.  It gives a very close and comfortable shave, and does so fairly quickly.  I do recommend, as with any electric razor, a pre-shave (like Williams Lectric Shave) be used, as it makes the razor glide.  I can&#x27;t comment on how the razor works with a wet shave, as I prefer dry.</li>
    <li> Everything came as expected</li>
    <li> There are a ton of reviews here so I won&#x27;t re-hash the obvious.  Like most I considered the other two main contenders, the Panasonic and the Norelco.  I am sure both do a great of shaving.  What sold me is build quality.  The Braun feels like you are holding a sold piece of German Engineering.  The others feel plasticky and light.  I have a strong impression that this a shaver that I could pass on to my son.  I doubt the others will be around  The shave was amazingly close, not as close as a blade I feel, but the overall shave is better than a blade.  I recommend using it wet with Kiss My Face lotion.  If you are looking for an argument to sway your choice then consider build quality.</li>
    <li> My previous shaver was a Panasonic Arc 3.  Shaves better than the Panasonic when dry but falls behind a bit when shaving wet.  The cleaning unit is a lot quicker (and slightly quieter) than my previous Panasonic which is a plus.</li>
    <li> Received this as a christmas gift three years ago. It is my first electric razor, short of the cheap ones that never work. I do like eh convenience of it. I love the fact that I can shave in the shower of at the sink or wherever with it. While I think long term it is cheaper than buying blades (those things are expensive) there is still the cost of replacing the head (about every 6-12 months) and the cleaner cartridge (about every month). Using subscribe does help with those costs but they are still something to take into account. All in all I think it does a great job shaving if you use it on a regular basis. If you shave haphazardly then it may not be worth it for you. Also the more regular you shave the more your hair adapts to the razor and the better shave you get. Also it does tend to work better on dry skin than wet, at least for me.</li>
    <li> not as close as a blade even when I use it in the shower as a wet shave. even though I max rinse the cutting head, it still indicates it needs cleaning UPATE TO MY ORIGINAL REVIEW, early in 2017 my shaver no longer charged, indicated that it was, it just was not, talked to Braun about it BUT Braun insisted I return the entire shaver and charging/cleaning station, i decided against returning the whole thing</li>
    <li> This is a  great product, I am going to be straight to the point it is the best closest shave you can get from these types of shavers.  For about a month I used it and got that really close shave but I still had one part of my face where I couldn&#x27;t get all the hair off. Therefore I tried the wet shave method using my face wash as a before shave just around the beard area, trust me it worked. Being African American too, this product helped a lot with ingrown hair and guys exfoliate your beard area or your whole face.</li>
    <li> Well, did not turn out to be any more smoother shave than a razor, neither is it faster. It is just as hard on the skin and takes some time.</li>
    <li> Does very well, better than my previous Norelco electric razor, which I used for 3+ years. It does everything the description indicates and it does it VERY well.</li>
    <li> I have shaved with a Braun 7 series razor for the past 12+ years, and have generally found it to be a good product.  I have a light beard and don&#x27;t &#x27;stress&#x27; the razor at all.  The head locking system broke in the second year of operation, and the factory authorized (I don&#x27;t use refills, yet!) cleaning fluid discolors and eventually eats-away at the material used in the heads.  Great razor as far as a shave goes, but service is an unknown with this company.  Just try contacting Braun to find-out where the razor can be serviced, and you will get NOWHERE.  VERY frustrating!</li>
    <li> This is my third Braun electric shaver, I am sorry but the quality of shave is not as the old models. Overall it is alright.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT unless you realize it generates toxic fumes because the cleaning fluid is not sealed. And YOU CANNOT RETURN IT TO AMAZON due to the flammable and dangerous contents. Why would any one buy this?</li>
    <li> This is a pricey shaver but I LOVE IT! when charged, I leave it in my car and it will last nearly 2 weeks of every day shaving on a single charge. The cleaning/charging station works great and makes it like new every time it gets cleaned. The foil system is amazing. I have tried half a dozen or more shavers because razors hurt my skin and give me really bad razor bumps on my neck, no matter what shaving cream I use. This shaver, whether using wet or dry, is fantastic.</li>
    <li> Great Shave, does a great job of shaving... A little pricey but worth the shave!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric razors for over 40 years and this is by far the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had... Smooth-close-fast...</li>
    <li> Used Norelco all my life after using this product seems I wasted time,money as well as quality with those products. Easily the best I have used till date, money well spent</li>
    <li> Excellent shave and the cleaner is great too. On the expensive side when I purchased.</li>
    <li> Of all the razors I have tried in my life, manual and electric, this is the best one that I have had the opportunity to use. My beard is fairly heavy and grows in different directions on my neck, and in the past, this has accounted in missed hairs and cuts from the products I have used until I got to the point where I put off shaving as long as possible every week or two. I mostly used rotary electric razors and 3 blade manual razors and no matter what I tried, every time left me wanting for something more effective and less damaging to my skin surface. When I found the Braun Series 7 799CC and decided to invest in it to give it a chance to make my shaving experiences better, I could not have imagined a better result for the money. I no longer get nicks and cuts and missed hairs growing in different directions, and my skin feels as smooth as after a spa treatment every time I shave with no discomfort at all. I can appreciate that every person has a different hair growth and needs for a clean shave than mine are, but from my experience, I would be very comfortable recommending this product to anyone with moderate to heavy hair growth who needs a razor to take care of growth patterns and relieve the shaving experience to make it a positive thing rather than something to be dreaded or avoided. Also, the charging and clean-up couldn&#x27;t be easier - I took this razor on a 7 day cruise without the charging/cleaning unit and it performed excellently without need of a charge or specialized cleaning for that week period. I can recommend this razor without reservation and believe that for most users, your experience will be as good as mine.</li>
    <li> Simple put a great shaver.  What is more, you don&#x27;t have to pay $67.00 for new blades once a year like Norelco!  You simply buy blade every 18 months for half that price</li>
    <li> Best shaver ever. Very close shave and fast.  Love it for travel and to shave in the car.  Easy to use</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I have owned a number of electric shavers, Payer Lux, Phillishave, Remington and a previous Braun which has reached end of life after ten years.  I decided to treat myself with the new Braun. What a great product!  I am 100% happy with it.  Has an incredible smooth, high vibration rate that makes for the easiest and smoothest shave ever.  This Braun set is a complete system, charger with a wash and sterilization caddy.  Also does both a wet and dry shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it without reservation.  You will not find a better on the market.  I suggest you buy at least three spare blades and twelve shaver wash and sterilzation cartridges.  Also buy yourself an extra charger cord to take with you when you travel.  It plugs directly into the shaver for direct charging or shaving.  The caddy is too bulky to cart around.</li>
    <li> Hands down, this is the best shaver system Ive ever owned!  Upgraded from a Braun 8985 could not be happier.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best shaver I have ever purchased.  I have had a few shavers in my time, and this one by far takes the cake.  I have had it for a few weeks now, and it shaves clean and close, the first time.  I don&#x27;t have to keep going over and over the same area as I did with my Norelco, and it does not leave my neck raw or red.  When I am done shaving, I just place it in the cleaner/recharger and it cleans it out and charges it up in no time flat.  The other thing I really like about this shaver is that it comes with a hard case for traveling which protects it very well while in my bag, unlike my Norelco which came with a nylon bag and the head kept coming detached from the shaver while in my bag.  I recommend this shaver for anyone who likes a real clean and close along with smooth shave.</li>
    <li> This by far has been the BEST electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned. I&#x27;ve tried the three head rotating..... didn&#x27;t get it done for me. The razor and shaving cream worked great, but the expense of the throw away blades!!! I was hesitant to spend the money on the Braun but after about a week of using it about every other day my face adjusted to the new method of shaving and I felt the difference.&lt;br /&gt;I took it on vacation and the battery lasts (based on my use) a solid week before it started getting close to needing recharged. My cleaning fluid is just now getting low. I clean it about every other use and it has lasted almost 3 months. This is a must buy for any guy who likes a clean shave without all the monthly costs of the throw away razors.</li>
    <li> After my disastrous episode with the Norelco 9300 (see that review) I tried an old Braun that I had around the house and while it didn&#x27;t give a very close shave, it at least was user friendly and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. So I decided I&#x27;d try the top of the line Braun 7 799. It was a pleasant razor and while it didn&#x27;t shave much closer than my older Braun, it too didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, but was also not a superb close shave. After one week the razor cleaner said I had to replace the cleaning fluid, and as it was supposed to last about a month, rather than wait for a replacement cleaner, I decided to return the whole unit. Casting about for any possible replacement razor I discovered the Panasonic ES-LV61-A. If you&#x27;re interested, do read that review but basically, success at last!</li>
    <li> Gives a shave close to that of a blade. Works well on sensitive skin. Somewhat expensive but all the best rated ones were expensive. Cleaning cartridge difficult to open with spilling.</li>
    <li> Too bad I did not buy it earlier, great product now shaving is pleasurable and simple process it saves me time and hustle of cuts and all that bathroom tissue over them. It very hygienic no mess. I would definitely recommend it to guys with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is not like the Braun I had over 10 years ago! I shave in the shower and have tried various combinations. going back and forth between the norelco/panasonic wet/dry shavers. I ususally had to do a quick touch shave for under chin/nose/chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was ready for a change and was curious to give this a try. It is on the expensive side. the panasonic arc5&#x27;s are even more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting a &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; shave the first few days with new shaver. I like the different speeds and the first weekend I didnt need to do a touch shave on the more difficult areas. During the week I still may do a quick pass with my blade because my weekend shaven look vs my &amp;#34;work day shaven&amp;#34; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I m very happy I will save money on blades/cartidiges now.&lt;br /&gt;I ll add more improessions in the next few months&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you have the $ to get this go for it.&lt;br /&gt;I m going to use the 6 months interest free option to pay for this.</li>
    <li> It does advertise a 50 minute shave... battery life? I dont know...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost returned it. It took me what seemed like forever to shave the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t anywhere near as close of a shave as I expected. My razor, I guess, is the only thing that can do what I need it to do. But now I have an expensive bathroom decoration that makes noise and smells like rubbing alcohol....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I considered buying replacement razors. To see if maybe those would work better, but why would a brand new, never used (blah blah blah) razor need replacement blades after one shave? The &#x27;trimmer&#x27; portion couldn&#x27;t (or wouldn&#x27;t) cut my arm hair. (I may have gotten bored and tried to find a strength)</li>
    <li> This shaver is a marvelous piece of technology. The problem is it&#x27;s  very expensive and did not prevent razor burn or ingrown hairs or give the close shave as advertised. I could get the same shave for 1/6 the price. That is why I sent it back for a refund.</li>
    <li> not worth the price. You spend a lot of time to shave</li>
    <li> Best shaver on the market ! Look no further, the finest shave money can buy. Had a 5 series that worked well. However this shaver is on a whole new level of close .</li>
    <li> product as described, Would buy again.</li>
    <li> The very best you can get. Tried many through out the years never satisfied til I got this one. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Awesome shaver -- I can&#x27;t believe I never used an electric shaver till now</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for my previous Braun shaver, as has been my practice for many years.  I&#x27;ve simply bought the best Braun available and been very happy, until now. The problem is that this would be perceived as &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; based on price, which is apparently no longer true.  I have been using this razor for 4 months, have charged, cleaned, and done everything in between, and can now say IT SIMPLY IS INFERIOR TO PREVIOUS MODELS. Here&#x27;s why:  it has 3 power settings, with the dark blue labeled as the strongest, but that is a mislabeling, as the settings should be &amp;#34;weak,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;weaker,&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;weakest!&amp;#34;  Both of my older Brauns (which are almost worn out) shave my beard WAY closer than this thing!  Buyer beware, as sometimes you don&#x27;t get what you paid for, despite a steep cost!  I&#x27;m unfortunately in the market for a new electric razor.</li>
    <li> This razor which cost at least $250.00 tore up or irritated my face so much that after 3 weeks, I returned it and got a refund.  I have an old Norelco electric razor that cost maybe $50 that did a better job and was much smoother than the Braun.  I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Quickest, closest shave ever. Drop it in the base and it charges and cleans it all in one. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I was burning through Gillette Fusions roughly every 3 1/2 days, way too expensive (about $1.30 per day), much discomfort, skin mess.  Nothing wrong with the blade, just didn&#x27;t work with my face.  So I thought I would try the Braun.  60 day trial period made it easy.  My experience.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;  Takes a little longer to shave - 11 minutes (if I pay attention) vs 9.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;  Much less work, not having to be so careful, so I don&#x27;t mind the extra time.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;  Very few nicks or bumps; only occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;  Nearly as close as the Fusions&lt;br /&gt;&gt;  The wet/dry is good, I use Kiss My Face all natural shaving cream, works great, where I had problems with the atomic stuff from other vendors.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;  And I \\&quot;clean up\\&quot; with a Fusion at the end;  one Fusion blade has lasted 3 weeks in that usage.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;  With the clean up, literally as close as a blade&lt;br /&gt;&gt;  The \\&quot;lemon scent\\&quot; is very slight, quite fresh, not perfumy&lt;br /&gt;&gt;  Kind of noisy when it&#x27;s auto-cleaning, but it&#x27;s just the razor running in the plastic cleaning holder, like a buzz in a can&lt;br /&gt;&gt;  Haven&#x27;t reordered the cleaning fluids, but I expect to (still much less expensive than the Fusions)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy.  I reduced my shaving costs and have a much more comfortable, relaxing  that is plenty close.</li>
    <li> Close, comfortable electric shave.</li>
    <li> Love my 7 year old Braun electric shaver, didn&#x27;t give it up it went to weekend duty at the cabin, but totally glad I bought the new one.  It works so well no issues what so ever.</li>
    <li> Great shaver!  Wet shave with Aramis pre-shave solution gives better and more comfortable shave than non-wet shave.  Quieter shaver than my braun 790.</li>
    <li> Works very well and my husband is very satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;The battery last forever!!&lt;br /&gt;And the system to clean does miracle; the razor is like a new one after cleaning at the station.</li>
    <li> Gave his wife, and she loved it.</li>
    <li> Workds great, really quieter than the old model .  The only complaint my husband had was it didn&#x27;t have a flat edged pop up clipper that he used to, it has one, but curved and it is fine, but he wanted the flat edged so we just bought a Wahl clipper to go with this. Otherwise this is a great machine.</li>
    <li> Great shave, comfortable and with the personal comfort settings no razor burn. Razor feels good in your hand, well made and has all the bells and whistles anyone could want. Pricey, but worth it to me.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed... Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been using a Norelco shaver for some time with fair results. I read the reviews and decided to buy a Braun Series 7 799-6WD. The unit worked fine the first time and every time after. I gave me a very close shave - about a good as a safety razor and cleans out easily in the accompanying unit. In short, it does the job and I am very please with it. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone needed a new razor. It is a little pricey but as far as I&#x27;m concerned, worth the few dollars more.</li>
