      <li>I also love,love love sweet smells!</li>
      <li>It has a very pleasant smell, and lasted me a long time.</li>
      <li>and when I leave work around two PM I am still able to enjoy the enhancing aroma.  </li>
      <li>and I thoroughly love and enjoy VELVET SUGAR.  </li>
      <li>But this one goes on strong but very quickly subdues into a nice, mild</li>
      <li>Pleasant mild scent was not too sweet of a scent just right</li>
      <li>it out -- now is the time to start thinking about gifts for the women in your life and this is the perfect gift for everyone of them, young and mature!  </li>
      <li>You would probably enjoy having some for yourself also.  </li>
      <li>This is the best smell ever I use berry flirt before but now that it&#x27;s not available</li>
      <li>Light, fruity, and musky.</li>
      <li>I ordered this for my little girl,-yes,they love to smell good too!</li>
      <li>My son ordered this for me, Love the scent, The shipping was very fast so,  I will purchase once again for their Prompt Services.....</li>
      <li>I LOVE this scent so much!</li>
      <li>Very similar to Frosted Wonderland and Warm Vanilla Sugar ,but  no complaints here,as me and my girls love vanilla and sugary scents.&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
      <li>I enjoyed the reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>Is so sweet</li>
      <li>Its a bit fruity,  but not too sweet to where it would give you a headache.  </li>
      <li>Also I have to mention awesome communication skills from sellers part,had a little delay and seller was prompt and ready to look out for my order and</li>
      <li>Wow, I love this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Golden Amber, Vanilla , Tolu Balsam, Caramel, Baileyâ€TMs CrÃ¨me, Sugared Musk</li>
      <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell like cookies like a  lot of their scents do, more like cotton candy but not really overpoweringly strong.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely one of my favorite scents from Bath &amp; Body Works right now.</li>
      <li>I wear the lotion with this same scent and love it.  </li>
      <li>I get many compliments during the day and constantly get asked WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?!!!  </li>
      <li>it smells very sweet... a bit different than the one i had bought at bath and body works</li>
      <li>This goes really well if you have the matching lotion too ;)</li>
      <li>mist smells like a bouquet of many different scents -- I can detect a definite cotton candy odor, some light musk, and a gentle fruity sweetness.  </li>
      <li>They smell good, scent just doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
      <li>I really  like the fragrance for this body mist.  </li>
      <li>This product also ships fast.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much for this product.</li>
      <li>One of the top notes for this fragrance that is dominant is wild strawberry, which you can definitely smell.</li>
      <li>You can definitely smell the sugar but it is not overly sweet.  </li>
      <li>My new fave!</li>
      <li>The overall combination of these scents results in a fresh, semi-sweet, lingering, non-overbearing perfume that you can wear for any occasion.  </li>
      <li>I wish it wasn&#x27;t packaged as if it is exclusively for young girls.</li>
      <li>I spray some on early in the morning</li>
      <li>Pink Jasmine, Golden Plum, Red Velvet Créme, Dewy Honeysuckle,</li>
      <li>Wild Strawberries, White Nectarine, Pear Blossom, Apple Nectar</li>

    <li> They smell good, scent just doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> smells so good and sweet and I get a lot of compliments on it</li>
    <li> I spritz this stuff on to me everyday and whenever I walk past people they always ask what I&#x27;m wearing :) This goes really well if you have the matching lotion too ;)</li>
    <li> Strong...with hints of warm vanilla. I didn&#x27;t personally care for this.</li>
    <li> My perfume top was not on its leaking</li>
    <li> Smells great! Especially nice when paired with the coordinating lotion!</li>
    <li> This is just as wonderful as the wash!!! Mmmm!!! I just love it!!! A spritz here or there and you smell like sweets all day. Mmm</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon but I did receive it for Christmas and I love it! I use it every time I go somewhere. It&#x27;s definitely one of my favorite scents from Bath &amp; Body Works right now. I just ordered the shower gel in this scent and I can&#x27;t wait to get that in the mail soon!</li>
    <li> granddaughters favorite</li>
    <li> The scent is amazingly sweet.i wore it today and i received compliments from everyone.i would totally recommend it to anyone..</li>
    <li> I really love this spray it smells very good, when I wear it all my friends think it&#x27;s an expensive colone. I love this spray...</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this body spray, my co- worker sprayed some on at work and I fell in love with the smell so I asked what was it and she told me &amp;#34; Velvet Sugar&amp;#34; and I love it...</li>
    <li> I LOVE this scent so much! I wish it wasn&#x27;t packaged as if it is exclusively for young girls. It helps extend the smell of the ;otion with the same scent, but it still does not last as long as I would like. I might keep a small spray bottle of it in my desk so I can refresh at work.</li>
    <li> I received my order today of the Bath and Body Works Velvet Sugar body mist and although I absolutely love the scent, upon opening the package I noticed the bottle had leaked pretty bad. It leaked all the way through the packaging, everything was soaked inside and out.</li>
    <li> nice! my wife likes it.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume I put it on every day and it is jus so good smelling I love it</li>
    <li> I love,love love body sprays! I also love,love love sweet smells! I am enjoying my Bath and Body work Velvet sugar spray. I also have the lotion as well and it smells just as good. I spray and go and since the scent goes away a few hours later,I throw this in my purse along with the velvet sugar lotion! I love them both. Regularly, I am a Victoria Secret girl,but this velvet sugar have me wanting to try more B&amp;B works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Velvet sugar also smells like the VS Total attraction. I don&#x27;t mind by having to spray it mutiple times a day,that gives me a excuse to spray it! I usually spray my VS one time and that is all it takes.</li>
    <li> My favorite smelling perfume mist! Yummy</li>
    <li> Love this scent...Very clean smells.&lt;br /&gt;I got the Shower gel, Bubble bath,  Body Cream, Body Lotion, Diamond Shimmer Mist,&lt;br /&gt;Fragance mist!  LOVE IT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Suit perfect on my skin,  very nice smells!!!</li>
    <li> My son ordered this for me, Love the scent, The shipping was very fast so,  I will purchase once again for their Prompt Services..... Thank You ......!</li>
    <li> I really  like the fragrance for this body mist.  You can definitely smell the sugar but it is not overly sweet.  This body mist smells good and lasts throughout the day.</li>
    <li> But this one goes on strong but very quickly subdues into a nice, mild scent.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell like cookies like a  lot of their scents do, more like cotton candy but not really overpoweringly strong.</li>
    <li> Light, fruity, and musky. It has a very pleasant smell, and lasted me a long time. I got a lot of compliments on the scent. This product also ships fast.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS SPRAY DEFINITELY ONE OF MY TOP FAVS!!!!!!</li>
    <li> came on time and smells absolutely amazing</li>
    <li> it smells very sweet... a bit different than the one i had bought at bath and body works but it still smells good.</li>
    <li> I loooove the scent, but it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
    <li> Smells great! My new fave!</li>
    <li> use for myself and boyfriend loves the smell. the other was a gift and she loves it as well</li>
    <li> I wear the lotion with this same scent and love it.  With the spray, however, the scent does not last at all, not even for an hour.  I would recommend sticking with the lotions.</li>
    <li> My daughter requested this scent for Christmas!  She loves the fragrance and light scent!  I enjoyed the reasonable price.  Excellent!</li>
    <li> Is so sweet but it&#x27;s so good!!</li>
    <li> I have given this fragrance to my crumb. I am very happy as it smells</li>
    <li> Fav scent at B &amp; BW these past 2 years, hope it stays!</li>
    <li> BATH BODY WORKS VELVET SUGAR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this nicely packaged and eye-appealing eight ounce mist fragrance as a gift from a friend.  Wow, I love this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fragrance is not over-whelming or too sweetish smelling.  It is subtle and long-lasting.  I spray some on early in the morning and when I leave work around two PM I am still able to enjoy the enhancing aroma.  I get many compliments during the day and constantly get asked WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?!!!  It just smells that great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mist smells like a bouquet of many different scents -- I can detect a definite cotton candy odor, some light musk, and a gentle fruity sweetness.  The overall combination of these scents results in a fresh, semi-sweet, lingering, non-overbearing perfume that you can wear for any occasion.  And, this is not just for the younger set!  I am a senior grandma lady and I thoroughly love and enjoy VELVET SUGAR.  The name is just so perfect for this different and wonderful mist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check it out -- now is the time to start thinking about gifts for the women in your life and this is the perfect gift for everyone of them, young and mature!  You would probably enjoy having some for yourself also.  The price is right and the smell is sublime, delicate, refined, and sultry all rolled into one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I went out on a limb to see if I would like this scent and I absolutely loved it! Thanks so much for this product. Will be getting more!</li>
    <li> This smells so good. I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s $50 on hear. It&#x27;s only $14 at bath and body works. But it&#x27;s my favorite. :)</li>
    <li> Came in less than a week. All wrapped up in bubble wrap so it was very secure. This perfume is amazing and I recommend it to any girl who likes to smell fruity and flirty. Will be ordering again!! :)</li>
    <li> Pleasant mild scent was not too sweet of a scent just right</li>
    <li> This mist smells absolutely delicious! It comes with a lot of product,  8 fl. Oz., and its a pretty good price. One of the top notes for this fragrance that is dominant is wild strawberry, which you can definitely smell. Its a bit fruity,  but not too sweet to where it would give you a headache.  Very nice packaging as well. The liquid is pink, and the bottle is clear,  so when you&#x27;re using it, you can tell. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> Top Notes: Wild Strawberries, White Nectarine, Pear Blossom, Apple Nectar&lt;br /&gt;Mid Notes: Pink Jasmine, Golden Plum, Red Velvet Créme, Dewy Honeysuckle, Freesia&lt;br /&gt;Dry Notes: Golden Amber, Vanilla , Tolu Balsam, Caramel, Baileyâ€TMs CrÃ¨me, Sugared Musk&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this smell it&#x27;s great for all ages, defenately a keeper, and highly reccomended.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my little girl,-yes,they love to smell good too!:) I ended up sharing it with her,because its just so comforting.Very similar to Frosted Wonderland and Warm Vanilla Sugar ,but  no complaints here,as me and my girls love vanilla and sugary scents.&lt;br /&gt;Came nicely packaged.Also I have to mention awesome communication skills from sellers part,had a little delay and seller was prompt and ready to look out for my order and help.&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and order this body mist,especially if you have daughters like me. Its a great buy,will order again.</li>
