      <li>haven&#x27;t experienced any kind of sensitivity with Crest Whitestrips, and for me, they work very well, but you need to use ALL OF THEM, not just one or two, to get the full effect.  </li>
      <li>This newer version works even better the original, and fits more appropriately.</li>
      <li>Most importantly, I asked my dentist if whitening strips were safe for my teeth</li>

      <li>Easy to apply and remove.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t work that great for me because I have more dental issues and it only work on service stains and did not remove enamel stains.</li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t know if you can get to Bidenwhite by using them consistently.&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion this is sensible easy to use product that can fit your lifestyle and maybe your budget.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used previous versions of Crest Whitestrips and have always been impressed.  </li>
      <li>Everything was fine</li>
      <li>and while I could always live with the idea of wearing the plastic film on my teeth for eight hours or more, the idea of getting it done in two hours certainly had great appeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would never think of napping while wearing the original Crest Whitestrips that did not have the \\&quot;Advanced Seal\\&quot; because those slid off the teeth too easily</li>

      <li>I have tried the 3d whitestrips that were the standard kind and the kind with the advanced seal.</li>
      <li>I also doubt that you can, or would want to, eat while wearing the \\&quot;Advanced Seal\\&quot; strips.  </li>
      <li>I purchased these one specifically because I heard they were good for people with sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>Super easy to use.  </li>
      <li>but these brought my teeth to whiter shade(s) within days--rather over a week for the original crest whitestrips.</li>
      <li>The original Whitestrips had 6% hydrogen peroxide.  </li>

      <li>the original Whitestrips did.  </li>
      <li>I think the advanced seal ones are easier to apply because the strip is stiffer and thicker than the old kind.  </li>

      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for an affordable and easy way to brighten your smile, give Crest a try.</li>
      <li>When you have a special occasion  to attend, try them.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s best to do it at night at least 8 hours before drinking coffee or wine that will stain your teeth afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

      <li>Overall, these strips work as you would expect and do a good job of whitening.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After the full 10 days of use</li>
      <li>All in all not a bad product.</li>
      <li>the standard version and the advanced seal kind whitened my teeth</li>
      <li>But, for what you pay for the strips and what you&#x27;d pay at your dentist&#x27;s is such a drastic difference that these are more than worthwhile</li>
      <li>That product whitens better and brighter and lasts longer than either this \\&quot;High</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are great! They worked wonders!</li>
    <li> I only had to use this for 3 days in a row about a week before my wedding. By the third day my teeth were noticeably whiter. I purchased these one specifically because I heard they were good for people with sensitive teeth. I have never bleached my teeth before, and I was all paranoid about it hurting after the first bleach. Everything was fine and I would use these again.</li>
    <li> These whitestrips do an excellent job. They stay on your teeth very well compared to other strips which slide around a lot. Whiten noticeably. They leave your teeth very sensitive however so you absolutely have to get a toothpaste like sensodyne to counteract that.</li>
    <li> A total bargain.  I bought these for my son and his teeth are so much whiter.  I will definitely by these again and for myself.  :)</li>
    <li> Great product!! Did it with my wife. She did have a little sensitivity after the treatments, but was pleased with the results!</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant about how well these could possibly work - was very pleased and definitely noticed a significant difference after just a couple of applications. Super easy to use.  I will continue to purchase these to maintain the whitening that has happened</li>
    <li> Great product, it does work and you can see the difference in about four days. You do get some sensitivity but it will go away and if you read the directions and it is stated.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-They stay on your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;-Treatments are only 30min&lt;br /&gt;-Noticed results in 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;-Definitely whiter after 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Cause slight tooth sensitivity after treatment, nothing too bad or out of the ordinary though. I would just do a treatment before bed.&lt;br /&gt;-Sometimes a little difficult to remove from your teeth. Just grab a corner and pull slowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its good!</li>
    <li> I bought these white strips on a whim, my teeth were very yellow. Within three days I noticed a big difference and after ten its honestly life changing.....my teeth are actually white and I&#x27;ve gotten comments on how nice they look. Also yes they will make your teeth very sensitive, suck it up and get white teeth.</li>
    <li> Yes, these did whiten my teeth.  They do stick onto your teeth a little better than the other Whitestrips.  However, I don&#x27;t think these were any better than the cheaper version.  I won&#x27;t buy these again because they cost more and don&#x27;t necessarily do more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used previous versions of Crest Whitestrips and have always been impressed.  Following the instructions, I use them on \\&quot;dirty teeth\\&quot;.  My dentist has told me that if I have any sensitivity from the whitestrips, to use them every other day instead of every day.  For these, after just three days my teeth were much whiter.  You have to wear them a little longer than the other varieties but you get great results.  I haven&#x27;t had any sensitivity from these and I am able to drink without any problems.  I had to laugh at myself as I drank my coffee while getting rid of the coffee stains.  One thing I will point out, if your teeth are very wet when you apply the strips, they won&#x27;t stick as well.  Also, take them off slowly so they don&#x27;t remove any loose dental work you might have.  When stuck to your teeth, they REALLY stick.</li>
    <li> It looks as if the box had been opened before and is missing 2 out of the 10 strips. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I use these and only these.  They work better than the zoom white, which I have done in the past.  I even get comments from homeless people at my gleaming white teeth!!  (seriously)  And comments from friends too!</li>
    <li> இ Fuzzy Wuzzy&#x27;s Summary:&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾѾ Recommended with warm fuzzies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a daily drinker of strong dark coffees and strong dark teas, I have been using the Crest Whitestrips ever since they first became available.  I thought that they would help with maintaining the whiteness in between periodic visits to the dentist for teeth check-ups and cleaning.  The original Crest Whitestrips easily moved around or even slid completely off my teeth, sometimes within minutes after I put them on my teeth.  The original Whitestrips had 6% hydrogen peroxide.  Compared to the whitening that dentists perform, these Whitestrips do not whiten as much (due to the dentist office&#x27;s much higher hydrogen peroxide concentration of 35%) or as quickly (since dentists use lights and lasers to accelerate the whitening process while you sit in their office).  But either with or without dentist whitenings, these Whitestrips are a far more economical way of whitening your teeth at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original Whitestrips are now re-branded and marketed as [[ASIN:B00336EUU4 Crest 3d White Gentle Routine Teeth Whitening Strips 28 Count]]. Crest used to call this product \\&quot;Whitestrips Classic\\&quot; because it was the original Whitestrips version.  If you have sensitive teeth, this product is based on the original Whitestrips with a weaker 6% hydrogen peroxide concentration, it does not have the \\&quot;Advanced Seal\\&quot; duct tape stickiness of the other Whitestrips versions, and since it instructs the user to keep it on the teeth for just 5 minutes, there is minimal irritation to sensitive teeth and gums.  However, this \\&quot;Gentle Routine\\&quot; also has less whitening power and it can slide off your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the original Crest Whitestrips and the \\&quot;Gentle Routine\\&quot; Whitestrips, the \\&quot;Advanced Seal\\&quot; technology really does work to hold the strips firmly to the teeth.  On my teeth, the lower strip sometimes does not stick as well as the upper strip, which always sticks as firmly as duct tape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions recommend that you do not brush your teeth before application.  But I usually brush my teeth anyway if I apply the strips after eating a meal.  Once I used my fingers to firmly press the strips onto my upper and lower teeth, the strips never moved around the way the original Whitestrips did.  Even though some Whitestrips advertisements say that you can talk and drink water while wearing the strips, I always avoid drinking water or other fluids while wearing the strips out of concern that the fluid will dilute the peroxide whitening agent; I want to maximize the peroxide&#x27;s concentration on my teeth and get the most whitening effect with each treatment.  I also doubt that you can, or would want to, eat while wearing the \\&quot;Advanced Seal\\&quot; strips.  Although it is far easier to talk while wearing the \\&quot;Advanced Seal\\&quot; strips compared with the original Whitestrips (which could easily be moved or dislodged with the slightest mouth movements), with the \\&quot;Advanced Seal\\&quot; strips stuck to my teeth, my speech was usually slightly altered, as if I had a bit of peanut butter in my mouth or as if I was wearing braces.  But other than not drinking/eating and minimizing my talking, I could go about my daily routines while wearing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should not use these whitening strips on loose teeth because when you press the \\&quot;Advanced Seal\\&quot; onto your teeth and let them sit there, peeling them off after 30 minutes of use can feel like peeling off duct tape that is firmly stuck to your teeth.  When you peel the strips off, there is a slightly odd aftertaste, but it was not disagreeable to me and can be easily washed away by rinsing with water.  I do not think that you have to wear these strips for EXACTLY 30 minutes; 30 minutes is just the minimum amount of time that you should wear them.  I have sometimes even taken an afternoon nap of 40 to 60 minutes with the strips left on my teeth, and when I wake up, both the upper and lower strips have not moved.  I would never think of napping while wearing the original Crest Whitestrips that did not have the \\&quot;Advanced Seal\\&quot; because those slid off the teeth too easily and so I would need to be awake to focus on not moving my mouth while I wore those Whitestrips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is my verdict after using this 10-day supply of \\&quot;Crest 3D White High Performance Whitening Whitestrips\\&quot;?  My teeth are noticeably whiter.  The improved whitening started to become apparent after using the third set of strips, and was definitely noticeable after using the fifth set of strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not to say that nothing happens after using the first two pairs of strips, but just that after each treatment, there is a gradual progression of whitening.  After the very first treatment, I noticed just a very slight bit of whitening, I noticed it more after the second and third treatments, and by the fourth and fifth treatments, my teeth were definitely whiter.  From having used many of these Whitestrips before, I also realized that the reverse was also true - once I have reached a specific level of whiteness, if I stopped using the Whitestrips, even if I continued to brush my teeth regularly using so-called \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; toothpastes, my teeth would slowly lose that level of whiteness, especially since I drink coffee or strong tea on a daily basis.  I think that whitening toothpastes help prolong the duration of whitening, but they are not as effective as these hydrogen peroxide whitening treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foods and drinks that are notorious for staining teeth include coffee, tea, all wines, acidic drinks like colas and energy/sports drinks, sauces such as soy/tomato/curry sauce, berries, and candies and sweets that have been artificially colored.  Basically, if the food or drink can stain your tongue while you eat it or can stain your clothing or carpet if you spill it, it can also stain your teeth.  Foods and drinks that are acidic (colas, candies, fruits) or contain tannins (wines, tea) enhance the ability of colors to stick to the tooth enamel.  Along with using hydrogen peroxide whitening strips and whitening toothpaste, to help prolong the whiteness of your teeth after using Whitestrips treatments, you can drink fluids through a straw to keep the staining beverage away from your teeth.  Using a straw works well for colas and energy/sports drinks, but it may look odd drinking wine through a straw, and I do not want to stick a plastic straw into a very hot cup of coffee or tea.  It also helps to swallow foods and drinks promptly to reduce the amount of time that the staining ingredients are in contact with the teeth.  But when it comes to drinks, even if you swallow promptly, but it still takes you 40 sips from a can of cola before you finish that drink, you are still bathing your teeth in the staining cola unless you take each sip through a straw and swallow promptly.  Finally, promptly rinse your mouth with water or chew sugarless gum after eating or drinking to clear your mouth of staining agents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest also markets [[ASIN:B001OOLLVS Crest 3D White Advanced Vivid Whitening Strips, 14 Pouches Containing Upper/Lower Strips (28 Total Strips)]] ...

That is the only difference between these two differently-named products.  The \\&quot;Advanced Vivid\\&quot; version came on the market in 2009, and this renamed \\&quot;High-Performance\\&quot; re-branding came on the market in 2012.  I do not know why Crest chose to repackage and re-brand the \\&quot;Advanced Vivid\\&quot; Whitestrips and call these \\&quot;High Performance\\&quot; since they are basically just a 10-count version of the \\&quot;Advanced Vivid Whitestrips 14 Count\\&quot; product, but depending upon the Amazon pricing between this \\&quot;High Performance\\&quot; and the \\&quot;Advanced Vivid\\&quot; versions, go for the package that costs less per unit count.  For example, at the time of this review&#x27;s writing, this \\&quot;High Performance\\&quot; 10-treatment box costs $32.21 or $3.22 per treatment, and the \\&quot;Advanced Vivid\\&quot; box is quite a bit more inexpensive, costing $31.24 for a 14-treatment box or $2.23 per treatment.  Since the Whitestrips in both of these two products are identical, you can currently purchase the less expensive \\&quot;Advanced Vivid\\&quot; box and get four more treatments for a cheaper price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need to whiten your teeth at a quicker pace, the \\&quot;Crest 3D White Intensive Professional Effects Teeth Whitening Strips\\&quot; is a better, but more expensive, choice than this \\&quot;High Performance\\&quot; or the \\&quot;Advanced Vivid\\&quot; versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And totally bypass the \\&quot;Crest 3D White 2-Hour Express Whitestrips Dental Whitening Kit\\&quot; product for two reasons: (1) it is inconvenient to wear these 2-hour strips unless you always wear them while napping or sleeping, and, most importantly, (2) its promise that you can wear these strips for 2 hours every three months, just using 4 treatments in one year, is insufficient frequency of treatment to make much of a difference during the entire 3-month spans in between treatments.  The \\&quot;Crest 3D White Intensive Professional Effects Teeth Whitening Strips\\&quot; is a better option than this \\&quot;Express\\&quot; version, but both of these Whitestrips versions also have the highest per-treatment cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite version of Crest Whitestrips is the [[ASIN:B00336EUTK Crest 3d White Professional Effects Teeth Whitening Strips 20 Count]].  That product whitens better and brighter and lasts longer than either this \\&quot;High Performance\\&quot; Whitestrips or the \\&quot;Advanced Vivid\\&quot; version, and with its current $2.00 per treatment cost, it also has one of the best per-treatment costs among all the Whitestrips versions.  So I rate this \\&quot;High Performance\\&quot; Whitestrips 4 stars, whereas I rate the non-intensive/non-express version of the \\&quot;Professional Effects\\&quot; Whitestrips 5 stars.e the ability of colors to stick to the tooth enamel.

    <li> I decided to give these a try after my teeth became a bit dingy. Due to sensitivity I found I could only do one treatment every couple days, but at the end of it, my husband (who didn&#x27;t know I was using these strips) said, &amp;#34;Hey, your teeth look whiter all of a sudden!&amp;#34; And I would agree, while they aren&#x27;t movie star white, they are definitely brighter and I am happy with the results.</li>
    <li> The Crest 3d White High Performance Whitening Whitestrips are pricey, but they do the job! When you have a special occasion  to attend, try them. I love they way they brighten my smile, and this version is less harsh on my gums and even more efficient than the last time I tried them.&lt;br /&gt;I always use them before I attend a wedding and the different it makes it really noticable. I am 61 now, and I like my smile. Therefore I am proud to show it off when I have used these strips. I am a faithful Crest Whitestrips user and NOTHING has ever come close to the wonderful way they work.&lt;br /&gt;This time, with this new version, my teeth started looking phemonenally better after just two days!&lt;br /&gt;This product is awesome. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> In the past, I have had my teeth whitened with molds made by my dentist.  To be honest, I like these strips better.  They don&#x27;t completely cover all my teeth, but they cover the teeth that anyone would see when I smile.  I had a hard time squirting the gel into the molds made for my teeth, so like that there&#x27;s nothing to spread on the strips.  They&#x27;re much easier to use that way, just pull them off the plastic and push onto your teeth.  Leave them on for 10 minutes, or up to 2 hours.  They didn&#x27;t hurt my gums,or slide around so I left them on for 2 hours.  My teeth look great and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend reading the instructions to decide what&#x27;s best for your own personal use.</li>
    <li> Crest Whitestrips come in a variety of products, this one is called 3D White - High Performance Whitening. I have tried some of their other variety and this one is more effective than their 2-hour product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package contains 10 pairs for one course. There are no left-over strips or surrounding material for reuse. You get exactly 10 treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that my teeth are whiter by at least one shade, but not more than two shades. Look up on Google for teeth whiteness shades. It is not easy to remember the whiteness of your teeth before starting the course and compare it to the final results. I tried to take pictures, but no use. I don&#x27;t have necessary equipment and setup for this kind of photography.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You should not brush right before the treatment&lt;br /&gt;- Apply bottom strip first - this is important&lt;br /&gt;- Make sure that you wait 30 minutes before removing the strips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I agree that this product works, I think they are priced very high.</li>
    <li> I have fairly sensitive teeth so I was a little worried about using these. In the past, I haven&#x27;t been able to go the full length of treatment with Crest Whitestrips and even as long as I&#x27;d used them, I saw no difference at all. Wow, what a difference with these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These aren&#x27;t the glue-like strips that make you feel like your teeth are being ripped out when you take them off. They&#x27;re the simple strips, on and off in a half hour and they weren&#x27;t uncomfortable while I was wearing them. After three days, I saw a difference. Three days. When I got done, they were definitely whiter and since I&#x27;m already using the Crest Whitening Toothpaste and Mouthwash, I&#x27;ll just keep it up and post dental visits, whenever I think I need a little brightening, I&#x27;ll definitely go this route again. I still have no sensitivity issues two weeks after my last treatment.</li>
    <li> I love the Crest 3D White High Performance Whitening Whitestrips! I noticed a difference after two days! As a coffee drinker, I worry about stains and darkening, but this certainly worked well and I would definitely buy again!  Easy to use and there was no pain or tingling of my teeth as many other products produce when you use a whitening product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used various teeth whitening products over the years, though not frequently. Along the Crest products, I used the Vivid strips.  On cursory glance I didn&#x27;t think these were any different from those, though having used them, they definitely are.  First off, they are slightly thicker, and they didn&#x27;t slip AT ALL.  The Vivid strips moved all over the place, such that I quit using them without even finishing the box.  These stuck, so well I had to pry them from my teeth with my fingernails and nicked my gum in the process. That didn&#x27;t feel so great, but I attribute it to user error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, these work well.  Because they didn&#x27;t slip the frothing of the mouth was minimal.  They burned my gums during and for about half an hour after.  An area of my gums turned white, also. My teeth felt fairly sensitive after use, though diminished over about 12 hours.  My teeth are sensitive enough that I can&#x27;t use them daily without pain, but they whiten well enough even over that duration that they are worth it. I don&#x27;t need to use any whitening product much to lighten them to a naturally pearly shade, so I&#x27;m pleased with that.  I don&#x27;t see me ever paying for an intense professional whitening treatment, which makes these more affordable.</li>
    <li> it was simple enough to use. it was a slight discomfort the first time you put it on, but it goes away after a while. It felt a little funny every time I talked though.</li>
    <li> I have tried the 3d whitestrips that were the standard kind and the kind with the advanced seal. I think the advanced seal ones are easier to apply because the strip is stiffer and thicker than the old kind.  They stay in place better even if I need to talk, but are more difficult to remove.  It&#x27;s like pulling a sticker off of your teeth.  They come off, but you need to use your fingernails to get the process going. Be careful not to scratch your gums. The bottom strip is smaller in the advanced seal set compared to the standard version and wraps around the front of the teeth a little less while wrapping around the back of the teeth a good bit less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the standard version and the advanced seal kind whitened my teeth well and I got sensitivity with both.  I can only use them for 15 minutes rather than 30 or I end up with very painful teeth.  I was about to toss them after a few 30 minute sessions, so I&#x27;m glad I decided to try using them for only 15 minutes instead.</li>
    <li> I love Crest Whitestrips.  I always come back to them.  I&#x27;ve tried different brands, the pens, the ampules etc.  None of them work as effectively or leave results as lasting as Crest Whitestrips.  These are easy to use, these cover all the visible teeth of even the biggest/widest smiles.  They don&#x27;t cause sensitivity and it&#x27;s easy to talk while wearing them.  I have used the&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00336EUTK Crest 3d White Professional Effects Teeth Whitening Strips 20 Count]] as well and while the results are even more dramatic, the sensitivity is a big issues.  For my money, these are the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d used \\&quot;regular\\&quot; Crest Whitestrips in the past back when they took 8 hours, and then when they needed only 2 hours, and now they&#x27;re down to getting the job done in 30 minutes.  and while I could always live with the idea of wearing the plastic film on my teeth for eight hours or more, the idea of getting it done in two hours certainly had great appeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with previous versions of the product, application of the film on the teeth is very simple, and once they&#x27;re on, its easy to forget that you&#x27;re wearing them, and you could - if you wanted to - go out in public wearing them with no one noticing them, unless they&#x27;re closely looking at your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t experienced any kind of sensitivity with Crest Whitestrips, and for me, they work very well, but you need to use ALL OF THEM, not just one or two, to get the full effect.  It&#x27;s not a permanent solution, but the effects do last for months - I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work that great for me because I have more dental issues and it only work on service stains and did not remove enamel stains. I&#x27;d have to get lumineers or a snap on smile. Overall it did try to work but it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I have tried several different at-home teeth whitening products, including the old Crest Whitening Strips.  Crest&#x27;s old whitening strips were made out of a material that was flimsy and they didn&#x27;t stay on your teeth.  These strips are a tremendous improvement over the old whitening strips.  The stick on your teeth throughout the entire whitening process.  I used the entire box in two weeks and definitely noticed a difference.  However, the high cost makes them a once-in-awhile treat instead of a beauty staple.</li>
    <li> These strips work as well as their predecessors. In fact, not a whole lot better, but no worse. They do stick a little better but can sometimes wrinkle and fold, you have to take care when placing them. And be sure to keep them off the gums, the peroxide solution can be irritating to some. All in all not a bad product. Just need good dexterity and patience.</li>
    <li> I love Crest Whitestrips, they give me a brillant smile that always garners compliments. This newer version works even better the original, and fits more appropriately. My teeth are sensitive afterwards, but that is not atypical with this type of product. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Perfect option to perk up your mouth half-way through the year.  Crest is the most popular whitening strip for a reason.  They&#x27;ve vastly improved the product since it first came out.  The strips can be applied to top or bottom now, but top is recommended.  you simply fold the strip at the crest of your teeth and wait 30 minutes without eating or drinking.  Stay at home if you do your bottom teeth - and just try it if you want to find out why.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an affordable and easy way to brighten your smile, give Crest a try. I buy Crest toothpaste whenever possible, and I do the same for white strips. These are great if you need to whiten your teeth before an upcoming event or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Beats the price a dentist would charge, by far.&lt;br /&gt;- Get noticeable results (although you won&#x27;t blind anyone).&lt;br /&gt;- They do not appear harmful to sensitive teeth, which I consider myself to have.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to apply and remove.&lt;br /&gt;- See results after just a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Slightly awkward wearing the strips, but it&#x27;s expected.</li>
    <li> I used just one of the 10 strips and I already saw a difference. Cant wait to see the complete results.</li>
    <li> These whitening strips are great! I haven&#x27;t finished all ten strips yet, but have seen a huge improvement in the whiteness of my teeth! My teeth have only become a little bit sensitive and only once in a while do my gums hurt, but ONLY while using them. I&#x27;ve become a bit busy and set aside my last four strips to use later, and my teeth/gums have returned to normal and haven&#x27;t been sensitive at all. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Crest has so many different kinds of white strips, it is honestly hard for me to keep them straight. I like them, and I like to use them every 6 months or so to keep my teeth white. A problem I run into is teeth sensitivity, after one or two uses my teeth get very sensitive and I have to stop for a few days. I am still looking to find a product that doesn&#x27;t have this problem. This one is not it. But it will whiten.</li>
    <li> They weren&#x27;t kidding about the Advanced Seal Technology, these things stick tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also work well too, you&#x27;ll definitely notice the difference after a few days use.  Crest makes versions you keep on your teeth for longer, but these strips are NOT invisible, so if you have a busy schedule like me, you&#x27;ll want this 30 min version, not the ones you wear for longer, as you won&#x27;t be able to hold easy conversations or go out in public wearing these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also a plus with this 30 min version, it makes my teeth much less sensitive than the longer applications I&#x27;ve tried.  Overall, if you&#x27;re busy and want whiter teeth, this is the product to buy.</li>
    <li> The last time I had used Crest White Strips was 2004 and you had to use them for half an hour Twice a day for 30 days! And they didn&#x27;t always last 30 minutes before whimping out and they made you almost slobber like your dog. Well they have definitely been improved. Now it&#x27;s just one time a day for ten days, the strips are extremely sticky( so just make sure you place them where you actually want them the first time) and they cured the salivating problem so your mouth stays comfortable. My only issue was that the strips were so sticky that they were almost hard to remove from your teeth, the lower ones in particular. But I saw results the first day and my teeth are at least 3-4 shades whiter.</li>
    <li> this is by far the best whitening stripes in the market comparing to the other whitening strips ,the only bad thing about this one is the lower strip is small , but it worth buying .</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy this product for a while now, but I was skeptical about the price &amp; quantity of strips. After one use I saw no difference and was a little disappointed. I stuck with it and on the 4th strip It really hit me how much whiter my teeth had gotten. The change was defiantly noticeable, so I stopped once my teeth reached the level of whiteness I wanted. I had about 4 strips after reaching that point that I use occasionally to re-whiten. Still not through the whole box and I purchased these a month ago (I use peroxide teeth whitening toothpaste daily, which is probably why they stay so white). I have sensitive teeth but found this product didn&#x27;t bother me, but everyone&#x27;s unique. I held the strips on my teeth for 40 minutes each time.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of the reviews before purchasing; they were a mixed bag.  I did not suffer any sensitivity issues (positive).  They fit my teeth well (positive).  They were a bit sticky to pull off; pried them gently (mild negative).  I saw no whitening effects (big negative).  Perhaps I should have done the photo thing of before and after.  Should I ever try this again, I will use a different product.</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with this product. It barely whitened my teeth and it caused a lot of sensitivity along the way. I believe the other white strip products (Professional Effects 20 ct, for example) are far more effective. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> The results from these strips--for me--nearly match what I can get from my dentist with a Zoom treatment. My teeth are noticeably whiter and brighter. I did say, \\&quot;nearly\\&quot; though and these strips don&#x27;t quite approach the luster one would get from a professional whitening treatment. But, for what you pay for the strips and what you&#x27;d pay at your dentist&#x27;s is such a drastic difference that these are more than worthwhile and I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Overall, these strips work as you would expect and do a good job of whitening.  I had two issues with this product that are causing me to give it three stars.  One, the strip size for the bottom teeth is small.  When will the makers of these products realize that some people have big smiles and therefore need a bigger strip to cover all the visible teeth?!  Second, I found that these strips were somewhat difficult to remove.  They really adhere to the teeth and I could foresee someone with less-than-nimble fingers having issues trying to remove this.  The taste is, of course, very peroxide-y but that is to be expected.  I would use this product again and recommend it to a friend if they were looking for an at-home, easy way to whiten but would definitely warn against difficult removal.</li>
    <li> These are strong.  They stick firmly to your teeth and don&#x27;t slide around.  When it&#x27;s time to take them off, you really have to pull.  That&#x27;s good because it means the gel on them stays where it&#x27;s supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does whiten teeth like they say.  After 15 minutes my teeth are too sore to do it again 24 hours later, so I waited two days in between applications.  It&#x27;s best to do it at night at least 8 hours before drinking coffee or wine that will stain your teeth afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that the bottom strip is not long enough.  It should cover more teeth.</li>
    <li> I have wanted white strips for some time.  For some reason I haven&#x27;t shelled out the money for them.  What a waste of time!    Available on Amazon, I took the ten strip plunge, and, boy, am I happy!    I wanted to give you a before and after presentation, but I botched the project.  Instead, I&#x27;ll just show you the results, which are stunning.  [...] Look at those pearly whites!  Where have they been hiding all these years?    Take my word for it, my before picture (which is hidden in the memory of a non-accessible camera) shows yellow stains, especially for the lower half of my teeth closest to the gums.  What a stunning difference!    I see it is listed at about $32.00, but now I see a reason to not only to use them, but use them regularly.  It has to be more reasonably priced than anything my memory serves me for any past dentists&#x27; office.</li>
    <li> they do hurt a bit, but not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;After 3 applications I stopped using them since there is literally no visible result.&lt;br /&gt;It does look like your teeth get whiter while you wear them - due to little bubbles underneath the film. But once you brush after each time you see no improvement.&lt;br /&gt;At least for me, I do not have horrible stains and my teeth look more or less good - maybe it help in those situations when colors are closer to brown....&lt;br /&gt;Yellowish color never gone away even a shade! In any case, I won&#x27;t use them again. Baking soda with lemon work lots better. It is not possible to get results ANY close to professional whitening.</li>
    <li> I heard from a professional that these compare to professional treatment and are much less expensive.  They are easy to use, no guessing what goes where.  Each packet contains a top and bottom strip and you apply the gel side to your teeth.  You are supposed to leave them on 30 minutes, and if you go past that it gets kind of hard to peel the plastic film off.&lt;br /&gt;There is a little bit of peroxidey taste but you don&#x27;t foam at the mouth or anything.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are a typical shade for a middle aged coffee drinker and annual chokecherry binger, and I just want a my teeth little lighter, not unnaturally white.  I just use them occasionally, like after chokecherry season and before my approximately 3 annual dress-up days, so I don&#x27;t know if you can get to Bidenwhite by using them consistently.&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion this is sensible easy to use product that can fit your lifestyle and maybe your budget.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> These whitestrips work very well. They are very easy to use. Wear once a day for 30 minutes, and you will have noticeably whiter teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many of crest&#x27;s whitening strips and products and none of them have disappointed. In fact, with this pack, I even skipped the last strip pack because I was so pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;The price can deter some people, but really how often are you (or should) you whiten your teeth each year? This more than justifies the price.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> These work great and are easy to use. Most importantly, I asked my dentist if whitening strips were safe for my teeth and he said yes and specifically recommended Crest Whitestrips. That&#x27;s all I really needed to know.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but am happy I have given it a try. My teeth look noticeably whiter after using this very easy-to-use product.</li>
    <li> after 3 days i noticed a visible difference. I would recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a cheaper fix than getting a oppointment</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an avid crest whitestrip user, however I took a few months hiatus due to the extreme sensitivity (&amp; pain) they were causing my teeth. I can finally eat ice cream again &amp; drink cold water after finding this high performance brand of whitestrips. I&#x27;m not sure if these are new, or they&#x27;ve been around before &amp; I never knew. (some people wrote it was a marketing ploy). either way--these definitely cause less sensitivity than the original crest whitestrips. I notice a huge difference not only in less (to minimal) pain but these brought my teeth to whiter shade(s) within days--rather over a week for the original crest whitestrips. I will definitely be buying again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive teeth, and brush everyday with sensodyne.  I used 2 strips about twice a week and had no sensitivity issue.  Would recommend</li>
    <li> I love whitening strips and I have used many different brands but these are only 50% good! The bottom strip is tiny, and will only cover a few of your bottom teeth, which makes the whitening pattern awful. I ended up just using two top strips for the upper and lower sets. What a waste of money and resources.</li>
    <li> No, they are nothing like a professional whitening, but I like to use these strips after I get my teeth cleaned every 6 months.  They assist in helping keep my teeth looking whiter, for longer, compared to not using them at all.  I moved up to the High Performance Whitestrips to see if they would actually make a difference over one of Crest&#x27;s other offerings.  They actually DO make a difference!  Not only in appearance, but useability, as well.  These strips don&#x27;t move around nearly as much as the ones I previously used and are a bit larger.  The whitening solution seems a bit milder, too.  I&#x27;ve never really experienced much sensitivity with whitestrips in general, although some people complain about it.  I will continue to use these after my scheduled cleanings for whiter teeth.  They just work!</li>
    <li> I am a skeptic, years ago I tried whitening strips but they just seemed to slip and slide all over the place.  Knowing that dental technology had to have dealt with that problem, I took a chance with Crest 3D Whitestrips.  Geez, what a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you have set them in place and waited the 30 minutes, you have to literally pry them off.  No wonder there are specific instructions in regards to loose teeth and implants.  Trust me, you will rip those things right out if you use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two curious things that I learned for the pamphlet that was enclosed - do not brush your teeth prior to using and do not use more than two kits in a year.  Not sure about the brushing part, but I guess the peroxide gel is a bit strong for more occasional use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice a bit of tingling this first time I used them, but after that I had no problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after all of that, how did it work?  Marvelously, did not notice anything after the first day or two, but on the morning of day 4, I looked in the rear view mirror of my car while backing up and my teeth caught me by surprise.  They were noticeably whiter.  I am a coffee and tea drinker and had little hope of a little blue box doing what it claimed - but I am sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the full 10 days, I believe they are well worth the cost and I will definitely be following up with another box in six months.</li>
    <li> I have always used crest strips to clean my teeth and I love them. They are easy to put on and I get good results.  My teeth do become lighter or brighter with each use, but I will be the first to confess that I do not use the entire 10 days supply.  I typically use five and then later in the year I use five more.  I feel that it brightens my teeth without making them that unusual white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are great and it is cheaper than going to the dentist. I have never had a problem with sensitivity from using this product, but of course everyone is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend for someone who wants a whiter smile but doesnt want to pay the big bucks to head to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I hope I dont sound anti dentist, I love mine!)</li>
    <li> I ordered these strips because I had yellow teeth, and I mean yellow. I&#x27;d never really considered using an over the counter product because you hear of so many scams so I was very leery about applying such a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the full 10 days of use I can say I&#x27;m astonished at my success. My teeth aren&#x27;t WHITE white, but they&#x27;re no longer yellow! I can smile without worrying about having my picture taken or looking like a diseased smoker. The product never hurt my teeth like I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I wish I could change is that, well, these are sorta for \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; teeth, something I don&#x27;t have. Because the strips don&#x27;t sink deep into crevices between misaligned teeth there are areas that don&#x27;t get reached. A touch up gel of some sort as an add-on would be a great feature.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many other crest whitening products &amp; I have never had a problem with tooth sensitivity before but these hurt for a full day after using them. I also didn&#x27;t see any difference in color. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This product is one of the few thay really does what it says it will fantastic product will recommend to all my friends</li>
