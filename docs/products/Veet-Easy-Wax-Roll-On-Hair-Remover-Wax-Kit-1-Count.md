      <li>So, this seemed like it would be a wonderful product.</li>
      <li>Which seems like a perfect time.</li>
      <li>The kit has everything you need to wax at home including a wonderful hand held electrical warmer that uses a disposable wax insert.  </li>
      <li>Wonderful!</li>
      <li>the best waxing kit I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
      <li>This was a wonderful idea.....</li>
      <li>and it was perfect,</li>
      <li>kit was awesome.  </li>
      <li>Perfect temp and consistency every time.  </li>
      <li>me, heating the mug of water for 2 minutes is ideal.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very nice and the oil wipes those are nice as well!!</li>
      <li>I absolutely loved the ease with which the wax went on, just the perfect amount and all the hair</li>
      <li>and she is very pleased!</li>
      <li>Wax strips that come along with the product is of great quality.</li>
      <li>The after-wax finishing clothes are so great that my skin has non irritation at all.</li>
      <li>I have used veet strips before and found them to be great</li>
      <li>This is a really great product.</li>
      <li>I am an experienced wax user</li>
      <li>Results were great.</li>
      <li>The waxes that are water soluble do not seem to do a great job of pulling the hair though..  </li>
      <li>wax itself isnt great - or maybe the papers, I dont</li>
      <li>The concept is GREAT -</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d used Veet creams before and had been happy with their quality and performance.  </li>
      <li>I thought this looked like a great idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great kit for those who want to wax at home.</li>
      <li>I had great results on my legs and lip, however on my arm</li>
      <li>I am an experienced waxer.</li>
      <li>And the wipes that come with it to remove the residue are amazing!</li>
      <li>LMAO!  </li>
      <li>The Veet Easy Wax Electrical Roll on Kit is an excellent dream.  </li>
      <li>At that point the wax is the perfect temperature and the application is as easy as swiping on deodorant.</li>
      <li>and I loved it when they have the microwax tub</li>
      <li>You have to know what your doing and be good at it</li>
      <li>After you wax, rinse off your legs with soap and water then moisturize with a good cream.</li>
      <li>Others have loved this.  </li>
      <li>not a sugar-coated \\&quot;just because I got it for free I&#x27;m gonna say how awesome it is\\&quot; review.</li>
      <li>I absolutely loved this.</li>
      <li>idea of it was good, but the execution of this product isn&#x27;t well thought out.  </li>
      <li>LOVED IT</li>
      <li>After reading the instructions once, your good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Luckily the Perfect Finish Wipes work well</li>
      <li>I have used home waxing kits before and was very pleased</li>
      <li>dispenser has to warm up before use, and mine took a good 45 minutes before the was was rollable.</li>
      <li>I threw a Veet house party and tested the wax right there on people who had never waxed with awesome results.  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried them all, and this is my favorite!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love!</li>
      <li>Great product and easy to use.</li>
      <li>think I gave this product an honest try.&lt;br</li>
      <li>You can do in the comfort of your own home during your leisure time.</li>
      <li>The finishing oil was nice</li>
      <li>/&gt;Alternately, I find an epliator, like the kind Braun makes, is the easiest</li>
      <li>The self-warming facet of the applicator is nice.</li>
      <li>but it does the job effectively and is a fraction of the cost.</li>
      <li>It just didnt work well no matter how warm</li>
      <li>Well I honestly doubt I&#x27;ll give this another go</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong--I could stand to spend more time on my appearance, but I&#x27;m just not any good with in-depth beauty regimens.</li>
      <li>I let it warm up for an hour.</li>
      <li>So basically I plugged it in and felt that it seemed to be getting warm.  </li>
      <li>I will say however that the clean up wipes worked great.  </li>
      <li>And the finishing wipes are helpful, but I was still washing wax off in the shower too; I think the wipes are great directly on the areas where you waxed to completion, but not so great on spots where wax was applied</li>
      <li>/&gt;So, easy, convenient, does a reasonably good job.  </li>
      <li>She says it is very easy to use and it does not hurt.</li>
      <li>the instructions were very easy to follow</li>
      <li>I prefer this method now, because it is actually very easy for waxing your legs.</li>
      <li>With the expense of the waxing system vs. using razor, I didn&#x27;t find the Veet system to be that much more effective.</li>
      <li>Perhaps better strips would help, but honestly, I think the formula of this wax has been tweaked to make it roll on, and something just is not working.</li>
      <li>I thought that this product worked well and so far has impressed me</li>
      <li>So yes they are better if you have time but the Veet roll on works great for a quick wax.  </li>
      <li>The instructions are very easy to understand and very IMPORTANT.</li>
      <li>not at all easy!</li>
      <li>to understand how to use and EASY to use!  </li>
      <li>Anyway, I&#x27;m a no-frills kind of girl though, so this product is probably best for a high-maintenance female.</li>
      <li>This kind of product is beyond expectations, it is well designed, excellent quality, works well with my wife, and she is totally happy.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, this product&#x27;s hype was just too good to be true.</li>
      <li>I Love This Easy Wax Kit!</li>
      <li>found Veet Easy Wax to be an effective way to remove hair and avoid shaving.</li>
      <li>and once it spreads easily but is not too warm go for it.</li>
      <li>If you follow the directions you will find this easy and effective.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The product did miss some spots but it could also be me, it seems like every time i use this the more the hair comes off.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this</li>
      <li>I did spots with more wax than others and results</li>
      <li>Probably, but this EasyWax Kit is better than that, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>had more hair on it, the strip or my leg.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad</li>
      <li>but I do plan on trying it for longer periods of time to see if it works better as I get used to it.</li>
      <li>Not so sure.</li>
      <li>The instructions say to leave it warm up for 30 min, if it doesn&#x27;t roll smooth, leave it longer.</li>
      <li>I love Veet</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also better than Nair&#x27;s wax strips....</li>
      <li>I used it 2 weeks ago...and today, I still have smooth legs!</li>
      <li>Simply love it and recimmend it 100%</li>
      <li>which is one of the many reasons I&#x27;d rather shave than wax</li>
      <li>I Absolutely Love this product!&lt;br</li>
      <li>After I watched the videos ,  I had  a better understanding of how to use waxing</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a lot for time-consuming fuss and bother to do something an epilator can do more efficiently and cheaper.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I got this box complimentary from Influester and Veet for testing purposes and since this is a test I want to give an honest opinion of what I think of this product....not a sugar-coated \\&quot;just because I got it for free I&#x27;m gonna say how awesome it is\\&quot; review. I followed every direction in the little booklet to the letter since I had really never waxed before and I wanted to make sure I did everything right. Well I plugged it in and the booklet says it takes about 30ish minutes to heat up...no big deal...but then mine wasn&#x27;t fully ready at the 30 minutes so I waited a little longer. It was a waiting game in a way....which is one of the many reasons I&#x27;d rather shave than wax I think because with this wax it took quite a while whereas I could shave and be done in no time. Well it finally heated up and I figured I&#x27;d do a tester spot first to see if I could deal with the pain that I had hear waxing usually incurs but when I did it nothing really happened. The first go around it didn&#x27;t take any hairs off and just left a sticky wax stripe mess on my leg. I wasn&#x27;t fully deterred by this so I gave it a few more tries...I got gradually better at it as time went on, but it still would leave hairs each time...it never really took them all off. That started to annoy me so eventually I just gave up. Oh and the next day I had these random red marks where it looked like it had damaged my skin a little bit....I didn&#x27;t really like that either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I gave this product an honest try.&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it for the price it&#x27;s at currently with the results I experienced? No most likely not.</li>
    <li> I had the privilege of reviewing this product courtesy of Influenster. It says for legs and bikini area, I used it on my lip, legs and arms. I had great results on my legs and lip, however on my arm I was left with splotches for the next few days on one arm. I am not sure why this happened and there was no reaction in the other areas I waxed. It takes about 45 minutes to heat up but you apply on and wax off, they even include extra wipes that you can use to wipe off excess wax! The whole kit is cheaper than going somewhere and getting waxed and the refill last for quite a few sessions! I will definitely be trying the product again.</li>
    <li> I received this product complimentary of Influenster for testing purposes . I have never waxed prior to receiving this kit , so I was very eager to test this product . I also watched several how -to wax tutorials prior to using the kit . After I watched the videos ,  I had  a better understanding of how to use waxing products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions were pretty easy to follow  : Clean area to be waxed (legs , arms , etc .) , dry area to be waxed  , and you are ready to wax .The instructions stated that the product would take 30 minutes to charge for use . If the wax was not coming out smooth or warm enough , the instructions stated to let the device charge for an additional 10-20 minutes . I charged my device for 30 minutes , and the wax was VERY sticky and was not warm enough for a proper waxing session . So , I decided to leave the device plugged in for an additional 10 minutes to \\&quot;warm\\&quot; up . When I went to unplug the device from the charger , it was literally too hot to handle  ! After 5-10 minutes ,  I unplugged the device  and tested the wax on a piece of paper (as stated on the instructions )  to see if the wax was ready . And guess what ? I had the same results from  the initial wax testing (at 30 minutes )  : it was way to sticky and definitely not ready to use for waxing .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am highly disappointed with the product and I do not recommend using this product AT ALL .</li>
    <li> ****I received this product for free from Influenster and Veet to try out and review.****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve used a lot of different wax kits. This was one of the worst. I&#x27;ve been waxing for years so I know the ins and outs. The strips the come with the kit are tiny little squares. Definitely not leg waxing strips unless you want to be waxing for several hrs. The instructions say to leave it warm up for 30 min, if it doesn&#x27;t roll smooth, leave it longer. An hr later and mine still wasn&#x27;t rolling smooth. After about 1 1/2 hrs I finally got it warm enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Sat down on the ground to do my waxing. The first pull is always the worst! With Veet, it&#x27;s HORRIBLE. I&#x27;ve seriously never had so much pain from a waxing kit before. The worst part is, it only got about half of the hair off my legs. You can&#x27;t go over the same spot twice, so I still had to shave. I made it halfway through one leg and was done. Complete waste of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I don&#x27;t recommend this kit to anyone.</li>
    <li> I received the Veet Easy Wax kit complimentary from Influenster. I was excited to try it. I love Veet products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, the Easy Wax kit isn&#x27;t any better than any other kit out there. I let it warm up for an hour. The wax was sticky, but did not take all of the hair off of my legs. Three hours later and my legs still sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea behind Easy Wax is a great one, though. There was definitely no mess and the directions were on point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I won&#x27;t be recommending it to friends.</li>
    <li> My Review:  it took me two times of trying to get this product to work.  The first time I followed the directions to the \\&quot;t\\&quot;, and it didn&#x27;t work at all.  So not wanting to waste the wax, strips, and the oiled wipes, I did some research on Youtube to get a video clip letting me see and hear what I was doing wrong.  After finding out I tried again 5 days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I tried I heated the wax for an hour and a half, and used the full length strips instead of cutting them smaller.  It worked, but hurt when my hair got pulled off.  I also ended up having to shave after I was done because I couldn&#x27;t get all my leg hair off.  Granted this isn&#x27;t my first waxing experience, but actually one of my more successful waxing experiences using at home products.  I have decided that I&#x27;m just not a waxer, and until I can afford to get laser hair removal, or someone gifts me that opportunity, I&#x27;ll just use razors to have smooth legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up because I actually got it to work, and if this is something you like then its a great new tool to use.&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs down because I don&#x27;t feel like there was enough products (oiled wipes, strips) and the directions were totally off on how long to heat the wax.</li>
    <li> Veet Easy Wax is as convenient as the name suggests. The setup is simple. You snap the wax cartridge into the warming unit and plug it in for 30-40 minutes. At that point the wax is the perfect temperature and the application is as easy as swiping on deodorant. The kit comes with plenty of cotton strips and after wax soothing wipes. I was able to wax my legs, arms, underarms, and bikini area with plenty of wax to spare.&lt;br /&gt;I found Veet Easy Wax to be an effective way to remove hair and avoid shaving. The process was quick. Although, I did need to go over some areas of my skin several times to ensure that all of the hair was removed. I liked the fact that I did not need to keep re-heating the wax as with some products and that it did not irritate my sensitive skin. I don&#x27;t know that I would go as far as to completely agree that this wax is salon quality but it does the job effectively and is a fraction of the cost. Depending on how quickly your hair grows back you should find a savings as opposed to razors, but without the frequent shaving, nicks, and ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly recommend this product, especially in conjunction with other Veet products specific to certain areas of your body. I didn&#x27;t find it that painful at all, just be sure to confidently pull the strips with quick movements. The only real drawback as with any product is having to grow the hair out in the first place, but I&#x27;m happy to be free from shaving for about a month each time I wax and this unit only requires hair to be 2mm long for removal. You can find this product at most major retailers, such as Walmart or Amazon for under $30: http://www.walmart.com/ip/Veet-Easy-Wax-Electrical-Roll-On-Kit-30-pc/22395137 or http://www.amazon.com/Veet-Easy-Wax-Roll-Count/dp/B00AN5LADI/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1371057656&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;veet+easy+wax  Refills are less than $10 as well.</li>
    <li> I worked in a salon for 5 years doing body waxing and used a system that looked and functioned very similar to this one. At first glance I was very impressed with the entire kit: the contents and the fact that it was a roll on (the first that I had seen outside of the salon.) I decided to try it out and let the product speak for itself. It did not disappoint. It went on very easily, the instructions were very easy to follow (walked beginners through exactly how to apply the wax and the strip) and the hair came off exactly like I had experienced in the salon. One note, make sure you apply the wax very liberally and keep it warm as I found that the thinner the wax went on and the colder it got (even after a few minutes unplugged) the less likely the hair was to come off with the strip. A few days later and the leg that I decided to just shave to compare with my waxed leg was noticeably prickly compared to my still-smooth Veet waxed leg :) A++++ in my book!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster, but all opinions are 100% my own</li>
    <li> I Love This Easy Wax Kit! Its So Easy To Use And Painless. Its Way Better Than Shaving. Now I Don&#x27;t Have To Shave My Legs Every Three Days. Wonderful!</li>
    <li> I received mines free thanks to influenster i didnt expect to have salon results. It did a pretty good job to say the least. It said it took 30 minutes before the wax heated up it actually took an hour. I expected pain but it wasnt bad at all it&#x27;s something i would use to maintain my waxes if i see stubbles here and there.</li>
    <li> It works as expected, but Is very messy.  I would rather go to the salon and have my waxing done.</li>
    <li> Messy, less than good results and I have wax stuck  to me that won&#x27;t  come  off.</li>
    <li> Regardless of how long I let it heat up, it never really melted well enough to get a good hold.  So it turned out to be a mess to clean up.  And waste ot time.  Totally bummed.</li>
    <li> I was not happy with this at all didn&#x27;t get hot enough and the wax didn&#x27;t roll on like they say it goes I tried it couple different times thinking I was doing something wrong and even watched the video.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the wax strips from this brand before and I definitely like THIS better.</li>
    <li> I thought this product was decent, I have tried many many and I have waxed my legs for over 10 years and other than the fact that does not stay warm all the time, I was able to wax in a very short time and without any trouble. The roller it&#x27;s a lot bigger than most of the ones out there, the stand it&#x27;s very nice and the oil wipes those are nice as well!! If the warmer would keep the wax just a little warmer a 5 starts without a doubt, for the price though I can&#x27;t really complain. The replacements are a bit expensive another reason why  it only got 4. Still cheaper than the salon and better than any other brands out there!</li>
    <li> This product is bad. It looks like it had been used before and un hygienic. Will return it back.</li>
    <li> I like the idea of this kit a lot. The heater is nifty, and the wax insert and rollers are fun. However... in practice it does not work out as well as I&#x27;d like, and is much harder than comparable products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dispenser has to warm up before use, and mine took a good 45 minutes before the was was rollable. It&#x27;s very, very sticky wax--which is what you want, of course, but it makes application tricky. Then, you apply the strips, and pull them off, and the strips are not usable again. There are wipes to remove excess wax, but they&#x27;re this horrible oily turpentine-like substance, because the wax is so sticky!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to spread stuff on your legs, and use strips to pull it off, I think a surgaring product like Nads is far superior. No warm up, reusable strips, cleans up with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternately, I find an epliator, like the kind Braun makes, is the easiest method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this home waxing kit was the only option, it&#x27;d do. But there are better solutions.</li>
    <li> Others have loved this.  It is OK... Does not get very hot, takes a long time.  It is hard to see where the wax goes but it is easier than putting it on with sticks.</li>
    <li> the worst junk ever.  it is very gooey and does not remove the hair. i just don&#x27;t know what the roll on thing is about. it just doesn&#x27;t do what it says it does.</li>
    <li> This product was so annoying and painful.&lt;br /&gt;It took almost an hour to heat up (says it takes 30)&lt;br /&gt;I applied it to my legs, and it was very painful and took out almost no hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;I reapplied the area 4 times, and it is still not hair free.&lt;br /&gt;I had red blotchy skin, with purple dots all over.&lt;br /&gt;Terrible product.&lt;br /&gt;Looks so nice and easy in the commercials, its the exact opposite.</li>
    <li> I love it! Great product and easy to use. I met this product in Europe on my vacation last year. When I back at home I looking for it. Now I found and I&#x27;m so happy!</li>
    <li> The concept is GREAT - I love the idea of a roll-on mess-free home waxing kit.  The wax, however, doesn&#x27;t stick to the hair making it completely ineffective.</li>
    <li> I love this kit!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this at the store and then came home and read the reviews - I was really nervous and I almost returned it. I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;I let the unit heat for about an hour then tried it on paper like the instructions say, it worked perfectly, so I started on my legs. The wax went on easily and evenly. The pain on removal was equal to or less than professional waxes I&#x27;ve had. Less painful than other home kits. Results were great. Because the wax goes on so thin, I was able to do my entire lower leg with just one strip. The finishing oil was nice but I&#x27;d prefer a little bottle over the crunchy wipe it comes on. It started cooling, so I plugged it back in to heat up before I started my other leg. Applying the wax to this leg was a little more awkward, so I did have some trouble a couple times with getting all the hair off, but I just redid those spots at the end.&lt;br /&gt;My legs today are less irritated than with other home waxing kits or professional waxes.&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy with this kit I really felt compelled to sit down and write a review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all, and this is my favorite!  So much easier that dealing with a microwave! Perfect temp and consistency every time.  Temperature stays consistent throughout the process.  No wooden spreaders, which are messy and make it hard to get the wax the right thickness -- you want it VERY thin to avoid pulling your skin as well as the hair. Yes, it takes time to heat; just plug it in ahead of time.  I find it super fast and hands down the best method I&#x27;ve used.  And way cheaper than going to a salon.  Read up on technique.  It&#x27;s important to pull parallel to the skin, not pulling up away from the skin, and FAST.  Make sure your legs are clean, and go over them with a little alcohol on a pad to be sure they are free of oils.  No lotion on skin beforehand. If you follow the directions you will find this easy and effective.</li>
    <li> This product sucks!!  I have used home waxing kits before and was very pleased so I was excited when I purchased this but it did not work.</li>
    <li> I have used veet before and I loved it when they have the microwax tub was. Why they stopped making that heavens knows but it was the best product I could find for my coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product from Veet and it should have been a really easy to use product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wax did not heat up even after 30 to 40 mins of leaving it on. When I tried to roll it - was very painful as there was not enough \\&quot;wax\\&quot; to create a layer over the hair. So instead the roller was pulling my hair off. Ugggh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well i threw it out into the dust bin. Looking for another product that actually works.</li>
    <li> The consistency of the wax is horrible. It hurts when applying (more than when removing the hair). It is like trying to stretch sticky bubble-gum over skin, instead of smooth wax which should glide on. I heated the gum-wax for over 40 minutes before first trying it. As it was so difficult to apply, I then continued to leave the device plugged into the power while using it but that didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found that due to its thick, gummy consistency, it didn&#x27;t cover the hair properly but instead tended to stick to my skin. Pulling the gum-wax off when trying to remove the hair has left red blood blisters and blotches all over my legs. It took ages for me to only use it on my upper legs, mainly because the gum-wax was so difficult to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely going to return this product and ask for my money back. The warming device is a great idea but the gum-wax in the product is so awful I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product. I really dislike shaving so I began waxing. I&#x27;ve used microwaveable roll-on wax products and they&#x27;ve worked very well, but I decided to try something new and buy this product. I thought it would be more convenient since it is self-heating, but that is not so. I believe the packaging said that it &amp;#34;heats up in thirty minutes&amp;#34; but it actually took two hours for mine to heat up. I even tried different outlets, but the result was the same. When the wax was heated up enough, I applied it to my legs just as the directions said, applied the wax strips and ripped them off. The wax had trouble pulling the hairs off and instead just stuck to my leg. I even tried waxing after applying powder to my legs and the same result occurred. Frustrated, I just decided to wipe off the wax residue on my legs. I would like to say that the wipes that came with this smelled strange and did not work at all. In the end I just rinsed off my still-hairy legs with hot water and oil and that was that.</li>
    <li> It was one the worst 4 weeks of my life trying to grow out my leg hairs to get it long enough to wax. I had to pick out the tiny hairs with a tweezer. The waxing sheets weren&#x27;t enough for even 3 sessions</li>
    <li> This kind of product is beyond expectations, it is well designed, excellent quality, works well with my wife, and she is totally happy.&lt;br /&gt; I totally recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Fairly easy to use. Pain is the same as any other waxing. Time to heat the stick could be shorter. But does the job. Not sure it should be as expensive as it is.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t buy it! not at all easy!</li>
    <li> When in a pinch you can purchase the refills for this electric warmer, heat a mug of water in the microwave and then set the refill into the hot water for a few minutes.  This is very easy and quick.  test the wax an a small spot of your skin and once it spreads easily but is not too warm go for it. After you roll it on place the roller back into the hot water so it doesn&#x27;t cool off too much while you use the strips to remove the wax and hair then move on to the next area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, heating the mug of water for 2 minutes is ideal. DO NOT PUT THE REFILL IN THE MICROWAVE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, easy, convenient, does a reasonably good job.  The electric warmer is just a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons? No more than most products.  It is not water soluble so you must be careful with it.  It is a pain to get off of counter tops, clothing etc. The waxes that are water soluble do not seem to do a great job of pulling the hair though..  After you wax, rinse off your legs with soap and water then moisturize with a good cream. I use cetaphil or aveeno.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The microwavable body wax kits that are soft when hot but then hard when they cool (no strips needed.  Nair makes a decent one) do a better job than these that are used with the strips but getting them to the right temperature can be a pain. So yes they are better if you have time but the Veet roll on works great for a quick wax.  I can do legs and bikini line in 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Mine didn&#x27;t warm up the wax enough to allow roller to turn! And, of course, since box is opened, there&#x27;s no refund of my money.</li>
    <li> this was not as promised by advertising...the wax was sticky and was extremely difficult to spread on desired areas and did not efficiently remove the hair!  I will continue to use my epilating system.</li>
    <li> This was a wonderful idea.....finally a way to wax without the mess!  But the unit doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to spread the wax.  It says to have it plugged in for 30 minutes.  I had mine plugged in for 1 1/2 hours and it still didn&#x27;t work well.  I&#x27;m not new to waxing. It didn&#x27;t work. I THREW THE WHOLE THING IN THE GARBAGE.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> The wax takes forever to get warm (and it is not war enough), therefore it is hard for the roller to roll.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> Ready to use in couple of minutes, easy to use and remove the hair very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the only way to make it better is to change the Strips by Washables Strips.</li>
    <li> This is by far the worst waxing product I&#x27;ve ever used. Not only did it not do the job, but it also damaged my skin. I am an experienced wax user so I am confident that this was not due to my misuse of the product, but rather due to the composition of the wax, which sticks to the skin like glue - and then burns or peels parts of skin. I will not use it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this without reading any reviews- and thank goodness or I would have never bought it! I&#x27;ve had my legs waxed a lot by professionals (and some less than professionals) and I find this way the LEAST painful. I&#x27;ve watched how they&#x27;ve done it so that certainly helps me to know what I&#x27;m doing. Otherwise, PLEASE research how to wax before you try doing it yourself. (Wish I told this to 17 year old me..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is less than that of any salon or professional you can find where I live- at less than half the cost for the starter kit. I wish it came with more cloth strips though, because I&#x27;ve run out before I&#x27;ve run out of wax. And seriously, it wasn&#x27;t painful at all, even though I was very nervous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plugged it in,showered and dried my legs, applied baby powder, ended up waiting a bit (a total of 45 minutes instead of the suggested 20) for the wax to heat up and then moisuturized...voila, smooth legs within the hour!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seriously seriously recommend this to people who have had salon waxes and want to save some money (and time). I prefer this method now, because it is actually very easy for waxing your legs.</li>
    <li> BACKGROUND:&lt;br /&gt;- I am an experienced waxer. I&#x27;ve been waxed and sugared professionally, and I&#x27;ve tried at least half a dozen home wax solutions.&lt;br /&gt;- I have fair skin (I&#x27;m the \\&quot;sometimes tans, usually burns\\&quot; skin type) and blonde hair, which ranges from basically clear in some spots to light brown in others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS of this kit:&lt;br /&gt;- The self-warming facet of the applicator is nice. One of the worst parts of home wax kits is the repeated trips back and forth to the microwave...not to mention the fact that it&#x27;s easy to get the wax too hot if you&#x27;re nuking it.&lt;br /&gt;- The fact that you can simply roll the wax on is convenient. It&#x27;s pretty easy to keep the wax from getting on parts of your body where you don&#x27;t want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON of this kit:&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t work any better than any other home wax kit I&#x27;ve tried. I had it at the proper temperature, applied it in the proper direction (with the grain), ripped it off against the grain, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it in 3 different areas--1, the bikini area; 2, the front of my shin, where the growth is sparse but individual hairs are thickest and easiest to pull out; and 3, the outside of my calf, where the growth is thicker but the individual hairs are thinner/fairer--and each time, it removed only about 25-30% of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a terrible product, but given how poor the success rate was for removal, I wouldn&#x27;t spend money on it in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d found this to be pretty messy; getting the wax out of the applicator was like getting glue out of Ban Roll-On. It just didnt work well no matter how warm it got.&lt;br /&gt;The wax itself isnt great - or maybe the papers, I dont know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This takes a simple concept and just makes it incredibly complex. Maybe I&#x27;m just oldschool, but I&#x27;ll just continue to get it professionally done or get the blade.</li>
    <li> I sampled this product on my legs so that I&#x27;d know whether or not to bother with the more sensitive areas like underarms &amp; bikini, which Veet suggests you do as well. It did it&#x27;s job for sure, but I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;m better off just shaving with a razor like normal (especially now that the shaving cream is built-in these days). Mainly because of the time it takes to warm up the wax (30 minutes) plus the time it takes to then apply the wax (it rolls on slowly). Also, I do have really sensitive skin, &amp; I wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable waxing my underarms or bikini line considering the irritation that I see on my legs still 1-2 days later. No bumps, but red spots nonetheless (&amp; itchy). And they state you can reuse the wax strips, which I did, but then it&#x27;s a sticky mess (unless they meant to rinse &amp; dry them before reuse; I just applied the other side to a different area on my leg after removing it from elsewhere). By the way, that&#x27;s why the box indicates 24 strips while consumers only count 12 (again, dual sides). And the finishing wipes are helpful, but I was still washing wax off in the shower too; I think the wipes are great directly on the areas where you waxed to completion, but not so great on spots where wax was applied but you didn&#x27;t end up using a hair-removal strip there. Anyway, I&#x27;m a no-frills kind of girl though, so this product is probably best for a high-maintenance female. Don&#x27;t get me wrong--I could stand to spend more time on my appearance, but I&#x27;m just not any good with in-depth beauty regimens. Waxing for me is no different than products I&#x27;ve tried that supposedly dissolve the hair per a chemical lotion or extract the hair per a sandpaper-like brush; they&#x27;re all more fuss than they&#x27;re worth, really.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer - I typically use hard wax, although I have used strips, but the lack of microwave has left me warming the container on a coffee mug heating pad to melt. So, this seemed like it would be a wonderful product. It is easy to use - plug the wax roll in, plug the unit in the wall, and a half hour later it is ready to use, it stayed ready as well. I would simply plug it in after I applied it. It does roll on fairly easily, especially compared to jar products, which I really appreciated. However, it never stuck well enough to the strips to actually pull out hairs effectively and efficiently. Perhaps better strips would help, but honestly, I think the formula of this wax has been tweaked to make it roll on, and something just is not working. I found it took more than double my normal wax time and left a ridiculous amount of hairs behind. I had to follow up a day later with my usual kit [[ASIN:B001A43ELC Surgi-wax Brazilian Waxing Kit For Private Parts, 4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)]], and the hairs came right out. YMMV, but I am very disappointed in this promising product. I really wanted it to work.</li>
    <li> I have used all kinds of hair removal products, including professional waxing and laser, and many others at home. This product was such a joke. I threw it straight in the trash after trying to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way this is supposed to work is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;Plug in heater, heat up wax.&lt;br /&gt;Roll wax on to desired area (this one only comes with a leg/body application, I guess a different sized applicator is needed for other areas).&lt;br /&gt;Apply paper.&lt;br /&gt;Tear off.&lt;br /&gt;Repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried waxing my underarms and legs. It states the hair must be at least 1/6 of an inch long, and no more than 1/2 in. Mine fell between those parameters certainly (underarm, I&#x27;d guess about 3/8. Leg 1/6), but I&#x27;d guess it pulled maybe 4 hairs out. The hairs it did remove were baby-fine peach fuzz, not the dark ones I intended. My underarm still hurts and is still just as hairy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax is:&lt;br /&gt;Too stretchy. It doesn&#x27;t rip cleanly away, it stretches, defeating the purpose of waxing completely.&lt;br /&gt;Too cold. The built in warmer sat for nearly an hour, twice as long as it suggests, and it still barely rolled on.&lt;br /&gt;Too thin. The roller rolls such a thin layer (and the instructions tell you DO NOT ROLL BACK OVER AN AREA YOU HAVE ALREADY GONE OVER many times, so I daren&#x27;t).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing about this package was the clean up wipes that came with it. They were very effective at getting wax off skin, what was left of it, since my attempt left the hair but tore away a good amount of my skin with the waxing sheet.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this at-home waxing kit. The concept seems great -- a small portable wax system that you can roll on. However, when I used it to wax my legs, I had some difficulties. First of all, it took a really long time for the wax to warm up enough to roll on (about 45 minutes). Once I started rolling it on, I made some mistakes by putting too much on at once. My suggestion would be to apply it and remove it in small amounts in a very organized manner. This, of course, was user error. Once I got going however, I realized I had to apply and reapply the wax to the same section at least two times to remove all the hair. This is either because the wax didn&#x27;t grab enough or wasn&#x27;t warm enough. I went through the wax removal sheets provided really really quickly and could have used at least twice as much (and this was just for one leg.) This means that you really can&#x27;t rely on the paper provided kit -- you&#x27;ll need to purchase it independently and get a lot of it. To see if the results lasted longer, I shaved one leg and waxed the other. I found that the waxed leg didn&#x27;t stay smoother that much longer than the shaved leg  (I was expecting to be \\&quot;hair free\\&quot; for a few weeks or so). With the expense of the waxing system vs. using razor, I didn&#x27;t find the Veet system to be that much more effective. I also thought it might be hard to wax underarms by yourself -- help might be required. I&#x27;m going to try the system again and see if it works better the second or third time around but my initial enthusiasm was dampened. At this point, I&#x27;m not sure I would recommend the product but I do plan on trying it for longer periods of time to see if it works better as I get used to it.</li>
    <li> For those that are fond of waxing this may be a useful product for you; I however am a reluctant waxer.  I thought that the easy wax-heating, even temperature and strips would make it more palatable.  For me, it did not;-the only thing that resonates with me is OUCH!  The kit itself is easy to use; drastically less mess than with other waxing products that I have tried.  The wait time for the wax to heat up was a bit irritating but overall this seems like a good product for those that are traditional wax users.</li>
    <li> I got this to review through the amazon vine program.  I was excited to have a heating wax system that would make it easier to put wax on uniformly when waxing.  I thought this looked like a great idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions for this are absolutely atrocious.  I mean most of it is self-explanatory, but there are absolutely no instructions on how to put the wax cartridge into the heating unit. I think I figured it out, but who knows if it is actually in there right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no indicators on the unit to let you know that it is on and heating, there are also no indicators to let you know if the wax has reached the desired temp.  So basically I plugged it in and felt that it seemed to be getting warm.  So I left it sit for 30 minutes or so and then came back to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty much impossible to get the roller started, I ended up pushing the roller around with my fingers until it was covered with wax and would grab my skin.  This resulted in my fingers getting all goopy with wax...which was really obnoxious.  The roller part also isn&#x27;t heated, so the wax cools on the roller and gets all sticky and gloppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax in this thing really pulled on your skin hard to turn the roller.  It was very hard to roll on, the wax is incredibly tacky and just would not roll on smoothly.  It ended up going on my legs as a streaky and uneven mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A body wax cartridge is included (there are apparently bikini wax cartridges as well, but this didn&#x27;t include one of those).  There are also cloth strips included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have waxed numerous times before and know the procedure: place wax down in direction of hair, rub cloth strip down in direction of hair, quickly peel off against hair direction.  I did this on my leg and it was a disaster.  The wax pulled on skin painfully and left my leg red and swollen, but none of the hair pulled off.  It was like the wax actually adhered better to my skin than my hair.  To make matters worse the next morning I had a blotchy bruising where I did this on my leg that still hasn&#x27;t healed. This is all a bit bizarre I have never had a waxing product do this before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just absolutely the worst waxing product I have ever used.  I recommend [[ASIN:B0002PU864 Parissa Quick And Easy Wax Strips Face and Bikini 16 Strip(s)]] and [[ASIN:B009SDUPLO Sally Hansen Salon Sugar Wax Hair Remover Kit for Face]].  Both of these products work better for removing hair on face and legs than this horrible kit.the next morning I had a blotchy bruising where I did this on my leg that still hasn&#x27;t healed.

    <li> I received the Veet Easy Wax kit complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster.  It was easy to use but was time consuming.  It takes a long time for the wax to heat up so make sure to read the directions and plan ahead. Great kit for those who want to wax at home.</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary Veet Easy Wax unit through Influenster.com and I am not impressed.  After allowing the wax to heat for the recommended time period I found that it was difficult to dispense and not nearly as viscous as it needed to be to be effective.  The unit was hard to roll across my skin, and it didn&#x27;t leave enough wax to be able to really pull any hairs away.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product--shaving is much easier than trying to use this.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this kit!&lt;br /&gt;It comes with the wax and an electric wax heater that works so well!&lt;br /&gt;I would let the wax heat up for a bout 20 mins before applying.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part is the smell.&lt;br /&gt;It actually smells good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster.</li>
    <li> I had to let my hair grow longer then I was used to but it did work better then past waxing products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;Not a BIG MESS, like others.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to understand how to use and EASY to use!  Really like how it is a roller instead of a jar, and it&#x27;s self warming no microwaving it too long or not long enough.&lt;br /&gt;This is defiantly a brand new way to wax!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If waxing is for you or even never tried it before, then THIS is the way to go, you will never want to use another one, ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received this product complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.influenster.com/review/veet-easywax-electrical-roll-on-kit</li>
    <li> I tried this product on three separate occasions as the box says you might have to wax a few times to become proficient at it. The wax took an hour to warm up enough to roll on, and then it was hard to roll on an even layer. When one a the few strips was applied it pulled just a few hairs off and I was really disappointed. I ended up having to shave anyway and my skin felt really irritated from all the fuss. I love the idea of this product, but unfortunately it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I have a moderate amount of experience with waxing, electrolysis, and epilation as methods of hair removal.  I have never tried self-waxing, though,and if this Veet Easy Wax Roll On Kit is any indication of the standards one can expect from these types of products, I believe I&#x27;ll stick to professional waxing, thank you very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a good half hour to get the wax melted using their roll on device.  The stand that it sits on while melting is rather flimsy.  Once the wax is ready to use it goes on smoothly and easily.  But the device cools quickly, causing the wax to reharden.  This kit came with just 12 strips, which is really not enough, particularly if you need to rewax to pick up stray hairs.  After you are done waxing you have to use one of their \\&quot;finishing pads\\&quot; to get the remaining wax off.  There were only 5 such pads in my kit, again, not enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a lot for time-consuming fuss and bother to do something an epilator can do more efficiently and  cheaper.</li>
    <li> Prologue: Having never waxed before, I was eager to test this out. I&#x27;m no dummy, so figured I could do this pretty easily, although perhaps not at a pro-waxer&#x27;s level. Oh, how innocent I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter 1: I have tried, on three separate occasions, to use Veet&#x27;s so-called \\&quot;EasyWax\\&quot; kit, but it has tried, and then pushed way past the threshold of, my patience. The single, largest problem is in heating the wax. To put it simply, it doesn&#x27;t work. The directions (which aren&#x27;t that all that helpful, I might add) say to plug it in for thirty minutes, with the possible addition of ten to twenty more minutes, for a total of fifty minutes. Well that wasn&#x27;t hot enough to get it to roll smoothly. I didn&#x27;t have the time to wait longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter 2: On the next occasion I let it heat for an hour and a half, checking on it periodically. Still no go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter 3: On the third try, I left it on for THREE HOURS!!! Did the wax finally roll smoothly? No, it did not. While I did attempt to wax during this trial, the results were dismal, probably due to the wax not being hot enough. So there goes Veet&#x27;s claim that it keeps the wax at the right temperature and it&#x27;s simple and easy to use. Ha! It may have ripped out three hairs (maybe) and left my skin sticky and irritated. Yeah, thanks for nothing. Luckily the Perfect Finish Wipes work well and I was able to clean myself up easily. What do I have to do next, leave it on for five hours? Ten?! Well I honestly doubt I&#x27;ll give this another go, it&#x27;s just not worth the irritation. Three strikes and you&#x27;re out, Veet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epilogue: I ended up shaving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several different at home waxing kits.  I&#x27;ve used Nad&#x27;s (didn&#x27;t like), Sally Hansen (total waste of money), and Poetic Wax (which can be messy but did work fairly well)[[ASIN:B00023579E Bliss Poetic Waxing Kit]].  When I read the description of the new Veet Easy Wax roll on I was very hopeful that this could be exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin with, the new Veet product takes waaaay longer to heat the wax then what the directions say, and it would have been better if you could use it while plugged in, but the cord is to short. At least it was for me for where I need to plug it in, and where I was using it (I&#x27;m not an acrobat).  I would plan on spending between 1.5-2 hours warming the wax before using (maybe longer) . So after waiting forever for it to be usable, unplugging to use it, then plugging in again to reheat again so that I could reapply, repeat repeat....it was a vicious cycle and it took way longer than I have time for especially considering that it only removed about 25% of the hair in the area I was attempting to wax (my lower leg).  If I&#x27;m going to spend that much time doing hair removal it better be closer to 100% effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea of it was good, but the execution of this product isn&#x27;t well thought out.  When I did get it to work, it only removed about 25% of the hair.  There weren&#x27;t enough strips included in the kit to do the job. I wonder if they even tested this with real people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said before I&#x27;ve used a variety of home waxing systems and been disappointed each time.  This experience was no different.  A big dud.  I will say however that the clean up wipes worked great.  I don&#x27;t know if they sell these separately or not, but they should.  That&#x27;s the only thing in this kit that would be worth buying again.  I would have actually given this one star, but I like the clean up wipes enough that they got their own star :)</li>
    <li> I Absolutely Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;i am an at home waxer, and typically used sally hansen products, effective but messy.  I have also used avon wax kits, also messy!  having to microwave the wax, which them gets cold quickly is such a hassle!&lt;br /&gt;This kit was awesome.  I threw a Veet house party and tested the wax right there on people who had never waxed with awesome results.  I absolutely loved the ease with which the wax went on, just the perfect amount and all the hair comes right off!&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that there arent enough strips given, but other than that...perfect 10!</li>
    <li> Easy wax roll kit? Not so sure. This was really not easy to use and just created a mess. Not worth the effort or the time.</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed in the Veet Easy Wax Roll On Kit. I received it complementary from Influenster and was very shocked to find that it was already melted on the roller because of shipping. I plugged it in and let it heat up for the time on the box (30 minutes instead of the 20 that the packet insert said). When I went to use it, it made the thinnest layer of wax possible. It wasn&#x27;t even enough to hold a piece of wax strip. I had to roll it on 3 or 4 times to get an even layer and at that point, it was more painful to roll the wax then to rip the strip off. Again, disappointed when only a few pieces of hair came off. I have used veet strips before and found them to be great but this product just didn&#x27;t cut it for me really.</li>
    <li> I received this product complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster. I was very interested in trying out an at home waxing system. I thought that this product worked well and so far has impressed me there are however a few things that I think could be improved. First off--you need to give yourself time to get it done properly. You won&#x27;t be able to complete this in a quick 15 minutes, you need to let the wax heat up and it took about 20-25 minutes for that. I would also provide more strips since I have wax left, but little strips maybe double the amount? Just a suggestion. I definitely will use this in the future since I thought it was quite well for an at home system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again to Veet and Influenster for allowing me to test this new product. I suggest if you are looking for an at home kit to try this one on for size, not a bad price and quite a nice system.</li>
    <li> It takes a good half hour to get the wax melted using their roll on device. The stand that it sits on while melting is rather flimsy. Once the wax is ready to use it goes on smoothly and easily. But the device cools quickly, causing the wax to reharden. This kit came with just 12 strips, which is really not enough, particularly if you need to rewax to pick up stray hairs. After you are done waxing you have to use one of their \\&quot;finishing pads\\&quot; to get the remaining wax off. There were only 5 such pads in my kit, again, not enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a lot for time-consuming fuss and bother to do something an epilator can do more efficiently and cheaper.</li>
    <li> The instructions say it may take a few tries to get proficient at using this product. I gave it a few tries and it was a waste of my time. I should have paid closer attention to the reviews that warned of long warm up times and whatnot, but even with an extended warm up time, I couldn&#x27;t get more than a few hairs removed. Please don&#x27;t bother with this product.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product. You can do in the comfort of your own home during your leisure time. The instructions are very easy to understand and very IMPORTANT. After reading the instructions once, your good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INSTRUCTIONS in short: Apply the wax after 30 min of heating in the direction of your hair, then the wax strip and smooth, once all smoothed out pull off in the opposite direction. Use the veet finishing oil to remove the stickiness of wax residue. Then you should have soft smooth legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product did miss some spots but it could also be me, it seems like every time i use this the more the hair comes off. So dont shut it down before you try it, because practice makes perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: Got this free from influenster for testing purposes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d used Veet creams before and had been happy with their quality and performance.  This was my first time to use a home waxing kit and I was looking forward to testing Veet out.  Unfortunately, it wasn&#x27;t a success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could be that I needed to heat the wax longer than the 45 minutes.  I was able to test some of the wax on my lower leg which isn&#x27;t very hairy.  While it did take out some of the leg hair, it wasn&#x27;t able to take everything off in one go.  I&#x27;ll give the Easy Wax Roll On Kit a few more tries but I&#x27;m not that enthusiastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should say that the wipes work well - they get rid of the sticky residue immediately.</li>
    <li> I usually love Veet products and this one was pretty decent. There are a few issues. The wax takes too long to heat up and there are not enough strips. However, in my experience no wax kit ever gives you enough strips. I think the other disappointed reviews could be user error. Waxing at home is not easy and always messy. You have to know what your doing and be good at it, that&#x27;s why most people pay salons to do it. If you know what you&#x27;re doing, this wax kit is pretty decent.</li>
    <li> I got the Veet Easy Wax Roll On Kit for my 17 year old daughter and she is very pleased! She says it is very easy to use and it does not hurt. The skin felt smooth after use.</li>
    <li> It is hard to use. Does not roll on well misses sections.  not enough papers included, papers do not take off the wax completely.&lt;br /&gt;leaves legs sticky.</li>
    <li> Saw a \\&quot;good\\&quot; review in a magazine and thought I would try it. It took forever for the wax to melt, but did not seem to be melted completely. It was so hard to roll on. And most importantly, it did not remove the hair. It took off a few. Had to shave after I used it.</li>
    <li> At first glance, it doesn&#x27;t look like there is enough wax to pull up anything. Well, it&#x27;s enough. There were some swipes that I went over once more giving me 2 layers of wax, but I&#x27;d say that it wasn&#x27;t completely necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On average, I use 3 strips [of any brand] on each leg. This was the same with the Veet Kit. I was also able to re-use the wax after the initial application. This helped with any stray hairs left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, compared to other waxing products I have used in the past, it&#x27;s great. It is better than Veet&#x27;s wax strips but equal to the Nads wax strips and Nads gel. It&#x27;s also better than Nair&#x27;s wax strips....is there one more brand I&#x27;m missing? Probably, but this EasyWax Kit is better than that, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this a 4 out of 5 on my scale just because it still left a few strays, which is what most at-home wax kits will do. It also depends on your hair and how long/thick it is.</li>
    <li> I have received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing and review purposes. There are definitely some hits and misses with this product. What I really like about this product is that it does keep my legs smooth for at least 3 weeks. The kit is very easy and simple to use, and the electrical warmer kept the wax at the right temperature throughout the entire waxing session. What I didn&#x27;t like about this product is that it did not remove my hair 100%. I maybe got 85-90% off of it, and with the rest, I had to shave. This kit is also a bit messy to use due to the fact that the waxing strips aren&#x27;t thick enough to be used several times per session. The wax ended up leaking through and got on my hands as I was rubbing on the strips to adhere it to the wax. Besides, the instruction can also be a bit more accurate, especially when it comes to the time needed for heating the wax. On the instruction leaflet, it says 30 mins; however, it took me about 60-75 mins just to get the wax to flow smoothly and be ready to use. This waxing system is very time consuming, and it is not for people who wants to just \\&quot;wax and go\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> The Veet Easy Wax Electrical Roll on Kit is an excellent dream.  But that is all it is; a dream for instant hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I am a brunette and have very coarse hair.  I first tried this product on my legs.  Aside from it being quite painful, the hair was not removed.  In order for the wax to actually catch the hairs, I would have to go weeks without shaving my legs.  And that is just not feasible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facial hair? Forget about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Armpit hair? No way would I even think about not shaving there for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Veet advertises that the wax is easily heated; not true.  It took way longer than the few minutes touted on the package.  Once the wax was finally heated, it was easy to put on my legs.  It was getting it off of my legs that was tough.  It was painful and very very sticky.  I can&#x27;t bring myself to try it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just can&#x27;t recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natalie S. for Amazon Vine</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing all my life, It has always been messy and horrible but this roll-on is by far the best waxing kit I&#x27;ve tried! No mess, great rsults in less than 15 minutes, I will never use any other waxing method! The after-wax finishing clothes are so great that my skin has non irritation at all. Simply love it and recimmend it 100%</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say that my experience with this product left something to be desired. I was never good at waxing and thought maybe this would be different. On the plus side, there is a handy little warming station that you plug in to warm the wax, and the kit comes with strips that you apply over the wax, special cleansing sheet to remove excess wax, etc.  My problem was that when I pulled on the wax strip to remove the hair it simply didn&#x27;t work. The sticky wax was left remaining along with the hair.  I&#x27;m not saying there is anything wrong with the product.  I am simply here to warn you not to expect miracles.  The product comes with instructions that apparently must be followed to a &#x27;T&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and read other reviews to get a well rounded perspective. As for me, I am sticking with my battery charged electric razor.</li>
    <li> This kit takes the mess out of waxing.  You don&#x27;t need a pot of wax or an applicator stick.  You just put the wax refill into the machine, plug it in and wait 30+ minutes for the wax to melt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then you roll the applicator to put down a line of wax, smooth the cloth and rrriiiiiippp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions were easy to follow and the unit worked as I expected.  I have only used it on my legs and forearms because I am too much of a wuss to wax my underarms or bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this is not meant for use on the face, I did try it on my upper lip but it didn&#x27;t work as well there, probably because the roller is too big to get the wax on right.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to use and is not very effective.</li>
    <li> I am not a waxing virgin; I&#x27;ve done it once before, but only the once because it wasn&#x27;t the most fun experience.  If I want to rip the hairs on my legs out by their roots, I&#x27;ll use my [[ASIN:B001EWFBLQ Braun 5180 Silk-Epil X&#x27;elle Easy Start Epilator]] to do the job:  it causes the same amount of pain, I get the same results, and I don&#x27;t have to deal with any waxy, icky residue.  I&#x27;ve also used Veet products before, in the form of their hair removal gels and cremes, with such great results that I didn&#x27;t think they could any wrong.  Well, they did wrong with this.  Boy, did they do wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the start, I encountered a problem.  As others have mentioned, though the package says it includes 24 hair removal strips, there were actually only 12 strips included.  Now, I don&#x27;t care if they can be cut in half to make 24 (though that would be rather pointless considering how short the strips are), when a product says it includes a certain number of something, then it should include that number of somethings.  I could also cut the strips in thirds, but does that give Veet the right to claim the package includes 36 hair removal strips?  I think not.  Anyway, I gave the whole process a try after my shower, so my skin was clean (and dry, I made sure of that), the hairs were slightly softened, and the follicles a bit more relaxed, all things that would make the process easier, or so I figured.  Before doing anything, I read all the instructions beforehand.  (Yes, I&#x27;m a goody two-shoes.)  I went ahead and left the heater on for over an hour.  I&#x27;d like to say I did it on purpose, to avoid the whole \\&quot;30 minutes, but maybe 10 or 20 minutes more, we don&#x27;t really know for sure\\&quot; palaver from the instruction manual, but actually I completely forgot about it (which ties in to one of my complaints about the product, which I&#x27;ll get into more fully later).  I don&#x27;t know if it was because of this long heating time or what, but when I did finally remember about it and tried the applicator, the wax rolled on smoothly.  And that&#x27;s about the only thing on or with the product which worked.  (Considering what others have experienced with the wax, apparently this is just a fluke so I&#x27;m not sure it really counts as a success.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I didn&#x27;t test the wax on a piece of paper, as recommended, mainly because I didn&#x27;t have one to hand, but I figured if the wax wasn&#x27;t going to roll smoothly after an hour+ wait, the wax wasn&#x27;t going to roll smoothly at all.  I did do as suggested, however, and turn the applicator upside-down and shake it to help the wax flow onto the roller head.  The instruction manual says that legs should be waxed from knee to ankle.  I take this to mean they should be waxed in one fell swoop.  Well, unless your leg is 8 inches long, which is the same length as the waxing strips provided, that&#x27;s completely impossible.  Personally, my lower leg is 16 inches long; perhaps I should tape the strips together in order to follow the instructions to the letter?  Yeah, wouldn&#x27;t that be silly, maybe just as silly as providing strips that are only 8 inches long.  *rolls eyes*  So I apply a little 8 inch-long strip of wax from my knee to halfway down my calf and immediately slap on a strip, again, just like the instructions tell me to.  I then rub my fingers over the strip, following the direction of hair growth (just as I did with the wax), for 15 or so seconds (the instructions don&#x27;t specify how long I&#x27;m supposed to do it, just that I do it \\&quot;repeatedly\\&quot;).  Pulling at the free edge at the bottom of the strip and pulling my skin taut, I briskly remove the strip at the instructed angle... and find that there&#x27;s more hair left on my leg than on the strip.  So, in accordance with the suggestions given in the instructions, I reapply the waxing strip (without reapplying any wax), rubbed against it in the direction of hair growth for several seconds, and removed it once again. I think I got one or two more hairs.  After repeating this a couple more times, I think it was about evenly split as to which had more hair on it, the strip or my leg.  So besides leftover hair on my leg, I now have sticky, messy wax residue.  Thankfully, the provided Perfect Finish Wipes removed all the residue from my skin.  Yay, something worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have to say this system is just poorly, poorly designed.  Firstly, the length of time you have to wait for the wax to heat up is just ridiculous (which I mentioned above I would explain more).  This is certainly not a system you can use on a whim!  To have to wait at least 30 minutes just for the wax to heat up when there are systems out there where you can microwave a pot of wax and have at least one leg, if not both legs, waxed by the time the Veet wax has readied itself is, quite frankly, preposterous. And, as we&#x27;ve all experienced here, the 30 minute wait-time is in reality more like a 60 minute wait-time, which makes the whole thing all the more preposterous.  Then there&#x27;s the applicator design:  The pink cap is practically impossible to remove.  There I am, struggling and fighting to get the darned thing off, while holding a dispenser of hot wax.  Yeah, there&#x27;s a sensible design.  *rolls eyes again*  The plug sticking out of the side of the applicator makes holding the thing awkward, and in order to hold it at the right angle to apply the wax, you&#x27;ve not only got to fight that plug, but the cord as well, which is short, thus making the whole process unbelievably difficult.  It&#x27;s as if Veet wanted something that would actively discourage people from using it more than once.  Speaking of discouraging their customers, in the instructions it says that \\&quot;It may take a few sessions with the electrical warmer and Wax Roll-On Refill to become proficient.\\&quot;  Are they talking about the user becoming proficient or the applicator becoming more proficient at dispensing the wax?  Either way, does Veet not realize that when something doesn&#x27;t work out well the first or even the second time, people aren&#x27;t very gung-ho about giving it a third or more try?  Yikes!  Really, who designed this thing?  Thanks, but I&#x27;ll stick with what I&#x27;ve used, and used successfully, to remove the hair on my legs and body all these years up &#x27;til now.ore times, I think it was about evenly split as to which had more hair on it, the strip or my leg.

    <li> This is just way too much set-up and work for waxing.  I was glad to get a chance to try it out, but I won&#x27;t be buying the refills for this unit and I will be donating to unit to Goodwill.  I am a veteran at-home waxer, and I really prefer the simplicity of the wax that you heat in the microwave, apply, then remove WITHOUT strips.  This kit just made the whole process far too complicated for me.  It also took For.Ev.Er. to heat up!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed in this system!  I followed all the instructions (both times I tried it) and it just doesn&#x27;t work well enough to justify the too high price.&lt;br /&gt;It says to let the wax warm up for a half hour and if it&#x27;s not warm enough to roll smoothly on a piece of paper let if warm a little longer until it rolls easily on the paper.  Problem is, it NEVER rolls smoothly on paper!  I let it warm up for about an hour and a half or so the first time and just decided that&#x27;s as good as it&#x27;s gonna get.&lt;br /&gt;I rolled it on about a quarter of the lower part of one leg to give it a try.  I had even let the hair grow out so it was the appropriate length according to the instructions (up to half inch!).  It was SO hard to keep myself from just shaving during showers while trying to let the hair grow.  LOL!&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so I put the wax on my leg which was a bit difficult, considering it didn&#x27;t roll smoothly.  By the way, the whole time I was doing ALL of this it was plugged in.  So, I have the wax on my leg.  I took one of the pieces of fabric and put it on, rubbing it for a couple of minutes.  I grabbed the part I had left free so I could pull, on the top of the strip, and ripped it off.  There really wasn&#x27;t very much hair on the strip!  I didn&#x27;t quite understand why they wanted you to pull IN the direction of hair growth so for the next pull I rubbed the strip again so it was adhered well and pulled from the bottom.  I had a strip FULL of hair that time!  Yay!&lt;br /&gt;I would imaging if you&#x27;ve never waxed or used an epilator it would be painful but I&#x27;ve used an epilator for a long time, just never let the hair grow that long before doing it with the epilator.&lt;br /&gt;Alright, the kit was supposed to come with 24 of the strips, it came with 12.  Directions said you could turn the strip over and use the other side so after 2 good rips I had to turn it over.  I went through 8 strips just doing one leg!  The instructions didn&#x27;t say you had to throw them away so I put them in the washer with hot water that night.  I ended up with a ball of fabric.  LMAO!  *note to self - not reuseable*&lt;br /&gt;I gave up, didn&#x27;t have enough to do the other leg anyway.  I found out just a couple of days later that the hair got broken off more than pulled out.  I won&#x27;t buy any replacement strips and the kit is trash!</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t wax my legs or bikini area but decided to give the Veet Easy Wax Roll On a try. The wax comes in a neat little cartridge. It takes about 10-15 minutes to heat up. It rolls on pretty smoothly. There were gaps so I had to roll on a second time in the same spot. The hair came off without a hitch. Overall a good product. I&#x27;ll most likely use it for small waxing jobs and save the rest for the professionals.</li>
    <li> It took the wax over twice as long to heat up as the directions say. I had a hard time getting it to roll nicely. I also had didn&#x27;t get the results I was hoping for. It took about half of the hair on my legs and I had to go over some spots twice.</li>
    <li> After using this a few times I must say that I am highly disappointed. It never gave me the results I was hoping to achieve and I know I followed the directions thoroughly. It takes at least 30minutes to heat up and you must leave it plugged in while using it so the wax can stay hot. That&#x27;s about the only good thing about this is that no batteries are required. It comes with the waxing strips which you must cut into smaller strips for more use and the finishing wipes for after use which by the way worked pretty well. The wax roller did not glide smooth and no hair was hardly took off. I will just stick to razors or clippers.</li>
    <li> It is easy. I like that. It is minimal mess too. However, waxing is waxing and it still hurts! It did leave (what I could wax) nice and soft though!</li>
    <li> I received this Veet Easy Wax system for free from Influenster.com. I usually use sugaring for hair removable. Veet Easy Wax was pretty fast to use. The instructions say leave it plugged in for 30 minutes. I actually didn&#x27;t mind that. I just found something to do while I waited. I ended up forgetting about it so it was plugged in for about 45 or 50 minutes. Which seems like a perfect time. Stayed hot enough to wax both legs. I would have had to replug it in to do other areas though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The waxing went pretty quick and was less messy than sugaring. I went through about 8 strips total for both legs. The hair was about 1/8th of an inch long. It didn&#x27;t get everything but I assume that&#x27;s because the hair was so short. Next time I&#x27;ll try to let it go for a bit longer and see if it works better. You only get 24 strips but I don&#x27;t mind. I prefer to use cut strips of linen cloth anyway. Cheaper and washable. Also the kit only came with 4 finishing wipes. Again, personally not a big deal for me as I like to use coconut oil after waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to roll the wax over the same area a few times to build it up. About 4 rolls over each area seems to do the trick. Any less wax and it doesn&#x27;t remove much hair. I also ran the waxer a few times over some folded paper towels \\&quot;to get it going\\&quot; first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the instructions. I skimmed them for the heating time and then tossed them. Its like any other waxing system. Heat it, apply in narrow long strips (about 6 inches or so), and rip it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I liked it for its quick convenience. Refills and strips aren&#x27;t too badly priced. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use it regularly though. I like to wax everything so I would run through strips and refills like crazy. Sugaring is a bit more budget friendly for how much I like to wax. A bag of sugar for a couple bucks and you have wax all summer! I&#x27;ll still use it when I don&#x27;t feel like preparing a sugar wax or just in a hurry and need touch ups.h ups.</li>
    <li> i recieved this product for review from influenster.com. i&#x27;ve never waxed before so this was a new thing for me to try. i was pleased with the included materials but in the end i was very displeased with the product its self. the instructions were very easy to follow and i had no trouble setting up the product or applying it. it went on easy enough but when i pulled the strips off to remove hair i found that a lot of hair was left on my legs. since the product states not to wax over an area you have already waxed, i was left with a very uneven hair removal and was forced to go over my legs with a razor after i was finished to remove what the wax left behind. all in all, i am at least glad i didn&#x27;t waste money on this product, because i would be taking it back to the store if this was a purchase instead of a review copy.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this. I have used SO MANY hair removal products and this is my favorite by far. My legs are long and thick and it takes ages to shave or epilate them, but with this thing it was easy and fast. I let it heat for like 40 minutes and it was perfect, no mess, no pain, it took me like 20 minutes to do both legs. I also used it for my armpits, and then I noticed I didn&#x27;t even used that much wax. Definitely worth the price! I&#x27;ll be using the same cartridge for like 8 times, I can tell. It&#x27;s true that it has few strips, but still you can reuse them (I only used 5), and that&#x27;s like the easiest thing to get in a pharmacy. LOVED IT</li>
    <li> I took Veet at their word when they named this &amp;quot;Easy Wax Roll On.&amp;quot;  I pictured something that heated quickly, rolled on easily, and peeled off the hair effectively.  This product only does one of those well: rolling on easily.  Heating took forever and when I was able to finally use it, it did roll on easily, but it only took off less than half the hair.  I&#x27;ve had laser hair removal on my legs so there isn&#x27;t a lot left there, but this product managed to miss most of it.  I had to re-apply it about three times to get everything, and even then I had to do extensive recognizance with a tweezer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lot of other reviewers rated it based on the quality of the directions (which are truly bad) and the length of the electrical cord (which is ridiculously short), but my review is based simply on it&#x27;s effectiveness at removing hair - and it gets a big &amp;quot;meh&amp;quot; for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - It always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful. If you&#x27;d also like to ask a question or leave a comment I usually respond the same day, so if you have a question or comment (even if it&#x27;s just to say, Hi!&amp;quot;) feel free to post it below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Claire</li>
    <li> I received this product free through Influenster to try and review and boy, I was not let down!  I have used all manner of at home waxes, microwaveable, cold wax, wax strips and even the traditional electrical pot but none of those have the mess free ease of this!  The kit has everything you need to wax at home including a wonderful hand held electrical warmer that uses a disposable wax insert.  No testing the wax temperature and being burnt or using a messy stick and getting your hands and counter messy, just plug it in, let it warm to a perfect temperature and wax away!  When I was done waxing my lower legs (from the knee down)  I had enough wax to do at least another session of my lower legs too!  Once your done waxing you can use one of the included cleaning wipes to soothe your skin and clean up any leftover wax.  The wipes work very well and smell refreshingly amazing.  The disposable inserts come in 3 different options one with the larger roller for legs and body, one with a smaller roller for bikini and underarms and even a wax insert for sensitive skin!  So when you have used up the wax insert that came with your kit just buy one of the 3 refill kits and your set.  It seems that Veet has thought of everything with this kit!</li>
    <li> Takes a lot of time for the wax to heat up(45mins), but it does a pretty neat job. Wax strips that come along with the product is of great quality. Love it.</li>
    <li> I like it but now I&#x27;m caught to buy only Veet waxes; I would like to try new waxes.&lt;br /&gt;The machine is small so is hard to find a different wax that fixes on it.</li>
    <li> Did what it needed to do.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected  Good service</li>
    <li> Ok, so i know i have coarse hair and i know it can be stubborn, but i tried this and even had my roommate try it on me as well. When first attempted i followed instructions and turned out the wax was not warm enough. When i rolled it on it actually hurt and i realized it wasnt warm enough, so i plugged it back and let it stand and warm for another fifteen minutes after the initial thirty. Once i let it warm up it rolled on a little easier and when i pressed strip down to remove thats when i wasnt too happy. There was some smooth parts and then there was some prickly parts. As if it did not pull all my hair up. I cant stand that. So my roommate gave it a shot on my other leg. Same exact results. So i do not know if it was just me or the strips. However all the hair was not removed when i attempted this. I did spots with more wax than others and results were the same. So just be wary when using this. Hair may not be removed as advertised. Other than that, the hair and spots that was removed was left feeling very smooth and the cleaning wipes removed wax and the shower removed whatever was leftover. Legs felt very soft, smooth, and no itching or irritation. Besides the leftover hair that i ended up having to shave the next day.</li>
    <li> Let me start by stating that I have been self-waxing for over three years. I know what I&#x27;m doing with this stuff. I usually use Surgi-Wax for Bikini, Body and Legs, but thought I&#x27;ve give this a go. The heated applicator had me intrigued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I intensely dislike this product! The applicator takes F O R E V E R  to heat up. I don&#x27;t have 45 minutes to wait for my wax to be ready! The strips are hard to use and when you DO get them off, they don&#x27;t take off nearly enough hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use an electric candle warmer for my Surgi-Wax, so trips back and forth to the microwave and not an issue for me. This is one of those things that seems like such a great idea in theory, but in practice it just isn&#x27;t...well...practical!</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the wax after 30 minutes with no luck. I followed instructions and kept trying it and trying it and trying it, all to no avail. I then thought that maybe my hair was too long and I needed to trim it really small for the wax to take hold. That approach didn&#x27;t work either. Finally, after waiting for several hours and trying different things, I gave up and shaved with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then tried again in several days and found out that the results were the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed that I can&#x27;t get rid of hair at home the way I&#x27;d like with this wax on roll on kit. I was quite excited for it considering that the first time I tried hair removing application, I found myself leaning towards Veet instead of Nair because Veet led to smoother legs with longer time in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the Veet Easy Wax Roll On doesn&#x27;t deliver in the way Veet gel did.</li>
    <li> First of all, I never thought I&#x27;d say traditional waxing was easier.  It is.  And cheaper.  And less annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever wax formulation they use varies between useless and frustrating.  It doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as the messier kits.  Also, it took mine over an hour to heat up, which sort of kills the convenience, you know?  It&#x27;s really not worth the price, especially when you consider that you can get a salon-ish type kit at a beauty supply store (or anywhere online) for  more that is far less frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice idea - haphazard execution.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just as great as going and getting a professional wax. Yea it takes a long time to heat up but that&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s going from a solid to a liquid. I would definitely recommend this to any of my friends. ðŸ˜¸ This will be saving me money in the long run!</li>
    <li> When I saw this product I thought it be very convenient since it is a roll on so no mess and easier to apply. Although, it does make a huge mistake it does an awful job for waxing. Several attempts to wax hair off my legs was very unimpressive. After several attempts I&#x27;m still with unwanted hair and out of waxing strips. Just plain disappointing performance from the kit. You&#x27;d be better off with a more traditional style waxing kit.</li>
    <li> I received Veet Easy Wax to product test recently. All I can really say is that I am glad I didn&#x27;t purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Electric Warming Applicator - This may be a \\&quot;pro\\&quot; in the sense of convenience, however it took much longer to heat up than the instructions suggested. 3 times as long to be exact. Not a big deal if you have time on your hands to wait around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Messy - Because of the lack of specific instructions, this is a VERY messy product. It didn&#x27;t explain how thick to apply wax or how long to leave strip on before removal. Because of this, I had lots of leftover wax on my skin, which was near impossible to remove all it due to lack of enough afterwax packets. Also, it very rarely removed hair to be worth the pain and mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this product&#x27;s hype was just too good to be true. It let me down.I was looking forward to trying it when I initially discovered it on here before testing. If I had to recommend another Veet product to use instead, I would definitely go for the Cold Wax Strips. Much better at removing hair and not nearly as messy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never ever waxed before, but got this from Influenster free to test out. I have to say, I was a little wary. The first time I tried it, my hair wasn&#x27;t long enough and it was somewhat of a disaster. It hurt, none of the hairs came off... awful. I waited a few more days and it was a HUGE difference. Not nearly as painful, my legs were smooth at the end of it and days later I haven&#x27;t had to shave to touch up. I&#x27;m in love! It was super easy for me to use, having never waxed, and really convenient. My only complaint is that they didn&#x27;t include enough of the soothing wipes. I went through a lot my first time since I just made a gunky mess. I&#x27;ll have to see if I can find some separately, but aside from that I really recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I received the Veet Easy Wax System complimentary from Influenster for testing and review...I used it 2 weeks ago...and today, I still have smooth legs! This was so easy to use...plug it in, wait 30 minutes, roll it on and wax it off. And the wipes that come with it to remove the residue are amazing! I would recommend this product to every girl!</li>
