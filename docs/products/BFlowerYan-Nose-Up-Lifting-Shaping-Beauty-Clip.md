### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Everybody should have a perfect nose...</li>
      <li>So happy!</li>
      <li>works great!</li>
      <li>Works wonderfully!</li>
      <li>What a great nose job alternative!</li>
      <li>but still in a very good shape...</li>
      <li>I recommend to anyone post rhino great product</li>
      <li>great shipping though.</li>
      <li>its great...</li>
      <li>lol I wear it for 30 minutes</li>
      <li>good product not what I expect it.</li>
      <li>I want to give it a good try before writing a review</li>
      <li>If you are patient then this is a good product.</li>
      <li>Good product, good quality, thank you</li>
      <li>and he is right lol!!</li>
      <li>But the product surely did its thing!  </li>
      <li>great price and free shipping for me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s as described, but not used often, so don&#x27;t know how effective it is.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting, to be completely honest.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s kind of irritating...but</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s taken a month to see any kind of change, but that could be because I&#x27;ve been staring a lot at my nose and wondering if the clip is working.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really make your nose pointed like Caucasians, lol!</li>
      <li>will update if it really is effective.</li>
      <li>I find makeup contouring to be a more effective way of slimming and shaping my nose.</li>
      <li>this is a very cheap product with some dedication from your part</li>
      <li>It looks like a dog chewed on it, as well as its covered in some kind of fine brown dust.</li>
      <li>so anyone writing that they are not seeing results after a week of wearing it for like 5 minutes is not an accurate review!</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I would buy more items from the seller again.</li>
      <li>You have to make sure you breathe through your mouth while using it :)</li>
      <li>I love this product .</li>
      <li>I think better results might be had if one can wear it overnight or many times throughout the day, just based on my research.</li>
      <li>the orginal one is Nose Magic  </li>
      <li>YOU HAVE TO WEAR THIS FOR MORE THAN 15 MINUTES A DAY.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s better than taping.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>but many weeks have passed now</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>but I love it</li>
      <li>I figure one needs to wear this for more than 15 minutes a day.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use while at home and comfortable.</li>
      <li>this is actually a pretty good item.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of fun to pretend, though.</li>
      <li>The clip leaves marks on the sides of my nose and kind of stings after the first 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>I wont fit my nose and there is no difference after a month.</li>
      <li>I followed directions precisely for over 6 weeks, but did not notice any difference in the shape of my nose.  </li>
      <li>It looks a tad bit slimmer, but I honestly think that that&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve been scrutinizing and inspecting it so much.</li>
      <li>it does hurt lol after about ten to fifteen minutes</li>
      <li>Thankfully it was so cheap</li>
      <li>I heard about this on YouTube and decided to try it out since it was so cheap.</li>
      <li>So, no, I would not recommend this product to anyone even if it is really cheap.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to have the nose up until I used it.</li>
      <li>I do not have a huge nose and just wanted some mild narrowing of the tip.  </li>
      <li>It just makes your nose hurt and look bright red.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m damn sure it&#x27;s really doing it.</li>
      <li>Good enough for me!</li>
      <li>It is true to description though.</li>
      <li>Amazingly cheap and useful...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m aiming at cartilage, and it&#x27;s actually not bad</li>
      <li>They all claim that since cartilage is made mostly of water, then it can easily be altered with constant pressure.</li>
      <li>I suspect the amount of success</li>
      <li>The most important thing to understand before expecting this to work is that you can only reshape the part of your nose that is made of cartilage.</li>
      <li>It is inexpensive and good for people who are not interested in surgery.  </li>
      <li>I paid a dollar something to have my kid laugh at me because I look and talk funny.</li>
      <li>its delivered super fast.</li>
      <li>only downside is the actual quality of the clip isn&#x27;t that great</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s only 4.99 better than buying nose right and nose huggie.</li>
      <li>nose hasn&#x27;t changed since the first review I wrote a month ago.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It makes my nose appear slimmer at first</li>
      <li>but you need consistent use.  </li>
      <li>If only a nose-job was this cheap!</li>
      <li>There are a ton of angles you can use, just find one that will hold and make sure that your nostrils look the same on both sides.</li>
      <li>I feel so pretty</li>
      <li>I am from Germany and before I was able to buy this item I had to get a credit card, wich is not really my likely thing.  </li>
      <li>You only need to use it 15 mins twice a day, anything more than 15 mins will cause pain.  </li>
      <li>use it consistently.</li>
      <li>I can defiantly say that my nose looks smaller and more sculpted.</li>
      <li>this was most likely created for, though.</li>
      <li>not much the tip of my nose is kind of slimmer.</li>
      <li>So I searched all around the internet for a cheap (definitely non-surgical because it is really risky) way to shorten my nose</li>
      <li>and I use it but who knows if it really works.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I only got it for how cheap it was</li>
      <li>What do you have to really lose?</li>
      <li>I use it for longer than 15 mins now because I used it so much that my pain threshold has changed.  </li>
      <li>can&#x27;t really be working?</li>
      <li>wear it while I am getting ready</li>
      <li>It really helped my nose</li>
      <li>couldn&#x27;t figure out what the outward pointy part was for and it was really bothering me not knowing..</li>
      <li>Really like the nose huggie.</li>
      <li>To those who beg to differ and swear this clips works: please provide some real before and after pictures.</li>
      <li>and you need to take before and after pics to really see the difference.</li>
      <li>but it really did work.</li>
      <li>It is not a miracle tool, but I could really feel that it helps.</li>
      <li>It worked really well and improved my nose shape (wore it for about 90 minutes a day).  </li>
      <li>Hopefully other buyers had better luck</li>
      <li>other than that, I like it :)</li>
      <li>Maybe their other nose contraptions work better or maybe this one just didn&#x27;t work for me who knows.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think fatty tissue is made of mostly water, but it is soft like cartilage (e.g., how women stuff their fat butts in tight jeans and they look good &#x27;til the jeans come off).</li>
      <li>OK, so I got this about a week ago and at first I did not know where to put it on my nose , but then after trying it a few ways I know just where I want to put it</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it could work. Very uncomfortable to use it.</li>
    <li> I dont iike it but i am keeping it just in case..........</li>
    <li> Good product, good quality, thank you</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully! Love it.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed in this product. I understand you get what you pay for but when I got this in the mail the white tip was dirty and it was starting to rip apart. Hopefully other buyers had better luck then I did.</li>
    <li> Some people tape the nose after several months following a rhino I used this clip around 5 -6 months after my rhino and it&#x27;s better than taping. I use it every morning for 15-20 min and it brings down my swelling significantly. I  just bought my second clip as i have worn down my old one from several months of use. I recommend to anyone post rhino great product only downside is the actual quality of the clip isn&#x27;t that great but it gets the job done</li>
    <li> Left a blister on my nose</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s only 4.99 better than buying nose right and nose huggie. they&#x27;re just the same product. great shipping though. didn&#x27;t expect it to arrive earlier. tried it for 1week now and it leaves a dark red mark on my nose. hope it goes away. and you need to take before and after pics to really see the difference. will update if it really is effective. and you have to use a toner (alcohol or vinegar) so that it won&#x27;t fall off.</li>
    <li> its not strong enough</li>
    <li> It is not a miracle tool, but I could really feel that it helps.</li>
    <li> i have a fat nose like i guess you can say a lot of fat on the mid to bottom on my nose in which i hate..so basically i put it on on the tip leave for about 15 minutes..for me i see a difference already my nose dont look so fat anymore like the nostril area. I would say hey give it a try, its cheap and well worth it if your gonna keep it up everyday for at least a month. Of course for the first money if your not using it everyday then your not gonna know if its going to work. but i think it has worked for me and people notice so its great...</li>
    <li> I would like to start off by saying that I ordered the nose up clip and the bridge straightening clip (both from HDE) and they came in the same package a day or 2 before the given estimated time of arrival. (I had to pay for shipping separately, which was annoying, but hey, the whole order was only 8 dollars. so no biggy)     YOU HAVE TO WEAR THIS FOR MORE THAN 15 MINUTES A DAY. IF YOU ONLY WHERE IT FOR 15 MINUTES A DAY, YOU ARE JUST KIDDING YOURSELF BECAUSE IT WILL EITHER NOT WORK OR WORK SO SLOWLY, YOU&#x27;LL BE 900 BEFORE YOU SEE RESULTS. In the last day and a half, I&#x27;ve been wearing mine for HOURS at a time (on and off) and I also napped in it. In the last 30 hours, there has definitely been a noticeable change.       There are a ton of angles you can use, just find one that will hold and make sure that your nostrils look the same on both sides. It might slide off because of sweat or something. It might be loosening after extended wear. ( o well it was $4) Like I said, I wear it for hours. It might be uncomfortable or even hurt at first, but hang in there, eventually you&#x27;ll get used to it and little red marks on your nose go away after a few minutes. If you need to, put some toilet paper on the little buds to soften the impact. I&#x27;ll probably be done with using it in less than a week at this rate.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for roughly a month and you would like to see my before and after pic. Amazingly cheap and useful...it arrived a little late though but still in a very good shape...Everybody should have a perfect nose...hihihi</li>
    <li> Seems to make my nose slimer temporary</li>
    <li> Does not work at all.</li>
    <li> Suprisly this helps narrow my nose down</li>
    <li> If you have oily skin, it is hard to keep this in place. First time I tried to use it, it immediately flew right back off! After washing and astringing my face, I got it to stay on for about 10 minutes, but after that the oil levels began to return and I had to hold it down with my hand. Eventually I figured out I could put a square of kleenex as a barrier between my skin and the shaper, and that seemed to work at absorbing enough of the oil that the device didn&#x27;t fall off. I figure one needs to wear this for more than 15 minutes a day. I can stand about 40-45 minutes before it&#x27;s too painful. I think better results might be had if one can wear it overnight or many times throughout the day, just based on my research. I suspect the amount of success you&#x27;ll have also depends whether it&#x27;s the boney part or the cartilage part that you hope to reshape -- I&#x27;m still not sure which is more likely to succeed. I&#x27;m aiming at cartilage, and it&#x27;s actually not bad but it does seem to go back after a while. It does leave a little bruising/red mark you might have to cover with makeup, though.  Also after a few days it seemed to be causing nerve damage that was making my nose and forehead feel like they were sunburnt all the time (no redness, just the same kind of pain/discomfort as a sunburn.) Due to this, I&#x27;m feeling disinclined to keep using the item as I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth risking constant pain on something that is not even sure to succeed.</li>
    <li> It really helped my nose but it took forever to come in the mail and it broke within a month and a half. The material sucks but it helped my nose so I ordered it again. If you cant find another nose shaper or if desperate, than I suggest you buy more than one because one won&#x27;t last</li>
    <li> This is annoying because it wont even stay on. I&#x27;d have to hold it in place. So, no, I would not recommend this product to anyone even if it is really cheap. Maybe their other nose contraptions work better or maybe this one just didn&#x27;t work for me who knows.</li>
    <li> OK, so I got this about a week ago and at first I did not know where to put it on my nose , but then after trying it a few ways I know just where I want to put it and WOW guess who I look a lot like know ASHLEY GREENE I feel so pretty my 18th birthday is coming up know and I can&#x27;t wait to see what I will look like by then. What a great nose job alternative! So happy!</li>
    <li> I am still using it, I bought it January and I am not seeing any changes at this moment, hopefully that changes</li>
    <li> It didnt work as i expected it . I see no difference . There were no changes . Not happy with it .</li>
    <li> I found it to be an ok product, especially for the low price.  I do not have a huge nose and just wanted some mild narrowing of the tip.  It has to be used consistently though, and you will see minor changes, thanks!</li>
    <li> This product does nothing to &amp;#34;Lift&amp;#34; the nose, its pretty much a clip to hold your nose closed. I paid a dollar something to have my kid laugh at me because I look and talk funny.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use while at home and comfortable. works well and you can be doing other things at the same time.</li>
    <li> For the price.....i thought i would just purchase this and try it out as I have heard about it on social media....but I have yet to receive this item..it never arrived!</li>
    <li> k u wont see a plastic surgery results from this but ull def see improvements., i had plastic surgery for my nose few yrs baq and with time i felt my nose is starting to drop down a lil this def helped lift my nose and make it smaller., and another result i loved and noticed was that my nose was lil crocked to the side and it helped make it less noticeable., i saw clear results after two weeks but many weeks have passed now and i still use it., i put it in diff ways and i can breath from my mouth if the way blocked my breathing.. i keep it from 30-60 min</li>
    <li> this is actually a pretty good item. but I have to wear it for an hour a day for maybe 2 weeks to see a big difference. and it&#x27;s kind of irritating...but other than that, I like it :)</li>
    <li> After watching several YouTube videos on the merits of this product, I decided to give it a try.  I followed directions precisely for over 6 weeks, but did not notice any difference in the shape of my nose.  It is kind of painful to wear too.  I find makeup contouring to be a more effective way of slimming and shaping my nose.</li>
    <li> good product not what I expect it.</li>
    <li> Shipping was definitely faster than I expected. Only been using it for a bit &amp; have seen some slight results but will continue to use it longer.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my nose but does give me a new place to dangle my mp3 player.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this clip on my wide nose for a month for about 20 minutes a day, every day. I place it at the tip of my nose where it&#x27;s the widest, right past the bone where the cartilage begins. The clip leaves marks on the sides of my nose and kind of stings after the first 10 minutes. Other than the red marks that the rubber pegs leave behind, my nose looks awesome as soon as I remove the clip. My nose widens again within an hour of removing the clip, but at least the redness goes away. It&#x27;s taken a month to see any kind of change, but that could be because I&#x27;ve been staring a lot at my nose and wondering if the clip is working. I would guesstimate about an 8% slimming of my nose after a month&#x27;s use. I will continue using it and hope to see a definite change after month two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update: Month Two**&lt;br /&gt;My nose hasn&#x27;t changed since the first review I wrote a month ago. It looks a tad bit slimmer, but I honestly think that that&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve been scrutinizing and inspecting it so much. I measured my nostrils, and they&#x27;re the same width as before I started using the clip. I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that this product serves as a placebo rather than a money-saving miracle. I&#x27;ve read about the concept behind it and other nose-altering clips (Nose Huggie, Nose Right, etc.). They all claim that since cartilage is made mostly of water, then it can easily be altered with constant pressure. If this is the case, then a person who sits in a chair for hours at a time every day would have a flat rear end and thighs as long as they continue the same sitting habits. I don&#x27;t think fatty tissue is made of mostly water, but it is soft like cartilage (e.g., how women stuff their fat butts in tight jeans and they look good &#x27;til the jeans come off). The concept about the pliability and the pressure is the same so what gives?? To those who beg to differ and swear this clips works: please provide some real before and after pictures. In conclusion, I think I will stick to using makeup to make my nose look slimmer until I can afford a $10k rhinoplasty.ng makeup to make my nose look slimmer until I can afford a $10k rhinoplasty.</li>
    <li> This product hurts my nose. I think it may work short term, but not long term. It&#x27;s kind of fun to pretend, though. If only a nose-job was this cheap!</li>
    <li> okay so I have been wearing this every night after I take off my makeup, my husband jokes about how I look with it lol I wear it for 30 minutes and I have been using this for a bout a week maybe a little longer not sure anyways I have noticed some change not much the tip of my nose is kind of slimmer. This is a product that requires time! so anyone writing that they are not seeing results after a week of wearing it for like 5 minutes is not an accurate review! you have to wear it for about 30 minutes each day for a long period of time I feel from seeing my result so far that it will be another two to three weeks before I see major results. it does hurt lol after about ten to fifteen minutes i complained about the pain ones to my husband and he said &amp;#34;beats the pain of a nose surgery&#x27; and he is right lol!! this is a very cheap product with some dedication from your part could give you the results you are seeking. Over all i do like it and its so inexpensive that i didn&#x27;t mind buying and trying this out.</li>
    <li> Try it out. It seems to help with bumpy cartilage.</li>
    <li> i think this product is the second version....the orginal one is Nose Magic  i had bought this product about a month ago than i came across this web site [...]  and there are decription and picture to tell about the fake and the orginal one  and i think i just order the fake one   about my result i see no difference after a month so i stop using it..</li>
    <li> I just received this today - so I can&#x27;t even comment on its effectiveness. I am disgusted at what I received. It looks like a dog chewed on it, as well as its covered in some kind of fine brown dust. I don&#x27;t even want this anywhere near my face. Thankfully it was so cheap I don&#x27;t have to bother returning it. That&#x27;s just gross!!</li>
    <li> If you want immediate results you should get rhinoplasty. If you are patient then this is a good product. You only need to use it 15 mins twice a day, anything more than 15 mins will cause pain.  The most important thing to understand before expecting this to work is that you can only reshape the part of your nose that is made of cartilage. You CAN NOT reshape bone without surgery.  I have noticed a difference in the shape of my nose. I use it for longer than 15 mins now because I used it so much that my pain threshold has changed.  It is inexpensive and good for people who are not interested in surgery.  :)</li>
    <li> Item was broken when received</li>
    <li> One of my favorites items for before makeup</li>
    <li> I heard about this on YouTube and decided to try it out since it was so cheap. The thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t stay on my nose, it slips and falls off. Not only that it really hurts too.</li>
    <li> it does work. use it consistently.</li>
    <li> Works for shaping your nose! I love this product .</li>
    <li> it leaves a mark on my skin for like an hour after i use it for 10-12 mins. I feel like i need to ice my nose afterward bc it actually swells it a bit but IT FREAKING WORKS. i didn&#x27;t say anything about it and my friends have been commenting on my nose looking smaller.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t figure out what the outward pointy part was for and it was really bothering me not knowing.. i accidentally started chewing on a point end until it broke off and turns out it just keeps the front part in place.. great price and free shipping for me. its delivered super fast. i def recommend trying it</li>
    <li> (NOTE: I also posted this review on the same article on amazon)  Since both my parents have a long nose with a dorsal hump there was no other possible case than me having one, too.  So I searched all around the internet for a cheap (definitely non-surgical because it is really risky) way to shorten my nose and so I found products like Nose Up, Nose Right, Nose Huggies and such (do not worry, they are all the same). I decided this one, because it&#x27;s the cheapest and it is on amazon.  It worked really well and improved my nose shape (wore it for about 90 minutes a day).  But there is one thing there is to complain about:  I am from Germany and before I was able to buy this item I had to get a credit card, wich is not really my likely thing.  So please, as an advice for you, put this product on the german amazon website, without this annoying credit card stuff.  But the product surely did its thing!  Thank you for that.</li>
    <li> this item is truly awful. Even the packaging shows that it is a gag - woman driving the car and not smelling fumes, words about avoiding stink. It&#x27;s a very painful plastic clothespin.&lt;br /&gt;My biggest disappointment is not the that item is so bad, but that Amazon sells it.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is my main retailer for EVERYTHING, I spend thousands of dollars per year on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;This item would be on the low end at a dollar store.&lt;br /&gt;It is shameful that it is being sold on the Amazon site.</li>
    <li> This product definitely narrowed out the tip of my nose over the course of about 3 weeks. You do need to leave it on for longer than 15 minutes at a time, though, or at least in 15 minute increments but multiple times a day. I use mine for about an hour or two a day but do not use it daily.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. It just makes your nose hurt and look bright red. I only got it for how cheap it was so i decided to give a go. Now it just sits in a drawer.</li>
    <li> I lost it after a week but I saw some improvements!</li>
    <li> This thing is seriously so stupid but I love it and I use it but who knows if it really works.&lt;br /&gt;I wear it while I am getting ready and before I do my make I take it off.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my nose appear slimmer at first but.. I think it&#x27;s an illusion!&lt;br /&gt;This can&#x27;t really be working?</li>
    <li> Did not work at all. My bridge is probably a lot wider than the noses this was most likely created for, though. Either way, I saw no difference and was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I want to give it a good try before writing a review but I couldn&#x27;t wear it for more than 15 mins because it would hurt so bad</li>
    <li> It took almost a month to come,but so far I do like the product. I&#x27;m not sure if it works, but I hope it works a little.</li>
    <li> I got the Nose Up a little over 2 weeks ago. I have had rhinoplasty a few years back but was still unhappy with the results. I&#x27;m not sure what this thing is doing exactly but it&#x27;s working! The small bump I had on the right side of my nose is disappearing. Maybe it&#x27;s reshaping the cartilage. But I&#x27;m damn sure it&#x27;s really doing it. My boyfriend even noticed. Also the tip of my nose isnt as prevailant as before. Everything as a whole looks smaller and I could NOT be happier with the result! Try it yourself..It&#x27;s under 2 bucks. What do you have to really lose?</li>
    <li> Ehh still seeing if works but no results yet it&#x27;s been a week</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as described, but not used often, so don&#x27;t know how effective it is.</li>
    <li> Wont even clip on my nose. Way too small! Waste of money.</li>
    <li> It works a little bit. My nose did shrink for a little while, but if you stop using it, your nose will go back to it&#x27;s natural shape. But it does work if you frequently use it. Good enough for me!</li>
    <li> Weird. It doesn&#x27;t do as said but that&#x27;s also because I hardly ever used it. When u use it you will know that it might even deform the nasal bridge</li>
    <li> This was just a waste of my time. I used it for 30 mins a day. It didn&#x27;t change my nose at all. I also didn&#x27;t like that when i put it on it made my nose sag down so I just stopped using it and threw it away. Id rather have my nose then a longer one. Just my opinion. I hope it works for yall.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to have the nose up until I used it. I wont fit my nose and there is no difference after a month.</li>
    <li> It hurts to wear, and it&#x27;s really unnecessary, really. I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting, to be completely honest.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to, just leaves an indentation from the sponges . For 1$ can&#x27;t complain !</li>
    <li> Really like the nose huggie. Carli Bybel recommended it.</li>
    <li> I love it. But can&#x27;t use while sleeping. It appears to be reshaping my nose.</li>
    <li> Carli Bybel brought me here, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using it. It is true to description though.</li>
    <li> Knowing this isn&#x27;t the original product I wasn&#x27;t expecting mucb, especially at such a low price. This product actually hurt my nose.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really make your nose pointed like Caucasians, lol! Darn Japanese inventors who feed into people&#x27;s fantasies for those who  want a pointed nose.&lt;br /&gt;Face it, cartilage will not shape itself with this painful pitching device. This product left my nose bruised after leaving it for the appointment time. It also left my nose sore and it didn&#x27;t make my nose sharper. The product is a total myth.</li>
    <li> I purchased a nose up (or nose huggie) on ebay about a year ago. I can defiantly say that my nose looks smaller and more sculpted.Looking through my pictures from the past I noticed my nose was really wide and my face is small so therefore it looked really BIG. When I purchased this clip I thought to myself no this probably isn&#x27;t going to work, only expensive surgery but it really did work. So yeah I recommend.</li>
    <li> the spring broke because of bad quality</li>
    <li> this thing is not comfortable i barley wore it and in two days it broke not worth it at all</li>
    <li> works great! I use this every time I do my makeup.</li>
    <li> Helps makes my nose thinner but you need consistent use.  You have to make sure you breathe through your mouth while using it :)</li>
    <li> Not sure if this product truly works or if I want it to work.  But I do know that this product hurts so its all up to you to try it and see if this truly works for you. But you get what you pay for the seller was on time with shipment it was not late came with instructions. I would buy more items from the seller again.</li>
