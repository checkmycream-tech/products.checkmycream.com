<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product weighed my hair down and went on very wet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just not sure this really makes a difference.  I suppose if I used a big round brush to blow dry my hair, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair.  After a week, I&#x27;m halfway through the bottle.  Just not enough product, given the price, for someone with hair like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the flip side, the product itself is great.  My hair has volume all day.  The smell is clean and subtle.  It doesn&#x27;t make the hair crunchy or stiff.  I don&#x27;t get the full 48 hours as advertised, but I wash my hair every day, so the point is moot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For someone with finer, shorter hair, I can see this being an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and after being sick and losing alot (which is finally growing back thank goodness) my hair was horribly thin - this product has really helped alot to add volume.  I definitely notice a difference when I don&#x27;t use it.  Doesn&#x27;t take a lot so the bottle seems to last a good amount of time.</li>
    <li> exactly as promised - wish it was a bit less expensive</li>
    <li> This product works quite well.</li>
    <li> Old , thinning,......get it........</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and use a few sprays just on the top before blow drying. I really like the way this seems to give my top section volume.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair feeling like straw.  Does add volume but hair feels awful.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love thisvolumizing spray . I purchased this along with the shampoo &amp; conditioner from QVC , I didn&#x27;t know amazon had items like this , stupid me. The shampoo &amp; conditioner , I gave to my daughter in law, it just dried my hair out . But this spray gives my hair  amazing results. My hair is EXTREMELY,  EXTREMELY FINE AND VERY THIN. After I wash and condition my hair using AUSSIE brand, I flip my head upside down spraying this all through my hair, then brushing  it through my hair , I then put my hair up in a towel , put on my face , then I use a curling brush to style my hair . I can not believe how great my hair looks .  This volumizing spray smells good as well . I will be ordering this from amazon from now on. The shampoo &amp; conditioner have great smell to, but they just weren&#x27;t successful for me . My hair is shoulder length and I use about 8 pumps through my hair, and the slight curves in the spray bottle makes it easy to hold even with wet hands. I have been trying different volumizers for years ,shampoos, creams, mousses, everything, but this really works. THANKS FOR READING, BYE.😄</li>
    <li> nice fragrance, great soft body, good hold with some volume</li>
    <li> did not like the smell</li>
    <li> This product sadly did not live up to its write up of lasting up to 48 hours. I would say it only provided very little boost for 4 hours. Definitely not something I would buy again to use on my fine hair.</li>
    <li> The only thing I liked about this product, is the smell.  Other than that, sorry to say but it&#x27;s just junk! It is WAAAY overpriced for something that doesn&#x27;t even do it&#x27;s job.  &amp;#34;48-hour sustainable volume&amp;#34;??? More like 0-second unstainable volume.  It does absolutely nothing to volumize your hair.  I have other products that are not even half the price and outperforms this.  It&#x27;s only 4.2 oz, but I bet even if I sprayed the whole bottle in my hair it would still be lifeless.  The famous celebrities that advertise for this got me......but now I know the truth.</li>
    <li> Started out good but then it started acting like liquid glue.  You won&#x27;t be able to comb through to the ends.</li>
    <li> This works great with any shampoo.  I love that I can go 2 days with the feeling of thicker hair.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that works for me! I spray it at the roots, rub it in with fingertips and blow dry my hair upside down and am given ample amounts of volume! It dies down a little throughout the day but I still have considerably more volume than I would if I blow dry hair upside down without this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling nasty and full of product. I highly recommend this stuff. Bamboo brand has yet to disappoint me!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this from the stylist prior to this purchase.  I love it.  It is great for fine straight hair.  It provides volume on my hair which I couldn&#x27;t achieve with other products.  Easy to use - much easier than mousse which can be difficult to apply evenly.  Spray at the roots with hair wet and then blow dry.  Do not need to apply until you wash your hair again.  Washes out easily with no residue left in hair or scalp. If I work out at the gym, I can blow dry it back out and it will put volume back easily.  Smells good - not overpowering.</li>
    <li> This is truly the first product I have ever used successfully on my short, fine hair.  It also allows for restyling and looks pretty good on day two - something I have never been able to do in the past.</li>
    <li> Wow! Works great! Gives my hair lots of volume. Light...does not wrigh down hair. Easy to work through my hair.</li>
    <li> This product works better than any of the many I have tried. It does keep the style as advertised  If possible, I will not be without this volume spray.  A very happy customer!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works, tried other volume sprays, nope, they did not do the job.&lt;br /&gt;To bad it priced kinda of high, but, &amp;#34;you pay for what you get&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This product does well for fine hair!</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this spray.  I have very fine, straight, shoulder length hair and have tried so many expensive and inexpensive products to give my hair volume and bounce.  This product does both and lasts all day...rain or shine!!!  Just spray on damp hair and style.  Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> I will not be buying this again, or any of the other products I have very fine hair and I was not expecting it to dry out my hair in order to get volume. I am not willing to live with that result. very disappointed</li>
    <li> This volumizer really does last for 48 hours.  Can&#x27;t go without it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have thin straight hair, and this spray holds it up pretty good without sticking them together. I can brush it out easily unlike most hairsprays that i used to use. I also love the way it smells.</li>
    <li> One of the best brands on the market for all types of hair.</li>
    <li> It make my hair. which has thinned over the years, appear thicker and easy to manage, not sticky or gummy.</li>
    <li> This is THE only product that works like a dream. I&#x27;ve been losing hair slowly and steadily for years, and consider myself somewhat of an expert on products&#x27; ability to either slow the process or give the illusion that there is actually no loss. This is the only product I have found where I even am forced to do a double-take in the mirror, as I am shocked that my hair, after all of these years, is truly thicker, not just visibly-so, but by feel and texture. AMAZING!!</li>
    <li> My sister told me about this product after seeing it on the Today show- I decided to give it a try.....It has worked miracles for me. My hair definitely is fuller etc. It will always be a staple in my hair product supplies!</li>
    <li> Incredible product.  Holds hair without being sticky or stiff.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a long time now &amp; love it! I have fine straight hair &amp; this volume spray helps more than almost any other produce I have used to give extra body &amp; lift. It separates the hairs, giving  a current stylish look…I spray it on &amp; crunch my hair up &amp; then blow dry. I would have give this product a 5 star rating but the spray although it has a lot of good ingredients can choke the air up &amp; make it had to breath.</li>
    <li> Love it for my fine hair</li>
    <li> Worth every penny!  Really adds body to fine hair.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample and was so impressed I bought a full size of the product plus the shampoo to go with it. It made my thin hair feel and look much thicker and fuller and did not weight my hair down. A few sprays are all you need so it will last a long time, it is cost effective. Highly recommended for thin hair.</li>
    <li> Adds volume, but kind of makes hair stick to itself (similar to hairspray). Light, inoffensive scent.</li>
    <li> I have kind of fine hair.this product works wonders in giving it volume. And it does last for 48 hours with a quick touch up</li>
    <li> UNDENIABLY one of the BEST volumizing products I have ever used!!  Hope for my fine-textured hair!!  Applied to wet, freshly washed hair (let it rest there before blow drying), this volumizer struts its stuff for days...GREAT stuff!!  Amazon proves a much easier place to purchase one of my favorite hair products!!</li>
    <li> Smells heavenly - like a green field - and leaves my fine highlighted hair soft and full of body after blowdrying. Sometimes I use Bamboo Mousse afterward for more lift at the crown but this does the job most days. I only use 5 spritzes and work it into the roots.</li>
    <li> Great product - delivers volume without tacky or &amp;#34;too-much product&amp;#34; feeling and I really like the scent love Alterna products in general!!</li>
    <li> It gives my hair a sun-bum kind of look. It looks like I came from the beach. Is it life changing? I wouldn&#x27;t say so, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect something like that from something topical. Smells very strongly though (I usually use a lot of all natural and organic products and don&#x27;t use perfumes or use scented products), so I try to hold my breath when applying. Works only if you combine it with a blow-dryer. Air drying doesn&#x27;t create enough lift on its own.</li>
    <li> Definitely plumps the hair up without drying.  My hair is still left silky smooth but with a thicker look to it.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Alterna Bamboo 48 Hour Sustainable Volume spray for my fine, limp hair.  This product has a light scent to it but it goes away quickly after applying.  This comes in a 4.2 fl.oz. bottle and the bottle indicates that this product will &amp;#34;instantly thicken each strand, amplifying full-bodied, all-over volume by 105% with results that last for 48 hours&amp;#34;.  I apply this to towel dried hair before applying my heat protectant spray.  After drying my hair with a hairdryer I do notice my hair has more lift and body.  This is a great product for anyone but especially those with hair like mine.  Also if you are looking for a great shampoo and conditioner also from the Alterna line I would like to suggest [[ASIN:B001FYV0HM Alterna Caviar Replenishing Moisture Shampoo &amp; Conditioner Duo (8.5 oz each)]].  The caviar shampoo and conditioner are amazing and pair it with this spray for great results.</li>
    <li> I received a sample in one of my subscription beauty boxes.  It is one of the best hair treatments I have tried.  My hair is much fuller and appears to be more healthy -- while not being to heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome</li>
    <li> This product used in combination with the shampoo and conditioner really plumps up fine limp hair.  I wash my hair daily so I can&#x27;t speak to the 48 hour issue but it really makes a difference even with daily washing.</li>
    <li> Did absolutely nothing to sustain hairstyle!  Would not recommend</li>
    <li> Great product; adds volume without making hair sticky.  Have tried many and this is the best!  Highly recommend to men or women.</li>
    <li> Works great on my thin striaght hair, I rarely recommend anything for my hair as they never work.  This does.  Love it have used it for more than a year now.</li>
    <li> Another great Alterna product!  I use this with the heat protector spray.  One pumps up the volume and the other protects my fine, thin hair from the blow dryer.  I&#x27;m on my second or third bottle at this point.</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine hair and this gives such a great amount of volume ...never makes my hair feel like straw. Softness and hold-ability..who could ask for more!</li>
    <li> I have very fine, limp hair and saw this advertised on QVC. I always compare prices and found it less expensive on Amazon. I received it in 3 days with no shipping (thanks to Prime). I LOVE IT. I use it right after shampooing and the body that remains in my hair is fantastic. I will be ordering more, so PLEASE don&#x27;t run out! :)</li>
    <li> This is one of the best hair products I have ever used for volume and just great feeling hair.I originally ordered one (1) bottle and within a couple of days of using it, I ordered my second one.I find the ALTERNA products to be superior. I also use the KENDI OIL and love it. I also use the BAMBOO hairspray and it gives your hair shine and hold. Love everything I have ordered. Thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this with the shampoo, conditioner and styling products of the same Bamboo brand. I wasn&#x27;t impressed with any of the products except this. The 48 Hour Sustainable volume spray works great. I honestly don&#x27;t know if it lasts 48 hours. I&#x27;ve never lasted 48 hours myself, but it did give my hair the boost it needed at my roots that lasted throughout my work day. No stiff sticky tacky feeling.  Shiny pretty full looking hair. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This gives volume but feels like I need to use so many sprays even on my short hair which will deplete the 4 ounces too fast. I like a foam mousse better , therefore I prefer the Alterna Bamboo Volume Uplifting Root Blast-7.3 oz. which works well in spite of the kooky nozzle which breaks easily and the is awkward to handle after it breaks.  I wish they would fix/improve the nozzle to the type where you just push down on it to get the foam to come out.</li>
    <li> Not the same product I buy in the salon. It was watered down. Did not create the volume it claimed. I have been using this product for a year. This is my first time buying it on amazon. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> ok... I waited until I&#x27;ve used almost the full bottle before writing this review.  During this time, I&#x27;ve been teased (no pun intended!) into trying other products, but I keep going back to this one.  The others just don&#x27;t work for my baby-fine hair.  Relatively short, and about average thickness, but definitely very fine.  And I live in a very humid climate.  Alterna Bamboo is the volume spray I&#x27;ve settled on... probably forever.  I&#x27;m no longer tempted to try other products that turn out to be a waste of $$.  This may be a bit more $ than what you find at your local drug/discount store... but IMHO... it&#x27;s worth it!  p.s.  No Scent!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t experienced the results that the Alterna volumizer product had promised. I noticed a little difference in my hair texture, but it didn&#x27;t keep any lasting volume as described in advertising. Disappointed...</li>
    <li> thought bamboo would make my hair thicker, but really could not tell the difference,  I use Nioxin products and can tell the difference in thickness of my hair.</li>
    <li> The very best stuff on the market to keep a style on baby fine &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; hair!  This is my second bottle, seven squirts in the hair, rub it in &amp; style as usual......... Violia!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this volume spray.  It sprays on nice and light and adds a distinct amount of volume to my fine, processed hair.  I&#x27;ve had problems keeping frizz at bay without creating limpness.  I have blonde hair that is colored and the Alterna Bamboo products have been my saving grace.  The price is right, they smell great and really deliver on making my hair look its best.</li>
    <li> I used this with the shampoo and conditioner...and it works great!!!! Give it a try and you&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
    <li> Usually a huge fan of Alterna Bamboo, but I don&#x27;t think this product anything but make your hair smell marginally better.</li>
    <li> Ok, bought two to get a better price.  I have very fine hair really didn&#x27;t work for me, better products out there.</li>
    <li> works as advertised - after using it several times a week (after each shampooing), it convinced me that my hair was now naturally thick, so I stopped using it, and found out I was in denial. I resumed using it.  It helped me through a period of thinning hair after weight loss and hormonal changes, and now with my hair healthier, I don&#x27;t have to use it as often. But I really appreciate that it&#x27;s the only product that was effective during that year of being so self-conscious</li>
    <li> One of the best hair products for adding volume I have ever tried.  It also takes care of the frizzy ends.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product. I am 60 years old and have shoulder length, layered, thin hair that is thinning!  I tried spraying this product on wet hair )(as per instructions), making sure that the product was throughout, and the results were pretty good. But this is how I use it now and I love the thickness and volume my hair appears to have. I wash my hair and let it air dry. Then as I am using my hot rollers, I spray each section of hair before wrapping around the hot roller. After I get all the rollers in my hair, I spray another light coat all over my &#x27;rollered&#x27; head. I leave the rollers in until completely cool. Then I brush my hair with my head &#x27;up-side-down&#x27; and when I flip my hair back--voila--full hair and after styling and a using a  light hair spray, my hair is fantastic and lasts for a couple of days (with minimal fix-up the second day)!!</li>
    <li> Does give more volume to my hair. Makes the style last for about 2 days.  Very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Too heavy and stiff for thin hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best volumizer of the thousands I have tried!  OK, I haven&#x27;t literally tried thousands, it just feels that way.  My hair is fine textured, limp and thinning in the front.  Most post-shampoo volumizers make my hair feel sticky; result in helmet hair; or do absolutely nothing for me.  Some root lifters make my scalp itch.  (What&#x27;s up with that???)  This Alterna product is fabulous!  I lightly spray a little of it on my clean, damp hair and work it through to the ends.  Then I blow it dry using my fingers to lift it up.  My hair looks full (vs. plastered to my head), soft and shiny.  For me the volume lasts about two days or until I do a sweaty workout, whichever comes first.  This product is the best!</li>
    <li> See prior review, Love it!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It is not sticky if you don;t overuse it and it really does the trick to add volume to my thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I thought the results would be.  My hair is very fine, this product didn&#x27;t really make enough difference for the amount it cost.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This hair thickener does help thicken and hold a style longer especially if you have fine hair.</li>
    <li> I love most Alterna products, but this is not one of them.  This leaves my hair feeling dirty, even when I only apply a tiny amount.  I have very fine hair and this may be why it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from the reviews I read and wish I could return it.  I have enjoyed all the products I have purchased from Alterna, however this one made a comb difficult to go through my hair and also made it sticky, whether I used a small amount or a larger amount.  No happy medium here.  It resulted in me pulling some of my long hair out.  Not a happy customer and very disappointed I could not return it.  Threw it away.  Sorry Alterna, not for me and my hair is in excellent condition, it wouldn&#x27;t have been if I continued with this product.</li>
    <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve used that helps my fine hair hold curl without it feeling heavy and getting oily quickly.</li>
    <li> Pretty good.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair noticeably thicker, but definitely gives my hair a lot of lasting body.  I washed my hair Sunday and it&#x27;s still going strong on Tuesday, with just minor touch-ups in the morning.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This product left my hair a little stiff since I don&#x27;t normally blow dry my hair.</li>
    <li> This works great with fine hair and it is very soft love this</li>
    <li> Gives my hair fullness and shine when I use the flat iron.</li>
    <li> This product really does what it says. I have very fine blonde hair that I usually have to style every day.  With this product, I have thick full hair that holds up beautifully the next day.  Using this is a no-brainier.  And I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> I discovered this product by accident as a sample in a gift bag from my local Ulta store.  I have fine thin hair and always use some sort of product to give my hair texture and body.  I have found a couple of sea salt sprays from two different brands that I really like, but once I used this, I decided that these is even better.  Love being able to order it cheaper from Amazon - also very convenient, since the store always seems to be out of it when there is a sale - LOL!!</li>
    <li> I have the worst hair in the world, thin, fine limp.  This actually does give you 48 hrs. sustainable volume. This is my second day, and my hair still has some volume. Usually it would be totally limp.  First(I mean the first!) time any volumizing product has worked for me!!</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time I ordered this product. I heard about it on a GMA and decided to give it a try. The promise was thicker more textured hair for those of us with baby fine strands. Well they delivered! I have tried every product on the market. My hair is shoulder length, very fine and not real full. Alterna gives my hair texture and thickness I have not found in any other product. I love it and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I finally found a product that adds volume to my extremely fine hair without stiffness or stickiness.  My favorite out of the many I have tried.  I have just reordered it.  Give it a try.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> My hair is rather thin so I didn&#x27;t expect much. I don&#x27;t see a huge difference after using it but it does help with styling and I like the smell a lot.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of favorable Amazon reviews. It gives fine hair a lot more body and volume. I like the light scent also.</li>
    <li> I love this product; my hair looks thicker and I am finding that I can style the way that I want it to.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and unfortunately as I get older my hair is getting thinner.  Alterna&#x27;s Bamboo Sustainable Volume hair spray is my favorite product to make my hair feel fuller and thicker.</li>
    <li> This did not give me volume for 48 hours.  I have lots of fine, blonde hair that I am always searching for the ultimate product to give me volume, movement, and hold all in one.  All I expected from this product was the volume.  I felt like it weighed my hair down, extended dry time and I saw no noticeable difference with and without my other product line up.  Finally, Alterna products are far too expensive to not fulfill SOME of their promises!</li>
    <li> I finally found something that works! I love the way my hair looks and feels it gives volume to your hair without adding weight.</li>
    <li> Amazing improvement in detangling (processed hair) after just 4 or 5 sprays.</li>
    <li> this didn&#x27;t work for me at all...</li>
    <li> Nothing beats Wen treatment spray and taking hair maxx from ultrax pills  I was getting expensive extension for volume</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT. REALLY DOES ADD EXTRA VOLUME TO HAIR. I HAVE REALLY STRAIGHT FINE HAIR AND NEED EXTRA VOLUME AND THIS REALLY DOES THE JOB. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
    <li> Exactly like the one that I paid $27 for in the salon.</li>
    <li> Great product. The first day I used this, I noticed that I didn&#x27;t need to adjust or correct my pony tail during the day; I have thin and soft hair, so I&#x27;m used to constantly correcting my hairstyle throughout the day because pony tail holders and clips will just slide out my hair (braids will also come undone). Now everything stays in place because my hair is noticeably thicker.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! It works! I have baby fine hair, color treated for many years. Just a few squirts on the roots after shampooing and after styling, my hair appears to have at least twice the volume. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky at all. It&#x27;s well worth the price, I&#x27;m totally sold.</li>
    <li> I love the Bamboo Products.  I have very fine, frizzy hair and this 48H volumizer makes my hair look much fuller and bouncier.  I&#x27;ve used the \\&quot;exandable strand\\&quot; pump lotion too but didnt like it nearly as well.  This doesnt try my hair out at all either like alot of volumizers do.</li>
    <li> I did to feel it was as great as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;I have had less expense products far better.  I do not think I would recommend it to my friends.  I really did not see where&lt;br /&gt;It made any difference</li>
    <li> Back to the drawing board. This product does not live up to what I have read about.  It just does not do what it claims. It left my hair awful.</li>
    <li> You might think it&#x27;s strange that a girl would want to find a product that made her hair less silky, but if you had the fine hair I did, you&#x27;d def be interested. Although I have a fair amount of hair, the silkiness often made it look flat, no matter what levl of blow-out was done to it. I received this from a coworker who gets freebies on the regular and put off trying it out for a while. Boo on me, it turns out. This stuff is INCREDIBLE. It helped my hair retain it&#x27;s smooth silky feeling without the frustrating flatness that sometimes comes with it. Not only does my hair look fuller, but I don&#x27;t have to work even half as hard with a round brush and hairdryer. Def bought an extra bottle from fear this product would somehow be discontinued. Magic, I say ... sheer witchery. I am a fan.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to say that this worked for me but it didn&#x27;t. I have very thin hair and can&#x27;t expect miracles, but I did not see much change in the texture and volume.</li>
    <li> Great way to plump your hair and feels so much thicker once you dry your hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent thickener, Volumizer, &amp; root-lifting long lasting product!</li>
    <li> Has anyone else using this product noticed that their fingernails are getting stronger, too.  Makes sense.  I like the volume it is adding to my hair AND the strength it is giving to my nails.</li>
    <li> i have fine colored hair. this product gives lots of volume without the weight. would recommend this product to  anyone who needs volume</li>
    <li> I find this product does indeed provide the volume I am looking for, and it lasts a couple of days.  I wish it was less expensive, however.</li>
    <li> There was nothing wrong with this product as far as it being what it was supposed to be, on time, etc. I wanted so badly to love this shampoo &amp; conditioner set after reading reviews and loving other Alterna products. I have fine, somewhat thin hair and had high hopes for this set &amp; was super disappointed. The smell was masculine (not bad, just not my preference) and it left my hair feeling so dry. It felt as if I&#x27;d just did a deep cleanse without conditioner. While it did add some volume, it was minimal &amp; I couldn&#x27;t deal with the way it left my hair feeling. If you guys are looking for a good shampoo &amp; conditioner, try Alterna&#x27;s Caviar Repair Instant Recovery set. It&#x27;s amazing and leaves your hair feeling fabulous. I wish I had better things to say about this volumizing set.</li>
    <li> Really does make my hair look like it has more volume, and the day after looks even better. Can be drying over time, so I only use for special public times, not necessarily every workday. Love it, and even tho it&#x27;s a bit pricey, I don&#x27;t need much each use so it lasts.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine and oily, and I have to shampoo it every day, but it still looks limp and lifeless by lunchtime. A few spritzes of this product on my towel-dry hair gives me a body I have never known before, and I can even go a day sans shampoo, for all the lift it gives me. YaY Alterna Bamboo!</li>
    <li> Perfect product. Arrived on time, and as described.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I ordered after reading all the reviews I thought oh yeah another product that is going to make my hair actually look thicker - well I used it this morning and guess what it actually does ! I have used so many things as my hair is thinning and fine ( great combination !) and this does a terrific job of making my hair appear thicker and hold a style and it smells wonderful !</li>
    <li> This product really gives my hair a lot fuller!</li>
    <li> This is a good product for the hair.  Just be careful that you don&#x27;t use too much or else your hair will get stiff while styling.</li>
    <li> Great price! Quality was right on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Linda D.</li>
    <li> I have very straight hair and live in Hawaii where there is high humidity.  My hair holds its style much better with this product.  It is a little expensive for the size, but will continue to order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I like it very much - came on time from the seller</li>
    <li> I have really thin hair. This stuff works and it doesn&#x27;t leave a weird residue.</li>
    <li> My hair is so fine. Old age I guess. But this product really makes you feel confident. Does just what they claim. A great product.</li>
    <li> It is a nice product, I just could have lived without.</li>
    <li> this product is too heavy for those of us with thin or fine hair.  it simply weighs the hair down.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic!  Another item I had to have after my stylist used it on my hair.  It REALLY does hold your style for an additional day.  I have bought several of these for myself and for stocking stuffers.  All recipients were thrilled to receive it and of course, expect it every year in their stocking.  You will not be disappointed with this product.  I use many items in the Alterna line and have not been disappointed in any of them.  This is worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have used it a couple of times and although I continue to use it, it doesn&#x27;t give extreme volume. My hair is thick and coarse. I still like the smell though</li>
    <li> Turned my granny hair to teenager hair. I am shocked!  This is my hair?  I can&#x27;t even believe it. I&#x27;ve used other Bambbonoroducts, shampoo, conditioner, volumizing foam. This is by far the biggest miracle product.</li>
    <li> Shine, hold and wonderful smell.  I love this line of products and recommend them for daily use for strong, healthy hair.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this product to me to help add volume to my super thin hair. It really makes a difference when I remember to use it. It smells really good too. I would highly recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> This volume spray is just great!  It gives boost and volume to my limp, fine and straight hair!  Love it!!</li>
    <li> I normally have to wash every day and still have limp, sad hair; this stuff let&#x27;s me wash and dry my hair before bed and then go two days with just light dry shampoo on the second day. Plus the smell is lovely, and I&#x27;m picky.</li>
    <li> Terrific product.Does exactly as it claims.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts forever.Would not travel without it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I saw it mentioned on the Today show and thought I would give it a try.  I love it.  I have very straight hair with little body.  Some products I have tried work but leavy my hair feeling stiff and sticky.  This does not. And it really does last 48 hrs!  Very pleased with this so far.</li>
    <li> I spray this in my roots when my hair is still wet the use the blow dryer to get some extra volume. I love this product because it is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down...smells good too!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best hair products I&#x27;ve used. I have very fine, straight hair and usually have to wash and style it every day because it won&#x27;t hold a style for more than 24 hours. A friend introduced me to Alterna 48 hour Volume spray and WOW what a difference. It leaves my hair shiny and full of volume. It has a really nice scent, too. The best part is that the spray really holds a style for 48 hours. I can skip a day washing/styling my hair if I want to. I liked the product so much that I started using Alterna Volumizing Shampoo and Conditioner. Using these products with the spray gives my hair volume I never thought I&#x27;d see. LOVE these products!!  [[ASIN:B006J6R23M Alterna Bamboo Abundant Volume Shampoo and Conditioner Set (8.5 Oz Each)]]</li>
    <li> this product actually helps to thicken your hair.  I love it</li>
    <li> I use it afer every shampoo and it has given my thin hair a body boost. It gives my hair a nice shine and boosts the volume so it looks as if my hair is thicker than it actually is and the body does last the 48 hours, second day is better than the first!</li>
