    <li> Does not last. Sticky and difficult to apply</li>
    <li> The product works great but I can&#x27;t put it in my purse because it leaks if not stored upright- no matter how tight I close it</li>
    <li> L love the lip sense lip color and gloss. I have reordered it many times.</li>
    <li> Will never be fooled by another lip product.  Have used this along with the LipSence Blue/Red color for years!</li>
    <li> I saw this at a Christmas craft show near our home and did not take time to listen to the representative but they gave me a sample.  I tried this product and I liked it.  I have very chapped lips and this was good for me all day by itself.  I ordered this one and I am very pleased with it.  I use it alone or over other lip colors.  It helps the lipstick stay on until I eat.  If you use it alone, it keeps you from constantly licking your lips to moisten them.  I believe this is a good product and I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This lipsense gloss worked great along with Lipsense lipstick. It wasn&#x27;t sticky at all. Loved it! It was a Good purchase and came in on time.</li>
    <li> I have the lipsticks and needed some gloss.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used LipSense for years.</li>
    <li> I used to have such bad chapped lips with constant peeling.  It even made the skin around my lips peel and gave me a whitish look.  I have been using this product for over 15 years and it is the only thing that keeps me from licking my lips and I have gotten my real lips back!  I mix a dark lipstick into the glossy and it makes for a super perfect/custom lip gloss color that I add over lip liner pencil lips.  This creates great depth and I get so many compliments on my smile. Please do try it.  Yes, it&#x27;s sticky but the key is your lips can finally not be chapped.</li>
    <li> Good product that goes with the Lip Colors I ordered.</li>
    <li> Works great with my lip stain.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and needed if you use LipSence</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It gives me very soft lips.</li>
    <li> All of the lip sense is great. I&#x27;ve gotten most of my friends wearing it. It doesn&#x27;t come off , and the gloss keeps your lips moist.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t keep the lipstick stay on as the way it used to.  I have to reapply constantly.</li>
