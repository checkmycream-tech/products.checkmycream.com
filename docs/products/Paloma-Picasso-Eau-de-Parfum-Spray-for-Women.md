<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I purchased this to replace a bottle that unfortunately was left behind in a hotel room earlier this year. Of course (!) it wasn&#x27;t found but I bet there&#x27;s a great smelling maid at the El Dorado in Reno! This &#x27;new&#x27; bottle isn&#x27;t the wonderful perfume I remember. Seems like it might be a little old which makes sense if the scent is no longer being made. Disappointed and have learned my lesson: will check thoroughly for left-behind articles before I depart hotel rooms in the future.</li>
    <li> This has been my go to for over 20 years.  I love it.</li>
    <li> For Many years I just have usted this parfum and I recommended this provider. This parfum is a perfect gift for mature And elegant womens.</li>
    <li> When I met my wife she was wearing this perfume. I love the smell of it. When have traveled women have asked her what the name of her perfume is. This has a very enticing smell. Will buy forever. Great price on this, it is a lot more expensive else where.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended..it is great perfume! The perfume arrived in a timely manner and was exactly the product I wanted. I&#x27;ve enjoyed this fragrance for  a few years now! It was a little pricey but worth it!</li>
    <li> Now the only place I can get my favorites perfume. Thank you. As always Amazon is fast and price competitive, so important for people who are at work and totally dependent on mail order shopping. I look forward to doing more shopping on your website as do my daughter and grandson.&lt;br /&gt;Denise Colston.</li>
    <li> This is the only perfume my wife uses.  She loves this stuff.  This was the second time I purchased this from Amazon and both times it was delivered without trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely would recommend and buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful perfume. Smells great and the product is just as described.</li>
    <li> This fragrance was bought for me from Amazon as a gift.  It&#x27;s a counterfeit.  I&#x27;ve used this for yrs. But usually buy it from Dillards . When we got this thru Amazon it smelled old &amp; stuffy.  In fact we&#x27;ve bought other fragrance thru Amazon &amp; they were counterfeit also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be advised that name brand fine fragrance should be bought from fine department where it&#x27;s in secure wrapping.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time. One of the best perfumes!</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery. Product was correct. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> fragrance is so strong that I have to wash it off, dry it and then go out.  Still a strong smell.</li>
    <li> Bottle was thicker than those in the store. The sent was a littlee different. I have beeen wearing this perfume for over 30 years so I can notice a difference. All and all it was close enough especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  I smelled it on a neighbor and had to get it.  It smells so good, not too fru-fru, just low key and classy.  I will keep using this perfume.</li>
    <li> AGAIN I VAN FIND WHAT SHE LOVES  TOO!!!</li>
    <li> My wife is a retired major cosmetics and fragrances developer. She has a handicap that I have never encountered: any perfume, eau de parfum, cologne and such that she uses, turn nauseatingly sweet on her skin.&lt;br /&gt;After trying them all, or almost, my wife found, thirty years ago, the only perfume that stays stable on her body: The Eau de Parfum by Paloma Picasso. She is sentenced for life to wear it.&lt;br /&gt;As for myself, I am lucky that the only perfume she can wear is the best I ever sampled myself.</li>
    <li> please send me the perfume paloma picasso, you are terrible[[ASIN:B000BTO6EG Paloma Picasso By Paloma Picasso For Women, Eau De Parfum Spray (3.4 Ounces)]]</li>
    <li> A birthday gift,and just what she wanted</li>
    <li> Good price and very quick service for a product that I wanted.  I recommend buying this product as many others enjoy it too.</li>
    <li> a classic...just what you expect</li>
    <li> Excellent price for the amount.  Thanks</li>
    <li> My favourite fragance! I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many new perfumes, and always come back to Paloma Picasso.  My all time favorite!  Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> This looks like the real thing, but doesn&#x27;t smell quite the same. The packaging was not sealed as in other packages I have purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still love the scent, and the price is right.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use this perfume for over 20 years.... I would recommend this highly! This is the only perfume I wear. People ask me what I&#x27;am wearing all the time.</li>
    <li> give as a gift very much loved</li>
    <li> i am very please with quality and discount price.  that is why i shop amazon.</li>
    <li> Love it!  And it&#x27;s the most reasonably priced Paloma Picasso I&#x27;ve found anywhere</li>
    <li> This is the &amp;#34;Scent of a woman&amp;#34;, Love it!</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL AND IT LAST FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND DOES NOT GO BAD.</li>
    <li> No complaints, recipient (who has been wearing this perfume for years) loved it.</li>
    <li> If you are like me and loved this perfume in the 90s, this is not the perfume for you. It smells nothing like it did. Too floral and light.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and was so glad to find it on Amazon since I can never find it in stores accept Christmas time.  I would say I&#x27;ve gotten complimented on this perfume at least once a week since I started wearing it which was 10 years ago.  I kid you not!!!  Some girls like Chanel but for me - I&#x27;m a Picasso girl.  (hate his paintings though)</li>
    <li> I am very pleased that it is still available.</li>
    <li> I had a friend that used to wear this perfume years ago. I saw it on a ad and I always wanted to try it for myself. I did finally and I just love it. It smells so good. I get so many complements about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a woman looking to spoil yourself with something new try this.&lt;br /&gt;I guarantee you will love it just as much as I do.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been around for 30 years and it is still in style. My mom&#x27;s favorite perfume&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a gift for an older woman - you can&#x27;t go wrong with Paloma Picasso</li>
    <li> This is not the &amp;quot;real thing&amp;quot;. I have been using Paloma Picasso Eau De Parfum for at least 15 years so I know what the &amp;quot;real thing&amp;quot; smells like and so does my husband. Either this is a fake or it is so old that the fragrance has changed.&lt;br /&gt;Whichever it is, I feel as though I have been cheated. Unfortunately I cannot return it because it has been opened and tried.&lt;br /&gt;However, I would like to caution others not to trust this vendor based on my experience.&lt;br /&gt;I give this a ZERO STAR rating, no matter what the review publishes because I noticed there are 2 stars and I cannot change that now.</li>
    <li> This is the best price I have seen for this perfume.  It is almost double the cost at local department stores.  It arrived promptly and was a great gift for my mother.</li>
    <li> I personally do not like strong fragrances, but everyone has their own taste.  My sister loves this parfum.  The bottle is cute too.</li>
    <li> The Paloma Picasso perfume arrived in perfect condition, in a very short period of time.  As always, excellent service from Amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for over 15 years and have gotten so many compliments on it.. People tell me I smell good, what are u wearing etc.. My husband gave me a bottle over 15 years ago and I&#x27;m hooked for life!</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite perfume. Skeptical at first because of the low price, but it was the real thing at a great price. Packaging was well done to protect the product. Arrived as promised.</li>
    <li> I always get compliments on this scent.  It is beautiful. It can definitely be used for special evenings or anytime you want to smell terrific!</li>
    <li> So happy I purchased this,  it is the real thing. Fast delivery, will be buying this again in the future.</li>
    <li> I love wearing this perfume and no matter where I go I always receive compliments when i wear Paloma Picasso!</li>
    <li> I received this order quickly, and it was in excellent condition.  I would purchase items in the future from this vendor without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery and as advertised.</li>
    <li> Paloma is her Go To fragrance, and this was exactly as can be bought in a Dept. Store. 50% savings.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, it has always been one of my favorites. The long lasting scent is NOT overpowering and I am continually complimented about its aroma.</li>
    <li> Got it fast at a great price. One of my favorite old perfumes. Very rich fragrance. I order it usually twice a year.</li>
    <li> I have used Paloma Picasso fragrance for several years. I really appreciate being able to make the purchase at a savings from Amazon. Paloma Picasso is more expensive at the retail stores in Houston, Texas.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn the same perfume for over 30 yrs, I&#x27;ve tried purchasing from those &amp;#34;Perfume shops&amp;#34; in the malls and can tell the difference in quality, Almost as if they are a watered down version, I&#x27;m always apprehensive to purchase from anywhere other than an expensive department store, but no more! The quality I received was exactly what I would expect from the expensive department stores, I will be buying my this from here from now on!</li>
    <li> Best perfume ever. I get more compliments when I ware this. Love it. AAA+++++</li>
    <li> Delivered as expected. Smelled just like I remembered from 30 years ago. I plan to order the body lotion as well.</li>
    <li> While I love the scent on my friend, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as wonderful on my though I like that it isn&#x27;t a sweet scent.</li>
    <li> Paloma is my favorite perfume...but this bottle doesn&#x27;t smell like my old bottle of perfume.  Did they change the formula?  Or did I get cheated by a fake perfume?  Perfume is one thing I will no longer buy online.</li>
    <li> I have always purchased this in a Department Store.  The cellophane wrapper wasn&#x27;t sealed in the usual tight way.  The perfume doesn&#x27;t quite have the scent I&#x27;m used to, its either old, or lost some of its original good scent in the &#x27;process&#x27;,&lt;br /&gt; since it wasn&#x27;t sealed the way I&#x27;m used to, I have to wonder, I won&#x27;t order this through Amazon again.</li>
    <li> It has enhanced my being for over 25 years</li>
    <li> THIS DID&#x27;NT SMELL LIKE MY OTHER BOTTLE IN COMPARISON. IT WAS A GOOD BUY, BUT AM WONDERING IF IT&#x27;S THE REAL THING!</li>
    <li> I have loved this perfume for years!  Smells wonderful.  Will continue to buy this product.  Be leary of the lotion though.</li>
    <li> When this was a new perfume years and years ago, I was sprayed while walking through my favorite clothing store and immediately thought, &amp;#34;This would be a nice Christmas gift for my daughter.&amp;#34;  It became her &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; scent, and she still requests it for Christmas.  The odd thing is that I never wear scent (bothered my students when I was teaching computer classes), and that might have been the only time I ever allowed someone to spray me in a store.  I sincerely hope it never disappears from the market.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Paloma Picasso for over 10 yrs and I ALWAYS come back to this.  If you like provocative spicy scents, than this one is for you.</li>
    <li> It was great to buy it online, I love the convenience. I use PALOMA PICASSO for many, many years and it was as good as ever this time around. Price was great as well. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Good price and fast delivery. Thank</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume and the price was very reasonable. I wish they still made the original which doesn&#x27;t include any synthetic notes. But it is still and always be my favorite.</li>
    <li> No fragrance. ..would not reorder.</li>
    <li> In the old days, they used a certain moss to make these finer perfumes last. It has been declared an &amp;#34;endangered species&amp;#34; in France, so now fine fragrances last only a short time. Though this scent is very much like the old &amp;#34;Paloma&amp;#34; perfume, it leaves rapidly, and you use more. Gone are the days where you spritzed the room and walked through the perfume! Still my favorite, I just use more.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed, loss of scent. Not sure if I was sold an older bottle of parfum or what the problem could have been.</li>
    <li> My wife has has been wearing Paloma Picasso for over 20 yrs. If you like spicy scents, than this one is for you, the longer you wear it the better it smells.</li>
    <li> Fragrance is favorite, so it is the same great product that was expected.</li>
    <li> I always get compliments on this perfume. People comment that it really does remind them of women in French movies. I now wear nothing else.  It&#x27;s part of my daily toilette.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal.  I&#x27;ve been using this perfume since it came out in the 1980&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Great buy for the price</li>
    <li> This was a very nice gift that I gave to my friend.  She was so excited to see this.  It has been years for her to experience this fragrance.  Brought back lots of memories for her.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years.  This was the best price I have seen.  I ordered 3 bottles.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is sophistication walking!</li>
    <li> Great Christmas present for the wife. She wears it often. I am obliged to buy this parfum for her every year. I am told that it is a great scent for the baby boomers!</li>
    <li> Bought a bottle for my wife for Christmas. The box and bottle look real but what is inside isn&#x27;t Paloma Picasso.</li>
    <li> Love this scent !  It was delivered quickly.  I gave this as a Christmas gift and it was very well received.</li>
    <li> The young woman loved this birthday present.</li>
    <li> Loved this since it first came out and am a repeat buyer!</li>
    <li> Excelente, mercadoria no prazo, em perfeito estado, o vendedor muito atencioso, forma de pagamento correta. Sem problemas com a mercadoria ou com o vendedor.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance but on the several occasional I purchased online I received imitations! I  believe this is not an impostor, but still wonder due to the fact it does not last...</li>
    <li> NICE ORIENTAL SPICE ALONG THE LINES OF MAGIE NOIR TYPE OF PERFUME.  IT JUST DOES NOT LAST LONG THOUGH.  I HAVE NOTICED THAT THEY ARE WATERING DOWN THE PERFUMES THESE DAYS AND YOUR MONEY&#x27;S WORTH IS BECOMING A THING OF THE PAST.  SO WITH THAT IN  MIND IM NOT SURE I WOULD PURCHASE ANOTHER BOTTLE BUT IT IS A WONDERFUL FRAGRANCE FOR AS LONG AS IT LASTS.</li>
    <li> excelente producto y el precio es el adecuado, estoy muy satisfecho con la compra y con el vendedor. Nada más</li>
    <li> pienso que no es original</li>
    <li> The perfume I received in the Paloma Picasso bottle is not Paloma. I have used the perfume for 25 years, and my husband and I agree it is definatly not Paloma Picasso</li>
    <li> I always loved this scent when a friend of mine wore it and decided to try it myself.  My order arrived promptly, it was very well wrapped and smells wonderful on me too.  I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and it does not react well to most perfumes!  We&#x27;ve been using Paloma for years!  The fragrance is embracing, it&#x27;s warm and stays on you and your clothes forever!!!!</li>
    <li> Te delivery was excelent and the product is A1</li>
    <li> Have been using it for years and always get compliments even from strangers who pass by.  They&#x27;d always want to know what the fragrance is, also lasts all day.</li>
    <li> this is the au de parfume, better than au de toillette. great perfume and if you can find the $100ml for below $70 go for it! tax free at JFK will be more expensive</li>
    <li> great value on my favorite perfume, I have been wearing this for years and get many compliments on it. It is a wonderful spicy yet clean fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for summer. Try it!!</li>
    <li> This perfume is worth the price.  I have had lots of compliments.  I never tire of it.  It is very long lasting without being overbearing or too strong.</li>
    <li> Someone purchased this for me about 20 years ago &amp; it has since become my signature scent. I never leave home without putting it on. Then I forget it is on, can&#x27;t smell it but obviously others can. Thru the years, many people have asked me what perfume I am wearing...most often men asking because they want to buy it for their significant other. She&#x27;ll be glad you did!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m delighted with this purchase, it came on the expected delivery time. The only thing about it what that there was a dent and crease on the box when I opened it. I am gifting this item, so it&#x27;s the only thing that i wasn&#x27;t pleased about. As long as the perfume itself is in good condition that is all that matters.</li>
    <li> Horrible, took long, damaged item. Just horrible</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this scent for at least 30 years and absolutely love it. I constantly get compliments from both men and women on it. It is long lasting so one only needs to apply a little, making the bottle last all day. I recommend the Eau De Parfum rather than the cologne because it is more concentrated. This has become my signature scent! Love, love, love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this scent for the last thirty years.  Everywhere I go, people ask me what I am wearing and how good it smells.  I have tried to switch to other scents and have ended up never feeling as good as when I wear Picasso.  It has become harder to buy in stores and how thrilled I was to find it on Amazon and it was much less in price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this scent for over 10 years and even though I&#x27;ve tried to find a comparative fragrance I must say that I could never find a perfume that I love more than Paloma Picasso.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite scents. It is a classic scent that stays with you all day. It is no longer available in the department stores in my area. It was nice to find here and be able to purchase it. The size of the product is nice for the price. I have been a fan of this this product for years.</li>
    <li> mom loves this perfume and she was please with her gift...I drug my feet ordering this before Christmas and it was one of the items that didn&#x27;t make it in time but it she worked as a great present.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife for Christmas.  She loves.</li>
    <li> My moms favorite and was told from Macy&#x27;s they don&#x27;t make this fragrance anymore. So Christmas she was happy to see it</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my fragrance. I first bought this when living in Ireland over 26 years ago after smelling its lovely woodsy scent on a girlfriend.  I immigrated to the USA and only recently thought about this scent again.  I tried to get in duty free when we were travelling during Spring break but didn&#x27;t luck out.  So,  I went on-line to search.  Bingo!  I will admit when I used recently after so many years away from this it seemed overpowering but, after a little bit it was like the scent that I remembered so well and brought back vivid memories of when I wore it in my younger days.  You should use sparingly as it is strong and you don&#x27;t want to come across as overpowering.  My other favorite is Opium and again, a little goes a long way.  Hope this helped!</li>
    <li> Great perfume that has a subtle touch.  It is my wife&#x27;s favorite.</li>
    <li> However, It&#x27;s ok. Some years ago, I used to use it and i feel its fragance was more durable. But, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why I can&#x27;t find this perfume at any of the retail counters these days.  It is by far my favorite!</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance very much...I purchased it for my girlfriend who adores it and it smells so good on her that I will be buying one for myself very soon...</li>
    <li> The first time I purchased this perfume was at Robinson&#x27;s-I have a perfume bottle collection and kept the black bottle which still has the &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; of Paloma Picasso perfume. This is not the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; perfume, I will not purchase it again, I feel like I have been swindled.</li>
    <li> My ex wife loved it!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Paloma Picasso since I discovered it at 17 (yes, young but I knew a good fragrance!) But now in my forties, is my signature fragrance. I was very worried ordering it due to some reviews but what I recd today is the genuine product (I should know!) and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t the best quality product advertised.</li>
    <li> What a beautiful scent this has and one of my very favorites!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my mother - this perfume is what she usually uses but very difficult to find in stores. I researched prices and reviews and at the end decided to go with amazon. My mother had no complains and she still uses perfume so I think its safe to assume I will be buying again for next Christmas.</li>
    <li> My daughter used to use it when the economy was good. I wanted her to have what she loved so bought it for her Christmas gift in 2012.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend likes the scent, and the price was right.  I like it well enough, but I&#x27;m secondary in the line of importance on this topic.</li>
    <li> arrived on time and as expected</li>
    <li> imitation perfume seemed to me &amp;#60;(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for 25 years and still love it. It&#x27;s not sweet or flowery, but hard to describe. Thumb&#x27;s up!</li>
    <li> Very nice for a special someone.!!!</li>
    <li> I am happy with this purchase.  It arrived on time and will buy from this seller again.  Thanks</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents!  Price was great and shipped fast!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this perfume for years and I love it.  Can&#x27;f find it in local stores anymore.  Thanks for stocking it.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product which I order often the only problem was the top did not fit properly..Amazon fixed the problem</li>
    <li> I love love love this perfume. 20+ years now!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume I have used it for 25-30 years.</li>
    <li> My one and only perfume that I wear! &amp;#60;3 it! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn and loved this fragrance since the 1980s, and this bottle is no exception.  Delivery was made the very last day of a long window.  I&#x27;ll definitely purchase the fragrance again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful and special aroma. I have used this for so many years. It is subtle yet noticeable.</li>
    <li> Paloma Picasso it a great light smell I have been wearing this since 1990&#x27; I still have people commenting on how great I smell!  Only problem is I ordered this perfume and a second one Indigo. I was sent the wrong perfume from the Indigo seller, then Amazon did not pay them. After talking with the Amazon they we&#x27;re of no help.</li>
