<li> Lipstick is super dark which I was expecting</li>
<li> It shows big time with this particular color.</li>
<li> In real life it looks darker than it does in the picture, dark enough that my brother thought it was black before I put it on</li>
<li> Very long lasting!</li>
<li> This product doesn&#x27;t dry out cake up or anything.  </li>
<li> Again, like my other Ka&#x27;Oir review do not use chapped.</li>
<li> That can be expected from really dark lipstick though.  </li>
<li> and you could tell it was dark purple, but that&#x27;s what I was going for</li>
<li> at prom everyone didn&#x27;t even notice what I was wearing they were looking at the lipstick because it was so dark.</li>
<li> Got this a few weeks ago, and this week received two complements from other women on it.</li>
<li> soooo i&#x27;m a little nervous about that</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s a very dark purple.</li>
<li> I received broken.</li>
<li> but ill never order this brand unless i try it in stores if i had a choice i would put no stars</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I ordered this lipstick for two reasons, I think burgundy looks amazing on dark skin girls and for my prom. I love it so much, at prom everyone didn&#x27;t even notice what I was wearing they were looking at the lipstick because it was so dark. I go/went to a conservative school and no one would ever take the risk to wear another color of lipstick besides red. Everyone was like &amp;#34;where did you get it; it looks so good I want some&amp;#34;, so expect KA&#x27;OIR to get a lot of purchases coming out of Texas.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTLY LOVE my new lip color. Deliver was fast too. Received in about 4 days.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my sister and she looked great with this color! Whether you&#x27;re dark skinned or any other shade this color looks good! This product doesn&#x27;t dry out cake up or anything.  It&#x27;s lasting moisturizes and has a matte finish</li>
    <li> This is a deep Purple ! No matte finish at all ! I had to apply more than once and i still saw my lips pink undertone and it easily comes off.....Feels nice on the lips but ill never order this brand unless i try it in stores if i had a choice i would put no stars</li>
    <li> Love this color. Goes great with my complexion! First time I used this brand. I will be buying this brand again.</li>
    <li> Very pretty color. Very pigmented.  Be careful wearing light colors because it does stain. Quick delivery. The color was darker than anticipated but still love it.</li>
    <li> Goes on like BEAUTY SUPPLY LIPSTICK!!!!! Do NOT PURCHASE IF YOU WANT GOOD QUALITY LIPSTICK</li>
    <li> I really like this lipstick.  I personally have to wear lip gloss with it because if i don&#x27;t, the lip stick doesn&#x27;t go on evenly, so I would recommend getting some.  That can be expected from really dark lipstick though.  In real life it looks darker than it does in the picture, dark enough that my brother thought it was black before I put it on and you could tell it was dark purple, but that&#x27;s what I was going for anyway so I&#x27;m very pleased.  This color could look great on anyone, I&#x27;m very pale and it looks great but I&#x27;ve seen in other reviews people saying that they have darker skin and it looks great on them, which I don&#x27;t doubt.</li>
    <li> I received broken. But still cheaper and used with a lip brush</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this product only because of the great reviews I have been hearing about this company. When I received it I realized it was the color shown in the picture but had more of a purple hue add to it. Regardless of that it goes on smooth, you don&#x27;t need to reapply after a while because the color lasts all day, it keeps your lips really moisturized and it&#x27;s different. The name of this lipstick says it all. I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is NOT burgundy....it is a deep purple like a black/purple.  It looks NOTHING like the picture.  If you&#x27;re going for Goth, get this.  If not, keep searching.</li>
    <li> Another one of keyshia best..  I love it.. I get so many people asking me where I get my lip stick From.. keep make them wonderful long lasting lipsticks.</li>
    <li> My signature lipstick. A beautiful matte color. Very long lasting!</li>
    <li> Got this a few weeks ago, and this week received two complements from other women on it. Never had that happen before, so it must be something special.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, rich color.  Has good lasting ability.  Love it!  It is not drying. I have not had problems with it getting on my teeth.</li>
    <li> So in love with this sex color!!!!!!😍😍😍😍😍</li>
    <li> Lipstick is super dark which I was expecting but it doesn&#x27;t really last and it&#x27;s a super dry lipstick which I wasn&#x27;t happy about for all the money I paid!  Definitely not the same as a Benefit or Mac lipstick to charge about the same! Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Again, like my other Ka&#x27;Oir review do not use chapped. It shows big time with this particular color. It goes on very burgundy (rich). I love it!</li>
    <li> i look so sexy in this color and it looks great against my medium brown skin. it takes a couple of applications to get the deep red color but it looks great! would recommend!</li>
    <li> I just got mine today and I loved the way it looked on me now I want more I recommend that everyone get this color and other ka&#x27;oir products</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the items I received. Shipping was very fast</li>
    <li> This color and brand are wonderful, love how it looks on me.  Good, excellent color and staying power, and the price was OK.</li>
    <li> Perfect color! My second time purchasing from Ka&#x27;oir</li>
    <li> love it !! get soo many compliments with it, this lady actually asked me what name color it was cuz she like it soo much and i told her where to get it from :)</li>
    <li> It came in great timing, the color is amazing. It looks exactly how it does it the photo, it&#x27;s not misleading. You can wear gloss but its not needed.</li>
    <li> This lipstick is very rich and long lasting.  The color is very intriguing and catches everyone&#x27;s attention when you walk into the room. Its also easy to wash off after a long day of wear.  I am very pleased with the product and will purchase other colors in the near future!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this color and it&#x27;s a very dark purple. just like in the pic. but the one think that sets me off is that it gives off this alcohol smell......soooo i&#x27;m a little nervous about that but no worried. my lips are still fine lol</li>
    <li> My product just came today, the color matched the pic perfect and it only took a week. I love it !</li>
    <li> Excellent product!!! Loved the color. It is a great lipstick.</li>
