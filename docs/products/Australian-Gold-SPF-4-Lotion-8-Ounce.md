      <li>I now stock up on it for the summer because it&#x27;s the only one that is safe and effective for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>After thinking I was having an allergic reaction to the sun because I had some kind of red rash, one of my co-workers said that it was from my sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Worth the cost.</li>
      <li>I tried it last year and it was so great and simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Applies easily and remains effective even with excessive sweating.</li>

      <li>I have looked everywhere for this particular brand!</li>
      <li>It has no adverse reactions to my skin, smells great, works great and never once caused me to get one of those nasty rashes.</li>
      <li>However it does not soak in very well.</li>
      <li>Unlike most sunscreens, this goes on clear and dries almost instantly.</li>
      <li>This sunscreen smells better than any other sun protection product I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>This brand works better than any other sunblock/sunscreen we have tried.</li>

      <li>Also, their products have a fragarance that is soft.</li>
      <li>Australian Gold products in various SPF with bronzer are all worth the price for the ease of uniform application.</li>

<ol>
    <li> I love this brand, the tan it leaves you and the spray comfort. The only problem is the soooo short lasting</li>
    <li> Best and most favorite sunblock on the market.  Great smell, spray and coverage.</li>
    <li> I am one of those people that love to use sunscreen and I love this product. I first found Australian Gold SPF 30+ Continuous Spray in Hawaii at a good ol&#x27; ABC store.  It has a great beach scent, provides fantastic sun protection, sprays on evenly and it sprays on fairly dry, so you won&#x27;t be covered in oil. 2 weeks in Hawaii and NO sunburns for the adults and/or kids!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I returned home to WA state, I was disappointed to find that it is not available in my local drugstores. Gotta love Amazon.com once again for not only stocking it, but for selling it at a good price. Prime shipping is a bonus, too! [[ASIN:B000NDYY3S Australian Gold Continuous 6 oz. Spray SPF #30]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Australian Gold products, but this new spray is terrific. Covers well, works well, and just a great addition to the line.</li>
    <li> Australian Gold products are the best.</li>
    <li> Great smell. Does it&#x27;s job. Cheaper than ABC store. Many to choose from. They even have some with bronzer ,</li>
    <li> Unlike most sunscreens, this goes on clear and dries almost instantly. Has a nice aroma and has worked great for me during a summer of biking.</li>
    <li> I would definetely buy this again. Smells great, excellent coverage and I didn&#x27;t feel shelacked like some sprays make me feel.</li>
    <li> Love it and it smells fantastic!</li>
    <li> Love this sunblock. First found it on a cruise. It smells great, works like a champ, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and applies evenly. What&#x27;s more to like?</li>
    <li> Australian Gold products in various SPF with bronzer are all worth the price for the ease of uniform application. Also, their products have a fragarance that is soft.</li>
    <li> Smells good but coverage is bad. We burned even though we applied it every 30 minutes without being in the water...</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and oh so quick! I tried it last year and it was so great and simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;I love it! I have looked everywhere for this particular brand!</li>
    <li> Formula is sticky, and the nozzle broke after 2 uses. Biggest waste of $10 ever.</li>
    <li> This brand works better than any other sunblock/sunscreen we have tried. It does not leave your skin sticky like some and has a nice smell. This is the only brand we will now use.</li>
    <li> Only kind of sunscreen that keeps my very fair surfer son from burning.</li>
    <li> Best tanning spray there is...love the smell...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a spray SPF 30. The trigger isn&#x27;t too hard to squeeze with one hand. The spray comes out full and even for easy coverage. And it smells like heaven.</li>
    <li> Longest lasting water sunscreen I&#x27;ve found!  All day in Hawaii with only one reapplication...</li>
    <li> We keep the spray style Australian Gold in our car for those uh-oh need a quick application times. It is easy.  Goes on evenly. Works great. Like all spray-ons, the carrier can be obnoxious if not used in a well ventilated area.  Also excellent for a fast re-apply.  Worth the cost.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s cool and refresh to apply. a little  bit greasy though. not bad</li>
    <li> This sunscreen smells better than any other sun protection product I&#x27;ve ever used.  Applies easily and remains effective even with excessive sweating.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen applies easily, doesn&#x27;t smell horrible, and keeps me from getting sunburned (although I still get slightly tan). However it does not soak in very well. On the plus side this makes my skin shine, which is nice at the beach. On the bad side, no matter how long I wait, a grease ring develops around me as soon as I walk into the water. Works well on days when I just want to lay out and tan.</li>
    <li> Great product! love all of the Australian gold products so far!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m lazy so I need a spray on sunscreen. This Aussie Gold was recommended by a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply, pleasantly fragranced, and long lasting, this stuff helped keep my milky white skin burn free in the California sun.</li>
    <li> Love the feel, the smell, and most importantly the protection. Stays on all day even with frequent swimming and rinsing. Protects my skin from burning while still letting it tan. I have olive skin.</li>
    <li> Good spray lotion ..love it!</li>
    <li> Even and continuous distribution, delicious smell, all around great product.</li>
    <li> I will not go the Caribbean without several cans of this sunscreen. It is absolutely the best I have ever found. The scent is quite strong, but the effectiveness is worth it. I have it on auto shipment so I will never be without.</li>
    <li> This is not the first time I buy it and still love the product. Works great , no complains, would buy again.</li>
    <li> After thinking I was having an allergic reaction to the sun because I had some kind of red rash, one of my co-workers said that it was from my sunscreen. It was clogging my pores and giving me this bumpy rash. My brother said he&#x27;s seen these cheap sunscreens actually ooze back out of his skin. Completely nasty. My co-worker said that Australian Gold was the best and it is. Since using this product it changed my life. It has no adverse reactions to my skin, smells great, works great and never once caused me to get one of those nasty rashes. This is a great quality product. I use nothing else. I can only find it at Bed Bath and Beyond here in the midwest. I now stock up on it for the summer because it&#x27;s the only one that is safe and effective for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Product expired before I received it&lt;br /&gt;Everyone needs to check the expiration dates on items!!!</li>
    <li> Australian Gold always has the best smell.  The product quality to super.  And always can find it at a good price.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen and it is so convenient. I don&#x27;t need any help to spray it on my back</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too bad Australian Gold is sometimes hard to find in mass retailers. This is the BEST stuff. Has that great &amp;#34;vacation&amp;#34; fragrance. Easy press spray button. Goes on evenly. Stays long. Good protection.</li>
