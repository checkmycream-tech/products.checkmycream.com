      <li>And it even contains wine extract 😃 What could be better.</li>
      <li>I love the scent of this, but I do not notice a difference in the lip tint that others have mentioned in the comments.</li>
      <li>This would have been a great thing if they would have left out the rose smell.  </li>
      <li>But since using this, my lips are healthy and smooth.</li>
      <li>I know these tins last forever, but I&#x27;m already tempted to order more of this stuff because it&#x27;s great.</li>

      <li>Love the soft scent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m located in the United States, and this particular scent isn&#x27;t available in the United Statetes.</li>
      <li>Nice soft feel on your lips, not sticky or thick  tastes good two.</li>
      <li>Thanks!  </li>
      <li>It smells pretty, tastes good, and gives my lips a light, sheer pink tint.</li>
      <li>I would probably buy this again as a gift for someone that might not be willing to pay for fancy Vaseline.  </li>
      <li>In this tin, you get several grams more than the U.S.&#x27; lot.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing, too!  </li>
      <li>gives you the most smooth feeling with a tiny hint of bare lip color.</li>

      <li>Thanks so much</li>
      <li>arrived fast.</li>
      <li>I love the pink bubbly it does have a touch of wine in it --</li>
      <li>It is too much like perfume on my lips.  </li>
      <li>Anyone looking for a slightly thinner lip product than, say, Rosebud Salve, will LOVE this stuff.</li>
      <li>There is nothing particularly fancy about this Vaseline lip therapy.  </li>
      <li>Normally, I would never consider spending $10 on a Vaseline chapstick-</li>
      <li>There is a very light pink tint- just enough to make your lips look naturally pinker without anyone noticing that you have tint on.</li>
      <li>It smells great, it keeps my lips from getting chapped even in the Cold North, and it isn&#x27;t a stick, so</li>
      <li>Love this, not sure if it is the tin design, or the pretty pink color inside.</li>
      <li>I always enjoy the Vaseline lip balms as I suffer fom chapped lips all year round.</li>
      <li>Leaves lips soft</li>
      <li>leaves lips soft.  </li>
      <li>With a long winter effective my lips health, I&#x27;ve become addicted to Vaseline.</li>

      <li>I just adore limited edition packaging and extras on old standards.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>

<li> Didnt have a safety seal on it, but I am not sure if that is a standard.</li>

<li> It has the texture of all UK Vaseline tins (more slick than the US vaseline) and the same base scent (like the Aloe Vera) with a hint of wine.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s not very good and doesn&#x27;t even taste like champaign.</li>
<li> its a bit too thick</li>
<li> The gloss coats your lips without being thick or sticky.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s also very thin and wet to put on, I like a thick coating of Chapstick to moisturize my lips, but this is like nothing.</li>
<li> And it actually doesn&#x27;t taste bad, either.</li>
<li> I prefer the consistency of the Vaseline tins in the UK as opposed to the sloppy, goopy, sticky version in the US.</li>
<li> but the product itself feels weird on my lips.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;m located in the United States, and this particular scent isn&#x27;t available in the United Statetes. I love the pink bubbly it does have a touch of wine in it -- quite delish. Very moisturizing, too!  I prefer the consistency of the Vaseline tins in the UK as opposed to the sloppy, goopy, sticky version in the US. In this tin, you get several grams more than the U.S.&#x27; lot. I will order this, again, of course.</li>
    <li> The best. Leaves lips soft</li>
    <li> personally, I don&#x27;t like the taste at all. it&#x27;s not very good and doesn&#x27;t even taste like champaign. it&#x27;s also very thin and wet to put on, I like a thick coating of Chapstick to moisturize my lips, but this is like nothing. I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s $10!! wish I could send it back but i&#x27;ve had issues getting refunds before:/</li>
    <li> Really enjoyed receiving this lip balm. The smell is great and the formula is what you would expect from Vaseline. The tin is also a very cute item to have.</li>
    <li> Anyone looking for a slightly thinner lip product than, say, Rosebud Salve, will LOVE this stuff. It goes on light but you can apply more as desired, and it made my lips feel incredible. It seems to last quite a while, too, provided you&#x27;re not rubbing your lips together every two seconds. My favorite part of this stuff is the smell - it&#x27;s subtle but DELICIOUS. And it actually doesn&#x27;t taste bad, either. I know these tins last forever, but I&#x27;m already tempted to order more of this stuff because it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> This is basically Vaseline with a perfume scent.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this, but I do not notice a difference in the lip tint that others have mentioned in the comments. It is overall pretty great and arrived promptly</li>
    <li> This was given as a gift- shockingly from my father. He had read online (maybe Yahoo.com?) that this lip balm was amazing. He bought one for me and my mom. When I looked it up on Amazon, it had been $10 for the tin. Normally, I would never consider spending $10 on a Vaseline chapstick- but now that I&#x27;ve tried it and used it for a month- I would pay $20!!! I ALWAYS have chapped lips (probably dehydrated- oh well). But since using this, my lips are healthy and smooth. The gloss coats your lips without being thick or sticky. There is a very light pink tint- just enough to make your lips look naturally pinker without anyone noticing that you have tint on. This is AMAZING! I&#x27;ll never use anything else again! Buy this in bulk ladies!</li>
    <li> Love this lip gloss! I bought it since I liked the package, but when I opened it and tried it out, I loved it! You don&#x27;t need alot, alittle goes along way.</li>
    <li> This would have been a great thing if they would have left out the rose smell.  Packed good,  Thank you.</li>
    <li> bleack!  This tastes &amp; smells terrible.</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm so much. It smells pretty, tastes good, and gives my lips a light, sheer pink tint. I&#x27;m buying a couple more before they run out of stock.</li>
    <li> great product.  leaves lips soft.  smells lovely!</li>
    <li> Love it. Thanks so much</li>
    <li> I give this product 4 stars instead of 5 because of the price.  There is nothing particularly fancy about this Vaseline lip therapy.  It works as well as any other, including a generic petroleum jelly, so the price must be for the nice tin.  I would probably buy this again as a gift for someone that might not be willing to pay for fancy Vaseline.  Classy little luxury item.</li>
    <li> Thanks!  I bought two for each of my dressing areas.  I just adore limited edition packaging and extras on old standards.&lt;br /&gt;This gives you the most smooth feeling with a tiny hint of bare lip color.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used. It smells great, it keeps my lips from getting chapped even in the Cold North, and it isn&#x27;t a stick, so I can&#x27;t forget it in my jeans and send it through the wash.</li>
    <li> Mmmmm...this does smell so good! I think kind of like rose?...Very smooth. Makes my lips happy!</li>
    <li> arrived fast. Smelled great. Didnt have a safety seal on it, but I am not sure if that is a standard.</li>
    <li> Great product/seller/fast shipping overseas!</li>
    <li> Product arrived as pictured, however it has left my lips dry after a few uses.</li>

    <li> I always enjoy the Vaseline lip balms as I suffer fom chapped lips all year round. These handy very portable tins make it easy to keep your lips moisturized. I alys have some on hand and the choice of ingredients mean you are never bored with pain old Vaseline, although that is the base so works just as well as the others.</li>
    <li> Love the grapefruit taste! the container AND the pink color... so cool!!!</li>
    <li> I will admit the jar smells great but the product itself feels weird on my lips. its a bit too thick</li>
    <li> Love this-It&#x27;s by my bedside at all times! I am a lip balm junkie and this is my favorite! Love the soft scent.</li>
    <li> Love this product, as with all vaseline products. Nice soft feel on your lips, not sticky or thick  tastes good two.</li>

It has the texture of all UK Vaseline tins (more slick than the US vaseline) and the same base scent (like the Aloe Vera) with a hint of wine. Shipping was before schedule and properly secure in the packaging. Overall good buy.</li>
    <li> Oh how I wish this was sold in the U.S., but boy am I thankful to be able to buy it here.  I am a lip balm snob.  I&#x27;ve tried every kind and this is by far my favorite.  I won&#x27;t leave the house without it.  Gives the lips a light pink color and a perfect shine.  The flavor is so lovely.  Best ever!</li>
    <li> Love a hint of pink (and I do mean just a hint). This is good but I don&#x27;t care for the floral scent.</li>
    <li> I luv it &#x27; I just feel very unhappy with the shipping cost being so expensive. It was three times the amount of the product.</li>
    <li> Upgraded easy open tin.  Love this, not sure if it is the tin design, or the pretty pink color inside. Firmer than other tin balms. And it even contains wine extract 😃 What could be better.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this product and am very happy with it! Will order more!</li>
    <li> Excellent fast acting product. I noticed a difference in my dry lips after one application.  After two applications the skin was no longer peeling from my lips.  If you are a lip smacker and your lips peel, this will stop the peeling of your lips .Wonderful product.  Glad to have found it.</li>
    <li> I keep buying these and end up giving them away! Perfect balm with gorgeous scent. Super moisturizing without being greasy.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of the smell/taste.  It is too much like perfume on my lips.  The coverage is nice, but because of the other factors I will not be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Item arrived used -with visible signs of someones finger print - absolutely disgusting. No protective plastic or covering.&lt;br /&gt;Completly disappointed - though the lip balm smells amazing</li>
