      <li>he was very pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>It looks nice and of good quality.  </li>
      <li>I love this toothbrush!</li>

      <li>nice product.</li>
      <li>I have now used almost 2months and still on original batteries I put in and working great.</li>
      <li>I have an Oral B electric toothbrush that I loved but am going to travel so wanted something that would travel easily.  </li>
      <li>It works great for a couple of months and is incredibly powerful but it dies out after that.</li>
      <li>It does everything it says and more.</li>
      <li>Perfect for travel and it works well enough.</li>
      <li>It works better than the electronic one I have at home.</li>
      <li>so glad i got this toothbrush</li>
      <li>Plan to buy more for stocking stuffers.</li>
      <li>Okay</li>
      <li>While I like electric toothbrushes, and this one is ok, I do have some points I don&#x27;t like.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m buying more for my roommate</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also pleased that stains on my teeth are disappearing.</li>
      <li>It would be better for the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works better</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>It has been a great toothbrush so far.  </li>
      <li>That said, the thing I like the most about this product is that it does not take pressure to clean your teeth well.</li>
      <li>The battery is still going strong using twice a day.  </li>
      <li>The toothbrush works just fine.</li>
      <li>sonic toothbrush does a really good job, batteries still running strong after two months use everyday, good buy for your money.</li>
      <li>I have really been enjoying brushing my teeth and hope that I get a very good report when I go back to the Dentist</li>
      <li>This is important if you have receding gums like I do.</li>
      <li>so far so good.  </li>
      <li>So far is working good.</li>
      <li>Exactly as pictured, I love it.</li>
      <li>My teeth feel clean.  </li>
      <li>It came as a full kit, toothbrush heads,  floss pics and battery to power it.  </li>
      <li>Received quickly.  </li>
      <li>Overall very pleased and would recommend to someone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money.</li>
      <li>This is much better than my old electric rotary toothbrush.</li>
      <li>fun.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not quite as good as Sonicare, but on the other hand, it&#x27;s a quarter of the price.</li>
      <li>Another feature that&#x27;s cool, every 30 seconds it pauses to let you know to switch places in your mouth-a 2 minute cycle for the whole</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work if you don&#x27;t use exactly the right amount of pressure.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s going strong twice a day for over a week so far.  </li>
      <li>I really like that it&#x27;s portable (and waterproof!)</li>
      <li>but it definitely has more power to create sonicator movements.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sorry I tried this product, but I am going to get one that has the type of head I like.</li>
      <li>when I first got it, I&#x27;ve had it for over 6 months</li>
      <li>You have to push and twist the cap and rarely goes on straight.</li>
      <li>First, I cannot stand the sound/sensation when the brush head touches my teeth.</li>
      <li>I only wish there was more choice in the brushes you can get for it.</li>
      <li>and this is the first time they&#x27;ve needed replacing.</li>
      <li>Our dentist recommended it and said it works just as good as the more expensive brand.</li>
      <li>I did&#x27;t want to spend the kind of money the others are asking for their sonic toothbrushes but wanted to give it a go because I was curious about the whole sonic thing.  </li>
      <li>For this price, it seems like a good deal, I will have to come back to describe how long this unit lasts in the &amp;#34;field&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>a nice, handle little toothbrush for my grandson to take off to college with.  </li>
      <li>Price is very competitive.</li>
      <li>Works very well.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never seen this happen before and makes me question what is really going on over at Amazon for them or UPS to alter the records.</li>
      <li>It really does tickle my mouth.  </li>
      <li>very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I hear that brush head replacements are reasonably priced.  </li>
      <li>my brushing experience has really changed</li>
      <li>I just can&#x27;t get too excited over a toothbrush, and I prefer the extra $60 in my pocket to do something</li>
      <li>The batteries seem to be lasting for several weeks since I have been using it and they seem as strong as it was the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>The toothbrush itself is decent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Our advice is to avoid this toothbrush and get a better one, even if it is more expensive.</li>
      <li>Its been a couple of weeks and my teeth feel cleaner already, would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>a high pitched knocking squeal</li>
      <li>We use the high to brush our teeth and the massage to massage the gums after brushing .  </li>
      <li>The sonic action is fairly intense ( not in a bad way), and it feels like you are getting an excellent cleaning.</li>
      <li>This toothbrush works really well, and it is a fraction of the cost of my old electric toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>The brush head is quite small so good for getting at your back molars/gums.  </li>
      <li>The bristles are fine but the back of the head occasionally hits my teeth, and the result is</li>
      <li>We had been using a standard rotational electric toothbrush before, and after it died we switched to an Oral B that both rotates and vibrates and that cleans much better.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Out of the box, this sonic toothbrush pleasantly surprised me.</li>
      <li>I have had it for a couple of months and it is working well so far.</li>
      <li>After 4 months the toothbrush started to fail and we had to replace it, which is in fact a good thing, because this toothbrush does not do its job</li>
      <li>And it makes a mess when I&#x27;m just trying to clean it off after brushing.</li>
      <li>I use it mostly on high sometimes switching to low because it tickles.  </li>
      <li>It has 3 speeds, high, low and pulse mode.  </li>
      <li>They have three speeds- high, low , and massage.  </li>
      <li>But for the price, it&#x27;s worth buying a new one ever few months.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had more expensive brand-name toothbrushes in the past, each of which charged about $10 a head, but I was always able to find generic heads for much cheaper.</li>
      <li>When the proprietary  internal proprietary batteries go (sometimes prematurely) you&#x27;re out of luck, with alkalines you just toss them out and put in new ones in.</li>
      <li>I was looking forward to using this product as a replacement for my Arm &amp; Hammer SpinBrush Pro Clean Sonic Toothbrush which finally died after a few years.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I wanted a sonic toothbrush but refused to take out a mortgage to pay for one. I thought I&#x27;d try this one. While I like electric toothbrushes, and this one is ok, I do have some points I don&#x27;t like. First, I cannot stand the sound/sensation when the brush head touches my teeth. The bristles are fine but the back of the head occasionally hits my teeth, and the result is a high pitched knocking squeal that just about puts me out to pasture. That said, the thing I like the most about this product is that it does not take pressure to clean your teeth well. In fact, if you press hard the brush stops. This is important if you have receding gums like I do. I&#x27;m also pleased that stains on my teeth are disappearing. The only other negative I have is that the brush head is too long for me. I have a small mouth and prefer a round oscillating head. I&#x27;m not sorry I tried this product, but I am going to get one that has the type of head I like.</li>
    <li> Its ok...you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> A very nice way to avoid the dentist...nice product.</li>
    <li> Seems to to be doing a great job at a fraction of the cost ( of a sonicare, for example ).  I really like that it&#x27;s portable (and waterproof!) and I don&#x27;t need yet another charger for something.  Can&#x27;t speak to battery life quite yet but it&#x27;s going strong twice a day for over a week so far.  The brush head is quite small so good for getting at your back molars/gums.  I hear that brush head replacements are reasonably priced.  It comes with just one.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  I only wish there was more choice in the brushes you can get for it.</li>
    <li> It just is not a sonic care</li>
    <li> I did&#x27;t want to spend the kind of money the others are asking for their sonic toothbrushes but wanted to give it a go because I was curious about the whole sonic thing.  It came in a very plain package-looked generic. It came as a full kit, toothbrush heads,  floss pics and battery to power it.  It has 3 speeds, high, low and pulse mode.  I use it mostly on high sometimes switching to low because it tickles.  It really does tickle my mouth.  I know this sounds strange but I can&#x27;t be the only one-lol.  I&#x27;ve had it since Christmas and so far so good.  It looks nice and of good quality.  My teeth feel clean.  The battery is still going strong using twice a day.  Another feature that&#x27;s cool, every 30 seconds it pauses to let you know to switch places in your mouth-a 2 minute cycle for the whole mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A side note;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, the really weird thing is this did not arrive when expected.  This was in no part the fault of the seller but UPS.  It was part of the Christmas on time delivery blunder.  The weird part is on the UPS tracking page and on Amazon itself, it&#x27;s showing as arrived on time when in fact it was 2 days late!  I have a couple of Amazons email with the notification of it&#x27;s delay.  It seems that both UPS and Amazon ALTERED the tracking records!  I&#x27;ve never seen this happen before and makes me question what is really going on over at Amazon for them or UPS to alter the records.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 2 months. I brush my teeth about 3x daily for 2 minutes each time. I&#x27;ve had to change the Energized batteries 3 times. Also, the mechanism for opening and closing the battery compartment is very poorly designed. You have to push and twist the cap and rarely goes on straight.I&#x27;ve had to use pliers to put the cap on. Finally, I decided to toss it because I couldn&#x27;t get the cap back on.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not quite as good as Sonicare, but on the other hand, it&#x27;s a quarter of the price. I just can&#x27;t get too excited over a toothbrush, and I prefer the extra $60 in my pocket to do something fun. It&#x27;s not quite as powerful, and the brush head is a little small, but it does the job. I also actually prefer devices like this one, that use standard alkaline batteries rather than  proprietary rechargeable batteries. When the proprietary  internal proprietary batteries go (sometimes prematurely) you&#x27;re out of luck, with alkalines you just toss them out and put in new ones in. I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush works just fine. Unfortunately it&#x27;s almost impossible to close the battery door, I got it closed once when I first got it, I&#x27;ve had it for over 6 months and this is the first time they&#x27;ve needed replacing. I&#x27;ve worked on it for two days and even took it to my dad, my brother, my uncle, no one can get it to close.</li>
    <li> This product was inexpensive, came with an extra brushhead, batteries, and floss picks. It works almost as well as the electric toothbrushes that cost over 100 dollars. It also arrived within two days of my order.</li>
    <li> sonic toothbrush does a really good job, batteries still running strong after two months use everyday, good buy for your money.</li>
    <li> I have really been enjoying brushing my teeth and hope that I get a very good report when I go back to the Dentist</li>
    <li> I am senior citizen w/arthritis and have to use plyers to open &amp; shut, otherwise I like the toothbrush. Okay</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush! It has awesome power and it uses batteries. It is well priced and a great value.</li>
    <li> So far so good! Its been a couple of weeks and my teeth feel cleaner already, would highly recommend. Price is very competitive.</li>
    <li> Bought two sonics at Christmas. One has constantly been growing the dreaded black mold. Had to buy the sonic seal for $17 bucks to stop it. Later, bought two of these for the price of just the repair for the sonic. Works better and I don&#x27;t have to keep a charger sitting on my counter. Love it. Came with two heads and lots of batteries.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a sonic pulse brush but didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money. This brush is great because it&#x27;s inexpensive and works great. I thought it would just vibrate but it definitely has more power to create sonicator movements.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll spend the extra money next time on a nicer brand name brush. This thing will just stop working in the middle of brushing. And it makes a mess when I&#x27;m just trying to clean it off after brushing.</li>
    <li> a nice, handle little toothbrush for my grandson to take off to college with.  he was very pleased with it.  seems well made and is attractive.</li>
    <li> It won&#x27;t stay on - I replaced the batteries and still had the problem.  Frustrating.  I don&#x27;t recommend this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> this is not as good as Philips sonicare, but for my 4 y.o. is a very good oral hygiene device</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it times it for the 2-minute brushing time, and also every 30 seconds, so that you can alternate sections of the mouth automatically while brushing.  I also liked the price.  I would rather have it rechargeable, rather than having to use batteries that run out.  It would be better for the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it seems to fulfill all the requirements of the much more expensive model.</li>
    <li> It does everything it says and more. Seldom am I impressed with a product. I use it at work and it feels so good to cleanse the mouth out after a spicy or greasy meal.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush itself is decent. That&#x27;s about the best I can say about it. The head bristles are not nearly firm enough. They have about the same firmness as a completely worn out toothbrush (although the head isn&#x27;t frayed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worse, though, is that there&#x27;s no good method for buying replacement heads. I&#x27;ve had more expensive brand-name toothbrushes in the past, each of which charged about $10 a head, but I was always able to find generic heads for much cheaper. This toothbrush, however, has a very specific head shape, so you can&#x27;t just force a different head onto it. Worse, though, the company won&#x27;t sell heads by themselves. In order to buy a head, you have to purchase 6 batteries and 90 floss heads with it.</li>
    <li> I have never had a sonic brush before. This is much better than my old electric rotary toothbrush. Like the fact that it has a two minute timer that stops every thirty second so you can move it to another spot. That is a great idea and works well. I have had it for a couple of months and it is working well so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product twice because of the price but it doesn&#x27;t last long. It works great for a couple of months and is incredibly powerful but it dies out after that. I&#x27;ve changed batteries, cleaned it out, etc, but it still fails. But for the price, it&#x27;s worth buying a new one ever few months.</li>
    <li> We bought this toothbrush attracted by the low price of the replacement heads (it comes with 12). After 4 months the toothbrush started to fail and we had to replace it, which is in fact a good thing, because this toothbrush does not do its job very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my wife and I noticed a decrease in oral hygiene when we started using this toothbrush. We had been using a standard rotational electric toothbrush before, and after it died we switched to an Oral B that both rotates and vibrates and that cleans much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our advice is to avoid this toothbrush and get a better one, even if it is more expensive. The money you might save, you will end up paying it to the dentist.</li>
    <li> Out of the box, this sonic toothbrush pleasantly surprised me. The sonic action is fairly intense ( not in a bad way), and it feels like you are getting an excellent cleaning. There 3 speeds, and a timer going off every 30 sec for each quadrant. The unit shuts off after 2 minutes. The unit appears sturdy and well made ( considering origin of manufacture and cost). For this price, it seems like a good deal, I will have to come back to describe how long this unit lasts in the &amp;#34;field&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I bought the sonic toothbrush as a gift  For my husband. He cannot stop  telling me how amazing it it. Now I am getting myself one.</li>
    <li> The tooth brushes arrived in the promised time frame.  The tooth brushes work great. They have three speeds- high, low , and massage.  We use the high to brush our teeth and the massage to massage the gums after brushing .  The tooth brush is timed at 2 minutes for brushing and 2 minutes for massage.  The brush has a brief pause to let you know when to move the brush to another side.  Our dentist recommended it and said it works just as good as the more expensive brand.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to using this product as a replacement for my Arm &amp; Hammer SpinBrush Pro Clean Sonic Toothbrush which finally died after a few years. Unfortunately, I got no further than opening the box and looking at the product. Why? The battery cover was impossible to remove. It was properly turned to the &amp;#34;Open&amp;#34; position - and there it remained. No matter what I tried that cover would not budge. So it was returned and I shall seek another replacement elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel and it works well enough.</li>
    <li> We purchased these to travel with. It works better than the electronic one I have at home. Plan to buy more for stocking stuffers.</li>
    <li> So far is working good.</li>
    <li> I hate this product and can not believe there are no replacement heads avail. what a colosal waste of money</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for - piece of you-know-what - falling apart and didn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> Directions for removing battery cover not very clear, on-off button very sensitive turns on a half second before getting toothbrush in my mouth</li>
    <li> The toothbrush was just what I wanted. It&#x27;s a great size, easy to handle. The cost was the best part! I would recommend it and if fact am going to buy another for the family.</li>
    <li> Just got this today and it came with 3 set of battery&#x27;s and a bunch of floss sticks and a extra head ! I wasn&#x27;t expecting all that for the price I got ! I&#x27;m buying more for my roommate</li>
    <li> This toothbrush works really well, and it is a fraction of the cost of my old electric toothbrush.  It also came with an extra brush head.</li>
    <li> It has been a great toothbrush so far.  I would recommend it!  The batteries seem to be lasting for several weeks since I have been using it and they seem as strong as it was the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> what a great  toothbrush and great price!!!!  I so glad i got this toothbrush my brushing experience has really changed</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work if you don&#x27;t use exactly the right amount of pressure.If you push too hard it needs less, if you don&#x27;t push hard enough it doesn&#x27;t clean.</li>
    <li> Received quickly.  I ordered electric toothbrush.  I received a battery operated one.  Returned for refund.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush for the price</li>
    <li> I have an Oral B electric toothbrush that I loved but am going to travel so wanted something that would travel easily.  This is a Solid feeling brush.  BUT Brand new batteries and extremely weak.  Returning it and do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured, I love it.</li>
    <li> Works well. Batteries last a long time. 30sec time is MUST! Overall very pleased and would recommend to someone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money. Took a few weeks to get used to vibrations vs. manual brushing. I have now used almost 2months and still on original batteries I put in and working great.</li>
