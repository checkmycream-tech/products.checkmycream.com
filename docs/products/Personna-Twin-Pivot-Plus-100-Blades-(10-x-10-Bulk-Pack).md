      <li>I use these with my head blade eclipse and it works great for a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>you save more when buying more</li>
      <li>Really good quality at a very reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>Bought these for my fianc&amp;eacute;, great price, so far he says they work just like they should.</li>
      <li>Great to find these for my husband at a great price as a substitute for Gillette Atra Plus, which are getting hard to find.</li>
      <li>They work just fine.</li>
      <li>My friend is super pleased with these - hope</li>
      <li>They fit my razor fine...</li>
      <li>and i have a light beard.  </li>
      <li>They work great and will last me a life.</li>
      <li>Just as good or even better than the &amp;#34;Brand Name&amp;#34; blades available at the big drug stores but</li>
      <li>I know they are cheaply price...</li>
      <li>They arrived in a few days &amp; they work perfectly -</li>
      <li>Even though I have a medium type beard &amp; shave daily, I don&#x27;t feel that I get a good, smooth shave with these.</li>
      <li>It is nice to have these available for the old razor.  </li>
      <li>But beats the hell out of paying full price.</li>
      <li>and it still shaves adequately.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used 5 blades so far &amp; don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using any more.</li>
      <li>Stubborness, I guess; I love the feel of the old Atra handle.</li>
      <li>I wish I knew why the Personna blades don&#x27;t feel right, whether it&#x27;s sharpness, coating, straightness or what.</li>
      <li>Blade cartridge heads are slightly larger than original but work just fine.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I ordered, delivered in record time.</li>
      <li>They work fine and last an adequate amount of time before dulling out.</li>
      <li>Yap, some times they cut you the first time, you use it.</li>
      <li>I bought three sets of these so far for my elderly friend; he loves them and can&#x27;t believe how cheap they are.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>Been using them for several months and after years of watching razor blade prices soar, these economical blades really do fit the bill...</li>
      <li>Not to mention that if you prefer the Atra razor twin blade, then you also know that these blades are not an easy find at your local retail store.  </li>
      <li>Then they are fine the second time.</li>
      <li>hold an edge for a decent time and so far I have found no bad or defective blades....</li>
      <li>I know you find it hard to believe that they are any good...</li>
      <li>So much cheaper to buy this way.</li>
      <li>They give me a smooth,close comfortable shave, plus you get 100 blades at a low price.</li>
      <li>fast shipping..recommend</li>
      <li>The Wilkinson, non-pivoting blades give a shave that is just below the Atra with high quality blades.</li>
      <li>I can use a new blade every time.</li>
      <li>If you buy personna twin blades with the lube strip these are exactly the same.</li>
      <li>While not the quality of the original Atra razor blades in that they don&#x27;t seem to last as long, they are still a bargain price and get the job done with comfort.  </li>
      <li>And if you do find them locally they are far from being a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>He uses them to &amp;#34;dry shave&amp;#34; (old school?)</li>
      <li>Bottom line - decent performance and VERY low cost</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected and what I had been paying $16.95+tax at Walgreens for 10.</li>
      <li>Plus, they are getting hard to fine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be back ... but not for nearly 2 years.  </li>
      <li>Very sharp blades and priced very afford-ably.  </li>

<li> I hold on to things for a long time.  </li>
<li> The only differences are that it cost alot less and doesn&#x27;t have a personna sticker on them.</li>
<li> So I spent about the same and got 200 less blades.  </li>
<li> Just as I expected.  </li>
<li> They arrived faster than I expected, too.</li>
<li> These blades will last me 4.93 years at a cost of a little less than a nickle a shave.</li>
<li> Just as sharp as the 5 blade cartridges which would probably cost hundreds of dollars for this quantity.</li>
<li> The packaging does not look like the one of the ad, it&#x27;s actually 10 little plastic holders with 10 blades each in them just like the ones you buy at the store.</li>
<li> That stinks, but its still a decent deal.</li>
<li> Dull blades had to buy others.</li>
<li> tough to get one shave per blade</li>
<li> These are so dull they are painful to shave with.  </li>
<li> Because these blades are so expensive in stores, I bought these as an experiment to use in my Atra handle.</li>
<li> Say goodbye to those expensive 5 blade models.</li>
<li> Too bad</li>
<li> The worst blades i&#x27;ve ever owned in 65 years of shaving.  </li>

    <li> Delivery on time ( as always ) a great deal for the price !</li>
    <li> These are the same razor blades I have used for years.  I use them to shave both  my head and face daily.  These blades are a bargain at twice the price!</li>
    <li> These work as well as Atra blades at 1/20th the price!</li>
    <li> Absolutely WONDERFUL!  No problems with these blades at all.  At the price difference, I could change blades every day and still save loads of money over locally purchased blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be back ... but not for nearly 2 years.  What a bargain!</li>
    <li> Great to find these for my husband at a great price as a substitute for Gillette Atra Plus, which are getting hard to find.</li>
    <li> Because these blades are so expensive in stores, I bought these as an experiment to use in my Atra handle. I&#x27;ve used 5 blades so far &amp; don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using any more. Even though I have a medium type beard &amp; shave daily, I don&#x27;t feel that I get a good, smooth shave with these. I use some disposables that don&#x27;t pivot but use Wilkinson blades as comparison. The Wilkinson, non-pivoting blades give a shave that is just below the Atra with high quality blades. Why not use the disposables? Stubborness, I guess; I love the feel of the old Atra handle. I wish I knew why the Personna blades don&#x27;t feel right, whether it&#x27;s sharpness, coating, straightness or what. I do know I won&#x27;t  buy them again. My search for good, fairly  priced Atra blades continues...</li>
    <li> I have my doubts about whether this is actually manufactured by Personna because the design is somewhat different than my Atra blades and the &amp;#34;lubri-strip&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;lube&amp;#34;.  I think the strip is strictly there to mimic the Atra blades.  That being said, I&#x27;ve been using the same blade for over 3 weeks and it still shaves adequately.  Bottom line - decent performance and VERY low cost so I&#x27;d purchase again</li>
    <li> The blades were shipped as promised and were above expectations.</li>
    <li> A good blade at a great price.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Wonderful price!</li>
    <li> The worst blades i&#x27;ve ever owned in 65 years of shaving.  tough to get one shave per blade and i have a light beard.  Must have been made from shipbreaker steel.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered, delivered in record time. They work great and will last me a life. Say goodbye to those expensive 5 blade models.</li>
    <li> Meets manufacturer specifications $18 for 100 or $18 for 10 from item manufacturer (Gillette).</li>
    <li> They arrived in a few days &amp; they work perfectly - I&#x27;m getting 8-10 shaves on 1 blade - Great purchase</li>
    <li> Just as I expected.  No pricey blades for my husband as he has the same luck with these!</li>
    <li> Dull blades had to buy others.</li>
    <li> you save more when buying more</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT!!!!!!!  WILL PURCHASE AGAIN.  JOEL COHEN</li>
    <li> Excellent- Great to do business with.</li>
    <li> Great deal for Trac II razors, and so far, good quality.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality! Works great!</li>
    <li> I bought three sets of these so far for my elderly friend; he loves them and can&#x27;t believe how cheap they are. He uses them to &amp;#34;dry shave&amp;#34; (old school?) but that is his thing. If I used a manual shaver, I would use these. My friend is super pleased with these - hope they don&#x27;t stop making them.  I recommend them; can&#x27;t beat the price!!!!</li>
    <li> Great price for the requested item.  They work just fine.</li>
    <li> So much cheaper to buy this way. And there is no difference in the quality.</li>
    <li> Incredible value and great blades. Shipped on time and very happy with purchase. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy these razor blades!</li>
    <li> I really loved these Personna twin pivot plus blades. They give me a smooth,close comfortable shave, plus you get 100 blades at a low price. Can&#x27;t beat that. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Purchased it once before and was very satisfied so I purchased them again.</li>
    <li> Just like the ones I used to buy at the local drug store!  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> great item fast shipping wonderful engineering</li>
    <li> Blade cartridge heads are slightly larger than original but work just fine.</li>
    <li> These are so dull they are painful to shave with.  They just pull out your whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used 2 of them, and I&#x27;m throwing the rest away.</li>
    <li> What can I say....I hold on to things for a long time.  It is nice to have these available for the old razor.  They work fine and last an adequate amount of time before dulling out.</li>
    <li> While not the quality of the original Atra razor blades in that they don&#x27;t seem to last as long, they are still a bargain price and get the job done with comfort.  Not to mention that if you prefer the Atra razor twin blade, then you also know that these blades are not an easy find at your local retail store.  And if you do find them locally they are far from being a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Very sharp blades and priced very afford-ably.  Just as sharp as the 5 blade cartridges which would probably cost hundreds of dollars for this quantity.</li>
    <li> 10c per blade. Heck yeah. I can use a new blade every time.</li>
    <li> Great value and a good shave. One of my best purchases this year!</li>
    <li> I ordered 200 (2 x 100 pack) of these along with the &amp;#34;All Metal Heavyweight Chrome ATRA Compatible Twin Blade Razor&amp;#34; on June 6, 2015. These blades will last me 4.93 years at a cost of a little less than a nickle a shave.</li>
    <li> Yap, some times they cut you the first time, you use it. Then they are fine the second time. But beats the hell out of paying full price. Plus, they are getting hard to fine.</li>
    <li> I know they are cheaply price...I know you find it hard to believe that they are any good...BUT...they are!!!!  Been using them for several months and after years of watching razor blade prices soar, these economical blades really do fit the bill...They fit my razor fine...hold an edge for a decent time and so far I have found no bad or defective blades....Medium Coarse Beard....same shave as Schick.....</li>
    <li> If you buy personna twin blades with the lube strip these are exactly the same. No difference at all. I bought a package of personna blades to compare. The packaging does not look like the one of the ad, it&#x27;s actually 10 little plastic holders with 10 blades each in them just like the ones you buy at the store. The only differences are that it cost alot less and doesn&#x27;t have a personna sticker on them.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected and what I had been paying $16.95+tax at Walgreens for 10.</li>
    <li> Really good quality at a very reasonable price.  Too bad I was trying to order 2 of the 250 packs and somehow messed up and got 3 of the 100 packs.  Guess the cart didn&#x27;t update correctly when I changed the item and quantity.  So I spent about the same and got 200 less blades.  That stinks, but its still a decent deal.</li>
    <li> Just as good or even better than the &amp;#34;Brand Name&amp;#34; blades available at the big drug stores but these are a super-value at this price!&lt;br /&gt;Thinking of buying more so that I can avoid any probable price increase!</li>
    <li> Bought these for my fianc&amp;eacute;, great price, so far he says they work just like they should. They arrived faster than I expected, too.</li>
    <li> Excellent item was as described..fast shipping..recommend</li>
    <li> I use these with my head blade eclipse and it works great for a reasonable price.</li>
