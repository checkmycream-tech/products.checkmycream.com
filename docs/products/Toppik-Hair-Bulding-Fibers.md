      <li>I am incredibly satisfied and would do it again in a heartbeat.      </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s all it does is sit on top of your hair.</li>
      <li>I even went to the gym that day and most of it stayed in place even with sweat.  </li>
      <li>It just looked like magic.  </li>

      <li>One more I made up.  </li>
      <li>I am able to hide my scalp and I am no longer embarrassed.</li>

      <li>For $21.00 each I could have invited a couple of friends and had a good time at my fav bar and would have been much happier than I am with this product!</li>

      <li>and my hair is becoming thinner.  </li>
      <li>Looks like I have a full head of hair again!  </li>

      <li>Easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a woman over 50 and my hair has been thinning on the top of my head (sound familiar?).  </li>
      <li>I was constantly receiving compliments on how beautiful it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I feel so much more confident knowing that the back of my head has no \\&quot;see through\\&quot; bits in bright light.</li>
      <li>Anyway, if that happens I sprinkle another dusting on and it looks fine.</li>
      <li>but I spritz it with a fine mist of holding spray and have never EVER seen any on my pillow or clothing.</li>
      <li>It was a huge source of my self confidence.</li>
      <li>and I used this product happily for about 6 months after my second plastic surgery.  </li>
      <li>Toppik is fantastic.</li>
      <li>Light brown.</li>
      <li>I used to use this product all the time, and it&#x27;s deffinitely not bad, but this new one I am using seems much more effective both in volumizing and in bonding to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Check</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty easy to spot by looking in the mirror -- and people around you will notice it in good or decent lighting.  </li>
      <li>I get compliments all the time about how nice my \\&quot;new hairdo is.\\</li>
      <li>so you will need to clean up after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I now have a full head of hair and intend to do a video review with before and after pics.      </li>
      <li>When I first started, I&#x27;d get it in my face, leave some in the shower or on the pillow, but that changed (very quickly) with experience.  </li>
      <li>and I apply it quickly after I&#x27;m done.</li>
      <li>I have only been using this stuff for a short while but am really impressed with the results.</li>
      <li>or it will end up falling off of your hair and your cover will be blown, but once you get it down, man oh man will you be happy.        </li>
      <li>Like with any new product, you get better at using it.    </li>
      <li>it out people, \\&quot;Hairfor2 Hair thickener\\&quot; is far better from my experience with it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used my own brand of hairspray.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Toppik for a year and have had nothing but good experience with it -- it has never once rubbed off on my pillow case and even if it did, it is easily washable -- a small price to pay for not looking hair-challenged.</li>
      <li>No, it&#x27;s not as good as having your own thick hair (as I had, when young), but it works amazingly well to cover up the bare scalp.  </li>
      <li>Also I make certain that my hair is squeaky clean before use.</li>
      <li>ever right ha ha), anyways-I have looked into rogaine and</li>
      <li>I tried using eyebrow pencil at my part, but it never looked quite right.  </li>
      <li>Avodart works many times better and costs significantly less.  </li>
      <li>Also, the fibers are so fine and light that the faintest movement of air will blow them away during application -- you need to hold the can right next to your hair to avoid that.  </li>
      <li>&quot; It&#x27;s incredibly easy to apply and within seconds, literally, my hair looks like a 25 year old girl&#x27;s hair should</li>
      <li>I will ever have my thick beautiful hair back, but at least I can walk out the door and look people in the eye feeling confident that I am still beautiful.</li>
      <li>First time I used Toppik</li>
      <li>I tried most all of the hair regrowth products only to later discover most of them were a scam and resulted in me losing more hair when there are actually only a couple things that do work.        </li>
      <li>After surviving cancer and having a hysterectomy last year, I noticed that my hair was dramatically thinning on top.</li>
      <li>I will never forget the way it made me feel the first time I used it, my problems of hair loss and insecurities were gone.</li>
      <li>it really works!</li>
      <li>I was devastated and embarrassed that my scalp was starting to become more visible.</li>
      <li>I wish the fibers were a bit larger -- perhaps that would make it work better.  </li>
      <li>I really sympathize with everyone losing their hair so please please please, take the time to read my review and thank me in a couple of years!      </li>
      <li>Even if it was, the good that this product does far out weighs the minor issues that could occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have found in general that they are a waste of time, but I specifically made time to write this response because Toppik honestly, truly, and sincerely changed my life.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The idea&#x27;s great.  And I still use it -- sparringly and seldom.  The biggest issue is that the end result looks more like fur or fuzz rather than hair.  It&#x27;s pretty easy to spot by looking in the mirror -- and people around you will notice it in good or decent lighting.  Perhaps it&#x27;s because my hair is not just a little thin -- the thinning, especially upfront is significant.      I think if your hair is just beginning to thin, it&#x27;s a good solution -- it will create a dark background for your remaining hair, and will probably be hard to detect.  If your hair is significantly thin like mine, you will be disappointed with the results.  Also, the fibers are so fine and light that the faintest movement of air will blow them away during application -- you need to hold the can right next to your hair to avoid that.  And it doesn&#x27;e seem to \\&quot;stick\\&quot; to my remaining hair.  It seems to fall through and stick to my scalp, probably because there are plenty of tiny vellus hairs there still.  Also (and probably for the same reason), I always end up with a lot of the fibers in front of my hairline, and it just looks like dark dust.  Trying to brush it off with a towel or a hand creates clumps that have to then be carefully and tediously brushed away.    I wish the fibers were a bit larger -- perhaps that would make it work better.  But if I am going out at night and the lighting is poor, it works fairly well in reducing the appearance of baldness.</li>
    <li> I used the black variety, a few days after I used it I noticed a strange blue-black colour in my nasal mucous . The strange colour disappeared after a week of discontinued use. The active ingredient is probably carcinogen. I reported  the adverse reaction on the FDA form. I don&#x27;t expect any action from the Agency as this agency is grossly inefficient  and is paid off under the table. Good luck, you&#x27;re on your own in this beautiful country of the U.S. of A.[[ASIN:B0013U235Q Toppik Hair Building Fiber Dark Brown]]</li>
    <li> I am over 60, and have baby fine brown hair and a very white scalp.  I tried using eyebrow pencil at my part, but it never looked quite right.  I have found that this works really well to hide my thin spots and make my hair look thicker! I bought dark brown but it seems just a little too dark, so next time, I may try a shade lighter.</li>
    <li> I really sympathize with everyone losing their hair so please please please, take the time to read my review and thank me in a couple of years!      About me:    I am currently a 28 y/o male and I used this product happily for about 6 months after my second plastic surgery.  I wish I had discovered it years ago, but at least I did.  I started losing my hair in my early 20&#x27;s or late teens but didn&#x27;t realize it until I was 23 or 24.  Typically you don&#x27;t notice hair loss until you&#x27;ve lost at least 50% of it!  Anyway, I was devastated.  I used to model and was very popular amongst the girls.  I tried most all of the hair regrowth products only to later discover most of them were a scam and resulted in me losing more hair when there are actually only a couple things that do work.        About Toppik:    This is NOT a product that will help regrow your hair, but simply mask your thinning hair.  This will work well for both females and males.  Probably better for females since the more hair you have left, the better it works, so don&#x27;t cut your hair short or you will look silly!  Gently shake it over your head like a salt shaker.  Careful not to apply too much or it will end up falling off of your hair and your cover will be blown, but once you get it down, man oh man will you be happy.        When I used it:    I typically used this product when I would go out anywhere where I didn&#x27;t have to worry about it getting wet.  I would use courve in those situations.  Don&#x27;t run your hands through your hair or let girls play with it a lot since the powder can get on hands.       What really works for hair regrowth:    PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE read this.      As I mentioned, I tried everything, even the things that were almost obviously scams.  I now have a full head of hair and intend to do a video review with before and after pics.      Avodart is the only medicine I would recommend.  There is procerin and finasteride which are small and incredibly expensive prescriptions that do work, but the dosage is much too small if you do the research.  Avodart works many times better and costs significantly less.  I order mind from Canada Drugs at a fraction of American prices.  This is also only available through prescription.  See, I am not endorsing a product I will profit from!  The dosage is only available in 0.5 mg pills, even though research shows 2.5 mg is the ideal dosage for hair loss.  This drug is typically used to keep your prostate small (bonus!!!) so you will probably have to explain to your doctor why you are requesting this drug.      The over the counter topical drugs have shown to work, but only at the crown of the head and the amount of regrowth is hardly worth the oily scalp and other side effects.    Now... the other treatment I have undergone is actually plastic surgery.  I have had two hair transplants costing me a little over $10,000 total.  I am incredibly satisfied and would do it again in a heartbeat.      Please don&#x27;t get scammed.  The sooner you get on Avodart the sooner you can start regrowing your hair.  It can only recover up the the amount of hair you have lost in the past 5 years or less so seriously, it&#x27;s not something you can wait on if you are serious about keeping your hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Toppik for a year and have had nothing but good experience with it -- it has never once rubbed off on my pillow case and even if it did, it is easily washable -- a small price to pay for not looking hair-challenged. It is very good at binding with your hair and giving it a fuller look.  Try it!</li>
    <li> Hi   About 2 months ago I bought the Toppik shampoo, the conditioner and the shake-on hair fibers. I am ordering more shampoo and conditioner for me and now for my daughter, who inherited my thin hair...  But the really good thing is the shake-on fibers... sometimes the fibres can look a little spotty on the scalp  - not sure yet why that is - some kind of electric charge maybe or perhaps too soon after washing hair? Anyway, if that happens I sprinkle another dusting on and it looks fine. I only need to do a couple of shakes a day, so I think it will last for a long time. I am careful not to touch my hair at the front or it will start to look clumpy and obvious. But it really does help a lot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman over 50 and my hair has been thinning on the top of my head (sound familiar?).  I accidentally found this product online while searching for something just to hide that white scalp area that shows through so badly.  I tried Toppik and I tried a make-up type product sold for the same purpose.  The make-up was hard to apply and I didn&#x27;t like the way it worked for me, but when I sprinkled on the Toppik, I couldn&#x27;t believe the result.  This is truely, the best solution out there for thinning hair problems.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for almost 4 years and still marvel at the results.    Someday, maybe a hair transplant will be in order, but until that time, this product gets me through day to day.  It doesn&#x27;t grow hair, it doesn&#x27;t stop thinning, it&#x27;s not a medical product ... it simply hides the scalp in a very easy to use, natural looking way.  No one knows there is anything on my hair ... ever.    The person who had it going all over her face and had it all over her pillow used too much.  When I first started, I&#x27;d get it in my face, leave some in the shower or on the pillow, but that changed (very quickly) with experience.  Like with any new product, you get better at using it.    The company also sells a little atomizer spray attachment that I purchased early on.  That works great for keeping the amount used in check and for directing the fibers to exactly where you want them to go.    I&#x27;ve never used the spray that they sell to keep the fibers in place.  I&#x27;ve only used my own brand of hairspray.  I&#x27;ve also never tried any of their other products.  Just the Toppik itself, and the atomizer attachment, so I can&#x27;t comment on their other products.    If your hair is thinning and you&#x27;re having trouble styling it in a way that doesn&#x27;t call attention to your bald spots, you owe it to yourself to try this product.  Use it as directed and you&#x27;ll be very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband who is losing his hair.This product works exceptionally well to add an appearance of thickness, fullness and more hair. I first purchased this in the travel size to try it and it worked so well that I wanted to make it last as long as possible. I am not a rocket scientist but it seems that the static charge of your hair can only hold so much and all else will fall out but I spritz it with a fine mist of holding spray and have never EVER seen any on my pillow or clothing. Also I make certain that my hair is squeaky clean before use. I think it is an amazing product.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist introduced me to this product about a year ago and I am absolutely hooked.  I have recommended it to so many women with thinning hair.  It is absolutely remarkable.  Now my husband is using it.  It looks completely natural and it only takes 1 minute to apply.  This is my all time favorite beauty secret. I&#x27;d rather forget my make up than my Toppik.</li>
    <li> Even when using the sprayer accessory, these fibers do NOT stay where you put them. I tried using it to cover up thinning hair along my front hairline and would have dark dust on my fingers after touchng my forehead - this product makes you look like there is chimney dust falling from your hair. If it would stay in place, I think it would be a decent cover-up. The claims of it not coming off when it gets wet seem incredibly false to me - all you have to do is shake your head and they will sprinkle down onto your face. Also, it looks &#x27;fake&#x27; when under direct light.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this stuff for a short while but am really impressed with the results. I have only very minimal-moderate hair loss and thinning in the crown and temples. A few sprinkiles of this and it&#x27;s gone. I feel so much more confident knowing that the back of my head has no \\&quot;see through\\&quot; bits in bright light. It was making me feel really self-conscious. Gone now. :)</li>
    <li> I started using Toppik 3 years ago, I am now 23.  Being so young and dealing with thinning hair has had a major impact on my self confidence, but I have been dealing with this my whole life (medical problems/over dyeing and bleaching).  I think the best thing I have done for myself was to admit that a product like this would help.  First time I used Toppik I was so happy (used it right when I got in my car after buying), I loved how it worked. It was my hair but with a little help.  I have had sew ins, clips in, and wigs, but being able to wear my own hair with confidence changed everything.  I did learn that using the setting spray is a must or just hair spray usually works for me.  It has become a staple in my make up bag.</li>
    <li> You know, I have to admit that I had given up on hair loss products, just because my hair was falling out like crazy. But once I tried Toppik I was really amazed by the results. even if is just to conceal it. still pretty darn good.</li>
    <li> I have been using toppik since Sept 2006. I will never forget the way it made me feel the first time I used it, my problems of hair loss and insecurities were gone. I having thinning hair around the crown and this product works for me. I even got a haircut with it on and my hairdresser had no idea. The only thing is that it does mess up your bathroom with the sprinkles. I tried dermatch and that product sucked. Toppik I cannot live with out. No one has EVER said anything to me they don&#x27;t know I wear it and they think my hair is thick. I would recommend this product who has thinning hair and your scalp is showing.</li>
    <li> I have had thin hair for a few years now and have tried many different products in attempt to make my hair fuller. When I was pregnant I started taking prenatal vitamins and my hair looked wonderful. After having my daughter I noticed my hair was starting to shed. Though I have had thin hair I never experienced shedding like this! I was devastated and embarrassed that my scalp was starting to become more visible. I started searching for a long term and quick fix for my hair. I found amazing vitamins and started taking them and then I found Toppik. It is easy to use, slightly messy but worth it in the end. I am able to hide my scalp and I am no longer embarrassed. I wish I could post a picture of before and after. There is a great difference without looking fake or odd!</li>
    <li> I used to use this product all the time, and it&#x27;s deffinitely not bad, but this new one I am using seems much more effective both in volumizing and in bonding to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Check it out people, \\&quot;Hairfor2 Hair thickener\\&quot; is far better from my experience with it.&lt;br /&gt;I buy it off amazon.ca</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and have started to notice thinning at the top of my head.  This was extremely devastating for me.  I began to look for solutions and searched the internet for help!  I was fortunate enough to learn about Toppik.  It is a lifesaver for me.  It works perfectly on my thinning areas.  My hair looks natural and full.  There is NO sign of product in my hair.  It is easy to apply, you merely shake the fibers onto the thinning areas and within seconds, there are no thinning areas.  It is like magic.  This has to be one of the greatest products ever made...truly has impacted my life in a good way.  I have not experience any problems with applying Toppik and it isn&#x27;t on my pillow when I wake.  Even if it was, the good that this product does far out weighs the minor issues that could occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone who is experiencing hair loss or thinning....it really works!</li>
    <li> I am a black  woman over 50 and yes my hair is thinning.  Because I use oils on my hair I didn&#x27;t think that the product would work.  I have been using it for five months now and I am very happy.  I dont use the spray.</li>
    <li> Got this From AMSG enterprises on amazon, and man, what a dissappointment.     It looks like you have a coat of spray paint or dust on your head. I could see if you are thinning, and your scalp doesnt show, it may work, but if your scalp shows at all, this stuff does not work. Unlike the claim of being undetectable, can see this from 10+ feet away.</li>
    <li> Dont waste your money on this,  In the Light it looks as if you put dirt in your hair, you can see it.  :(</li>
    <li> I love this product, thank you Toppik!  So convenient to use and it stays on whole day.  No mess at all.  You open the container, check the area where the hair is thinning and then tap the container on the spot little by little so fiber comes out and covers it naturally.  Easy to use.  No smell at all as others mentioned.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t begin to sing the praises of this product enough! I&#x27;ve always had very thick, dark hair and so much hair, in fact, that I often had to have it \\&quot;thinned out\\&quot; when I went to the salon. After surviving cancer and having a hysterectomy last year, I noticed that my hair was dramatically thinning on top. Having dark, thick hair - my hair loss became so noticable, especially against my (pale) scalp. This side effect of my illness and took a devastating toll on my self esteem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never heard of Toppik before but I accidentally \\&quot;stumbled\\&quot; upon it, as I was reading (less than positive) reviews for another, \\&quot;spray\\&quot; product, meant to combat the same problem. Then I went to the Toppik website and was shocked to see how many positive reviews this product had. Despite all the positive reviews, I really didn&#x27;t think it would work for me as well as it had for everyone else who had posted their reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a few days I had a small bottle of Toppik in my hand and decided to give it a try. After a few shakes of the product, I stood looking at my scalp in the mirror, in complete disbelief. It worked! In fact, I&#x27;m going to say that it worked miracles!! It made the wide, pale patches on the top of my hair completely disappear in seconds. I shook my head and the fibers didn&#x27;t fly off. I ran my fingers through my hair and it didn&#x27;t rub off on my fingers or fly off in the sink. The real test came when I went to bed that night with the product in my hair, and the product was still in my hair (and not on my all white bedding!) when I woke up the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is easy to use, can be applied in seconds and is one of the most effective products for thinning hair/hair loss I&#x27;ve ever used. I can now go out in public without feeling self-conscious about my hair loss. Wonderful.. and yes, life changing.</li>
    <li> I am a 25 year old female and was told about 2 years ago that I might have slight PCOS. Unfortunately, one of the side effects of this syndrome is hair loss. I had been on birth control throughout college and when I stopped taking it, my hair thinned a lot. It was incredibly embarrassing and emotional for me, because I had no idea why it was happening. The worst part is that when I was a little girl, my hair was insanely thick. It was a huge source of my self confidence. I was constantly receiving compliments on how beautiful it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I lived for a year before my dermatologist told me about Toppik. I want all of the readers to know that I have never in my life written a product review. I have found in general that they are a waste of time, but I specifically made time to write this response because Toppik honestly, truly, and sincerely changed my life. My hair has not gotten any thicker since its initial thinning but with Toppik it looks absolutely amazing. I get compliments all the time about how nice my \\&quot;new hairdo is.\\&quot; It&#x27;s incredibly easy to apply and within seconds, literally, my hair looks like a 25 year old girl&#x27;s hair should look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a little bit pricey, but for me it is absolutely worth it. I am more confident now than I have been in years. 1 bottle of this product generally lasts me about a month, so on average I spend about $250.00 per year on Toppik. The only bad thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t last through water, and I love to swim in the summer. Generally I just bring the bottle with me if I know I&#x27;ll be swimming and I apply it quickly after I&#x27;m done. I would highly recommend the Toppik Hairspray, as it binds to the microfibers and holds them in place. Another suggestion I have is to apply Toppik in your bathroom. The fibers are teeny tiny and they get everywhere so you will need to clean up after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toppik looks REAL. I swear it does. My friends and family genuinely thought that my hair had grown back. I even had my best friend put her face 1 inch away from my head to show her the Toppik fibers and she couldn&#x27;t find them. She didn&#x27;t believe me and truly thought that the hair was real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously losing your hair at any age is traumatic for a woman especially, but when you are a young woman it can be very damaging to your self esteem. I hope that there are some young women out there who are reading this because I know how it feels to think that you are abnormal. I don&#x27;t want to sound cheesy, but to those women out there with PCOS or female pattern baldness or alopecia...I understand how you feel and the best advice that I can give is to forget about it. There is nothing that we can do to really reverse this problem, but we can accept it and try to improve our situation. That is what Toppik has helped me do. I realize that it is very unlikely I will ever have my thick beautiful hair back, but at least I can walk out the door and look people in the eye feeling confident that I am still beautiful. My hair isn&#x27;t thick, but with Toppik I just look like a normal girl with normal amount of hair, and that is all I can ask for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sincerely thank the people who created this amazing product.</li>
    <li> I received my Toppik product yesterday, just 4 days after I ordered it vis Amazon.com, which is very impressive considering I was having it shipped to Sydney, Australia.    The product caused much hilarity when a workmate applied it at lunchtime and suddenly my bald head began to sprout thick, natural looking hair.     I have tried sprays before and they were messy, ran and were unconvincing. Toppik is different. Today I took my time to apply the product and used the plastic insert cut out of a baseball cap to shape my front hairline. The result-fantastic. The girl at the liquor store actually engaged me in a long conversation when I fronted up with my new hair tonight. Shallow? Yes. Do I care if she&#x27;s shallow? No. Toppik makes me look 10 years younger and I can&#x27;t wait to test it out in social situations.    Toppik is fantastic. I&#x27;d recommend to add hairspray to seal it in though, especially if you have a short haircut and severe baldness s I do. No more &#x27;owls eyes&#x27;, I have a natural looking hairline again! Absolutely amazing!</li>
    <li> I am a 60+ year old woman with one main area on the top of my head toward the back that shows scalp.  Toppik is like a miracle to me.  No, it&#x27;s not as good as having your own thick hair (as I had, when young), but it works amazingly well to cover up the bare scalp.  This is absolutely not a scam.  However, to avoid embarrasment (having it come off down your neck or come off on someone&#x27;s hand or on a pillow) you MUST:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Keep your head down for a full 2 minutes after applying&lt;br /&gt;2.  Pat your head gently a few times in the area of application after the 2 minutes&lt;br /&gt;3.  Comb it through once or twice after the 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These instructions come with the product and MUST be followed. One more I made up.  Lift your hair up and wash the neck area and the back area in case some of the product came down and gives the appearance of dirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really simple: the whole operation takes 3 minutes and you can go out and not worry about looking bald.</li>
    <li> Just bought it . Light brown. I like it..its not messy. Easy to apply.  use a shade lighter than your own hair.</li>
    <li> Just start using this product, and it works! I am so happy finding the Toppik, and I recommend it to everybody try it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 31 years old and I&#x27;m sadly receding and my hair is becoming thinner.  I hate it so much because it feels like my youth is being taken away.  The good reviews on here are wrong.  It really looked like I had build up of dust on my head.  You could see my scalp covered with this dust.  It looked awful.  The worst part is I did it at work and I took it off with water and it smeared off.  I looked ridiculous.  I feel stupid and I have lost more hope.  This product is $24.99 and it should be banned for sale because of false advertising.  Don&#x27;t believe the videos they show.  If your really curious just try it.  It&#x27;s not worth the time and money.  You&#x27;ll feel stupid in the end for falling for this SCAM.  I&#x27;m getting my money back by returning it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews on Amazon, but I had to say a couple things about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a not even 30 and started to have thinning hair in the frontal area (worse thing ever right ha ha), anyways-I have looked into rogaine and what not-but stumbled upon this product on a YouTube ad actually.  It just looked like magic.  I was definitely skeptical because it basically looked like a 1-3 minute process... and what do you know-it actually is that quick and simple.  I received the product very fast like in 1-2 days, put on the product and was definitely content with the results.  Of course you need some hair to keep the balance of the product in, but once its on it is remarkable.  Looks like I have a full head of hair again!  I even went to the gym that day and most of it stayed in place even with sweat.  Just don&#x27;t run your hands vigorously through or I assume it will come out eventually.  With all the science in the world you think they would have solved the problem of hair loss... anyways for the time being, this will do.  I recommend this product all the way!</li>
    <li> **WARNING** **WARNING** **WARNING** This product????? It does not deserve a \\&quot;ONE\\&quot;....I would definitely give it a ZERO if it was allowable!&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is TERRIBLE! It does NOT thicken hair or shall I say it \\&quot;does not\\&quot; even give the \\&quot;illusion\\&quot; of thicker hair! It is a MESS and it looks powdery, not even does it&lt;br /&gt;resemble natural hair fibers!&lt;br /&gt;I am African American and it makes my hair look dull and just an absolute mess!&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s the best and only way to describe it...To be honest, it looks like I very finely crumbled some charcoal and put it on the thin areas! That&#x27;s it! That&#x27;s all it does is sit on top of your hair. Stevie Wonder could see that it looks a total mess! Take my word&lt;br /&gt;for it because I give products a good chance before deciding it is not for me...&lt;br /&gt;but this is just a mess! (I know I said it four times) I&#x27;m tellin ya, you would be better off using mascara or eyeliner or ANYTHING other than this stuff! You could burn some food till it sticks to the pan and crumble the burnt parts and put it in your hair and it would probably look better than this stuff!  (I know I am rambling but it is unbelievable!)&lt;br /&gt;I was going to try it on my husband, but I am glad I didn&#x27;t! I just received it in&lt;br /&gt;the mail today and I called the company to return it TODAY! Besides that, it comes in a tiny container that really looks like a sort of large \\&quot;sample\\&quot; size.  For $21.00 each I could have invited a couple of friends and had a good time at my fav bar and would have been much happier than I am with this product! Don&#x27;t say you weren&#x27;t warned!</li>
