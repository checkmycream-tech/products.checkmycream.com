    <li> Great product, but in the description, the qty shows 2 and I only received 1! I returned it and ordered again per Amazon customer service and the same thing happened!  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I only received only one of the package of two</li>
    <li> Works good with curls, makes them organized and very pretty. But for lasting result you need hair spray.</li>
    <li> I keep my hair straight, not curly, but the smell was so good, that I had to buy it. And I am glad I did. Its a little heavy for straight hair, but the smell makes it well worth it. I also got one for my daugther who has curly hair and gave it to her, and for her its perfect. So it can be used for both curls and straight, and the smell is yummy. Nice texture too.</li>
    <li> had to wait for the shipment. Very happy with the product and cost. Will wait for this price any time.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite curly hair products!!  Great price!!  Good packaging as well! :)</li>
    <li> Product is great, bottle is hard to get the last third of the cream out.  I would give it 5 stars if the packaging was improved.</li>
    <li> No no no. I have dry curly hair and I live in denver (very dry here). I use this product after I wash my hair to crunch my hair and leave it curly. The problem I have with it is, it clumps my hair and weighs down my hair. My curly hair becomes more wavy, knotty, and dry/greasy at the same time (I didn&#x27;t even know that was possible)</li>
    <li> I like the product very much and I have recommended it to several of friends. thanks you very much for everything</li>
    <li> love this product for my curly hair.  Gives nice volume and keeps frizz down</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t leave the house without using this. I&#x27;ve been using it on my curly, sometimes frizzy hair for years. I use it on wet hair and let it air dry. At the end of the day if I need some smoothing I use it on dry hair. Smells great too.</li>
    <li> Only received one bottle of product, not two as promised.</li>
    <li> Keeps my curls under control.</li>
    <li> It is great and lets my curls really come out.  It was not two bottles as advertised, but the seller credited me the difference.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  A Little goes a long way</li>
    <li> I have curly hair, but products I&#x27;ve used in the past never really made my curly hair last. I wanted ringlets, not just big waves with a slight curl. This cream smells so good! What I love most is that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard and crackly.</li>
    <li> I love the scent and consistency of this product. It works well to tame some of my fly away hairs and keep my long curls well managed. If my hair is dry, I dab some water on it, put Foxy Curls on both hands, then scrunch the curls with it and pat down the top of my head to weight down any unruly strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am fairly picky when it comes to scented products and prefer fruit over heavy perfume scents. This one is light and fruity...no allergy issues. For me, it is one of the more successful products I have tried from Bed Head, but I realize it may not work well for everyone.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite hair care products.  It helps limit frizz, split ends, and improves manageability while adding curl and softness.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and this is my favorite product to have soft, natural curls without the frizz.</li>
