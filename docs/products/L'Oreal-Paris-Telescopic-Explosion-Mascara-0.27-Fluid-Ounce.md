      <li>I always have people ask me if my lashes are real when I use this and receive many compliments.</li>
      <li>It dries quickly and is easy to brush on without much clumping!</li>
      <li>The brush on this mascara is absolutely the best being round.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The Mascara was clumpy and the package looked old and was ripped when I received it.</li>
    <li> Lashes Are longer than ever</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara available for making lashes longer. I have tried almost every available brand, including others by L&#x27;Oreal. I always have people ask me if my lashes are real when I use this and receive many compliments. I hope L&#x27;Oreal never discontinues this as they are prone to do, sadly. I will try to buy it all up before they do. This is great ladies.</li>
    <li> Made in USA, not Paris as it says, unfortunately. Purposely mis advertizing? Seems so.&lt;br /&gt;French quality would last longer. I know, i had. American is dry and last only for 20 uses.&lt;br /&gt;Just like everything  else in USA. boooo.</li>
    <li> Best mascara ever, I hate that they discontinued it!</li>
    <li> I use a undercoat for my lashes to boost the volume.....this teeny brush is the perfect compliment! I can get it right down to the roots for color and pull my lashes out to the side without getting it all over my skin in the process. I have had no flaking or \\&quot;raccoon\\&quot; problems, and it comes off cleanly with make-up remover for eyes.......no irritation, no residue.&lt;br /&gt;Really like the goofy little wand!...and the mascara doesn&#x27;t dry out my lashes!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara but can&#x27;t find it anywhere in the store. Mascara is a very personal thing, but I love it.</li>
    <li> I HAVE READ REVIEWS ON THIS LET ME TELL YOU I WAS LITTLE NERVOUS SPENDING MONEY ON THIS BUT THIS IS AWESOME SPREADS OUT NICE DOES CLUMP BUT IT IS WORTH IT LOVE LOREAL I USE THE VOLUMUS MASCARA AND WAS HOPING TO FIND SOMETHING DIFFERENT SO THIS DON&#x27;T BUILD VERY GOOD BUT IT SPREADS WHICH IS NICE SO I USE THE EXPLOSION FIRST FAN OUT MY LASHES AND THEN USE THE VOLUMUS MASCARA BY LOREAL AND IT WORKS WONDERS LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty clumsy with mascara.  I love how easy it is to apply with this wand without making a mess of my face or lashes.</li>
    <li> Love it! Received  exactly  what  I  ordered.</li>
    <li> I used to buy expensive makeup from Dillards like Estee Lauder and Clinique. This mascara is the best I have ever owned. I have short lashes and this makes them look so long and full! It is smudge free as well. I am so happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> my wife is happy, its good</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this mascara</li>
    <li> I have always used regular brush mascaras and was very intrigued by the brush that this one comes with. In the beginning I hated it but it was simply because I didn&#x27;t know how to use it. Once I got a hang of it I can&#x27;t use regular brush anymore. This round small brush allows you to put product on every single lash including those naughty outer lashes. Don&#x27;t apply to much of you don&#x27;t want to get built and spidery lashes. If you use a little your leashes will look natural yet magnificently big and long and thick.</li>
    <li> so glad I finally found this product</li>
    <li> The design of the brush is cute but the mascara does not separate well at all. Also it smudges gets clumpy and sheds under your eye within 20  minutes. The first few times I put it on my lashes did look long but it looked like spider legs. I will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara and is no longer available in stores.  Happy to find online.  The application wand works best for me.  I see you can also buy the wands separately so I may just stock up on the wands and use them with any mascara.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice mascara.. but it really doesn&#x27;t do too much for short stubby eyelashes. However, it reaches and covers up very nicely. I gave four stars because it clumps a lot and make lashes stick together, especially thin long lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yes, and a warning, if heat gets on your eyelashes while using these, they&#x27;ll kind of shrivel up. That&#x27;s the case with several other mascaras, but this one is noticeable! For instance, if the blow dryer passes across your face, you&#x27;ll feel a tug on your eyelashes. I even opened the oven to check on my meatloaf and my eyelashes curled back. lol, I freaked out; I thought my eyelashes burnt.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara and I was so glad I found it online since they have stopped carrying it in the stores.  I love the ball brush.</li>
    <li> The mascara itself is clumpy, and the wand flings mascara everywhere whenever I take it out. I have to touch it up to get rid of clumps, but the dark color and wand shape do help define corner lashes.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara, as the brush allows for precision in application. I don&#x27;t have to worry about accidentally getting mascara anywhere else on my face.</li>
    <li> I do not like this item. I have used it several times but each time it does not work well on my lashes. I cant put my finger on it but it seems a bit dry or something. Wish this transaction would of been a better one. I may give it to my sister and have her try it. May work on her better than me. Arrived in good timing though. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This mascara gets each eyelash individually. It does not clump and really lengthens. I am older, 57, and it makes my lashes looklike they used to.</li>
    <li> PACKAGE WAS OPENED. I DID NOT USE IT BECAUSE OF THIS.  I WOULD APPRECIATE NEW ORDER WITH FRESH MASCARA AND OF COURSE UNOPENED.  THANK YOU</li>
    <li> Product clots and makes a complete mess because it is so watery.</li>
    <li> Used this product for quite a few years,never regretted it!! All the other wands won&#x27;t work for me, I love the way this one is shaped,so I can get into the tight parts of my lashes. It doesn&#x27;t crumble until it&#x27;s at the end of the mascara goop!!</li>
    <li> I thought this mascara wand would be the answer to all my problems but the package was opened when I got it.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could have tried it out, but I don&#x27;t trust this product.</li>
    <li> great product but it is not water proof but what disappointed me give an optimal finish the look.Try another proof water</li>
    <li> The brush on this mascara is absolutely the best being round.  It hits all the lashes with ease.  I hope this produce has not been discontinued by O&#x27;Oreal because I don&#x27;t know which one I would substitute since no one has the round brush for application.</li>
    <li> Favorite mascara. Love the wand.</li>
    <li> this is a great item.you can use this to reach your lower lashes,without having the longer brush getting in your way.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara!  Can&#x27;t find it in my store any longer!  I stocked up with 10.  The brush really separates the lashes, and precise to use.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Want to order more of it.  Best mascara for lash extension.  My lashes never looked so long!</li>
    <li> Very bad it just clumps the eyelashes together would not recommend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use L&#x27;Oreal telescope mascara</li>
    <li> No matter how many times I try to clean the excess mascara off this brush, it leaves my lashes In a clumpy, goopy mess.  Do not waste your money on this.  Very frustrating.</li>
    <li> It works really well, but it get four stars because the pole/stick is really fragile and wobbles a lot</li>
    <li> DO NOT buy this mascara. This is the WORST I have ever used. I read the reviews, saw the bad ones but still figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I have REALLY fine lashes so I figured the little brush wud be ideal. To my dismay that little brush picks up so much product that when u apply it to ur lashes it gets onto ur lids as well. And its VERY gunky and very hard to get off even using waterproof eyemakeup remover :s I am VERY disappointed in this. The brush is kool but the product itself needs to be reformulated. It is WAY too thick!</li>
    <li> A+&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite mascara! Everything about this mascara is wonderful, but I recommend it only to those who have long eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Not as good as I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> I have been unable to purchase this mascara in local drug store and was please to find it available on amazon and ordered three.  The product arrived in a timely fashion but when I opened and removed the items the shipping package the items were smeared with what appeared to be make up foundation and the cardboard backing was separating from the plastic overlay.  The actual mascara appeared to be untouched.</li>
    <li> The product works well. it does what I needed to do it lengthens the last and makes it looks well.</li>
    <li> I have naturally long lashes and so I always go for mascara that enhances them and this does it! I LOVE the ball design because it literally gets every lash, it makes my lashes look beautiful, too bad my store doesn&#x27;t sell this anymore, so glad that amazon has it!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used mascara for a few years and love it ! The package arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
    <li> It feels like there is not a lot of mascara in this or it drys up faster than usual. It can be flaky but it really helps separating each lash making them appear longer.</li>
    <li> My mascara was open! I ended up not using it cause i got scared i woukd get an eye infection!</li>
    <li> I got it cuz it was cheaper than buying it at the drug store, way cheaper ... But I got what I paid for. I thought it took too long to ship, like 2wks. Then when I got it, it looked old and really beat up. Like it had been sitting around a while... It kinda sucks and idk if i want to use it. I prolly won&#x27;t buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my fiancée, who lives in Europe. she really likes it, better than even MAC mascara! She would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara, disappointed it was discontinued. I&#x27;ve purchased several here and the package is always open, strange. Other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Love it, it&#x27;s exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> The brush on this mascara is amazing. It catches every little tiny lash and makes your eyes look wide open.Great Product and Greater price.</li>
    <li> I love the applicator on this - a round ball. I wish they sold this in the stores but I can no longer find it. That is why I purchased six tubes on Amazon.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> This wand is wonderful for catching all those little hairs at the ends of your lashes, top &amp; bottom. My lashes are now pretty sparse due to aging, but with a couple of coats of this on my bottom lashes and I actually look like I have some! I use a different Mascara on my top lashes, but I do use this on my  inner corner top lashes.  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> The brush on this L&#x27;Oreal mascara is the best I have ever used.  Cannot find in stores any longer.  It really separates lashes and puts mascara on evenly.  Why do companies always discontinue their best products???</li>
    <li> Love this mascara.glad I get it at Amazon!</li>
    <li> Very old stock evidently.  Tried to use but dried up and hardened.  Virtually unuseable.  Made the mistake of ordering multiples because it was hard to find.</li>
    <li> I have used this type brush before and liked it, then couldn&#x27;t purchase it anymore from Wal Mart. I like the ball brush because I don&#x27;t stick myself in the eye. Before I found it on Amazon I went from store to store looking for it. I bought two and hope I can get others later on.</li>
    <li> This mascara is easy to use and wash off, gives lashes a flattering length but it clumps easy and flakes when dry.</li>
    <li> Best mascara ever ... I&#x27;m so glad I can purchase it here because it is very hard to find it in the stores.</li>
    <li> I use this after I put on my regular mascara. It helps to thicken and lenghten my lashes a bit and is easy to use.  It also gets the corners of my eyes better b/c brush is smaller.  It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
    <li> I love the brush!  It gets the corners really great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every mascara known to man.  I Love This One.  I was sooooo disappointed when it was discontinued in stores.  So I rely on Amazon and picked the cheapest price for it.  I can&#x27;t see paying more then it was worth because it is discontinued.  So I but about three at a time.</li>
    <li> The case open when i received it. I think i was a glue issue. The problem was it was dried out. I bought it because they stop carrying them in the stores. Took a while to get here.</li>
    <li> i love this product.  my sister bought it for me the first time.  i was a little skeptical because of the little brush.  however, when i tried it ...i loved it.  i&#x27;ve used nothing else since.  i have a hard time finding it these days.  it doesn&#x27;t seem to be in the stores any more.  i was told they quit making it.  i&#x27;m happy as long as i can find it online.  i don&#x27;t want to me without my L&#x27;Oreal Paris Telescopic Explosion Mascara....ever!!!</li>
    <li> I wish L&#x27;Oreal didn&#x27;t stop producing this product.  This is the BEST mascara I have ever used, and at age 62, believe me I have tried many!!!  It must be the round ball brush, but every lash is covered without clumps.....and it is super easy to use on the bottom lashes as well.  I don&#x27;t know what I will do when I can&#x27;t find any more of these to buy!!!</li>
    <li> This mascara come open 😡 I dont like this! You have to check your description and dont say use!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! It does the job of elongating my lashes. I have to apply two coats in order for my lashes to notice, but great product. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> exactly what my friend wanted. Thanks</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara ever.  The round spiky brush gets into the corner of the inside and the outside of the eyelash without getting it all smeared everywhere!!  It dries quickly and is easy to brush on without much clumping!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had long lashes but I&#x27;ve never seen then as full and black as this mascara makes them. The brush has a tendency to clump if you don&#x27;t wipe off the excess on the tip, however it makes lashes thicker and longer than ever. They are fanned out to the fullest extent and really attract attention to you eyes. Definitely worth 3x the price. Great value.</li>
    <li> very happy, separates lashes. long lasting, dark.Happy</li>
    <li> The mascara is really lengtning and volumizing as well, the only thing is that it lakes somewhat longer to cover all the ewelashes in the eye because of the brush, good thing is that you can easily reach to those small inside corner of the eye lashes but to apply in a rush is not the best.</li>
    <li> I really only bought it for the wand. I threw the bottle of formula away. So I can&#x27;t tell you what the formula is like, but the wand is great. I simply use it with my favorite mascara and it&#x27;s good for my outer and inner eye corners</li>
    <li> at first it seemed a little dry but as i continued to use it and was better. I purchased this before from another seller and it was much better. This order wasn&#x27;t in the original packaging but loose.</li>
    <li> it takes a little getting used to with the little round brush, but it goes on smooth after you get the hang of it. all in all a good product</li>
