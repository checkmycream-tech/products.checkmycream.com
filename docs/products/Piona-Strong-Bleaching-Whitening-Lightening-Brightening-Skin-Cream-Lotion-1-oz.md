<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was so excited when I got this product reading the reviews and all. I have very clear skin I just wanted something to lighten my skin tone by one or two shades. This products caused sooo much acne on my face and neck. I used it only two days and so much acne and clean my face so many times a day and always exfoliate before I use it. I stopped using it and I still keep breaking out. So very mad</li>
    <li> You will be sorry .  Priced too expensive. Effects don&#x27;t last a week, although it makes for nice skin.  You will have to pay the rest of your life, the rest of your life, the rest of your life, the rest of your life, the rest of your life,...and price continually goes up.  Started at about $15. in 2014 now it is as high as $95.00., for a decreased amount.  Was 2ounces now 1.69 ounces and price is way too much.  KEEP YOUR PRODUCT.  YOU NEED US AS CUSTOMERS just like we need/wanted(I really mean liked this product)...But I will forego this product.  Amazon has so many others I have found I can go to.)  Do your homework search Amazon, there are others.  Google Google Skin lighteners 😣</li>
    <li> Honestly this stuff works, I&#x27;m not the one to write reviews. I used it only three times and I see the difference already. My husband said babe you&#x27;re looking brighter. He doesn&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Works good lighting my skin</li>
    <li> This cream is wonderful, I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks now, and and i just love it,i definitely will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> maybe everyone skin is different, I see no difference. Will continue use.</li>
    <li> It work better than expected</li>
    <li> This product is working Good...i saw results in just a week and my skin is glowing plus it smells good. I give it an A+</li>
    <li> I received this product in a timely manner, but it made my face break out and my skin now has more black spots and my skin is very rough and has turned very dark even though I used a SPF-50 cream when I went outside in the sun.  I wish I could find a cream that would lighten your skin without breaking you out and ruining your skin and darkening it.  Any suggestions?</li>
    <li> This cream does work, but after a while it made areas of my face darker. The smell of the cream was not pleasant at all. I gave it two stars because it does work. I just was not satisfied with how it made my skin dark in certain areas of my face.</li>
    <li> I can tell the difference in just a little as 3 weeks . I never write reviews but after my mother complement me on my glow I had to write a review.</li>
    <li> Do not east waste Ur time buying this I swear</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a stylist and my hands are in water a lot, my knuckles and cuticles were very dark and I looked older by looking at my hands because they look rough. I use this cream in the mornings and at night for two weeks and I could tell a noticeable difference. No more dark knuckles and cuticles and my hands felt smooth and softer. I&#x27;m going to purchase the serum and soap as well. I know with the cream you must be consistent to see results!!! Great product for lightening blemishes!!!!</li>
    <li> I love using the cream it really change my skin compaction cause my skin was so dark every since I start using the cream I&#x27;m back to normal .thanks guys.</li>
    <li> Item is great! Works fast especially if you target your problem areas.. I find that it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. Most of the time if im having a case of the breakouts, it&#x27;ll even help with that, which most bleaching creams will cause more harm than good. Not crazy about the smell but I only use it at night.. I&#x27;m not sure how this product will work under makeup and I don&#x27;t have the patience to try... Works fast..</li>
    <li> Best whitening cream EVER!!!!! I&#x27;ve been trying for years to get rid of my pregnancy dark spots with no sucess. Piona made my skin even like it used to be when I was a teenager without burning or making my skin dry. I am glad I found it!!!!!</li>
    <li> This s*** is the truth!!! Alotta creams say what they do but ain&#x27;t do it</li>
    <li> This is the real deal. The best skin lightening cream I have ever used. Within days my face was brighter, dark spots faded evenly and the skin felt so smooth. Awesome product, a bit pricey but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Work&#x27;s for me ...and yes I have used it on my women parts no problems I have used this brand of cream for Years with no problems do yourself a favor and get it ...it has made me feel more convenient in my own skin  ... .</li>
    <li> Works well with bleaching but be careful because it will definitely burn your skin . Luckily mine healed . Also left me with this terrible rash...never again</li>
    <li> This cream is the TRUTH!!! I suffered from uneven skin tone due to constant picking of blackheads, which left me with dark spots all over my face, especially on my chin &amp; under my neck area.  It was all  cleared up in a matter of 2 months of consistent use. I did have some MILD irritation in the beginning.  Very very pleased with my results. .HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!</li>
    <li> it works out for me . my age spots are slow fraded like 3 weeks .. i might will buy another this one. Hope they will be gone away from me. Thanks to it .</li>
    <li> I have been using the lotion for three weeks and some days now and this lotion works. I use it on my entire body and my  body is glowing. I didn&#x27;t like the smell from the beginning but now am used to it.  Shipping is fast but the lotion is so expensive so i will be glade if the company or seller can reduce the price in order for  us to purchase more. The lotion works for me. Piona is an awesome lotion for people who wants to tone their skin because it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t bleach u too much. Will continue to use it. Can i have a discount on my next purchase?</li>
    <li> This is the best thing every</li>
    <li> I wish this product came in bigger and wasn&#x27;t so pricey but it works. I used it with a bleaching soap and they worked well together. I mixed this cream with my lotion and applied twice a week. I would repurchase but not right away becus elf the price.</li>
