    <li> Excellent quality by far! Stainless steel pieces are extremely well made! Worth the money! I was hesitant to spend so much money on a manicure set. The saying goes, you get what you pay for and the set is well worth the money than some of the cheap sets out there. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this kit, I highly  recommended it.  The quality of the steel the product is made of is superior to a cheaper brand I also bought.  Bravo for Agesus!</li>
    <li> i bought this kit thinking more of pedicure some reviews said it had many pedicure tools i was very dissapointed with the pedicure instruments it does not have a tool that can reduce the toe nail and the only set of big pliers is not functional at all it has a hook on the back and it doesnt help when you try to cut your nails the small scissors are fine for your hands and feet but it definetely needs a couple of more things for the pedicure if you are more interested in the manicure i think it will be ok</li>

    <li> Absolutely love this kit. As a cosmetologist who does pedicures, I can really chomp down on those those thick old lady toe nails with these tools!</li>
    <li> All of the tools (except the file) are high quality. They do not have a brand name on the side, but who cares as long as they each function properly. I tried each one and they are all smooth moving, sharp, and cut as intended. It is mixed, part for manicures and part for pedicures. By far the best quality I coud have bought for what I paid!</li>
    <li> This manicure and pedicure kit is very good, the quality and presentation are nice and are elegant for few money, I recommended it thanks for all!!!!</li>

    <li> I like there are a lot of tools in one set. I hoped it would be higher quality as well. I can not say so. It is good and good for the money. I just still cannot find the quality it was 15-20 years ago even in sets for almost $200.</li>
    <li> The items are not the best but are ok! I thaugh will received a best quality items it has not brand on the items and the case is so ugly, but it cut fine!</li>
