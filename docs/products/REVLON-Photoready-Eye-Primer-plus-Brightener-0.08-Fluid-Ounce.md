      <li>I bought this product after hearing about how great it was.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m totally impressed and plan to keep buying more.</li>
      <li>This was a great deal it has plenty of liquid very useful!!</li>
      <li>Threw it out after 3-4 attempts to give it a fair try.</li>
      <li>I have fair warm-toned skin and there&#x27;s no way</li>

      <li>nice product with good color and ease of application-just wish it stayed on</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>And for the price difference, that&#x27;s pretty impressive.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with the result!</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>but it blends in quite nicely with my foundation.</li>
      <li>it kind of did the job.</li>
      <li>Does a nice job of coverage, and I like the applicator.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
      <li>I was so pleased when I used it and noticed that my eyes didn&#x27;t water at all</li>
      <li>It was okay</li>
      <li>The latest make up artist</li>
      <li>I have used others that were better.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>and this one is peachish and worked better than many products I have tried.  </li>
      <li>The eye primer works great, but does not come out of the container very well.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived</li>
      <li>I do recommend it :)</li>
      <li>Must order more soon</li>
      <li>Its pretty good.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without this primer, in fact I am in need of more!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve received so many compliments on how bright and clear my face has been and in all actuality</li>
      <li>It works fairly well, doesn&#x27;t need any touch ups for normal wear.</li>
      <li>Good product though, gives an excellent matte finish and matches my skintone (which is pale Caucasian with a lot of peach) very well.</li>
      <li>so my shadows can be applied smoothly and stay on all day.  </li>
      <li>My eyeshadow goes on better and stays looking fresh for hours.</li>
      <li>the formula is light making your skin feel silky smooth</li>
      <li>The older I get, the more my eyelids seem to show more redness and fine veins, which throws the color of my shadow off somewhat.</li>
      <li>I did not purchase this particular product from Amazon.....but feel the need to leave an honest review for those thinking of purchasing it here.</li>
      <li>If I use it under make-up, it creates a clean \\&quot;palette,\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>It works great to reflect the light and to cover up dark eye circles.</li>
      <li>To be honest, the situation is too far gone for me to ever expect to look 30 again, but this one does about as well as anything is going to.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what the description says, it brightens the eye and is easy to put on.</li>
      <li>Then one more click &amp; you have more primer than you would use on your entire face &amp; neck, &amp;</li>
      <li>At first I thought the color would be too light</li>
      <li>This is great for under the eye to brighten dark shadows.  </li>
      <li>A few great things about Revlon Photoready line:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It actually did a nice job of lightening the under eye area.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the better choice for me.</li>
      <li>It also brightens the under-eye area nicely underneath my regular foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>had been using a similar product by Estee Lauder, which I liked pretty well, but at around $60 I was reluctant to invest in another tube and wondered if something else might do just about as well.  </li>
      <li>If I wear it by itself, the over-all effect is exactly as advertised:  brighter.  </li>
      <li>first rule about wearing makeup is that it should look like you&#x27;re not wearing any makeup</li>
      <li>and this does exactly that.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good, natural color and is easy to apply as little or as much as you need.</li>
      <li>It was light, easy to apply, covered dark circles and brightened my eyes without looking like I had a gloppy concealer on.  </li>
      <li>First, I&#x27;m well over 40, and that&#x27;s really showing around my eyes.  </li>
      <li>really matter; it blends very well to any skin type or color&lt;</li>
      <li>For me, this is a a very satisfactory product.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use much makeup, so</li>
      <li>Not at all cakey and really does help brighten your eyes.</li>
      <li>I actually only use it under my eyes as a light concealer.</li>
      <li>Takes a while to come out, comes out too fast</li>
      <li>I really like this to cover any redness and brighten my eyes.  </li>
      <li>However, once applied, the product leaves a satin-smooth palette on my lids, and my eye shadows adhere to the primer very well.</li>
      <li>I was very upset to find it didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
      <li>I really like this.</li>
      <li>very pale.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and then you don&#x27;t even get the very end.  </li>
      <li>bought this because there were no other options at the current store, and it is better than having no primer, but would not rebuy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used enough products to know that there are no miracles to be found at the cosmetics counter, but,this product makes a real positive difference for me.  </li>
      <li>Does not stop creasing in the main eye crease or under eye.  </li>
      <li>I needed a decent eyelid primer</li>
      <li>But the package is so tiny, I ran out quickly.</li>
      <li>:) Will say I have a rather pale skin color, this tint isn&#x27;t intended for those of olive or darker tones.</li>
      <li>Second, I&#x27;m extremely fair-skinned, and around my eyes the skin is becoming more and more translucent, revealing veins that are difficult to cover with anything.  </li>
      <li>My eyelids and undereye areas are mutl-toned -- grayish, some areas that are very yellow, some more pink -- and all on the oily side.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>general skin tone is on the fairer side (slightly more towards yellow than really pink).</li>
      <li>It is hard to get the product out of the bottle, you have to click it so many times, it seems like it will never come out.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t really do anything to highlight or brighten my skin, though, and it annoys me that it only comes in one pink-toned shade.</li>
      <li>After twisting to dispense, wait a second to see how much comes out.</li>
      <li>I have used it 2 times so far..</li>
      <li>Granted, it doesn&#x27;t cover as thoroughly as a concealer, but the overall effect is much nicer.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m guessing if u have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Plus, after only using it a few times, now nothing is coming out at all, no matter how many times I turn it.  </li>
      <li>When applying, though, my suggestion would be to brush a very small amount of the liquid on each area, smooth it with a fingertip or Q-tip if too much comes out, and blend well.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it, great prodcut, will probably buy again</li>
    <li> This works well, the only brightener that I&#x27;ve noticed that works for me.</li>
    <li> very good product, excellent service! I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! My eyes look brighter. My eyeshadow goes on better and stays looking fresh for hours. I do recommend it :)</li>
    <li> Takes a while to come out, comes out too fast</li>
    <li> Does not stop creasing in the main eye crease or under eye.  Does not brighten. Useless</li>
    <li> This concealer is grainy and seems to enhance wrinkles rather than conceal.  It&#x27;s dryish so that may account for its tendency to emphasize lines.  Try Bobbi Brown eye concealer sticks.</li>
    <li> This is the lightest coverage of any concealer I&#x27;ve ever bought</li>
    <li> I bought this product after hearing about how great it was. I was very upset to find it didn&#x27;t work at all. My eyeshadow would fall off within an hour or two of application. Not only that but it burned my eyes like crazy, and my skin is not that sensitive. The brush was almost impossible to use to apply it and the color was very off. Overall I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving 4 stars and not five is because the product comes out inconsistently. Sometimes I need only two clicks to get enough product onto the brush for an eye, sometimes I need seven, and there&#x27;s no rhyme or reason to it, this will be as I go from eye to eye. Good product though, gives an excellent matte finish and matches my skintone (which is pale Caucasian with a lot of peach) very well.</li>
    <li> When it comes to cosmetics, what works wonderfully for one person is a dud for someone else.  For me, this is a a very satisfactory product.  Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My general skin tone is on the fairer side (slightly more towards yellow than really pink). My eyelids and undereye areas are mutl-toned -- grayish, some areas that are very yellow, some more pink -- and all on the oily side. Though I really need concealer, the multitude I&#x27;ve tried have been too thick looking, and ultimately melt. In combination with mascara or any eye makeup, after a few hours I look like a racoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eye primer does a very good job of evening my skin tone.  Granted, it doesn&#x27;t cover as thoroughly as a concealer, but the overall effect is much nicer.  I noticed someone here complaining that it&#x27;s too dry.  Well, that works well on my oilier skin. Even if it looks a little dry going on, after a few minutes, it will have blended into my skin quite nicely. In terms of color, I was initially concerned that it was too pink for me, but again, after a few minutes, it blended.  If I wear it by itself, the over-all effect is exactly as advertised:  brighter.  If I use it under make-up, it creates a clean \\&quot;palette,\\&quot;  and I think it even keeps the makeup in place better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used enough products to know that there are no miracles to be found at the cosmetics counter, but,this product makes a real positive difference for me.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this primer, in fact I am in need of more!! The packaging came in sealed, there were no worries of it being previously opened or tampered with. Very happy with it :) Will say I have a rather pale skin color, this tint isn&#x27;t intended for those of olive or darker tones.</li>
    <li> Excellent whether you want to put makeup over it or not.  I don&#x27;t use much makeup, so I really like this to cover any redness and brighten my eyes.  No need for eyeshadows!</li>
    <li> Exactly what the description says, it brightens the eye and is easy to put on. I nightly suggest this product!</li>
    <li> It was okay it kind of did the job. Didnt brighten my eyes like it said it would but then again im also very pale.&lt;br /&gt;On a sidenote if i put it on too thick it really burned my eyelids. I&#x27;m guessing if u have sensitive skin you might not want to try this.</li>
    <li> This was a gift, and the recipient uses it all the time and just loves it.&lt;br /&gt;My first rule about wearing makeup is that it should look like you&#x27;re not wearing any makeup and this does exactly that.</li>
    <li> eyeshadow started to crease within 1-2 hours. application was alright but texture was chalky and not very smooth. bought this because there were no other options at the current store, and it is better than having no primer, but would not rebuy.</li>
    <li> this is a great product to get! I have very thin skin around my eyes so my skin is darker like I have bags and I have dark veins that show and with this, it covers it up completely. I&#x27;ve received so many compliments on how bright and clear my face has been and in all actuality, it&#x27;s just under my eyes, my skin doesn&#x27;t look paper thin anymore haha. I will continue buying this item. (:</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this product! It covers darkness and makes your eyeshadow stay put! The inner corner of my eyes usually waters when I apply eyeshadows and causes the eyeshadows to wash off. But not with this product!! I was so pleased when I used it and noticed that my eyes didn&#x27;t water at all (but I also used some allergy eye drops at this time!) and my eyeshadow stayed in place all day without washing off! I&#x27;m totally impressed and plan to keep buying more. The first time I used this product was in combination with a white eyeshadow base by NYX and that was a huge mistake as the eyeshadow makeup creased and caked horribly, eventually washing off entirely from the corners of my eye. But that didn&#x27;t happen at all when I used this product alone (in addition to using some allergy eye drops in my eyes prior to applying the makeup) and the eyeshadow stayed on all day without any incidents. I was like, OMG! I love this product! My only complaint is that it&#x27;s hard to control the amount it comes off from the tip.</li>
    <li> No problems with de purchase. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Perfect coverage! a must have for loose eyeshadow or if you want to add an extra pop to your colors</li>
    <li> You turn &amp; turn &amp; turn &amp; nothing.  Then one more click &amp; you have more primer than you would use on your entire face &amp; neck, &amp; it&#x27;s only meant for your eyes!  Plus, after only using it a few times, now nothing is coming out at all, no matter how many times I turn it.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I am always searching for something to hide the major dark circles under my eyes.  The latest make up artist I went to said try a peach tone product and this one is peachish and worked better than many products I have tried.  This is my second tube so I can have one at home and one in my travel bag.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product but was dissapointed with it, it has no coverage at all. And as a primer I wasn&#x27;t impressed either.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It works great to reflect the light and to cover up dark eye circles. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I like using it for under my eyes.  It does keep my eyeshadow on all day when I use it as a primer.  I&#x27;m happy with the product and will buy again!</li>
    <li> This was a great deal it has plenty of liquid very useful!! I use it a lot!! Great primer! H</li>
    <li> I like the product, but find it a little pricey for the amount in the container.</li>
    <li> It is hard to get the product out of the bottle, you have to click it so many times, it seems like it will never come out.</li>
    <li> I needed a decent eyelid primer so my shadows can be applied smoothly and stay on all day.  After trying expensive ones at department stores and being disappointed, I saw the Revlon product at my grocery store and decided to give it a go.  I used it on both the lid/brow area and under my eyes -- after all, the packaging suggested it would &amp;#34;brighten&amp;#34; my eyes.  Ha!  It actually did a nice job of lightening the under eye area.  When applying, though, my suggestion would be to brush a very small amount of the liquid on each area, smooth it with a fingertip or Q-tip if too much comes out, and blend well.  It is a little difficult to control the amount of product that is pushed through the bristles of the little brush by turning the end of the tube.  However, once applied, the product leaves a satin-smooth palette on my lids, and my eye shadows adhere to the primer very well. I am pleased with the result!</li>
    <li> I really like this. The older I get, the more my eyelids seem to show more redness and fine veins, which throws the color of my shadow off somewhat. You do have to be careful not to twist it too much or it comes out too heavily. After twisting to dispense, wait a second to see how much comes out. Does a nice job of coverage, and I like the applicator. I have very sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation.</li>
    <li> I use this for under eye circles and redness around the nose. It works well, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Its pretty good. I actually only use it under my eyes as a light concealer. Its not full coverage. It has some shimmer to brighten, but its not overly done or crazy. Very VERY subtle. Blends well and stays on.</li>
    <li> A few great things about Revlon Photoready line:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- A little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;- the formula is light making your skin feel silky smooth&lt;br /&gt;- coverage is divine&lt;br /&gt;- the shade does&#x27;t really matter; it blends very well to any skin type or color&lt;br /&gt;- it gives a perfect finish, always&lt;br /&gt;- price is reasonable, given that you only need a little amount every use&lt;br /&gt;- it stays on</li>
    <li> You have to twist the bottom multiple times to even get a drop. Then once you do a bunch at once. It basically does what it says, but not worth what you pay for it.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use it as a highlighter to contour my face and this works perfectly. At first I thought the color would be too light but it blends in quite nicely with my foundation. I have only tried one other, the Lumi Touch from Maybelline, to which I can compare. This is by far the better choice for me. It works fairly well, doesn&#x27;t need any touch ups for normal wear. It also brightens the under-eye area nicely underneath my regular foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the size- not a considerable amount for all the packaging.</li>
    <li> Not at all cakey and really does help brighten your eyes. It&#x27;s a good, natural color and is easy to apply as little or as much as you need.</li>
    <li> I bought this concealer/eye brightner thinking it&#x27;d be really good. Now the thing i dont like about this is that when you get the product out and apply it under your eyes and anywhere else, it tends to just dry up in place and when you go back to finally blend it in, its all dry and powdery looking and it gives you a cakey look. I&#x27;ve used this on more than one person with different types of skin, all moisturized before i applied this ,and im not impressed with this one from revlon. Don&#x27;t waste your $$$.</li>
    <li> It burned my eyelids so I repurposed it as a brightener for cheekbones and other highlight areas. But the package is so tiny, I ran out quickly.</li>
    <li> The eye primer works great, but does not come out of the container very well.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived when promised.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have used others that were better.  It covers very well, but the stem is really hard to turn to get the concealer and then you don&#x27;t even get the very end.  You see it in the tube but the wand doesn&#x27;t turn anymore - so that is a waste of money.  I will try something else next time.l</li>
    <li> I did not purchase this particular product from Amazon.....but feel the need to leave an honest review for those thinking of purchasing it here. This product flat. out. sucked. Little to no coverage, even if you only need little to no coverage. No brightening effect. And when you twist the bottom of the tube to get product out, you either get barely any OR a ton of it comes out. Really disappointed in this product. Threw it out after 3-4 attempts to give it a fair try. Boo.</li>
    <li> Covers dark circles and causes the shadow to stay in place.  I never NOT use it.  Must order more soon</li>
    <li> nice product with good color and ease of application-just wish it stayed on</li>
    <li> I have used it 2 times so far.. I like the way it primes the eyelid.. I have dark inherited circles so I don&#x27;t expect alot to stay on through the day.  It takes several clicks to get the product to appear.  I guess you have to do it slow because it can come out all at once.</li>
    <li> Dealing with my under-eye area is a challenge.  First, I&#x27;m well over 40, and that&#x27;s really showing around my eyes.  Second, I&#x27;m extremely fair-skinned, and around my eyes the skin is becoming more and more translucent, revealing veins that are difficult to cover with anything.  This makes a good base for my cover cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using a similar product by Estee Lauder, which I liked pretty well, but at around $60 I was reluctant to invest in another tube and wondered if something else might do just about as well.  And this product does.  To be honest, the situation is too far gone for me to ever expect to look 30 again, but this one does about as well as anything is going to.  And for the price difference, that&#x27;s pretty impressive.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this product.  It.  It dried my skin around my eyes and really did not highlight my eyes.</li>
    <li> This actually lived up to the ad. It was light, easy to apply, covered dark circles and brightened my eyes without looking like I had a gloppy concealer on.  Kudos on a great product</li>
    <li> THIS HAS A DOUBLE FUNCTION.  I USE IT TO CONCEAL ANY DARKNESS BY MY EYES AS WELL AS USING IT ON MY EYELIDS TO HELP THAT MY EYESHADOW DOES NOT GET CREASES.</li>
    <li> I actually like this product, but only as an under-eye primer to help creasing and sometimes as a concealer over pores or blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t really do anything to highlight or brighten my skin, though, and it annoys me that it only comes in one pink-toned shade. I have fair warm-toned skin and there&#x27;s no way this does anything to illuminate it. It also won&#x27;t be a great primer for eyeshadow or anything.&lt;br /&gt;It covers my blemishes when I need it to, though that&#x27;s not really its intended purpose. I just dot it on and blend with a finger.&lt;br /&gt;I like this product, but it doesn&#x27;t really do what it claims, sadly.</li>
    <li> This is great for under the eye to brighten dark shadows.  I use it every day and will continue to buy it.</li>
