    <li> With the heat of summer soon arriving,Shower to Shower,is a Body Powder that refreshes and softens and cools your skin.  Heat can be harsh on anyones skin,and this is a quick picker upper when there isn&#x27;t time to shower or after you have showered. Wonderful fresh fragrances to choose from as well.</li>
    <li> I cannot find varieties in body powder where I live.  This is very nice and light.  This is good for summer.</li>
