<li> The set of 4 only came with two squirter and those are only half the length of the bottles do you can&#x27;t get all of the product out.</li>
<li> This product comes with only 1 spray nozzle and it is about 2 inches short of reaching the bottom of the bottle, Rendering it pretty much useless.</li>
<li> The sprayer  line only goes about 2/3 down, if that, in the bottle... so you have close to a cup of  contents you can&#x27;t spray out...</li>
<li> They come with a sprayer that sprays a mist in a wide area.</li>
<li> This set comes with 2 empty 16 oz Amber bottles with the caps as well as one spray nozzle.</li>
<li> I use one for my homemade window cleaner and the other one for all purpose cleaner.</li>
<li> I also had another nozzle which I used to cover the other bottle</li>
<li> /&gt;The set of (2) GLASS bottles both come with a cap that seals onto them tightly.</li>
<li> The bottles are heavy and very thick and you can tell they are made out of quality amber glass.</li>
<li> I like that they are made of glass because that means there&#x27;s no plastic slowly working</li>
<li> This isn’t too bad.</li>

    <li> I like these bottles even though they are glass they spray really really well,I highly recommend these bottles u dont have to worry about the bottles leaking :)</li>
    <li> The bottles have great quality, not cheap sprayers.  The glass is very thick, hoping won&#x27;t break easy if they fall.  I was very satisfied with the quality.</li>
    <li> Love these jars.  Do wish it had come with two sprayers. The sprayers are really great.</li>
    <li> This product comes with only 1 spray nozzle and it is about 2 inches short of reaching the bottom of the bottle, Rendering it pretty much useless.</li>

    <li> These amber glass spray bottles are just what I was looking for.  They are 16oz each, and come in a set of 2.  They also come with mist pump trigger spray nozzles.  These bottles are well-made and durable. I use these bottles to hold cleaning solution which I purchase in concentrated form.  By using these glass bottles I do my part in keeping all those plastic bottles spray cleaners come in out of the landfills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I would definitely recommend this set of bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for sharing my honest and unbiased review. Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
    <li> I really would rather a spray top for each separate bottle, but these are as I expected and work just fine.</li>
    <li> I have used this with my EO cleaning product.</li>
    <li> the bottles are fine, BUT THE SPRAYER IS USELESS, and only comes with one for both bottles.</li>
    <li> I usually save my empty spray bottles to put my own homemade cleaning products in. So when I was offered these Empty Amber Glass Spray Bottles from Posh Select for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered them. They arrived ready to use, just need to fill with my cleaners. I like that they are made of glass because that means there&#x27;s no plastic slowly working it&#x27;s way into my spray! I definitely recommend these Empty Amber Glass Spray Bottles from Posh Select for anyone who likes to make their own household cleaners.</li>
    <li> High quality sprayer, Thick plastic and very durable. The sprayer screws on to the top of the bottle and has no leaking issues since it secures so tightly to the bottle itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set of (2) GLASS bottles both come with a cap that seals onto them tightly. When applying the sprayer I simply unscrew the cap and screw the sprayer in instead. The glass is thick and does not feel cheap - The main reason I love glass bottles is because it does not absorb odors and does not wear down over time. This sprayer set seems like it will last me for years to come with how nice the quality is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) spray options - A fine mist, great for watering the leaves of plants and a jet stream (one line straight forward, sprays pretty far away distance). I use my sprayers for multiple purposes. I make my own lip gloss, and use the sprayer in the process, also using them for watering my plants as previously stated. I keep the extra bottle in the fridge because sometimes when I wake up I will use it to spray my face on hot summer days. On the fourth of July I plan on taking both of the bottles to the park to watch the fireworks. They will keep everyone cool, and comfortable. Sample provided for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> Great for essential oil cleaner</li>
    <li> Works great for essential oil cleaning products.</li>
    <li> This isn’t too bad. I like the fact that it’s glass, so it should keep anything we put in here well. My mother has wanted to try something for her cooking oil as the cheaper brands just squirt the oil and not cover the pan as well. She’d like something to mist more so. I love that it’s a set of 2 so you can keep two products without having to pour it into another container just to get the use. We simply empty the nozzle, give it a quick clean with water, and ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this set is that the stem is kind of short. I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I was not paid or sponsored for my opinions all thoughts reflected in this review are my own.</li>
    <li> These have came in handy for liquids that can not be stored in plastic.</li>
