      <li>It&#x27;s also very rich and isn&#x27;t appropriate for warmer weather.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the Eminence line because it is an organic line that doesn&#x27;t harm your body.  The results are outstanding.  Too many harmful chemicals these days that can cause cancer.  Eminence is chemical free.</li>
    <li> I have mature fair skin (50+) and was looking for a night cream which I believe is a necessity at my age (I use the Eminence Cornflower Serum during the day for firming--great product, too).  This Monoi night cream has a very rich texture which means a little bit goes far in covering your face/neck areas (adding a few drops of water on occasion prior to application during hot summer months also does fine).  This 2 oz. jar will last long as I&#x27;ve been applying it for about one month and have only used about 1/4 of the jar.  It&#x27;s worth the price and it smells wonderful!  As we all know, baby boomer women didn&#x27;t have access back in-the-day to the newly developed broad spectrum SPF products for our faces during sun exposure.  With that noted, make this purchase as you won&#x27;t regret it.  Bottom line, I am sold on Eminence organic skin care products and will never purchase another skin care line :)!!!</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time last night and it felt SO WONDERFUL when I put it on!  Just glorious!!!  Love Eminence products, which are new to me, and this is wonderful!  Product arrived in very good condition, which I appreciated.</li>
    <li> Great product overall! I love this line of skin care!</li>
    <li> Have used this for years and am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Ok but NOT amazing ,,, it does nothing special to my face ,,,!!!</li>
    <li> Use this night creme regularly.  It&#x27;s rich and keeps my skin from getting dry and flaky in the winter.</li>
    <li> The cream is light and easy to apply, has a nice scent.  It does not have preservatives&lt;br /&gt;so using it up quickly is necessary...have seen little improvement in skin moisture.</li>
    <li> Read the reviews, thought this would be great.  NOT. First, smells.  Second, irritated by skin, small bumps after use. THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN. Anyway, the smell is horrible. Like old lawn grass after it has been cut, loaded with mildew.  Horrible.</li>
    <li> My Sister-in-law introduced me to this cream and I love it!  While in her salon I heard other customers raving about this cream and Eminence in general.&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin and I use the night cream for both day and night.  (in the morning I slightly water it down)</li>
    <li> took me a while to get used to the smell, but now i like it. really moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out or feel excessively oily. i usually switch around night creams but i think i will re-order this one!</li>
    <li> smells heavenly (light and sweet, but not over-powering like peony or rose), and does an amazing job as a night cream.  I dilute the product with a small drop of water between my fingers and use it to spread out more easily.  This way also makes the jar lasts longer, like 4-5 months, before I have to replenish my stock.</li>
    <li> love these products, would recommend the entire line</li>
    <li> Perfect for aging skin.</li>
    <li> The Jury is still out.</li>
    <li> I really like Eminence products because they are organic and you know what you are putting on your skin.  This product has a great smell and consistency.  A little bit goes a long way.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month now and I have noticed a difference in my skin.  I will keep using Eminence brand products.</li>
    <li> My aging skin LOVES this product!</li>
    <li> Purchased this product because of so many glowing reviews.  However, it is definitely not for me.  First, I found the cream heavy and pore clogging.  After one days&#x27; use had a couple of small hive like bumps.  Stuck with it and continued to break out, especially in lower part of face around chin and lower cheeks...a little between my eyebrows.  Didn&#x27;t like the way it went on, so thick and suffocating, and my skin didn&#x27;t like it either.  As is often noted here, we all react differently.  Will go back to my Annmarie Borlind which has been fantastic, but I got bored with the same thing year after year.  As the saying goes....&amp;#34;If is ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Nice cream - helps a little with neck, but it isn&#x27;t a miracle worker.</li>
    <li> I have used the Eminence products for a number of years. Everything I have used has worked well. I will need to use this product for at least the remainder of the jar to see how well I like it. So far I am pleased.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to see that Monoi is actually Plumeria and/or Frangipani (depending on what country you&#x27;re in).  I&#x27;ve always loved that smell, so it was a big surprise to have this fragrance in a smooth, clean product such as this night cream.  The fact it doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals in it, but is instead purely natural is enough.  It applies easily and it&#x27;s been two weeks now.  My skin is softer and looks better than ever.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Not greasy, soaks in, provides all day moisture.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK. I don&#x27;t care for the fragrance - very strong. It&#x27;s also very rich and isn&#x27;t appropriate for warmer weather. I had a breakout after using it for just 2 days. It may be fine for winter. I still don&#x27;t care for the smell though...</li>
    <li> Very good. Scent is sligthly unusual, but I find it pleasant. Feels good on the skin</li>
    <li> I personally love the smell of this (I think of a tropical location) and enjoy rubbing it on at night.  It feels like it soaks in and moisturizes deeply and my skin feels moist without being greasy.</li>
    <li> I received it yesterday and so far I love it. Really works, I was using the bamboo firming fluid. I did want the lemon  grass cleanser.</li>
    <li> I haven extremely dry skin due to the climate in while I live in. This stuff feels amazing and smells divine! Ive been receiving facials with Eminence products for a while and love how well they work. This is another great product of theirs, I combine this with the age corrective coconut facial cream and neroli eye serum in the daytime. Love them all!</li>
    <li> I really like most of eminence&#x27;s products.  Some of them can be a little on the heavy side for non-dry skin, so it&#x27;s really dependent on the user.</li>
    <li> This product is very nice.  I like it because for one, it is organic and does not have any chemicals, but it really makes your skin feel good.  It moisturizes your face nicely and you can see a change in the morning.  I have started using this product line and love it. I would highly recommend others to try it.</li>
    <li> I was concerned when I first purchased it that it would make me break out but that has not happened (and I have very sensitive skin).  Plus you just need a small amount so it last a long time.</li>
    <li> I first got this night cream at my hair salon.  Then they were out when I needed it again.  Amazon has it all, all of the time!!  This is a quality product without cancer-causing additives.</li>
    <li> Love the light scent and after only using it for a few days, I can see a slight difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
    <li> I really like this night cream! This my second jar. I like that skin looks smoother and feels very soft. It has also helped with dry patches!</li>
    <li> Used it once and worked great...but could not get over the strong scent. I should preface this by saying I have an aversion to cilantro and for some reason, this has an overwhelming smell that reminded me of the herb! An incredible shame, because my face felt incredibly smooth and soft the next morning. I have kept it and will try to give it to someone who may benefit from the cream (fairly pricey). Eminence is my absolute favorite brand--great on my ultra sensitive skin and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Smells pleasant, very hydrating (I live in the desert so that&#x27;s key) and goes on smooth and absorbs well.  A little goes  along way and my skin feels tighter, my wrinkles seem less pronounced and my face stays hydrated all night!  I am fair-skinned, combo skin, in my mid-thirties and think this works well for me.</li>
    <li> Great! Product arrived as quoted and is just what I wanted! Thank u!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is very heavy and just the right consistency for night.  In fact, since it has been so cold, if I go out, I use it in the daytime.  I will definitely recommend this product. I also let my spouse use it.</li>
    <li> THE SCENT IS LIGHT AND LOVELY.  THE CREAM IS LIGHT NOT HEAVY AND&lt;br /&gt;I ACTUALLY WEAR IT DURING THE DAY AND NIGHT.  MY SKIN IS VERY DRY AND&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU LIKE THE SUN, YOU&#x27;LL REALLY LOVE EMINENCE MONOI AGE CORRECTIVE!&lt;br /&gt;I WOULDN&#x27;T BE WITHOUT IT...</li>
    <li> I just received the product so not sure of its effectiveness.  I do like the way it feel and I love the smell.  Also the fact that its all natural ingredients sold me.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Eminence skin care products. Was introduced to them at a spa. I was running low on my already pricy Karen Herzog products, so I decided to try a few of these in it&#x27;s place since I enjoyed the facial &amp; liked that these products were 100% organic. So, yes, they&#x27;re not cheap, but a little goes a long way, so it takes several months to use all of the product up. Well worth it for the skin care benefits! ANYWAY, to the point, the Monoi Age Corrective Night Cream is just DREAMY... It smells so amazing &amp; feels so good on my face that I can&#x27;t wait to wash off my makeup at night &amp; slather it on. If it&#x27;s too thick, you can thin it up w/ drops of water (as directed), but I like it&#x27;s dewy finish! So refreshing. I go to bed with my face reminding me of what my Hawaiian honeymoon smelled like every night. :) And, I just feel like the texture &amp; tone of my skin has really improved. It&#x27;s nice to put something so good for your skin onto your face, from the goodness of the Earth, not chocked full of chemicals. You know you&#x27;re doing something good for yourself.</li>
    <li> I love it ! It works for me 😀</li>
    <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Organic and the fragance is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Cream is very relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;I have the night, day cream and the cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;All of them work perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;No harmfull chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;Price a little bit costly.</li>
    <li> I really love this night cream! I have sensitive , mature skin. If I use a department store or drug store face cream and get it near my eyes they itch and turn red. I can put this facial cream right on my eyelids and they are fine! I believe it is b/c it has no chemicals that irritate. After one week of use I liked it so much that I ordered one of the day time creams. I like a lotion  or cream  with fragrance. This one is very pretty and yet it does not linger so that while you are sleeping you smell it. I like to switch around but I seriously feel at this age in my life I have finally found a keeper.</li>
    <li> I love this cream because it is so natural. It does not break my face out and keeps it moisturizer all night.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Eminence products.  I like them because I can control the thickness. For example, I add several drops of water to dilute the moisturizer, creating a light or lighter feel during the warmer months; or I add a tiny drop to make it easier to smooth on my skin, creating a thick or thicker feel during the colder months.  You can use water or, if you use an Eminence serum and/or hydrating mist, you can use those products as emulsifiers, instead of the water.  My aesthetician, in fact, recommended that I emulsify all Eminence moisturizers in order to activate properly the essential elements.</li>
    <li> I saw a difference after just one night. Now after a month I am getting comments and compliments every time I go out. Love this cream!</li>
    <li> If you want to go organic on your skin, then the Eminence line is what you want. I used Lancome for  years and was completely satisfied with my skin using  their products. A few years ago I realized how many chemicals are in skin products that have very nasty side affects with long term use and decided to go organic. It took about a month for my skin to adjust to the new regime but I am more than satisfied with all of the Eminence products. Would highly recommend them to anyone who wants to stop polluting their bodies with chemicals.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer for dry skin, but the calendula is a heavier cream and for the winter I will go back to this one.</li>
    <li> Great cream.  Calms redness.</li>
    <li> I do love this night cream.  It is heavy.  If you have oily skin, then definitely add water to thin out.  Only use at night for sure.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer.  Seems to make a real difference.</li>
    <li> Really hydrates and puffs up my skin. It is very thick and I sometimes thin it out with a llittle water before applying. On the down side it can clog your pores if you use too much.</li>
    <li> I am a blonde in my early 60s with dry, sensitive skin. This is the BEST, most hydrating moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever had. Second best would be Eminence&#x27;s Linden Calendula. I use this cream nightly with the Eminence Lavender Age Corrective Night Concentrate. I saw visible results within less than 2 weeks: my skin looked and felt less dry, definitely moisturized, and seemed fresher, clearer with less fine lines. I LOVE it.</li>
    <li> When I first tried this I thought it would be way too heavy of a cream for my skin but I was wrong!  I apply with wet fingers to a cleansed face and it thins it just a bit while still hydrating my skin over night.  I am liking it!  I have been a Clairins user for years and I would buy this again before Clairins.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it and will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Love this cream.  A rich treatment at night, nice feel and smell -- kind of like aroma therapy!</li>
    <li> Love this!  This skin line is great - your skins feels tight and toned after each use.</li>
    <li> magic ! Use on my neck and face......</li>
    <li> This cream is really nice for the evening.  Smells good and you wake up with moist skin.  It&#x27;s my new favorite night cream.</li>
    <li> Eminence is the only product I want to put on my face. Love the organic, natural of ingredients. And really love the aroma.</li>
    <li> This is the best day and night crime  I have ever used!</li>
    <li> Love it. My face feels so awesome the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;Even better when I use the pear and poppy seed microderm abrasion  and strawberry rhubarb dermafoliant</li>
    <li> Works great, everyone compliments me on my skin. I use the whole product line. Smells great too. I like a heavy dewy cream as I live in a high altitude desert climate with very low humidity.</li>
    <li> Not for super-sensitive skin: has Ubiquinone aka Coenzyme Q10.</li>
    <li> I love the feel and smel of this product.  My skin feels well-nourished.</li>
    <li> Eminence is cosmetic line that provides full range of products for face and body.  All of the products are made of organic components and product is made in Hungary.  Most recently, company came up with the new product called Monoi Age Corrective Night cream.  I am already using their day cream Rosehip Whip Moisturizer and was looking forward to this night cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monoi is type of Tahitian gardenia flower.  Like any exotic (white) flower it has very sensual fragrance.  I absolutely love this cream.  Not only is it great for skin and it has healthy ingredients, but its aromatherapy is soothing, calming and overall pleasant.  The same company also makes Monoi body lotion and that may be the next product I will purchase.  I am so excited about this new addition to their line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wanted to thank seller for sending me a sample of Eminence&#x27;s new lavender eye corrective nigh serum.  The sample lasted me almost a week and I used it in the morning and at night because of the lavender scent that is truly authentic and my skin loved it.</li>
    <li> The supplier delivered item on time.  I have not been using the product long enough to say if it give results, but I like the way it makes my skin feel and I love the smell.</li>
    <li> I started using this cream a couple of weeks ago but I already feel the difference. My skin feels smoother and brighter when I wake up in the morning. The cream smells delicious and you only need to use just a little bit of it to spread on your face and neck.</li>
    <li> I have found this product with out the seal  !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of this for night and the apricot calendula cream for day. It is very thick but despite using it every night for weeks I haven&#x27;t had a breakout once. I just moved to a very dry climate, and this is beyond my expectations!!</li>
    <li> Finally found a product that actually keeps my terribly dry skin hydrated. I only need a thin layer of this (and I can dilute with water in the summer so that it lasts longer) and then I don&#x27;t have to worry about flaking at ALL! My skin feels great, no irritation.</li>
    <li> I have been using this line and really feel this night cream makes my skin feel so soft and hydrated. This is a much better price than in the salon that I go to. I&#x27;m 64 and live this stuff!</li>
    <li> I use it day and nite; it&#x27;s very rich, which is great for my 70+ year old skin!</li>
    <li> I have not noticed any improvement in my skin since I started using it 4 weeks ago.</li>
    <li> Great nighttime moisturizer. Love the feel. Not heavy or greasy like some moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried great for mature skin and dry climates.</li>
    <li> One of the best over night creams I have ever used.  The smell is so so.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> This product really helps keep my skin looking youthful and removes sagging.</li>
    <li> I love their products but don&#x27;t care for the smell of this cream. It&#x27;s unpleasant.  Sorry.</li>
    <li> Thank you for such great products and fast delivery!</li>
