### Positive Reviews

      <li>Best dental floss ever!</li>
      <li>Best floss ever!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s incredibly flimsy floss.</li>
      <li>This product solves both problems, and does a great job.</li>
      <li>This is the most perfect iteration for dental floss I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>But I found the 490 to be almost as good.  </li>
      <li>For a safe floss without teflon this is a good product.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to handle / maneuver /</li>
      <li>This is the dental floss that I was taught how to use in grade school through a healthy dental program.  </li>
      <li>It was recommended by my periodontist many years ago.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite floss</li>
      <li>It is very fine and lightly waxed so doesn&#x27;t get stuck.</li>
      <li>the floss shreds easily.</li>
      <li>Easily slides between teeth and removes plaque.  </li>
      <li>I discovered this floss years ago at my dentist, free sample.</li>
      <li>desired, you can lightly rub /</li>
      <li>My favorite dental floss - used to find it at Whole Foods and they quit carrying it, so was glad I could find it online.</li>
      <li>am rating the 490 Classic White Lite Wax a 5 because it is the best floss I have used.</li>
      <li>well worth the cost!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for many years so really like the product.</li>
      <li>considering I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the quality of the floss itself and threw the whole thing away.</li>
      <li>The fine material works well for flossing and feels more effective than other dental floss products.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind purchasing it at a higher price --</li>
      <li>Thanks for prompt service.</li>
      <li>My teeth are very close</li>
      <li>However, for teeth that are very close together</li>
      <li>floss the sides of every tooth in your mouth and lightly touch or message your gums at the same time.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My former dentist use to sell it to me for really cheap, but it works so well,</li>
      <li>nice and narrow but frays a lot.</li>
      <li>The 490 Classic White holds up better and doesn&#x27;t break as easy as the 420 Black.  </li>
      <li>We think it is far superior to the usual drug store floss.</li>
      <li>It is significantly thinner than any floss I&#x27;ve used previously, which makes it much easier to get between my teeth.</li>
      <li>fine for tight places.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many flosses, and they either don&#x27;t want to go between my teeth, or they are so hard to keep hold of.  </li>
      <li>Because POH Dental Floss is hard to find in most stores.  </li>
      <li>I used to get it directly from POH, and this time wondered what the Amazon price might be.  </li>
      <li>Nice thin dental floss.</li>
      <li>A little more than a month ago I decided to try both the POH 420 Black Lite Wax and the POH 490 Classic White Lite Wax.  </li>
      <li>no other floss can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
      <li>After getting my teeth cleaned there was less breakage, but the 420 would still consistently break and 490 would only break</li>
      <li>In fact, it&#x27;s surprisingly strong for how thin it is.</li>
      <li>It frays a little more easily than heavier flosses, but not too bad.</li>
      <li>It fits very well between tight teeth, and resists shredding and tearing.  </li>
      <li>My husband really likes the floss, but I felt the order was a little deceptive.</li>

<li> it&#x27;s very thin, it&#x27;s strong, so</li>

<li> /&gt;100 yards will seemingly last forever ( at least 3+ months ).&lt;br</li>

    <li> For a safe floss without teflon this is a good product.  However, for teeth that are very close together the floss shreds easily.</li>
    <li> nice and narrow but frays a lot.</li>
    <li> This is the dental floss that I was taught how to use in grade school through a healthy dental program.  Hard to find in our area.  Thanks for prompt service.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s our favorite floss and difficult to find.</li>
    <li> We have been using POH super thin white floss for probably 20+ years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We wouldn&#x27;t even think of using any other floss.  It gets in between teeth that no other floss can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even tho it&#x27;s very thin, it&#x27;s strong, so if it happens to catch on a tooth as you floss, it doesn&#x27;t break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to handle / maneuver / grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If desired, you can lightly rub / floss the sides of every tooth in your mouth and lightly touch or message your gums at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100 yards will seemingly last forever ( at least 3+ months ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price you pay for what you get is terrific, in our opinion.  We would recommend POH super thin white floss to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  -  John and Margaret Kleber&lt;br /&gt;  Rockford, Illinois</li>
    <li> I did not expect this Floss to be a hundred tiny hairs all twisted together but that&#x27;s not their fault that&#x27;s mine for assuming it would be a solid piece of Floss. It&#x27;s not meant as a bad review but maybe if someone else is expecting it to be a solid piece of Floss they can know it&#x27;s not.</li>
    <li> Have used this floss for 50 years!  Tried others but none compare.&lt;br /&gt;Very fine for tight places.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s incredibly flimsy floss. Worse yet, I spent quite a while wrestling with the little notch on the top of the container, trying to thread the floss into the notch in order cut a strand. I never did get it threaded and had to find something to cut a strand each time I used it. Ultimately, I decided it was not worth the effort considering I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the quality of the floss itself and threw the whole thing away.</li>
    <li> Nice thin dental floss. I like the container it comes in too. Haven&#x27;t had it break apart or get stringy as others have mentioned.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes the floss, but I felt the order was a little deceptive. I thought when it said (12x100) at 99% off I would ge 12 items, but only one arrived.</li>
    <li> We have used POH dental floss for years.  It was recommended by my periodontist many years ago.  We think it is far superior to the usual drug store floss.</li>
    <li> Best dental floss ever!</li>
    <li> This floss is to old school, very hard on teeth.</li>
    <li> My favorite dental floss - used to find it at Whole Foods and they quit carrying it, so was glad I could find it online. It is very fine and lightly waxed so doesn&#x27;t get stuck. The fine material works well for flossing and feels more effective than other dental floss products.</li>
    <li> Not &amp;#34;coated&amp;#34; with wax or anything.  Easily slides between teeth and removes plaque.  My former dentist use to sell it to me for really cheap, but it works so well, I don&#x27;t mind purchasing it at a higher price -- well worth the cost!</li>
    <li> POH Litewax floss was recommended by my dentist. It is significantly thinner than any floss I&#x27;ve used previously, which makes it much easier to get between my teeth. It frays a little more easily than heavier flosses, but not too bad. In fact, it&#x27;s surprisingly strong for how thin it is.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite floss and I&#x27;ve been using POH for years.  I used to get it directly from POH, and this time wondered what the Amazon price might be.  Suffice it to say that I saved a lot of money.  Floss types are by personal preference and this one works for me.  Gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Best floss ever! I discovered this floss years ago at my dentist, free sample. Then, my local pharmacy carried it, but then stopped. Thank goodness I can go online and get it still.</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s insane, but I paid more for shipping than the item cost.  Why?  Because POH Dental Floss is hard to find in most stores.  This stuff is super thin and tough.  It fits very well between tight teeth, and resists shredding and tearing.  This is the most perfect iteration for dental floss I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many flosses, and they either don&#x27;t want to go between my teeth, or they are so hard to keep hold of.  This product solves both problems, and does a great job.</li>
    <li> A little more than a month ago I decided to try both the POH 420 Black Lite Wax and the POH 490 Classic White Lite Wax.  My teeth are very close and I was looking for a floss that would not hang up or be impossible to get between the teeth.  I use a Flossmate handle because it makes it a lot easier to floss.  I also went to the dentist and had my teeth cleaned so I have a before and after perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 420 is definitely thinner and it is easier to get in between the teeth, especially the really tight ones.  But I found the 490 to be almost as good.  The one area that I did notice a difference is strength of the floss once it begins to fray.  The 490 Classic White holds up better and doesn&#x27;t break as easy as the 420 Black.  After getting my teeth cleaned there was less breakage, but the 420 would still consistently break and 490 would only break occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am rating the 490 Classic White Lite Wax a 5 because it is the best floss I have used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for many years so really like the product.</li>
