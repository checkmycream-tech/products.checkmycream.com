      <li>I found that being a bit more stressed caused me to break out around my chin.</li>

      <li>Remove makeup with a wipe or olive oil (fantastic for makeup removal AND scar healing) BEFORE CLEANSING!</li>
      <li>(your face has more gunk on it than in the morning)&lt;br</li>
      <li>LOVE this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I started buying it through Amazon because it&#x27;s a better deal than buying in stores, but also because my stores stopped carrying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>By the way, this product did not dry out my skin and it has a very pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s resident, smooth, acne free and just lovely!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve have been using this product for over 2 months now and I am not disappointed at all!</li>
      <li>I really wanted to try it because I heard and read many good comments about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>very good product ,my face was full of acne and since i used it my face is more clear day by day.</li>
      <li>This has been great for me so far!</li>
      <li>I really like this product because it has a creamy texture which is good to moist acne-prone skins.</li>
      <li>I should have known it would by the clue of strong perfume.</li>
      <li>my face is fine.</li>
      <li>I am fifty, fair complexion and have very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>This is a great product and such a deal for three.</li>
      <li>Great product but description is misleading because it says &amp;#34;Pack of 3&amp;#34; but actually there is just one tube.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this lotion paired with a benzyl peroxide (10%) cream for months now with fantastic results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth, spreads easily, and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>After I put it on, my skin feels fresh and clean!</li>
      <li>The Neutrogena Blemish concealer makeup stick is also a form of snake oil as they only give a tiny bit of product for you money, but it is the best blemish concealer I have ever used and does help make the pimple go away, just wish they gave you more product for the price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in complete love with this stuff and if salicylic acid works on your skin, you&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
      <li>This product seems to be effective in keeping my skin clear, but it also dries out my skin a bit.</li>
      <li>The product advertises that it will minimize breakouts in 8 hours, which I&#x27;ve seen to be true.</li>
      <li>Buying online now because every store I would go to for this product no longer carries it, but for 3 containers at said price, it&#x27;s not a bad bargain.</li>
      <li>but I could feel them whenever I touched my forhead or if the angle of the light was just right.</li>
      <li>It give me more acne to be honest, cause drying and not very helpful.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very light, completely absorbs into your skin, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.</li>
      <li>This stuff has a wonderfully smooth texture that goes on very evenly</li>
      <li>After I used for about 2 months with fantastic results, I switched to a gentle cleanser (CervaVe), this Neutrogena face lotion, and a 10% benzyl peroxide cream</li>
      <li>Keeps my skin clear and just enuff moisture to keep it healthy.</li>
      <li>But this was worth a shot.</li>
      <li>so I guess it was worth it.</li>
      <li>This product contains the same Acne Fighting Ingredient found in popular products like Proactive, but for a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>I can barely find it in stores, so I always make sure to order it online.</li>
      <li>the point is it really works and safe to use on sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I do not like it very much.</li>
      <li>But the lotion is limited in the Acne defense package, I really need one more lotion!</li>
      <li>so I was really counting on this working!</li>
      <li>So for the first time in my life I decided to try an over the counter acne medication.</li>
      <li>A bit thick for summer use but a great product otherwise.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to spend a lot of time outside, but I am sure SPF will be needed along with this.</li>
      <li>First off this is a pack of 3</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had clear and acne free skin ever since I&#x27;ve used this product.</li>
      <li>He looks better the same day!</li>
      <li>I have been using it for a couple of months, and in the first two weeks my skin did indeed \\&quot;rapidly clear.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m still on my first one</li>
      <li>AcneFree helped SO much!</li>
      <li>I really hope they don&#x27;t stop selling it!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great!  Can&#x27;t find it anywhere, but here!</li>
    <li> Good product, works well, noticeable improvement in acne.  Recommended product.  My son and I both have acne.  We both use with good results.</li>
    <li> I do not have acne, but this helps with make up, pore clog breakouts!</li>
    <li> For the past several years I used Aveeno Clear Complexion Correcting Treatment to prevent and clear the blemishes I get with hormonal fluctuations.  It was 0.5% salicylic acid and worked well without over-drying my \\&quot;maturing\\&quot; skin.  When it was discontinued, I bought up all the leftover tubes I could find...and when those finally ran out, I scoured the stores and internet for a replacement.  I tried two or three pricey products.  Not  only were they drying, my skin seemed to \\&quot;rebound\\&quot; and I was getting what I would characterize as persistent, moderate acne.  So there I was with a red, flakey, zitty face, when I decided to try the Neutrogena Rapid Clear lotion.  I thought the 2% salicylic acid would be too much, but I&#x27;m happy to report that the lotion is soothing and not overdrying at all.  I use a thin layer over my entire face morning and night.  I have been using it for a couple of months, and in the first two weeks my skin did indeed \\&quot;rapidly clear.\\&quot; I am not even really getting much in the way of my usual monthly breakouts.  In fact, I think it works better than the Aveeno. Ah, relief. Glad I bought the three pack.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 34 years old and never had problems with acne besides the occational pimple here and there. But after I turned 34 I got a massave acne attack on my forehead!  They started out very small, almost invisible to the eye but I could feel them whenever I touched my forhead or if the angle of the light was just right. Then they started to get bigger and very ugly looking. I was going crazy! I tried cleansing it, wearing no make-up, oil cleanse, nothing would work. So for the first time in my life I decided to try an over the counter acne medication. I did the research and found out that this product worked well for adult acne. After using this product twice a day for about a month, I&#x27;m down to the last two tiny pimples.  Thank you Neutrogena!! By the way, this product did not dry out my skin and it has a very pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> It give me more acne to be honest, cause drying and not very helpful. Maybe it works for most people or with make up. I do not like it very much.</li>
    <li> This product is the greatest. I use a neutrogena face wash the cleansing pad then this lotion. All of my acne went away within two weeks. I have the worst acne I have had it since I was 10 been picked on my whole life cause of it and finally found stuff that works. I stopped using this product for one week and kept using the other two products and all my acne came back with a vengeance. So use this product it really does work.</li>
    <li> My skin used to be very clear and when I was in my teens Clearasil worked very well for me. Clean and Clear worked well in my twenties, but once I hit my thirties my skin went haywire and I could not figure out what worked on my skin. I tried Clearasil again, Clean and Clear, Proactive, none of them have worked. I have only been using the product for two days and there is an enormous change already. The breakouts I did have either disappeared or are on their way out. I have never had an acne problem until now, my cheeks being my prime breakout zone. I hope my skin doesn&#x27;t change on me again and they never discontinue this product. I&#x27;m only giving this product four stars because I just started using it and I&#x27;m a little apprehensive after going through so many other products.</li>
    <li> Really a gentle product. My face can&#x27;t take pretty much anything because it just will break out but this one is just great. Absolutely no discomfort or dryness, no redness even slightest (unheard of on my skin).It actually calms any redness. And it does clear the skin no doubt-just be consistent with applying it.    Really great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Clean and Clear persa gel for about four/five years, and I&#x27;ve started using this lotion for less than a year now and I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed! I have pretty bad breakouts on my forehead and around my mouth, and ever since I started using this, with the Oil Free Acne Wash (pink grapefruit), I have seen very few huge breakouts like I use to. This product has salicylic acid which really helps and prevents those huge, major breakouts for eight hours. I really love this product &#x27;cause it treats my acne and it&#x27;s a lotion, so no dry skin!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, acne prone skin and so does my 12 year old niece. This works for us both. 2% salicylic acid keeps skin clear.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion paired with a benzyl peroxide (10%) cream for months now with fantastic results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My acne story:&lt;br /&gt;When I was 18, my GYN suggested birth control for regulation of my menstrual cycle. A few months after beginning, my face began to break out. It progressively got worse and I consulted a doctor. I tried lots of Rx, but nothing would consistently work because the birth control was causing hormonal problems. I tried ProActiv after I gave up the Rx acne meds. No luck. I suffered from acne for a few years until recently. I just turned 22 and my face is so much better. I stopped taking my birth control medication about 8 months ago. Subsequently I tried ProActiv with little success (I went through almost 3 months of use before I gave up on that). I decided to try a drugstore brand acne system called AnceFree. This worked to kick-start my skin&#x27;s recovery! AcneFree helped SO much! After I used for about 2 months with fantastic results, I switched to a gentle cleanser (CervaVe), this Neutrogena face lotion, and a 10% benzyl peroxide cream (they all work the same). This has been my system ever since. This 1.7oz tube has lasted me 3 months so far with twice daily use all over the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this lotion, if you are willing to give it time to work. No acne medication is going to clear your face within a week, or even two weeks. You MUST give the products time to work! Sometimes, like ProActiv for me, they just don&#x27;t work. This stuff is around $7 for a tube, so there isn&#x27;t much to lose. Unlike ProActiv which is almost $50 a month. There is no harm in giving this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;+Do not use anything else with salicylic acid in it&lt;br /&gt;+Do not use anything with salicylic acid in it with a Rx acne medication&lt;br /&gt;+Use a GENTLE cleanser&lt;br /&gt;+Wash twice daily only&lt;br /&gt;+Wash for two minutes at night (your face has more gunk on it than in the morning)&lt;br /&gt;+MAKE-UP WEARERS: Remove makeup with a wipe or olive oil (fantastic for makeup removal AND scar healing) BEFORE CLEANSING!

    <li> If you use this every night, you will have much much much clearer skin! It&#x27;s amazing. I wish they made giant pumps of it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend. She has always gotten reasonable result from Proactiv (albeit a high and recurring expense). But nothing - I mean nothing - helped when the &amp;#34;time of the month&amp;#34; came around. The stuff would come out in clusters around her chin and destroy her pretty face. Yup, there used to be one week in each month when we didn&#x27;t go out to eat or play. I did some research and realized that, while a face wash is important to clear away the dirt and toxins, it is not a good vehicle to deliver the medicine (Salicylic Acid or Benzoyl Peroxide). Why? Because it all gets rinsed away and only some residual amount will be left on the face (note: the manufacturers do compensate for that fact by upping the concentration of the medicine in the face cleanser, but it doesn&#x27;t negate the reality that after rinsing off, very little it is left on the skin to do the work). A cream, on the other hand, is meant to be applied to stay on the skin, so the medicine keeps working. Makes perfect sense to me. It has been working very well for the girlfriend, though I must say that occasionally on those really bad days of the month, she still breaks out - perhaps only an act of God could stop that. Overall, this cream has definitely provided a lot of improvements. Good price too, for a 3-pack.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Great non-greasy coverage. Seems to prevent breakouts. I like the smell too.</li>
    <li> Long-time Neutrogena customer</li>
    <li> A bit thick for summer use but a great product otherwise. I like this a lot. I would recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> I did notice it working immediately but slowly. I woke up with smaller blemishes but they were still there and looked like they weren&#x27;t going anywhere, anytime soon. This may be better for those with few and far between breakouts that are small.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I have stubborn acne on my chin and it&#x27;s always red and bumpy. This stuff along with the spot gel and cleanser cleared it up within 24 hours. Very impressed and happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I am fifty, fair complexion and have very sensitive skin. This product really broke me out horribly. I should have known it would by the clue of strong perfume. I mean really strong. It took two days and bam. A painful, nasty breakout. Ugh. Please beware of this product if you&#x27;re sensitive to perfumes (and/or whatever else is in this concoction of chemicals). Perhaps it was the Salicylic Acid 2%, as well? I don&#x27;t know. Just be cautious with this one.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product! It works really well for my skin, removed 80% of acness on my forehead only after 1 week using it. No experience on break out or dry out. Highly recommend for anyone who has trouble with acness</li>
    <li> I can see a small reduction a night or a few days later while using this so I guess it was worth it.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for the weekend now &amp; a lot of my blemishes have already faded, some are even gone! I got the 3 pack so I was really counting on this working! But I feel much more confident applying this to my face when I am broke out, then a regular lotion which might make my blemishes worse! LOVE this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing to say the least. I have been using it for a month now and my skin has never ever looked better. It&#x27;s resident, smooth, acne free and just lovely! I never thought I would say that about MY skin. Even around TTM, no breakout, no redness and no large pores! So, I decided to give one to my sister since she suffers from acne too. She can&#x27;t believe it. She called it &amp;#34;miraculous&amp;#34;. This is from someone who has tried it all! We love it, so we&#x27;re sharing it around to our friends so they can reap the benefits. I myself hope to use it off a very long time. I highly recommend you try it. Best ever!</li>
    <li> This is the only thing I&#x27;ve found to work on my weird skin. I can barely find it in stores, so I always make sure to order it online.</li>
    <li> Great for my razor bumps.</li>
    <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t use this enough but I can&#x27;t tell at all when I use this product. The only thing I know is this doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts but doesn&#x27;t help them go away either.</li>
    <li> This was an accident because the pharmacy was out of the neutrogena spot treatment I usually get (and love).  I had just come back from dermatologist.  He wanted me to try panoxyl wash again before resorting to another cycle of Accutane (4 years since last one). Panoxyl dries me out so badly that I crack and peel so I decided to try a very light and infrequent panoxyl wash and this nuetrogena lotion together.  Instant success!  I&#x27;m amazed. It worked on cystic back issues perfectly in a day. If only it came in larger sizes.</li>
    <li> Been using this for close to two months now. I don&#x27;t really get too much acne like I used to. I mainly got this to help exfoliate and lessen my visible acne scars. I use this in conjunction with retinol products and microdermabrasion crystals, off and on throughout the week. Seems to be working! As for acne, I&#x27;ve tried this before several years ago, and salicylic acid just doesn&#x27;t do it for me. Have to use benzoyl peroxide for my acne and occasionally still do as a spot treatment now. This stuff does have a pleasant, fresh, fruity(?), scent. It&#x27;s smooth, spreads easily, and absorbs quickly. Does slightly dry the skin out so might want to follow with a moisturizer if it&#x27;s too drying but I have an oily complexion so after about an hour my face is fine.</li>
    <li> Recently I have been a bit more stressed than normal. We moved into our first home as homeowners, I had a big audition I wanted to nail and money has been tight because a few unexpected expenses popped up. I found that being a bit more stressed caused me to break out around my chin. I never had acne growing up and I do not have sensitive skin so I didn&#x27;t know how to tackle these unwanted bumps. They were not the kind that could be popped. Just little stress pimples that clearly needed to go. I first used a great acne face scrub in the shower and then this face lotion to moisturize my skin. It worked! Within mere hours I noticed the pimples were significantly smaller and not red at all. After using this the next day, for only the second time, my pimples were basically gone. I am in love with this product. It makes my skin feel great and hydrated and tackled those unsightly pimples. I highly recommend this face lotion!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this. It feels greasy on my skin and has not helped clear my skin at all. May have made it worse, but I can&#x27;t say that for sure. I bought the three pack, so I have two unused tubes. I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve read a few reviews about this product and most of them were recommendation to use it to clear away acne. I&#x27;ve tried many products and all of them are very expensive and some were even harmful to my sensitive skin (it made my skin red and in worse condition than the actual acne itself, on top of having acne). I figured what do I have to lose? So I tried this product and to my surprised those reviews are right! This product really work, well it took awhile like a few weeks to see results but the point is it really works and safe to use on sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve had clear and acne free skin ever since I&#x27;ve used this product. Here&#x27;s the trick I used. I apply a generous amount to my whole face every evening after a shower and leave it on, even sleeping with it on. After continuous daily use you will see results. Heck, I like this product so much that even though my acne is completely gone, I still use it because it also double as a lotion. Basically I use it everyday now after a shower and it helps keep my skin acne free.</li>
    <li> Cheap enough to use on the body. Works very well if applied consistently.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe that it will stop breakouts just using this alone if that&#x27;s what you were hoping. Through a lot of trial and error, having tried a combination of acne cleansers and moisturizers to help with breakouts,  one thing I discovered is that whenever I don&#x27;t use this lotion and use something else, I will end up getting a pimple. It keeps my face moisturized without it feeling heavy or greasy. This has been great for me so far! I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin so I&#x27;m not sure if this will be good for those. But this was worth a shot.</li>
    <li> It is just right for post-adolescent minor acne.  Mild enough for regular use at night, but effective enough to minimize those &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; acne breakouts.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for many years.  I am 65 and still tend to have the occasional breakout, but because of this cream,  they are few and far between.  I know, because I went without for 6 months as I was unable to find it locally, and fought breakouts the whole time.  Finally, went on line and ordered a year&#x27;s worth.  Not only controls breakouts, but makes my skin very soft.</li>
    <li> I bought this product about a month ago. I really wanted to try it because I heard and read many good comments about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the first few weeks, I used this lotion in the morning and my usual night cream because I did not want to jump straight into this product. However, the results were pretty minimal. It did help my back acne a lot though, giving me a clear back. Subsequently, I used this lotion during both morning and night and the results were more obvious. Currently, my acne have not fully cleared away as I wanted them to, but they are a lot smaller now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the pack of 3 so I will definitely continue using this product. Totally looking forward to clearing acne off my face!</li>
    <li> I really like this product because it has a creamy texture which is good to moist acne-prone skins. I have eczema and this product works incredibly well. During winter times, my skin gets really dry and I still have some acne going on but after using it, everything has changed... I totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> Really moisturizes my skin, not sure if it has helped with the acne, but I feel better using it vs another type of lotion. I didn&#x27;t realize that it was a pack of 3 so that was a major plus. This lotion also does not leave my skin oily which is a problem with some of my other facial lotions. I would buy again, even if it may or may not be helping with the acne issue.</li>
    <li> love it！Really works on me! But the lotion is limited in the Acne defense package, I really need one more lotion!</li>
    <li> This product contains the same Acne Fighting Ingredient found in popular products like Proactive, but for a fraction of the price. It&#x27;s most active ingredient is 2% Salicylic Acid, used to lessen the appearance of acne and heal blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have incredibly sensitive/combination skin, so I started with one application at nighttime. The product advertises that it will minimize breakouts in 8 hours, which I&#x27;ve seen to be true. The product didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, so I tried using it twice per day and had no problem. It is working for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only time I&#x27;ve experienced redness, dryness, or other skin reaction is when I used the product on an area of my skin that did not have a break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, a little goes a long way! Keep that in mind when you see the big price next to this tiny box!</li>
    <li> very good product ,my face was full of acne and since i used it my face is more clear day by day. I will buy it again</li>
    <li> Great product but description is misleading because it says &amp;#34;Pack of 3&amp;#34; but actually there is just one tube.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 25 years old I&#x27;ve been dealing with acne since I was 10. I am now on the road to completely clear skin thanks to this lotion Biore blemish toner and aveeno clear complextion pads now all I have to do it is my skin under control and find something that will fade 15 years of acne scars... wish my luck</li>
    <li> This is great stuff.  My son has acne, and uses this to remove the redness and acne marks.  It moisturizes his skin while killing off the bacteria that causes acne and also removing the redness at the same time.  He looks better the same day!</li>
    <li> Must have in my skin care routine work freak under makeup! Keeps my skin clear and just enuff moisture to keep it healthy. I have been using it for years and highly recommend! Great for combo or oily skin</li>
    <li> with my daly face wash and birth control. I have little to no acne as an newly adult for teenager. I would Highly recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I just love this product!! This product may be a repackaging of a product Neutrogena made some years back that I could no longer find anywhere, as I recall the ingredients are similar. As a &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; woman, I find this product exceptionally gentle and moisturizing to my sensitive dry skin.  I find it clears up those annoying ongoing blemishes in no time flat without the irritation I have experienced with other products. An added bonus is that it noticeably reduces pore size in under a week.  I use morning and night.  The price of this 3 pack is a real bargain. I am ordering a mini-stockpile just in case I cannot locate this great product again !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many moisturizers before and this one is probably the best and fairly priced. Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily like other lotions and it only takes a small amount to get the job done, thus making the tiny size of the container last a good month or two. Clears up my acne for the most part except for little spots here and there but nothing too noticeable. Buying online now because every store I would go to for this product no longer carries it, but for 3 containers at said price, it&#x27;s not a bad bargain. If you haven&#x27;t tried this product it won&#x27;t hurt to give it a shot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 36 year old dude. I have struggled with complexion issues ever since puberty. It&#x27;s not so horrible now as it used to be, but as a grown man, I don&#x27;t want pimples here and there! Coupled with washing at least in the morning and night, this lotion has provided to be probably the best I have used to combat the occasional blemish. It doesn&#x27;t have benzoyl peroxide, so it won&#x27;t fade clothing. I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to spend a lot of time outside, but I am sure SPF will be needed along with this. It ends with a matte finish, but still moisturizes plenty. Skin isn&#x27;t flaky, or greasy either. Honestly everyones skin is different, and will react differently to different things, so your mileage may vary, but this just might worth trying.</li>
    <li> Works great. Reduce my acne in two days.</li>
    <li> This stuff was a lifesaver for awhile. I wore it in replacement of my standard face lotion and it certainly helped to clear up my face without drying it out. Unfortunately for me, about a couple months after use, my body grew immune to its wonderful effects and my acne came back. I have crazy acne so I assume this won&#x27;t happen to other people, but it was certainly effective while it lasted. I would definitely recommend this to people who have the issue of feeling &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; halfway through the day.</li>
    <li> This is the only face moisturizer that I can use without my skin feeling oily. I started buying it through Amazon because it&#x27;s a better deal than buying in stores, but also because my stores stopped carrying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very light, completely absorbs into your skin, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all. It definitely helps prevent breakouts on my skin.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of it and how effective it is!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for almost 2 years now and love it!! It is the first moisturizer that has consistently kept my skin clear. After I put it on, my skin feels fresh and clean! It is getting harder to find in stores...I really hope they don&#x27;t stop selling it!</li>
    <li> Alright, I&#x27;ll start by saying the con. I&#x27;m not too thrilled with how this stuff smells. Once it dries, though, it goes away completely. Onward to the pros! This stuff has a wonderfully smooth texture that goes on very evenly and there is no greasy residue either. This really does moisturize the skin while helping to alleviate redness and irritation. I haven&#x27;t seen my skin this clear since the fourth grade! I&#x27;m in complete love with this stuff and if salicylic acid works on your skin, you&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products and this product works.  It is gentle enough to be used everyday.  Fast Shipping.  3-pack is the best buy.</li>
    <li> This product made my face worst. All it did was moisturize. It mad me breakout and just wasn&#x27;t for me. Now their just collecting dust in the back of my bathroom cabinet. Not worth the price considering I had to buy 3 and not just 1. Very disappointing, but i&#x27;m sure it works for other people. Maybe not just great for my combination skin, so please beware.</li>
    <li> It dried up my skin more</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve have been using this product for over 2 months now and I am not disappointed at all! First off this is a pack of 3, I received these on March 8 and it&#x27;s May 23rd and I&#x27;m still on my first one so they last quite a bit. I only put it on in the morning but even if you put it on twice a day it should still last you quite awhile. I have had times where I have a few breakouts on my face and near the end of the day I can barely see them or they&#x27;ve gone down. Like any product if you use to much it will make things worst so when applying it to your face don&#x27;t over do it or your face will be a little greasy and your defeating the purpose of putting it on in the first place. Overall, it&#x27;s a great product and if you use it daily you won&#x27;t be disappointed. I will continue to use this as long as they sell this product.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS SNAKE OIL. Do not waste your money on this, this product made me breakout worse and did all of nothing to clear up or prevent any pimples. It feels barely noticeable when you put it on and your zits will not notice it is on your face either because they will still be on your face and worsen after you waste your money on this. I will say though I was sorry this did nothing helpful for me as I have had luck with other Neutrogena products, I did see results with the Neutrogena Naturals-- the scrub actually worked and reduced my breakouts and I will be switching back to the naturals line, I guess that is better suited for my skin type, but this rapid clear lotion just made matters worse for me and gave me a whole fun new set of those tiny annoying pimples. The Neutrogena Blemish concealer makeup stick is also a form of snake oil as they only give a tiny bit of product for you money, but it is the best blemish concealer I have ever used and does help make the pimple go away, just wish they gave you more product for the price. This defense lotion is just an all around waste of your money and time though, you better buy something else to offensively combat the acne that you will get from this &amp;#34;defense&amp;#34; pimple chaos causing lotion.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and such a deal for three. Walmart sells one for $10. This is a great deal and each were unopened.</li>
    <li> Been trying to find a replacement for Epiduo as I&#x27;m now &amp;#34;of age&amp;#34; in the US healthcare world and can no longer be under my parents insurance / I can&#x27;t afford a +$300 tube of Epiduo. Unfortunately, I guess since my skin has gotten used to a strong prescription drug, this Neutrogena product has not been able to do much to control my breakouts. I&#x27;ve been using it before bed, and right after I wash my face in the morning for the past month and not much improvement. Looks like I&#x27;ll need to find something stronger.</li>
    <li> Maybe its just me. I have occasional breakouts due to stress and thought this would help stave those off... not so much. My breakouts somehow got about 10 times worse when I started using this,plus my skin got all flakey. I&#x27;m not a fan.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this.  She said it makes her skin brighter and clearer than any other product.</li>
    <li> lotion leaves your skin hydrated while fighting acne...love this stuff</li>
    <li> This was horrible the next morning after using it I broke out 10 times worse, deff think this is the worst product</li>
    <li> This product seems to be effective in keeping my skin clear, but it also dries out my skin a bit. I only use it at night.</li>
</ol>
