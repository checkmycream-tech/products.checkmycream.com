<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really like these brushes! They are very soft and come with every brush you will need: They had a funny spell when I first received them, kind of a strong paint smell. Cleaned them and they are fine now. Also my set only had 31 brushes. They must have forgotten one, but there are so many others, I&#x27;m not really concerned. other than that, great purchase! Especially for the money!</li>
    <li> Very good quality, my wife is happy with it,i recommend it</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! use them everyday. They&#x27;re so soft! The case kinda smelled like paint but the brushes are perfect!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for about a month now and I just love them! The hairs are so soft and gentle on my skin. With everyday use no hairs have fallen out and they are easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I didn&#x27;t like the smell (paint thinner) when the package first came but that disappeared within a couple weeks so it&#x27;s fine now. Another con is the brushes don&#x27;t have the brush names on them (I&#x27;m not a professional so I don&#x27;t know all the different names and uses for each brush). I wish they would label the brushes. They do include a link to there website where you can identify the brushes and I just used a sharpie to label them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though these are fantastic especially for the price. I wasn&#x27;t expecting such an amazing product since the other brush sets I looked at were around $75-$100. Definitely recommend these brushes!</li>
    <li> Using these brushes for a production of  &amp;#34;Into The Woods&amp;#34; and the cast LOVES these brushes!!</li>
    <li> The brushes are very soft &amp; nice but the package they come in has a strong plastic smell that lasts a week or so... The brushes hold eyeshadow nicely but some do not. Maybe I was using the wrong one or something because it wasn&#x27;t holding it on there &amp; also it was going below my eye too.  I have yet to use the others for blush or products like that because I mainly bought them for eyeshadow use. I have to say they work fairly well for that &amp; you can&#x27;t beat the quantity or the price!</li>
    <li> Loved my new set of brushes. Good quality for a great price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a gift for a friend so I&#x27;m not sure how good it is since I don&#x27;t usually put on make up. But the shipping was fast and the brushes seem of high quality.</li>
    <li> I love it. Happy I ordered</li>
    <li> High quality. Gf loves it!!</li>
    <li> I bought this set as a gift &amp; she loves them... They look fantastic &amp; she is very pleased...</li>
    <li> They are realy nice i love them</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with these bushes!!</li>
    <li> You get what you paid for, it does the job for the price. Many variety of brushes but it&#x27;s not good quality, the bristles are not strong but gets the job done, I would grade it 76%</li>
    <li> Brought brush from makeup company before and have been disappointed. But these were very nice. Each brush seems substantial went being in use. Adhesive between fibers and stem seem strong and no loosening is feel between the two when held. Im a makeup artist so it nice to have a, nice set that didnt cost a lot of money. Would buy more from this company.</li>
    <li> everything i expected and more for a very low price. i am so impressed with these brushes and how soft they are. if you are on the fence about buying these— get them. you wont regret it.</li>
    <li> Great set of brushes. Love the feel of them and they&#x27;re perfect for doing my make up for drag and theatre.</li>
    <li> I loved the product. I will definitely recommend it to family and friends</li>
    <li> This brush set is so perfect!! It has all the brushes I need and it even has a few extra pockets so that I was able to add a few of my existing brushes to the collection &amp; the bag is the icing on the cake for travel and fast clean-up. I LOVED how each brush has its own plastic cover which I&#x27;m keeping on them so that the makeup won&#x27;t dirty the bag-love!! Thank you! The brushes are very good quality and I would order again if I needed to! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are a great deal, great price and the quality is excellent. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in this product.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift. The person loved it! Brushes are very soft.</li>
    <li> These are great brushes.  Very soft and no bristles fall off.  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> best thing i have ever bought of amazon</li>
    <li> Great set for beginners! Has everything I needed to get started plus some options to grow into. No issues with stray hairs after washing.</li>
    <li> Excellent product brushes are professionally made.</li>
    <li> I bought this particular set of 32 brushes about a month from now on a friend’s suggestion and I am indeed reaping the seeds of that!!...i think it is a great product!</li>
    <li> The best makeup brushes I have bought. They don&#x27;t shed plus they&#x27;re vegan which is always awesome!</li>
    <li> They shipped really fast. The quality is amazing, the bristles are extremely soft. The brushes had a slight smell right out of the package, but one wash removed the smell completely!</li>
    <li> Perfect, every brush that you need, good quality too</li>
    <li> If you love doing make up or are adding to your pro collection these are it!! I really like my new brushes. Great price, quantity and quality. The only downfall is the brush organizer case has a strong order so I left it out to air for a while before rolling it up and storing it</li>
    <li> This was a good buy. I was pleased with the quality and the amount of brushes for the low price. I needed a new extra back up set of brushes for a very large wedding party I was doing a make up job for. And I needed them asap. I received them quick and they came packaged pretty well. Each brush individually wrapped. There were several of the brushes that were similar in size and shape so there could have been a little more variety for different uses, but that&#x27;s my only complaint so far. Like I said, great quality for the price!</li>
    <li> It arrived in perfect condition.  The brushes are very soft and easy to clean.  I loved it.</li>
    <li> Brushes are great got them faster than I expected. Make up stays on great I would recommend</li>
    <li> very good brushes havent had any problems!</li>
    <li> GREAT quality. No shedding. The only issue is they had a weird smell.</li>
    <li> I know I&#x27;ll have everything I need when I&#x27;m on location or doing an event. Love this set!</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift for one of my daughters. So far she loves them.</li>
    <li> Good quality. The bag the come with is cheesy, but the brushes are good.</li>
    <li> This set has been even  better than my Mac set so far , I would highly recommend 😘</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes to add to my brush collection, but after using them, I haven&#x27;t gone back to any of my old brushes. These are a great variety for all my makeup needs. So inexpensive compared to my other brushes, but still great quality</li>
    <li> impressed by the packaging, love the variety</li>
    <li> Amazing quality brushes! They are super soft and the handles are very sturdy. the only complaint I have is that the pouch they come in has a slight odor, but it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! They are soft and do not fall apart. I just did about a dozen girl&#x27;s makeup for prom and they worked wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I have seen these brushes bring smiles and great times to a bunch of people now, she uses them for face painting. Easy to clean, holds plenty of pigment, zero irritation on everyone from young to old. Honestly couldn&#x27;t ask for much better for faces.&lt;br /&gt;I do not get the whole &#x27;Vegan&#x27; thing because synthetic is more appropriate, but hey, if a single word helps sell something, go for it!</li>
    <li> My Wife LOVES these brushes!!! Great quality at a great price! Thanks</li>
    <li> There great fir a starter set</li>
    <li> Great brushes! and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> An amazing set for any girl or woman who aims for beauty</li>
    <li> Love the variety of brushes. Cant wait to use them.</li>
    <li> Love it! They are smooth and helps me do what I want with the make up.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes!!! I have already told several people about them and even had them feel them. I told them exactly where to go and told them to remember the name-Karity Cosmetics!</li>
    <li> Loved these and ended up buying for a few close friends. No shedding. Only issue is when folded the case creases a few bushes so u have to store carefully</li>
    <li> Great set it definitely helps in creating a flawless look.</li>
    <li> I love my brushes I ordered two more for my daughters.</li>
    <li> I loved this product! Such a great price and my brushes are soft and amazing. Definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for affordable brushes.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. They are fluffy and soft . a lot of brush sets I found have very stiff brushes, these aren&#x27;t. They are perfect !</li>
    <li> The brush kit came complete and comprehensive, with every brush you could want for your makeup. That said the brushes themselves are okay, they do have an intense odor upon opening and some bristles come off upon face application like the foundation brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I bought them primarily for the vegan and eco-friendly factor and the extensiveness of the kinds of brushes.</li>
    <li> These are great. I bought them months ago and they are still in tact. They did smell funny when I first bought them however after using brush wash that smell went away</li>
    <li> This package arrived really fast. The smell of the package was quite strong but if locked away somewhere it&#x27;s not so bad. The brushes were great and it&#x27;s really cool how many there are!</li>
    <li> I am in loooove with my brushes!!! They came in a day earlier than expected all 32 brushes arrived and they are really good quality. I highly recommend these brushes if you&#x27;re unsure, get them. You won&#x27;t regret it I promise..only bad thing I have to say about them is the packaging smells really strongly of paint but leave them out 2 air out and they r fine! Will def. order from them again!</li>
    <li> Item delivered fast and well packed. The case smelt like plastic (it is plastic) but went away after a couple of days. Brushes are soft and so far do not shed. Great purchase for the price.</li>
    <li> These brushes are soft and functional! Love them!</li>
    <li> Product comes packaged really nicely. There really are more brushes than I ever need for daily makeup, but for the price you really can&#x27;t be the quality of these brushes. Great quality and very affordable!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girl she&#x27;s happy which that&#x27;s good, quality are good and so far she likes them...</li>
    <li> Great gift for any female in ur life</li>
    <li> My wife likes them. She said it&#x27;s a good quality product and the feel it&#x27;s like the professional sets.</li>
    <li> I was at first a bit cynical about this product since I had used such types of brushes earlier but none of the experiences were good enough but this one is indeed different!!</li>
    <li> I love them they came in on Thursday like expected I&#x27;m new to makeup brushes and so I&#x27;m going to learn but the are soft didn&#x27;t really have a smell like everyone else said.</li>
    <li> Good brushes expect I didn&#x27;t recieve all 32 of them</li>
    <li> Love my Karity brushes, really soft bristles and does its job really well. Oh and affordable too! I&#x27;m a happy customer. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s very sad that after reading all 13 reviews it appears that only 1 is legitimate. A few are even duplicates - comments are verbatim yet from different &amp;#34;users&amp;#34;. Completely deterred me from buying this product.</li>
    <li> Granddaughter is trying theatrical make up says it was just what she needed</li>
    <li> I was kind of worried i was not going to like the brissels because the photo of them look hard, but once i got them, I am in love with them. I will never buy any other type.</li>
    <li> Nice brushes. I wish each one had a number on it but the website is pretty good at helping sort them out. I already have my favorites. They don&#x27;t shed and look really nice in a short case on my vanity.</li>
    <li> Such a great product! I like the fact that it has its own case. Will buy from them again. Everything is as described. Very professional.</li>
    <li> feels very professional. brushes are good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> This set is great!  No mess every bit of powder stays on the brush.  Extremely pleased with this purchase.</li>
