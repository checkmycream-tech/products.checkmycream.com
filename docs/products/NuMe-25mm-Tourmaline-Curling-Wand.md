### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I bought this curling iron because of a deal, and also because sometimes I just need a touch up or need to curl my hair faster than what it takes to use the rollers and this curling iron is awesome.  </li>
      <li>However, I can&#x27;t always get the tip of my hair to get that perfect twist</li>
      <li>:D</li>

      <li>This wand is amazing and fool proof.</li>
      <li>I was expecting something amazing from this iron, all I got was a smelly room (from the iron heating) and smelly hair that is curled, but there has got to be something better.</li>
      <li>Great product, very fast delivery</li>
      <li>I am notorious for not being able to do my hair.</li>
      <li>And I have used SO many curling wands, irons, rollers, etc.</li>
      <li>I love the way they curl my hair and get lots of compliments.  </li>
      <li>But after four months of having the wand, smoke started pouring out between the buttons and the handle heats up to the point of not being able to hold it even with the glove on.</li>
      <li>I really love this curler.  </li>
      <li>I cant wait to try their blow dryer &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>and the high price made me think it must be good.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this curling wand, it is sooo much easier to use than the tradition curling irons.</li>
      <li>it feels cheap</li>
      <li>I love this tool, and I think it is worth it</li>
      <li>Fortunately I purchased through amazon prime and had no issues with returning it.</li>
      <li>It does heat up very quickly and very hot.</li>
      <li>Thank you for such good customer service.</li>
      <li>However, this tool makes it impossibly quick for me to curl my hair.  </li>
      <li>Makes your hair super shiny as well.</li>
      <li>However there are many pros to this particular one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It gets very, very HOT, very, very fast!</li>
      <li>Super fun and efficient to use.</li>
      <li>But, I was just able to create an actual full curly style!</li>
      <li>Not to mention it is pretty humid right now in NC!</li>
      <li>MakeupAlley had a few codes to get great discounts from their site.</li>
      <li>Worked great for a few months.</li>
      <li>It should also have a ready light indicator.  </li>
      <li>It curls nicely, but I&#x27;d imagine any product with the same shape could do so.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need temperatures any where near that hot to curl most hair types so variable heat should have been included on this wand.  </li>
      <li>This iron heats up fast and works on my super thick/hard to style hair.</li>
      <li>It was the exact curling wand she wanted.</li>
      <li>I had a hot tools wand that I used most often and had been wanting a NuMe wand for a LONG time, and when I found a coupon for $115 off, I GOT IT!</li>
      <li>It gives me beautiful wavy curls, that are pretty much the same if not better than using the hot rollers, and it is faster.  </li>
      <li>it comes in pink :)</li>
      <li>This curling iron is listed at $135 on the NuMe website but can be found for a much nicer cost here on Amazon.&lt;br</li>
      <li>heats up very quickly&lt;</li>
      <li>You can certainly buy this product for about 40 dollars when you find a 100 dollar coupon online, so there might be other better places to buy it.  </li>
      <li>recommend that you use the heat resistant glove that comes with it, especially if you are new to using this type of an iron, because it is quite easy to burn yourself if you don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I normally use hot rollers, which do work really well, but often have a small kink at the top of the curl because of the clamp I use to keep the roller in until it cools.</li>
      <li>this particular wand about twice a week.  </li>
      <li>It gets hot fast, but I haven&#x27;t experienced any bad smell or burning of my hair.  </li>
      <li>It heats up quickly, is easy to use, &amp; gives amazingly long lasting results with no crimping on the ends like the tradition curling iron with a clip.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so used to being able to return everything I didn&#x27;t look into it before I placed the order, and I guess I thought how could I not love it.</li>
      <li>The hot tools wand curled my hair fine, but it was too thick</li>
      <li>I curl my hair often, I have noraml hair, straight and normal, not thin or super thick.</li>
      <li>and it takes a little bit to really fine tune which way to hold the wand</li>
      <li>Not only do I NOT need hair spray or mouse to keep the curl, but it can hold in good condition for at least two days!</li>
      <li>I find that it makes my hair much shinier than my Hottools regular curling iron (with a clip that I don&#x27;t use during the process).  </li>
      <li>my hair still looks and feels soft.  </li>
      <li>So I went with the 19mm HOT PINK wand.</li>
      <li>IF U REALIZED THAT AFTER BUYING IT, U CANNOT RETURN IT!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;BE CAREFUL AND BE AWARE OF IT</li>
      <li>I was so excited when I saw this product, and I found a coupon bringing the price down to only 50 dollars.</li>
      <li>The temperature is 410 with no other options.  </li>
      <li>I got it within 2 days of ordering and early enough to use it before doing a cover on YouTube (SUBSCRIBE!</li>
      <li>The company is sketchy, I&#x27;m usually good with seeing that and doing my research, but I thought this was the only place that had a wand (didn&#x27;t do too much research &#x3D;( )</li>
      <li>Apparently Nume will only replace their faulty products if you pay them to do so, plus shipping.  </li>
      <li>I have done this same type of curl with my regular clamp curling iron (just leaving it closed and wrapping around) and it worked very well, and did not singe my hair.</li>
      <li>It was no light to indicate it being on or hot enough or anything.</li>
      <li>I have super thick hair</li>

<li> It was no light to indicate it being on or hot enough or anything.</li>
<li> I have super thick hair</li>
<li> I also plugged in my flat iron.  </li>
<li> I thought I might have just not let it heat up long enough</li>
<li> I have been through dozens of curling irons, my hair falls flat, sometimes within minutes.</li>
<li> My curls last with this, then turns into loose waves that stay until i wash them out.</li>
<li> I only held it on the curler for 8-10 seconds (because holding it for less wasn&#x27;t curling my hair)</li>
<li> I was a bit clumsy with it at first when trying to get used to twirling my hair around the wand, but you get the hang of it after a few minutes.</li>
<li> there is no changeable heat setting (I never use this on other hair products</li>
<li> #60;1w, I&#x27;de been warned about this by other reviews.</li>
<li> It does not have heat settings, it is so hot, my poor hair smells burnt!</li>
<li> Yesterday, I was using it and it started to lose heat and eventually cooled all the way down.  </li>
<li> I have fairly long hair--it goes halfway down my back--and this cuts down the time I take to style my thick, voluminous hair.  </li>
<li> so I waited a little longer and it didn&#x27;t work that time either.</li>
<li> It smells when it heats up, and I&#x27;m afraid I really singed my hair.</li>
<li> The Amazon price is pretty much impossible to beat.</li>
<li> I have highlighted hair that usually (prob because of the damage from highlighting hehe) keeps curled for quite a bit.</li>
<li> THIS IS NOT A SAFE PRODUCT FOR U, AND</li>
<li> I have a feeling that the NuMe company is sketchy about it because they know their irons are not very good.</li>
<li> The 3ed time the heating element had a melt down, it was a little scary</li>
<li> The only bad things that I can say about it are that there is no light indicating whether it is on or off, &amp; there also is no temp.</li>
<li> NuMe works like a charm, just wear the glove and work slowly.</li>
<li> Not good.</li>
<li> I have hair that is very hard to keep curled.</li>
<li> Usually all the other irons I used after about 30 minutes my hair would die and look like crap.</li>
<li> However, the reason I am giving them a one is because their warranty is AWFUL.</li>
<li> Terrible customer service.</li>

    <li> This was a great product, the 2 times I used it. The 3ed time the heating element had a melt down, it was a little scary and I had had it for &amp;#60;1w, I&#x27;de been warned about this by other reviews. Fortunately I purchased through amazon prime and had no issues with returning it.</li>
    <li> HEY PEOPLE,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;yeah, it does curls, and keeps the hair shiny, BUT,THERE IS NO CUSTOMER SERVICE TO CONTACT WITH, No information for RETURNS!!!&lt;br /&gt;SO,IF U FEEL THIS IS NOT A SAFE PRODUCT FOR U, AND IF U REALIZED THAT AFTER BUYING IT, U CANNOT RETURN IT!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;BE CAREFUL AND BE AWARE OF IT COZ REPRESENTATIVES ALSO DONT TELL U THIS DETAIL!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I saw this product, and I found a coupon bringing the price down to only 50 dollars. I used it the night I got it in the mail. It does heat up very quickly and very hot. It was no light to indicate it being on or hot enough or anything. It smells when it heats up, and I&#x27;m afraid I really singed my hair. I curl my hair often, I have noraml hair, straight and normal, not thin or super thick. I only held it on the curler for 8-10 seconds (because holding it for less wasn&#x27;t curling my hair) It does not have heat settings, it is so hot, my poor hair smells burnt! Not good. I have done this same type of curl with my regular clamp curling iron (just leaving it closed and wrapping around) and it worked very well, and did not singe my hair. I was expecting something amazing from this iron, all I got was a smelly room (from the iron heating) and smelly hair that is curled, but there has got to be something better. The company is sketchy, I&#x27;m usually good with seeing that and doing my research, but I thought this was the only place that had a wand (didn&#x27;t do too much research &#x3D;( ) and the high price made me think it must be good. I definitely am going to try to send it back...I have a feeling that the NuMe company is sketchy about it because they know their irons are not very good. I&#x27;m so used to being able to return everything I didn&#x27;t look into it before I placed the order, and I guess I thought how could I not love it. I was duped. So please, order a different wand from a different company!!</li>
    <li> It came on time. I gave it as a gift. The person was very pleased with it. It was the exact curling wand she wanted. Thank you for such good customer service.</li>
    <li> Great product, very fast delivery</li>
    <li> I have been through dozens of curling irons, my hair falls flat, sometimes within minutes. This NuMe curling wand is amazing!! My curls last until the next morning, with zero hair product!! Makes your hair super shiny as well. I cant wait to try their blow dryer &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Bear in mind that you&#x27;re paying $60 for a curling wand-it&#x27;s not going to give you the world. However there are many pros to this particular one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. heats up very quickly&lt;br /&gt;2. the curls last FOREVER&lt;br /&gt;3. it comes with an awesome glove-unlike others it doesn&#x27;t make my hair staticy when I try to separate it&lt;br /&gt;4. the curls last FOREVER&lt;br /&gt;5. it comes in pink :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are cons though, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. there is no changeable heat setting (I never use this on other hair products though)&lt;br /&gt;2. it feels cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think those are the only cons. I don&#x27;t notice the smell, as another reviewer said. I think this is great for the money.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this curling wand, it is sooo much easier to use than the tradition curling irons. It heats up quickly, is easy to use, &amp; gives amazingly long lasting results with no crimping on the ends like the tradition curling iron with a clip. My curls keep their bounce for two days. The only bad things that I can say about it are that there is no light indicating whether it is on or off, &amp; there also is no temp. control. The Amazon price is pretty much impossible to beat. This curling iron is listed at $135 on the NuMe website but can be found for a much nicer cost here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend that you use the heat resistant glove that comes with it, especially if you are new to using this type of an iron, because it is quite easy to burn yourself if you don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can deff. recommend this to anybody looking for beautiful curls/waves.</li>
    <li> NuMe works like a charm, just wear the glove and work slowly. It gets very, very HOT, very, very fast!</li>
    <li> I have read these reviews and can&#x27;t help but wonder how in the world they can say these things. I have super thick hair that&#x27;s been colored ALOT and goes further than my boulder blades... And I have used SO many curling wands, irons, rollers, etc. you name it, I&#x27;ve used it! I had a hot tools wand that I used most often and had been wanting a NuMe wand for a LONG time, and when I found a coupon for $115 off, I GOT IT! The hot tools wand curled my hair fine, but it was too thick and I wanted tighter curls... So I went with the 19mm HOT PINK wand. I got it within 2 days of ordering and early enough to use it before doing a cover on YouTube (SUBSCRIBE! Hollyjo7411) :D I slept on it that night, wore it up the next day at work, came home and brushed it and it was still beautifully wavy and shiny. Not to mention it is pretty humid right now in NC! So, anyone who is thinking of buying this and is still reading this review... Stop wasting time, and go get your NuMe wand!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am notorious for not being able to do my hair. I have tried numerous curlers and straighteners in hope for creating a style- no luck. But, I was just able to create an actual full curly style! This wand is amazing and fool proof.</li>
    <li> I have the Nume Curl Jam, Nume Pearl and the Nume reverse wand.  I love the way they curl my hair and get lots of compliments.  However, the reason I am giving them a one is because their warranty is AWFUL. I bought the Curl Jam just three months ago.  I this particular wand about twice a week.  Yesterday, I was using it and it started to lose heat and eventually cooled all the way down.  I thought maybe a fuse was out and checked that.  Nope.  I also plugged in my flat iron.  Everything worked so I contacted NUME to tell them of the problem.  Apparently Nume will only replace their faulty products if you pay them to do so, plus shipping.  I checked the site and it said it had a 4 year warranty.  So buyer beware.  their warranty is that if they send you a faulty product, you get to pay for it again.</li>
    <li> Love this wand! My curls last with this, then turns into loose waves that stay until i wash them out. I don&#x27;t even use hairspray with it and they stay. Love the titanium wands too! MakeupAlley had a few codes to get great discounts from their site.</li>
    <li> Great curling iron. I have hair that is very hard to keep curled. Usually all the other irons I used after about 30 minutes my hair would die and look like crap. Not only do I NOT need hair spray or mouse to keep the curl, but it can hold in good condition for at least two days! VERY pleased with this curling irom.</li>
    <li> This iron heats up fast and works on my super thick/hard to style hair. I was a bit clumsy with it at first when trying to get used to twirling my hair around the wand, but you get the hang of it after a few minutes.</li>
    <li> You can certainly buy this product for about 40 dollars when you find a 100 dollar coupon online, so there might be other better places to buy it.  However, this tool makes it impossibly quick for me to curl my hair.  I have fairly long hair--it goes halfway down my back--and this cuts down the time I take to style my thick, voluminous hair.  It might take me 15-20 minutes from start to finish (hairspray etc.).  I find that it makes my hair much shinier than my Hottools regular curling iron (with a clip that I don&#x27;t use during the process).  I love this tool, and I think it is worth it the money you pay.</li>
    <li> Super fun and efficient to use.</li>
    <li> Worked great for a few months. But after four months of having the wand, smoke started pouring out between the buttons and the handle heats up to the point of not being able to hold it even with the glove on. After being hung up on twice, I finally got through to customer service, which explained that after 90 days, it costs $30 to replace a $180 dollar curling iron. Terrible customer service. They don&#x27;t stand by their products whatsoever. Avoid these curling wands.</li>
    <li> I have highlighted hair that usually (prob because of the damage from highlighting hehe) keeps curled for quite a bit. I normally use hot rollers, which do work really well, but often have a small kink at the top of the curl because of the clamp I use to keep the roller in until it cools. I bought this curling iron because of a deal, and also because sometimes I just need a touch up or need to curl my hair faster than what it takes to use the rollers and this curling iron is awesome.  It gives me beautiful wavy curls, that are pretty much the same if not better than using the hot rollers, and it is faster.  However, I can&#x27;t always get the tip of my hair to get that perfect twist but I just have to pull the tip closer to the wand. It gets hot fast, but I haven&#x27;t experienced any bad smell or burning of my hair.  I wrap my hair around the wand and keep it there for 8-10 seconds and the curls last a heck of a lot longer than the rollers and I don&#x27;t have to use hairspray, so my hair still looks and feels soft.  I really love this curler.  I only gave the wand four stars because I dislike the fact that I have to use a glove to use the wand and it takes a little bit to really fine tune which way to hold the wand but I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> You&#x27;d think that for a wand that costs over a hundred smackers that it would have all the bells and whistles.  The temperature is 410 with no other options.  You don&#x27;t need temperatures any where near that hot to curl most hair types so variable heat should have been included on this wand.  It should also have a ready light indicator.  It curls nicely, but I&#x27;d imagine any product with the same shape could do so.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product from Nume&#x27;s online website. When I tried to curl my hair using the product it would not curl. I thought I might have just not let it heat up long enough so I waited a little longer and it didn&#x27;t work that time either. I would not suggest buying this product.</li>
