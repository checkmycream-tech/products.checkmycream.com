<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Received in good conditions.</li>
    <li> I have found this product to be very nice for the scalp. This web provider was very dependable and responsive.</li>
    <li> For starters, this is just hte &amp;#34;conditioner&amp;#34; part of a 3 part Nioxin Hair treatment system. They say it simply makes your hair look fuller, but I can see whole patches that were smooth shiny skin that since starting this 16 months ago, are now full of hair. I need to get my wife to take some &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; pics... I gladly suggest you try it. BUt do the whole system, not just one part.</li>
    <li> Great price for the size of bottle. This helps regrow hair and also makes it feel much fuller.</li>
    <li> As I bounce around various styling salons, Nioxin products always receive great endorsements from the stylists and satisfied customers...I have been one of those smiling customers for the last three years!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 3 months now.  I see a very little new growth.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to be working like I expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this product is just as good as the shampoo but I made a mistake when I bought it, I thought it was the shampoo but it&#x27;s the conditioner but since it&#x27;s my fault, I guess I&#x27;ll have to find someone who uses conditioner and give it to them.</li>
    <li> I use this item regularly and love the results. Works great in conjunction with the scalp treatment.</li>
    <li> I may be an exception to the rule but literally days after using Nioxin Shampoo my hair loss literally STOPPED ! No more hair in the bathub drain . That was 5-6 years ago and I am still enjoying the results! Also , I only used the product for a short while and today I am still not losing hair. I am going to make some more purchases anyways and the shampoo does feel good too . I did not grow back any hair and did not expect to either . I could kiss someone for this product !&lt;br /&gt;Frank Laughton, 44240</li>
    <li> I find that Nioxin 4 helps not so much with the actual hair loss, but there is a significant improvement in the texture of my hair.  I probably will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been in need of something to help me with my thinning hair but stayed away from Nioxin because I thought (for some reason) that even though it may help with hair growth--it may not leave my hair looking good. The truth is my hair is super soft and looks great ever since I started with this product. Although I bought it to help thicken my mane, I&#x27;ll keep using it whether that part of it works or not. It&#x27;s just really nice. And I love the peppermint smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(NOTE: if it works and helps me grow thicker hair--I&#x27;ll revise and give it the 5th star it will truly deserve! The jury&#x27;s just still out on that one.)</li>
    <li> Nioxilways a reliable product.  Buying it in the AAmazon system is the best way to get the best value!  I will reorder and reorder again!</li>
    <li> I had always had really long, thick hair. As I got into my mid-upper 20&#x27;s, I noticed that it was thinning out significantly and breaking off. All the sudden I had shoulder length thin, brittle hair. I was devastated. A friend of mine suggested Nioxin. I started using it and within a couple months my hair was growing like crazy! It&#x27;s really thick and long again! My hair stylist and all my friends are always commenting on my hair now. I can&#x27;t recommend Nioxin enough!!</li>
    <li> Considering that I had a bald patch the size of a softball on the top of my head, and after 2 months, it was gone--I&#x27;d say you cannot go wrong with this product.  It performs better than promised.  My hair texture and thickness improved by leaps and bounds.  Now I just use it to maintain a normal head of hair.  When I stop using it, the hair starts thinning immediately, so I know it&#x27;s this therapy that&#x27;s keeping the hair where it belongs, on my head, not in my hairbrush. btw the large size lasts a long time, because you only use a small pea-sized bit.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a slowing of hair loss and an improvement in scalp health since using the product.  I use both the shampoo and the scalp therapy.  Don&#x27;t expect results overnight.  I noticed a difference after about 6 weeks of continuous use.</li>
    <li> After a very stressful life event, putting my beloved dog to sleep, my hair began to fall out. Both my sister and my husband made comments about the back of my scalp showing. I immediatly got on Amazon and ordered Nioxin 4 Cleanser and the Conditioner, for fine and colored hair.  Amazon Prime membership has it&#x27;s benefits, both products arrived in 2 days. I have been using both products for over a month. The Cleanser/Shampoo does a wonderful job of cleaning my hair. It is somewhat drying but the use of the conditioner moisturizes my hair to a shiny, soft, fluffy style that covers my scalp.  I am very happy with both Nioxin products. I also see tiny new hairs growing where my scalp was showing. I will continue to wash my hair every other day with Nioxin and update this review after 6 months.</li>
    <li> My physician suggested I try this product to stop my hair loss and hair thinning and to promote faster regrowth.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 3 weeks and am not sure that&#x27;s long enough to see real progress -- it&#x27;s for that reason that I gave this 4 stars rather than 5.  Aside from that, I love the product.  I love the way it makes my scalp tingle in the shower and the way my hair feels fuller after each shampoo.  I do see some new hair growth where there was none before, and the tingling makes me hopeful that it will continue.  The nice smell is a bonus.  The product is pricey, but it&#x27;s a large bottle and should last a good while -- besides, the cost is worth it if it reduces my hair thinning.  So far, the signs look good!</li>
    <li> When I received this product, it was in a box way too big &amp; it had leaked all over the box.  I sent a complaint right away and never heard back.  Very disappointed in this company &amp; AMAZON for the lack of response.  I know this was a while ago, but I just had another item sent that was damaged &amp; I came across the photos I took of this order--and realized there hadn&#x27;t been any resolution.</li>
    <li> Maybe not quite as good, but it certainly keeps down the frizz, especially when it is humid outside. I will absolutely keep using this Nioxin scalp therapy. Both the &amp;#34;3&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;4&amp;#34; work well for me.</li>
    <li> Great product, love it ^_^</li>
    <li> Wow:)  happy for that price I would pay that price for half that size... I truly Believe that this product really works because I  was thinning in the top of my head from over process.. But u can not see the bold spot any more.. I will keep using this..</li>
    <li> I buy it for my husband whose hair is thinning significantly.  It really makes a difference how his hair looks and seems to have slowed down the thinning process.</li>
    <li> helps the texture of hair, but has not caused any new growth after years&#x27; of use</li>
    <li> My wife reorders this all the time. The only thing she says that doesn&#x27;t take the color out of her hair.</li>
    <li> Nioxin products have saved my extra fine thinning hair. The scalp therapy nourishes the scalp and helps you keep the hair you have. No longer have any hair in my comb and brush! Make sure to buy the full Nioxin System 4 products for these results. They work best in conjunction with one another. I have used Nioxin System 4 for a year and a half and my hair has filled back in and is growing again! Highly recommend if you want to stop any more hair loss.</li>
    <li> Makes my fine hair look and feel fuller. My hairdresser even noticed without me telling her. definitely recommend this stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand of shampoo &amp; conditioner for a couple of years with great results.... I was thrilled to find it on Amazon at less than half the price I have Ben paying. Great product and great price ..... what&#x27;s not to love?!</li>
    <li> I have used the various \\&quot;systems\\&quot; for the past 10 years. While it&#x27;s never going to make the lost hair grow back, it does seem to slow down the thinning.&lt;br /&gt;Using it regularly, I see more hair left on my head and less on the shower drain.&lt;br /&gt;Even the wife notices the improvement!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser says my hair is getting thicker since Ive been using this product. Ill keep using it for sure.</li>
    <li> Nioxin works very well, my hair thickened after the first washing, this has to be either my third of fourth bottle I brought so far.</li>
    <li> Very good product, I&#x27;ve used system 3 for years and it seems to have stabilized the hair thinning, decided to try 4 now</li>
    <li> Have used these products before and they do help stimulate hair growth and health.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the cost.  Good to use all three products together.</li>
    <li> I heard about this product works well for women with thinning hair but never tried it until my hair began to thin out even more since turning 50.  I&#x27;ve had thin hair all my life and I&#x27;ve notice as I&#x27;ve aged, my hair has increasingly thinned out more.  After using this produce for over 3 months, I&#x27;ve notice less hair loss and stronger hair.  I recommend this product to any women who has thin hair or is suffering from hair loss.</li>
    <li> Makes you hair coarse.</li>
    <li> Good product--but it does tend to dry my hair...not sure if that&#x27;s going to help keep it!  So I use this and once a month I switch to a conditioning shampoo and conditioner..</li>
    <li> I was told about this by my sister and it really seems to work.get the condition to go with it they both make your head tingle and makes you hair look good.</li>
    <li> Great product for thinning colored hair.  My hairdresser even commented on how much better my hair looked. I really think it has helped thicken my thin spots.</li>
    <li> I love the Nioxin products.  They leave the hair healthy and shiny.  I finally started growing new hair after about 3 months.  I am not sure if this had to do with the Nioxin products or my change of diet.  I still love the products for giving me nice hair.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love Nioxion System 4!  And love the prices on Amazon!  I am fighting hair loss constantly with old age and nothing beats the three-part Nioxin system to combat hair loss.  Hair feels great and looks great.  You will see baby hairs coming up all over the place, but you really need all three parts of the system to get results.  I&#x27;ve tried to save money many times by leaving either the shampoo, conditioner or scalp treatment out, but it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Great with dry scalp to improve flaking. My hair now grows thicker and is healthier longer than it ever did before. To stretch the product I only use on scalp and root area then use another conditioner on ends.</li>
    <li> I have been using these products for several years.  I am diabetic and often my hair will fall out…using this product has always worked to help it grow back and thicken it up.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Best product on the market for slowing down &amp;#34;the ole hair falling out when showering!&amp;#34; The negative is once you start using this product you can not stop. So only use this product if you&#x27;re prepared to be addicted and pay around $30 every 6-12 months for a bottle. I think it&#x27;s worth it. This advice is backed by a well known hair transplant doctor I know.</li>
    <li> This is a must for my fine, thinning hair.  Anytime I go to a salon, I take my Nioxin products and ask the beautician to use them. Many salons have the Nioxin for sale in the shop.  The gals who cut and color my hair tell me I am using the best possible shampoo and conditioner that I could buy. I already knew that, but it&#x27;s nice to know professionals agree!</li>
    <li> The shampoo in the series always lasts, but the conditioner seems to fade away faster.  Best to double up on your quarts</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner (system 4) for about 4 months.  Though I&#x27;ve not seen any improvement in the amount of hair that is falling out, my hair has grown much faster.  It makes my hair soft, but not weighed down.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Have been using Nioxin for over a year now.&lt;br /&gt;My hairdresser said that after losing more than 30% of my hair that I am getting a lot of new growth.&lt;br /&gt;The menthol in this product makes it more tingly and less medicine- like.</li>
    <li> this stuff works. slowly but surely I am seeing a difference in my hair. I will keep using it and I love the way it smells.</li>
    <li> Giant ass bottle for the price! This is my first month trying this stuff and I call tell the difference, nothing too drastic or dramatic, but worth buying again.</li>
    <li> Great product. It was shipped fast and I am seeing results.</li>
    <li> I have been using the system for about 8 weeks and I don&#x27;t see any results.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I expected and I  will purchase again. I feel as though it leaves the hair very clean.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Takes a few months but my hair is much healthier.  Have used for 6 months and have seen much improvement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for quite some time and I believe it helps thinning hair when used regularly.  I would recommend it to anyone with thinning hair,</li>
    <li> I used many products before but did not work much until this line. I also use deep conditioning once a week which is also very important.</li>
    <li> great value fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Amazing price for quality shampoo!! I would have paid $50+ if I brought this at a salon!! Amazing deals for shampoo!!!</li>
    <li> Losing your hair is not fun or funny, this helps you keep it as long as possible. Good stuff just very hard to find.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! Very fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Love the feel of this shampoo, it leaves my hair feeling thicker.  Honestly have not used it that long yet, will be glad to review again, in a couple of months.</li>
    <li> Only product line that I use on my thinning hair.</li>
    <li> This did nothing for me after using it for a year. Stick to your regular shampoo and conditioner. This will not help your thinning hair, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> Great price! and delivery with quality as well.</li>
    <li> It took some time but I am finally showing some regrowth.  I love it!</li>
    <li> It takes a long time, but it seems to work</li>
    <li> Great price and very good product.  I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin for at least 10 years and am afraid to change since I haven&#x27;t lost much hair since using the product.  Amazon has the best prices for Nioxin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Nioxin in the past but always got lazy when I ran out because I can&#x27;t get it in my town.  Now that I can buy in on Amazon and in large quantities, I&#x27;ve been using it for a months and my hairdresser can tell that I&#x27;m getting new hair growth.  YAY!</li>
    <li> Product was received as advertised.  The large size available for this product makes it a very economical way to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Use this product often.  Everything was perfect.</li>
    <li> I am using Nioxin shampoo and conditioner with Rogaine foam. It made an immediate difference for me and that was the month before I started the Rogaine. A hairdresser I spoke with said that Nioxin is like that. If it does work for you it works good. Otherwise not much resultwise.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was immediately softer and gentler to the touch. It still is a bit frizzy and damaged but it has a lot of wear and tear in it. I know it feels good to touch my own hair for the first time in a long time and have it not feel so brittle and dry. Now just waiting to see if my hair takes to the Rogaine the same.</li>
    <li> A wonderful product that I have used and trusted now for years!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Well packaged to prevent damage. Works great on my hair. Half the price of local stores. Will continue to order as needed.</li>
    <li> I massage into my scalp to stimulate hair growth after shampooing. When I rinse it out, very little hair is shed. This is an excellent product for hormonal hair loss.</li>
    <li> Arrived sooner than promised and exactly as expected-thanks</li>
    <li> Great for thin hair like mine</li>
    <li> Wife loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had long enough to see how well it works, but am sure it will.  My husband says it works well for him per his barber.</li>
    <li> Nioxin works the best and is well worth the extra cost. If you have thinning hair, try Nioxin products!</li>
    <li> This works great on my hair.  Was recommended by my beautician and it seems to help me keep what I have.</li>
    <li> My scalp improved greatly with use of this product. My hair also seems healthier</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 5 years and it has made a huge difference. I am no longer loosing as much hair with each shampoo. Your prices are the best I have found.</li>
    <li> My husband has used this for a good while for thinning hair and I started using it for a change. My hair does better and is in better shape too. His hair has stopped thinning.</li>
    <li> This review is for: Nioxin Scalp Therapy, System 4 (Fine/Treated/Noticeably Thinning) / (Conditioner)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second purchase of a bottle this big from Amazon. Last week, my hairdresser actually commented on how much thicker my hair seems now. I am not kidding folks...this Nioxin System 4 is great shampoo/conditioner if you have fine, color treated, noticeably thinning hair! This product is also available for none color treated hair, I just don&#x27;t recall what system number it is.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Helps with thinning hair! I can see a difference already! If you haven&#x27;t tried it you should!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product along with the cleanser for a year now &amp; I actually noticed my hair is thicker, not brittle and more full. I&#x27;ve heard of it but was kinda skeptical at first, but it really is a miracle. I highly recommend this for everyone with fine hair &amp; problem with thinning...♥♥</li>
    <li> My hair is thinning due to age and hereditary. Plus not to mention coloring it for years.  I use Nioxin scalp treatment, cleanser,hair booster and scalp therapy. I had stopped using it saying my hair looked great and I didn&#x27;t need these products any longer.  I started to find strands of hair in the sink and shower. I only stopped for a week but it showed me these products work.</li>
    <li> I discontinued using after less than a month when my scalp got sores and bumps. I went on the FB Nioxin FB page and found a few othr customers with the same complaint. I have never had these bumps from anything else, and they&#x27;re still not gone after more than a month!  Even if my hair did somewhat stop thinning, I can&#x27;t use this!</li>
    <li> I love this as a conditioner. It makes my hair feel very soft. It&#x27;s supposed to help thinning hair but I&#x27;m not having much luck with that. I will continue using it though because it&#x27;s the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve used more than anyone i know.</li>
    <li> May not grow hair but sure slows the losing process. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and by now would probably have lost a lot more hair than I have.</li>
    <li> I love the Nioxin products.  The shampoo  makes your scalp tingle.  If you leave the conditioner on for a little longer it really works well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for 6 months with the conditioner. I have noticed a distinct difference in my hair and scalp. I am also noticing small new hair around the hairline. I have read some people don&#x27;t like the smell but I love it. Both the shampoo and conditioner last quite a while.  The smell - to my nose- is very herbal. It also has a cooling effect on my scalp.</li>
    <li> What can I say, we love Minecraft in our house. The toys are the perfect size for little hands and because everything is movable, my son gets to really enjoy them. The little accessory pieces fit perfectly into the characters hands and they are a perfect match in appearance to the ones on the game. Amazon had them for a great price and I was able to collect all of them, they are hard to find in the stores! Must have for fans, even I love them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s with male-pattern baldness in my family genes.  My wife is the one who turned me on to this product.  She experiences hair thinning issues as well.  I was skeptical when she said it slows hair loss... but, when I use it, I have less hair in the hair trap. When I don&#x27;t use it, more hair in hair trap.  That may or may not be a good scientific measurement of it&#x27;s effectiveness but for our household, we think it works great.  It obviously costs more than your usual drugstore products but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin shampoo, conditioner, and scalp treatment for almost a year, and my hair looks and feels so much fuller at the scalp level. I&#x27;m 47 and started to see thinning at my part on my scalp, and I was horrified. My hair stylist sister in law recommended this treatment over all others on the market, and within a week, it was working! It doesn&#x27;t grow new hair and doesn&#x27;t claim to be &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34;, but with the shampoo cleaning out the follicles, the conditioner bringing moisture in it&#x27;s own way, and the scalp treatment doing it&#x27;s job, I don&#x27;t see my widening part anymore, and I don&#x27;t feel my scalp when I touch the top of my head, rather only much thicker feeling hair. I won&#x27;t be without this ever again. I don&#x27;t even need to use it more than a few times a week! Such a huge bottle - it lasts forever.</li>
    <li> A friend gave me Nioxin for Christmas.  It is difficult to judge, but appears to be helping my thinning hair.</li>
    <li> This works wonders on my fine hair, leaves it feeling great and thicker than it normally does.  Gets my hair clean and smooth.</li>
    <li> I started using this particular line of Nioxin a couple of years ago, even before I started having any weaving done to my hair. I read numerous reviews of the product line here on Amazon: some were enthusiastic, some, just *meh*, some disdainful. However, it seemed like the preponderance of users/reviewers were happy and/or, still hopeful with results, so, I tried it -- and, I&#x27;ve kept using it since then and probably will continue.&lt;br /&gt;I think it may be better for my hair than other products -- or, than just *plain*, stock shampoos and conditioners one finds. I&#x27;ve also improved my protein intake, having begun and continuing with organic, spouted, raw protein powders daily, along w/other nutrition boosts, so, that, too, may be helping the lesser amount of hair loss I&#x27;m experiencing now. I&#x27;m not certain -- BUT, I&#x27;m going to keep on with this Nioxin line: can&#x27;t hurt and it may be part of what&#x27;s helping! Taking no chances!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  It has made my hair fuller and the scalp is almost non visable. I use it with every hair wash. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on behalf of my wife, who began losing CLUMPS of hair during and after menopause.  She has been using this conditioner for a few years now, and it has stopped her hair loss problem, except for what she had normally experienced prior to menopause.  She uses it in conjunction with the Nioxin cleanser (#4) product, but it is the Scalp Therapy that really seems to make the difference.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 5 years.  A few weeks ago I used something else because I ran out of this.  I noticed the difference, as did my hair stylist.  My hair was dry.</li>
    <li> This is re-purchase..really like this shampoo</li>
    <li> Excellent product and outstanding customer service.</li>
    <li> I like the way this product detangles my hair.  Works quickly, makes hair manageable and soft.  Sometimes I pair this up with other conditioners,</li>
    <li> I have been using Nioxin products for the past 2 years and love them.  I have not regrown hair but my hair is no longer falling out. Will continue to purchase Nioxin products as long as I see no more noticeable hair loss.</li>
    <li> It is not a product that make hair grow on a bald head. But I have noticed considerable difference in the health and thickness of my hair. Maybe it will keep my hair on my head longer.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe the difference in my hair &amp; scalp! I wish I would have known about this years ago!</li>
    <li> I love this product, it leaves my hair lovely and silky!..System 3 is good too!..but this is the best for thinning hair..like it says..awesome!</li>
    <li> Best product Ive found for my thin hair. It keeps my color in lock longer and my hair truly fills thicker and softer, even though I bring a flat iron or curlers to it everyday. Definitely worth the splurge.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Nioxin Scalp Therapy!!! I have used it for years. It does help thinning hair! I love the smell also. People always comment on how fresh my hair smells.  It is great to use when you shave your legs also. You don&#x27;t need much for that. It keeps my legs from drying out. Love it!! Recommend it highly!!!</li>
    <li> Am having good luck with this and the other 3 products from this company to thicken and grow hair.  However, this product leaked during shipment. Did not realize I could purchase these products from other than my beautician.  It makes them more affordable through Amazon.</li>
    <li> All I have used for over a year now and it really works!</li>
    <li> Use for thin hair. I clean hair from build-up.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THE SHAMPOO FOR 5 YEARS NOW  REALLY HELP IF U HAVE HAIR FALLING OUT</li>
    <li> This stuff works - Nioxin is the only product I have found to work for women.</li>
    <li> This system seems to be working for me. I already purchased the shampoo at the salon. This is a great price. I have noticed much less hair on the bathroom floor. It&#x27;s nice and light&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is that gnats seem to be attracted to it outside in the yard.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nioxin Cleanser and Conditioners for over 12 years and love them. They have kept the hair on my head, and even the bald spot on the crown of my head grew back in after only a year or so of use, and has stayed that way since. Great for anyone worried about balding or thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Have been using this shampoo (and conditioner) for years and I think it&#x27;s the best on the market.  A small amount of the shampoo cleans well and an equal amount of the condition provides all the conditioning you could possibly want.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product that more than meets expectations. I use the entire product line and it has revitalized my hair and made it strong, shiny and healthy. I can&#x27;t imagine using any other hair care product and am a true believer in Nioxin.</li>
    <li> Nioxin is a refreshing scalp treament. It also helps with itching scalp and conditions hair so you can comb through hair after use. It was received in excellent condition and within a week of ordering.</li>
    <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s and have been using this product for a while. I have noticed that the hair in the drain is less than before. I do use another conditioner as well due to the light formula of this one.</li>
    <li> Great  products! I was seriously losing my hair at a scary rapid rate and my hair is already fine &amp; thin. I had a grandmother, an aunt &amp; a sister suffer from baldness, they had some hair but very, very little. I&#x27;m not just fighting genetics but pre menopausal  as well, with a stressful job. I&#x27;ve started their line a long with the Hair Booster (LOVE this stuff) and scalp treatment. Not only has my hair loss stopped, but growing some back!  I will happily buy this line forever, I hope it works as well for you too.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It&#x27;s all I use.</li>
    <li> I used this product for over a year and love the results. Amazon has continued to offer the best price.</li>
    <li> Have only been using 2 weeks.  Thus far, no noticeable difference in the amount and/or quality of my hair.  THAT said:  wondering how all these rave reviewers have been getting this Conditioner to actually squeeze out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on all the rave reviews, with great hopes, I placed my order.  The first bottle I returned cuz I couldn&#x27;t get any to squeeze out of the bottle.  I assumed it must have been old stock that had just dried up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second bottle I got from Amazon Prime was only slightly better.  Using a funnel, overnight I was able to drip the Conditioner into another container I happened to have with a wide top screw top. Now I am able to scoop the Nioxin out of the jar with my finger and spread onto my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am happy with the way it smells, feels and massages into my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, if anyone else has encountered this problem, I&#x27;d appreciate any tips for getting the stuff out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I think this really helps my hair to be full, soft and yet not limp.</li>
    <li> One bottle was bent and fluid spilled out. It was packaged very poorly. I got less than I paid for.</li>
    <li> I noticed my hair was thinning above my temples. My sister recommended Nioxin.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I have noticed in the 4 months I have been using it is my hair is getting thinner. It does leave my hair soft and clean.</li>
    <li> My hair is quite thin and likes to fall out all over the place. I started using Nioxin and while it hasn&#x27;t gotten thicker, it has stopped falling out. I have been purchasing Nioxin at my local overpriced salon for months. I imagine if I keep using this I&#x27;ll be sporting the Bob Ross in a year or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nioxin has a nice minty smell and tingles your scalp when used. As far as the price goes, I was paying twice as much for a bottle half the size when I purchased locally. Yay for Amazon!</li>
    <li> it came to me within 4 days thats awsome this conditioner has a cool minty sensation and i really like it i will buy again</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. I have used it for the last 3 years and would not be without.  It is expensive, but when I find a special, I stock up.</li>
