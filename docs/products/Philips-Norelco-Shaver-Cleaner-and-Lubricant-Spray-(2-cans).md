      <li>IT IS STILL AVAILABLE!  </li>
      <li>Shavers got better, but spray is no improvement over water and brush.</li>
      <li>I think it helps the blades function better.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t use it any more</li>
      <li>It works well for its purpose...what more do you need to say about it.  </li>
      <li>Can you ask for more than that?</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was worthwhile buying it.</li>
      <li>They run better</li>
      <li>This product has restored his original blades!</li>

      <li>Finally, the Norelco product has a more pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean the shaver</li>
      <li>and it does a fantastic cleaning job too.</li>
      <li>keep the razor running smooth</li>
      <li>I have used both the Remmington and Norelco Shaver Lubricant and have found that the Norleco product is far superior to Remington&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>Thia works very well and is very easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Very economical way to keep shaver heads clean and lubricated.  </li>
      <li>The lubricant helped to restore the original speed of my shaver.</li>
      <li>When it does, it leaves hair and oil residue on the parts that are supposed to be clean.  </li>
      <li>Keeps the razor clean and lubricated</li>
      <li>Just spray doesn&#x27;t clean my shaver I still need a brush.</li>
      <li>soon ready for purcahsing a couple more cans.....</li>
      <li>This Norelco electric shaver cleaner spray arrived at my house very quickly, and was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>It was as advertised and arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>quick and ez cleaning solution for my electric razor</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately the old Norelco solution isn&#x27;t available any more.  </li>
      <li>It was delivered quickly.  </li>
      <li>Got a new Norelco shaver and wanted to maintain it in tip top shape, so I got some of their cleaner.  </li>
      <li>And it does not take very much spray to clean the electric razor.</li>
      <li>Shaver heads are costly, and I would rather spend money on fun things.</li>
      <li>I also found that spraying the shaver head with canned air prior to using the lubricant provides additional shaver head longevity and an even more comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>This works all right as a lubricant for my shaver, but I could not stand the perfumed odor</li>
      <li>works real well on my mustache electric shaver, keeps it clean and lubed without gumming up the works.</li>
      <li>I thought that when I ordered this, that it was to clean the whole shaver and not jut the heads.</li>
      <li>Stuff does what it says though--my shaves are much better than before, but getting the replacement heads was the major factor.</li>
      <li>This is a good product, but not worth the cost.</li>
      <li>It is a simple and easy to use way to clean my razor.</li>
      <li>very fast delivery.  </li>
      <li>, he has not needed to replace the original blades with the new ones we just bought.  </li>
      <li>I clean the razor every week and its like new for every use.</li>
      <li>I can tell that I am getting better shaves after using this product regularly.</li>
      <li>, I recommend it to all Norelco users and its not expensive</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell too pretty either.</li>
      <li>purchased for my husband to use with his expensive razor; he loves it and says it keeps the bladed smooth and working great.</li>
      <li>At first I was a doubter, but this product really works.</li>
      <li>Norelco&#x27;s lubricant does not leave a residue that I&#x27;ve seen with other brands, but instead leaves the shaver heads with a  light (non-viscous) coating that helps the heads glide smoothly across my skin.</li>
      <li>We have a drawer of dead shavers that we just don&#x27;t seem to be able to throw away!</li>
      <li>VERY WELL</li>
      <li>It works very well with no irritation at all.  </li>
      <li>AND AT A REASONABLE COST.  </li>
      <li>Make shaving much easier.  </li>
      <li>The price was reasonable and the service was as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ken</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Those who are not as sensitive to odors as I am will probably do OK with this, but I will have to go with a different brand.</li>
      <li>I was hesitant to use this stuff at first because I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t do a significantly helpful job on the recent models-</li>
      <li>I just use it once a week and it likes putting new blades in every week!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a really good product for your electric razors.  It really does prolong the life of the blades,(which cost almost as much as the razor itself) and a can lasts a really long time because you use very little at a time.  It&#x60;s hard to find in stores and it is such a must for electric razors.</li>
    <li> Anything that will prolong the life the shaver is a great idea to me.  We have a drawer of dead shavers that we just don&#x27;t seem to be able to throw away!</li>
    <li> Thia works very well and is very easy to apply. Good price on Amazon. I recommend, will buy again, and I hope this helps someone.</li>
    <li> Good stuff but not much is needed.  I wash my razor once a week, let it dry, and then use this, but buying two cans?  well, let&#x27;s say that I hope that I&#x27;ll live so long as to use both of them.    Stuff does what it says though--my shaves are much better than before, but getting the replacement heads was the major factor.</li>
    <li> The spray pattern is too wide for cleaning small electric razor heads and foils, which results in a lot of wasted overspray.  It should be more narrow. The product itself seems to work well.</li>
    <li> Wish I would&#x27;ve bought this sooner, my blades needed the &amp;#34;reconditioning&amp;#34; earlier. They feel like new again after every coating.</li>
    <li> Good deal.  Prior to finding this deal, I had found the same price for only one can of lubricant.  No problem with delivery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using  this product for over 20 years and it&#x27;s definitely the best. One salesperson at a shaver specialty store told me that some users even spray it directly on their skin. Lately having trouble locating this stuff at a nearby target, walmart, etc. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this stuff and he says that he can tell the difference when he uses this on his blades.</li>
    <li> Product has extended the life of my razor head.</li>
    <li> Been looking for this spray awhile. I think it helps the blades function better. That is the short of this story......</li>
    <li> Yes, it did meet my expectations and I will continue using it. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> keep the razor running smooth</li>
    <li> I finally ran out of my previous shaver lube, needed a new one, and found this. I thought it was probably a bonus that it was sold by the manufacturer of my shaver, Norelco, so I got it. It&#x27;s OK. I just do some brushing off of the whiskers and spray the shaving heads. I think that&#x27;s easier than my old system where I had to wash everything.</li>
    <li> Yes it does, I have been using it for years now....one spray can lasts me for somewhere around a year...a few short sprays on the electric razor head and you have slicker surface which allows for a much better shave....no appreciable residue and pleasant odor.....soon ready for purcahsing a couple more cans.....</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to use this stuff at first because I have very sensitive skin and I didn&#x27;t want it to end up rashing after use.  I gave it a try in hopes of it extending the life of my current razor and razor blades.  It works very well with no irritation at all.  I started using in other devices too.  I use it on a nose/ear hair trimmer and my in shower razor that I use to buzz my head.  Works well on everything I have tried it on and it does a fantastic cleaning job too.</li>
    <li> Buy it !! I use it with all my shavers and it does make a BIG difference. They run better and I think the blades last longer.</li>
    <li> At first I was a doubter, but this product really works. It is a simple and easy to use way to clean my razor. This should increase the life of my blades.</li>
    <li> Works great, smells bood, but I don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s so expensive</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT FUNCTIONS VERY WELL AND AT A REASONABLE COST.  I WOULD DEFINITELY PURCHASE THIS ITEM IN THE FUTURE IF I HAD A NEED.  I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> very fast delivery.  Works well</li>
    <li> Just two short shots on each shaver blade is enough, before and after shaving; the can lasts 3 or 4 months!</li>
    <li> It keeps my Norelco running great. Just be sure to follow the instructions and you will be happy with results.</li>
    <li> Apparently designed for use with the &amp;#34;old-OLD O-L-D norelco rotary razors.  Doesn&#x27;t do a significantly helpful job on the recent models- and is not better than a spray of water - which Phillips suggests.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this for a long time and it was right under my nose. It was as advertised and arrived quickly. Can you ask for more than that?</li>
    <li> Keeps your electric shaver in perfect shaving condition when you spray after cleaning out the cut whiskers after every shave.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t use it any more</li>
    <li> I have used both the Remmington and Norelco Shaver Lubricant and have found that the Norleco product is far superior to Remington&#x27;s.  I have used the Norelco product for years with my 3 Braun Shavers. Even though Braun is self-cleaning and Lubricanting, the Norleco product results in longer time between shaver head replacement, and provides for a less irritating and closer shaving experience. I use this along with Wiliam&#x27;s Lectric shave and I am very satisfied with the results.  I also found that spraying the shaver head with canned air prior to using the lubricant provides additional shaver head longevity and an even more comfortable shave. Finally, the Norelco product has a more pleasant scent. One year ago I replaced my Braun Series 3 shaver with the Series 7.  The Braun Series 7 is a major improvement over the series 3 in terms of the closeness of the Shave and Comfort.  The Norelco product adds to these improvements.</li>
    <li> This product is difficult to find.  Not only did you have it but the price was attractive as well. Thanks</li>
    <li> quick and ez cleaning solution for my electric razor, I recommend it to all Norelco users and its not expensive</li>
    <li> Great cleaner does great job and does not leave any residue.  Make shaving much easier.  Would recommend this product to all others.</li>
    <li> great cleaning product</li>
    <li> there is a considerable difference in shaving following using these cleaners, i clean mine after each use. totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use this religiously but the label shows no lubricant inside. Am I just spraying propellant? Am I addicted or is this spray actually helping?</li>
    <li> Always produces a smooth irritating free shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended this to all who use Norelco Shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this product every other day to get the smooth shave wich includes my hair on the head.</li>
    <li> Used this product for a long time (until Wally World quite handling it)....works as designed....would recommend it to anyone with an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> It makes shaving a lot easier and closer. The price was reasonable and the service was as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ken Kelley</li>
    <li> Good stuff - keeps my Norelco shaver humming smoothly and extends cutting head life. I can tell that I am getting better shaves after using this product regularly.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best lubricant spray that I&#x27;ve ever used.  Will definitely buy it again and will be recommending it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I have been using the little cans of Remington spray cleaner for years. It was high priced and not much in the can. I got two large cans from amazon for less money. It&#x27;s working great:  Larry</li>
    <li> purchased for my husband to use with his expensive razor; he loves it and says it keeps the bladed smooth and working great.</li>
    <li> I have been using this to lube and clean my electric razor for a few years now. The product has worked very well after a good wash with soap and water.  My only comment is that I wish the can held a few more ounces of spray so I didn&#x27;t have to reorder as often.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product on my Norelco for some time now, and Amazon is by far the best way to buy it. Used to drive all over trying to find at drug stores.</li>
    <li> The lubricant helped to restore the original speed of my shaver. I had noticed that the shaver was become less and less efficient in trimming my beard.&lt;br /&gt;It was worthwhile buying it.</li>
    <li> The spray no longer lubricates (according to the label).  Now I will have to buy a lubricant spray (WD-40?) and apply it separately to the shaver heads.</li>
    <li> Great product, great Seller service! A must for any electric shaver.  You get a much closer shave &amp; the shaver blades last twice as long using this product!</li>
    <li> A great deal, fast shipping, does clean my razor, but nothing super fancy.....</li>
    <li> The cleaner works great and also vlubercates the electric razor. And it does not take very much spray to clean the electric razor. And the can lasts for months. So buy two cans, is cheaper than buying one can. Irecommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim in Ohio</li>
    <li> I guess that the old Norelco shaver head cleaning solution spoiled me.  This stuff does almost nothing.  It goes on very cold and freezes the shaver head area onto which it&#x27;s being sprayed.  It evaporates almost instantly.  When it does, it leaves hair and oil residue on the parts that are supposed to be clean.  It doesn&#x27;t improve the shave after cleaning like the old solution used to.  The old stuff was absolutely great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the old Norelco solution isn&#x27;t available any more.  I was expecting comparable results from their replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  I was wrong about the old Norelco cleaning solution not being available any more.  IT IS STILL AVAILABLE!  I bought two new bottles.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, but not worth the cost.</li>
    <li> This stuff is terrific!  I bought new blades at the same time I bought the cleaner.  I tried the cleaner first on the old blades, they shaved like they were  new.  I will not need to use the new blades anytime soon.  I just use it once a week and it likes putting new blades in every week!</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this one a five guys, but I have no idea if it&#x27;s working THAT great. But this stuff is good no doubt. Does seem to help with irritation if applied prior to shaving. It comes out really cold btw so watch your hands. I am struggling to remember to apply it regularly. If I can do that, I&#x27;ll know if it&#x27;s a legitimate 5-star product or not. In essence, my shave felt marginally better after using the spray.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to help me maintain the new Norelco shaver I just bought  this item is very good and makes the shaver that runs smooth run even smoother and leads to very smooth shaving. I love the way it lubricates the shaver. I will recommend this product to all.</li>
    <li> The product keeps my razor head running smoother. I save money. Shaver heads are costly, and I would rather spend money on fun things.</li>
    <li> This Norelco electric shaver cleaner spray arrived at my house very quickly, and was exactly what I wanted.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this vendor.</li>
    <li> A definite product to have to keep your electric shaver well lubricated and performing like new.  Good price/ value and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Thank you for this Norelco cleaner and spray.  I have been looking for this for my Philips shavers and have finally found a place to obtain it.</li>
    <li> Got a new Norelco shaver and wanted to maintain it in tip top shape, so I got some of their cleaner.  Excellent product!  Easy to clean the shaver and it keeps it oiled at same time.  I&#x27;ll be buying more</li>
    <li> Yes it was what we were looking for thank you</li>
    <li> I Bought this product with replacement blades for my husband&#x27;s shaver.  This cleaner / lubricant spray works so well, he has not needed to replace the original blades with the new ones we just bought.  I HIGHLY recommend this product.  I was skeptical about another customer&#x27;s review that it brought back the life of his blades, but it really does work.  This product has restored his original blades!</li>
    <li> Works well.  cleans razor easily, as well as oils the blades for better performance.</li>
    <li> it works well as a cleaning and lubeing product</li>
    <li> Yes! It&#x27;s a superior product!</li>
    <li> Works as it should.  Didn&#x27;t expect anything but the best.</li>
    <li> The philips norelco shaver cleaner and lubricant spray extends the life of the triple head blades.The shave also feels smother. I do Believe you will feel the difference.</li>
    <li> My Norelco shaving head normally gets a little &amp;#34;long in the tooth&amp;#34; each fall prior to replacement.  The Cleaner and lubricant brought the shaving heads back to life, less drag and closer shave.</li>
    <li> Not a good product. Neither cleans nor lubs my Braum.</li>
    <li> This product is only a cleaner, not a lubricant. I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> This lubricant sprays onto my electric shaver as well as my dog clippers. Without it, I&#x27;d be fumbling with trying to drip oil from a bottle.</li>
    <li> Hard to clean, does not give a close shave.  Not happy with it.  My age might have something to do with my problems.  I&#x27;m 83.</li>
    <li> This works all right as a lubricant for my shaver, but I could not stand the perfumed odor -- I had to throw it away.  Those who are not as sensitive to odors as I am will probably do OK with this, but I will have to go with a different brand.</li>
    <li> this was just what i needed worked excellent cleans and got it in super fast delivery veyr happy and overall an excellent product as a great price</li>
    <li> I thought that when I ordered this, that it was to clean the whole shaver and not jut the heads. I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like it. Works well, has a pleasant smell and one can&#x27;s lasted 6 months.</li>
    <li> It works well for its purpose...what more do you need to say about it.  Makes shaving easier if used regularly.</li>
    <li> Works great and has a great price! Keeps the razor clean and lubricated so I get a good shave.</li>
    <li> works real well on my mustache electric shaver, keeps it clean and lubed without gumming up the works.</li>
    <li> not exactly what i thought it would be</li>
    <li> This is the best we have used. Better that the previous Cleaner and Lubricant.</li>
    <li> After fives years with Norelco shaver I bought new shaver and a spray. Shavers got better, but spray is no improvement over water and brush. Just spray doesn&#x27;t clean my shaver I still need a brush. The only thing I suppose it does is lubricates... Doesn&#x27;t smell too pretty either.</li>
    <li> This cleaner and lubricant makes a big positive difference in the quality of the shave with any Norelco shaver.  I have been greatly impressed with this improvement and intend to use this Philips product from now on.</li>
    <li> Very economical way to keep shaver heads clean and lubricated.  I use the spray once a week and notice a big improvement over other lubricants in providing a nice, close shave.  Norelco&#x27;s lubricant does not leave a residue that I&#x27;ve seen with other brands, but instead leaves the shaver heads with a  light (non-viscous) coating that helps the heads glide smoothly across my skin.</li>
    <li> It was delivered quickly.  This product does a fine job in keeping my husband&#x27;s electric shaver cleaned,lubricated and in top working condition.  He is very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff for two years now.  I clean the razor every week and its like new for every use.</li>
    <li> I use this with my Norelco shaver to keep the shaver heads lubed.  I can&#x27;t provide data to back it up (other than looking at how often I am buying replacement heads), but I know that I am changing the heads less often now that I am using this.</li>
    <li> Mmmmmm...slippery shaver.</li>
    <li> yes i use electric shavers forever,,because of sensitive skin, wash it in plane water all the time, but i need to disinfect this before i use it on the face, an lubricate the blades as well, luv the product, does all that i want it to,  used this for 25 yrs plus, hard to find item,  amazon has it&lt;br /&gt;great product under utilized, takes a second to hit the blades with the spray wait a minute, an go at the beard</li>
    <li> Item was not as described. It was so foamy it was not easy to use without a huge mess. Arrived when promised. I would notorder from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Does both functions very well, and seems to last forever too,</li>
    <li> I think it lengthens the life of heads...Quietens the shaver some and definitely a good idea. Word number requirement is bad idea Amazon.</li>
