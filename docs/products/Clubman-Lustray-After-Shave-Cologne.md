### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>excellent price, prodict and service</li>
      <li>The quantity is perfect - one bottle lasts me a year or more shaving 3 times a week.</li>
      <li>This is a good after shave.</li>
      <li>Good scent, good aftershave.</li>
      <li>It is very light and pleasant (and manly).  </li>
      <li>Clubman, for example, still smells nice on my way home from work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used more pricey [[ASIN:979077656X Royal Copenhagen</li>
      <li>I could not ask for a more refreshing after shave lotion.  </li>
      <li>Clubman&#x27;s Virgin Island Bay Rum is much better.</li>
      <li>Pinaud kicks me in the face, and I love that.  </li>
      <li>Lustray is the most refreshing after-shave lotion I have used.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, Clubman products are my favorite</li>
      <li>I reached instead for my free plastic bottle of  Lustray Bay Rum.  </li>
      <li>How many of THOSE are left any more?  </li>
      <li>I decided to try this brand to see if I like it as much as Pinaud Clubman Special Reserve.</li>
      <li>Lustray is every bit as refreshing, but the scent doesn&#x27;t stay with me for more than a few minutes.  </li>
      <li>It is refreshing, not too harsh, and the scent isn&#x27;t strong.  </li>
      <li>There is pretty much no scent/fragrance at all to this aftershave.  </li>
      <li>nice stuff and much less than clubman for $7 its a deal</li>
      <li>The comparatively low alcohol content makes this not as &amp;#34;bracing&amp;#34; as modern aftershaves, nor is it as strongly scented.</li>
      <li>If you like everyone in the room to smell you coming this isn&#x27;t for you--but if you like just a touch, a long lasting touch,  of a very nice and classy fragrance you might really like this stuff.</li>
      <li>You can splash it on and use as much as you want-</li>
      <li>and he said my Royal Copenhagen after shave really bothered him.  </li>
      <li>This is the real deal, but it says &amp;#34;compound&amp;#34; on the bottle instead of &amp;#34;after shave&amp;#34; for a reason.</li>
      <li>the result never overpowers you and doesn&#x27;t seem to linger on any shirt if you spill it or use too much.  </li>
      <li>Spend just a few bucks more and get Ogallala bay rum instead; that&#x27;s REAL bay rum!</li>
      <li>It has a nice smell and does not sting excessively.  </li>
      <li>I used my Royal Copenhagen a few more times before one morning  </li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t long before my single splash of Royal Copenhagen in the morning seemed very strong to me.  </li>
      <li>Lustray Bay Rum has nearly zero scent.</li>
      <li>Brings you back to the wild wild west.</li>
      <li>my entire adult life--and</li>
      <li>It obviously has a pretty high alcohol content, so it will at least heal razor nicks and such.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> excellent price, prodict and service</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with this (alleged)bay rum. It obviously has a pretty high alcohol content, so it will at least heal razor nicks and such.  But that&#x27;s about it.  As for it being bay rum, you can&#x27;t prove it by me... it has absolutely NO scent at all, other than alcohol.  Frankly, I can buy a pint of rubbing alcohol a LOT cheaper than this stuff.  Spend just a few bucks more and get Ogallala bay rum instead; that&#x27;s REAL bay rum!</li>
    <li> Lustray Bay Rum has nearly zero scent. The little scent that it does have is gone before you know it. It probably does cleanse cuts but it&#x27;s not much of a bay rum. Seriously, it&#x27;s like rubbing alcohol and brown dye. Clubman&#x27;s Virgin Island Bay Rum is much better. Why Clubman risks it&#x27;s reputation by putting it&#x27;s name on this, is beyond me. I know it&#x27;s not technically a \\&quot;Clubman Product\\&quot;, but the tag next to it did say \\&quot;Lustray Bay Rum BY CLUBMAN \\&quot;. You know? Anyway, Clubman products are my favorite so I took a chance on it. Lustray Bay Rum is just not good. Period.</li>
    <li> Good scent, good aftershave. I decided to try this brand to see if I like it as much as Pinaud Clubman Special Reserve. Pinaud kicks me in the face, and I love that.  Lustray is every bit as refreshing, but the scent doesn&#x27;t stay with me for more than a few minutes.  Clubman, for example, still smells nice on my way home from work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want the refreshment without the long-lasting manly scent, this one is for you.</li>
    <li> This is a weak aftershave.  It has some alcohol so it will disinfect, but that&#x27;s all it does.  The scent is very weak and all basenote, it smells like cinnamon, clove, and allspice ,but very weakly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used more pricey [[ASIN:979077656X Royal Copenhagen After Shave for Men 8 oz Splash]] my entire adult life--and I&#x27;ve used the same barber/stylist for same number of decades.  A year ago my barber&#x27;s asthma started acting up and he said my Royal Copenhagen after shave really bothered him.  He gave me a bottle of [[ASIN:B001GKH2B8 Lustray Bay Rum]] after shave to use on the days that I had hair appointments.  The Lustray Bay Rum came in a plastic bottle that looked like a Corona Beer Bottle.  I hadn&#x27;t bothered to open it since it was given to me because I figured no matter how bad it smelled I would only have to suffer for an hour or two afterwhich I could wash it off.  It wasn&#x27;t what I expected.  It was very subtle and the fragrance instantly carried me back to barbershops my dad and grandfather brought me to when I was a kid--when and where hair cuts were a couple of bucks instead of $30, before tip, and stylists weren&#x27;t for men.  Cute, not so bad, but not for me.  Or so I thought.  It wasn&#x27;t long before my single splash of Royal Copenhagen in the morning seemed very strong to me.  I reminded myself of those women who smell like they bathed in perfume.  I used my Royal Copenhagen a few more times before one morning  I reached instead for my free plastic bottle of  Lustray Bay Rum.  I have been using it ever since.  The people who say it has no fragrance are wrong.  It is very light and pleasant (and manly).  If you like everyone in the room to smell you coming this isn&#x27;t for you--but if you like just a touch, a long lasting touch,  of a very nice and classy fragrance you might really like this stuff.</li>
    <li> ...to when we were a little boy and our father - or grandfather - would take us to the Barber Shop.  How many of THOSE are left any more?  This is a good after shave.</li>
    <li> Thought I would give this a try despite the bad reviews and since I have other Lustray aftershaves, which I like.  Well, the reviews were correct.  There is pretty much no scent/fragrance at all to this aftershave.  Will never purchase again.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re nostalgic, this is the aftershave lotion for you. Brings you back to the wild wild west.</li>
    <li> I have used Bay Rum for over 5 years.  It is refreshing, not too harsh, and the scent isn&#x27;t strong.  I could not ask for a more refreshing after shave lotion.  You can splash it on and use as much as you want- the result never overpowers you and doesn&#x27;t seem to linger on any shirt if you spill it or use too much.  The quantity is perfect - one bottle lasts me a year or more shaving 3 times a week.</li>
    <li> Lustray is the most refreshing after-shave lotion I have used.  It does not have an overwhelming aroma that some people find annoying and the price is moderate.  i would have no problem recommending it, if asked.</li>
    <li> nice stuff and much less than clubman for $7 its a deal</li>
    <li> did not come up to expectation. very weak aroma.</li>
    <li> This is not Bay Rum. It is a bottle of rubbing alcohol with some chemical added that someone thought smelled faintly like bay rum. A waste of money</li>
    <li> It has a nice smell and does not sting excessively.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal, but it says &amp;#34;compound&amp;#34; on the bottle instead of &amp;#34;after shave&amp;#34; for a reason. The comparatively low alcohol content makes this not as &amp;#34;bracing&amp;#34; as modern aftershaves, nor is it as strongly scented. But if you want to take your SteamPunk cosplay to the level of smelling authentically victorian, this is your stuff.</li>
