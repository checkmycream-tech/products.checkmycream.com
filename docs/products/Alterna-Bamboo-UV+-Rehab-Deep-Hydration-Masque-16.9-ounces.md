<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have very thick unmanageable processed hair. I&#x27;m always looking for something to tame my mane. I started using this 3 months ago. Once a week, or after a day in the pool, I shampoo and sleep with this in. It makes a huge difference, even my hairstylist can tell the difference! My hair looks great after I use it. It feels silky. Has shine. And is much easier to manage. The colors in my hair appears much more brilliant after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - a little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;  -  rehydrates&lt;br /&gt;  - brightens color&lt;br /&gt;  - smooths&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - it is a bit pricey - but worth it&lt;br /&gt;  - more effective if left on longer than recommended</li>
    <li> Love it. It does as advertised.</li>
    <li> I use all of the Alterna Bamboo UV+ products.  The hair masque is great for rehydrating your hair after a day in the sun.</li>
    <li> I use the Bamboo oil &amp; love it so I thought that I&#x27;d try to save some money by switching from the Alterna Caviar Masque to this one.  I used it for about 2 weeks and noticed my hair being substantially drier and frizzier than usual despite not making any other changes to my haircare routine.  It was after I saw my hair stylist of 15 years &amp; she commented on how extremely dry my hair was did it click that I could pinpoint the change to this.  I went back to Caviar a couple of days later &amp; have used it twice since then &amp; have even colored my hair and it&#x27;s still so much softer/more managable than when I was using Bamboo.  Oh well - it was worth a shot - but never again....</li>
    <li> Love this one. I would recommend this to others. Your hair will also love it.</li>
    <li> Nice quality deep conditioner.  I like that it does not contain parabens.  Definitely made my hair more manageable and detangled.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything more for my hair than any of the conditioners (I have many) I use.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I have only used it once so that&#x27;s why I only gave it a 4 star rating.  It&#x27;s nice smooth feeling to your hair though.</li>
    <li> Great hair mask for my dry course frizzy hair. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> After getting highlights, I wanted to buy a conditioning product that would help restore moisture to my dry highlighted hair- this definitely helps a lot!  My hair is very thick/wavy.  After leaving this cream in my hair for a few minutes, it&#x27;s transformed from dry/tangly to very soft and smooth.  I&#x27;ve been using it once a week for the past couple months and have seen great results!</li>
    <li> This is amazing, combined, once a week, with the Abundant Volume Shampoo and Conditioner! I heard about this from my sister-in-law.  Prior to finding Bamboo products, I was considering getting a wig.  Then I cut my hair short.  After two weeks of Bamboo, I&#x27;m looking forward to growing my hair back.  I am a fanatical, organic eater, so my 59 year old thinning hair was very frustrating.  Thank you Bamboo!</li>

    <li> I have been using this product for nine months now.  My hairdresser says \\&quot;keep using it\\&quot;.  She couldn&#x27;t even tell I had been swimming several times a week in a chlorinated pool.</li>
    <li> Using this product instead of conditioner has done wonders for my hair.  I was recently visiting with my son and he used it.  Now I have to send him a jar.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I used this product one time so far and it was okay.</li>
    <li> Bought this to use with the shampoo and conditioner.  It&#x27;s okay as a treatment.  I don&#x27;t find it any better or any worse than other hair treatments I&#x27;ve tried, such as Kiehls.  It definitely does work in terms of not fading the hair color for treated hair.</li>
    <li> Love. Smells great. Leaves my hair soft and not oily.</li>
