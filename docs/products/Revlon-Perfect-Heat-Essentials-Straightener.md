      <li>This one is a top consumer rep*rt one.  </li>

      <li>I got it because my hair got longer and a one inch was more time consuming.</li>
      <li>Save your money for a better product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I was mistaken.</li>
      <li>Notably, there is no grounding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this thing.</li>
      <li>My daughter fell in love with this unit and when my wife dropped it I purchased a replacement here.</li>
      <li>Im in love</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>It comes with so many settings.</li>
      <li>Could not recommend the Solia more &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>I would have given 5 stars because i love this straightener but every once in a while the heat plate snags my hair and pulls it.  </li>
      <li>Bought for my Grand daughter.&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
      <li>I love that it has a auto off and on.</li>
      <li>and i reccomend this to anyone looking for a iron that will not be used every day but more like once a week</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>DEFINITELY WORTH $70 MORE!</li>
      <li>Had to pull out my old straightener I have had for 7 yrs, still works great</li>
      <li>Which is $2 extra but leaves a real nice shine to my hair.</li>
      <li>works good.. heats up fast ..have to becareful not to burn fingers</li>
      <li>I was quite impressed with how straight it did my hair and how quick it got hot.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a person who doesn&#x27;t like to straighten my own hair because I didn&#x27;t think that I would do it right.</li>
      <li>The wider &amp;#34;business&amp;#34; ends keep it from tipping over and bringing the hot plates close to your counter top, and also provide a nice, smooth surface over which to run hair strands.</li>
      <li>So compact and easy to use.</li>
      <li>first checked on-line for reviews, and ended up choosing this because of great ratings and reasonable price.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t the lightest straightener in the world, it&#x27;s sturdy, and I know it&#x27;ll be fine when I stuff it into a bag or backpack for a trip.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The quality of the two heating plates is more than adequate and work fine for my wife&#x27;s medium/ wavy hair.</li>
      <li>It fit in the outlet just fine.</li>
      <li>+great especially if you tend to tilt your head and bend over to one side as you straighten like I do.</li>
      <li>the power light was on.</li>
      <li>Maybe my expectations are too high, but my last Revlon Straightener worked perfectly for over five years.</li>
      <li>That being said, the plates used are awesome and smooth usually.  </li>
      <li>heats up quick and straightens very easily and fast</li>
      <li>However, after about four months, it no longer heated up to full temperature.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gone through several Revlon irons in the last 10 years and this one is the best.</li>
      <li>It is very hot</li>
      <li>This product works good enough, however, after 2 weeks the hot plates started chipping.</li>
      <li>This does the needed job perfectly, I love that it heats up pretty fast and also that it&#x27;s got heat control.</li>
      <li>and it never failed me, until now!</li>
      <li>I was replacing an older Revlon flat iron that was much more effective.  </li>
      <li>Heats up fast, runs super smoothly over my fine hair and keeps it all straight.</li>
      <li>so it is not awkward.</li>
      <li>so i love this but swipe fast because the heat from this thing could probly cook a whole ham in three minutes.</li>
      <li>Because I rarely straightened my hair, I bought this $20 Revlon at a Revlon sale.</li>
      <li>THIS ITEM IS GREAT FOR WOMEN WITH NOT THICK LONG HAIR.</li>
      <li>Super hot.  </li>
      <li>, I just find that I can never get to quite the right heat.</li>
      <li>It just broke down one day, so I was really glad amazon had them in stock for so cheap!</li>
      <li>I have very curly but fine hair and straighten it every day, but I have rarely used a flatiron after my blowdry because I felt it took too much body out of my hair.  </li>
      <li>The quality of the materials used in its construction leaves something to be desired (More specifically; the silver colored grill on both sides of the exterior would have looked better if it had been black to match the rest of the unit).</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is fairly light weight, and is at normal length.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So compact and easy to use. Love it!</li>
    <li> For an inexpensive flat iron it seems high quality.  Because of the large irons it&#x27;s a little awkward in the hand but it does great work so I can live with that.</li>
    <li> Worked well for a month and stopped working. Won&#x27;t buy again :(</li>
    <li> Great product for the money. I couldn&#x27;t find a straightener like this for this price elsewhere so I thought it would be okay but nothing great. I&#x27;m glad I was mistaken. I&#x27;m a person who doesn&#x27;t like to straighten my own hair because I didn&#x27;t think that I would do it right. However, with this straightener it is a lot easier than I expected.</li>
    <li> The ridges on top mean the iron can&#x27;t sit flat, but otherwise it&#x27;s very good.</li>
    <li> I had been searching for a straightener for my fine limp hair for a while now. This does the needed job perfectly, I love that it heats up pretty fast and also that it&#x27;s got heat control.</li>
    <li> This straightener is perfect for all hair types! I have fine, long hair and my sister has thick, long hair and the straightener works perfectly for both of us. I have had it for about a year now and it works just as well as it did when I first got it. It heats up within 5 minutes and you don&#x27;t have to set it to the highest temperature to get the job done. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t have a switch that closes and locks it. Other than that no complaints! Highly recommended</li>
    <li> we were thinking of getting the one inch size, i saw this 2 inch size and thought it would save time( my daughter has thick hair). it work better than expected. time wise and result wise.  great product. if you have thick hair and slightly longer than you shoulder this will be great.  did not use any hair products other than taking regular showers and making sure the hair was dry.</li>
    <li> Because I rarely straightened my hair, I bought this $20 Revlon at a Revlon sale. Boy, was that ever a mistake. This thing broke in no time, and it NEVER straightened my hair!! The cord came out of the straighter, which could cause electric shock! NOT SAFE. It NEVER straightened anyways!!! Legit, I would run it over and over, and wouldn&#x27;t get much of an effect, even at \\&quot;25\\&quot; (highest temp). Never buy a cheap straightener, especially this crappy Revlon, such a waste of money. I received a Pink 1\\&quot; Solia from Folica.com for $91.. DEFINITELY WORTH $70 MORE! Could not recommend the Solia more &#x3D;) Don&#x27;t waste your money, buy a high quality straightener, and look for deals.</li>
    <li> works good.. heats up fast ..have to becareful not to burn fingers</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not working anymore, i need to replace it, This product is very bad. it started well but after some time didnt work. i only used 2 times.</li>
    <li> pathetic..... as soon as I plugged in...there was a smoke all in my room......this is the only product which gave me trouble....</li>
    <li> The ceramic used for the heating clasps is durable. It only takes about a minute or two to heat up completely. Just be aware that this straightener only has a low, medium and high setting. You can&#x27;t adjust it to a particular degree. But, for the price it&#x27;s a nice straightener.</li>
    <li> Makes hair frizzy. Not a good purchase. I bought this as a gift for my mom and she can&#x27;t even use it because it makes her hair look bad.</li>
    <li> Good product love the heat settings works we&#x27;ll on thick hair makes it very silky smooth! Would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter and granddaughter for Christmas.  They straighten their hair all the time and their old one broke</li>
    <li> The plates don&#x27;t connect/close fully when you clamp it down on your hair so I have to hold the ends and consequently burn my finger tips pressing it together. I am genuinely disappointed in this product and shocked that people seem to like it so much. I wish I could return it because it&#x27;s absolutely useless to me. This is without a doubt the worst flat iron I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> I have very curly but fine hair and straighten it every day, but I have rarely used a flatiron after my blowdry because I felt it took too much body out of my hair.  Consequently, I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with flatirons, but I like the extra wide plates, even for the shorter areas of my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to overheat my hair even on the highest setting.  This iron helps a lot with those stubborn curls and with taming flyaways and adding that finished look, without making my babyfine hair too flat. I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong for the price on this.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. Heats up fast, runs super smoothly over my fine hair and keeps it all straight. Great buy at this price, too! ($17.99 when I purchased it.)</li>
    <li> I loved it ,i was hesitant cause my hair is very waivy and thick and it left it smooth ,awsome !!!!</li>
    <li> Died after a couple uses! Waste of money!</li>
    <li> I like this flat iron a lot it is very light weight. I love the adjustable settings they fit me perfectly in my clients. I love that it has a auto off and on.</li>
    <li> NOT REALLY A QUALITY ITEM. MY WIFE AND DAUGHTERS HAVE LONG THICK HAIR, AND THIS ITEM REALLY COULDNT DO THE JOB. I HAD TO PURCHASE ANOTHER HIGHER QUALITY HAIR STRAIGHTNER AFTER 2 MONTHS. THIS ITEM IS GREAT FOR WOMEN WITH NOT THICK LONG HAIR.</li>
    <li> these are great I got my daughter one and myself one bc she had been using mine this past year and it broke!! LOL  they arrived quickly and are a great quality and the price is unbeatable</li>
    <li> This works really well, I just find that I can never get to quite the right heat. However I like it besides that one kink.</li>
    <li> So disappointed it died two weeks ago. Did not even have it a year. Worked great then one day in the middel of straightening light when out and it got cold. And will not work at all...not happy. Had to pull out my old straightener I have had for 7 yrs, still works great don&#x27;t look the best, that is why I purchased a new one.  Going back to the brand that has lasted 7 yrs Remington should have stayed with them.</li>
    <li> Bought this item and its junk it stopped working after the 2nd use. Do not buy this item or you will waste your money on it.. !!!!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is horrible, it truly fall under the \\&quot;what you pay, is what you get\\&quot; saying. I just received it and tried it out and didn&#x27;t like it at all! First of, the heat controller doesn&#x27;t even have an indicator as to what is low, medium or high heat. It doesn&#x27;t even leave a shine to the hair whatsoever. My waist length soft hair looked all frizzy and dried out, even after passing it through small strands of hair. Two passes each and still horrible and no shine! I guess if you are not careful your hair will burn! I should have repurchased the hot tools flat iron instead. Which is $2 extra but leaves a real nice shine to my hair. Only problem with the hot tools is that it breaks easily if it falls. I don&#x27;t return this Revlon flat iron because is too much of a hassle. Save your money for a better product.</li>
    <li> This product did not live up to expectations.  I was replacing an older Revlon flat iron that was much more effective.  This one doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to set.  I find I have to repeat the process several times &amp; still the end result is not great.</li>
    <li> I would have given 5 stars because i love this straightener but every once in a while the heat plate snags my hair and pulls it.  That being said, the plates used are awesome and smooth usually.  It works well on my hair</li>
    <li> Product stopped working after 2 weeks.  Contacted Revlon and they didn&#x27;t offer a replacement for it!  Very unhappy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Very good. Works well.</li>
    <li> Well made, heats up fast and straightens large amounts of hair at a time.</li>
    <li> perfect and a good price! gets very hot and actually keeps my hair straight (i have really thick wavy hair)</li>
    <li> Great product. Gift for daughter, exactly what she wanted, no trip to the store and price was great!!!</li>
    <li> I felt obligated to write a review because it works great for months.&lt;br /&gt;It does its job perfect.&lt;br /&gt;It heats up really quick.&lt;br /&gt;You just need a few mins to do your whole hair.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your time looking around. Just buy it.</li>
    <li> This is the best bet for your money.  Super flat hair.  Super hot.  I use the low/medium setting and it works wonderfully.  Don&#x27;t spend the money on the higher priced irons.  This one is a top consumer rep*rt one.  I&#x27;ve gone through several Revlon irons in the last 10 years and this one is the best.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m happy with this purchase.  i like the bigger size over my old one.  i also like the adjustable heat.  recommended!</li>
    <li> Extremely HOT. and gets hot FAST. Love it. The only downside is no low setting!  The lowest setting on this baby is like a million degrees. But actually because of that it works so well. It is very hot so it takes no time at all. Comparing this to my last one...omg the time it takes now to do my whole head is way under ten minutes and i have shoulder length hair. The last one i bought ( el cheapo at cvs) took forEVER to heat up. so i love this but swipe fast because the heat from this thing could probly cook a whole ham in three minutes. You could burn your hair straight off. Other than that, there is so much less hand strain as you don&#x27;t have to squeeze a great deal like with other straighteners. Also,  the handle doesn&#x27;t get hot around the sides so I&#x27;m not worried about burns like with my last one. Nice long cord so you have freedom of movement- very important! +great especially if you tend to tilt your head and bend over to one side as you straighten like I do. The power button is on the SIDE not inside so it is not awkward. Also the cord rotates at the base of the straightener so no cord twisting/ strain/unnecessary damage there...So..five stars. Great inexpensive buy!</li>
    <li> Im in love lol, I have really bad curly hair. my hair was instantly straight.</li>
    <li> My daughter fell in love with this unit and when my wife dropped it I purchased a replacement here. This price was 30% less than big box local retailers</li>
    <li> I have very long, regular texture , not thick but not fine hair. I bought my first Perfect Heat straightener in 2009 (so 4 years ago). Only recently did the coating on the plates begin to flake off which is why I&#x27;ve bought this one. It&#x27;s a GREAT straightener. I have tried other brands, but none compare to this one. It grips the hair very well, doesn&#x27;t snag and pull hair, and so far has never fried my hair. It heats up very quickly, only takes one pass to straighten and of course, it lasts. If there was a way to replace the coating on the plates I am positive it would last at least another four years :). Definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It straightened my hair to the bone. Would recomend to anyone. It comes with so many settings. It&#x27;s just marvelous.</li>
    <li> I finally started shopping for a new flat iron after I started to feel that my 6-year old Revlon straightener was going to be falling apart soon (only physically though - the plates still worked just as well!).  I have VERY curly, coarse hair and those dinky little 1-inch irons just don&#x27;t do the trick (unless I wanted to spend 3 hours straightening my hair).  My old Revlon was the only flat iron that was strong enough and had plates that actually gripped my hair across the entire plate.  I was terrified of it dying on me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew I wanted a Revlon because their products are obviously built to last.  I tried one model (1.5 inch) and it was good but just didn&#x27;t grip my hair well enough.  Then I FINALLY found this flat iron and I believe it is the updated model of my old trusty straightener.  I LOVE IT!!!  It gets so hot and the floating plates really grip my hair all the way across the plates - making the process go faster!  I can even curl my hair really well with it, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, 5 stars for sure! I have no doubt this straightener will last me just as long as my old one!  No need to spend $100 on a straightener.  This is the best you&#x27;ll find - and you can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
    <li> I got this iron exactly a month ago, today. I was quite impressed with how straight it did my hair and how quick it got hot. I got it because my hair got longer and a one inch was more time consuming. This one saves me alot of time. My biggest problem is, last week, i noticed that the black paint on the plates started peeling off and it would get stuck in my hair. when i would comb my hair out, you would see all the paint stuck in the comb and on my shirt. Also, the areas where the paint came off would prevent the iron from straightening my hair properly. it made it tangle up! Im curious as to whether other customers experienced that issue or not.</li>
    <li> This straightener worked nicely for the first few months. It beautifully straightened my hair, leaving it smooth and without causing any noticeable damage. However, after about four months, it no longer heated up to full temperature. Now, after 10 months, it will not even turn on. Maybe my expectations are too high, but my last Revlon Straightener worked perfectly for over five years.</li>
    <li> Not as great as my Remington, I have extremely thick course hair and it takes me a little longer with this one then mine. However it heats up fast and gets plenty hot for my daughters thick, but fine wavy hair.</li>
    <li> good product for the price and hetas quickly .. i very happy with it</li>
    <li> I use it almost everyday, it&#x27;s very handable, has no weight get your hair straight in just 10 minutes. Perfect!</li>
    <li> 2 1/2 stars    I bought this to replace the same Revlon iron that I&#x27;ve used daily for 2 years.  The only reasons I purchased a new one were because the spring broke and the plates lost their coating. I was pleased that it had lasted so long. BUT when I received the new one, it worked all of 1 week before something began rattling inside and the iron would just stop heating up eventhough the power light was on. I&#x27;m disappointed that the quality of this Revlon product is so variable. Went back to the old broken spring one since it at least heats up!</li>
    <li> One caveat: there is no easy way to hang it up or close it. It functions very well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. It is now August so this thing lasted her 8 months. It did a great job for 8 months I can say. She didn&#x27;t really use it that much, maybe once a week if that often. Just a couple days ago she came to me with a concerned look on her face. Her straightener had &amp;#34;thrown sparks&amp;#34; and well, it doesn&#x27;t work anymore. Things like that just scare me. I will not be buying another one!</li>
    <li> Works well but my hair gets stuck where the plates move.</li>
    <li> Pathetic product .... I have just lost my money</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my wife as a travel hair straightener. It was imperative for me to find a ceramic straightener since my wife will not use any other, due to its effectiveness in straightening as well as minimizing damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Model (RVST2006; 120VAC 60Hz 180W) reaches high heat in less than 30 seconds, give or take (on the medium setting). It has a built-in heat-control dial, allowing you to operate on high temperatures when set to the \\&quot;High\\&quot; setting. The on/off switch is just like any other, and is sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The appliance had a polarized plug (one blade wider than the other), for safety. It fit in the outlet just fine. Notably, there is no grounding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the two heating plates is more than adequate and work fine for my wife&#x27;s medium/ wavy hair. The quality of the materials used in its construction leaves something to be desired (More specifically; the silver colored grill on both sides of the exterior would have looked better if it had been black to match the rest of the unit). The exterior&#x27;s plastic is not high grade, but it didn&#x27;t bother my wife. This is a small point to squabble over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The straightener itself is virtually maintenance free, only requiring to be wiped by a damp cloth when dust or hairspray becomes stuck on the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is fairly light weight, and is at normal length. The handle is thick in comparison to a 1 inch hair straightener (the 170 Watt RV062 model).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if this model will work well for curly hair, I&#x27;d recommend reviewing what other customers have to say in regards to this matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The appliance has a built-in auto shut-off system, which takes effect after an hour of being plugged into the outlet. Resetting it requires you to switch the on/off or unplug and re-plug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does its job and has not burnned out. The price was very reasonable for the 2 inch plates.</li>
    <li> it is so heavy.. Did not like it at all.</li>
    <li> ship very fast,stuff is good!~I like it!~good styff ,I love it ,very nice good !~good good good !~very good !</li>
    <li> I have extremly curly hair that usually takes around 2 hours to straighten completly. This is why i only straighten my hair on special occasions. So i bought this item with the intentions of using once to twice a month but was so surprised by the outcome that my use has doubled. this iron gets hot so fast and i only need 45 or less minutes to complete my whole head. This was a great buy and i reccomend this to anyone looking for a iron that will not be used every day but more like once a week</li>
    <li> Finally broke down and bought a flat iron, after years of worrying that manipulating a hot appliance close to the head would have disastrous consequences! first checked on-line for reviews, and ended up choosing this because of great ratings and reasonable price. The wider &amp;#34;business&amp;#34; ends keep it from tipping over and bringing the hot plates close to your counter top, and also provide a nice, smooth surface over which to run hair strands. wide temperature range allows adjustment for individual hair texture. Working well after two months.</li>
    <li> heats up quick and straightens very easily and fast</li>
    <li> This product works good enough, however, after 2 weeks the hot plates started chipping. Now, if I turn it &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; it remains on. But when I have it &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; it goes off after about 10 or 15 minutes which makes me have to unplug and plug it back in. As far as hot irons go, I have extremely thick hair and this works well. If it wasn&#x27;t for the weird issues listed above, I would give it more stars. Not sure if anyone else had this problem, or it is just my luck! If you don&#x27;t want to spend 100$ on the really expensive ones, this is pretty decent.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron to straighten my daughter&#x27;s hair.  Her hair is slightly wavy and thick.  I set it to medium and plug it in.  It takes about a minute to heat up and then I just slowly run it through about an inch and a half in width of hair.  It works great!</li>
    <li> I have very thick wavy hair and this cuts my straightening time in half. Heats up in about 20/30 seconds and for the price is a great product. Id recommend it again.</li>
    <li> Fake chinese product, advised not to buy.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I had one for 5+ years and it never failed me, until now! It just broke down one day, so I was really glad amazon had them in stock for so cheap! I think I got my last one at Shopko..  This isn&#x27;t the lightest straightener in the world, it&#x27;s sturdy, and I know it&#x27;ll be fine when I stuff it into a bag or backpack for a trip.  I take a shower about every other day, and I can straighten my hair, and know it&#x27;ll be just as nice and straight as it was on the first day (I don&#x27;t have greasy hair).  I have long, thick hair, and keeping it on the high setting all the time works the best for me.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Bought for my Grand daughter.&lt;br /&gt;Was tired of paying full price at super center stores.&lt;br /&gt;Used every day and it works like a charm.</li>
    <li> Does the work! Heats up easily, never had any problem with it.</li>
