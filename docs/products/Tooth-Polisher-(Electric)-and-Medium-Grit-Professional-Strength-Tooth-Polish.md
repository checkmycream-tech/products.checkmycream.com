      <li>Performs beautifully and meets all of my expectations.</li>
      <li>Great product and is as described.</li>
      <li>excellent product I love it really cleans your teeth!!!!!!</li>
      <li>Have been looking for this polisher for month was super happy when I found it.</li>
      <li>This is one of the best tools to use to keep tour teeth looking good even after your regular dental visits</li>
      <li>cup falls off polisher too fast..made very cheap</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>Works great and gently for those in between dentist visits.</li>
      <li>I love it, and I think you will too.</li>
      <li>When using it, hold it as if you&#x27;re holding your pin or pencil, this will allow for better control.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it would work well for the front teeth</li>
      <li>It would be better to just get the polisher compound and use it on a spinning tooth brush.</li>
      <li>I love the way they&#x27;ve created the many colors and flavors of the cups of paste, which does a fantastic job removing any amount of stain from the teeth.</li>
      <li>on/off switch not so easy to use..</li>
      <li>Motor runs fine.</li>
      <li>The polishing cups are cheaply made and would not spin when placed on the polisher.</li>
      <li>The polisher cups that come with it are cheap POS&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>But this product did clean my  tobacco and coffee stains  </li>
      <li>So go ahead, try it, when you see your stain-free new smile, you&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
      <li>Have looked for this product on store shelves for a long time -- glad I found it with Amazon!  </li>
      <li>little set makes a great gift idea and will fit the bill well for that person in your life who&#x27;s such a fanantic about the upkeep of their teeth.  </li>
      <li>A teeth polishing kit that will out last others because it&#x27;s well built, which I was glad to see that the maker had not &amp;#34;skimped&amp;#34; in this area.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure the motor is more weak than a CD player.</li>
      <li>No substitute for regular dental visits but for a quick touch-up works well!</li>
      <li>did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
      <li>Really bulky to use..</li>
      <li>polishing paste works real well with my electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>fast shipping, item was as described.</li>
      <li>This was a great product, I was showing results, a suddenly it stopped working after only a few weeks.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Obviously it cant clean the insides due to the size but it does give you polished teeth for everything that&#x27;s facing the world</li>
      <li>True, doesn&#x27;t have much torque, but spins quickly enough to remove stains caused by black tea or coffee.</li>
      <li>As an ex-dental assistant, this is not the first time I&#x27;ve purchased this kit, I did so some years back when they were sold in your local drug stores.</li>
      <li>first of all if you have stains other than your very front teeth, you can not get to any of the side teeth because of the big contraption that you can not get in your mouth....</li>
      <li>I too purchased this teeth polisher as a means of in-between dental cleaning maintenance, and I have to say it really does live up to how it&#x27;s expected to perform and always have.</li>
      <li>cup is a little too soft and motor should handle a little more pressure.</li>
      <li>Hard to get back of teeth clean.</li>

<li> Hard to reach back of mouth..</li>
<li> It&#x27;s impossible to reach the back of your teeth since the motor is directly behind the polishing cup, which is the primary reason I bought it.</li>

<li> It says it removes stains, that&#x27;s false.</li>
<li> This is very poorly designed.</li>
<li> this is the worst product I ever bought.  </li>

    <li> Hard to get back of teeth clean. Open wide!  Works we&#x27;ll otherwise. I would recommend this polisher.</li>
    <li> excellent product I love it really cleans your teeth!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is very poorly designed. It&#x27;s impossible to reach the back of your teeth since the motor is directly behind the polishing cup, which is the primary reason I bought it.</li>
    <li> Really bulky to use.. Colored sticks left stains on my counter. Hard to reach back of mouth..on/off switch not so easy to use..</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get to the back inside molars it&#x27;s too big, so it&#x27;s now in my junk drawer. I&#x27;m sure it would work well for the front teeth but that&#x27;s not how I was going to use it.</li>
    <li> As an ex-dental assistant, this is not the first time I&#x27;ve purchased this kit, I did so some years back when they were sold in your local drug stores. I too purchased this teeth polisher as a means of in-between dental cleaning maintenance, and I have to say it really does live up to how it&#x27;s expected to perform and always have. When using it, hold it as if you&#x27;re holding your pin or pencil, this will allow for better control. Do not press too firmly against your teeth, and try to avoid the gum tissue, if not, there&#x27;s an uncomfortable burning sinsation that occurs. Slightly but steadily press the &amp;#34;start button&amp;#34; and remove those stains. I love the way they&#x27;ve created the many colors and flavors of the cups of paste, which does a fantastic job removing any amount of stain from the teeth. A teeth polishing kit that will out last others because it&#x27;s well built, which I was glad to see that the maker had not &amp;#34;skimped&amp;#34; in this area. You may not ever have need to reorder for the white polishing cups because you can get such very long use out of just one.&lt;br /&gt;This little set makes a great gift idea and will fit the bill well for that person in your life who&#x27;s such a fanantic about the upkeep of their teeth.

    <li> Great product and is as described.</li>
    <li> This was a great product, I was showing results, a suddenly it stopped working after only a few weeks.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as expected.  It revolves and then it stops.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm.  I love this.</li>
    <li> AAA+++ just as ordered!</li>
    <li> the motor that powers this thing has no power behind it. I&#x27;m pretty sure the motor is more weak than a CD player. It says it removes stains, that&#x27;s false. The polisher cups that come with it are cheap POS&#x27;s. It would be better to just get the polisher compound and use it on a spinning tooth brush. Save your money.</li>
    <li> Have been looking for this polisher for month was super happy when I found it. This is one of the best tools to use to keep tour teeth looking good even after your regular dental visits</li>
    <li> The polishing cups are not webbed. Therefore, they splatter the polishing paste and do not keep it in the cup or on the tooth- retired dentist</li>
    <li> The polishing cups are cheaply made and would not spin when placed on the polisher. This is a piece of junk.</li>
    <li> fast shipping, item was as described. cup is a little too soft and motor should handle a little more pressure.</li>
    <li> True, doesn&#x27;t have much torque, but spins quickly enough to remove stains caused by black tea or coffee. No substitute for regular dental visits but for a quick touch-up works well! Wouldn&#x27;t attempt to polish ALL teeth as it is rather bulky--just for the smilers in front--comfortably! Can overheat teeth if left too long in one area so use caution when using! Paste is a &#x27;medium&#x27; grit and should be used sparingly as enamel doesn&#x27;t grow back once removed! For the person who has everything already except THIS!  👊</li>
    <li> Awesome value as it cleans tobacco and coffee stains from my teeth with ease&lt;br /&gt;Obviously it cant clean the insides due to the size but it does give you polished teeth for everything that&#x27;s facing the world</li>
    <li> This product did not work.  The head kept falling off and as soon as I pressed the device to my tooth it would stop working due to lack of power. I would not purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> Works great and gently for those in between dentist visits.</li>
    <li> Have looked for this product on store shelves for a long time -- glad I found it with Amazon!  Performs beautifully and meets all of my expectations.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first ! But this product did clean my  tobacco and coffee stains  Off the front of my teeth !</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work.  Head stopped turning and fell off just as the cup touched a tooth.  Motor runs fine.Tried to get it to work, gave up.&lt;br /&gt;The polishing paste works real well with my electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I had a similar product years ago.  Used until it finally wore out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might try gluing this thing.....</li>
