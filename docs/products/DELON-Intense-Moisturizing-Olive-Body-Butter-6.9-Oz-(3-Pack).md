      <li>My friend bought me some in a package for my birthday five years ago and it has since been my top choice for lotion.  </li>
      <li>Then I found it on line - always at a better price than Body Shop&#x27;s brand.  </li>
      <li>I have got so many compliments after use, stating i have the softest skin ever</li>
      <li>Hope to get more.</li>
      <li>and I was able to find the product on the internet.  </li>
      <li>Warm, earthy, light.</li>
      <li>I fell in love with Delon Body Butter when it was given to me as a gift two years ago.  </li>
      <li>LOVE it.</li>
      <li>Love love love this body butter.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>Thank you again Delon for creating such an amazing product that makes us woman feel truly beautiful.....</li>
      <li>Every one was great as far as moisturizing goes, but the olive scent is the one I love the most.</li>
      <li>It absorbs easily into my skin, leaving it so smooth, even the rougher and more challenging areas.</li>
      <li>The cream I originally tried and fell in love with.</li>
      <li>It is a great daily moisturizer for the skin, just out of the shower with no overpowering scent.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately the jar was intact</li>
      <li>It was smooth,</li>
      <li>and I had to buy a variety pack with all these sweet fruity fragrances that were too strong for me</li>
      <li>I originally got some of this body butter in a gift bag probably 5 years ago and have been ordering it myself every since...  </li>
      <li>If it had not been part  of the original package, I would probably not have tried it.</li>
      <li>I loved the smell but suspected my skin would not be able to tolerate anything other than baby oil.  </li>
      <li>Good Products I will buy again in the future.</li>
      <li>It is light, not greasy, is absorbed quickly and leaves skin hydrated and sweet smelling.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what  they mix in it to make it smell so good, but it smell better then just plain olives.&lt;br</li>
      <li>which normal lotion won&#x27;t do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Skin is soft and not dry and also smells great.</li>
      <li>The Olive Body Butter is by far my favorite.  </li>
      <li>Wish it came in a vat - I would jump right in.</li>
      <li>As a professional in health care recently experienced,  I personally and liberally applied this product to a chronic old shoulder injury.  </li>
      <li>I have used it for several years and still love it.</li>
      <li>these are bigger than the ones that I have purchased in the store for alot more money.</li>
      <li>thanks very much.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>the phrase &amp;#34;body butter&amp;#34; makes me think of a product that is much thicker and richer than this stuff.</li>
      <li>I like it so much.</li>
      <li>Leaves skin soft and smells incredibly fresh.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended this product!</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very fresh and has a unique scent that is difficult to describe, but it&#x27;s the reason I always buy more.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many other name-brands [bath n body, etc]</li>
      <li>Coming from someone who worked for nearly two years at Bath and Body Works, I have sampled hundreds of different fragrances and this is, by far, my absolute favorite.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got extremely dry skin and use lots of lotion, so this product makes sense, since its fairly cheap.</li>
      <li>I have had trouble with psoriasis for many years.  </li>
      <li>Makes skin very soft.  </li>
      <li>basically it was a skin cream that didn&#x27;t absorb very well and left my skin feeling sticky.</li>
      <li>After reading other reviews, I expected to receive a very rich moisturizer.</li>
      <li>When I use this every night on them, they become soft and smooth - no more cracking.</li>
      <li>I would say it is a sweet, earthy fragrance and not too heavy or overpowering.</li>
      <li>Really does away with dry scaling skin - if you remember to use it, that is.</li>
      <li>This body butter isn&#x27;t greasy and sinks right in to relieve my dry itchies.  </li>
      <li>I bought three containers last summer and just ran out, so they last roughly a year, depending on how often you use them and how much you use each time.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Someone put a jar of the mango scented, and I just had to buy some. I don&#x27;t like heavily scented products though, so bought the Olive scent based on the reviews. I absolutely love it. It&#x27;s so creamy, soft and perfectly scented. It soaks in quickly, and my skin feel marvelous. The scent lasts and lasts. I sit at my desk at work and keep smelling my hands! Its so relaxing. I am allergic to many products, breaking out in rashes, getting headaches or sneezing fits. Not so with this stuff.  Its wonderful!</li>
    <li> Great stuff - bought it before.  Fast shipping. No Problemo!&lt;br /&gt;Buzzz</li>
    <li> Best body butter I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> The DELON OLIVE BODY BUTTER is absolutely the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  It is light, not greasy, is absorbed quickly and leaves skin hydrated and sweet smelling. I prefer the Olive, as the other scents are too overpowering. I have used it for several years and still love it.</li>
    <li> I first discovered body butter at Body Shop but found this Delon identical product at Cosco&#x27;s one holiday season and was very impressed with the quality and price.  Then I found it on line - always at a better price than Body Shop&#x27;s brand.  It is a great daily moisturizer for the skin, just out of the shower with no overpowering scent.  All of the ingredients speak to &amp;#34;moisture&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;natural.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have used Delon body butter for years now!! It is the only brand that i will purchase. I have tried many other name-brands [bath n body, etc] My fiends have boughten me other brands as well for different occations and i end up throwing them out. Delon truly does moisturize down deep. I have got so many compliments after use, stating i have the softest skin ever and they mean it! I am a camp councelor every summer and I get my cabin girls each one. The wonderful thing about Delon is they have different scents to choose from. However, the Olive-Non-scented one works amazing for the winter-time when you do not want to smell like the beach, etc and just want your skin to be moisturized and wear your favorite perfumes!! Thank you again Delon for creating such an amazing product that makes us woman feel truly beautiful.....</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!  Best body butter not oily at all, my skins absorbs it really well and the smell is perfect!</li>
    <li> The best  sold anywhere</li>
    <li> This olive butter is delicious. It has a great fragrance and is very moisturizing. I am giving it as a gift since I purchased a 3pack.</li>
    <li> Coming from someone who worked for nearly two years at Bath and Body Works, I have sampled hundreds of different fragrances and this is, by far, my absolute favorite.  My friend bought me some in a package for my birthday five years ago and it has since been my top choice for lotion.  The consistency is not too thick, but thick enough that it doesn&#x27;t just absorb into your skin right away.    The fragrance itself is not too heavy, which I really like.  It&#x27;s very fresh and has a unique scent that is difficult to describe, but it&#x27;s the reason I always buy more.  I bought three containers last summer and just ran out, so they last roughly a year, depending on how often you use them and how much you use each time.  I would definitely give it a try, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> nice lite scent.  use it everyday</li>
    <li> So rich and pleasant smelling. Love it! Wish it came in a vat - I would jump right in. Hope to get more.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Very moisturizing and I love the smell!</li>
    <li> Best body butter ever made. I used to buy it at Costco,but they have not sold product in a while and I had to buy a variety pack with all these sweet fruity fragrances that were too strong for me</li>
    <li> This is my favorite bath butter. It&#x27;s so creamy without being hard to rub on. It lasts a long time and when the plastic container is empty, I can reuse it for storing things. I don&#x27;t know what  they mix in it to make it smell so good, but it smell better then just plain olives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially like to use it on the bottoms of my feet which get really dry and cracked. When I use this every night on them, they become soft and smooth - no more cracking. I also have a patch of weird dry skin on one of my elbows that itches, and I put this on several times a day and it keeps it from itching, drying and flaking (which normal lotion won&#x27;t do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s creamy and silky without leaving an oily residue.</li>
    <li> I originally got some of this body butter in a gift bag probably 5 years ago and have been ordering it myself every since...  it has a nice mellow smell and works great and very smooth on the body.  I now give it for gifts myself I like it so much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got extremely dry skin and use lots of lotion, so this product makes sense, since its fairly cheap. It works well and the olive variety smells great, but why is the can sold half-empty ?</li>
    <li> I distributed the variety body butters for my destination wedding back in 2008. It was a hit. Leaves skin soft and smells incredibly fresh.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with Delon Body Butter when it was given to me as a gift two years ago.  Since then, I&#x27;ve tried almost all the different flavors.  The Olive Body Butter is by far my favorite.  Warm, earthy, light. If it had not been part  of the original package, I would probably not have tried it.</li>
    <li> Good Products I will buy again in the future. thanks very much.</li>
    <li> I have been using this body butter for years. I have never found anything that works so well.  Really does away with dry scaling skin - if you remember to use it, that is.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful! Skin is soft and not dry and also smells great.</li>
    <li> LOVE it. Very smooth and creamy texture without feeling oily. Use it for my eczema.</li>
    <li> great buy. these are bigger than the ones that I have purchased in the store for alot more money.</li>
    <li> Great for the complexion. Makes a nice gift.</li>
    <li> I bought the variety set in Costco about a year ago. Every one was great as far as moisturizing goes, but the olive scent is the one I love the most. Now I just order the set of three. I keep it by my bed and never go to sleep without it. I swear that I am addicted to it and my hands and legs feel great. I hope they never stop making the olive scent. I share it with my daughter and she also loves it.</li>
    <li> The cream I originally tried and fell in love with. It cleared up that dry ugly skin within just a few days!</li>
    <li> Love love love this body butter.  This butter is soooo creamy.  I had a jar given to me at Christmas time and I had to order more!  Highly recommended this product!</li>
    <li> I have had trouble with psoriasis for many years.  I came upon a jar of Delon in some effects left me by my sister six years ago.  I loved the smell but suspected my skin would not be able to tolerate anything other than baby oil.  When I came across it again, I decided to try it for several days at least.  To my surprise Delon did everything I have been hoping for.  It was smooth, the scent delightful to me (and I hope to others), and I had no negative reaction from my psoriasis.  I have had this jar of Delon for about six years.  Needless to say, after my &amp;#34;trial&amp;#34; I wanted more.  Fortunately the jar was intact and I was able to find the product on the internet.  I have ordered a good supply and hope Delon is still around when I have used that up.</li>
    <li> This is a very smooth moisturizer .  I always use it on my legs after a shower.  Makes skin very soft.  When I start to run out I begin searching to purchase more.  It also makes a very nice gift which is how I began using it.</li>
    <li> This product is pain relieving for shoulder tendonitis.  As a professional in health care recently experienced,  I personally and liberally applied this product to a chronic old shoulder injury.  It took away the painful symptoms in 24-48 hours.  I consulted two co workers and they both claimed to know of its healing ability.  I researched the web for healing power of olive oil on google and its reported confirmation of healing effect for several conditions beyond just the skin.  Best of healing to those of you who try it.</li>
    <li> the phrase &amp;#34;body butter&amp;#34; makes me think of a product that is much thicker and richer than this stuff. basically it was a skin cream that didn&#x27;t absorb very well and left my skin feeling sticky. i will probably get rid of the other two jars.</li>
    <li> Winter is tough on my skin.  I get unbearably itchy.  Regular lotions and creams were just messy and didn&#x27;t last long.  This body butter isn&#x27;t greasy and sinks right in to relieve my dry itchies.  Super wonderful stuff!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t penetrate into the skin so good but I like the texture and smell</li>
    <li> This body butter is wonderful. It&#x27;s thick and creamy, but not greasy. My skin (and I) love it! It absorbs easily into my skin, leaving it so smooth, even the rougher and more challenging areas. Plus, it smells aaamazing. The scent&lt;br /&gt;is hard to describe...I would say it is a sweet, earthy fragrance and not too heavy or overpowering. Great price for a 3-pack. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> After reading other reviews, I expected to receive a very rich moisturizer. Instead, it was just an ordinary cream. It did leave a nice sheen on the body, and has a light fragrance. Not much of a moisturizer. I don&#x27;t think I would reorder.</li>
