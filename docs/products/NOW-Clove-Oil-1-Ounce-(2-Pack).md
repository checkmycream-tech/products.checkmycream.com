<li> I would recommend this to anyone who has chronic tooth pain due to sinus issues.</li>
<li> I did let the seller know, shipped it back at their cost, and received another bottle a day after shipping the broken one.</li>
<li> I mix a few drops in my hand with a few drops of water and DMSO.</li>
<li> Also, if you don&#x27;t have dental insurance and are poor, it will kill the exposed nerve of a broken tooth over a few weeks with daily application.</li>
<li> So I did some research and learned that Clove Oil will numb the nerve/tooth.</li>
<li> and I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.  </li>
<li> Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I tried this on a friend of mine who had a tooth ache. She found instant relief from the pain she was having. I only wish I had known about using clove oil like this sooner.</li>
    <li> After trying other brands, this one is w/o a doubt superior.  This has a much fresher scent than what I&#x27;d tried earlier and I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.  Scent is very strong and long lasting.</li>
    <li> arrived timely and intact</li>
    <li> I had a filling fall out of my tooth and my Dentist appointment was far off. So I did some research and learned that Clove Oil will numb the nerve/tooth. So I purchased it and it did just that. It also makes your breath smell fresh. Once I made it to the doctors appointment that Dentist told me that clove Oil was a great choice and he couldnt of prescribed it any better. This NATURAL product will STAY in my medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> The quality of this clove oil is exceptional, and I&#x27;ve used the oil in several of my \\&quot;recipes\\&quot; for personal products.  Shipping time and bubble-wrapped packaging ensured a safe delivery that arrived a day early.  That always makes me smile.</li>
    <li> Great quality, fast shipping. NOW is my favorite brand of EO&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> This was exactly as described - pure clove oil.  Works great on your teeth and gums to stimulate them.  Also, if you don&#x27;t have dental insurance and are poor, it will kill the exposed nerve of a broken tooth over a few weeks with daily application.</li>
    <li> I had read that clove oil inhibits mold so I&#x27;ve begun using it in a walk-in shower to address the mold on caulking. It does seem to be working and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Great for diluting and using on my teething baby - has been a real life saver!!</li>
    <li> I use this to make my own Thieves blend by adding cinnamon bark, lemon, eucalyptus, and rosemary. It&#x27;s rather potent for cleaning, and seems to keep the ants away. I also dilute the blend with argan oil to rub on my baby&#x27;s feet to help him fight off cold/flu germs. There are lots of Thieves recipes online, so I won&#x27;t bother adding mine here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle label includes a recipe for a Blues Relief Blend: 2 drops clove, 2 drops lemon, 3 drops orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extraction method is &amp;#34;steamed distiller from clove buds, leaves and stems.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started getting into essential oils. This oil is strongly scented. When it arrived, one bottle cap was not sealed and had leaked, so needless to say, the odor of cloves was quite strong. I did let the seller know, shipped it back at their cost, and received another bottle a day after shipping the broken one. Quite pleased with the service! Clove oil&#x27;s great for toothache, plus smells great in a diffuser. Also mixes well with other essential oils to create your own aroma. Very pleased and would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Strong stuff ...got a couple of bad tefus cant afford dentist , trying healing the American Indian way :) so far so good</li>
    <li> This product is great for minor tooth aches.  Takes the pain away almost immediately.  I would recommend this to anyone who has chronic tooth pain due to sinus issues.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping. Item as described.</li>
    <li> NOW products are always as advertised. The potency is great. One drop does wonders. Received product well packaged and as advertised.</li>
    <li> Great scent! Not medicine smelling at all. After you&#x27;ve had it opened it few times the scent does get less intense. I&#x27;d rather it stayed the same, but I still like the product enough to purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Crimson and Clover, over and over!</li>
    <li> I buy essential oils to work on my SPA ... I met this brand when I was in New York City and loved it, everyone who bought me very pleased ... My customers love .. is what differentiates the packaging, mostly came very well packed .. Only once had a problem, and one of them came pouring perfumed the whole box, but nothing else, not stop buying ...</li>
    <li> This is a high quality oil and very useful with many benefits.  I love to add with salt in warm water for a sore throat gargle.</li>
    <li> Definitely worked for my skin problem. The smell is quite intoxicating but I got used to it. highly recommended for scabies issues</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve torn rotator cuff muscles on both of my shoulders - two times. Each time they took years to heal as I did not want to have surgery. I never stopped working either. I used a very hot lotion for years to help with the pain. One day I thought about the numbing power of clove oil and ordered some of the Now Oil. The results of using this on muscles is beyond fabulous. I mix a few drops in my hand with a few drops of water and DMSO. Applying it to the skin is easy and it is absorbed very quickly and the DMSO carries the other two products deep within the muscles. There is an initial quick warming to the skin then gently the skin takes on a mild warming sensation that lasts for a few hours - thus relieving aching muscles. Also the aroma is quite pleasing too. Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not experienced with oils but as far as I can tell it&#x27;s a very good product..smeeeeeeeeeeeeels great and works for what I got it for.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with how quickly they sent my order. I got it much sooner than expected, and it is a great product.</li>
    <li> Use it as a mouthwash in combo with coconut oil and water. Heals and numbs mouth ulcers very quickly. High quality Oil.</li>
    <li> My wife has had a problem with \\&quot;burning mouth syndrome\\&quot; for quite some time.  It&#x27;s gotten to the point that frequent use of lidocaine gel inside her mouth has become necessary.  But that requires spitting it out, which is not very convenient out in public.  She carries this clove oil with her wherever she goes, and is able to use it fairly easily, with little to no attention being paid by others.  And it works - not quite as well as the topical anesthetic, but quite acceptably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works as a breath freshener, by the way - excellent!</li>
