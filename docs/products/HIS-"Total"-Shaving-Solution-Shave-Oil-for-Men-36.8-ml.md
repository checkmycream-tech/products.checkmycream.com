    <li> About ten years ago, I started looking at information on shaving.  I was ready to try shaving with a safety razor for a while instead of with my dying electric razor.  Thanks to the magic of Google, I found Total Shaving Solution.  I was intrigued and eventually ordered a bottle.  I haven&#x27;t even thought about shaving any other way sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total Shaving Solution is a shaving oil.  I had never heard of anything like that before.  According to their website, you can use it before you shave with a traditional razor of an electric razor.  I&#x27;ve never tried it with an electric, but I do like how my face feels when I am done.  They have separate varieties for men and women.  Quite obviously, I have never used the women&#x27;s, so I will only be speaking about the men&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The general idea is to use it the same way you would shaving cream, as a lubricant to help you shave.  I had tried using shaving cream, but I found it left my skin dry and irritable.  That&#x27;s not the case here.  While I still can irritate my skin, I find it much easier most of the time to avoid that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it is an oil, it works best when wet.  In fact, the official instructions tell you to wet your face, put some on, and then wet it again before you start shaving.  If your skin does begin to dry out, rewet it and you are good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have discovered I like shaving in the shower.  And I tend to like hot showers.  The combination of the two is perfect to use this.  The steam helps my skin soften and this oil stays slick, doing the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I truly get very little irritation.  I can shave with this stuff six days a week with little to no problem.  With my electric, every other day irritated my skin.  The oil acts as an after shave as well.  In fact, they recommend spreading a couple drops on your face afterward if it gets irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an oil, it doesn&#x27;t foam, so you don&#x27;t have that to guide you as you run the blade over your face.  I had done a little shaving with shaving cream, and I liked having a visual guide to where I had and hadn&#x27;t shaved.  But I have found that if you actually focus on what you are doing as you shave, you get everything.  And this has an added bonus.  I can shave around my goatee and sideburns without shaving too much or not enough thanks to shaving cream hiding the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what you get, this stuff is pricey.  A 1.25 oz bottle costs $15.00 (plus 4.33 shipping since this is only available over the web).  Yeah, that&#x27;s what I said at first, too.  But the site does offer free samples, so I tried one of those.  The sample tubes (which they continue to send you whenever you order) are only good for about two shaves.  But that was enough to convince me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when you start using it, you&#x27;ll see that the price isn&#x27;t as bad as it appears at first.  They recommend you use two to three drops per shave.  I use three.  Plus, the once or twice a year when I get the urge to shave my head, I&#x27;ll use three for my head as well.  That&#x27;s truly all I need.  So I get just about the year they promise out of one bottle.  Now when you figure what you would spend on traditional shaving cream during that year, this really is very economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside, at least for me, is the times I can&#x27;t shave in the shower or surrounded by steam.  This stuff really works best with lots of moisture.  When I don&#x27;t have it, I don&#x27;t get the lubrication I need.  So if you can&#x27;t or don&#x27;t like to shave in the shower, this won&#x27;t help you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I know it does something.  I tried out of curiosity to see what shaving in the shower without this stuff would feel like.  It wasn&#x27;t a pretty picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve found a shaving routine that works well for you, great.  Stick with it.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years, and I&#x27;d never switch to anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great with a blade, or with an electric.  It gives the most pain-free shave I&#x27;ve ever had, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I have rosacea, and almost everything irritates my skin, but not TSS.  Actually, it was the wife of a friend with rosacea who recommended it, because her husband uses it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re super-sensitive to shaving like I am, and/or if you have rosacea, I recommend this 100%.</li>
    <li> This little bottle of oil really works as well as they claim. I apply it in the shower after washing my face with warm water. I apply four drops to my fingertips and rub them in well. (My face is large). I get a very smooth shave, and my skin is soothed afterward, pulled together by the menthol. For some reason, my razor blades even last longer. It&#x27;s really good!</li>
    <li> By far the best shave of any product I have ever used!  I have tried every natural shave cream on the market over many years (I had a beard for 15 years because I hated to shave). This is the only product that use now, and the shaves are smooth, non-irritating, and quite easy.  The additional benefit is that my skin is also in far better shape than with any other cream or shave oil that I ever used.  Also, while it may seem a bit expensive at first, since I use 6 - 7 drops at a time, it lasts for a few months, making it very reasonably priced, especially for the exceptional quality.  It is rare to find such an outstanding product, and I am thoroughly delighted with it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a long time fan of HIS shaving oil. I think it&#x27;s the best and use it everyday. Bottle lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t need a big can of cream, gives a smooth shave.  Been using this stuff for years and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The seller was good to deal with.  The product arrived quickly and when I returned the item, my money was refunded promptly.  However,I was astonished at the burning sensation when I used the product.  I use a gentle Nivea gel currently, and I was looking for something that I could use on airline trips.  This might be OK for someone who enjoys mentholated products, but it was not for me.</li>
    <li> I have used Shaving Solution for years. My beard is thick and I have to really work at shaving. This solution keeps the pain away.</li>
    <li> I got this for a long trip to Japan: I also bought a tiny electric shaver.  The shaver was terrible, the screen got dented and then it was semi-dangerous.  I switched to blades and noted that this stuff was supposed to be good for either.  With blades it was *fantastic*.  That was 8 years ago--I&#x27;ll never use another shaving &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; product again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and use it every day. I does the job of making my face smooth and I get a very good shave. I use a wet\dry razor and shave in the shower. Works great.</li>
    <li> I found this on a whim out in San Diego at a pharmacy. I tried it and WOW...this stuff is great. Just 3 drops is that&#x27;s needed and my face is soft. I didn&#x27;t believe it&#x27;d work, but in fact it does. HIS has more menthol to HERS so you can switch off, depending on your flavor of the day. I got both. Made by a family owned company in IL...USA baby!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Total solution for shaving for at least 20 years.  I find it to the best, I do not get razor burn and no nicks.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product exclusively since getting a sample in early 2000. I wouldn&#x27;t even think of ever using shaving foam again.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me due to constant irritation after shaving.  Using the same razor, following the directions, this left me with much less discomfort.  I will continue to use over shaving gel.  Make sure to follow directions, it really does work.</li>
    <li> I will address some of the complaints I have read in other reviews to start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My order arrived within two days.&lt;br /&gt;I use a multi-blade shaver which does clog. Gently tap the handle on the edge of the sink; problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;3-4 drops is plenty, which really surprised me.&lt;br /&gt;I never would have believed it would be this effective, but I get a closer shave as I have had with any other cream or foam.&lt;br /&gt;I have not burned or cut myself yet, a fairly common occurrence before.&lt;br /&gt;You may have an oily feeling after the shave. A quick wipe with the washcloth takes care of that.  Leaves you face refreshed rather than dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lot&#x27;s of other good tips and practices in some of the other reviews.  Try them.  This stuff is really good.  As to my face, I have a pretty heavy beard.  I can&#x27;t skip a day without looking scruffy at best.  I also spent 30 years in the Marines and wish I had this stuff in the field.  I know what a dry shave is and this stuff would have helped immensely.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for more than 20 years and only for brief periods, when I was unable to purchase it, didn&#x27;t shave with it. In the beginning, I used it with an electric shaver but lately I&#x27;ve been shaving with Gillette&#x27;s Mach 3 or Fusion blades. In both ways, it worked perfectly for me.</li>
    <li> I agree completely with previous reviewers: with a bit of warm water and 3-4 drops of this stuff, you will have an impressively close and painless shave. If you feel any razor-tug, just a bit more water and off you go again.  It has a great scent, avoiding some of the chemical odors of the popular gels and foams.  My only quibble is that you do have to be more careful when cleaning your razor--it tends to clog some of the newer multi-blade systems out there.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving solution I&#x27;ve ever used! I have been using it for over 10 years! I recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> i liked the product however, it&#x27;s entirely too expense for the bottle to be as small as it&#x27;s.  The least that could be donw is that the bottle be upgraded to a larger size.</li>
    <li> I have used  His \\&quot;Total Shaveing Solution\\&quot; for over 15 years. It gives the smoothest shave I have ever had. I will not use any other product.&lt;br /&gt;There are other products on the market that I have tried but none work as well as HIS \\&quot;Total\\&quot; Shaving Solution Shave Oil for Men.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Total Shaving Solution for several years now, and will never go back to traditional gels and creams. This oil offers excellent protection. It&#x27;s important to note that is for wet shaving only. Works perfect for people who shave in the shower. If not in the shower use warm to hot water to moisten your skin. Water, couple drops of oil, then water again &#x3D; Happy Shaving!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and years. it is a wonderful product for me. I have tried others and they just don&#x27;t seem to stack up to total solutions.</li>
    <li> The website I used to buy it from went belly up, so I am glad I found it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always shaved in the shower since I was a teenager, and this stuff has really cut down on the nicks and scratches of face shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making this available Amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using TSS for at least 10 years and far prefer it to creams. The little bottle is more convenient too. And last longer than you&#x27;d think.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since I was handed a sample by a man at the Natural Products trade show about 18 years ago (I think he was the inventor)... the stuff is awesome if you follow a couple of easy steps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, your face should be damp, and fresh from the shower works best. Wet your hands and squeeze 3 drops into your palm. Rub your hands together and then rub your hands all over your face. Wait 30 seconds or so and you will feel the tingle of the menthol. Shave as normal but your razor should be wet too. With this you can shave in any direction you want - with the grain, against the grain and never ever will you get razor burn. Now on the slim chance you do, it&#x27;s because you weren&#x27;t as thorough as needed with the application of the product with your hands. If you do get a hot spot, take one drop of the product on your fingertip and apply to the affected area. The irritation will disappear very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will never get a closer shave - yes even closer than a barber shop shave.</li>
    <li> I was pretty skeptical when I read the display at the local health food store. I tried the sample and it work, but not quite enough to convince me. Found a second sample a year later and tried it again. I had cut myself several times lately because of the dry air. Wow. I forgot how well the first one worked. I use it under shaving cream and no nicks. I just bought two bottles, one for travel one for home.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for many years. Fast delivery too.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S GREAT,SMOOTHS SKIN,JUST 3 DROPS,NOR RAZOR BURN,GO FOR IT</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use any foam or shaving soap or anything else.  Just this, my Merkur safety razor, and very hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tips: It&#x27;s important to use this AFTER a hot soapy shower.  You want your face moist.  Don&#x27;t let the humidity out of the bathroom too soon. The bottle says 3 drops, I find 5 drops to work better.  After the oil is on, make sure you splash water on top of the oil. Finally keep your razor clean and wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never have any burn or nicks or cuts except when I ignore my own advice above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great stuff.</li>
    <li> If you do not mind waiting more than a week for an item as small as this then maybe you want to purchase from these people. I would rather pay a little more and have it here faster. It is a week now and still no shaving oil.</li>
    <li> I discovered \\&quot;Total\\&quot; shaving solution several years ago, I believe from a mention in Esquire magazine. It is simply fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave in the shower, and usually 4-5 drops in wet hands on a wet face will do the job. EVERY shave comes out close, smooth, and irritation-free -- which I could never say during all those years of gels and foams. The small package is also perfect for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the price is extremely reasonable, as a single bottle will last weeks. I generally buy 3-4 bottles at a time, and will never purchase anything else for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if they can just become Amazon Prime eligible....!</li>
    <li> This smells great, make shaving very easy, even with a dull razor. It&#x27;s better than any cream I have used.</li>
