      <li>This case is not a disappointment.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to find a case that would hold 40 bottles since most hold only 30.  </li>

    <li> Item is as described and holds bottles securely.  It is a great way to organize those little bottles!</li>
    <li> Started falling apart after a few uses</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these cases for my oils and both when unzipped and opened the velvet covering ripped at the back seam. So now will be using black duct tape too fix them. Also had to squeeze the zipper parts down or the little tab you pull comes off. Other than that, I am satisfied with my cases.</li>
    <li> I love it!!!!!! It only takes 15ml sized bottles..</li>
    <li> Essential Oils Carrying Case Holds 40, 15ml Bottles - Beautiful Custom Hard Shell Exterior with High Density Foam Interior - Perfect for Young Living and Doterra.&lt;br /&gt;The faux leather outside of the case is modeled throughout.the outside has a shiny surface.  High density, dual layered EVA foam on the inside which protects your bottles. I tried several size&lt;br /&gt;bottles and the ideal size bottles were the 15 mil bottles.&lt;br /&gt;The Case opens full 90 degrees for easy access to your oils. The case is light and easy to carry. Handle is study. The case was packed well well and arrived quickly. I am very happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I Recieved this product for free or a reduced price for my honest unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Came on time, holds a lot of oils..but..the binding isn&#x27;t holding up.  The glue is coming away and I am not sure how long it will last.</li>
    <li> I love this essential oil case. I am a massage therapist--running between my office and clients homes. I love having this essential oil case to take with me. My oils are well protected and secure in this case. They fit snug inside the inner foam casing and are protected by the hard outer case. I also love that it will hold all varieties of essential oil bottles. This case keeps my oils protected and looks great too. I get compliments everywhere I go!</li>
    <li> I have been wanting something to hold my oils in besides a cardboard box. This is an awesome holder for my oils. It has a very nice faux leather outside of the case which is modeled  throughout. It has a zipper around the top portion of the case and a sturdy carrying handle which will easily withstand the weight of your oils inside the case. Once open it has a velvety texture on the inside of the case top. The bottom has a spongy insert that has holes cut into it for your oil bottles. This insert is removable easily. You could use this for your makeup if you wanted to take out the insert. This is the perfect solution for carrying/storing all those oil bottles. The only thing I need now is the labels for the top of the bottle so that I can tell which oils I have without removing them from the case to look at them.&lt;br /&gt; The ideal size bottles were the 15 mil bottles. I tried ones  from both Do Terra and YL, and they  fit in this nicely. The 5 ml bottles I have were loose in these slots and when I turned it upside down, they did come out and roll around. ( I don&#x27;t have many 5 ml though so this isn&#x27;t a problem.. I also don&#x27;t plan on up ending my oils much)My barefoot 15 ml bottles fit perfectly also.&lt;br /&gt; This case also fit the taller Kid safe rollers from Plant Therapy that I have. I liked that the case was tall enough to accommodate those rollers. They didn&#x27;t fall out when I turned it upside down. Probably because they are taller, but they are also a bit loose.&lt;br /&gt;My barefoot 15 ml bottles fit perfectly also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I received the case in a timely manner, however I unzipped the case and the zipper clasp broke off .  So there are two zippers on it no big deal I will use the other one.  I opened the lid and the back of the lid at the seam ripped all the way across.  It seems that the lid was not made to be opened all the way.  It looks a lot better in the picture than is.  I would not recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> Fits all my EOs snug. Even my rollerballs stayed put when I flipped upside-down.</li>
    <li> Love the box, however the material on the lid tore loose when I opened it at the seam where lid and box are fastened together. Everything else is great very sturdy when oils are put in.  It would be nice if it had a secure place for the 5ml bottles. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Came broken at the lid sent back for refund.</li>
    <li> I was excited to find a case that would hold 40 bottles since most hold only 30.  But, as soon as I unzipped it, it tore where the lid was connected to the bottom.  I was going to order another one hoping it was just a defective case, but the price had increased $5.00.  Needless to say, I am not happy and will have to settle for a smaller case.</li>
    <li> While I was very excited to find a case large enough to hold so many oils I was disappointed to discover upon opening it for the first time that the crease fabric ripped. First time! I could not reach the seller to discuss this dilemma or request a new one.</li>
    <li> Its a nice box and I added a small lock to it to keep my grandchildren from being abke to open it, however, the Now brand oils are too big for the slots and the smaller bottles auracacia can turn over if box is not kept upright</li>
    <li> Have the 20 bottle case and it is very nice, but full.  Needed more room.  This case is not a disappointment.  Great looking and holds all my oils.  I am thrilled.</li>
    <li> This Essential Oils Carrying Case is just what I have been wanting. I am fairly new to Essential Oils and as I build up my supply, I was in need of somewhere to store them. So I was happy to have the chance to receive this case at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. This storage case is beautiful, it has a shiny crocodile look on the outside and a nice soft velour feel inside. The inside has a double layered foam insert with holes in it to hold the oil bottles and it holds 40  5ml - 15ml bottles. The case zippers shut and has a nice strong handle on top to carry it around. It is very well made with a hard shell exterior and double zipper pulls. I really do love the Essential Oils Carrying Case by BA Designs and I recommend it to every one that uses Essential Oils.</li>
    <li> I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This Essential Oils Carrying Case is just what I have been looking for. I didn&#x27;t have anything to put my essential oils in. This was the perfect solution for carrying and storing all my bottles of oils. The case is very sturdy, shiny, and close tightly. The inside has a double layered foam insert with holes in it to hold the oil bottles so that the bottles don&#x27;t spill or break. It has a handle on top of the case so you can carry it around with you. The outside of the case is a faux leather which you can easily wipe clean</li>
    <li> It is just perfect for holding all my oils.  It was even nicer than I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> I have an addiction to essential oils and well let&#x27;s face it you can end up with a ton if you are not careful because it&#x27;s easy to get them but keeping them well that is another story what are you going to do with them?  Well you can buy this and put them in it.. It is so nice that you can keep it out and let people see it not hide it.. You have to be careful people will end up trying to &amp;#34;borrow&amp;#34; it.. It is a very nice case and hold lots of my collection.. they are snug and secure in the case and you are sure that they are protected..&lt;br /&gt;I was very lucky to have received this in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  I love it and am very happy to provide my opinion after getting it and testing it out.</li>
    <li> This case has a very cheap inside cover that covers the inside top and extends to the hinged opening. The fabric or whatever it&#x27;s made of ripped the very first time I opened the top. Very unhappy with this purchase. Not worth the price at all.</li>
    <li> Hinge ripped apart second time I opened it. Works ok, bit poor quality.</li>
    <li> my oil bottles would fit but the hinge seam arrived ripped/damaged.  I did not have confidence that it would hold up.  I would not buy again, quality not worth the price at $35.  I returned it.</li>
