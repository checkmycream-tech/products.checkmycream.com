<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Product is great, cuts even and trims great. My wife, as nervous as she was, even did a great job using them.</li>
    <li> I just brought the Wahl 79900N yesterday and boy do I love it!! I cut my son&#x27;s hair using the 1/18 clip(or whatever it&#x27;s called) and it gave him a nice even cut. I hated taking him to the barber shop and waiting 2 hour to get a haircut, what a pain. Now I can always keep him fresh to death and not waste 2 hours of my life in a loud barbershop.  My only drawback is the trimmer that pops up, it doesn&#x27;t give a good clean shape up. I will just buy a T-Line separately. But overall I am very happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Wahl beard trimmer to cut my hair until recently.  The Clip-N-Trim was so easy that I could do 95% of the work myself (in only around 5 minutes, needing help just lining up the neck.  Great product, easy to use, good purchase.</li>
    <li> I cut my husbands, sons and grandsons hair, I have had a Wahl for many years and it finally went to hair heaven. I purchased another brand and quickly took it back, it wouldn&#x27;t even trim there necks.  I went to Amazon and pulled up Wahl and ordered one.  I am very satified and it cuts wonderfully.</li>
    <li> This Wahl hair trimmer works exactly as it should. It is quiet and powerful and a great value. I recommend it. With the popularity of the Buzz cut around our house, this is a great money saver.</li>
    <li> I am now barber but this thing works and comes loaded and in a very cheesy case.&lt;br /&gt;it is kinda noisy but no more than any I&#x27;ve seen cut my thick hair easily and with no jams.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the guides are accurate though my 2 seems awfully long.</li>
    <li> I only need a few things in a hair cutting kit and the Wahl 799900B does them all incredibly well, plus some:    1. Size 1, 2 and 3 combs made of flexible, durable plastic that fit the machine securely. 5 stars.  2. Fast cutting speed. My Conair Champion makes me do many passes over the same area to cut the hair to the level I want. The Wahl cuts more hair per pass so I finish the job much faster. 5 BIG stars.  3. A machine I can hold and maneuver comfortably that is not too noisy. The Wahl, like the Conair, is not quiet. But I don&#x27;t find either too noisy either. 5 stars.  4. Combs and scissors that work well. The combs are flexible and shaped just right. The scissors are sharp. I have to mention this because I can&#x27;t say the same for my Conair kit&#x27;s scissors. 5 stars.    The extras:  1. Detailing attachment. It has a unique flip out attachment that can be used to trim the hairline and give that perfect, finished look. I especially like this feature because it extends from the machine and makes it easier to reach difficult areas like behind my head when I&#x27;m cutting my own hair.  2. Hair cutting video. Doesn&#x27;t come with the kit but the Wahl website describes how to use the machine to do various cuts.  3. Barber cape.  4. Small, compact kit.    The only thing I would like better would be a bigger brush. The supplied brush is small - only as wide as my pinky finger - and takes more time to clean the machine. The Conair came with a much bigger brush - almost as wide as my hand - so I use that one to clean my Wahl. This is however not enough for me to deduct a star.</li>
    <li> I prefer my hair cut short. Do I have to pay to someone for just using their clipper 15$, if I can purchase my own for 30$ and use it for at least a year? The answer is \\&quot;NO, I don&#x27;t have\\&quot;. I tried the clipper, and it did it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> The clippers cut very smooth. The size is a little different than I am used too but that is to be expected with a different brand of clippers. I usually use a 2 guard for my hair but the 2 is a little long, so I will be using the 1 next time. The clippers were very noisy (almost too nosiy) but the noise was coming from the detail trimmer that is attached to the clippers. It was vibrating very bad. Just popped it off and the noise was gone. If I want to use the detail trimmer I just have to pop it back on. No problem. Great clippers for the money.</li>
    <li> The item was shipped and delivered quickly to me.  This is first trimmer I ever bought. So I tried to use it for hair cut the night I received it. There are many choices for cutting the hair through different combinations of haircut kit. It works smoothly. I think I can keep my hair in good style with this kit.  It is also pleasing to have a 5-year limited warranty.</li>
    <li> I have owned a number of inexpensive clippers and this one is by far the best.  I have only had the unit for a month and have only used it once, but you can tell that it is made from much sturdier material than most clippers.  I have no data on longevity, but so far so good.    One note, The guides on this model do not match the length on the guides of my old clippers.  This isn&#x27;t a bad thing, just something you should realize before the first haircut.  It was no problem for me because I like a close haircut.</li>
    <li> I just got mine in the mail today and the product must have been updated because the accessories I recieved are not what is displayed on the website. Amazon you need to update. I did not recieve a neck brush and only one comb. To top it all off the plastic part of the detail trimmer is cracked. I have not used it yet but hopefully it will work.</li>
    <li> This is the very first trimmer I ever used.  I was tired of waiting in line and paying what I can do at home in 15 minutes.  The trimmer is fairly easy to use and requires minimal maintenance.  (I just brushed the hair off after each use.)  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It would deserve a full 5-star if the latch of flip-over fine trimmer didn&#x27;t break the first time I used it.  The fine trimmer still works with my thumb pressing to hold it in place.  Since then, I have given and received haircuts 20+ times using it (that&#x27;s what starving graduate students do other than subsisting on Ramen noodles.)  When I save enough money, I think I will simply get a beard trimmer to do the fine touches.  After all, one can&#x27;t expect a $20 tool to do everything.</li>
    <li> GREAT TRIMMER! HAS SAVED ME ALOT OF MONEY ON HAIRCUTS, THE LINE UP PART ISNT TOO EFFECTIVE FOR HAIRLINE USE, ITS GREAT ON THE BEARD AND MUSTACHE TO A DEGREE. JUST NEED TO KEEP GOING OVER THOSE AREAS A FEW TIMES. SO I ADVISE YOU GET A LINEUP EVERY 2 WEEKS TO KEEP YOUR HAIR LOOKING SHARP! A MUST BUY!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair with the same Conair clippers for the past 7 years and they still work.  I only got the Wahls because I saw they had a 1.25\\&quot; and 1.5.\\&quot;  So far, they&#x27;ve been working great.  I still use my conair&#x27;s to fade my sides because the Wahl combs are a little sharp, but other than that my hair never looked better.</li>
    <li> I purchased this clipper kit to replace an old one that I have and I must say that this Wahl is absolutely great!  It cuts through hair like butter.  It does a great even job at cutting the hair.  It takes me much less time to do my hair than with my old clipper. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I did my son&#x27;s hair as well and it did a wonderful job.  I didn&#x27;t realize how bad the previous clipper was until using this new Wahl on his hair.  It did a great job. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have many shorter hair attachments compared to the others, but the one that is short enough works fine.  It doesn&#x27;t make a loud noise, but rather a humming sound...like a hair clipper. LOL.  My point is that you won&#x27;t damage your eardrums cutting the sides. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to any do-it-yourselfer for hair.</li>
    <li> Works well.  I&#x27;m cutting my husband&#x27;s hair with it.  The instructions help on where to begin cutting and move around the head.  Lots of different attachments for as long or short as you want the hair.</li>
    <li> Wow!  You just don&#x27;t realize how bad those old clippers were until you ditch them  for these beauties!  I loved the ease of instructions and use!   There are so many options with these attachments so both my 16 year old and my 52 year old are willing to go out in public.  I have to admit that the lower price made me wonder about quality, but they more than proved their worth!</li>
    <li> This clipper works great.  It has lots of guard sizes, more than most kits.  They clip on the clipper easily.  Has a long cord, clean-up brush, every thing you need to give a hair cut.  I am pleased with this clipper and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is a really good buy for the price.  Makes a good gift.</li>
    <li> We purchased this kit because my sons wanted to get simple buzz cuts and we didn&#x27;t want to spend the money or time at the salon to get this done.  It is easy to use and works beautifully.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to get a close cropped cut.  Paid for itself in two uses.  I would purchase this kit again.</li>
    <li> buzz buzz cut cut oh what a haircut i got.  my whole neighborhood now borrows this.  so i would say it works.</li>
    <li> this works great and I don&#x27;t even know how to cut hair I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Another fast delivery of a great product at a great price from Amazon!  Ordered this because a lesser brand of clipper I was using gave up the ghost after just 2 haircuts. Old clipper used to get too hot to handle half way through a clipping. This Wahl goes the whole distance without even getting warm. Instructions, attachments and clipper are of professional quality and just feels good while using. Followed Wahl&#x27;s instruction book and performed my own haircut in record time with absolutely no mis-steps or accidents. There is a guide attachment for every need and when properly selected, you can&#x27;t seem to make a mistake. The very first haircut appeared to be a professional job (my wife&#x27;s comment). Cost-wise, this clipper will pay for itself with just 2 haircuts. How can you beat that?</li>
    <li> Item was shipped on time. Great price. Everything came as mentioned and is a great product. Fiance loves it!!!</li>
    <li> At about half the cost of taking my three boys to the barber, I figured this little toy would pay for itself even if I used it once and hated it.  I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised.  The trimmers have a solid feel to them.  After several haircuts, they&#x27;ve long ago paid for themselves.  And the kit has all the attachments I need for my toddler&#x27;s cute little kid style and my teen&#x27;s much shorter buzz.  My barber made the mistake of telling me right out which attachment he used for my teen, and I think that&#x27;s the last time we saw him.  I&#x27;d feel bad, if I weren&#x27;t saving about five hundred dollars a year!!     The case and some of the accessories are a little on the cheap side, but the clippers are solid and well made.  The clippers and case fight snugly, but there is enough room to cram in a small mirror and a fistfull of lollypops.  Essential barbering tools, no doubt!</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with this product. The price is reasonable in relation to the type of material (plastic). Temperature can increase with use. I think it is perfect for use at home.    [[ASIN:B00008BNZ4 Wahl 79900B Clip-N-Trim 23-Piece Complete Haircut Kit]]</li>
    <li> Nothing to complain about. I wanted a high powered trimmer for cheap and that&#x27;s what I got.  It is quite noisy and the attached \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; is worthless, but the clips are a good range of sizes (even the lowest setting isn&#x27;t quite low enough, but it&#x27;s fine) the cord is long enough and it does its job.  It does get hot too but that is expected.  Overall this product did nothing to WOW me, but it does exactly what it is supposed to do, nothing more nothing less..</li>
    <li> How do you make a quality hair cutter for $25 ? Answer: YOU DON\\&quot;T  They are trying to compete with the Chinese made Conair kit but that kit also is junk, I tried two different Conair&#x27;s and this Wahl none of them can cut hair and my hair is quite thin. Pay more it is cheaper in the long run.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews and seeing the star ratings, I&#x27;d thought this would be the best hair clipper. However, I was instead very displeased with the product. First of all, the hair clipper is really bulky and heavy. Product dimensions are listed at 4 pounds. Secondly, I had a problem with the attachments. They did not fit sturdy on the clipper and made a rattling noise when it was turned on. Lastly, the whole thing is just way too noisy. I felt like I was about go deaf when cutting near my ear. Despite the many positive reviews, I would really try to avoid this product.    I also looked into other hair clippers and bought the Wahl 9655 Rechargeable Clipper. The power is ridiculously weak and stops when the hair gets too thick.    I am done with Wahl products. They&#x27;re are honestly all very poorly made. Better luck with everyone else&#x27;s experience.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my husband&#x27;s hair for 18 years, with a Wahl. I purchased a new one, 23-Piece, almost a year ago, and while it does cut hair pretty well and all the accessories are there and nicely marked, due to the noise I am giving up on it. It never was very quiet, but now some attachments cause it to make such a loud noise that it&#x27;s unbearable. Yes we have tweaked with the screw on the side but to no use.</li>
    <li> Hi All,    Dont buy this item,as this is made of poor quality Plastic.  Its hair trimmer broke after the 2nd use.</li>
    <li> When I opened the package this hair cutter came in, the box was ripped, the trimmer was lying loose with the cord undone and had fingerprints on it, the packages with the accessories were opened and a few of the parts were also lying loose in the box! I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s right to \\&quot;recyle\\&quot; a used personal care product such as this. Be careful if you order this item.</li>
    <li> This hair clipper is perfect if you want to do your own quick and easy trimming at home.  It&#x27;s perfect for my short haircut. I use the #2 on the sides and a #3 on top.  It&#x27;s easy to get around the ears and is so much easier to use than the smaller rechargeable battery hand held one I had before.  The one draw back is that the &#x27;detail&#x27; trimmer which flips out from the top of the trimmer and locks over the head doesn&#x27;t let you trim close to the skin around the ears like I expected.  However, that&#x27;s the only limitation I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
    <li> This Wahl&#x27;s hair clipper is the best hair clipper I have ever purchased. It cuts very well and is easy to maintain and operate. It seems very sturdy. I am glad to buy and use something that is Made in the USA. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> So happy I bought this set. For the $ I can&#x27;t imagine getting a high quality shaver set. The detail trimmer is so nice! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a shaver to specifically shave a bald headed person and this type is doing the job greatly. He also uses it to shave his beard....</li>
    <li> IT was my 1st time cutting my husband hair with this product. I thought I couldnt do it. He asked me to try the 1/4\\&quot; 1st. It was so easy to use. He then wanted his hair to be shorter, so I used the 1/8\\&quot;. I didnt hurt his skin or anything at all. I am so confident on myself now. I buy an extra one for my mom to cut my papa&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty decent trimmer set for how relatively cheap it is. You could spend $100 and get a better one but it&#x27;s not worth it in my eyes. So far I&#x27;ve owned this product for about 6 months and its never presented me with any problems. The detail trimmer is a bit loose and makes an obnoxious noise if you don&#x27;t keep a little pressure on it, but that wouldn&#x27;t be a deal breaker in my opinion. I&#x27;ve saved so much money it&#x27;s ridiculous. At this point if you&#x27;re in the market for a trimmer I&#x27;d say this one should be up for consideration because it&#x27;s cheap and does the job well w/o pulling any of the hairs out of your head. Quit making the hair stylists richer and just order one, you will be so happy you did.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit because I was tired of making appointments.  Waiting.  Getting poor haircuts.    If you use the attachments and a little patience you or your wife/friend can do a decent job.  I goes from just about bald to 1\\&quot;.  It has tapered guides for around the ears and scissors for details.  I would not recommend this for people with long hair.  My hair is pretty short (not buzz cut) and it does a good job with the 1\\&quot; guide.  The vacuum feature is a good idea.  It doesn&#x27;t pull the hair up or anything crazy like that.  It just catches the hair after it&#x27;s cut.  It doesn&#x27;t get it all but 95% isn&#x27;t bad.  Easier clean up.    It&#x27;s already paid for itself and then some.  Still doing a good job after a year.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I wanted to try cutting my own hair, the way I saw it what was the worst thing that could happen right? These clippers are easy to use and the 23 piece kit is a great compliment to them. The guards are great, you do not have to worry about them slipping off or anything like that. The guards also come in an assortment of lengths  hair lengths like .5 inches or 1 inch). My only gripe with this kit is there are no detailed instructions on how to use the guards. Some of the guards are for your ear and to taper your hair, but there are no instructions on you how to use them. To be more specific I was not sure how to hold the clippers when using the ear guard. All of the other guards are pretty straight forward though. I had no problem with these clippers aside from the first time I used them I held the clipper the wrong way and gave myself a slight bald spot, but this could have been avoided with common sense.  Final Verdict: These clippers where a great purchase. They were literally the cost of a haircut (20 dollars) at the time I bought them, so I cant complain.  Pros  *Price  *Great Clippers  *Lots of Guards  Cons  * Lack on instructions  WARNING  * The guards do not work if you hold the clippers upside down. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> In these difficult times it was hard to justify $40 for a haircut when when it can be done at home. The instructions, settings and equipment made it so my wife (who&#x27;s never cut hair before) did a fantastic job of cutting my hair that I get compliments on.    And with Amazon prime, this and all my other purchases arrive in just 2 days with free shipping. How can you beat that?</li>
    <li> This trimmer/clipper works very well for the price.  Quality built except the trimmer attachment which does feel a bit flimsy.  The trimmer worked fine for me but I could see where other issues could arise for other people or long term use.  The trimmer didn&#x27;t seem any louder to me unlike stated in other reviews.  Comes with a good amount of guides for longer cuts to shorter cuts.      Certainly worth the price and will pay for itself in no time.</li>
    <li> My husband had a set similar to this, same brand...just an older model. I got him this set for Christmas this year and he absolutely loves it. He is in the military, and with needing a haircut weekly this set is perfect for an easy do-it-yourself cut!</li>
    <li> I have cut my husbands hair for 3 years now. I have always used Wahl products and never have encountered a problem until I bought this item. The trimmer does not align correctly to the main blade and therefore does not make the proper horizontal movement to actually cut the hair. I ended up returning it. The only good thing I can say was that amazon did a great job with delivery time and accepting return/crediting my account. Over all I recommend Amazon; I do not recommend this product. I would purchase a Wahl product that has the smaller trimmer separately (not interconnected with the main trimmer. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This product is a good one for home users only. good points about it, you can trim your beard, cut your hair in various sizes and shapes, the blades of the Wahl are great. Negative points: It is a bit heavy and noisy. But in general, the product is satisfactory and gives good haircuts.</li>
    <li> I was looking for DO IT YOURSELF hair clipper that is easy to use with TOP QUALITY. THIS WAS IT~!!! NO DOUBT about it. I have used it over 2 years now, saving lots of money on professional hair cut. Everything I needed was right there in the kit. I use this clipper to death, and still going STRONG~!! Gives me Accurate cut every time. BEST THING I have ever done for my personal care~~!!!</li>
    <li> Lots of choices for hair length.  Just doesn&#x27;t produce a very close cut on neckline.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;m glad I purchased it. It paid for itself immediately. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> Pretty decent trimmer, easy to use and it pack a punch; but the most amazing quality is how quite it is! And at a very good price, with a very solid construction. Could not ask for a better hair trimmer.</li>
    <li> The trimmer arrived today.  We tried it out by having the wife cut my hair.  it trimmed it up nice and short.  The finishing trimmer appears pretty delicate, but I think if handled carefully it will provide a relatively long life.  Lots of cutter guides to use, theres even one for trimming eyebrows.  Or should I say \\&quot;eyebrow\\&quot;, because if you need to trim it, you probably only have one covering both eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not to thrilled with the carry case.  Mine arrived cracked.  it appears to be pretty cheap plastic and there are no separators inside the case so everything will slide around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because of the case.  It does appear to be a pretty good trimmer for a very inexpensive price.  I guess if I wanted extreme heavy duty and a great case I could have spent 5 times more money.  But I don&#x27;t need to this time.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my brother in law and my husband.  Both seem to love it!  The only downside is now my husband expects me to cut his hair!  It has every attachment he could possibly need including an ear trimmer, eyebrow trimmer  and cape.  He had a Wahl before which lasted over 10 years and this is its replacement.  Great for the price...just a bit more than one haircut at a barber. It also comes with directions on how to cut hair so maybe I won&#x27;t have to shave him bald!</li>
    <li> I had a Wahl trimmer for 20 years and it finally gave out so i gave this one a try.Well it works great, my old one was a little better but for this price i can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> good product.easy to read directions. for the family on a budget easy way to keep costs of haircuts down. easy to use. trims well</li>
    <li> I bought these clippers after spending over 80 dollars (again) for a horrid haircut.  My hair is ultra thin, fine, and prone to breakage no matter what high end products I Use.  Six months ago, I decided to go super short.  Problem?  Finding stylists who know what they are doing.  I tried a barbershop once, but ended up looking like I was AWOL from boot camp.    These clippers were easy to use and gave great results.  I have never shaved my own hair before, but the instructions were clear and it was a fun experience in a strange sort of way.  One problem was that the instructions describing the clippers were incorrect (color coded instead of all black), but the guard combs were clearly marked so I couldn&#x27;t screw up.    Being a novice, I was nervous about trying this, and my hair ended up shorter than I intended.  If your hair is thin, use a longer length comb.  Otherwise, very easy to do and no bald spots from the salon!  Well worth the low price and has already paid for itself.</li>
    <li> Like I said...the best clipper for the money. Hands down. I clip my entire body and this does the trick. My old clippers would pinch my skin at times...not with these. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> Hair clipper gave me a clean cut. Real sharp but safe to use. With so many sizes to choose from, this is excellent for different hair styles. Downside to this is it heats up after using it to cut the hair of two people...too warm to touch that I had to let it cool before using it again. Otherwise an prized purchase for the sale price.</li>
    <li> I have learned now (after my third clipper of this type) that you truly \\&quot;get what you pay for\\&quot;. Not a bad product; does the job but it is NOISY !! You need to be diligent about lining up those adjustment blades with stationary ones- but all in all, good product for the little money you&#x27;ll spend.</li>
    <li> The thought of cutting my hair is beyond consideration but two little Yorkies just love this set.  The main reason is that is is quiet and effective.  Those, to me, are the operative words:  quiet and effective.  When you turn the clipper on it makes a humming noise instead of a loud \\&quot;I&#x27;m going to get you\\&quot; sound.  Then when you start cutting small animal hair you actually cut it without pulling or leaving gapping holes in their fur.  Maintenance is easy and with all the tools you could almost go into business but I&#x27;ll pass on that.  Additionally, you have the Wahl brand and that makes a positive difference.</li>
    <li> I recently received this product.  It apprears to be a good deal.  It is heavier than other clippers.  I turned it on and it virbrated a lot.</li>
    <li> I bought this from EVERYTHINGHOME.COM  The kit arrived in a Pansonic shipping carton which originally contained parts from an importer-exporter--without a Packing Slip, Invoice, or Return Form!  Things did not look good.  The Wahl clipper inside was missing cutter teeth and the blade was out of sync.  I was instructed to return it to it a different company: OCI, with the \\&quot;O\\&quot; standing for Overseas (Everythinghome.com considers orders from OCI to be \\&quot;direct from the manufacturer\\&quot; shipments.  Yeah, right.  I was really worried now.  EverythingHome charged a 15% \\&quot;restocking\\&quot; fee on return of a defective unit--and didn&#x27;t refund return shipping charges!  I was so furious I ended up buying it from Wahl direct.  (Actually, I should have bought it from Amazon.com., where I get most of my stuff, and get a lower price to boot.)  Who knows where Everythinghome gets their stuff.  As for the Wahl clipper set itself, it is great in every respect!  It&#x27;s a complete kit and I love it.  Replaces another Wahl clipper I had used for 13 years (during which time I saved over $2,000 cutting my own hair.)  Don&#x27;t hesitate one second in getting this performer. My advice:  get it from Amazon.com., and stay away from Everythinghome.com.</li>
    <li> No more paying the korean lady $15 just to have my head shaved. I hate you great clips lady: for telling me its not any cheaper to have a machine only cut and for throwing in the scissors and acting like you&#x27;re actually doing something just to make it seem like it took longer than 2 minutes after shaving with the lowest clip.</li>
    <li> The construction on this clipper is great. From the moment you pick it up you can feel the heavy duty construction. Definately worth more than the ~$30 I paid for it. Cuts great and didn&#x27;t overheat or clogg. I would definately recommend and buy this again.</li>
    <li> I bought this machine and found it to be rather useful. Firstly I must commend AMAZON for delvering it before its scheduled time. The first day I got it I used it and I just wait for the opportunity to use it again and again. I have invited all I know to forsake their barbers and come by me. I would encourage people to buy this machine and as we are aware of the global economic situation, it would be wise to cut back on our spending and this definitely would help. A machine of this kind is low maintenance and highly economical in both the long and short run.</li>
    <li> This is a good trimmer for someone who is deaf becuase this thing is so fricken loud is louder then a bomb i dont understand how people can put this next the there ears and cut your own hair its impossible, dont buy this look at the price and the amount of returns it has be smart think, i made big mistake buying it, didnt even have a chance to use it coz it was so loud.</li>
    <li> Purchesed this product after reading many reviews. We were looking to save some money on haircuts for the hubby &amp; figured for the price why not give this clipper a try. I basically just started out using the longer comb guides until the length of hair cut looked the way we wanted (you can always take more hair off, but you can&#x27;t put it back on if you cut too much off). If you follow the instructions it&#x27;s not that difficult. I would guess over time I will get even better &amp; faster. I may even feel brave enough to experiment on different styles. I wouldn&#x27;t ever attempt to use it on my hair, but I&#x27;m a female that requires more style then a buzz cut.</li>
    <li> So far this product works well. I did drop one of the attachments and a piece of it broke; the attachment construction is pretty flimsy but if you manage not to drop any of them they work great. Even the one I did drop works well.  The actual unit has a good weight but, I find, it has a slightly ackward shape.  Other than that I have been pleased with the product; granted I have only used it twice...</li>
    <li> Good value for price.  Other Wahl Clipper&#x27;s offer i or 2 more pieces  which are usless and charge abour 5 bucks more, but clipper is the same. So far clipper works well.  I&#x27;m the only one using it and I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> I got this with some trepidation. My wife has no experience cutting hair and, even though I prefer a very simple cut, I had my doubts. This cutter was so easy to use, however, that I need not have feared. The instructions were simple and clear and the clippers work well. They were inexpensive and it seems that after two more cuts, these things will pay for themselves.</li>
    <li> used once and works fine.  several of the pieces do not fit properly on the clipper which causes it to rattle and be extremely loud.  although after one more clip it will have already paid for itself.</li>
    <li> I thought we&#x27;d upgrade our home clippers and get these since they seemed a little better quality than the ones we already. They did not cut cleanly, I had to go over the same spot many times.  These also vibrated so loudly that it hurt my hubby&#x27;s hearing and I had to return them.</li>
    <li> This clip and trim kit is great.  It has everything included.  (The kit I received had a broken clip which was intended to hold the clippers in place.  As a result it shifted around during shipping which caused the oil to leak out.  BUT there was no damage, it just needed to be wiped off). They work excellent.</li>
    <li> Damn good trimmer. I used it for years, and it did a nice job. I shave my head now, so I use this on rare occasions. You can throw away all the different filters and heads and just use the naked blade, and it works fine. Cheaper here than at CVS.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair clipper some time now and it is a quality product.  Can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve used it but with all the attachments, I cut my own hair and it looks pretty presentable.  At about $6.50 per haircut, I&#x27;ve saved a good deal of cash.  Jack A.</li>
    <li> Okay, so these are the loudest clippers I have ever heard. I live in a Marine Barracks and everyone is able to hear the thing all the way down the hall. I had to buy new clippers just a month later because I couldn&#x27;t stand the loud noise coming from these. Save your money and buy a different model. Trust me.</li>
    <li> its a great product, I&#x27;m glad I bought it, it does what its meant to do.. and great.:)</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my husband&#x27;s hair for 37 years with Wahl clippers.  This is the third set over all these years, so that should speak for their quality and durability.  I&#x27;m just as pleased as ever with this new set.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Solid built. 23 pieces all together which can make it of a great use. Competitive price as well. Overall very satisfied with this product and would recommend it to someone else as well.</li>
    <li> I was a bit surprised with this item. I have had clippers made by this company in the past and they were always very good. Maybe the price-point is too low to create a quality product! My gripes with the item are like this: First, the item comes in a decent case, but all of the attachments are thrown in like junk. So the case is no more useful that a plastic bag. The attachments themselves seem horribly cheap. Some had flash on the clips and would not clip on correctly until I fixed them with an exacto-knife. The scissors are pretty much the ones you can get in a package of 3 at a dollar store. The clipper itself has a ragged and poorly molded plastic enclosure. When I tested it, the fine-trimmer apparatus on the back of the clipper rattles VERY loudly! One tester was happy to wear earplugs when using it.....not me. I assumed that they had an engineer design this thing, and then tested it. I would guess that is an incorrect assumption. I had my wife try it out without telling her about the noise, and she asked if it was broken. Enough said on that subject! So, back to amazon it went. I understand that it is not an expensive item, but it is no excuse to put out junk. I decided to order a similar clipper without the fine-trimmer. Oddly enough, I bought a cheapo conair clipper for $12.99 (as a temporary clipper) at another retailer and it is a pretty high quality item. So, it can be made at a low cost........</li>
    <li> I got this because I was impressed with everything it came with for such a low price.I used it for the first time today and it is awful. It is so loud!! I had to put duct tape over the trimmer area to keep it from being so loud. My son was scared of the noise so I had to do something. The plastic attachments are junk!! The are so flimsy when you start clipping the hair they bend to the side and don&#x27;t stay in place.Seriously the best thing about this whole kit was the cape it came with, worked well keeping my son hair free.</li>
    <li> Pros: Fits in case, completeness, cost  Cons: Noise, thin plastic case  I had to return this product before I could try it because the noise created by this clipper is so unnaturally loud it scared me and the person I was going to trim up. I felt uncomfortable and so did they. Listen to the reviews because this clipper is very loud.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I bough this set around 6 years ago and haven&#x27;t been to a barber since. I&#x27;ve taken proper maintenance with the set, and i&#x27;m using it roughly 3 times a month for cutting my and my kids hair. Still runs great, and I will not hesitate to buy a replacement when it eventually dies.</li>
    <li> I bought this set a few weeks ago.  I finally neeed a haircut the other did, and these did the job very well.  It&#x27;s definitely worth the low cost because it doesn&#x27;t seem like there&#x27;s an detectable drop-off in quality from the haircuts I would get at the barber shop.  They work very effectively, so this is really a very worthwhile bargain if you can get it for about 20 bucks like i did.  I&#x27;ll probably save at least 100 bucks over the course of the year on haircuts.</li>
    <li> Not much to say here. Everyone knows the Wahl brand is a great brand! The clippers themselves feel very durable (although a very TINY piece of the trimmer part of the clippers broke off, it&#x27;s no biggie.) and cut hair REALLY REALLY smoothly! I mean, this thing GLIDES! I am very pleased with this. The extras it comes with are very useful. As with any clippers, it comes with guards for different heights of hair, as well as, special guards for the ears. It also comes with cleaning supplies for the clippers, oil, and a barber cape (really neat!) which means no more getting NAKED because you don&#x27;t want your clothes resembling that of a caveman&#x27;s backside!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue for me really, is the trimmers. They hardly, and I mean, HARDLY trim much at all. These trimmers are just like an afterthought compared to the splendid quality of everything else! I tried using them to shape up my hairlines after I cut my hair and all I was doing was scraping my skull with the blades. It BARELY made a straight line on my forehead. It was just a painful and disappointing experience because I really expected these trimmers to save me the trouble of actually buying trimmers separately. But, oh well. At least you do get some really nice clippers. But for that barbershop cut with \\&quot;razor sharp\\&quot; sideburns/hairlines, you will have to spend some extra money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Excellent Clippers&lt;br /&gt;- Very Useful Extras/Attachments&lt;br /&gt;- Extremely Durable &amp; Heavy Feel&lt;br /&gt;- Up To The \\&quot;Wahl\\&quot; Reputation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Terrible Trimmer</li>
    <li> It was average,but the quality on the material was lacking.Real plastic that will shatter if drop.Often its not what you see,don&#x27;t get.</li>
    <li> We give many hair cuts at home (so much cheaper)!  This is a great versatile tool kit to take on those \\&quot;new-dos\\&quot;.  Would highly recommend.  Easy to use.  Clean up isn&#x27;t too bad either.</li>
    <li> bought one set for my self picked up  two more for my childrens kids. these are great will cut through almost any hair from long to short. a great buy.</li>
    <li> Encouraged by the nice reviews about the Wahl 79900, I was excited to open the package. However, there were short pieces of hair within the clipper set box and in the blades of the clipper itself. This was gross and totally unexpected as it was not supposed to be \\&quot;used\\&quot;!!</li>
    <li> It is everything it claims to be. A wonderful, easy to understand and useful product.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with how this product worked.  My two sons, ages 8 &amp; 4 appreciated the smooth haircut with no hurting.  As others had mentioned, the cape is cheesy and my 4 yr old ripped it off his neck at the end of the haircut.  I was pleased with the variety in attachments.  The barber shears were very tough to operate.  I ended up using my good scissors.</li>
    <li> These clippers work great.  Be careful with the supposed ear trimmer guards.  You will mess up good work in a hurry.  I&#x27;m not experienced at cutting hair and neither is the wife but it has been easy with the right tool.  Clippers seem very durable and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son who is a college swimmer.  His entire team used it for the annual \\&quot;shave down\\&quot; party.  He said it was easy to use and worked great.</li>
    <li> Well the product is not cheap, the product itself is cheap, the cutter shakes when it&#x27;s working making unbearable noise. The haircut kit is not strong enough to maintain its shape when I put it against my head. Thus I need to be super careful not to make a mess. It took me half an hour to finish cutting half of my hair and the result is so bad that I would rather be bald. I then turned to my friends cutter which is Panasonic and finish the remaining half in ten minutes. What a rubbish product this is!!</li>
    <li> I have used a Wahl clipper with the numbered guides like this for many years to cut the hair of my four boys. It is reliable and always does a great job. I save at least $350 a year, and the guys look great. Takes about 20 minutes at home (I do a scissor cut on top after clipping the sides, but it&#x27;s even quicker when you clip the whole head)... and that beats having to drive somewhere, wait in line, pay at least 15 bucks and drive home (and then sometimes having to get out the clipper anyway to correct the paid-for haircut)!</li>
    <li> It had more than 8 guide combs which was very nice for me.  Ive tried using it once, and so far the clipper itself also works well.</li>
    <li> The Clippers work really well. The trimmer isn&#x27;t that great but it works. 5 stars</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s always nice replacing an old appliance with a new one.  This razor functioned better new than our old one did.  Oh yea, the service was good too.</li>
    <li> This is great. It pays for itself quickly, and my haircut went effortlessly.     No pulled hairs -- this is definitely a nice cutter, and I appreciate the effort that went into it. The price just went down too! I think I paid $29 on amazon. But worth it regardless of the price. One thing, sometimes it&#x27;s confusing finding the blades because they&#x27;re all black. Would be nice to have a multicolored one.    And also-- no battery charger!! This is definitely annoying, but not too bad, since I live in a cold climate and wouldn&#x27;t be able to cut my hair outside for 8 months of the year.</li>
    <li> These are great clippers!. Bought a set for my grandkids and they worked so good, I ordered another set for my husband.</li>
    <li> this is a great hair-cut kit;it has everything you need to cut,trim,shape...you name it!and the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> This was a nice kit.  The trimmers were a little heavy and, despite feeling solid, they did brake after being dropped.  We did replace them with another Wahl set and even still use many of the items from this kit with the new trimmers.</li>
    <li> I bought this to give my son haircuts because he would get upset when he got haircuts from haircuts places for toddlers.  He still doesn&#x27;t like them, but at least there is no public spectacle.  The money I saved has already paid for the clippers.</li>
    <li> Product described perfect.  Wish it would have been shipped faster but it was free so I guess you can have everything!</li>
    <li> Very useful, use for both my lil sons, who refuse to go to salon to get their hair cut.  So we use this in the backyard and they get a Lollypop afterwards .  Have done at least 1/2 dozen haircuts on them each...been great so far....</li>
    <li> Great clippers for the price. Lots of power to cut -  they don&#x27;t bog down. The attachments provide the guides I need to do a good cutting job. I recomend this set.    Del</li>
    <li> This is my very first clipper kit and I am quite impressed with the performance 4 hair cuts later. I would reccommend this product to anyone searching for the most economical buy with great results.</li>
    <li> Our hair clipper of 25+ years finally died and I was anxious about replacement. (especially when only viewed over an internet site.)  When it came, it was all that was described and more.  The cut is perfect, it is quiet to operate and comes with a wide variety of attachments. I would highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> It is a very nice clippers it has paid for &lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s self all ready. &lt;br /&gt;My son grandson and husband have all had a hair cut with &lt;br /&gt;the clippers and it did a very nige job &lt;br /&gt;ERma</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair (what&#x27;s left of it), and this is perfect for me.  The clipper is strong and cuts very well, and rarely ever pulls out my hair.    I don&#x27;t love the attached close trimmer, it tends to be a little flimsy and a little awkward to use.  Also, some of the length attachments seem to just be for show... I can&#x27;t imagine anyone buzzing their hair on the longer settings... doesn&#x27;t really seem to have a point.  The scissor isn&#x27;t terrific, but you&#x27;re not buying this for the scissor... think of it more as an extra.    The set, as a whole, does a great job... and has saved me a whole lot of money.</li>
    <li> This haircut set is worthy. Easy to cut hair following instructions. Paid off with the first two cuts and its going to save me hundreds of dollars in haircuts</li>
    <li> My husband has been cutting his hair for several years and had an older Wahl set but really needed a newer, sharper set. We researched a little and found this set was a nice set for the price. It works great and included several size trimmer combs and other accessories too. Works like it&#x27;s suppose too with just average noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pleased with our purchase and recommend it.</li>
    <li> What a great trimmer this is.  I don&#x27;t have much hair and it was still costing me $20 every time I went to a barber.  My wife now cuts my hair with this trimmer, and you really can&#x27;t tell the difference.  This thing has paid for itself 10 times over already.  Compact case, doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room, worth every penny I paid.</li>
    <li> The detail trimmer is of plastic and the mechanism is not of good quality. It does not serve hte purpose of a detail trimmer. i intend to go for hte Wahl 79524-1001 Deluxe Chrome Pro with Multi-Cut Clipper &amp; Trimmer, 27 Pieces</li>
    <li> I love this product, but it&#x27;s really not so easy to cut your own hair. I was doing swell with the #2 clipper, but then I got the bright idea of trying to fade the back of my neck with the #1 clipper. I ended up going a little too high and basically gave myself a high and tight. Decided that since I have been out of the military since &#x27;97, I might as well do the rest of my head with the #1 clipper. Britney has nothing on me now!    Still, in all honesty, this is a great product. It&#x27;s really easy to do a professional job on what you can see. I just advise getting someone to get the back.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00008BNZ4 Wahl 79900 Clip-N-Trim 23-Piece Clipper Kit]]    I cut my 2 year old son&#x27;s hair with this and have loved it ever since. It is very easy to use, you will never go wrong with this.</li>
    <li> Its a very robust tool! is heavy and very noisy, but works great.    As a bad thing... he plastic part of the detail trimmer is cracked.    i prefer to spend a little more money for a more light and silent trimmer.</li>
    <li> This is a great haircut, I use it once a month from 2007 and is still workng very well, you must remember when you store you haircut tha need some oil to prevent damage.</li>
    <li> i bought this so i can maintain my beard and hair. they give you multiple clips which allows you to choose your hair length and also provides a nice line when using it for a shape up.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve only used this once so far, but were very happy with the product&#x27;s performance.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been over one year now, and the shaver is working great! We&#x27;ve used it probably 10 times or so, and it seems durable to me. Buy this--it&#x27;s way cheaper than going to the salon/barber and having to shell out way too much money on a haircut.</li>
    <li> Gr8 product, with multiple attachments. Perfect for personal use. A value product for sure. Working perfectly fine, no issues with me.</li>
    <li> Wahl 79900N Clip-N-Trim   I have to agree with one of the other reviewers that the detail trimmer is not the best quality.   It&#x27;s flimsy and doesn&#x27;t clip on like the other attachments.   It takes fiddling to get it to work and the plastic seems like it will break eventually.     The case that it comes in is roomier that the last wahl I had but again the quality is subpar.   The plastic pieces are used to hold the clipper/trimmer unit was broken off with this unit and 1st one I received.   Also the first 79900N that arrived looked like it had been opened and tampered with before I received it.   The level attachments have been &#x27;downgraded&#x27; from the older version that I had, the plastic is more flimsy and thinner.  With that said, the clipper itself seems like a decent economy item.</li>
    <li> I have owned this model for a couple of years and it has been used many times. We now have \\&quot;haircut night\\&quot; where it gets used for several haircuts in a row. It is starting to shows signs of slowing down, in really thick hair. Time to buy a new one so why mess around,  this one was so good I have bought another.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Angelo \\&quot;the town barber \\&quot; must hate these things..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the unit 3 times, and the flip-over trimmer broke when I \\&quot;flipped\\&quot; it over to attach to the main clipper head. The plastic attachment for the flip over trimmer is supposed to fit over the main head, that cracked in two, and about 8 pieces scattered on the floor. It&#x27;s very disappointing. I&#x27;m hoping the rest of the unti will perform for longer, I can&#x27;t seem to find the receipt.</li>
    <li> OK, we&#x27;ll admit that we were pretty apprehensive about having my wife start cutting my hair, until good friends told us that the wife had been cutting her husband&#x27;s hair for years and it was very easy. For approx. $27.00, we figured what the heck..if it worked, we would pay off the kit in just 2 haircuts.And if it didn&#x27;t work well, it&#x27;s only hair and will grow back. I never get my hair styled, just cut rather short. This kit works like a dream. Even the first haircut my wife gave me was better then many cuts I&#x27;ve gotten by professionals. It&#x27;s pretty much mistake proof, just start cutting longer and work back to as short as desired. I&#x27;ve never attempted to cut my own hair, although I don&#x27;t really see where that would be much of a problem either, just start longer and work back. I highly reccommend this kit. Personally, 23 pieces are too much for me: I could get away with much less accessories. I don&#x27;t want to put any barbers out of business but they won&#x27;t be seeing me for a long, long time.</li>
    <li> Have used a couple other similar products, but none intensively.  This meets my needs adequately, but may not be enough for some people with more demanding requirements.</li>
    <li> The clipper vibrates and makes humming sound.  Not so loud, but still not ignorable. The conair is much quieter.  The cutting is fine. Does the job as intended.   Don&#x27;t think of returning this one.</li>
    <li> This complete haircut kit is useful and resolve a lot things in a beaty supply, it was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> The clipper itself works great. Yes, it is a little loud, but it&#x27;s an electric hair clipper. I would not expect it to be whisper-quiet any more than I would expect a silent lawn mower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My clipper arrived with one of the guide combs missing teeth. I emailed Wahl and immediately got a response that a replacement was being sent; no back and forth, no climbing the CSR ladder and having the blame moved to Amazon. Immediate action and great customer service.</li>
    <li> Best investment I&#x27;ve made.  Wife cuts my hair and I&#x27;ve saved enough to buy 10 of these.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a bit more at Walmart becuase I needed it asap. My hair grows back at an incredible rate and if I don&#x27;t trim it within 2-3 weeks, it looks BAD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model featured a Powerdrive system that&#x27;s supposedly more powerful at cutting thick hair more smoothly. It also sports this special detail trimmer that pops out and attaches to the trimmer blade like a silencer for a rifle. The only difference is that it makes 3 times more noise than the regular trimmer. It was so loud I couldn&#x27;t stand it buzzing next to my ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried oiling it to no avail, it&#x27;s just very noisy and vibrates a lot. The regular trimmer is just like the old Wahl I had. In fact this trimmer looks and feels JUST like the old Wahl I had from the mid 90s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t feel any difference in how smoothly it cut - it just got really hot really quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s new and it has a 5 year warranty. It would pay for itself in the 3rd or 4th haircut at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After the 3rd cutting, the trimmer appears to be slightly quieter and doesn&#x27;t get as hot.&lt;br /&gt;I oiled the blades and made sure it was clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small trimmer attachment got a bit quieter but I found that if I just wear earplugs I can handle the noise. No Big deal at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair trimmer already paid for itself and I&#x27;m getting really nice and clean haircuts by myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;After about the 10th use, the longer trimmer guides vibrate and the smaller \\&quot;fuzz hair\\&quot; adapter vibrates right off of the main trimmer body.&lt;br /&gt;It still cuts great for such an inexpensive trimmer. It does the job of an industrial strength trimmer and after about 3 haircuts, it pays for itself. I can pretty much get a brand new trimmer set each year and still save over going to a hair salon/barber shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hairstyle isn&#x27;t complicated: Guide #4 for the top, Guide #1 for the sides. High and tight. I see no reason to pay a barber ten dollars to do the same thing.</li>
    <li> I could not be more happy with this trimmer. It cuts very well and feels much more sturdy than any other trimmer I held when shopping around. The cutting blades are solid metal screwed to the body; the power switch turns on with a meaty, satisfying click; and the plastic guide combs snap on snugly. I agree with other reviewers that the detail trimmer seems superfluous, but it, too, works well.</li>
    <li> I am pretty much satified with this clipper and trimmer combo.&lt;br /&gt;The barber wont see my husband and kids for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;My husband has really coarse hair and my kids hair is fine an wavy&lt;br /&gt;and it does a good job on all of them.&lt;br /&gt;It is affordable and you can save a lot of money, seeing how my husband&lt;br /&gt;is in the air force and he needs a nice hair cut atleast every 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing i am not that satisfied with is the trimmer, it is not&lt;br /&gt;as sharp as it could be, but since i still had a good trimmer it is ok.</li>
    <li> I like this and I&#x27;m satisfied. It does not support dual voltage so you can&#x27;t take it in Asia and Europe. The main device is good and well built and cuts hair well. This product is very good if you maintain short hair. For normal hair, you need to divide your head in different areas and change the clips accordingly. A small mistake can make your friends laugh at you. Don&#x27;t do it yourself otherwise you&#x27;ll end up with a weird hair style. Always ask somebody to have your hair cut. The motor makes a little noise which made me think that it&#x27;s powerful.    EDIT: I have been using it for almost 3 years and it still works almost like before. I&#x27;m happy that I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Definetly cheap, but you can buy a more expensive version which will pay for itself too. noisy. gets hot easily. side trimmer is useless. catches onto hair if you go a little bit faster, and that is so annoying. I&#x27;m buying a different one.</li>
    <li> Realizing that my haircut isn&#x27;t the most complicated thing in the world, I decided to buy a pair of clippers to see if it could be done at home.  I bought this pair of Wahl clippers because I already own another Wahl product, and I wanted to make sure I had a quality clippers.  Let me tell you, these Made in the USA clippers are fantastic.  This baby has some meat to it - its not some light, cheap feeling clipper.  I have no doubts this clipper will last for years.  The numerous attachments and other accessories that come in this package are great as well, allowing you to cut your hair to anywhere from straight buzz to about 1\\&quot; long (my length using the #8 head).  Very easy to use either by yourself with an inexperienced significant other.  I will never have to go to the barber again, and that is a great feeling.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful clipper set the blades are sharp and the motor is not at all loud, as described by another reviewer. I was a bit trouble by that review, but I am very glad I now purchased the clip-n-trim set. I have already performed 3 haircuts on my little ones and will be on my second round soon.  In other words I have already passed the pays-for-itself point and now on the money saving round. I have used only the trimmer on myself (sideburns) and it is just as quiet as the regular trimmer.  The unit states that it is made in America, which is a big plus because this keeps our manufacturing going.  Yes, its just a clipper set, but everything counts in small amounts. Scissors are a bit on the feeling flimsy side, but have so far cut very well with out pulling or grabbing same as the clipper.  I am not a barber of any sort so my cuts are basically bowl style in nature, but for little kids what else do they need. Again, I am very  happy with this purchase and hope to get to the point of possibly convincing my wife to let me cut her hair.  This will be a long way off, however.</li>
    <li> We had a simple kit that lasted nearly 4 years of bi-monthly haircuts.  I didn&#x27;t have any complaints until we tried this one!  Remarkable!  It did not overheat, which was a concern when cutting our toddler&#x27;s hair &amp; it doesn&#x27;t take repeated attempts to get the hair off.    No complaints.</li>
    <li> I bought my set of WAHL clippers after my old set went dead after 10 years of service.  This set works just as good as my old ones and with the bonus of the trimmer makes this a must have.</li>
    <li> I love it as it is easy to use and the quality is amazing. I would recommend this anyone looking to buy haircut kit.</li>
    <li> Well over a year later and I&#x27;m still using this device for all types of body hair and it works great. Strong motor, good attachments, and no worries of a dying battery.</li>
    <li> I just have someone in my house give me a quick buzz cut and this WAHL clipper works great and its pretty cheap too... I&#x27;ve had this a little over three years and its still working great... i would recommend it for simple cuts like mine</li>
    <li> Paid for itself after three uses.  It&#x27;s great. :)</li>
    <li> This trimmer works well. Just a little loud. But has great attachments. And many of them. The scissors were not that good.But the quality and performance are great.</li>
    <li> Product was very easy to use - my fiance trimmed my hair in about 15 minutes on her first try.  The accessory clips come in a variety of sizes.  One recommendation - don&#x27;t bother using the plastic (trash bag) apron, just get your hair trimmed and take a shower!</li>
    <li> I bought this since my haircut is pretty simple.  Slap on a #3 guard and go.  My wife is cutting my hair with this now and hasn&#x27;t had any problems with it.  It also saves me $20 every time I get my hair cut so it&#x27;s definitely worth the investment.  The only problems I have with it is that it&#x27;s not very easy to clean up and the included apron thing is pretty much useless.  Other than that, it cuts well and even has pretty good instructions included.</li>
    <li> This Wahl Complete Haircut Kit replaced a 10-year-old set of clippers.  What a major difference!  This Wahl Kit even has trimmers for around the ear and for eyebrows.  It has enough attachments for hair of all lengths.  The clippers are very quiet and efficient.  When my hair was done it looked very close to what my barber does.  Just after two uses you will pay for this.  It is a very good deal and it is well worth buying.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It is the best one which I ever have ha, but its problem is its sound and vibration. Unfortunately, it is high, but as a whole it is acceptable.</li>
    <li> Cheap trimmer with a lot of extras, but the overall quality of the parts is pretty poor... The plastic parts for the length adjustment were bent after using them for like 3 times. I would recommand to go for a more expensive product, if you plan to use it regularly...</li>
    <li> This is my first pair of clippers, but they were easy to figure out and easy to use.  I buzzed my husband&#x27;s hair right off!  :-)</li>
    <li> Just got my Wahl 23-piece haircut kit today, ripped it open, and cut my 3 year old&#x27;s hair.  It was great!  I was pretty concerned after reading reviews about the noise since both my kids are extremely sensitive to noises, but it didn&#x27;t bother either of them.  Considering that they flee the room when I even grind coffee, I really don&#x27;t consider the Wahl to be that loud.  It was easy to use and the instructions were great!  I was doing so well, that I got a little careless and sliced his ear, but other than that, I was pretty amazed at how good the haircut looks. I&#x27;ve seen some pretty sloppy do-it-yourself cuts, but I don&#x27;t think you can tell his hair wasn&#x27;t done by a salon for the outrageous price of $16.  Yay!    For those considering home haircut kit for the first time, the Wahl was great for us and you can&#x27;t beat the price!  Two cuts and it will have paid for itself.  Plus I like having the option to do touchups on the long hair over the ears.  And I can shave my hubby&#x27;s neck and eyebrows!  Haha.</li>
    <li> my first hair clipper. bought this clipper a week ago, and now have already used it twice. and those are my first and second time that i cut my hair by myself(buzz cut). .just giving you my background about self-haircutting and Hair clippers. now on to my review.    its darn cheap. but its not poorly made. how do i know? well right after using it for the first time, i put it on top of my counter somewhere near the edge of it(dumb decision). then i accidentally knocked it off the edge. the hair clipper fell (about the same elevation as the typical bathroom sink maybe 3ft). i check the clippers for cracks, broken parts and what not, but i saw none. i turned it on and nothing weird happened, still worked just like the first time i used it. in short this product is durable.    another thing that i like about this product is that it comes with a small case. so you can just dump all of its attachments, manuals, the clipper itself etc. in there and not worry about somethin being misplaced. and it looks neat, and easy to carry with you.     the attachments were ok. it fits snug. nothing fancy. its just plastic. it works tho. the clipper oil that come with it was very little. its got towel provided, but i didnt even bother to open it coz i have a bigger one ready. the manual was great, everything you need to know is there. it even has a instruction on how to do a certain haircut, i didnt follow it. i just used #2 guide the for rest of my hair and i was done.    performance-wise, i thought it was great. it cut my hair like nothing, well because its new but i will update in the future. its got that flip-over trimmer, never saw the opportunity to use it..     it is Noisy, but not the noisiest clipper i&#x27;ve heard. The vibration depends on how you hold it(just learned this one). hold it somewhere in the middle part and your hand might fell numb because of the vibration is darn strong. hold it where its supposed to be held and the vibration will be tolerable. its kinda heavy too.to summarize i thought i bought the right hair clipper for me. its got what i wanted in a hair clipper, cheap, well built, reliable, simple. its a great invetment, and will definitely save you lots of money.</li>
    <li> Woah, I bought this a while ago! It&#x27;s been...4 years?? The whole kit still works great! Nothing bad to say here. Wahl is the standard for a reason, it seems.</li>
    <li> I cut a few men&#x27;s hair and this is a great machine!  this is my third one, the first 2 still work, but I dropped the 3rd one so this is a replacement...</li>
    <li> I bought mine in 2009 from the K store. It still going strong. However, my nephew&#x27;s hair is thick and curly and it sometimes snags on his hair. I have curly hair but not as thick as his. On my hair is fine. Needs more torque but for the price it s ag odd deal. The scissors are just adequate. The combs barely adequate as well to.</li>
    <li> I brought this set about six month ago and has used it for a few times. It gets the job done, nicely at this price, and that&#x27;s why I would give 4 stars for it. The issue so far is that the trimmer (which has been criticized by some other users): it is very fragilely connected to the clipper. To make things worse, the clipper will produce a very loud noise when the trimmer part is connected. I discovered this problem and removed the trimmer permanently; problem solved! I would suggest the producer improve the design about the trimmer part (or maybe just simply remove it!) which is really useless and sometimes can be really annoying.     At this price, I&#x27;m happy enough to have such a sturdy tool to save money on my haircut. If you are looking for something economic to cut your hair, this can be what you are looking for!</li>
    <li> Come in a very nice hard case.  Has a long cord.  It replaces a Conair cordless that didn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> Theses are great clippers. I&#x27;ve had many different brands of clippers and Wahl is defiantly the way to go. This particular clipper has a detailing blade that flips up from the body of the clippers and attaches over the blade for smaller detailing. It also include ear guards that are angles for that clean fade over the ear. It also includes an eye brow trimmer. This came with a lot more guards then I was expecting and it&#x27;s very good quality. I WOULD DEFIANTLY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE CUTTING THIER HAIR THIER CHILDREN&#x27;S HAIR OR EVEN IN THE BUSINESS!! I am very impressed and satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I bought it as Christmas gift for my son. He used it immediately.  He cutbhis hair in a very easy manner.  It has an instructions manual.  The most important is the price, very reasonable.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used these clippers to cut hair for a few months, and they are pretty good. Some people said they were loud, but I did not think mine were any louder than other clippers I have heard. Nice all around section of guards for different trim lengths.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a Wahl Peanut Clipper for years, but I wanted to wear my hair a little longer and the Peanut only has 4 attachments, all rather close cutting.  I decided to give this one a try because of the variety of attachments and cutting depths.  It&#x27;s taking some adjustment getting use to the heavier feel, but it performs well.  And though it is a bit louder, it&#x27;s nothing outrageous.  However, I did mark it down one star because the barber cape is very thin and cheap.</li>
    <li> Works and keeps working year in, year out. Buy these and you can cut your hair without any help, save a mirror.</li>
    <li> Great kit, has everything I need. It&#x27;s not loud, blade is sharp (no pulling), and feels solidly built in the hand. Bonus, it&#x27;s made in USA.</li>
    <li> Purchased this Wahl clipper set to replace one.  The clippers work fine, and this set has a few extra guards the other set did not, enabling me to get the haircut I want without taking too much off the top and looking bald.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the kit once, and it did what it was supposed to.  No problems, everything went fine, and I intend to use it again within about a month.  It should pay for itself very quickly.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd Wahl set (first one lasted from 2003 to early 2014) and it&#x27;s just a good as the first set. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;ll last over 10 years but if it lasts just half as long, I&#x27;ll be a happy customer.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my son-in-law.  He is a soldier in the U.S. Army.  He loves it because he can cut his own hair very, very short.  It is also very popular with other soldiers in his outfit, they keep borrowing it.  If you want to send a soldier a gift, send one of theses. Tested and approved by U.S. Army soldiers.</li>
    <li> Not the greatest clippers on the market, but for the price they are good enough.</li>
    <li> Absolutely pleased.  Great for beard trim also.  I&#x27;ve never been displeased with Wahl</li>
    <li> So far I like the item.  I talked to a sylist and they said that I got a good buy.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my father and he really likes it. it does a great job in cutting hair. Although, I would prefer that manufacturer will sell this item with fewer pieces for hair trimming. Very often 90% of them not needed.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is that I would definitely recommend this item to anybody!</li>
    <li> best one ever bought compared to other brand bought, easy and managable this shavier is well.</li>
    <li> Excellent, used it for many years now. It keeps working</li>
    <li> Some say it is loud, but it is only really loud when the clipper attachments are not really set in properly.  I admit that the trimmer which clicks on the blade for fine work IS noisey, and I guess some folks are more sensitive than others to certain sounds.  Loud - a little.  Too much so, not for me.   This is my second Wahl - my first still works - but this one had all the trimmings.  The cloak thing is really cheap - it is like a trash can bag with string.  Everything else, however, is pretty good stuff.  No problems and will keep buying Wahl whose products seem to last forever which is refreshing in an age where everything seems to break within 18 months or so.  Good work Wahl.</li>
    <li> It cuts great but very very loud. I  had to use ear plug. I already used it twice and compare to what they charge for the hair cut today, it&#x27;s already paid off.</li>
    <li> I have save so many money cutting myself and relatives, a usefull tool that everyone MUST have home, It is so loud and the plastic is chaep but still cutting like new that is the most important feature, if you could buy a expensive one I recommend doing so maybe the plastics would be more solid.</li>
    <li> My husband begged me to get this and start giving him home hair cuts.  I was very reluctant.  The Wahl Clip-N-Trim came with an instruction guide (which I read at least six times). I simply followed the guide, snapping on the suggested guides as I moved from back, sides, middle and top.  The Clip-N-Trim is easy to use, and gives a good cut. A good tool at a good price.</li>
    <li> This has been working well for almost three years.  It needs cleaning and oil as all clippers do.  I like it.</li>
    <li> The Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Wahl makes a good steel blade. It cuts well, and has never snagged, jammed, or gummed up (unlike cheaper clippers).&lt;br /&gt;2) Good motor on this. The electric motor is reliable and I&#x27;ve never had any problems with it in 5 years of ownership. My father has had a Wahl for 30 years, and it&#x27;s still on it&#x27;s original motor too. These things last.&lt;br /&gt;3) Good selection of guide combs.&lt;br /&gt;4) Main blade is adjustable so you can use it to shave all the way down to the skin (trim carefully though, if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing you can end up scratching your skin because the blade IS sharp).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) The guide combs are cheap and will vibrate on the blade. This doesn&#x27;t affect the cutting ability, but it makes a TON of noise. The only solution is to wrap your thumb over the back of the guide comb to keep it from vibrating while you cut your own hair, or wrap your index finger over it if cutting someone else&#x27;s hair. This keeps it from vibrating needlessly and cuts down on the noise significantly.&lt;br /&gt;2) The accessory scissors are small, awkward, and poorly made. Don&#x27;t use them to cut your hair. A regular pair of school scissors work better and cost like $5.&lt;br /&gt;3) The hair comb is cheap too, but functional at least.&lt;br /&gt;4) the &amp;#34;precision trimmer&amp;#34; is basically useless. It doesn&#x27;t cut as well as the main blade so I never use it. It feels cheap though so if I did use it, I feel like it would break easily.&lt;br /&gt;5) This thing will get HOT if you use it for too long. I&#x27;ve used it pretty heavily and many times have had it on for over an hour at a time with only short cleaning breaks. With that kind of usage, the case becomes quite toasty. Not quite painfully hot, but close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a fine product. Wahl is THE name in hair clippers, and the most important elements (blade and motor) live up to that name. Some higher-quality accessories would have been nice, but it works, so I won&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!! I have used the kit for about two years so far and everything still work very well. Very easy to use!</li>
    <li> This is the only trimmer I&#x27;ve used so I can&#x27;t compare it.  However I&#x27;ve been using it for two years giving two hair cuts a month and it&#x27;s worked perfectly the whole time.  Nothing has broken on it, it&#x27;s easy to clean and maintain.  It&#x27;s saved out family a ton of money!</li>
    <li> I use these all the time on my husband and he loves them! They don&#x27;t pull his hair and they are exactly what he was looking for as far as professional hair clippers!</li>
    <li> For the money......a great product, use it once or twice and it&#x27;s paid for itself</li>
    <li> Great product to cut your hair with.  Clipper stays sharp and cuts hair great.  Has lots of attachments.  Would purchase a Wahl again</li>
    <li> This trimmer set makes giving yourself a haircut fairly easy. I like being in control of cutting my hair just the length I like it and I can maintain the perfect length in minutes. The Wahl trimmer unit is heavy duty, looks like it will last forever and the attachments for determining hair length just snap on. I bought it just after getting a regular haircut 4 weeks ago and I have already used it three times to maintain the length I like.</li>
    <li> The clipper arrived intact. All the parts and instructions were there. Being a first time user it took me a while to understand the instructions. But I quickly got the hang of it after doing my first haircut. So far I&#x27;ve given two haircuts to my boys, and I&#x27;m really pleased with the clipper&#x27;s performance. The price was right. More importantly, it has already paid for itself.</li>
    <li> It works fine. I did not find it noisy or pulling hair, as one or two earlier reviewers had said. Works great and is good value for money.</li>
    <li> Was looking into buying a hair trimmer at a competitive price since my old one has died on me.  I looked around on Amazon for what would be a good trimmer based on customer reviews.  I read plenty of reviews that reported customers buying NEW trimmers from Amazon but unfortunately, they were receiving USED trimmers.  I took the gamble, what are the chances right?  First thing I did when I got the trimmer was look for hair and skin follicles.  I am unhappy to say that I found plenty of hair and skin and was actually happy to have received a used trimmer because this will be the last time I buy any home or personal use item from Amazon.  I kept the trimmer because I needed it that day, so I just disinfected it.  If Amazon only cared enough to sell what they say they sell, they could keep a loyal customer base.  They have officially lost a lot of $$$$ from me, and that&#x27;s too bad.</li>
    <li> I cannot provide a full review of this clipper because Amazon sent me a used one.  It was pretty gross to see hair stubs.  However repackaged tried their best to make it look new.  As for the item, I cannot use it.  However from observation, there is a broken plastic piece on the lid for the trimmer.</li>
    <li> I bought this item to reduce the barbershop costs. If you use it with the oil it won&#x27;t be so noisy, the problem is that the clips are cheap made and the make an annoying sound when on the trimmer.    My came with hair on it, as if it was \\&quot;TESTED\\&quot;, i could&#x27;t believe what my eyes were seen. I used some products to disinfect it before use.    I have used it 4 times now so i can say it,s a good item because of the price.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely manner, but is a Christmas Gift and has not yet been used.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so heavy and solid that there is no excuse for a short to develop in the power button.  This is not a complicated electrical device.  I hate throwing it away. And Now Costco sells the same model with a small trimmer, for about 25% less.</li>
    <li> Works great and the Wahl is priced just right and I would buy again.  Thanks Wahl and I&#x27;ll be back when needing a replacement.</li>
    <li> Works great, no problems.  It&#x27;s industrial-strength heavy, and while I don&#x27;t plan on dropping it, I would bet the trimmer (not counting the plastic heads) could survive quite a bit of abuse.</li>
    <li> the 23 pieces consists of mostly clip on depth guides ... not sure how many ... around 12 of them ... you really only need like 5 at best. The scissors are cheap. The clippers are good for shaving your head and giving yourself a buzz cut with an 1/8&amp;#34; depth guide. I use them every two weeks and for that they work perfectly. I never pay for a haircut.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a very long time and it works great! The cost of this item was only about the cost of two haircuts and I have used it at least a dozen times.</li>
    <li> i m still using this product , i was bought this one on 2010 , and still working good so that is great , its good product ,, thanks</li>
    <li> We have had this for 6 years or so, and good as the day it was purchased. Great pricing, and great for our needs</li>
    <li> My friend had this same model in college and we traded off cutting each others hair. When I graduated I figured I&#x27;d get the same one. This set has everything you need to stay clean cut. I especially enjoy the flip down fine trimmer, although it is not completely necessary. In addition to cutting hair, a razor like this is essential when trimming off a beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the included brush to sweep hair away after each use and I typically oil the blades once every 2-3 uses. It still purrs like a kitten after 6 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically use the #1 and #2 for the sides and a 5-7 on the top. I tried the ear attachments, but it was easier to me to just use a #1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric razors are not all equal. I did have one before this that was awful and had an annoying buzz. This one is a step above those cheap ones and will do the job well for years. I expect this to last decades.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Wahl Clip N Trim here at Amazon and was stunned at how much use we really got out of it.  It has a great assortment of different length guides.  They snap on and off easily.  They feel like &amp;#34;quality&amp;#34;, too.  You are not worried it is the wrong length.  The touch up trimmer that is built on that &amp;#34;flips&amp;#34; to trim things like the back of a neck and sideburns is awesome but can be easily snapped off by mistake.  You always have to watch it and be careful with it.  Mine eventually broke off, but I was still able to use it by keeping a finger on it while I trimmed.  This trimmer finally just wore out and needed replacement but it&#x27;s been almost 10 years. I came back to Amazon and am delighted to see they still sell this one.  I have a cheaper Conair trimmer I picked up in the meantime at a local store because I happened to see it on a  last ditch clearance, but the features of it are not as nice as this one.  What makes this one stand out to me is the flip trimmer.  This Clip N Trim  is a great buy and will last years with proper care.  Mine probably would have lasted longer had I oiled the blade each time, etc.  Don&#x27;t hesitate on this purchase.  We have saved hundreds over the years on haircuts I know.  My husband was paying $20ish a cut years ago and basically I can put the #5 clip on this and give him a cut in minutes that is easy and it looks just as good.  There is no telling how much this has saved us over the years.  He gets a haircut about every 5-6 weeks, so we&#x27;ve saved a lot of money.  If you are trying this for the first time &amp;  not confident in your cutting, YouTube has thousands (if not more) of clips on how to use trimmers and do cuts.  They are worth a quick watch.  You can do it with this little trimmer.</li>
    <li> I am using it for more than a year now. Probably once in 2 month. Every time it performs as first time. I am very poor in maintaining stuffs. but no issues. Clean cut every time. Solid product.</li>
    <li> Mine isn&#x27;t white like the picture but that doesn&#x27;t matter to me. I have had and used it at least once a month for over 2 years now and let me tell you it has definitely paid for itself!</li>
    <li> i forgot when i bought this trimmer. recently it has started making some weird noises when it is on. so i checked again my amazon acct and found out that it has been 4 years now since i got it. i have used it at least twice a month and applied no cleaning whatsoever. so i think it has survived way more than what i would have expected. it is a solid product. if you need a trimmer, just buy it..i will buy a new one now.</li>
    <li> Edit, because 4 years later I am still using this set to cut my boyfriend&#x27;s hair - and my own!</li>
    <li> I have used it to trim my sideburns.  The Clip-and-Trim does an excellent job.  Mechanically sound and functionality is above average...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;reb17</li>
    <li> I started cutting my own hair and this makes it easy.  It comes with may options and has good instructions.</li>
    <li> 5 stars for old model with trimmer</li>
