<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Exactly what I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> The product itself seems decent as it is very thick and I like that as we are using it in lip balm. The shipping speed was terrible. Bought it on Prime and took 9 days to arrive.</li>
    <li> very good quality oil. shipping could have been a little faster because i have prime and it took 4 days to arrive. other than that i am very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time and was exactly as advertised. I am very happy and satisfied with my purchase. I use vitamin E oil in my hair and on my skin (especially face), and this is perfect. I will definitely order it again when I run out.</li>
    <li> It works great for my hair care recipes. I would buy this again. The only downside is mine arrived without a top, it just had it&#x27;s seal, but that was probably a warehouse mistake rather than a product mistake. I thankfully had a little top just sitting around that fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> No fillers, just vitamin E.  This works great to rub on a pregnant belly so your wife does not get stretch marks.  We used about 4 of these bottles during our last pregnancy, and NO STRETCH MARKS!  Get some of this and get to rubbing, your wife will thank you.</li>
    <li> This oil is sticky but that was expected after reading the reviews. I mix this oil with 100% shea butter and use it on my face and upper back where I have a lot of acne scarring. I wouldn&#x27;t say it has worked just yet but hopefully as time goes on. I also use a couple drops of the oil when making my liquid African black soap. Hopefully this combination will work in clearing up my skin!</li>
    <li> Did not know this was not ACTUAL PURE VITAMIN E OIL...pure vitamin e oil is not clear, this oil is strictly for moisturizing and not to aid in the healing of scars!! It even says not to apply to open wounds...SMH they are really false advertising. Giving this away to someone who wants to moisturize...IM TRYING TO HEAL!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years to help my weak, peeling fingernails. I recently had knee replacement surgery and used this on my scar as well.  It really helped keep the scar minimized, soft, and pliable.</li>
    <li> I was told vitamin e helped with healing scared tissue, and boy did it work! Although the scar is still visible, to me, all the hard red welts are gone.  The scar is softer and much less noticeable.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting it to be so thick. I always had to thin it down with another oil.</li>
    <li> I used this stuff through my whole pregnancy and I didn&#x27;t get one stretch mark on my belly! i purchased another bottle just to have. The stuff is super thick, it works! I would put it on my belly at night and massage it in really good for 10 -15 minutes, then put a cotton shirt on so the sheets wouldn&#x27;t sticky. :)</li>
    <li> Very nice product, arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed this oil. I first purchased this at Food Lion. If ppl only knew how good this product is it will not sit on the racks. I started using this on my ingrown toenail. No other oil released me from the constant pain. And I would be pain free for a couple of days before reapplying the oil. I have put it on a couple of acne bumps and my acne cleared up...and yes it is an oil and cleared up my acne. Now this work for me, I had a bad tooth that chip, and became abscessed on the outer gum. I put this oil on top of that tooth and around the gum line, and the abscess went down about 85-90%. I was in between jobs with no dental or health insurance. And this covered me until my benefits became available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very thick, but I dont want to pay for an oil that has been diluted with soybean oil or anything else for that matter. I have to read the ingredient list very carefully because products will say pure vit e and then list other ingredients. My guess is that ppl like the thinner oil because it is easier to spread. But I hope they continue to make this product....I will make my on mixtures if I want, but for now I like this product just the way it is. I believe that this is the synthetic version (laboratory made---because it is clear), same molecular as the natural vitamin e. However this has work wonderfully for me. I am pleased.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! It&#x27;s super thick so sometimes I mix it with my regular body lotion. I use it in bath oil and full-strength on cuts and nicks. Helps them heal while minimizing scarring. A must have for basic skin care!</li>
    <li> Oil is thicker than expected but I really like this product.  I use it on my new surgical scars to help make them not so noticeable.</li>
    <li> i order these frequently great for skin .and burns.</li>
    <li> this product have alot of IU and its a good price to. I order this product to use on a body wrap.</li>
    <li> I am using the Vitamin E Oil 70000 IU to clear the dark spots on my face. I am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not much different than any of the vitamin E oil I&#x27;ve purchase, extra clear or not. The texture is just as thick as any other vitamin E oil. I like how it was sent though in a bubble package, making sure it didn&#x27;t burst during shipment.</li>
    <li> This is the best Vitamin E I have found so far.</li>
    <li> Perfect for chapped lips. I use it for burns, bites any other skin issue that arises. I was unable to find anything this pure in my local walgreens or walmart</li>
    <li> Always a good product</li>
    <li> This is the best Vitamin E oil I have found! Nice and thick and pure!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I put it on my surgery scars.  My order was shipped promptly as promised.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot. I remember when I was younger I used to get the Vitamin E softgels and break them and I would then use the oil to spread over my cheeks and forehead for a much healthier looking skin the morning after</li>
    <li> I use this to make my homemade soaps! I love the stuff! I have used other brands, and this is much better quality!</li>
    <li> This is great stuff healing burn scars was super fast and for the price and purity you cannot ask for more, good stuff, good stuff!!!</li>
    <li> Very sticky... Didnt absorb. Wish i never bought it</li>
    <li> helps with the stretching of my earlobes. I doubt, I would buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;depends on the price.Thank you Christine</li>
    <li> Used this to make home made scrubs and it felt so great and mixed really well with the other ingredients</li>
    <li> I like the consistency of this oil. It&#x27;s not watery, more like a gel but it works well for my homemade body oil and butter mixtures. It does what I expected it to do. It arrived in good time.</li>
    <li> A good value for strong Vitamin E Oil with prompt delivery, saves me from going from store to store, paying more and getting less.</li>
    <li> Use to make E.O. Products</li>
    <li> I bought this vitamin E oil to replace the vitamin E oil I was using from Target because there were other ingredients in the formula I didn&#x27;t care for. I use this Vitamin E oil on my face mainly to help with the dry skin. My skin is fairly sensitive but so far I haven&#x27;t broken out. I will continue to buy and use this product until it gives me a reason not to.</li>
    <li> I am using this as a scar treatment. a facial cream (with b5, and unscented coconut oil) and a cuticle cream (with gloves because it is sticky)&lt;br /&gt;It has helped my face and my nails a lot. I am still waiting to see on the scar.</li>
    <li> Bottle was missing a 1/4 of the oil :(</li>
    <li> good item. hope it does what it is supposed. thick oil</li>
    <li> I have no complaints, I use it in my body butter and pit paste.  It does its job.</li>
    <li> This is very thick. It is not a good or a bad thing. But I am used to Vitamin E oil being oily, but this is thick gel.</li>
    <li> This is a nice concentrated vitamin E oil. Because it is so thick and sticky, I usually mix it with other lotions to give them an extra richness.</li>
    <li> I love this vitamin e oil. Perfect addition to my homemade lotion! Couldn&#x27;t be any happier with this product.</li>
    <li> I got this to put on a wound on my face (bicycle wreck) to prevent scarring. I used it in conjunction with Standard Process USF ointment. A year later, there is no trace of the scar.</li>
    <li> I got the oil in a few days after purchase but I didn&#x27;t realize until afterwards it was 30,000IU instead of 70,000IU as described. Not sure why. Its also not as \\&quot;pure\\&quot; as they make it out to be. When I think pure, I think that its in its natural state with nothing else added. This had a few other oils mixed in &amp; a fragrance. I&#x27;ll keep it &amp; see how it works on my stretch marks anyway.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really thick. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to be certain that it works well, we&#x27;ll see. My disappointment is that the ad makes it appear as though you get 2 bottles...you don&#x27;t only one. That little detail is why I chose this brand over the others.</li>
    <li> This is synthetic and made me break out in a rash.</li>
    <li> I really loved this amazing vitamin ! I apply it at night and when I wake up my face looks so smooth and fresh !&lt;br /&gt;Ordering it when they finish</li>
    <li> Wonderful oil. I use this as an ingredient for my body butter.</li>
    <li> a great size and authentic oil. I can carry it easily in my purse. Great job!</li>
    <li> I have purchased from my local organic store 45000 i.u for over two years now, and so this is my first time trying the Sundown brand, and the 70000... But I must say it&#x27;s over a month now since I&#x27;ve purchased this product and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say as yet, if it is an improvement over the 45... Since results so far is about equal, and because I have used vatamin E for over two years now by just adding a drop to my nightly face creme and to my hair oil products, to help with dry skin and hair/scalp, the result have been marvelous! My skin is great, hair is shining and beautiful and scalp is much improved. So I will reccomend this product from Sundown, the price was awesome.Thanks once again Amazon</li>
    <li> I liked everything about this Vitamin E Oil. First of all it works. The price was good and the delivery was as promised. It came in a cellophane sealed bottle for safety. The top of the clear plastic bottle has a small opening so I can squeeze the exact amount I need and it&#x27;s sanitary. The instructions for use are clear and it has the expiration clearly printed on the label so it has plenty of shelf life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and this vendor. I will totally buy this produce again and buy from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product, although it is very sticky. I am mixing it with vitamin C oil for a facial regime I got from the Dr. Oz show. I will use more vitamin c oil and less vitamin E oil to see if its less sticky. I have been doing this regime for about 4 days, and I have noticed a difference in my skin already. Also using alphahydroxie lotion as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happen to be a stage 4 cancer patient, and this is providing excellent skin care, while I am going through my chemotherapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Zoey</li>
    <li> Use it after every shower.  Feels a bit heavy but it does seem to help and it doesnt stay on top of my skin.  I just give it time before I apply makeup.</li>
    <li> This vitamin E oil was a gift for my grand daughter so it will be a while before I can review the oil, but the shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> This oil is so thick that it will squeeze around the outer edges of the cap. I had to buy a sturdy plastic bottle to avoid the oil mess everywhere!</li>
    <li> Gross sticky gooey, hard to apply.  the consistency is like honey, not oil.  I&#x27;ve had other vit E oil before and they were not gross and gooey like this one.  Can&#x27;t even rub it in bc it&#x27;s so think.</li>
    <li> the bottle of this product, was broken, i have oil, all over my mail, i hope in the future, don&#x27;t happen the same to other costumers, i can return is wast money for me.</li>
    <li> a little thicker than expected I use at night now</li>
    <li> I purchased this to help with severe dry skin and ingrown hairs on my legs, it was part of a routine with a sugar scrub and regular lotion. I love the product. As others said it is very sticky, so be ready to wait for it to absorb in all on its own or cut it with lotion to ease rubbing it in. I will say it was also very helpful in treating my psoriasis, calming the itchiness and lessening redness. It&#x27;s a good price and it will last you awhile.</li>
    <li> Not authentic vitamin E. It should be dark in color this oil is obviously refined and overprocessed negating the effect of the oil. Try Devan vegan E oil capsules it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
    <li> I bought for my stretch marks but really didn&#x27;t see too much of a difference sadly :(</li>
    <li> I need more. It really gets rid of wrinkles &amp; soften your skin</li>
    <li> Irritates my skin.  I doubt that happens to everyone, as I have pretty sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is the synthetic version</li>
    <li> Having purchased many brands of Vitamin E oil, I was surprised that this one at 70,000 IU was so thick.  It is great on my surgery wound.  It is great as a mixer with unprocessed shea butter.  I use it at night after cleansing around my eyes and mouth.  I even use it to \\&quot;beef up\\&quot; other oils with less IU&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I already have this and use it while I&#x27;m pregnant to (hopefully) prevent stretch marks.  It worked well with my first pregnancy and I&#x27;m using it again.  It&#x27;s very concentrated and a great consistency compared to most of the others.  It&#x27;s not runny and it&#x27;s not too thick either.  Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing. First off it helped clear up my unwanted acne. It&#x27;s a honey like texture so you have to get used to it. I usually put it on before bed then in the morning and gently remove the honey like layer before makeup. On sunny days this is all I wear no makeup!</li>
    <li> Great price, for a great item!</li>
    <li> Product consistency much thicker than expected. Hard to rub in on skin. Also it is the synthetic version of vitamin e for those of u looking for all natural products like myself.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my fiancé to put on his scars. We&#x27;re only on day three of use. The oil is thick so you don&#x27;t need to use a lot. Doesn&#x27;t have an odor either.</li>
    <li> Made my skin feel softer and wrinkles were less noticeable.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help heal a deep scar from recent surgery. It&#x27;s thicker than most oil and makes it difficult to rub into still-tender skin. However, as time goes on and the skin becomes less sensitive, I plan to use it more.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied w/ product. Recommending it to others.</li>
    <li> Been using this on My eyelashes at night and they are getting longer and fluffier with in a week ❤️❤️</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  It looks like it&#x27;s pure vitamin E.  It&#x27;s a bit more expensive than other products that are only part vitamin E oil, and part soybean or some other cheaper oil.  But, you get what you pay for, in this case, and no annoying fragrances have been added!</li>
    <li> I became obsessed with vitamin e oil about 2 years ago. I would pat it into my skin every night before bed, and all my scars vanished and my skin has never been in better shape. This oil is as good as any. I love using their little dropper at the top, which allows the oil to come out in a more controlled way when you squeeze the bottle. To those who are complaining that it&#x27;s \\&quot;too thick\\&quot;... you have obviously never used high-IU vitamin e before. The higher the IU, the thicker it is. Yes, it&#x27;s kind of like honey (as one reviewer said,) so you just pat it into the skin. I much rather prefer this consistency. It makes the oil stay where I put it and feels more moisturizing. I love it!!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent oil. use a small amount of it at night. when I again run out will purchase another bottle of it. Thank you for your time, have a good evening</li>
    <li> Great product! I am using it on a 6&amp;#34; surgical scar and it is disappearing wonderfully ! I also used this when I was pregnant (32 years ago). I rubbed it on my body once a day and walked away with 4 stretch marks that are so tiny, you have to strain to see them!</li>
    <li> Pure vitamin E oil is exactly what I wanted. I use it in a lot of me homemade beauty recipes ( lotion, lip balm, deodorant etc.) as a natural preservative. It is also great for healing scars!</li>
    <li> This is a very good quality oil.  We use it in body scrub recipes and it performs very well. Good product at a fair price.</li>
    <li> i use this oil daily on my knee surgery scar which has practically faded after 2 months.i highly recommend this oil</li>
    <li> Super thick.  I put it on at night to help with loose skin and stretch marks post baby.  I wrap myself with plastic wrap and band over night.  It&#x27;s still there in the morning and well into middle of the day.</li>
    <li> I have always taken the capsules, but thought I&#x27;d try the oil. I have not used it yet, though. Hope to soon.</li>
    <li> Does not appear to have eliminated the flaking.&lt;br /&gt;Will give it some more time.&lt;br /&gt;Some improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Will follow up later!</li>
    <li> This is a very solid product.  I am mixing it with icy hot and applying it to a torn hamstring, so it can absorb into the affected area..  Very good product, Arrived when it was supposed to arrive, and the price is very fair.</li>
    <li> I am still trying to get the most use out of this product.  The sticky texture takes getting use to, but I believe my skin is glowing as a result of the product....too early to tell for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RL in Stone Mountain</li>
    <li> I received my order promptly and in good condition. I hope the oil will work well with the derma roller and the ultrasonic skin device to improve the apparence of my skin. It&#x27;s too soon to tell yet.</li>
    <li> I love this product for my pregnancy belly. I use it in the mornings after a shower &amp; follow with lotion to help with the sticky feeling. No stretch marks (yet at least)!</li>
    <li> Last year I had melanoma skin cancer that spread up into my lymph nodes and had two surgeries to get it removed including a skin graft. I place this on my incision scars and grafted skin and it has made a tremendous difference in how fast the scars are healing and they are much less angry and red. I stopped using for a brief period and I could really notice a difference. I started back up and the scars continue to look a little better every day.</li>
    <li> After reading a pinterest pin on elongating and darkening eyelashes and eyebrows, I decided to try it myself. I bought this particular vitamin E oil and Tropic Isle Living Jamaican Black Castor Oil, as the pin also required castor oil. I&#x27;ve never purchased either but figured they had pretty good reviews. After mixing them up in correct quantaties, I began to apply the oils and sure enough within 2 weeks of use my eyelashes were so full I didn&#x27;t even need mascara. I&#x27;ve read it has many other uses but I&#x27;ve only experimented with the one above.</li>
    <li> I do clamp done on my teeth when-ever I&#x27;m stressed out. This Vitamin E is one of the best I&#x27;ve run across. Since it&#x27;s 70000 IU&#x27;s it&#x27;s think and will stay on the spot I need it the most. It helps prevent a canker sore from coming full bore. I can get 50000 IU bottles locally, but this is a better deal from the cost to the thickness of it. It&#x27;s easy to use and stays where I want it. No more canker ssores!!!</li>
    <li> Bought it to apply to my incision from a recent surgery.  A little thicker than I expected.</li>
    <li> The consistency is really thick – think &amp;#34;breakfast syrup&amp;#34;. But I really notice a difference in the smoothness and suppleness of my skin the next day when I put it on. I use it as a night cream.</li>
    <li> I use this around my eyes at night. Works great</li>
    <li> I bought this originally to use in making homemade bath fizzies.  Now I use it as a chapstick and lotion for my hands.  This winter really caused my skin to be dryer than usual, so this vitamin E oil basically cured my dry skin.  Works better than any chapstick as well.  Just know, a little goes a long way and it will be sticky right after application, but it absorbs relatively quickly causing the stickyness to disappear.</li>
    <li> I bought this in a store because I was low in supply at home. Much to my dismay when I went to apply it the substance was not an oil at all but a gel that was very sticky and impossible to spread on my face. I don&#x27;t know if the bottle I purchased was bad, old, etc. but I was extremely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I will not be purchasing that item nor any item made by Sundown asI do not trust them.</li>
    <li> My Neighbor, who is a specialty surgeon, recommended using vitamin e oil for treating&amp; healing wounds.&lt;br /&gt;I had suffering a 14 inch wound to my left arm. i had pinched this area resulting a significant splitting and bruising to area.&lt;br /&gt;When the wound starting closing. i started working the oil into my entire arm several times a day.&lt;br /&gt;The area healed in 6 or so weeks. I now use this product as my primary produce for all areas of my skin. a great product to prevent&lt;br /&gt;dry and irritated areas..</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my serious dry skin. My skin gets so dry that it cracks - and using lotion just burns. This is comforting and seems to take care of my dry skin without leaving an oily mess - which sounds odd, I know. I mean it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily film like Vaseline. It hydrates dry skin well and lasts a lot longer than any lotion I&#x27;ve tried. I also like using it around my eyes. I don&#x27;t know if the oil helps with the wrinkles yet, but it leaves my skin feeling really soft and good. My daughter really wanted it to use on her chapped lips. She&#x27;s happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find an interesting article on Huffington Post (&amp;#34;Vitamin E Oil: Why You Should Use On Your Body With Caution&amp;#34; from 6.21.13) about some of the issues of using vitamin e.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: This stuff is &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;. I wouldn&#x27;t run out and buy it, but it&#x27;s nice to have. Especially if you suffer from severe dry skin, cuticles,  or lips.</li>
    <li> Works wonders on skin.&lt;br /&gt;Heals acne scars, cuts, razor bumps.. You can apply it anywhere  Super sticky and highly effective. Just great!</li>
    <li> its good but to thick , I will l get a lower iu next  time. other thna that its great for scars ..</li>
    <li> Used this after my hip replacement surgery to massage the scar tissue.  Great for reducing the scar tissue and healing in general.</li>
    <li> I have used it for over a week now and I am impressed with it&#x27;s healing qualities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Macca</li>
    <li> Vitamin E Oil has hundreds of important uses:  wonderful emollient for skin, especially face, around eyes and lips.  That&#x27;s my favorite use.  It is far superior in lubricating the skin than any cream or other oil I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> very soothing, I put it on at night but not every night. Fast results after using, the following morning face is so refreshed</li>
    <li> I love it it is amazing</li>
    <li> I usually use Spring Valley Vitamin E oil 10000 IU and it works great on reducing scars resulting from cuts and scrapes, so I thought that this would be even better.  It&#x27;s thick, but it does not work near as well as the Spring Valley.  In fact, I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement with this brand. However, it does make your skin feel nice.</li>
    <li> i like it from first used and i will wait to see the result. i liked because its thick and i can mix it with any creme</li>
    <li> This is the worst vitamin E oil I&#x27;ve ever bought. It didn&#x27;t do any good to my skin. I even think it made my skin problems kinda worse.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality vitamin E oil and you get quite a bit of it and very well priced.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Really high quality, but very thick. I add apricot oil to smooth over my face.</li>
    <li> Am fiving the oil itself 5 stars... But the delivery part was a royal nightmare it took about 14 days past the promised delivery time to get this oil..But in all its was worth the wait because it help clear up my face as I expected it to ...</li>
    <li> A great E Oil and fast delivery</li>
    <li> I bought the Vitamin E Oil for an at home body wrap. After looking at several different makers this was the one I went with and I was NOT disappointed. The oil isn&#x27;t as clear as the picture but it&#x27;s pretty darn close. So far I&#x27;ve used it on it&#x27;s own and combined with a lotion and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. Great makers, perfect packaging and the individual bottles were wrapped in tamper proof plastic. Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> Really good for your skin, this one is thick and sticky, but helped my skin. You can added to you face cream.</li>
    <li> great deal, I love this oil for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> I got this oil to put on my surgical scars.  I have been massaging the oil into my scars nightly.  I haven&#x27;t really noticed much difference.  The oil itself is very pure and thick, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it to massage on large areas because of its thickness.  Overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> The price is so good, I was questioning the quality of this oil, so I did some research.  I found out that Natural vitamin e -- sourced naturally-- is actually a darker amber color.  This &#x27;so pure its clear&#x27; stuff plays on the typical assumption that natural stuff is \\&quot;cleaner looking\\&quot;, sparkly, white or clear.  In fact, on synthetic vitamin e is clear or pale yellow, the really nourishing stuff is actually darker.  This makes a big difference for me because NATURAL vitamin e works wonders on my psoriasis... I get this scabby itchy psoriasis patch around my eyes so its crucial that I treat it regularly with vitamin e to keep it from causing me vision problems.  I learned the difference between D-alpha tocopheryl (NATURAL Vitamin e) and DL-alpha tocopheryl (SYNTHETIC)  [the little &#x27;L&#x27; is the only clue that its synthetic) because I mistaken bought the synthetic stuff, applied it to my eye area, and my eyes swoll up HUGE and the psoriasis dramatically worsened-- I latter figured out that the synthetic stuff was actually aggrevating my condition, possibly an allergic reaction.      Most of these vitamin e oils on Amazon fail to give a full ingredients list or specify which TYPE of vitamin e oil they include, which can make all the difference if you have sensitive skin.  I encourage everyone to check the items ingredients on their own company website and look for D-ALPHA and little other oils mixed in.      Yes, D-ALPHA, is dramaticaly more expensive, but in my experience if you have sensitive skin, are applying it to a delicate area, or have a mark you really need to heal, I say go for the best stuff.  Think of it as medicine, because natural vitamen e works better for treating skin problems and healing scars than a lot of pharmaceutical products out there.</li>
    <li> I figured that this oil is not going to be totally natural---I don&#x27;t think in nature you find natural sources of Vitamin E that are this potent.  But I planned to use it as more of a preservative---along with the Vitamin E benefits---in an oil blend for skin application.  Vitamin E oil works to stabilize other oils that are more perishable, and many natural oils for the skin do not have a long shelf life.  So I purposely wanted to find an oil that was very concentrated to help my oils last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to have done the trick, because some oils I use have a short shelf life, but it seems this stuff extended my oils&#x27; period of use.  I wouldn&#x27;t try using this stuff alone, though, it&#x27;s very viscous and sticky, but for my plans it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> This product is Very sticky, not easy to use,spread</li>
    <li> Amazing for scar reduction</li>
    <li> I bought some Trader Joes and didn&#x27;t use it because of the soy oil added. This product is pure - I&#x27;m very happy about that. Sundown is a great brand and I am definitely going to buy more. Beware of what is added to other brands.</li>
    <li> Great for my post - op scar!</li>
    <li> Good product and very well packed</li>
    <li> Used this for a great many things, from minor cuts, burns, sun spots, to using in essential oil salves, great!</li>
    <li> Wfes purchase! I heard no complaints!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing, you can se results from this in one night. It&#x27;s a little thicker than I expected, so I mix the oil with lotion and apply over my body. I am using this to restore a youthful appearance and quality of skin.</li>
    <li> Timely and exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> I use it in making or adding to face cream.</li>
    <li> Great oil for your skin.If you don&#x27;t have to go anywhere,just wear it as a mask all day.It does remail sticky on a skin &amp; you&#x27;d need to wash it off if you need to remove it.But it quickly improves a skin tone.Worked great on my fresh scar (with stitches),in 2 weeks of constant use (at least a few hours every day),my scar has completely healed and skin became smooth.It was almost unnoticeable that there was an injury.After 2-3 more weeks the skin tone just became normal,no purple/red skin discoloration.It does miracles.</li>
    <li> This is NOT a natural oil. it is taocopheryl acetate. acetate can have serious side effects.</li>
    <li> Vitamin E oil comes out of container very easily and efficiently. Best price I can ever remember seeing for pure vitamin E. Back to basics skin moisturizer that most likely should be a basic component of a health care program.</li>
    <li> Basically, I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 days (Before bed), and it&#x27;s really wonderful. I&#x27;ve been using it for acne scars on my face, and they&#x27;ve already significantly faded. Basically, everyones skin/healing process etc is different, and a lot of this goes a long way. Instead of sitting reading reviews, just at least try this, and see if it works for you.</li>
    <li> This Vitamin E oil is so luscious and thick! Just what I was looking for at a fair price.</li>
    <li> I did not know what the number of IU meant. I thought a higher number would be a better product. However, this oil is so thick I cannot use it at all. I thought it would be good for use on skin and toenails, but it is thick, gooey and sticky. I can&#x27;t even give it away because no one else I know has any use for it either.&lt;br /&gt;A brief explanation about IU concentration with the product description would have been helpful.</li>
    <li> love this oil.  i use it for everything and its pure vitamin e.  the only ingredient is tocopheryl acetate (vitamin e).</li>
    <li> Excellent. Thick and does the job of healing scars and skin. Great for under eye smoothing of lines and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I use this as a preservative in my home made lotions and soaps! Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> THIS IS NOT PURE VITAMIN E.  It contains tocopheryl acetate irritating to skin, causing redness, rashes, and potential allergic reactions. According to the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) of the ingredient, tocopheryl acetate helped protect against oxidative damage, but produced skin sensitizing or skin irritating effects in one animal study. A 1991 study detailed four cases of contact dermatitis caused by cosmetic creams that contained tocopheryl acetate.&lt;br /&gt;The CIR, though it concluded that tocopheryl was safe for cosmetics, also noted that studies with the ingredient demonstrated some “enhancement of photocarcinogenesis,” which means it may actually encourage the carcinogenic effects of UV rays.&lt;br /&gt;High doses of this ingredient have also been found in animal studies to cause tumor formation. Though that’s not likely to be a concern if you’re using only a little of the ingredient, as in most personal care products, the concern is the potential buildup over time. We simply don’t have the necessary safety studies on this ingredient when used for several times a day over many years.</li>
    <li> Waste of money, find else where.</li>
    <li> love it! it has helped with skin discoloration under my armpits.</li>
    <li> I rub this into my eczema daily, and the condition is nearly gone!  Have had great results using it on sunburn as well, and rubbed into cuts and incisions it will help heal scars.  It is sticky, but not unpleasant.</li>
    <li> Do see any effect after using that product for a while. Don&#x27;t even know why  I bought it at the first place.</li>
    <li> Cannot buy this in the stores anywhere and found it here.  Great.  This is good for scars after surgery. Hightly recommend this site to get your Vitamin E Oil.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Other oils labelled Vitamin E oil had 4 other oils in them with some E oil. This product is ALL Vitamin E. Very effective for healing and top quality.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and exactly as expected.</li>
    <li> Excellent for your face and to mix with your body cream. it is not to tick.</li>
    <li> Good quality excellent price.</li>
    <li> I had unsightly scars all over my legs (from knees down) due to past years of obsessive compulsive picking, and this oil faded the marks and cleared up my legs within about a year of consistent nightly application, which is pretty impressive if you ask me. As a bonus, it makes a superb overnight lip treatment. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I started using this oil at the suggestion of a friend. I am a huge believer in having a skin care regimen and sticking to it. I am 38 years old and I still get compliments on how my youngest sister (9 yrs younger than me) and I look like twins! I started noticing fine lines around my eyes and started to panic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She advised that I use this oil only around my eyes, forehead and mouth (where fine lines tend to occur) - I&#x27;ve been doing this every night for a month and notice a difference in the overall feel of my face: it&#x27;s more supple and it even glows! At this price I will continue using and one bottle will most definitely last for years! You only need one dab - I anticipate not needing a new bottle for at least 4 years. Be sure to check expiration date though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most definitely will recommend this product to anyone seeking the fountain of youth!</li>
    <li> I was looking for some vitamin E oil to use in making my own natural lotions.  The price was good, and I wasn&#x27;t able to find an oil with more IUs anywhere!</li>
    <li> So thick, can&#x27;t use it alone</li>
    <li> I bought this locally after my Dr. said to use Vitamin E on my surgery scar. I did not realize that when Sundown says \\&quot;Natural Vitamin E Oil\\&quot; they mean \\&quot;Synthetic Vitamin E oil\\&quot;. I Called Sundown (1-888-848-2435) after getting home and reading the bottle carefully and under Warnings it says: \\&quot;Do not apply to broken, irritated skin or areas affected by rashes\\&quot;. I thought that was strange thing to say about vitamin E oil so I called them. After talking with one of their customer service reps I found out that this is a synthetic Vitamin E oil and It is not meant to be put on any type of wounds or rashes or other things you would think it should be used for. It is made just to moisturize your skin. I can think of a hundred better things to moisturize your skin with than synthetic oil. I&#x27;m not sure why they make this but I know that many people are buying it thinking it&#x27;s Natural. The company is using false advertising and hopefully they will stop before someone gets hurt by an infection or something.</li>
    <li> Love! Mixing this with coconut oil for my stretch marks after the birth of my daughter. Gentle and no scent.</li>
    <li> My wife is very happy with the oil and is planning to order  6 more bottles for friends and family</li>
    <li> great product.  delivered as expected. thanks.</li>
    <li> this is what I expected to get and I really like the product very much.  I use it daily.. its great</li>
    <li> Thinking that more IU&#x27;s are better, I ordered this for some scarring on my face.  The oil (and I&#x27;m using the term loosely) is so thick that I pull the skin on my face whenI try to apply it.  I am going to try to mix it with some other oil to thin it a bit, but just beware-- this stuff is really thick!</li>
    <li> Used this to smooth out some scars from a recent surgery. Works well.</li>
    <li> feels good, but I think I shouldn use it every day. Pimples appears</li>
    <li> Great oil very pure and good price.</li>
    <li> Great for painful cuticle cracks. Just put on at night with a band-aid &amp; better in AM</li>
    <li> Use this with my essential oils.  It is awesome. I even at times use it at night for my face before bed.  Great price</li>
    <li> its synthetheic but acts great.&lt;br /&gt;its priced right and great for skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;reduces wrinkes and can be used as a itch remedy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it improves complexion and is a great moisturizer</li>
    <li> Great stuff,arrive on time. I love it</li>
    <li> Clearly this bottle leaks. They shrink wrapped it twice and it was a huge mess. About a third of the bottle leaked out.</li>
    <li> I use this product every night to remove the mascara. LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> When this arrived, the inside of the padded envelope and outside of the bottle was covered with a sticky goo. I thought maybe the lid was not on tightly. Once or twice I added a few drops of this to some baby oil to apply after showers in the dry desert air where I live. It was difficult to get it into the bottle. This product made little balls or bubbles in the baby oil so I had to shake the baby oil well to disperse the vitamin E before applying. I let the bottle of Vitamin E untouched in a cabinet for about 6 months after that and one day found a  sticky gooey mess running down the wall below the cabinet and onto the floor. This product was laying on its side and had soften, dissolved the plastic lid enough so that it had almost entirely leaked out. Had to use many many paper towels and a lot of alcohol on them to remove this from all the surfaces it had covered. Now coming here to leave a review, I read a review that the product is synthetic, not natural. Not sure what you would use this for other than to dissolve some plastics. Buy the more expensive, truly natural vitamin E products on amazon.com instead of this one.</li>
    <li> i was so glad when I finally got this since vouching to use more natural products ive noticed the change from using non natural products, i recently had surgery on my ankle and the vitamin just healed the skin from were my ankle was fixed its barely noticebale however i still will need to use shea oil to fade the dark spots on my skin</li>
    <li> Beware of false advertising! This is NOT natural vitamin E oil, it&#x27;s synthetic. Don&#x27;t get it anywhere near a cut, a rash, your eyes, etc. Essentially this oil is worthless. It does moisturize my skin, but so do plenty of other safer products.</li>
    <li> I have been adding this vitamin E oil to a mix of oils that I apply to my body after the shower.  The proven benefits of blocking free radical damage and  boosting collagen production prompted me to add Vitamin E oil to my body oil mixture.  I have also been applying this oil to a scar on my knee.  After just a short time, I feel that the scar is less noticeable.  This is a very thick oil, but adding it in with other oils makes it sink in to the skin much easier.  I am</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because it had good reviews and seemed to be the best value for this amount on Amazon. I have NO issues with the product - it is a great, pure oil and has worked miracles for my skin. Unfortunately, the bottle is seriously defected. It leaks EVERYWHERE. Right now I&#x27;m toting it around in a plastic bag, which isn&#x27;t ideal. Maybe I can put the oil in a new bottle...pretty inconvenient.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for hair ends, but not to be used on scalp--I loved it and used it to seal  and condition ends.</li>
    <li> It was sticky like honey instead of oily.  I called company and they set me a coupon.</li>
    <li> just Vit E, exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> I Iove this product for taking my makeup off.  It works very well and does not get in my eyes.  Good seller and competitive pricing.</li>
    <li> I use this a preservative in a homemade product I am making as Christmas gifts.</li>
    <li> i take this for my skin. my doc wanted me to take a pure liquid form. since its fat soluable you really want to measure the dosage so you don&#x27;t waste any of it. because its a good deal on amazon but still a little pricey.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews, but this was so terrible I feel I should warn others. I&#x27;m not 100% sure this isn&#x27;t natural (as some reviewers have written) but I can&#x27;t believe something natural would cause such skin distress in a short amount of time. I bought this to lighten scars on my legs from mosquito bites and, since I had read good reviews about Vitamin E, I also put a thin layer on my face. Within minutes, my legs started to develop a rash. At first, I thought I had more mosquito bites but, on closer look, there weren&#x27;t any bites, just bumpy rashes. Then literally within 1 minute of applying to my face, I started feeling very itchy all over my face and my face felt swollen. Deciding to quickly wash off with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap, I felt little bumpy rashes all over my entire face. I&#x27;ve never felt such stinging from washing my face. I had to wash twice to get rid of all the stickiness and it hurt. Now ten minutes later, and after applying an all-natural moisturizer, my face is somewhat better. I still have a pretty uncomfortable stinging sensation but I&#x27;m relieved at least the bumps are gone. I&#x27;m not sure why this has gotten good reviews.</li>
    <li> So rich and thick,  bit sticky but it&#x27;s serious stuff. No pregnancy stretch marks on me! But be prepared as with all this stuff your pajamas will get a greasy mark but it&#x27;s your belly forever ladies!</li>
    <li> This stuff is really thick like maple syrup and doesn&#x27;t absorb well .it leaves your skin feeling greasy .I would apply it at night and by the morning my face would still feel greasy .you get better results from raw olives just squeeze the olives and apply the juice to your skin and see results in minutes .This product is trash!</li>
    <li> I use Vitamin E oil in the winter time. my skin can get very dry during this season - it serves as a great moisturizer. Natural products are better than any over the counter department store products.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time finding E without other additives.  I like the quality and the price, so will buy again.</li>
    <li> Seems like an excellent value.  I use this as a preservative for DIY skin care products and am pleased with the quality and price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this product for my scar, and I love the results I&#x27;m getting on skin. In just  two months, my scar is fading away.</li>
    <li> Thisis a great product or  dry skin i usually use it in my feet and fee; good , gra grea great</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  Living in a very dry climate and working with horses, skin needs all the help it can get.  This oil does exactly what I needed and I love it!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. However, the picture shows two bottles of oil. You are buying only one bottle. Price is reasonable. This the highest concentration found.</li>
    <li> Like the high potency</li>
    <li> Great product and cheaper than purchasing in the stores. Lots of great benefits.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help with putting in a different guage nose ring and this is easier to use them the capsules. So it worked for what I needed it for.</li>
    <li> do not buy this. amazon stop selling!!! read this info....it is from a reliable source on line. Sundown vit e is tocopheryl acetate.    What is Tocopheryl Acetate?    This ingredient is basically a form of vitamin E created in the laboratory. Manufacturers take natural vitamin E and add acetic acid to it.    Acetic acid is the main component of vinegar. The word \\&quot;acid\\&quot; means just what you&#x27;d think--it&#x27;s corrosive, and attacks the skin. A simple carboxylic acid, it&#x27;s used in the production of chemicals for photographic film, wood glue, and synthetic fibers and fabrics. Why would manufacturers mix perfectly good vitamin E with this irritating ingredient.    Two words: cheaper, and longer lasting. Adding the acid to vitamin E makes it last longer on the shelves. That makes it easier for manufacturers to process, ship, store, and sell their products.    What are the Concerns?    The concerns with this ingredient are first, that it can be potentially irritating to skin, causing redness, rashes, and potential allergic reactions. According to the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) of the ingredient, tocopheryl acetate helped protect against oxidative damage, but produced skin sensitizing or skin irritating effects in one animal study. A 1991 study detailed four cases of contact dermatitis caused by cosmetic creams that contained tocopheryl acetate.    The CIR, though it concluded that tocopheryl was safe for cosmetics, also noted that studies with the ingredient demonstrated some \\&quot;enhancement of photocarcinogenesis,\\&quot; which means it may actually encourage the carcinogenic effects of UV rays.    High doses of this ingredient have also been found in animal studies to cause tumor formation. Though that&#x27;s not likely to be a concern if you&#x27;re using only a little of the ingredient, as in most personal care products, the concern is the potential buildup over time. We simply don&#x27;t have the necessary safety studies on this ingredient when used for several times a day over many years.Another issue comes from the Environmental Working Group (EWG), which notes concerns regarding contamination with hydroquinone, a whitening compound. During the manufacturing process, tocopheryl acetate may be contaminated with hydroquinone, which can also cause dermatitis, increase sensitivity to UV rays, and may have potentially carcinogenic properties.    Why Take the Risk?    Of all the potentially harmful ingredients, this is probably one of the milder ones. It is vitamin E, which can have some benefits. The thing is, why not just stick with vitamin E? Why take the risks with tocopheryl acetate when you don&#x27;t have to?    All Annmarie Gianni products that have vitamin E have the pure kind. No acids added! I say, get the full benefit of the real stuff that hasn&#x27;t been tampered with in the laboratory. Your skin will thank you!</li>
    <li> great product for homemade beauty products</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. I&#x27;ve used this product before and just as happy now as I was then. Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Great for making eye cream and night cream.  Vitamin E oil is all around good for skin care.</li>
    <li> Hi! Good oil for scars.</li>
    <li> Very potent.  Good for the skin.</li>
    <li> I buy this for myself and all my (grown) children. It is great to have on hand. We use it for any worrisome blemishes that appear on our skin (you know what I mean) and they always disappear.</li>
    <li> It seems to be what it says it is.</li>
    <li> I bought this to go into my coconut oil...which I mix up and use as a night cream.....This oil is thick and really feels great on my skin by itself.  In the coconut oil, it made it creamy and gave it a sheen....love this product.</li>
    <li> Great addition for my homemade lotions.</li>
    <li> This liquid vitamin E oil is great on the hands and elbows to prevent the dry winter cracking.  Also, use this at bedtime with socks on the feet.  It just feels so good.</li>
    <li> didnt realized how yucky sticky this is</li>
    <li> This is perfect for eyelash growth. I put it on my finger and blink it on and then sleep with it on. I love it,</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this item in the mail and it is a sticky mess. The bottle leaked in the envelop it was mailed, about 1/4 of it was gone and made the receipt and the envelop all wet and sticky.</li>
    <li> Love it, used it on a surgical scar.</li>
    <li> I love this. I use it in recipes to make my own hand soap, bath wash, and skin care needs.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Removed 1 star because to use on my skin I need to mix it with another oil or cream otherwise it is a bit gummy/sticky. I will buy again though.</li>
    <li> I looked all over the state of Delaware and could not find this vitamin E anywhere. I&#x27;m not a person who shops online but, when I saw you guys had just what I was looking for I just had to order it. This product works great on my dry skin and the price was awesome. Got a great deal!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> The picture is a little misleading about the color but overall I was happy with the product. It was thicker than some of the oils I&#x27;ve used but it still worked fine.</li>
    <li> It is a gel not a oil- very sticky when applied to skin.  Do not buy this product- not worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is definitely Worth every last cent. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good deal. Get it!</li>
    <li> The product is very helpful to me.  A little dab will do you!  It is helping my dry skin and my husband&#x27;s also.</li>
    <li> I have looked in town for pure vitamin oil with no luck,  found this online and it received it a few days letter and just love it...good product</li>
    <li> I do like the benefits of vitamin e oil. However, the only drawback that I found with using this one is that it was way too thick. I recommend diluting with some other thin oil. Perhaps coconut, olive or jojoba oil. Any thin oil of your choice. Great benefits of Vitamin E. Both hair and skin, just have to dilute.</li>
    <li> This is REALLY thick so you might have to dilute it... so thick that it was hard to put on and I felt like I had petroleum jelly on my face all night with my hair sticking to it every other minute. So gross, as if you put lip gloss on your face.  I bought a much lower IU dosage of 10,000 and used it to dilute this one.  5 stars for it being great and as advertised, my fault for not reading the description.</li>
    <li> very concentrated, I would recommend the 50 000U</li>
    <li> Product caused a severe rash.</li>
    <li> Will be using this to make my own face lotion and eye creams, looking forward to see how it works.</li>
    <li> Arrived in pristine condition and it works as expected.  Use it on my eczema and in home made bath bombs.</li>
    <li> I learned after ordering that the there was no such thing as 70000 Vitamin E.  I could have saved my time and money.</li>
    <li> I have always been interested in the properties of Vitamin E.  I finally decided to start using it in balms and other things.</li>
    <li> Vit E oil is very important in skin care.  This being clear makes it a great addition to any homemade skincare products like lotion bars etc.  as it won&#x27;t discolor what your are making.  I do not usually worry about it because I use the natural colors of what I add to stuff anyway.  But if that is a concern you don&#x27;t have to worry about this stuff here.</li>
    <li> I like this because it is pure. I use it on my hair and skin. I mix it with other oils. You only need a small amount.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I use it as a lip moisturizer and I mix it with other oils for my hair.</li>
    <li> Bought at local grocery store because they had vitamin prs oducts 1/2 off and had sent me a coupon for two dollars off this brand.  Tried this \\&quot;oil\\&quot; and the consistency is much thicker than I expected.  I use jojoba oil and it is thicker but not like this.  Sundown Naturals vitamin E oil is super viscous and when applied to the skin it feels very sticky and a little gritty.  My hands were very dry I tried it on them and it never soaked in.  It was sticky like glycerin but even when I went to wash it off with soap, it left a filmy residue on my skin.  Really didn&#x27;t like this.  Might be okay mixed into another product for homemade lotion or something but I was afraid any lotion I make with this would end up with the same nasty sticky feeling.  I&#x27;m going to see if the grocery store will take it back, even though it was cheap.  Gonna take other reviewers&#x27; advice and try a natural d-alpha vitamin E oil. Now Foods makes one that I found here on Amazon and the price isn&#x27;t bad and I have been happy with all the Now Foods products I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
    <li> I bought it yesterday from a local merchant...same exact product, and it&#x27;s useless: thick and waxy. I wanted it for my fingernails and I can not rub it in...hours later, it&#x27;s just lying on top of them like gum. Real vit E will absorb.</li>
    <li> They should have 0 star option as well. Because some prodicts dont even deserve one start. This product is not not effective at all. Applied on my Son&#x27;s 3 weeks old scar and it started making it harder. Seller has no return policy and asked me to contact the manufacturer. I dont recomend to buy this product all at. The seller simply cannot stand behind the product they are selling.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. so good for cuticles!</li>
    <li> I gave it to my friend to test it in his lab , he said it&#x27;s not pure quality .</li>
    <li> Good product and container.</li>
    <li> Intended to buy for my stretch mark and works little by little..</li>
    <li> I am applying this to my thyroid removal scar. It works well. Its a bit oily, but it n does.its job.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  Smooths lines around eyes and mouth.  I will continue using it cause it works very well.</li>
    <li> will buy again and again and again. love this stuff.</li>
    <li> good value price lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> Did not purchase through Amazon, found it at a local health food store:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this as my lip balm, it works better than anything - my lips are visibly more plump just because they are thoroughly moisturized. I also put it around my eyes at night.  I wake up &amp; my eyes look refreshed!</li>
    <li> This oil is not a pure/natural form of vitamin E.  It is synthetic, and actually gave me a rash.  I bought it to use after minor surgery to help with scarring, and it did nothing but aggravate my skin. I have since purchased a natural form of vitamin e oil, and after just one night my skin cleared and my scar looks alot less red and aggravated.&lt;br /&gt;Do some research and make sure you buy a natural oil, and it will help you heal alot faster : )</li>
    <li> Used daily along with cocoa butter and mothers oil to prevent stretch marks. Oil is thick and can be sticky but nixes well with Mothers Blend before application. Highly recommend to prevent stretch marks during pregnancy.</li>
    <li> Great price better then the prices in stores cannot believe the purety.this is the real Deal ,packaged well tight and plastic.ships to your home in a protectid package love it.</li>
    <li> It leaves your hair soft and shiny, and does not feel greasy. Great for your skin too. Great product. I recommended</li>
    <li> I will not ever buy this again.  It is so sticky that it is hard to put on and it does not absorb into my skin for hours!  I wrote to the company that sells this and they said &amp;#34;they have not heard of any problems with this product so maybe I should contact the manufacturer&amp;#34;.  I did email the manufacturer and almost a week went by before I received any response.  They want to &amp;#34;talk to me&amp;#34; about this but frankly I don&#x27;t care any more as I won&#x27;t be buying it again or using it again.  This is NOT like any oil I have ever used before.....it&#x27;s like spreading honey all over you but actually the honey would probably go on smoother than this does.  Definitely will not recommend this product!</li>
    <li> His grandfather and his grandfather conduction velocity they are great&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very amazing to me with all your dealings with the speed and ease</li>
    <li> love this oil.  its pure vitamin e.  the only ingredient is tocopheryl acetate (vitamin e).  excellentto add in skin and hair products</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t need to use a lot to get full coverage. I use Vitamin E for a lot of things. This is so concentrated, a tiny drop on my finger can moisturize my entire face! Yes, it&#x27;s greasy, but that&#x27;s to be expected. Pair this with zinc &amp; coconut oil &amp; you&#x27;ve got the world&#x27;s best sunscreen. I have fair skin &amp; in live in Florida. People get my age wrong all the time. I&#x27;m 30, but people always mistaken me for 22-23.</li>
    <li> Thin but quality oil, clear and scentless. I put it on my acne scars and saw DRASTIC reduction, even in winter when my skin is pale in winter. It also provides overall moisture to dry skin. Buy it!</li>
    <li> This really helps with the stretch marks that come from body building and I highly recommend this product.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> A household staple, indeed!</li>
    <li> I just received this tonight and immediately used it on my arms, neck and face, where I have been suffering from a particularly dry and itchy rash. It soothed and moisturized better than any other oil or lotion I have tried. I will certainly be buying this product again! I especially appreciate the purity of this product and the price is also very affordable. I look forward to using it in other ways in the future.</li>
    <li> works. came well packaged</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on my face along with Frownie&#x27;s Immune Perfect as a daily moisturizer for over six months now. I have coworkers stopping me in the hallway asking me what I&#x27;ve done cosmetically. They say my skin looks so healthy and vibrant and that I look years younger. I&#x27;m going to be 50 this June and frequently being told I don&#x27;t even look like I&#x27;m 40. Loving the results I&#x27;m getting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 14 days before bed, and it&#x27;s really amazing. I have Psoriasis, and it&#x27;s significantly has fading away. After the first night I could see a difference the next morning. I have tried every cream and ointment for my Psoriasis and have spent as much as $75.00 for prescription from Doctors to no avail. After using the Vitamin E oil you can barely see my psoriasis after only 2 weeks. I have transfer it from the hard to use bottle to a screw top plastic bottle which makes it much easier to use.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for...nothing in it except Vit E oil. I will  definitely purchase this again!</li>
    <li> Very thick, I use it in the morning and than again at night.  It works wonders, and no itching in between.</li>
    <li> I use this every day of my life on my lips. It prevents chapping, keeps them supple and young-looking. I also use it to lighten dark scars, by rubbing Vitamin E oil into it twice a day. I had a scar on my arm from a burn, and it is almost gone. I will never be without this product.</li>
    <li> nice and thick in consistency. i use it in shea butter and it adds great moisture.</li>
    <li> Great price and quality as stated. Delivered quickly. I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have used this for rough hands. It works, but feels greasy and leaves a stain on clothes.</li>
    <li> I personally hate the texture. Way too thick</li>
    <li> I put this in my shea butter hair mix. I love it. It&#x27;s also great on my skin. Yes it&#x27;s thick, but I don&#x27;t mind that at all.</li>
    <li> Product as promised -- pure Vitamin E oil.  I had bought some at CVS that was labeled Vitamin E oil and noticed when I got home that it was sesame oil.</li>
    <li> I got the product quickly enough, but was disappointed to see the ingredient as tocopheryl acetate (it does not specify d vs dl on the label).  When purchasing vitamin e I&#x27;ve found that mixed tocopherols and tocotrienols are simply the best.  Do your research and decide for yourself though...</li>
    <li> works great in my products</li>
    <li> I am impressed with the product and how it was packaged. I am unable to say if the promises of the effect of the product is true because it needs more time but so far it seem good.</li>
    <li> it really good!&lt;br /&gt;arrived really soon(exatctly the next day)&lt;br /&gt;quantity and quality qualified.&lt;br /&gt;hopes it help my skin.&lt;br /&gt;will buy more</li>
    <li> Upon use of this product, it is much thicker than Ithought it would be. It doesn&#x27;t have lots of filler oils like one I purchased before. This is pure vitamin E. Love it.</li>
    <li> I got this product to help with some scars from a surgery and I have found so many other uses for it. It is a wonder. I will buy again!</li>
    <li> I bought this to try and heal up a scar on my 4 years old and it did not work.</li>
    <li> Terribly thick. Couldn&#x27;t use. Not very good purchase. The higher the IU I suppose the thicker it is. Thus was like thick syrup or molasses.</li>
    <li> Enjoyed my vitamin E oil</li>
    <li> I was breaking open capsules to use the oil on some surgery scars.  So I bought this product.  This is SO MUCH EASIER!!!  It is working great on my scars to reduce the appearance of them.  I also put some on my chapped lips at night.  It&#x27;s also a great value for the money I have been using this product for 2 months and have hardly put a dent in the bottle.</li>
    <li> Received this product last week and love it!</li>
    <li> I am not sure why other reviewers have complained about the sticky consistency... all pure vitamin e oils are going to be very thick.  I like to mix this with jojoba oil to thin it out and use after my shower.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t pure Vitamin E oil! It&#x27;s synthetic. Waste of money!</li>
    <li> I love that I don&#x27;t have to put holes in the Vit E capsules now to put in my soap receipes.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but it is pure E Oil. which I know is great on healing scars. It was very well wrapped.</li>
    <li> I use this as a rub once in the morning and once before bedtime to keep my stretched ear lobes healthy and ready for further stretching in the future, it does its job and keeps my lobes moisturized and healthy. I&#x27;m on my third bottle now, yes I ordered this stuff three times it&#x27;s that good, and each one of these two and a half ounce bottles lasts me just shy of a year (about ten and a half months roughly). It&#x27;s a lot cheaper (even with shipping) than going to the local &amp;#34;Three letter store&amp;#34; to buy something that&#x27;s not even as pure as this stuff is. Well worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> This was purchased for help with scar healing after surgery and has worked exceptionally well.  It had a plastic insert to allow easy dispensing - something I wasn&#x27;t expecting but glad was included.</li>
    <li> I used this product in a homemade shea body butter recently and it really took the quality of the body butter to a higher level.</li>
    <li> I made a cannabis infused salve by combining Coconut Oil, Vitamin E Oil and Beeswax infused with previously vaporized cannabis. Made a very effective salve.</li>
    <li> Leaves stains on clothing, so be careful if you use this and have a shirt on or something...</li>
    <li> This oil is great. I use it in many of my formulations and it works perfectly. I love how concentrated and thick it is.</li>
    <li> gross and did not work for what i used it for</li>
    <li> This product is extremely helpful in clearing up small scars as well as conditioning my skin.  I would recommend this product to anyone who needs to take care of problematic spots on their skin.</li>
    <li> Packed well. Arrived intact and exactly as expected.</li>
    <li> It is nice to have the Vitamin E in a bottle rather than pills to pop open.  Also, that way you don&#x27;t waste half of it.</li>
    <li> Very hard to use for anything because it is so sticky! I purchased to use in homemade beauty treatments, but found it way too thick to actually be used. Consistency of molasses!</li>
    <li> Use this product for my homemade lotion. Its great. I would use it again and recommend it to any one.</li>
    <li> If you think the high IU count on this oil will make it superior or more potent than others, you&#x27;d be partially correct.  It is a good product, but does about as good as any other Vitamin E oil I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> I have used vitamin E oil for quite some time but not this brand.  Wanted to use it on a sore on my elderly Mother.  Tried it once and had to wash it off.  It was very sticky for some reason  and am not going to use it again. Have had trouble getting off my hands when I apply it.</li>
    <li> Ok...never used vitamin oil before. Now, I did use jojaba but it was runny and greasy. I got this because I use other Sundown vitamins. This oil is thick and heavy, and slow to absorb. But once it does when used overnight (not under makeup) you get soft, supple renewed skin. I recommend for anyone seeking a nightly deep treatment for normal or dry skin. I actually enjoy the thickness because a little goes a long way. One small bottle should last a while when used on face.</li>
</ol>
