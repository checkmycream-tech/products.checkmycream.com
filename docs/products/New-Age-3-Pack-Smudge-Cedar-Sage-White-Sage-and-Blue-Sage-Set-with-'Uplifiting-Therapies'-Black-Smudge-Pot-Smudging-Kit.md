      <li>THANKS AMAZON</li>
      <li>Really like the smell of the wands.</li>

<li> Fast Luck Incense Plus Canoe Incense Burner and White Sage Set]]</li>
<li> my experience too much smudge is usually creating headaches so less is more in this</li>
<li> Seems like it will last a long time.</li>
<li> The bowl is tiny, just about 3 inches across and the top is made of wood which I think is dangerous considering you&#x27;re using fire.  </li>
<li> very thin wood &amp; cover doesnt fit on well.</li>
<li> The little bowl is really too small.</li>
<li> The bundles are very short and small too.  </li>
<li> will look for other items of this merchant.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
<li> I&#x27;d give this a 3 star because for me this is like any other product that I&#x27;ve bought before.</li>
<li> It helped me get the job done and a little goes a long way!</li>
<li> not worth the price charged.</li>
<li> Not worth the money...</li>
<li> Little small for the smudge sticks</li>
<li> I was very disappointed in the size of the bowl which is represented as much larger than it really is.  </li>
<li> And the sage was really hard to work with.</li>
<li> I was disappointed with the little black container.  </li>
<li> The black chips off the bowl within a few weeks which is upsetting and annoying.</li>
<li> I am so very disappointed in this item-</li>
<li> disgusting scent ..</li>
