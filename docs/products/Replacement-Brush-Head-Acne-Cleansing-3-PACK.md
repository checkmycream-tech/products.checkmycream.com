<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> came it fast and fits clarisonic</li>
    <li> Clarisonic brush heads for this price!?  Can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Did not like!  Nothing like the real brushes from the Mia 2.</li>
    <li> Bristles are very soft but a bit longer than the Clarisonic brush heads. You must thoroughly dry the bristles to prevent odor unlike the Clarisonic brush heads.</li>
    <li> Got it after a few weeks, quite a long delivery time but is expected as it is mention in the lead time.</li>
    <li> I was nervous ordering generic brush heads. But these work really well. I will never go back to the name brand brush heads.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Works just as good as the name brand replacement brushes. Will be buying again!</li>
    <li> perfect! fits my clarsonic mia2 perfectly!!!</li>
    <li> Glad to find these - very economical!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy something generic, but these are great &amp; cheap! I would recommend.</li>
    <li> These work just the same as the name brand heads, and I am so glad because I just saved myself so much money. I was very worried that it wouldn&#x27;t cooperate with my Clarisonic Mia 2, but there is absolutely no issue!</li>
    <li> If I was given these replacement heads and the famous namebrand replacement heads I would not be able to tell the difference on how well a clean my face.&lt;br /&gt;There are however subtle differences between the actual texture of the different brush heads, the difference is not either good or bad just different.&lt;br /&gt;Value is unbeatable I will never again pay $20 for one brush head replacement again.</li>
    <li> Off brand, my GF states she can&#x27;t really notice a difference between the acne brushes she bought from sephora and these.</li>
    <li> It fit right onto my Clarisonic brush and works just like the name brand brush. However, the one tiny difference is that these brush heads (I think) are tiny bit rougher than name brand, but that might help in the long end!</li>
    <li> Great value. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Please do not hesitate to get these brushes, they are very good and worth every single cent. YOU WONT REGRET :)</li>
    <li> These fit and work with the Clairsonic easily. While they are a little rougher than Clairsonic brand, for the price, they are worth it. I have had no problems with fit, or function. Only the texture being slightly more rough.</li>
    <li> I use these on my Clarisonic plus they fit perfectly! The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the makeup doesn&#x27;t rinse off the brush as well as the original Clarisonic brush heads, worth the money!</li>
    <li> Loved them like usual!</li>
    <li> They are a little cheap version and one of them showed up broken, but they serve their purpose I suppose.</li>
    <li> Brushes were damaged when arrived!</li>
    <li> The quality is great! Thanks.</li>
    <li> These are great and work perfectly with my Clarisonic. I agree that they are a little more rough than the original Clarisonic heads but you just need to press less. Can&#x27;t beat the price! Don&#x27;t pay the price for the originals!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for about 2 months with a 2014 Mia 2. They fit and hold up great, no functional difference from the original Clarisonic heads. I rotated with my last Clarisonic head at first, just to see if I could feel or see a difference and I couldn&#x27;t. These are slightly stiffer than the Clarisonic heads but I don&#x27;t even notice it now. Skin is normal; no change from before. I don&#x27;t really want to support ripoffs but these are such a great deal that I will prob buy again.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe how INEXPENSIVE these are!  Seriously!  3 for 5 bucks??!?!  Can&#x27;t go wrong.  They seem to be no different than the name-brand ones!</li>
    <li> Initially I was happy with the product I received.  After awhile my brush began to smell foul.  This has never happened to me before with the authentic Clarisonic brush, despite using the same skin care products.  The brush is compatible with the Clarisonic Mia, but I do not think I will be repurchasing after this terrible experience.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement for the expensive original ones.</li>
    <li> exactly what i needed</li>
    <li> Same as the Clarisonic...glad I bought these because they are are a much MUCH more reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Fits my Mia 2 perfectly. Works just as well as my original brushes. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement head for my clarisonic aria. Tip: soak head in bleach to kill germs as needed. I found that for me, after a few weeks, these replacements tend to acquire a smell and bleach kills the germs that cause it. I never had that issue with the pure clarisonic head; I don&#x27;t see a need to stop using these more reasonably priced replacement heads over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using an environmentally friendly bleach if that matters (it doesn&#x27;t have chlorine).</li>
    <li> These brush heads fit the Clarisonic Mia perfectly and at a fraction of the cost. The acne brushes are also a lot softer which is very nice. I&#x27;ve recommended these to two other people so far and will continue to purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> This item is perfect for me. I am beyond pleased. Fit my clarisonic mia perfect. Bristles are soft and gentle. Though at first I had trouble getting them to work. They went on but didnt move. But I pressed in the center and it engaged and began to work so im happy.</li>
    <li> This product/price seemed way to good to be true, so I was understandably suspicious. I was SHOCKED (pleasantly) that these worked perfectly. I read some reviews that said they had problems with it fitting or staying on, but I didn&#x27;t experience this; even if I did, I don&#x27;t think that would deter me from buying again. The price makes replacing the brush heads on a regular basis much more doable. The quality may not be the exact same as the brand name, but it does its job well and the price is RIGHT - for this, it gets 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Great price, great product. This brush head works as good as the clarisonic head. Very soft. Cleans skin very well. I will be purchasing more. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Fit my clarisonic perfectly! Amazed at the price.</li>
    <li> It did not work on my original Clarasonic.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to buy these brush heads beacuse I wasn&#x27;t to sure if would actually work for my Clarisonic. However, they worked out great. They fit perfectly and are a great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> These work great in my clairsonic Mia, and at almost 1/2 the cost they are perfect.</li>
    <li> Works better than clarisonic brand and much cheaper to buy!</li>
    <li> Not quite as good as the Clarisonic brand</li>
    <li> These have really saved me money!</li>
    <li> The ACTUAL Clarisonic brush heads are around $20 each.  If you include shipping (I am approximating here) this will cost about $15 for 3; so that&#x27;s about $5 each.&lt;br /&gt;These LOOK the same as the authentic Clarisonic brush heads. But they are definitely a bit more rough.  They loosen/soften up over time due to repeated use (just like the authintic Clarisonic brushes do) so that&#x27;s good.  But I was truly caught off guard about how rough they were are first.  Personally, a bit more exfoliation doens&#x27;t hurt my skin, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me, but if you have sensitive skin, you may want to re-think this, or at least use it for a shorter amount of time than with the authentic brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: these are a passable duplicate to the Clarisonic brushes, and for the few shortcomings they do have, it is certainly worth it when you consider a $15 savings per brush.</li>
    <li> Great Price.  Appear to be similar quality to name brand brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are well made. They fit the Clarisonic beautifully, and I have had no problems with the basic use. They are, however, much less gentle than the real Clarisonic brush heads. I have very sensitive skin, evidently, and found these heads to be too rough...not to the point of causing redness or peeling, but my skin definitely felt over-exfoliated after using these. They are a great value as long as the added roughness isn&#x27;t an issue for your skin. Unfortunately, for me it is a problem, and I will have to go back to the far more expensive name brand brush heads.</li>
    <li> These work great for the price! Much better than buying the over priced brand head. Fits perfectly. I replace mine often (every month to every 2 months) so these are worth it. Definitely buying again</li>
    <li> Brushes are a little soft but good for the price</li>
    <li> I, like most of the other reviewers, thought this product must be too good to be true, but at the price, what did I have to lose? I have been using these heads for nearly a month now and I am completely satisfied. They fit my Mia 2 perfectly, and I will definitely be buying these again in the future. This is my first time using the Acne brushes instead of the regular ones, and my skin is completely clear. I also had several skin tags on my neck, and somehow using these on my neck got rid of them completely. I love these brushes!</li>
    <li> I think these are good for the price.....They seem to be a little more rough on my sensitive skin than the clarisonic brand  but at 3 for about half of the price for one they are definitely worth trying especially if your skin isn&#x27;t sensitive</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay the high price for the replacement heads for my mia.  These were just as good and much cheaper.  I am glad I ordered them.</li>
    <li> These are good brush heads. Feel that there&#x27;s no difference between these and the expensive ones. Definately a good buy.</li>
    <li> I HAVE THE CLARASONIC BRUSH AND THOUGHT I COULD GO CHEAPER ON THESE BRUSH HEADS,. I&#x27;M ON THE SECOND ONE OF THIS 3 PACK AND I&#x27;M JUST NOT FEELING GOOD ABOUT CHOOSING THESE. I&#x27;M WONDERING IF I&#x27;M GETTING THE SAME ROTATING HEAD ACTION, AND I&#x27;M ALSO WONDERING IF THERE IS A HYPOALLERGIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL CLARASONIC BRUSH AND THESE.</li>
    <li> These are definitely not as firm as the Clarisonic brush heads but still definitely worth it at this price!  I will buy them again for sure.</li>
    <li> My skin is clear and very smooth.</li>
    <li> Does fit but not work on my Clairisonic.</li>
    <li> Excellent and affordable alternative to the brand name replacement heads.</li>
    <li> I have only ever used the original brush head that came with my clarisonic, but I wanted to try the acne crush head and opted for the less espensive alternative by buying this. In comparison to the original clarisonic the generic acne brush from this seller is rougher and absorbs make up residue more than the original. I normally use Johnson and Johnson&#x27;s baby shampoo to wash my face (make up and all); it usually leaves the clarisonic brush head clean without residue. When I wash with the generic acne brush head, its not always residue free. When I wash the brush, the bristles are clean and color free again, but I have to wash it a lot more often than with the original. All in all, its a good alternative and would buy again.</li>
    <li> Compared to the original product, this is very good quality for the price paid. The only different I noticed is the length of the bristles. They tend to be just.... a bit longer because when I move the brush in circular motion, it&#x27;s a bit draggy. Other than that, it works great with the Clarisonic. I have the original Clarisonic by the way.</li>
    <li> Confession: I never bought a name brand replacement head, but I am loving using my brush again with these new heads at least as much as I did when it was brand new. The quality seems great. I will order these again. And for the price, it could be a lot worse and I&#x27;d STILL order it again. So, like I said, I&#x27;m thrilled that the quality and price are as good as they are.</li>
    <li> I got the real ones for several times. So when I got this, I can see it&#x27;s fake by just one glance. This is even worse than the Delicate Cleansing (GENERIC) 4 Pack commended by dealmoon. If you want the low price, it&#x27;s okay. But if you treat your face seriously, I suggest you get the real Clarisonic brush heads, although it might cost you more.</li>
    <li> i dont see it yet... it was delivered in friends house&lt;br /&gt;when i go to EUA in december/14 i can say more</li>
    <li> These even say &amp;#34;Clarisonic&amp;#34; on them just like the regular brush heads.  They are very cheap replacements and work identically to the ones that came with the unit as far as I can tell.  No complaints, give them a try - you might even be able to afford to change them as often as the company recommends at this price point.</li>
    <li> I was worried because the price was so low. These come from China (so that&#x27;s why shipping takes longer) and I read the reviews that said the bristles were too hard, I thought they were a touch too soft, but I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks and I haven&#x27;t noticed too much difference than the pricey original that I was using. It is more difficult to get on and off, but not a big deal after you figure it out. I have a harder time getting the lid off of it so I swapped that out for a real clarisonic lid and that works fine for me. I would buy these again!</li>
    <li> These are a perfect fit for my mia and they arrived quickly. The brush heads are gentle. I really love my mia and I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> Bought for clarisonic, doesn&#x27;t seem to do as good a job, and makes the device a little noisier</li>
    <li> I just received the package yesterday and was somewhat surprised that it was an international package shipped from Guangdong, China. They do look and feel the same on the hand as the previous original brush. I am however a little suspicious about the price difference (drastically) and the source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will report back once I actually start using the product.</li>
    <li> I thought they were very cheap at first but then after snapping it in place to my clear sonic brush it worked great! I am only get my replacement heads online from now on.</li>
    <li> To harsh on my face, making my face break out everytime I use it.</li>
    <li> Shipped very quickly and the brushes are great!</li>
    <li> I bought this product hoping to try a generic and cheaper alternative to the patented clarisonic brush heads and I got exactly what I paid for. First off, I&#x27;m surprised they&#x27;re even allowed to continue peddling this crappy knock off after they blatantly copy the Clarisonic brand. It&#x27;s one thing to position yourself as a generic brand but this company is downright pretending to be Clarisonic- the imagery is clearly a have baked photocopy of the real Clarisonic box and upon further inspection is riddled with typos and fake patent information. This is a product I would&#x27;ve expected had I bought it off of some street vendor in New York toting the name &amp;#34;Flarisonic&amp;#34; or something. As for the product itself, I might as well have tried to clean my face with my electric toothbrush. The price point for real Clarisonic brush heads comes from their patented finishing technology that gives each bristle a rounded effect so that the harsh edges don&#x27;t give your skin micro abrasions. They also use a material that prevents the absorption of bacteria which this sub par knock off does not. Within one use, the brush started discoloring from my makeup not to mention leaving my skin feeling tight and damaged. I WILL NOT fall for this hoax again. If you care about your skin at all, you&#x27;ll only use their official Clarisonic product.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed at these brush heads. They got dirty very quickly. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first because the price was so low.  But after using the product, I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  The price was reasonable, it shipped and arrived on time, and they work great.</li>
    <li> These are great. Fit perfectly and are (to me) even better then the official brush heads. Can&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
    <li> The price is right, but I have to say when you compare the brushes to legit Clarisonic acne type brush heads, these are rougher feeling on my face for sure. The acne brush head is supposed to have slightly shorter &amp;#34;gradation&amp;#34; on the green bristles for a gentler touch, as stated on the Clarisonic website, but this generic brush does not have this feature and therefore feels abrasive on my sensitive skin. If this is the case with you, you probably shouldn&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> These are AFFORDABLE replacement brushes that work just as well as the original equipment. It&#x27;s crazy what the Clarisonic-branded brushes cost. I plan to buy these from now on.</li>
    <li> Work just as well as Clarisonic brush heads, and they cost much less. Love!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as soft as the real thing. It&#x27;s actually quite tough and rough on the skin... but it hasn&#x27;t caused me any skin irritation or issues from my observation. Therefore, it does the work. For me anyways.</li>
    <li> Really Good brush heads.  I use them on my clarisonic mia 2 and they work just as well as the clarisonic brand.  Saved me money but I didn&#x27;t have to miss out on quality.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my purchase.no difference from the one bought from the store.i will purchase some more!!!great product!</li>
    <li> A little bit hard. Overall, good product</li>
    <li> Great for the price!!</li>
    <li> This is my second time ordering these brushes. This time I got 12 brushes for about the price of one name brand brush, last order I got about 8 brushes for the price of one. I like that I can change my brush head once a month whereas before I would try to stretch it 3 months because they were so expensive. My face has thanked me for switching them out so often also! I honestly can&#x27;t tell the difference between name brand and these, except the price. I haven&#x27;t experienced any smells with the bristles like other reviews say either.</li>
    <li> Not a direct replacement for the original. The brushes tend to come apart after a while and you have to pop that back together..</li>
    <li> Works just as well as the more expensive brand name replacement brushes! Wonderful value for a great product!!</li>
    <li> It works but it&#x27;s not as gentle as the brand version</li>
    <li> This is a great buy. The only minus is that it&#x27;s hard to detach the inner from the outer brush. You get the hang of it, but at first it&#x27;s annoying. Still, no regrets at this price.</li>
    <li> Love! Will order again.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant after seeing the huge price difference between these and the original clarisonic replacement brushes but decided to give them a try anyway and I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;I got 3 \\&quot;acne\\&quot; heads for just over $10 ( including shipping). What a steal! Just one usually costs over 20 bucks!&lt;br /&gt;I received my order within 3 days and couldn&#x27;t be happier. The head fits perfectly and the bristles are super soft and do a fantastic job cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be buying these again!</li>
    <li> Brush heads fit and look very similar to the name brand ones, but they are rougher on my skin.</li>
    <li> Are they as good as the original? I can&#x27;t tell the difference, it&#x27;s probably mostly placebo for people&lt;br /&gt;Are they a good substitute? Oh yeah, 5 stars for value alone.</li>
    <li> These were namebrand, and exactly what I was looking for! Pleasantly surprised with this purchase!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the same as the brand names! But for a way better price! Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase!</li>
    <li> These are priced very affordably and they still fit my Clarisonic perfectly. Shipping took a little longer than a few days but was from overseas. I don&#x27;t mind waiting for these because they are such a good deal. I will continue to order these replacement heads in the future.</li>
    <li> love this! I would clean my face with nothing else. Use this on my clarisonic brush every night and my shin feels great</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> Reasonable price, good quality</li>
    <li> initiallybecause it was not clarisonic brand, it did not fit perfectly. after some time, i realized water was under the brush head causing disgusting amounts of mildew</li>
    <li> This product is not a clarisonic product. I ordered three weeks ago and it arrived in a package from china.</li>
    <li> Soft. Fit my clairsonic perfectly. Would buy again</li>
    <li> Will never go back to the namebrand. I bought these for my daughter and myself. These work just as well as the clarisonic. Recommended you buy new ones every 3 months so with 2 of us that can be expensive. These are well made. Fit well and honestly seem to work just as well.</li>
    <li> Awesome value!! Showed up on time and I could not tell the difference from the clarisonic acne cleansing brush heads;)</li>
    <li> Glad I found these. Much cheaper than the Clarisonic heads, but work just as well. I will buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> Does not work w the Clarisonic Mia 2</li>
    <li> These fit perfectly and are of the proper quality. Good value and product.</li>
    <li> Fit a bit snugger in the handle than the clairsonic brand, but they work</li>
    <li> Very affordable versions for the Clarisonic Mia. They feel just the same, not louder or anything.&lt;br /&gt;For the cost, they certainly are a better choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but these work just as well as the name brand brush heads! I cannot tell the difference, except in the huge amount of money I save!</li>
    <li> fabulous...can&#x27;t tell any difference...great price</li>
    <li> GREAT purchase. less than $6.00 for 3 of them compared to  $27 a piece at ULTA</li>
    <li> These brushes work well and certainly a lot cheaper then the name brand. If you need brushes I suggest you give them a try.</li>
    <li> softer than the real things but worth the price</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, it fits my clarisonic mia. I was using the normal brush for  a while and my skin wasnt really liking that brush and i didnt notice until i bought these brushes. my skin immediately looked different and clearer. i am very happy i purchased these brushes. i wont buy any other brush than these since they worked better for my skin compared to the original clarisonic brush head. If you have acne this brush will definitely help. If you see that your clarisonic isnt working well for your skin you might just not have found the right brush, dont give up. The brush itself is soft and nice and doesnt look or feel cheap. Just make sure you disinfect it a lot to expand the life span.</li>
    <li> the fit and work perfectly like the clarisonic name brand</li>
    <li> These are great, and so much cheaper than the genuine clarisonic heads. I&#x27;ll never buy these retail again.</li>
    <li> Really soft brushes! Work great with my Mia and Lancome facewash gel. This is my second purchase and I will continue to use these as my go to replacement brushes.</li>
    <li> As described. These fit my MIA Clarisonic just fine. The only issue would&#x27;ve been the shipping, which I was fully aware of thanks to other reviewers.  But even though the shipping told me estimated arrival was about 2 months out, it came a few weeks earlier than that and I was not in any rush so I was pleased! I&#x27;m happy and will order again! Plus they were soft.</li>
    <li> These arent as good as the originals, very soft.</li>
    <li> its not the same as the clarisonic brush. the tip of each brush is rectangular flat, not as the clarisonic  its rounded brush end. I don&#x27;t know if you get it. i am talking about every tiny strands its much harder on you skin. so If you have sensitive skin, think twince!</li>
    <li> Usually I purchase Clairsonic replacement brush heads from Nordstroms or Sephora for $25-$30 EACH (+tax) . I decided to  purchase brush heads from Amazon. They came early and they turned out to be perfect, they work I get more brushes for the amount I spent for 1...that also means means less trips to the mall..lol! Saving money ALL THE WAY around!!</li>
    <li> Amazing. Fits perfectly and the best part is I didn&#x27;t have have pay $40/each!</li>
    <li> These are just as good as the brand name - a great bargain.  Now instead of trying to make the brand name brush head last for months, I can replace it with an affordable new head as often as I want.</li>
    <li> I have a clarisonic PRO.  The bushes fit great and feel exactly the same. to be honest I had zero expectations because some of the reviews.  I will continue to purchase these brushes.  They are exactly the same to me and work in my machine the same, and they came quickly.</li>
    <li> Work great with my Clarisonic!</li>
    <li> I bought them for my children (teenagers) and they love them. They are happy. I&#x27;m happy  :)</li>
    <li> Perfect. Received quickly</li>
    <li> I have the clarisonic plus and these brushes work perfectly. They are a perfect fit and are a little softer than the brush that came with my clarasonic which I like better because it isn&#x27;t so rough on my skin. I will definitely be purchasing these again!</li>
    <li> Does not work with the Clarisonic brush - it grinds and makes noise but does not turn properly. I tried using it just as a &#x27;scrubbing&#x27; brush but the bristles are very stiff and irritated my skin. I would not buy this product again or recommend it.</li>
    <li> Work just as well as the name brand, more expensive brushes.</li>
    <li> I waited to find these and will never go back to the ones from the Clarisonic people because of the price. This replacement makes the Mia worth buying. Because if you have to spend $25 every couple of months to replace the head, it make it too expensive of a daily treatment along with a cleanser like a philosophy purity cleanser.  Love it. But I will say this is a bit of a deep cleansing replacement.  I&#x27;ve only use the regular replacement and this seems to scrub it a lot more than the regular. So if you skin is sensitive don&#x27;t buy this one. I just use it less 2x per week. Love it.</li>
    <li> In all honestly, these brush heads are better than Clarisonic&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> These brushes do not work properly with the Mia.  The middle portion does not rotate.  I would not bother purchasing this knock-off brand.</li>
    <li> These brushes are super soft and fit with the generic Clarisonic style face scrubbers. Great quality and can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> did not work on my Clarsonic Mia 2. returned</li>
    <li> They fit perfectly for my clarisonic and are cheaper to by for a 3 pack</li>
    <li> for some reason this brush head made my skin break out more than normal - not sure if it is because it is not a Clarisonic brand or maybe not anti-microbial?  Usually is the Sensitive Skin brush and that was great - noticed more breakouts with this one - at least in the beginning. Also, my brushes bristles  were smooshed and flattened when they arrived.</li>
    <li> These work just as well as the clarisonic heads.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> These brushes are NOT comparable to Clarisonic&#x27;s brushes. I&#x27;m not a hater, and I&#x27;m all for a good deal, but when you spend $100 on a device, you expect it to work really well. Well, with brushes like these that don&#x27;t end up moving with the intensity that the true brushes do (I think the mechanism on the back isn&#x27;t a totally tight fit, perhaps, you may as well end up going back to the ol&#x27; washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still don&#x27;t want to spend what Clarisonic charges for brush heads, but these are not the answer.</li>
    <li> Yes, it is fake but still works just as well as the original. The point of buying this is to save money. The seller never claims they are not fakes.  They work the same and fit perfectly. I would buy these everytime!</li>
    <li> These are just as good as the original (expensive) heads. I am very satisfied with these heads and am SO glad I tried these and saved a bunch of money.</li>
    <li> A little bit rough but not bad with my sonicare.</li>
    <li> These brush heads are fantastic! The three pack is a great deal considering one of these usually costs around 20 bucks. The quality is anything but &amp;#34;generic.&amp;#34; I WILL purchase again! Thanks!</li>
    <li> These fit well for the Mia, but they were slightly less stiff than the original brush.  Definitely a good value though.</li>
    <li> These work great and are so much cheaper than buying from the name brand.</li>
    <li> My Clarisonic is relatively new and I only ever had the original brush head that came with it, so I don&#x27;t know what Clarisonic&#x27;s brand of acne cleansing heads usually feels like. When it was time to change heads and I used one of these, I expected that it would feel a little more aggressive than the regular head, but I was surprised that it was ultra-soft. That sounds nice but I was actually a little concerned with that because I want a good, deep-pore scrub. They fit the Clarisonic perfectly though, so for someone who likes a softer brush this is nice. I&#x27;d just prefer something a little more scrubby.</li>
    <li> Before I got mine I was hesitant b/c of such a cheap price but wow, awesome!! Super soft just like the actual clarisonic heads. A must buy if you need new ones!!</li>
    <li> These replacement brush are GREAT!!!  My face saw a instance great results after one use.  My face look so much brighter after each use.  I have oily skin and I notice less oil throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This is a great buy--I&#x27;m back to order another pack. Are they really Clarisonic? I compared them side-by-side to the real deal and couldn&#x27;t tell the difference. The caps on them are identical to the worn-out one I was about to toss that was real Clarisonic. Doesn&#x27;t matter to me as long as they work the same, and they do.</li>
    <li> Why waste the money on the name brand Clarisonic brushes?  I doubt you will notice a difference.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t vibrate on my PRO the it&#x27;s supposed to, I might as well manually clean my face</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you pay for. These are an OK brush head, but no where near as nice as the Clarisonic ones they are supposed to replace. The bristles are much softer and the interior doesn&#x27;t rotate. I don&#x27;t feel like they exfoliate as well either. Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> Great value compared to health and beauty store prices</li>
    <li> these work great with my machine !!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the brush heads I was sent didn&#x27;t fit my device, but the issue was quickly resolved. So I&#x27;m giving 5 stars for excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> Fantastic price! Just a fraction of the cost of clarisonic replacement heads and they worm just as well as the cationic heads.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! I purchased 6 for the price of 1 from the high dollar competitor! Found no difference in them what so ever!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Works with Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> I love how soft the bristles are on this thing! I have rather sensitive skin and too much abrasion makes me break out even worst!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially getting three of them for a relatively low price!  THAT&#x27;S a real bargain!</li>
    <li> The first time I ordered these, the brushes were soft and lasted for roughly three months of use! But I ordered a new set of three, and they get rough and harsh on your skin within a week or so of use. They must have lowered their production costs and changed the material.. no good anymore :(</li>
    <li> Wow, whoever thinks these brush heads are awesome must be smoking.  These are basically old, worn brushes.  The bristles are damn near soft enough to apply blush to your cheeks.  I could use my current Clarisonic brush for a couple years, and it would still be more effective than this pure unadulterated crap!</li>
    <li> These brush heads were almost exactly the same as my Clarisonic brand heads. They feel a little bit rougher on the face, but not by much. Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell a difference between these and the $35 one you would buy at the store</li>
    <li> These are just as good as the Clarisonic brand and last equally as long. Gentle, soft, and wonderful quality for the price. Will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> Duplicate for clarisonic</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know they were the generic form of the clarasonic brush.</li>
    <li> The brushes were not the same quality as those made by Clarisonic. They were slightly cheaper in materials but work just fine.</li>
    <li> It fits well, but I used it for about 2 weeks and then it started scratching up my face.</li>
    <li> I have been really pleased with these replacement heads for my Clarisonic Mia.  I compared this on with a higher cost replacement brush and did not notice a difference.</li>
    <li> I love these.  I got them for myself for my Clarisonic.  Great Price.  Feel just the same to me.  I have been using the Clarisonic for probably 10 years and still have the same one.  They fit great and are so much more inexpensive than the Clarisonic Brand.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> these are great. maybe not as perfect and high end like the real clairsonic brushes, but they do the job well at a quarter of the price!</li>
    <li> Very close to the Clarasonic brand and MUCH less expensive!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for acne prone skin</li>
    <li> the bristles are uneven and very rough--more rough than my deep cleansing brush. I thought, &amp;#34;how bad can the be? I&#x27;m not that picky&amp;#34;. Yeah, these are pretty bad. The bristles are off center leaving a gap in the brush head on one side. That didn&#x27;t bother me till I realized they were all unevenly cut. It is a little like putting your face on a bed of nails--many together don&#x27;t feel painful but just a few sticking out really hurts! These are going in the trash. Save yourself a little money and look elsewhere. I&#x27;m cheap but I&#x27;m not that cheap.</li>
    <li> The brushes are horrible! They don&#x27;t fit correctly or move in a circular motion for the clarisonic. I&#x27;ll just go back to buying the authentic clarisonic brush heads.</li>
    <li> Brushes are a lot cheaper than regular brushes. I was just hoping bristles would be a little but harder.</li>
    <li> These brush heads fit perfectly in my Clarisonic Mia. The brush heads feel soft to the touch but are actually very exfoliating on my skin. I would buy these out of stock if I could! Great deal, great quality!</li>
    <li> I have been enjoying this purchase. Sometimes we take risks in paying less for a product expecting the same results as the brand product. But this product did not disappoint and I believe it was half the price. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Purchased these for my wife, decided to give them a try over the expensive brand name brushes they emulate.  I must say that under visual comparison they are almost identical even down the to included clear cover caps, and according to my wife they seem to be lasting just as long as the brand name brushes.  Overall these are a great product for the price!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed for a price so much cheaper than in the store!</li>
    <li> Looks just like original brush heads amazing !!!</li>
    <li> These work great on my Clarsonic Mia2. Price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother trying to save a few bucks. Not like the real clarisonic brushes, and they run down the battery charge much faster.</li>
    <li> These fit my brush perfectly.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied will buy again!</li>
    <li> A.Lil rough but the work ok</li>
    <li> Great price and fast shipping!</li>
