      <li>Received my brushes fast!  </li>
      <li>One of the brushes feel apart the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>the brushed are ok and serve their purpose</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
      <li>My brushes came in 1 month exactly.</li>
      <li>They come in a nice little pouch.  </li>
      <li>, you can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
      <li>they work really well</li>
      <li>Highly recommended to any nail artist!</li>
      <li>and it was fast shipping</li>
      <li>Really decent brushes, noting fancy</li>
      <li>You get what you pay for, but for the quality of the brush themselves, you get a little more.</li>
      <li>Love this little set.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the brushes are great for nail art.</li>
      <li>but other than that they were fine.</li>

      <li>2 more had broken just by me gently grabbing one at a time to get them out of the plastic package</li>
      <li>Other than that, they work pretty well!</li>
      <li>I was cleaning the brushes and as I was wiping off the cream I use to make them clean, the silver Part came off of the pink wooden stick.</li>
      <li>So what I did was stick the wooden stick into the silver pet, and wrap some clear tape around it.</li>
      <li>The one thing that bugs me though is that the metal is not attached to pink handles very well</li>
      <li>so they really get all the little details I need.</li>

<li> they are small</li>
<li> Just received my 15pcs set and 5 or the tops was broken already in the package.</li>
<li> Thank you one was  broken but still can use</li>
<li> Some Were Broken</li>
<li> A little bit of hot/super glue fixes it, but was a bit annoying.</li>
<li> Smells so bad..</li>
<li> These are the absoulte worst brushes ever.</li>
<li> Horrible.</li>

    <li> Smells so bad.. Its a plastic smell that doesnt go away. One paint brush lost all the bristles and they were all over the package and my table. Kind of wish i didnt spend like $4 on this but its at an okay use right now.</li>
    <li> Thank you one was  broken but still can use</li>

The one thing that bugs me though is that the metal is not attached to pink handles very well and so when I received this I had to &amp;#34;assemble&amp;#34; them. A little bit of hot/super glue fixes it, but was a bit annoying.</li>

    <li> One of the brushes feel apart the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for a really reasonable price, I actually purchased it with the intent to use it on my acrylic/watercolor paintings, not my nails but I like them all the same!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re nice and very inexpensive but the silver part would sometimes come out.</li>
    <li> the brushed are ok and serve their purpose but I just got glued the tips back on when they came off</li>
    <li> Item has described received my order on time they are good quality defantly a great price for a great item thank u</li>

    <li> It came WAY before the expected delivery date.  Which was awesome. They are great I use them every day at work.</li>
    <li> These started falling apart immediately.  Cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the price. Wish the handles would have been available in additional colors. Makes professional looking nails by a non-professional.</li>
    <li> For the price, they are adequate. A nice first set to start your nail art journey.</li>
    <li> Received my brushes fast!  Love it!</li>
    <li> On the fan brush, the hairs started falling out as soon as i got them</li>
    <li> Perfect for my daughter to use</li>
    <li> The heads kept falling off.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT but it take so long to delivery,,,</li>
    <li> Came early and great quality!  Highly recommended to any nail artist!</li>
    <li> the metal pieces came off when using these wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great price, and unbeatable!</li>
    <li> IBought These As A GiftAnd When I Received Then Some Were Broken I DidNt Try Them SoI Don&#x27;t Know Quality Besides WhatI Saw</li>
    <li> Just got it, as described</li>
    <li> Good but not what i expected</li>
    <li> one brush was missing, there were duplicate brushes in there</li>
    <li> Ok so I&#x27;ve noticed that some reviews are for ditting tools and others are for tape so im guessing that the seller just switches products. My brushes came in 1 month exactly. I got all of them. One of them looked bent but if you look in the picture, it&#x27;s meant to be like that. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the brushes are great for nail art. But they do have minor flaws. Like the pink starts wearing off if it touches nail polish remover or if you soak it in water. The hairs themselves are nice and packed and obviously the acetone on them doesn&#x27;t affect them. I was cleaning the brushes and as I was wiping off the cream I use to make them clean, the silver Part came off of the pink wooden stick. I tried super glue but it just kept coming off. So what I did was stick the wooden stick into the silver pet, and wrap some clear tape around it.This has solved my issue. They come in a nice little pouch.  You get what you pay for, but for the quality of the brush themselves, you get a little more.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this, they said it would be delivered between October 3rd and October 22nd. I received this in the mail today and was super excited! It came in a plastic travel pouch and looked just as they stated. All of the brushes seem good quality and I can&#x27;t wait to use them to create new designs!!! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> i got it and it is really nice. they work really well and you can use them as paint brushes</li>
    <li> It was ok made. On a couple brushes, the metal was bent. You get what you pay for. Other than that, they work pretty well!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected them to be and have a reasonable price</li>
    <li> These nail art brush set is of very Good quality,very impressive, well packed.Definately you must buy it.</li>
    <li> Reasonable price they work great for nail art</li>
    <li> Just received my 15pcs set and 5 or the tops was broken already in the package. And 3 of them fell off when I tool them all out. A total of 8 that was broken. Horrible.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> For the price they&#x27;re fab!</li>
    <li> They sucked. All came apart no good!!&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money at all. NOT RECOMMEND to anyone.</li>
    <li> We ordered this for my teen daughter. She wanted it to make designs on her nails and she was thrilled with them. She loves to show off her nails and explain which brush she used this time.</li>
    <li> Not the best but will work for what I need</li>
    <li> Really decent brushes, noting fancy but they work good</li>
    <li> Cane in fast and works ok.</li>
    <li> The color of the stick came off right when it touched some spaniel polish remover. Over all it&#x27;s still in good shape.</li>
    <li> just what I needed for my nails.</li>
    <li> They work fine. One of the brush heads came off and I had to glue it back om but other than that they were fine.</li>
    <li> Cant&#x27; wait to try some new designs... especially the feather brush</li>
    <li> Love this little set. These are a great price and the brushes are easy to wash and use. These are great for anyone who does their nails for themselves!</li>
