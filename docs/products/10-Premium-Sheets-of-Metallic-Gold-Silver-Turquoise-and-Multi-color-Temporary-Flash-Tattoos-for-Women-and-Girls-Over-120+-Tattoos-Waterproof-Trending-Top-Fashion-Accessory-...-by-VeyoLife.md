      <li>I&#x27;m quite pleased with how easy they were to apply.</li>
      <li>An ideal location would be around rib cage, collar bone or lower back area even.</li>
      <li>Super cute and lasts for a couple days.</li>
      <li>/&gt;*I received these free for testing and reviewing purposes.</li>
      <li>Everyone that sees them, wants their own.</li>
      <li>With so many tattoos to choose from, I couldn&#x27;t decide which ones to put on first.</li>
      <li>They stayed on through swimming and fun and came off easly once home!</li>
      <li>We brought these along for a party weekend at the river, and they were so much fun!</li>
      <li>Cute for the first 3 hours, then they rapidly deteriorate.</li>
      <li>These things are cool, shiny and colorful; easy to apply.</li>
      <li>But there are cool geo ones that you can take.</li>
      <li>Wish they didn&#x27;t rub off so easily, but it was a festival in Alabama in the summer, so hot and humid.</li>
      <li>I noticed that other companies offered a more type specific choice, but the colors offered here were unique and brilliant.</li>
      <li>They still looked great and they still last a while if you&#x27;re just going about your normal business!</li>
      <li>The tattoo comes off whole in one easy step.</li>
      <li>even after swimming and hot tubbin!</li>
      <li>My kids also had fun getting some on too.</li>
      <li>These were so much fun.</li>
      <li>Teenagers or seniors will have fun with these.</li>
      <li>I have never had enough guts to get a real tattoo, but I&#x27;ve always loved tattoos.</li>
      <li>I was pretty skeptical as to whether or not these would be super cheesy or look awesome once I applied them, but I am happy to report that they all look amazing.</li>
      <li>I love the variety of designs available, I think this set has a better variety than some of the more expensive brands out there too.</li>
      <li>They are super metallic and shiny and apply really well.</li>
      <li>Really on fleek!</li>
      <li>They are exactly what she wanted.</li>
      <li>My only criticism, a more type specific selection would be a better purchase (i.e. beach, flowers, etc.).</li>
      <li>So cute and last for like 5 days.</li>
      <li>and this pack has such a good variety of different designs.</li>
      <li>These temp tats are high quality and fun to wear.</li>
      <li>They last quite a while, but are easy to remove with oil.</li>
      <li>Very affordable.</li>
      <li>Of course, DO place one where your skin won&#x27;t move too much.</li>
      <li>They are also not irritating.</li>
      <li>These apply really well.</li>
      <li>All the kids and even the big kids (adults) had fun getting ourselves decorated!</li>
      <li>Big fun for all ages and all occasions!  </li>
      <li>my above review is true, BUT I did wear these while in the Dominican Republic for a week.</li>
      <li>They lasted for at most, a week and a half.</li>
      <li>The metallic tattoos were overall worth the price.</li>
      <li>The gold ones are stunning, even on my pale complexion.</li>
      <li>Wow, lots of tattoos included in this pack!</li>
      <li>At first it kind of feels weird</li>
      <li>Found more (after purchase) at local Walmart for less.</li>
      <li>They last about 2 days before they get super faded on me, but I&#x27;m a very active person in a hot and humid climate</li>
      <li>Nothing rubbing alcohol couldn&#x27;t clear.</li>
      <li>Ordered these for my 17 yr old daughter.</li>
      <li>so I will update accordingly, but so far these are both water and time</li>
      <li>Everyone sported at least a couple of the metallic tattoos, men and women alike, and it really added a fun element to the festivities.</li>
      <li>Very very long lasting haha</li>
      <li>These tattoos are easy to apply and they last for at least three days....</li>
      <li>Large selection of tats with a few categories to choose from.</li>

<li> After about 5-7 days the gold started to dye my skin a bit green.</li>

<li> really hard to wash off</li>

    <li> great price for the large packet. Nice assortment</li>
    <li> We brought these along for a party weekend at the river, and they were so much fun! Everyone sported at least a couple of the metallic tattoos, men and women alike, and it really added a fun element to the festivities.</li>
    <li> These are great tattoos, they stay on really well and this pack has such a good variety of different designs. They apply so easily, and i have had mine on for 4 days and they still look great. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Ordered these for my 17 yr old daughter. She loves them. They are exactly what she wanted. They arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Found more (after purchase) at local Walmart for less.</li>
    <li> Beautiful patterns and cool designs! These apply really well. But my complaint is that they are not very durable- they rub off after only one day.</li>
    <li> I thought it will be on my body for long time but after two days it was gone. Disappointed but I like it olso.</li>
    <li> These things are cool, shiny and colorful; easy to apply. They last for Approx. a week depending on location and abrasion (like clothing, shoes etc.). To take off, We use &amp;#34;goof off&amp;#34; which is basically paint stripper applied to skin. It states to use oil, which with some elbow grease, could work, but surely not as effective. My GF wears them every weekend at our beach place and I don&#x27;t have to worry about permanent ink. Large selection of tats with a few categories to choose from. My only criticism, a more type specific selection would be a better purchase (i.e. beach, flowers, etc.). Some of the more eclectic selections will not be used. I noticed that other companies offered a more type specific choice, but the colors offered here were unique and brilliant.</li>
    <li> The metallic tattoos were overall worth the price. With so many tattoos to choose from, I couldn&#x27;t decide which ones to put on first. They lasted for at most, a week and a half. There were several that only lasted for four days at least. Overall, I would recommend these metallic tattoos.</li>
    <li> Great price for a TON of flash tattoos. Wish they didn&#x27;t rub off so easily, but it was a festival in Alabama in the summer, so hot and humid. But all around a great buy.</li>
    <li> Perfect party tattoo set. We had a blast with our friends doing tons of tattoos on the 4th of July :)</li>
    <li> If you have a girls weekend coming up or a group gathering these tattoos are a must. Beautiful colors, great selection of jewelry pieces to wear on your neck, your back or ankle. Make your choice, cut it out, wash the area to apply. Turn upside down with wet rag for 30 seconds. Everyone that sees them, wants their own. Teenagers or seniors will have fun with these. They stayed on for a week. Baby oil takes them off. Very affordable.</li>
    <li> Cute for the first 3 hours, then they rapidly deteriorate. I put multiples of these on before going on a long car ride and they all started to come off. They had no friction or clothing chafing on them, in other words no reason to come off so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and as described.</li>
    <li> really hard to wash off</li>
    <li> They were just as expected! Many great variations and colors. Applied easily and stayed! Of course, DO place one where your skin won&#x27;t move too much. An ideal location would be around rib cage, collar bone or lower back area even. Arms, wrists take a lot of friction through out the day .. So I learned with these! But, I loved them!</li>
    <li> So far these are great! Ive had mine on for the past 48 hours, and showered this morning and no sign of wear and tear. Going to the Dominican Republic next week so I will update accordingly, but so far these are both water and time resistant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;So my above review is true, BUT I did wear these while in the Dominican Republic for a week. Basically, these only last a couple of hours to a day if you&#x27;re going to be laying on the beach and in and out of the water all day. I changed my rating from 5 to 4 stars because I was a little disappointed that they came off so fast with just a quick dip in the ocean, but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m surprised. They still looked great and they still last a while if you&#x27;re just going about your normal business!</li>
    <li> Super cute and lasts for a couple days. Will buy more when I&#x27;m out. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> Very very long lasting haha it made for an awkward day of work after wearing one on my arm over the weekend. Even lots of scrubing and alcohol couldn&#x27;t get it off.</li>
    <li> These temporary tattoos reminded me of my childhood. I have never had enough guts to get a real tattoo, but I&#x27;ve always loved tattoos. Now I can get stylish tattoos without it being permanent. I&#x27;m quite pleased with how easy they were to apply. Plus the quality is remarkable. They are quite noticeable too. My kids also had fun getting some on too.</li>
    <li> These were so much fun. My kids both love them. They are super metallic and shiny and apply really well. It only takes like 30 seconds to apply and they never rip or come off partially. The tattoo comes off whole in one easy step. They last quite a while, but are easy to remove with oil. The designs are really cute and even though they’re for women and girls there were lots of designs my son could choose too. At first it kind of feels weird but after a little while you can’t even feel it on your skin. They are also not irritating. I haven’t had a problem with them on my skin, nor have the kiddos. Basically these are pretty awesome!</li>
    <li> Worked easily, looked awesome, even for adults! Good quality</li>
    <li> leaves a ring of green around the outside of the tattoo</li>
    <li> Amazing bang for the buck! These tattoos are easy to apply and they last for at least three days.... even after swimming and hot tubbin! I hear Beyonce is selling these for like $50 a dozen. Listen kids: do yourself a favor and buy these instead. Yeah, there are some cheezy ones. But there are cool geo ones that you can take. (Then give all the seashell &amp; turtle ones and give to your little brother.)&lt;br /&gt;I put the triangle ones and put them on my hands. Really on fleek! (ha)</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE!! My cousin got these for a family reunion and EVERYONE had a blast with them! All the kids and even the big kids (adults) had fun getting ourselves decorated! They stayed on through swimming and fun and came off easly once home! Big fun for all ages and all occasions!  I have a bacholorette party coming up and I am going to buy some for all of is girls to wear out in vegas!</li>
    <li> These temp tats are high quality and fun to wear.</li>

I love the variety of designs available, I think this set has a better variety than some of the more expensive brands out there too. They last about 2 days before they get super faded on me, but I&#x27;m a very active person in a hot and humid climate so they may last longer on someone else. I really loved these and can&#x27;t recommend them enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received these free for testing and reviewing purposes. All opinions are 100% my own*</li>
    <li> So cute and last for like 5 days. Best deal I found on Amazon</li>
    <li> so many compliments and so many choices</li>
    <li> Wow, lots of tattoos included in this pack! The gold ones are stunning, even on my pale complexion. After about 5-7 days the gold started to dye my skin a bit green. Nothing rubbing alcohol couldn&#x27;t clear.</li>
