      <li>And the price on this set is very, very good -</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re also a nice width, and the tiger-stripey color looks very attractive in wheat-blonde hair.</li>

      <li>This clip is ok.  </li>
      <li>I was able to twist my hair up and into these clips with no problem.</li>
      <li>I love this clip.</li>
      <li>I think it would work better on curly hair.  </li>
      <li>said to myself, &amp;#34;I know I can do better than this at Amazon.&amp;#34</li>
      <li>I love these clips.</li>
      <li>The clips are great - if you do not  have too much hair.</li>
      <li>I love these</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this clip.</li>
      <li>And now I have 3 of my favorite clips</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to be able to find them online at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I love these clips.  </li>
      <li>Favorite hair clip.</li>
      <li>The springs in them are really strong and held my hair better than a hair tie.</li>
      <li>It is a quick hairstyle that looks nice for her and stays out all day.</li>
      <li>#34;I wish I could wear those, they look so nice in your hair.&amp;#34; I laughed because they&#x27;re a necessity for my thick hair, but it&#x27;s nice to know they look good.</li>
      <li>and I love to wrap my hair up in a bun and secure with one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good price, shipped fast.</li>
      <li>I hoped to have any easy way to put my hair up this summer.</li>
      <li>but they break so dang easy.</li>
      <li>They are so easy to use</li>
      <li>These things are HUGE.  </li>
      <li>I thought that was so great that I wore the tortoiseshell colored clip the next day</li>
      <li>These are a waste of money and so HUGE!!!!!</li>
      <li>I would not purchase this cheaply made product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are WONDERFUL and one of the few (I have tried them all I swear!)</li>
      <li>They will be great if you have very long hair, and a LOT of it.  </li>
      <li>I would have liked some that are a bit bigger so they can hold more.</li>
      <li>It is not a problem with the gripping material but rather the large size.</li>
      <li>Most of the large ones look like something from the 80&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good quality.  </li>
      <li>; And I was right!</li>
      <li>plus the price was right!</li>
      <li>Holds my thick hair great!!!</li>
      <li>Loved them, until it broke after several weeks.</li>
      <li>These are the perfect clip for thick hair.  </li>
      <li>but they&#x27;re fine for now and would be great for those with thinner hair or hair that is a little shorter.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re like me and break hair clips every other week, this is a great value.</li>
      <li>This is the best clip ever for really thick hair!  </li>
      <li>I have ordered multiple to have handy.</li>
      <li>These extra-large octopus clips with no-slip grips (that part is very important - the clips with just plastic teeth don&#x27;t stay in my hair correctly) are perfect, but they&#x27;re very difficult to find in drugstores like Walgreens or CVS, or stores like Target, Meijer, etc.</li>
      <li>Sturdy and priced right.</li>
      <li>They have no teeth inside the clips so the hair just slips right out.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However I would highly recommend these, as they do hold the hair securely.</li>
      <li>but they are very large.  </li>
      <li>Great product but only gets 2 stars becuase even though it says a set of 3 I only received 2 clips.</li>
      <li>and it holds pretty well.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried these octopus clips and I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
      <li>I have thick hair and these work great and</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Exactly as shown.</li>
      <li>Perfect for my long hair that hangs past my shoulder blades.</li>
      <li>Good to buy several of them together so that you will have extra.</li>
      <li>The wings where you open it are flat, which is good.  </li>
      <li>Also the flat side of the clip is really relaxing against the scalp where the traditional shaped ones press against your scalp and don&#x27;t feel good after a while</li>
      <li>Apparently they look nice enough to aspire to, as I&#x27;ve had a friend sigh at one of these in my car, &amp;</li>
      <li>Overall, they are well made and sturdy &amp; look like they&#x27;ll do a good job once my hair gets long.  </li>
      <li>The plastic appears to be molded the same, the rubber grips all seem to be in place, and the spring seems to be as strong as the others, but it just does not stay in place as well.</li>
      <li>thought it was a large spider!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but these were still too large.</li>
      <li>I have very long and thick hair, these clips work great!</li>
      <li>The third clip stays in place fine.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s difficult to find large clips and many times when you do, they&#x27;re way too bulky to still look nice.  </li>
      <li>one of the clips broke today as I attempted to gently remove it from my hair.  </li>
      <li>Holds hair very well without pulling.</li>
      <li>It was like receiving one free when comparing it to our local drug store&#x27;s prices.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>and I absolutely swear by these.</li>
      <li>I just wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t rip my hair the way elastics do, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much for something so very temporary.</li>
      <li>The bottom of the teeth are slightly curved, which makes them very comfortable to wear all day long.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Others stick off against your head too far, but these settle at a nice height so that you can actually sit back against a chair.</li>
      <li>Holds my hair great, but the long teeth mean using a good grip to open it wide enough.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Decent quality.</li>
      <li>If you have really long, thick hair, these are great.  </li>
      <li>The exact clip I need for my very long hair during the hot California summer.</li>
      <li>They worked wonderfully until they broke, and all three were broken after less than two months of use.</li>
      <li>Usually these large clips run around $5 a piece at the drug store or walmart, so its like getting one free when you buy 3 here on amazon.</li>
      <li>I have shoulder length thick, but very fine hair -</li>
      <li>They always break in the same spot, and I do wish they were a little more sturdy, but I keep buying them because they keep my hair up all day.</li>
      <li>Large clips hold my long hair.</li>
      <li>My hair stays in place all day long and it looks very professional.</li>

    <li> My daughter is very pleased with these clips.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and these work great and plus the price was right!</li>
    <li> I buy these over-and-over again. They last a few months before they break. They always break in the same spot, and I do wish they were a little more sturdy, but I keep buying them because they keep my hair up all day.</li>
    <li> Loved them, until it broke after several weeks. Good to buy several of them together so that you will have extra.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and priced right.</li>
    <li> These clips are great! This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried these octopus clips and I&#x27;m hooked. They hold my hair in place without slipping no they don&#x27;t poke into the scalp like a lot of other clips do.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my long hair that hangs past my shoulder blades.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, very long hair and I absolutely swear by these. They are WONDERFUL and one of the few (I have tried them all I swear!) that actually hold my hair up.  I still have to re do the bun every once in awhile, but compared to the alternative, these are a god send!</li>
    <li> This clip is ok.  I think it would work better on curly hair.  Mine&#x27;s straight, and the spring just doesn&#x27;t hold it tight enough.</li>
    <li> These are a waste of money and so HUGE!!!!! They have no teeth inside the clips so the hair just slips right out. I&#x27;m returning mine today.</li>
    <li> Holds hair very well without pulling. Not too heavy.</li>
    <li> I owned one of these clips 9 years ago (It lasted until just a couple months ago). I had relatively thick hair that was halfway down my back. I was able to twist my hair up and into these clips with no problem. The springs in them are really strong and held my hair better than a hair tie. That is not the case any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clips are nothing like the ones they made years ago. They are lighter material and the springs have half of the resistance of the ones I owned previously. It will hold my hair, which is just past my shoulders now, but any jostling movement (like jogging/brisk walking, walking up stairs), causes the clip, with my hair still in it, to gradually slide down my head. Which of course causes me to have to re-wrap my hair back up. I never had that problem before. The quality of these clips have definitely deteriorated over the years.</li>
    <li> I have long hair (maybe a tad longer than waist-length) that is thick (read: a lot of hair) and these work pretty well. They hold the hair but they don&#x27;t get all of it. I would have liked some that are a bit bigger so they can hold more. I like that they are flatter than the regular claw clips so they don&#x27;t hit my headrest when I&#x27;m driving. I will likely look for something different when these wear out but they&#x27;re fine for now and would be great for those with thinner hair or hair that is a little shorter.</li>
    <li> I have hair almost to my waist (yes way too long) and it holds pretty well. Once I get some cut, it will be perfect. It is hard to find clips that will work with long hair. This is one of the one that do.</li>
    <li> perfect for a nice hold that doesn&#x27;t strain your hair, and doesn&#x27;t give you a headache if you have long hair. Also the flat side of the clip is really relaxing against the scalp where the traditional shaped ones press against your scalp and don&#x27;t feel good after a while</li>
    <li> a lot bigger than they look in the picture</li>
    <li> Update: one of the clips broke today as I attempted to gently remove it from my hair.  The plastic holes that hold the metal hinge pin both cracked open reflecting very poor quality.  I have only used the clip a few times.  It is past the return window so I cannot get a refund or replacement.  Very disappointing.  I would not purchase this cheaply made product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These work well overall but they are very large.  I have medium length hair (maybe 3 inches below my shoulders) and sometimes I need to readjust the clip to keep it from falling out.  It is not a problem with the gripping material but rather the large size.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length thick, but very fine hair - these clips are great! No spray required to keep hair in place. The clips hold hair up all day.</li>
    <li> Good price, shipped fast. All good. I love these clips. I have a ton of long hair and they are the only type that work for me.</li>
    <li> The first day that I got these I put one in my hair and it stayed in place even with me working outside and being fairly active.  I thought that was so great that I wore the tortoiseshell colored clip the next day and it wouldn&#x27;t stay in place for long at all.  The third clip stays in place fine.  So far I have been unable to determine what is different about the tortoiseshell colored clip.  The plastic appears to be molded the same, the rubber grips all seem to be in place, and the spring seems to be as strong as the others, but it just does not stay in place as well.</li>
    <li> Exactly as shown. Large clips hold my long hair. The &#x27;no-slip grip&#x27; does pull my hair some if I am not careful removing the clips, but they definitely do not slide anywhere. The Octopus clips are the only clips that work to hold my hair up and off my shoulders without having to reposition the clip repeatedly. Decent quality.</li>
    <li> Holds my hair great, but the long teeth mean using a good grip to open it wide enough.&lt;br /&gt;Great value, built well, not a cheap clip</li>
    <li> I love this clip. I have ordered multiple to have handy. Hold my thick hair without pulling</li>
    <li> Just as described. I have thick hair just past my shoulders and I love to wrap my hair up in a bun and secure with one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do notice I get a headache after wearing these for 5 or so hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a fan of the mixed brown color clip..I have on several occasions thought it was a large spider!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I would highly recommend these, as they do hold the hair securely.</li>
    <li> I have about two and a half feet of very thick hair, and it&#x27;s near-impossible to find a clip that will keep it all in place. These extra-large octopus clips with no-slip grips (that part is very important - the clips with just plastic teeth don&#x27;t stay in my hair correctly) are perfect, but they&#x27;re very difficult to find in drugstores like Walgreens or CVS, or stores like Target, Meijer, etc. It&#x27;s great to be able to find them online at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Great on shipping and product</li>
    <li> It performs as described. I have thick, heavy hair and it keeps my hair up. I don&#x27;t feel like it will break with repeated use.</li>
    <li> I use these until they break... so getting a set of three at once was a great idea.</li>
    <li> Great product but only gets 2 stars becuase even though it says a set of 3 I only received 2 clips.</li>
    <li> Perfect! The exact clip I need for my very long hair during the hot California summer. My hair stays in place all day long and it looks very professional. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have very long and thick hair, these clips work great!</li>
    <li> Favorite hair clip. Doesn&#x27;t pull or weigh down my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also a good price.</li>
    <li> This is the best clip ever for really thick hair!  It&#x27;s the only thing I can use and it keeps my hair in place all day.  Love them!</li>
    <li> I really love using these, I have thick hair and normally its hard to keep it all up but these do the job! The one down side is that they keep breaking!</li>
    <li> They worked wonderfully until they broke, and all three were broken after less than two months of use. I just wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t rip my hair the way elastics do, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much for something so very temporary.</li>
    <li> The clips are great - if you do not  have too much hair. I have very thick hair that hangs about half way down my back. I hoped to have any easy way to put my hair up this summer. I read one review that said it worked for her thick, waist length hair so I hoped it would work for me. They work great on my daughter (with thinner hair). It is a quick hairstyle that looks nice for her and stays out all day. However, it will not fit around my hair when it is wrapped up. I gave them 4 stars because the product is great. If the clips were big enough to work for me, I would give them 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have really thick, course hair but these were still too large. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> I love these but they break so dang easy. This was a good deal though. I get one at the store for 8$! I recommend them but I go through so many! :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy that I checked out amazon for these great clips!  It was like receiving one free when comparing it to our local drug store&#x27;s prices.&lt;br /&gt; I have super thick hair and it&#x27;s below my shoulders.  These are the perfect clip for thick hair.  They are so easy to use and they are the quickest way I know how to get all of my hair up and off of my neck!</li>
    <li> These are the best. I have thick thick long hair, and these clips distribute the weight of it nicely. Others stick off against your head too far, but these settle at a nice height so that you can actually sit back against a chair. They&#x27;re also a nice width, and the tiger-stripey color looks very attractive in wheat-blonde hair. Apparently they look nice enough to aspire to, as I&#x27;ve had a friend sigh at one of these in my car, &amp;#34;I wish I could wear those, they look so nice in your hair.&amp;#34; I laughed because they&#x27;re a necessity for my thick hair, but it&#x27;s nice to know they look good. If you need these, buy this kind. The bottom of the teeth are slightly curved, which makes them very comfortable to wear all day long.&lt;br /&gt;If your hair isn&#x27;t thick, these will be too big for you- there&#x27;s an inch and a half inside from the teeth to the clasp. But if it is, they are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;And you can&#x27;t beat the price for three on Amazon.</li>
    <li> These clips are awesome but huge.  I expected the smaller size.  They are almost as big as my fist.  The do hold up my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair perfectly though!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this clip. I have had one for years until I broke it shutting my vanity drawer the other day.&lt;br /&gt;I went to the drug store where I had previously bought it and the price had skyrocketed.&lt;br /&gt;I said to myself, &amp;#34;I know I can do better than this at Amazon.&amp;#34; And I was right! And now I have 3 of my favorite clips and I can&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;This clip keeps my hair up all day and its as if it isn&#x27;t in your hair. There is no pain or discomfort at all. It is the &amp;#34;Perfect Clip.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Holds my thick hair great!!! Well made!</li>
    <li> I love these clips.  I have waste-length hair and need larger clips to hold it all in a twist.  It&#x27;s difficult to find large clips and many times when you do, they&#x27;re way too bulky to still look nice.  Most of the large ones look like something from the 80&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good quality.  Absolutely no complaints.  And the price on this set is very, very good - especially when compared to what you would pay in a beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> These things are HUGE.  They will be great if you have very long hair, and a LOT of it.  My hair is just growing out from being very short, so it&#x27;s going to be long, long time until I can use these.  I wanted something a little smaller, and the description didn&#x27;t really show how big these things are.  They are just over 3&amp;#34; long, almost 2&amp;#34; wide and at least 1.5&amp;#34; to 2&amp;#34; deep.  The wings where you open it are flat, which is good.  Overall, they are well made and sturdy &amp; look like they&#x27;ll do a good job once my hair gets long.  If you have really long, thick hair, these are great.  If you&#x27;re intermediate or thin hair, you may want something a little smaller.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me and break hair clips every other week, this is a great value. Usually these large clips run around $5 a piece at the drug store or walmart, so its like getting one free when you buy 3 here on amazon. The quality is obviously not top notch, since they do tend to snap or crack for me. But these are the only clips I can find that can accommodate my long hair (goes to my lower back) so i put up with the quality.</li>
