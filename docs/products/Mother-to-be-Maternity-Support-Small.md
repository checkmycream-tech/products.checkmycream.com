      <li>as well it feels great!</li>
      <li>Excellent support!  </li>
      <li>This belt provides great support but doesn&#x27;t hide well under clothes.  </li>
      <li>It is great for walking for doing errands around the house.</li>
      <li>I am so happy with it, and wish I had bought it sooner...</li>
      <li>This belt provides good support for prenatal sciatica.</li>
      <li>just in a good day) &lt;br</li>
      <li>then you get good at it..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of like a bra -</li>
      <li>It comes with easy-to-read and understand instructions with pictures and a nice disclaimer about how it doesn&#x27;t constrict bloodflow, etc.</li>
      <li>It was amazing how supportive for being lightweight.</li>
      <li>It is very comfortable when I am standing or walking.  </li>
      <li>I can guarantee that I would not be able to work if I did not have this brace.  </li>
      <li>I was able to work all of my shifts up until I delivered.  </li>
      <li>also don&#x27;t wear the top strap that goes on the top of the stomach</li>
      <li>I also find that I can wear it with our without a tank top beneath - it doesn&#x27;t rub or itch.</li>
      <li>Wish it came in a more neutral color.  </li>
      <li>From the day I started using it many of my pains subsided or dissappeared.  </li>
      <li>This product is really good, right now i&#x27;m and the ending of my 7th month</li>
      <li>Wish it would have been more comfortable.</li>
      <li>I was able to enjoy my vacation after this and could even do some hikes and longer walks without paying for it</li>
      <li>know some people have said this is pretty bulky, but honestly I don&#x27;t think it is.</li>
      <li>I wear it under t-shirts just fine.  </li>
      <li>it seemed to be an &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; fit.</li>
      <li>It is a really comfortable belt that keeps your belly up preventing backache.</li>
      <li>As of this time, I enjoy using it because my back feels good, I can use it under my work clothes and it is so easy to don.  </li>
      <li>The small fits perfect for me.</li>
      <li>I just went for a 3 miles walk (ok, it was a bit much, but 2 miles felt fine).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true to size.      </li>
      <li>And that&#x27;s the longest (by far) that I have been able to walk since I was about 3-4 months pregnant!</li>
      <li>I would use it again if l was pregnant.</li>
      <li>I have worn this ALL the time since about 7 months pregnant.  </li>
      <li>I am pregnant with twins and work as an orthopedic surgical nurse.  </li>
      <li>knew I had to find something to get by with work, life, and enjoying my 2 year old!</li>
      <li>Probably won&#x27;t work for yoga and pilates, but I continued to wear it for a few hours after my workout and felt great.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve just grown used to not wearing it), though some women might find it useful.</li>
      <li>I do not know if it will continue to be effective when I get further along.</li>
      <li>I wish I could get by with something more lightweight, but since I cannot, the benefits of this band far outweigh the nuisance of it.</li>
      <li>and i started having femoral nerve pain in my right leg with pins/needle feeling, stiffness, achiness, and a burning sensation as well with standing and walking.</li>
      <li>With its new design it makes it easy for you to adjust the belt without any pressure on your belly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quite bulky and thick, which I&#x27;ll gladly deal with over the alternative, but if you are just looking for something lightly supportive that looks smooth under clothes, buy something else.</li>
      <li>28 weeks pregnant, I was in tears because I was in so much pain.</li>
      <li>It was also to hot for me to use it.</li>
      <li>When I first got it (I was about 25 weeks along or so?)</li>
      <li>This product does exactly what it says it does.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of bulky and not very comfortable, but well worth it.</li>
      <li>you have very sensitive skin, I recommend wearing a soft t-shirt or tank top tucked inside the belt.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t wear it much just because it didn&#x27;t feel right.</li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t think I would have made it to my due date without it.  </li>
      <li>Not only has the belt helped to improve the pain in my leg, it has also allowed me to be able to walk or stand for 2 hours + without feeling much discomfort.  </li>
      <li>Too cumbersome and difficulty to get on and off for pregnant ladies who go to the bathroom frequently!  </li>
      <li>If you are having trouble continuing with an exercise program such as jogging or walking this is a great solution that may help you continue for a while longer.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I can wear it under my shirts and not have to worry too much about people noticing it.</li>
      <li>Then once I started to really pop (+28 weeks), this brace has been a life saver.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>:) My mom suggested putting really soft kleenexes along the seams, which actually worked really well to increase the comfort of the belt against my skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Really it just depends on if you like it or not to wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But At whole this works</li>
      <li>/&gt;Since I wear it every day, I notice that I get really itchy from the material.</li>
      <li>you might see it beneath very lightweight clothing.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>This belt is made well and really helped me out.</li>
      <li>too many pieces and parts, not fun to wear</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wearing that belt for a week and a half, and most of the pain is gone.</li>
      <li>Wouldn&#x27;t have been able to do aerobics (power walking/light jogging) without it in my 2nd and 3rd trimesters.</li>
      <li>belt is on my list of must-have things anyone I know who&#x27;s pregnant and having back or sciatica issues.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Anyway, I highly recommend this band to anyone suffering from this sort of discomfort.</li>
      <li>My back and hips feel a LOT better (not completely painless, but that&#x27;s pregnancy...)</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t walk for more than a few blocks....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as user friendly as I expected.  </li>
      <li>I feel you should only wear it when your back hurts, because when I put it on when I&#x27;m ok, my back then starts to hurt.</li>
      <li>I had used a similar brace during my first pregnancy 4 yrs ago</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this belt; it took a very miserable pregnancy and made it much more enjoyable.</li>
      <li>But given that I&#x27;ve had a winter pregnancy and the long tanks were readily available from several stores, this proved no problem for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It really helps take the strain off my back and hips.  </li>
      <li>I am 26 weeks pregnant with my first baby and not too big yet, but jogging caused a lot of round ligament pain.</li>
      <li>, I guess it&#x27;s ok if you don&#x27;t have to use the restroom every 5 minutes (you know what I mean).  </li>
      <li>I am 7 months pregnant, and I have been suffering for about 3 months of back pain, plus my hips are too loose and hurt, my belly was hurting quite a bit too, trying to carry the weight of my baby and</li>
      <li>It did help, but I used it without the strap above the belly because I carried my daughter high</li>
      <li>Fit is also a little big.</li>
      <li>I took it off to sleep, put it back on this morning, and now the pain is completely gone!</li>
      <li>I thought this will not really live up to what its advertisement says because it looks so compact and priced cheaply than the other maternity supports, but it has prevented me from having back pains.  </li>
      <li>I began having sciatic pain, back pain and lower abdominal pressure early on in my pregnancy (at around 3mths).  </li>
      <li>I am in my 7th month of pregnancy, and about two weeks ago I started having the most excruciating pain in my extreme lower back (down by my sacrum and radiating to the left part of my pelvic bone).</li>
      <li>Other than some minor complaints, I say this was worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>I bought the medium, but probably could have gotten the small because of the wide range of adjustment available.</li>
      <li>It also was a bit irritating if I wore it on my skin, so I would wear it over my pants, which allowed me to loosen it easily.  </li>

<li> I am sure that this misalignment contributed to my pregnancy back pain, and I was afraid that since that was the case I might just have to suffer through it.</li>
<li> that slightly misaligned my upper back, so that very occasionally I have pain in my neck.</li>
<li> only downside I can see (and it&#x27;s not really much of one, IMO)</li>
<li> The bottom part works well alone for me, but when I put the entire back part on, it digs into my hips when I sit down.</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t consider being on my feet for long or going for a walk without it!  </li>
<li> Last thing the color, it&#x27;s only in white and that sucks at times.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering back pain since the beging of the pregnancy. When I use i feel the support, helps a lot but if you have to sit down is very uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> For some reason, I thought this would be a nude color (as it looked in the photo), but it&#x27;s actually white.  Wish it came in a more neutral color.  In any case, it did help with my back pains as my belly grew bigger.  I had to loosen the belt when I sat down since I didn&#x27;t need the support and it was a bit tight.  But when I walked around, I would tighten it.  It&#x27;s true to size.      The downside is that the care instructions say to hand wash instead of machine wash.  It also was a bit irritating if I wore it on my skin, so I would wear it over my pants, which allowed me to loosen it easily.  Other than some minor complaints, I say this was worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> This belt provides good support for prenatal sciatica. It lifts the belly and straightens your hips and back to correct posture.  I recommend.  It has helped me!</li>
    <li> I thought this will not really live up to what its advertisement says because it looks so compact and priced cheaply than the other maternity supports, but it has prevented me from having back pains.  I am only 18 weeks along, but I have a physically demanding job.  I do not know if it will continue to be effective when I get further along. As of this time, I enjoy using it because my back feels good, I can use it under my work clothes and it is so easy to don.  I can feel the difference in how my back feels if I do not wear it.</li>
    <li> It is a really comfortable belt that keeps your belly up preventing backache. I haven&#x27;t seen any belt before like this. With its new design it makes it easy for you to adjust the belt without any pressure on your belly. Overall I recommend it to the buyers. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This product is really good, right now i&#x27;m and the ending of my 7th month and i&#x27;ve used this about 3 to 4 times. I feel you should only wear it when your back hurts, because when I put it on when I&#x27;m ok, my back then starts to hurt. Another thing is, my baby hates it! She starts kicking and moving around I guess at times it may feel tight but if I loosen it, it then does nothing for my back! Last thing the color, it&#x27;s only in white and that sucks at times. But At whole this works and I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I am pregnant with twins and work as an orthopedic surgical nurse.  I began having sciatic pain, back pain and lower abdominal pressure early on in my pregnancy (at around 3mths).  I had used a similar brace during my first pregnancy 4 yrs ago and it had helped.  This brace has been a god send.  It gives my body the added support I need in order to perform my demanding job.  It has also helped with the added pains and pressures with having twins and growing at an accelerated pace.  From the day I started using it many of my pains subsided or dissappeared.  I can guarantee that I would not be able to work if I did not have this brace.  D. Giusti, San Diego, CA 10/12/08</li>
    <li> I just received this last week and it will allow me to keep running longer - thank goodness! I am 26 weeks pregnant with my first baby and not too big yet, but jogging caused a lot of round ligament pain. I have been a runner for years and continued with my 4 mile runs until about 21 weeks when it became too uncomfortable because of ligament pain. Then cut it down to a 2 mile run and 2 mile walk, but at about 24 weeks the pain was back. I used the Mother-to-be support this week and no pain at all! It was amazing how supportive for being lightweight. I also used it while I did lunges and squats and it didn&#x27;t impede leg movement while bending and stretching. Probably won&#x27;t work for yoga and pilates, but I continued to wear it for a few hours after my workout and felt great. Initially, I was VERY skeptical that this would work. If you are having trouble continuing with an exercise program such as jogging or walking this is a great solution that may help you continue for a while longer. I definitely plan to use it when I quit running and switch to walking.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this belt; it took a very miserable pregnancy and made it much more enjoyable. Fewer cramps, less back pain, NO swelling in my feet. A must have.</li>
    <li> Excellent support!  Wouldn&#x27;t have been able to do aerobics (power walking/light jogging) without it in my 2nd and 3rd trimesters.</li>
    <li> My wife didn&#x27;t like this, not very soft material and very rigid back which makes it difficult to sit down while wearing it.</li>
    <li> I could not sit while wearing this because it dug in. It was also to hot for me to use it. Wish it would have been more comfortable.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have had this belt for my last two pregnancies!  I am in my last 2 months of pregnancy and bought this belt to help with some sciatic nerve pain in my leg.  Not only has the belt helped to improve the pain in my leg, it has also allowed me to be able to walk or stand for 2 hours + without feeling much discomfort.  I would definately recommend it.</li>
    <li> This belt is made well and really helped me out. I was having pain from my round ligament and this helped to keep that pain from coming as long as i was wearing it. It&#x27;s kind of bulky and not very comfortable, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this particular belt because of the reviews, plus my local Babies-R-Us didn&#x27;t have a size small support belt in stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This belt has turned out to be one of the few lifesavers for my pregnancy -- my sciatica was horrid from month five on, really, and this was the ONLY thing that relieved it. It comes with easy-to-read and understand instructions with pictures and a nice disclaimer about how it doesn&#x27;t constrict bloodflow, etc. (And it doesn&#x27;t.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to wear the upper strap part (it would slide down a little when I was smaller and I&#x27;ve just grown used to not wearing it), though some women might find it useful. I saved mine just in case but have yet to wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I can see (and it&#x27;s not really much of one, IMO) is you might have to buy some really long, thin tank tops or long john style shirts to wear under the belt, as it could irritate your skin otherwise. But given that I&#x27;ve had a winter pregnancy and the long tanks were readily available from several stores, this proved no problem for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This belt is on my list of must-have things anyone I know who&#x27;s pregnant and having back or sciatica issues. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Worked well to eliviate my back pain. I would definitely recommend to others who need a little support. It also hides well under my clothes. The small fits perfect for me. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;6 &amp; 115 lbs pre-pregnancy.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 28 weeks pregnant, I was in tears because I was in so much pain. I purchased this belt and had it overnighted to me while on vacation. Prior to using this belt, every step I took hurt me with pain radiating down my leg and sharp twinges shooting through my hip joint. I had tried massage, ice, exercises, stretches, chiropractic, and just staying off of my feet as much as possible, but nothing worked until this. My pain subsided within just half a day of wearing it. I was able to enjoy my vacation after this and could even do some hikes and longer walks without paying for it later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I go several hours without wearing it I can start to feel the pain coming back. When I put it on, the pain goes away. I&#x27;m so thankful for having discovered this remedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have very sensitive skin, I recommend wearing a soft t-shirt or tank top tucked inside the belt. When worn right against the skin, which I have done for several days, the seams can get a little picky, but not too bad at all. For me, it&#x27;s tolerable. The only improvement to this item I would recommend would be for it to have breathable fleece against the skin. :) My mom suggested putting really soft kleenexes along the seams, which actually worked really well to increase the comfort of the belt against my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hand washable and adjustable, so it can grow with you. I bought the medium, but probably could have gotten the small because of the wide range of adjustment available. My pre-pregnancy weight was about 130 and my current weight is 155 at 30.5 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;Nicole</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says it does. I am in my 7th month of pregnancy, and about two weeks ago I started having the most excruciating pain in my extreme lower back (down by my sacrum and radiating to the left part of my pelvic bone). It felt like all the bones there were just grinding against each other, and I could hardly walk or lift myself up from lying down.    I had was in a car accident years ago that slightly misaligned my upper back, so that very occasionally I have pain in my neck. I am sure that this misalignment contributed to my pregnancy back pain, and I was afraid that since that was the case I might just have to suffer through it. But I got this product in the mail yesterday, put it on, and the pain subsided a bit throughout the day. I took it off to sleep, put it back on this morning, and now the pain is completely gone! I can&#x27;t believe it.    Anyway, I highly recommend this band to anyone suffering from this sort of discomfort. Take note, however, that this is a serious, heavy duty maternity band. I would not suggest you buy it if you don&#x27;t have back pain. It&#x27;s quite bulky and thick, which I&#x27;ll gladly deal with over the alternative, but if you are just looking for something lightly supportive that looks smooth under clothes, buy something else. I wish I could get by with something more lightweight, but since I cannot, the benefits of this band far outweigh the nuisance of it.</li>
    <li> Too cumbersome and difficulty to get on and off for pregnant ladies who go to the bathroom frequently!  Provides minimal-moderate support.</li>
    <li> The wife says it worked but the baby did not like it. She say baby moved around and kicked while on.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as user friendly as I expected.  It&#x27;s a pain to have to adjust it every time I get up from a chair, b/c it rises up when I sit.  I did not count the fact there are 3 pcs, so every time you use the restroom, you have to take them apart then put them back together, I guess it&#x27;s ok if you don&#x27;t have to use the restroom every 5 minutes (you know what I mean).  It is very comfortable when I am standing or walking.  Unfortunately, still doesn&#x27;t not ease my SI pain, but it does give me some support.</li>
    <li> This product is just as described. I am 7 months pregnant, and I have been suffering for about 3 months of back pain, plus my hips are too loose and hurt, my belly was hurting quite a bit too, trying to carry the weight of my baby and there wasn&#x27;t must I could do. I couldn&#x27;t walk for more than a few blocks....(less than 10 at a time, and ten was a lot... just in a good day) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wearing that belt for a week and a half, and most of the pain is gone. My back and hips feel a LOT better (not completely painless, but that&#x27;s pregnancy...) and my belly doesn&#x27;t hurt! I just went for a 3 miles walk (ok, it was a bit much, but 2 miles felt fine). And that&#x27;s the longest (by far) that I have been able to walk since I was about 3-4 months pregnant! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I recommand this product to any woman who suffers like it did. I am so happy with it, and wish I had bought it sooner...</li>
    <li> I used this for my last trimester when my belly was affecting my back. It did help, but I used it without the strap above the belly because I carried my daughter high and it was uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> I got this a couple months ago and decided to wear it a while before I posted a review. When I first got it (I was about 25 weeks along or so?) it seemed to be an &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; fit. I didn&#x27;t wear it much just because it didn&#x27;t feel right. Really it was because I was still too small for it to do it&#x27;s job. Then once I started to really pop (+28 weeks), this brace has been a life saver. I&#x27;m carrying all in the front so my stomach hangs, then it starts to hurt pretty bad. If I don&#x27;t wear this brace for the majority of the day, you bet I would be laying/sitting down all the time!!! I&#x27;m 33 weeks now and plan on wearing this every day till I deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I wear it every day, I notice that I get really itchy from the material. What I ended up doing was getting the Baby Be Mine Maternity Belly Band and wearing it under the brace. That is actually meant to keep your pants up, but I use it specifically for this brace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know some people have said this is pretty bulky, but honestly I don&#x27;t think it is. I can wear it under my shirts and not have to worry too much about people noticing it. only time they notice is if they see the bottom of the brace poking out from the bottom of my shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t wear the top strap that goes on the top of the stomach, I just find it a bit useless. Really it just depends on if you like it or not to wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely recommend this to family and friends!!!</li>
    <li> This belt provides great support but doesn&#x27;t hide well under clothes.  It is great for walking for doing errands around the house.</li>
    <li> I bought this support because I had excrutiating pelvic pain during my pregnancy. I bought this but it didn&#x27;t help one bit. Fit is also a little big.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this is a lot more bulky then I was hoping for, it does provide some support but I find it more uncomfortable than anything.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with my stomach bra for pregnancy. I used it everyday for 9 months and it held up very well.I would use it again if l was pregnant.</li>
    <li> this maternity support is the best of there kinds that are out there in the world! with 2 small children at home and #3 on the way i had already tryed the other kids of supports and belts THEY DIDNT work so we found this one and i thought i should try it.. I am going to use it after baby as well it feels great! helps with my feet hurting my lower back hurting my upper back and my sholders as well the only adjustment is when you are needing to sit down and get up its not very easy at all.. you have a adjust and get used to it then you get good at it..</li>
    <li> The bottom part works well alone for me, but when I put the entire back part on, it digs into my hips when I sit down. So, it was kinda uncomfortable. I have an office job, so I sit all day. Therefore, I didn&#x27;t get to wear it that much at work because it was uncomfortable. However, sometimes when I put it on at home and lay down, it did relieve some of my back pain.</li>
    <li> I am a part time registered nurse and i started having femoral nerve pain in my right leg with pins/needle feeling, stiffness, achiness, and a burning sensation as well with standing and walking. All this started at 16 weeks pregnant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew I had to find something to get by with work, life, and enjoying my 2 year old! This binder is AWESOME!! 90% of my pain is gone, and I wear this binder all day except with bathing and sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the buy!</li>
    <li> I have worn this ALL the time since about 7 months pregnant.  I&#x27;m due any day now &amp; still wearing it.  It really helps take the strain off my back and hips.  I wouldn&#x27;t consider being on my feet for long or going for a walk without it!  It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;sheer&amp;#34; under clothes, but it&#x27;s not bulky either - I wear it under t-shirts just fine.  It&#x27;s kind of like a bra - you might see it beneath very lightweight clothing.  I also find that I can wear it with our without a tank top beneath - it doesn&#x27;t rub or itch.</li>
    <li> This is the most uncomfortable contraption I have ever come across. It did not help with my back pain either!</li>
    <li> too many pieces and parts, not fun to wear</li>
    <li> This was the second support band that I bought during my pregnancy.  I was experiencing pelvic girdle pain. I work on my feet as a nurse, so my mobility was hindered by the severe pain.  The first band I bought was pretty much useless and caused me bruising to my abdoment.  The Mother-to-be Maternity band was a lifesaver!  I honestly don&#x27;t think I would have made it to my due date without it.  I was able to work all of my shifts up until I delivered.  Highly recommended!</li>
