      <li>best results, use the strips after your face has been waxed.</li>
      <li>great  product and i like the scent of tea tree</li>
      <li>Great nose strips.  </li>

      <li>Good to have it out, also yes.  </li>

      <li>I find they work best if I use one right after a shower.</li>
      <li>I LOVE these!</li>
      <li>This product is amazing.</li>
      <li>Steaming and a gentle once over with a good clean comodone remover is still the best way to accomplish pore cleaning.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t have to though, but it proved more efficient for me.</li>
      <li>You must peel of the plastic and then put the side that was touching the plastic on your moistened nose.</li>
      <li>I love seeing everything that they remove.</li>
      <li>power and I felt they did an even better job than biore.  </li>
      <li>you won&#x27;t regret it and you&#x27;ll save 5% :)</li>
      <li>I used to always use biore, but these work better than even their \\&quot;ultra\\&quot; strips.</li>
      <li>I bought these on a whim and found that i got better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just be sure to follow the instructions on the back of the pack to have the best results.</li>
      <li>I LOVE these pore strips.</li>
      <li>Make sure you leave no longer than 20 minutes though.</li>
      <li>Thumbs up as always to Amazon for giving us choices, for letting people right honest reviews, and for finding creative ways to avoid shipping costs.</li>
      <li>Feels good and works really well.</li>
      <li>and I can honestly say it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
      <li>Another plus is I&#x27;m pretty sure these come out to be cheaper!</li>
      <li>but I have been switching every product I use to be vegan and cruelty free.</li>
      <li>Another plus is that they work well on the whole face, and not just the nose; just cut to fit! :)</li>
      <li>These work just as well and are pretty cheap for 30 strips!</li>
      <li>I originally bought this product because I wanted nose strips</li>
      <li>, I got a lot of pimples on my nose even after applying astringent to try to close the pores and benzoyl peroxide to keep them clean.</li>
      <li>/&gt;BUT, overall, this product does smell nice, does a decent job, and is a good price.</li>
      <li>I read some reviews prior to buying them, but they were not as good as I hoped.</li>
      <li>With biore I had to steam my face, scrub it, then apply the strips to get the full effect.</li>
      <li>These work really good, and are cheaper than most other brands!</li>
      <li>The strips clean my nose very well!</li>
      <li>place this on my nose right after I</li>
      <li>These are wonderful plain and simple.</li>
      <li>It really has effect!</li>
      <li>Works exactly as it says.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t dry your face, just put it right on. :)</li>
      <li>That being said they pretty much do what you expect them to.</li>
      <li>This item has done absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
      <li>but I like to add the extra step of lightly scrubbing the nose</li>
      <li>I often cut the strip in different sections to better fit my trouble areas.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it cleans as well as other brands, but it does a great job, and it less pricy.  </li>
      <li>That usually gives me enough parts to clean either more than just the nose area or two cleaning of the pores in the nose area.  </li>
      <li>Well, to be fair I am not impressed with the Biore face strips either, but these pretty much just ripped out some face fuzz and left the clogged pores undisturbed.</li>
      <li>The first time you use it, you might just end up pulling the tiny hairs off your nose, forehead, or wherever you&#x27;re using it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, what I do is wet my nose, apply the strip, and then apply extra water on top of the strip so that the whole strip is quite wet.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if much stuff gets pulled out of my cheeks and forehead, but getting even one blackhead out and preventing a pimple is worth it to me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Oh, and as usual, Amazon shipping was quick and reliable!</li>
      <li>If you feel that its yanking on your skin too much, just put a little warm water under the strip an pull slowly.</li>
      <li>you need to wet your nose with water first.</li>
      <li>I followed all of the directions and when I removed it, my nose was clear of white heads.</li>
      <li>advantage of these could be only a + for me -- there is a bit of clear plastic on all edges of each strip.  </li>
      <li>The directions were clear and the same as biore although I think Earth says to leave it on longer than biore (I could be mistaken about that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>In fact, this one barely pulls out any blackheads if I follow the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have always kind of been obsessed with getting dirt out of my pores.</li>
      <li>The proof of it working will be right on the dried up strip once you pull it off your nose!</li>
      <li>I get massive amounts of black heads on my nose, so much that it looks like a strawberry sometimes (gross i know...)</li>
      <li>I have used the name brand of pore strips for years and, liking to try new things, was influenced by other reviews to give these a try.  </li>

<li> I have used the name brand of pore strips for years and, liking to try new things, was influenced by other reviews to give these a try.  </li>
<li> It takes a little longer for it to dry because of this, but it works really well when I do it this way.</li>
<li> It made the pores on my nose look red and enlarged, which is to be expected after forcefully pulling stuff out of them.</li>
<li> I just put these strips all over my face while still damp from the shower, and after they dry, I peel them off.</li>
<li> The strips did not work for me as well as I expected.</li>
<li> Just be careful-</li>
<li> But when I took the strip off, it left a thick white residue on my skin and did not clean my pores at all.</li>
<li> Be careful!</li>
<li> It may be cheaper than Biore pore strips, but it doesn&#x27;t adhere strong enough to the skin to actually pull out all of those nasty little gunk in the clogged pores.</li>
<li> so your pores are very open, and peel them off very, very slowly after they&#x27;re completely dry.</li>
<li> Sometimes they feel a little uncomfortable or harsh when removing, but I can&#x27;t say if that is typical as I have only tried this brand so far.  </li>
<li> Tears everything off your face except black heads.</li>
<li> I used Biore strips when I was in high school and stopped after a few purchases because they were getting expensive.</li>
<li> The blackheads get pulled out like little blades of grass from my nose and below my lower lip.  </li>
<li> Also they are slightly too small for my manly, beastly nose</li>
<li> Just keep in mind that it wont remove every single blackhead all strips of every brand leave some behind</li>
<li> The reason I give this product a low score is because it makes your nose look horrible right after you use it.</li>
<li> so I have very little experience with this type of product.  </li>
<li> It works as well, if not better, than the Biore strips.</li>
<li> its not a magical strip but does the job im expecting.</li>
<li> Compared to other products, the chemicals used in this seem to be healthier/less unhealthy too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to Biore, this product doesn&#x27;t perform as well for me if I follow both products&#x27; instructions.</li>
<li> If I did all of that with these strips my skin might be raw!</li>
<li> This sucker removes all sorts of things from my face.</li>
<li> If I cut biore ones, some of the cut parts are tough to peal away from the plastic strip -- not these.&lt;br</li>
<li> and my fiance says he sees a dramatic difference.</li>
<li> I would buy Biore strips but always felt bad at the steep price with continuous use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great  product and i like the scent of tea tree</li>
    <li> The strips did not work for me as well as I expected. I read some reviews prior to buying them, but they were not as good as I hoped. After applying them, I waited and followed the instructions. But when I took the strip off, it left a thick white residue on my skin and did not clean my pores at all.</li>
    <li> These pore strips do a great job of pulling junk out. People who complain about them not working probably didn&#x27;t follow directions...you need to wet your nose with water first. The reason I give this product a low score is because it makes your nose look horrible right after you use it. It made the pores on my nose look red and enlarged, which is to be expected after forcefully pulling stuff out of them. Not only that, I got a lot of pimples on my nose even after applying astringent to try to close the pores and benzoyl peroxide to keep them clean. I went through 10 weeks of using one of these strips every week and I can honestly say it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> This item has done absolutely nothing for me.  I have used an entire box in one month with zero effects.  Some people may have good results from this type of item but I have not.  I would not purchase this item again.  I have several boxes left; I will probably give them to my sons to see if they benefit from them.</li>
    <li> I have purchased and used this product.  I don&#x27;t think it cleans as well as other brands, but it does a great job, and it less pricy.  Please note, this product is NOT certified organic, even though the description mentions TWICE that it uses organic tea tree oil. There is no USDA logo stating that this product is organic, so do not buy this if you are looking for something organic.  Also, it contains parabens, which is not mentioned here or on the products website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, overall, this product does smell nice, does a decent job, and is a good price.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this product because I wanted nose strips and I wanted ones offered with the super-saving shipping discount. It took me over 10 minutes to figure out how to peel off the strip from the packaging, but I&#x27;ve never looked back. You must peel of the plastic and then put the side that was touching the plastic on your moistened nose. The strips clean my nose very well!</li>
    <li> its not a magical strip but does the job im expecting. Just keep in mind that it wont remove every single blackhead all strips of every brand leave some behind</li>
    <li> It may be cheaper than Biore pore strips, but it doesn&#x27;t adhere strong enough to the skin to actually pull out all of those nasty little gunk in the clogged pores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the brand name products and the Clari-T strips work just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course these are cheaper than the brand name products.</li>
    <li> They do what they&#x27;re supposed to do, and do a good job at it. Good value, Going to place another order.</li>
    <li> I used Biore strips when I was in high school and stopped after a few purchases because they were getting expensive. These work just as well and are pretty cheap for 30 strips!</li>
    <li> It works as well, if not better, than the Biore strips. I will continue to buy these since they are cheaper and you get 30 strips for the price.</li>
    <li> The first time you use it, you might just end up pulling the tiny hairs off your nose, forehead, or wherever you&#x27;re using it. If you follow up the next day or so, you will get blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results, use the strips after your face has been waxed. Use them after the shower so your pores are very open, and peel them off very, very slowly after they&#x27;re completely dry.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these! I&#x27;ve been using them since 2010. I&#x27;ve even gotten my boyfriend to use it with me :-P Just be sure to follow the instructions on the back of the pack to have the best results. The back of the packet says to just wash your face/nose area but I like to add the extra step of lightly scrubbing the nose are with a facial brush or sponge to expose some of the blackheads/pimples prior to the nose strip. You don&#x27;t have to though, but it proved more efficient for me. The proof of it working will be right on the dried up strip once you pull it off your nose!</li>
    <li> This sucker removes all sorts of things from my face. Apply water liberally before using the strip. I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy i discovered these on amazon! I get massive amounts of black heads on my nose, so much that it looks like a strawberry sometimes (gross i know...) I would buy Biore strips but always felt bad at the steep price with continuous use. I bought these on a whim and found that i got better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and sign up with subscribe and save! you won&#x27;t regret it and you&#x27;ll save 5% :)</li>
    <li> I have used the name brand of pore strips for years and, liking to try new things, was influenced by other reviews to give these a try.  They have a good deal of &amp;#34;sticking&amp;#34; power and I felt they did an even better job than biore.  The directions were clear and the same as biore although I think Earth says to leave it on longer than biore (I could be mistaken about that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One advantage of these could be only a + for me -- there is a bit of clear plastic on all edges of each strip.  I often cut the strip in different sections to better fit my trouble areas.  That usually gives me enough parts to clean either more than just the nose area or two cleaning of the pores in the nose area.  If I cut biore ones, some of the cut parts are tough to peal away from the plastic strip -- not these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these and will buy them again.  Thumbs up as always to Amazon for giving us choices, for letting people right honest reviews, and for finding creative ways to avoid shipping costs.</li>
    <li> Feels good and works really well. It always manages to pull out a ton of blackheads. Compared to other products, the chemicals used in this seem to be healthier/less unhealthy too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to Biore, this product doesn&#x27;t perform as well for me if I follow both products&#x27; instructions. In fact, this one barely pulls out any blackheads if I follow the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, what I do is wet my nose, apply the strip, and then apply extra water on top of the strip so that the whole strip is quite wet. It takes a little longer for it to dry because of this, but it works really well when I do it this way. For those who aren&#x27;t finding this product to be very effective, you might want to give this method a try.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these pore strips. I have always kind of been obsessed with getting dirt out of my pores. I used to use the biore ones but I have been switching every product I use to be vegan and cruelty free. Well thank god these were on amazon. They work just like the biore ones. Another plus is I&#x27;m pretty sure these come out to be cheaper! If I can figure out how to post a picture of the pore strip after I used it I will!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I forgot to add my tip on using them. I find they work best if I use one right after a shower. That way my pores are opened up from the steam. Don&#x27;t dry your face, just put it right on. :)</li>
    <li> Works exactly as it says.  I&#x27;m constantly amazed what is pulled out.  Gross, yes.  Good to have it out, also yes.  A very good product, and if it&#x27;s as benign as they claim, better than the alternatives.</li>
    <li> I use this once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I place this on my nose right after I shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works just as good as Bior, if not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do the cost calculations.</li>
    <li> These work really good, and are cheaper than most other brands! I used to always use biore, but these work better than even their \\&quot;ultra\\&quot; strips. Just be careful- they are VERY strong! With biore I had to steam my face, scrub it, then apply the strips to get the full effect. If I did all of that with these strips my skin might be raw! Now I can just wash and apply. Another plus is that they work well on the whole face, and not just the nose; just cut to fit! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and as usual, Amazon shipping was quick and reliable!</li>
    <li> Product ripped the skin off my nose. Be careful!</li>
    <li> It really has effect!</li>
    <li> I am a guy so I have very little experience with this type of product.  Sometimes they feel a little uncomfortable or harsh when removing, but I can&#x27;t say if that is typical as I have only tried this brand so far.  Also they are slightly too small for my manly, beastly nose so they don&#x27;t cover every spot that I want to &amp;#34;clean.&amp;#34;  That being said they pretty much do what you expect them to.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful plain and simple. I have always loved their products and will continue to be a buyer. All their products are great quality in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Tears everything off your face except black heads.</li>
    <li> Great nose strips.  I love seeing everything that they remove.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I followed all of the directions and when I removed it, my nose was clear of white heads. I haven&#x27;t tried Biore yet but I only used this twice and my fiance says he sees a dramatic difference. Make sure you leave no longer than 20 minutes though. If you feel that its yanking on your skin too much, just put a little warm water under the strip an pull slowly.</li>
    <li> I just put these strips all over my face while still damp from the shower, and after they dry, I peel them off. The blackheads get pulled out like little blades of grass from my nose and below my lower lip.  I&#x27;m not sure if much stuff gets pulled out of my cheeks and forehead, but getting even one blackhead out and preventing a pimple is worth it to me.</li>
    <li> Well, to be fair I am not impressed with the Biore face strips either, but these pretty much just ripped out some face fuzz and left the clogged pores undisturbed. I don&#x27;t think any of this stuff works that great unless you have pores that are fairly enlarged. Steaming and a gentle once over with a good clean comodone remover is still the best way to accomplish pore cleaning.</li>
