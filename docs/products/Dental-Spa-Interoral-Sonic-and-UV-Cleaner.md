      <li>but everything else is ok.</li>
      <li>glad I no longer have to spend time taking care of my night guard.</li>
      <li>Love the fact that it eliminates build up of debris and germs.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t tell if it truly is getting rid of germs, but I feel better cleaning my mouthguard in this than leaving it in the plastic one it came with.</li>
      <li>This review was posted, with more links and a picture, on my blog (at my name .com).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have spilled many times trying to get it out.</li>
      <li>I could still be using my &amp;#34;cups&amp;#34; to soak my dentures, this dental spa  doesn&#x27;t do any better.</li>
      <li>I estimate I was able to run it about 65 times before the batteries died.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m totally glad I bought this Violight product to sanitize my anti-TMJ mouthpiece.  </li>
      <li>It seems to be more of a vibrator than</li>

      <li>I love, love, love this dental cleaner.  </li>
      <li>Glad I purchased.  </li>
      <li>I estimate I was able to run it about 65 times before the batteries died.</li>
      <li>but it was in a review by a dentist, one of his top 3 picks for the price.  </li>
      <li>So, look for the notch on the cup :)</li>
      <li>The unit does make noise when the sonic mode is used, but it&#x27;s not terrible.</li>
      <li>When I opened the lid you were able to see all these specks removed.  </li>
      <li>We are both extremely satisfied, both with the product itself and with the way our order was handled.</li>
      <li>Simply -  this product has been great!  </li>
      <li>My night guard will even fit on top of the tray, though I don&#x27;t understand its purpose, so I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
      <li>Now I am so much more comfortable using my guard knowing it is disinfected.  </li>
      <li>I also keep it in my bathroom cupboard when I run it, so that blocks out the sound even more.</li>
      <li>Having a clean mouth is very important to me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had my original Violight cleaner/sanitizer for probably five or more years now.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> but inside the holding cup is too small if you have top and bottom dental is won&#x27;t work. but everything else is ok.</li>
    <li> This device seems to work well. I purchased the power cord shortly after my initial purchase so I can&#x27;t comment on battery life.  I&#x27;ve used this once/day since January 2013 and not one hiccup yet.  I use this with the SnoreRX snore appliance.  This appliance barely fits, but it will fit. You have to make sure you fill the water to exactly or slightly higher than the waterline in the dish. Overall, happy with my purchase as long as you have the power cord!</li>
    <li> It took me days to figure our how to work it. The instructions are not very clear. I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> After getting a new night guard that doesn&#x27;t have to be stored in water, I decided to splurge and get this device that cleans and sanitizes.  It works great, but due to the noise, I have to leave the bathroom while it is in its cleaning phase.  I&#x27;ve had it about a month, and it seems to be doing a great job.</li>
    <li> It works really great and is so easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m totally glad I bought this Violight product to sanitize my anti-TMJ mouthpiece.  I always worried there&#x27;d be germs growing on it, working on my mouth and down into my stomach at night.  Using a toothbrush on it was a pain, and I never knew if it was really clean.  Soaked it in hydrogen peroxide sometimes, but who wants to splash that around every day?  Soaking it in mouthwash, it tasted like mouthwash, and I didn&#x27;t think staying in contact with that all night was good. Isopropyl alcohol -- what if it made the material brittle?  This way, it&#x27;s quick, nothing to bother my fingers or mouth, and I know it&#x27;s clean. No funky smells or tastes, ever.  My dad has one now, too.</li>
    <li> I am a dental hygienist who wears a nightguard.  I was looking for an easier way to clean it.  The Violight has removed the smell that can sometimes come from the bacteria in our mouths, but it does leave a film on the nightguard.  This film rinses right off, very easily.  My nightguard has not accumulated any tartar while using this for the last month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My significant other also wears a nightguard and he has 3rd molars(so his is bigger), his barely fits inside.  I have to fill up the cup above the fill line, but it still works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: There is a specific way the cup goes in the machine.  If it is not put in properly when it vibrates its really loud. So, look for the notch on the cup :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional Note: I changed my rating to 2 stars because water keeps getting into the battery compartment and corroding the batteries. I was having to change them every month until I got tired of it and purchased a different brand that I can plug in to an outlet.</li>
    <li> My dentist has complement me on the condition of my partials.  The sonic and UV cleaner provides a healthier partial than just soaking in denture tablets.  An excellent investment.  &amp;#34;Himself&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My wife was having a difficult time cleaning her dental night guard. The dentist said to clean with just hoy water and a brush. That just didn&#x27;t clean it and left a residue on it.  She complained to the dentist and he had her bring it in for an ultrasonic cleaning.  That worked so well I started looking for a home cleaner.  I came across the Violight and figured for the price it was worth a try.  My wife is thrilled with it.  It works like a champ and now the mouth guard doesn&#x27;t develop what my wife calls a \\&quot;nasty taste\\&quot;.  Great unit, great price.</li>
    <li> Size &amp; design are ideal. Easy to operate, does the job effectively &amp; eliminates the use of tablets.  Seems a more hygienic approach to cleaning &amp; disinfecting partials &amp; dentures.</li>
    <li> This product is at best useless; at worst - a worthless piece of junk taking up space on the bathroom cabinet.</li>
    <li> I use a night guard due to dental work. I purchased this product to  sanitize my guard.Overall, I am pleased with the item  because it is not another thing that I have keep plugged in, as this is battery operated and can be easily used/stored in a drawer. I feel it keeps my guard clean. My only  caution is for those who do not have nimble little fingers. The  inside tray is  very difficult to remove  due to the  design.  This may not be a product for all.</li>
    <li> This thing makes a bunch of noise. About it. Better running it under hot faucet for a minute than bubbling it up.</li>
    <li> while it does take the \\&quot;smell\\&quot; off the retainer, it doesn&#x27;t seem to remove all the plaque.  I have tried using the ultra sound daily and still find build up.  I could have saved the money and bought a stiffer tooth brush and brushed the retainer daily for equal results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this appliance and feel it promotes a healthy mouth.  It does make a little noise when I first use it but I time things so I am not in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> Glad I purchased.  Now I am so much more comfortable using my guard knowing it is disinfected.  The unit makes noise but only for a couple of minutes, well worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to clean my Invisalign and have been pretty happy so far. I looked around and could not find anything similar for cleaning dental gear. It is battery operated but does have a DC 5.5V 500mA connection in the back. I wish it would have come with a power adapter as I pretty much leave in the bathroom. That would save on having to use batteries all the time.    Pros:  - Uses tap water so you don&#x27;t have to waste money on cleaning solutions.  - I do notice debris in the tray after cleaning my Invisalign so I think it&#x27;s working. When I wear them after cleaning they feel smooth and clean.  - Battery powered so you can take it with you wherever you go.    Cons:  - It&#x27;s a bit loud and scares the cats every time I start it. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and I think they&#x27;ll eventually get used to it.   - The tray is a bit small so you won&#x27;t be able to fit anything bigger than dental gear in there.  - You have to fill the cup to almost the top and I frequently spill water whenever inserting or removing the cup. Not much but some.    Would I buy this again or recommend to someone else: YES.</li>
    <li> Just 6 months later and it no longer works.  When I first purchased the unit it worked great and was exactly what I needed.  It is too expensive to be a \\&quot;disposable.\\&quot;  I am very disappointed in Hamiliton Beach with this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife&#x27;s retainers. She has top and bottom traditional wire retainers, not the invisible type, and uses this daily to keep them clean.    The unit does make noise when the sonic mode is used, but it&#x27;s not terrible. It makes about the same noise as my shaver, and it&#x27;s quieter than her hair dryer. She cleans both retainers at the same time and it runs quieter depending on how she places them inside. Also, she starts the unit before getting into the shower. That way it&#x27;s done when she gets out and you don&#x27;t even notice the noise.    I recommend getting the AC adapter, too. We started with batteries but they wore down fairly quickly with daily use. I couldn&#x27;t find the adapter on Amazon, but ordered one from Violight&#x27;s website. With the adapter this would be five stars. Great product!</li>
    <li> This product is very good. I bought it as a present for my dad to help him cleaning his dentures. It works. Can also be used with jewelry. Would buy it again!</li>
    <li> This is a product that you really can&#x27;t tell if it is doing its job or not.  My dentures look very clean and the product works good so I guess it is.  I got my husband one too and as far as we know it was a good thing to get.  It also helps to not have to buy the cleaner tablets.  With this you just use water.  It is a little pricey, though.</li>
    <li> Have a TMJ appliance &amp; the dental spa works great at cleaning this.  Very easy - just have to fill cup with water, put appliance in, &amp; press 1 button.  Can see this is doing a good job at cleaning by the debris left in the water.  Has some noise for the 5 min. it&#x27;s doing the sonic cleaning, but nothing major.  I usually just close the door while it&#x27;s doing this &amp; don&#x27;t hear it at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing retainers for over 20 years. I used to brush them with toothpaste to keep them clean. Then, I started using AquaFresh Retainer Cleaner tablets. I loved these. Unfortunately, they stopped selling them, and I had to turn to regular denture cleaner tablets. They where okay, but didn&#x27;t always get my retainers clean. I then stumbled upon the Violight Dental Spa. After reading the reviews, I was a bit unsure. Some people had said that it didn&#x27;t clean well and it made a lot of noise. I figured, I&#x27;d take a chance. I&#x27;m glad I did.    I can&#x27;t speak for anyone else, but this product has worked for me. It cleans my retainers quickly and efficiently. When I first turned it on, I expected it to make a racket, but it was really quiet. I&#x27;ve learned that the key is to make sure that the cup is firmly seated and filled to the line with water. If you do that, it does make a vibrating noise, but it&#x27;s not at all loud. If you don&#x27;t do that, it does make a lot of noise. Just follow the instructions.    There is one thing that could be improved. It is a bit difficult to remove the cup to fill it with water and empty it. When it is properly seated, it&#x27;s in there good. It would be nice if there was a little side handle to help lift it out. I usually just leave the cup in and dump the water out. Not ideal, but it works.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have the latest Oral-B SmartSeries electric toothbrush, and even though I replace the various brush-heads every 3 months, I use the Violight Dental Spa to sanitize the brush-head(s) daily. I also use this unit to sanitize my whitening trays. Helpful Hint: When using the Sonic/UV feature, be sure to apply a little pressure when putting the water tray in the unit, as this will lessen the vibration/buzzing sound of that setting. I&#x27;ve had this unit for about a month now and am very pleased with it!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Dental Spa after reading the previous reviews and decided to give it a try. I have retainers and have been using the over the counter plastic box style with the tablets. The two types seem about equal in cleaning. The retainers still need manual scrubbing just like the manual box. I was interested in the sanitizing aspect but will have to take the manufacturers word on that since there is no way of actually knowing if that is happening. On the plus side it is easier to take when traveling.</li>
    <li> This dental cleaner runs through batteries too quickly. After less than 9 months, it has just quit working. Very disappointing. Would advise others to purchase an electrical dental cleaner.</li>
    <li> Use this product for cleaning dentures and for cleaning electric tooth brush heads! Our teeth have never been so happy! It was a great purchase! Do yourself a favor!</li>
    <li> My teeth don&#x27;t look clean after using it, I have to clean them with denture tooth paste . I&#x27;ve gone back to using another machine I had where I used denture cleaner in the process.</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these I&#x27;ve owned, and when the first one stopped working, I had to buy another one immediately!  It sanitizes, and cleans your night guard, and if you&#x27;re anything like me, cleanleness is next to Godliness!  I highly recommend this product.  I have a vio-light for toothbrushes, too, and both products work well, and kill germs.  I found the best prices at Amazon.com!  I buy from them often![[ASIN:B000Y8BA2K Violight Vio300 Dental Spa]]</li>
    <li> Works great to clean and refresh my dental trays.  This is the second one I&#x27;ve purchased as the first one (after 5+ years) didn&#x27;t bounce well on tile floor.</li>
    <li> 1st used item as intended with the ultrasonic feature. After use my mouthpiece changed and became hard. I have not used the ultrasonic since in fear of further damage. I have been using the UV light and believe there is still benefit in the sterilization.</li>
    <li> I have been cleaning my Invisalign trays using denture cleaner for a year now.  Every once in awhile I put them in diluted bleach to make them clear again.  But the thought of less mess and waste was appealing so I bought the Violight cleaner.  I used it every morning for a week instead of my usual denture cleaner.  By the end of the week my Invisalign trays were cloudy and covered in gunk.  I&#x27;m not sure the Violight cleaner is doing anything at all, to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes a loud vibration noise sometimes for the first five minutes but it&#x27;s not unbearable.  I know it will be finished in five minutes so I just deal with it.  It only does it when the inner tray is up against one of the outside walls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the idea of this product but in the end I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading all the previous reviews.  The product is quiet if you put the correct level of water in it.  Using the sonic mode burns the crap out of the batteries and I never really noticed it cleaning anything off of my mouth guard.  I now only use it for the light, which worked well for the past 6 months.  I have had to replace the batteries twice in 6 months.  Less than 2 months using both sonic and light and almost 3 for using light only.  If you are purchasing it for the sonic part, I&#x27;m not sure it will fulfill your expectations.</li>
    <li> Simply -  this product has been great!  I wear a mouthguard one night and a retainer the other night. They are not easy to clean. I used to clean them with denture cleaners, but the results were not very good. I still had to scrub with a toothbrush often.  The Violight VIO300 Dental Spa both cleans &amp; disinfects, and works wonderfully. I use it every other morning. I&#x27;ve used it four months now with no problems; in fact, I haven&#x27;t replaced the batteries yet.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I got this spa in hopes that I would notice a tremendous change in my retainer once I did the cleaning and Violight process, but not any different then when I use denture cleaning tabs!!  Very Unhappy with results!!</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t used my night guard in awhile. Trust me it didn&#x27;t look like anything I wanted to put in my mouth. This not only got rid of the yellow; it also aided in the comfort level of the night guard. I&#x27;m told that my mouth is on the large side (I have all my wisdom teeth), so the tray is a tight fit for me. There&#x27;s also a warning about looking directly at the laser light, I&#x27;m not sure what they&#x27;re referring to. Also the instructions could be clearer. Good machine.</li>
    <li> When I first got the Dental Spa it worked fine. Unfortunately this only lasted about a week and a half. After that the sonic cleaner stopped working. There was no warning and there didn&#x27;t appear to be anything wrong with it. It just stopped working. I kept using it, thinking at least the sanitizing light still works. A few days later, that stopped working too, leaving me with a $42 machine that did nothing. I returned it and got my money back. I would suggest that you just avoid the hassle and buy something else.</li>
    <li> I use this weekly for my facial flex and night guard.  Sometimes it is noticeable they are cleaned.  Simple to do:  put them in the water and turn on.  I have nothing else to clean them.</li>
    <li> just insert batteries and you are good to go.  Can&#x27;t tell if it truly is getting rid of germs, but I feel better cleaning my mouthguard in this than leaving it in the plastic one it came with.</li>
    <li> Use to clean and sanitize a partial denture and is only product that I know of that does both. Is compact, uses three AA batteries&lt;br /&gt;but  you can buy an electric adapter from Violight (about $10.00). Could also be used to clean Jewerly</li>
    <li> Vibration is incredibly noisy and does not clean well. I checked for water, as mentioned in other reviews, but none had spilled underneath the tray. It&#x27;s just an expensive paperweight at this point.</li>
    <li> When I first opened the package and started to use this product it was very very loud.  Even trying to wrap a towel around it to block out the noise wouldn&#x27;t work.  Upon further inspection we had a small amount of water in the unit which was causing the noise.  Now that it is dry it works just fine.  Great product and it does work!!!  My tooth guard had junk removed from it that the human eye couldn&#x27;t see.  When I opened the lid you were able to see all these specks removed.  GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> We have 3 hockey players in the house, along with a daughter that has retainers.  We constantly had mouthguards rinsed and drying on the counter.  Now the kids come home, pop them in the Violight for 5 minutes, and they are nice and clean!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my original Violight cleaner/sanitizer for probably five or more years now.  I&#x27;ve moved four times and have used it regularly for my retainers/night guard.  I&#x27;ve had Invisilines before, followed by a retainer/night guard for a number of years now.  My Violight has worked great.  I&#x27;ve figured out how to get my retainers into the cup, but agree with others it is tight - tried a couple different ways before getting the best fit.  I also have a 120v adapter, and that has it running smoother and saves on batteries.  Only reason why I give 4 rather than 5 stars is that for the price, a power adapter should be included.</li>
    <li> The  Violight Vio300  Dental  Spa  is a good idea, however the  design is poor.  For some reason, they sized it too small for  most single dentures.  If you have both an upper and lower  denture, it requires doing each separately as the bowl holding  the cleaning solution (water) isn&#x27;t deep enough to cover the  top denture.   This makes it a 25 minute process for each   denture.   Regrettably we had to return it to Amazon for  a refund.</li>
    <li> I have retainers, and I usually use polydent to clean them.  I switched to this and it is incredible.  I even cleaned my contax case...  Amazing product.  I am a frequent user of Amazon and this is the first product I&#x27;ve actually taken the time to review.  That&#x27;s now impressed I am!!</li>
    <li> Love it! Appears very well made. Does a nice job of cleaning my night guard. No smell afterwards. Can clean it with the water &amp; UV light combined or just the UV. It is noisy while cleaning, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. Means it&#x27;s doing a good job. I turn it on and walk away to do other stuff. When I come back, it&#x27;s done cleaning. I would definately recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s  smaller than I thought it would be. Some people complained that it is too small for their dentures and I can see how that could be true. We use it to clean a retainer and so far it is working for what we need it to do.</li>
    <li> At this time, I&#x27;ve only been using this to clean my retainer and my mouthguard. For my retainer, I normally use efferdent to get it clean, and when I soak it in water (without using efferdent), the retainer begins to build up an odd slightly opaque bacteria inside. I&#x27;ve been using this instead as it is cheaper in the long-run and I didn&#x27;t want to continue using the chemicals to clean my retainer, and so far it has been working. It only lasts for less than 10 minutes, and the buzzing isn&#x27;t too bad. If you live in close quarters with another person or a group of people, consider using this to clean your mouthware later in the day (late morning/afternoon/early evening). It has a UV and sonic function (UV light sanitizes while sonic cleans the gunk out) or you can only use the sonic. It doesn&#x27;t feel like its very sturdy, and I think if I ever dropped mine, it would shatter into a million pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would probably buy this again.</li>
    <li> This review was posted, with more links and a picture, on my blog (at my name .com).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I grind my teeth at night, badly. While there may a longer-term solution (I&#x27;m looking into it), I wear a night guard for the time being, to avoid further damage to my teeth. This led to a problem of its own though: fairly bad gingivitis. This got bad enough at one point, wearing the night guard hurt (my gums were so inflamed it made the night guard fit too tightly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that, the dentist adjusted the night guard to give me a little more room, and then I began a new hygiene regimen for myself and the night guard. I began flossing every night, and washing the night guard with soap and a toothbrush weekly. This helped some, but I still had a groove in my gums when I woke up, along the edge of where the night guard sits. The groove remained for hours after I woke up. Some time later, I began to search for another solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultrasonic Sound&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I go in for my semi-annual dental cleaning, I bring in the night guard to have the dentist ultrasonically clean it. It occurred to me that with technology these days, there might be an appliance that can do this for me at home. After some searching on Amazon, I found the VIOlight 300. They call it a \\&quot;dental spa\\&quot; - as good a name as any I suppose, but most people won&#x27;t know what you mean when you use the term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked it over the competition for several reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Price (though the others were close, and at the time of this writing, are even cheaper)&lt;br /&gt;* It cleans both ultrasonically and with UV light&lt;br /&gt;* It uses plain water, rather than a chemical&lt;br /&gt;* Though it doesn&#x27;t include a power adapter (it runs off of batteries), you can buy one for it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon reviews complaining of excessive noise caused me to hesitate, but eventually I pulled the trigger anyway, figuring it either wouldn&#x27;t be that loud, or I could solve the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hardware (The Bare Necessities)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device comes in a few pieces: the main unit, a little removable plastic inner cup, and a tray that can sit within that cup. The main unit has four small, springy rubber feet, and the plastic cup sits on an additional four rubber feet inside the main unit. It takes 3 AA batteries, and has a port for an A/C adapter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews on Amazon complained that the cup was too small to hold their dental appliances. I had no such issue (see below). My night guard will even fit on top of the tray, though I don&#x27;t understand its purpose, so I don&#x27;t use it. I have been told I have a pretty big mouth, so it should probably fit most people&#x27;s night guards as well. I could see though, that some mouth guards and other appliances might be too big too fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you set it to clean with UV and sonic (the other option is UV-only), the UV light stays on for 20 minutes, and the ultrasonic motor stays on for the first five of those. And what a five minutes they were. For the first several weeks of use, it sounded like I was mowing the bathroom lawn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring the Noise&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews had mentioned that the device could be noisy, and one review suggested a solution: make sure no water drips outside the cup into the rest of the unit. I took pains to follow this advice, and it definitely didn&#x27;t seem make a difference. Naturally, being a programmer, I began debugging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first determined the source of the noise. The device didn&#x27;t rattle the counter, a problem easily solved by placing a soft cloth under the device. Rather, the noise came from the lid... the plot thickens... Putting slight pressure on the lid stopped the loud rumbling, but it came back when I released.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Experimenting for several days, I thought I finally cracked it, thinking the solution was not to push the cup down with force. Instead, I lightly placed it into the cleaner, letting gravity do its thing. I also filled the cup with as little water as possible (well below the line marked on the inside of the cup), and still try to keep the device&#x27;s interior dry, though I&#x27;m not sure how much these measures help keep it quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After following these steps, the device hummed gently, more quiet than a running faucet. But the story doesn&#x27;t end there. I was thrilled when I discovered it (it actually made me want to write this review in the first place), and it made me 95% happy with the purchase. And then I changed the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, that solution worked when the batteries were sufficiently depleted so as not to fight the lid, so long as it had sufficient pressure against it. Once I popped in a fresh set, all bets were off. The only practical solution I&#x27;ve found is to lay a folded hand towel on top of it until the ultrasonic cycle has finished. It cuts down the noise to a dull roar, and isn&#x27;t terribly inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely open to other suggestions, but the end result disappointed me greatly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Power&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When purchasing the spa, I had planned on eventually buying an A/C adapter for it, but now I don&#x27;t think I probably well. I&#x27;ve been using the device for about 2 months, every day (sometimes twice), and only replaced the batteries today. I estimate I was able to run it about 65 times before the batteries died.

And conclusions are hard.</li>
    <li> Simple to use and small enough to be portable. It gives me piece of mind knowing the UV rays are deep cleaning my dental appliances and I maintain better health because of it.</li>
    <li> This thing works great! I use it twice a day. I was getting irritation and other gum issues from my night guard and it pretty much stopped once I used this product. It makes a little noise. Nothing more then a sonicare tooth brush (less actually).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not large, or expensive, and it does what it says. It&#x27;s nice when that happens.</li>
    <li> I KNOW OTHERS WERE UNHAPPY WITH THE NOISE OF UNIT.  I JUST TURN IT ON, CLOSE BATHROOM DOOR AND IT IS FINE.  WHEN I TOLD MY DENTIST THAT IT WAS BOTH A SONIC AND UV UNIT HE WAS DELIGHTED.  AND SO AM I.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for two years now.&lt;br /&gt;Use it to clean, or rather, sanitize my nightguard while its not in my mouth. Don&#x27;t Expect this thing to clean something all sparkly for you with just water. It is not loud, especially if you seat the tray in the correct direction.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this product. It stopped working after a two week use. I use it to clean my dentures. It doesn&#x27;t allow me to time it and when it does, it doesn&#x27;t turn on. I could still be using my &amp;#34;cups&amp;#34; to soak my dentures, this dental spa  doesn&#x27;t do any better. I would send it back, but I don&#x27;t have the box for it anymore.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the nightstand or bathroom counter. Use rechargeable batteries for less frequent changes.</li>
    <li> Alkaline batteries don&#x27;t last too long.  Not sure rechargeables would work (as they run at a slightly lower voltage).  Theory and practice sometimes diverge.</li>
    <li> I just recieved my Violight Denture Cleaner. Im not sure what I think about it. First off the inside is very small, I put each denture in seperately to clean them, and turn them over, so now my routine is an added 40 mins and Im not sure if the benefit warrants it yet. I still brush, and soak my dentures bi daily to ensure their clean. I was hoping this would make me feel like I was doing all that I could to take care of them. But I am unable to find any info on how much of a UV dose is provided during the \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot;. The bubbling action, is very mild, so I dont think that is a benefit at all. I could in all fairness, blow through a straw into my denture bath and get better bubbles! The Nano thing well who knows, the small amount of bubbling action, along with the light and Nano are not impressive. I may or may not return this item, havent decided yet. At this time I would not recommend this item. Im waiting on hearing from the manufacturer before I decide. But for the price and added time to my routine, its very pricey for the uncertainty.</li>
    <li> This was a gift that I have not given to the giftee as of yet,  Probably won&#x27;t give until the end of May</li>
    <li> I have no idea whether this thing is effective or not. I&#x27;m guessing this is one of those &amp;#34;no news is good news&amp;#34;/&amp;#34;if there&#x27;s no gunk on my bite guard it&#x27;s working&amp;#34; type of thing.</li>
    <li> Device does not work.  It lights up and makes a lot of noise, but there is minimal apparent cleaning once the cleaner shuts off.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This device has satisfied my expectations! It is so easy to operate. No more chemicals.</li>
    <li> This Dental Spa does not have a place to plug in and use electricity.  I had been told in a review to get one but I didn&#x27;t wait to see and realize none available.  I still have to brush my partial...so this product saves on the costs of buying cleaning tabs which also requires additional brushing anyway...and for that reason I will keep it for long term use.  :-)</li>
    <li> I could not use this product as the tray was too small for either of my dental appliances.  It would be helpful to have internal dimensions listed.</li>
    <li> I had white scaly deposits on my hawley retainer and I put it through the Violight cleaning twice and it didn&#x27;t remove it. I googled and found a way to remove the white scaly deposits: in a shallow glass, add 1/4 cup of white distilled vinegar and 1/2 cup of water. Soak your retainer for several hours or overnight depending on how much build up you have (I left mine overnight). Remove your retainer and you can use a wooden toothpick to gently remove the now softened deposits, then rinse away. It worked for me! All gone! They say for best results soak your retainer this way at least twice a week and you can reuse the vinegar/water solution up to 3 times. Now that my retainer is clean, I am going to use the Violight once a day to see if it keeps the scaly white build up away, plus it&#x27;s suppose to kill all the smelly bacteria.   Update: I have had the Violight for a month now, using it 3 times a week and there is no visible build up on my retainer. No smell either, so it works.</li>
    <li> UV cleaner works well. I mainly use it for sterilizing with the UV light. Has a nice tray to hold your items. Have had it for almost a year and only changed the batteries once. Don&#x27;t use it that much anymore lately as I have another one I used for my Philips toothbrush. Very portable and convenient. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> this worked great for the bottom dentures but the top would not even fit in&lt;br /&gt;the basket at all.  They just need to make the basket larger.</li>
    <li> This thing does work. If I had them on the first day I got my retainers they&#x27;d be great I think.</li>
    <li> Received this and used it right away to check the level noise that others have complained about. I followed the owners manual and it operated so silently I didn&#x27;t even know it was on. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this dental cleaner.  I am able to clean my partials without going to the dentist.  I also love that all I need is water and don&#x27;t have to buy special expensive chemicals!</li>
    <li> Product small enough to travel with in carry In carry on bags.&lt;br /&gt;Great gift for retainer wearers.  Item works very well for price.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed in this product.  It seems to be more of a vibrator than an actual&lt;br /&gt;sanitizer.  You are supposed to be able to clean a denture without chemicals but I have to put&lt;br /&gt;a denture tablet in mine or it doesn&#x27;t clean it at all.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for cleaning my Invisalign trays. Works perfectly. They feel clean. The unit is a little noisy, but this only lasts for 5 minutes, so it is not a big deal. It is worse if you do not seat the container properly in the unit. I should have bought one of these years ago.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t buy many of the positive reviews here AT ALL.  They are not accurate.  As others have noted, this device is indeed too small to fit many denture-type products.  My TMJ appliance, which I would hardly describe as large, could not lay flat though I could get it in if I sort of leaned it on its side.  More significantly, my TMJ appliance had some plaque build-up; not much at all but a little.  After I ran it as directed, the Violight did VIRTUALLY NOTHING.  The plaque is still there.  I am not buying the posted reviews that claim this thing&#x27;s so wonderful.  IT&#x27;s a scam.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> I use it for my mouth guard and it really works.  It is much better than my old method of scrubbing with a toothbrush.  The only thing that I do not like is that it is battery only.  I use it every day so it would be nice if it could plug into the wall.  I am pretty sure that I will take it when I travel.</li>
    <li> i add a spray of peroxide in the water when i use it and i believe it adds to the germ killing effect for mouth appliances.&lt;br /&gt;i also use the light button alone after i dump the liquid out for a couple of cycles.&lt;br /&gt;i use a splash of disinfectant mouthwash sometimes too. Just wishes it was slightly larger to put my eyeglasses in.</li>
    <li> This has been a wonderful product to keep the mouth guard I wear at night clean and odor free. .</li>
    <li> I love this thing. I use it to sanitize my Invisalign trays. I see all the gross things that are in the cup after they fall off my trays!</li>
    <li> So far, I am pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Apparently, this device is not FDA approved.  Also, the fact that it doesn&#x27;t include an AC cord makes it seem cheap.  As it is sold, you must use batteries to operate the device.  I called the company to ask why (as so many other reviews here state) it vibrates very strongly and loudly whenever you insert new batteries and over a couple weeks, becomes quieter and obviously is vibrating less.  She said that this is due to the battery gradually running down.  However! There is no low battery signal.  This alone says cheap to me and that the company doesn&#x27;t take things seriously when obviously, the ultrasonic and uv light are gradually not working full strength and no longer disinfecting your device.  So you have to buy the AC cord separately in order to get a consistent cleaning time after time (otherwise do you change the batteries as soon as the machine is obviously slowing down, or do you wait until the batteries are fully dead).  And they don&#x27;t sell this AC cord with this machine which should obviously have an AC cord sold together with the unit) on Amazon!  You have to dig around and find their website and then look through it to find the compatible cord.  This machine and company are a joke.</li>
    <li> I like the spa; however I wish it was a little larger so that my upper  denture &amp; lower partial could fit better.</li>
    <li> Go to Violight dot com and get the $9.99&lt;br /&gt;VIO300-AC Violight UV Dental Spa AC Adapter&lt;br /&gt;There will be far better vibration and UV light with this AC power supply than with batteries.&lt;br /&gt;There should be no rattle/bang noise if you push down the bowl firmly in place. This does make it very hard to pop it out though due to a friction/wedge fit (I just leave the bowl in place in the unit). There will still be pronounced vibration noise though, which is lessened if unit is on a towel.&lt;br /&gt;Edit 6/2013. I still very much like this unit. The click down lid vibrates and makes noise. This is easily fixed by just putting a small dish towel over the unit while on. The weight of the towel keeps the lid down and keeps it from making excessive noise.</li>
    <li> nice product, just wish it was big enough to put uppers and lowers in at the same time. Machine looks big in the picture but cleaning try is just to small for both at the same time. The cup your dentists gives you is bigger and it was free. easy way to clean one at a time though</li>
    <li> I just got braces off after two years. And was getting pretty tired of soaking my (clear) retainers every morning in a little container. I just felt that even though I used a mouth rinse that I purchased from my dentist or a mouthwash..they were not cleaning nor \\&quot;sanitizing\\&quot; them.  Now I just fill up the little cup and simply place my clear retainers (like invisalign braces) and prefer the UV/SONIC CLEANER button. ..everyday.  And I was unable to find the the adapter on Amazon as I preferred not using batteries as online reviews state the unit takes a lot of powerAnd ordered it directly from Violight. (MODEL: DSC -6FA-05) SPECIALLY FOR THE VIOLIGHT UNIT.    And I want to say..... THE ONLY WAY TO GO!  I would&#x27;nt be without it!</li>
    <li> Not big enough for a set of dentures.Spring holding batteries was too weak to hold them in place.</li>
    <li> Cleans so-so.  A bit loud as others have mentioned but I found a &amp;#34;sweet spot&amp;#34; placement for the inner tray that minimizes vibration.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to clean jewellery. It works perfectly. I found the container to be just the right size. It holds several items at once. Rings and chains come out beautifully shiny.</li>
    <li> I have been using a sonic denture bath with tablets and was not well satisfied, after changing to this &amp;#34;Dental Spa&amp;#34; I have noticed that my dentures are noticeably cleaner in less time.</li>
    <li> It does clean your dentures, just a little noisy but not on that long.  I like it.  It was well package and arrived early.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these for myself and a second for my son. We are both extremely satisfied, both with the product itself and with the way our order was handled. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This did not work.  We tried several sets of new batteries and it did not work.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> I use this for my night guard, and I am unsure if it works. The UV cleaner is probably doing its job, but the aggitation does not completely keep my night guard from building up grossness, and the tray even is starting to turn colors. Worst of all, this takes 3 AA batteries (an odd number, why??) and eats through batteries very quickly. I do like that it has an automatic timer so I can press the button and walk away.</li>
    <li> Noisy toy. It at least should come with AC Adapter. Small tray that can only hold an upper or lower denture on each cleaning cycle.I don&#x27;t see any difference after using this device.</li>
    <li> For a year I had been using the &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; cleaner that came with the retainer brite disolving tablets if you purchase a years supply.  On visits to the Dr they said they weren&#x27;t coming all the way clean (leftover calcium) and I had been noticing a slight smell beginning even though I brushed them with toothpaste too.  Strange since I used the retainer brite, the free cleaner machine that came with the tablets, and toothpaste.  I gave in and bought this sonic &amp; UV Cleaner and WOW!  What a difference!  My jaw splints (that look like mouth guards) are perfectly clean, don&#x27;t have to use the dissolving tablets, and there&#x27;s no odor whatsoever.  I highly recommend this cleaner.</li>
    <li> It seems more environmentally friendly than a packet of the fizzy tablets I used to get from the dentist and it works at least as good as they did.  I think I will eventually buy the A/C power supply from the company, though, because the batteries only provide a full-strength clean (you can tell by the sound) for a week or so and then need to be replaced after 3-4 weeks.</li>
    <li> We all have retainers and night guards of various thickness and this ultrasonic action is gentle and effective.  Love the fact that it eliminates build up of debris and germs.</li>
    <li> @ Amazon - I wish you had not charged me a restocking fee on this. This product failed AFTER the 30 days were up. I think it&#x27;s a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Cleans (not well) dental appliances, etc. I have a retainer that I use that I can get much cleaner by brushing than this.&lt;br /&gt;- Size (but also a CON)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Has option for power cable but insists you use batteries instead. Batteries run out VERY FAST. I have tried all kinds in this model.&lt;br /&gt;- Initial setup for cleaning. No matter how hard I tried, I could not get this thing to vibrate quietly. I did eventually get this tray to sit nicely but not without a struggle.&lt;br /&gt;- Malfunctioned after my 30 days were up. I first saw a light not lighting correctly. Then I noticed that it would vibrate and then just turn off despite new batteries in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If everyone reading this can get this to work properly, great! I hope you have success with this. I really wanted this to work but it just didn&#x27;t. Maybe when they improve the quality I will buy another one.</li>
    <li> My teeth do not fit, can only do the bottom partial.  The top plate does not fit all the way in, so is not of any use to me!</li>
    <li> I use this every day to clean my TMJ mouth guard and really like the product.  Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> My first try with this product resulted in it failing after fewer than 20 uses.  I emailed Amazon, and although it was after their &amp;#34;official&amp;#34; return date, they promptly replaced the unit.  In fact, I had just packed the non-working unit for return, when the delivery guy showed up with the new one.  I gave him the non-working unit for return.  The current unit is working fine and we&#x27;re well past the &amp;#34;20 times used stage&amp;#34;.  So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I both wear mouth guards and we use the product 4 or 5 times / week.  My guard had developed a lot of scale and after a few uses it has cleaned it up, pretty well.  I would recommend this product, with some reservations, but I&#x27;m impressed with how Amazon handled the first unit&#x27;s failure.</li>
    <li> STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!  This broke right after their 1 year warranty.  Customer service is the worst!  You will soon be out of your money, and have to buy another product.  They do not fix them, and don&#x27;t care.  A total rip-off.  Buy from anyone but them.  GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!  You will be sorry to have spent your money on this flimsy product!</li>
    <li> The main thing I don&#x27;t like is the tray is very hard to pull out. I have spilled many times trying to get it out.</li>
    <li> The product did not work as per design because the container that holds the Dentures was too small to accept a full set of Dentures. I was not able to use this item and returned it for Refund.</li>
    <li> works prety good, alittle noisy great for travel</li>
    <li> Having a clean mouth is very important to me. So, having this device allows me to keep my retainers clean at all times.  Im so happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Get a power adapter, you&#x27;ll need it. Replacing the 3 AAA batteries on a weekly basis gets really tedious, especially because the battery door must be unscrewed (you can use a quarter). I used rechargeable batteries for several months, but finally got a power adapter. Take the spa with you to Radio Shack so that you get the correct DC jack. The required voltage is a bit odd, and I couldn&#x27;t find a 5.5 volt adapter, but I have mine set to 4.5 volts and it works fine.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied. I am wishing it came with an ac adapter though. It went through the batteries pretty fast.</li>
    <li> It worked well for the first couple of months but then became sluggish. Would still be using it if it had not quit completely last week. Now I am trying to find a replacement device. I am not convinced spending nearly $50 every four months is smart so I have not made a decision on a new one yet. Still weighing the options available.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed at first, and it only worked part of the time. There is a certain way to push the middle down secure and then it works most of the time. The instructions didnt specify that. I use it everyday, and find it satisfactory.</li>
    <li> It does not get any stains off the dental appliance. Not sure if it is actually cleaning the appliance of bacteria?! Very dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> Excellent cleaner, good for on the road as well at home</li>
    <li> I read some of the reviews and the problems the were stated as reasons for not liking this product did not come into play, it works very well.</li>
    <li> The Spa operates as advertised.  The shape of the cup make it awkward to put the denture in the cup; it is a tight fit.  This is probably peculiar to me.</li>
    <li> So far I have not had any problems. I&#x27;ve had it for about a month and have not had to change the batteries yet, and I use it everyday. It was loud at 1st but after reading other reviews I learned that it usually means that there is drops of water under the tray, and there were. Once I wiped it off, it wasn&#x27;t that bad. I also keep it in my bathroom cupboard when I run it, so that blocks out the sound even more. So I can barley hear it. I&#x27;m really happy with it. (I use it for my night guard.)</li>
    <li> I guess I should have researched this product further but it was in a review by a dentist, one of his top 3 picks for the price.  I didn&#x27;t realize that you couldn&#x27;t shut off the UV portion of the cleaning or set the time for the sonic cleaning so it&#x27;s set for 15 plus minutes, altogether.  What really disappoints me is that, after a day or two, now, after cleaning, I get this green growth in the corners of the cup, itself.  Shouldn&#x27;t the UV light be killing any mold or bacteria that may be ggrowing?  Now, the cup is practically impossible to clean, as this green stuff is stuck in the corners.  It is very noisy, which I read in other reviews and doesn&#x27;t really bother me.  I do not notice an any difference in how clean my night guard is afterword or my jewelry that I have put in there.</li>
