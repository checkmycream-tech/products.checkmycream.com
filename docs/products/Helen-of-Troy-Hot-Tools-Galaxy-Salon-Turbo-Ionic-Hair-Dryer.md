### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Yes, I&#x27;m one happy camper!!</li>
      <li>After she made my hair looks absolutely awesome with it, I had to have it!  </li>
      <li>Best</li>
      <li>Awesome Hair Dryer!</li>
      <li>Also These Sellers are great to work with!</li>
      <li>PACKAGING AND SHIPPING WERE VERY GOOD</li>
      <li>Great lightweight dryer, comes with diffuser and concentrator.</li>
      <li>Great price!&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
      <li>Upon receipt, I thought it was great - lightweight, loved the matte finish, etc.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair look &amp; feel so good.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a chi hair dryer for years &amp; have not ever loved it.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely the best blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
      <li>I HAD THIS DRYER USED ON MY HAIR IN A SALON AND LIKED IT</li>
      <li>/&gt;Dries super fast!&lt;br /&gt;This really is a great product.</li>
      <li>I have many options for holding it depending on how I feel that day to avoid boredom.</li>
      <li>I thought the galaxy would have had more heat.</li>
      <li>Love this blowdryer.</li>
      <li>I AM GLAD I DID.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really use the rotation but it makes for great conversation.</li>
      <li>and I love the difuser.</li>
      <li>I love this hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to receive this dryer as I have always been happy with Hot Tools.  </li>
      <li>The concentrator, on the other hand, fits perfectly.)</li>
      <li>The industry needs to develop a significantly quieter hair dryer to reduce the damage done to women&#x27;s hearing over the many years we use hair dryers.</li>
      <li>My favorite feature is the low setting, where the dryer blows so slowly/softly that my hair doesn&#x27;t fly all over the place when I&#x27;m using my styling brush.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also lightweight and easy to hold.  </li>
      <li>We have an old Quiet Styler by Sassoon that is great, but nothing out there is kind to the ear drums these days!</li>
      <li>but it is very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from this, I really love the dryer.</li>
      <li>Light and powerful.</li>
      <li>As a pro I love this dryer my clients hair comes out soft and it dries hair quickly!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ultra fast dying, and the pivoting handle makes it so comfortable to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth spending a little bit more to get much better quality than the ones that you can find at the drugstore.</li>
      <li>I expected swivel function of the dryer&#x27;s arm to work more easily.  </li>
      <li>While the orbiting handle is a cool feature, I haven&#x27;t found much use for it - yet.</li>
      <li>The dryer does  a fine job of drying my hair, but it is not particularly quiet nor is it particularly light.</li>
      <li>I went to ulta and tried it out first.</li>
      <li>I called Hot Tools</li>
      <li>I recommend it for people with children that need a hair dryer that can get all those little heads dry quick in time for bed, and also great for Mom or women to get that hair style just right!</li>
      <li>Drys hair fast</li>
      <li>This dryer did cut my drying time down significantly!</li>
      <li>It is lightweight and very quiet with just the right amount of heat.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>The diffuser is not deep and when held at a certain angle the fan makes a high pitched hum.</li>
      <li>After using drugstore hair dryers for years, I wanted to upgrade to a professional dryer without spending a fortune.</li>
      <li>It was too loud...</li>
      <li>Given that it is significantly more expensive than many other dryers, I felt it should be both quieter and lighter.</li>
      <li>The product is lite in weight and has some good accessories,  but I would only recommend it for someone who has normal to thin short hair.</li>
      <li>The dryer would not turn on when on the low setting and the high setting was low.</li>
      <li>If I want, I can send back the entire dryer (at my expense) and they can send me a new one.... 2-3 weeks after they receive it from me.</li>
      <li>one complaint about this dryer is that the diffuser that came with mine is WAY too big to fit on the dryer.</li>
      <li>After doing some research on the internet, I selected the Hot Tools HT7002 because it came with the narrow concentrator as well as a diffuser.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> For the price, ya can&#x27;t beat it. And as for those that say it noisy, there are 5 of us in 20x12sq.ft. room who now use this dryer &amp; what a difference it makes.</li>
    <li> I expected swivel function of the dryer&#x27;s arm to work more easily.  Swivel is clunky</li>
    <li> Love this blowdryer. I have many options for holding it depending on how I feel that day to avoid boredom. Light and powerful.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever used! As a pro I love this dryer my clients hair comes out soft and it dries hair quickly!  Best</li>
    <li> This is not a professional quality blow dryer. But it is lightweight.</li>
    <li> The dryer does  a fine job of drying my hair, but it is not particularly quiet nor is it particularly light. Given that it is significantly more expensive than many other dryers, I felt it should be both quieter and lighter. I kept the dryer because I cut off the labels on the cord before I realized I would have preferred to return it. The industry needs to develop a significantly quieter hair dryer to reduce the damage done to women&#x27;s hearing over the many years we use hair dryers.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer lasted one month and then lost heat.  Would definitely not recommend this product.  Too expensive to have this happen and of course out of the return window.</li>
    <li> Awesome Hair Dryer! It&#x27;s ultra fast dying, and the pivoting handle makes it so comfortable to use. I recommend it for people with children that need a hair dryer that can get all those little heads dry quick in time for bed, and also great for Mom or women to get that hair style just right! Also These Sellers are great to work with! Product came just as described in a very short amount of time.</li>
    <li> It was too loud...looking for a quiet hair dryer but not much out there!  We have an old Quiet Styler by Sassoon that is great, but nothing out there is kind to the ear drums these days!</li>
    <li> I HAD THIS DRYER USED ON MY HAIR IN A SALON AND LIKED IT A LOT, SO PURCHASED.  I AM GLAD I DID.  PACKAGING AND SHIPPING WERE VERY GOOD AND DRYER IS JUST AS DESCRIBED.</li>
    <li> Great price!&lt;br /&gt;Not noisy!&lt;br /&gt;Love the handle!&lt;br /&gt;Comes with diffuser and concentrator!&lt;br /&gt;Dries super fast!&lt;br /&gt;This really is a great product. I went to ulta and tried it out first. Plus got it on sale for $39.</li>
    <li> Upon receipt, I thought it was great - lightweight, loved the matte finish, etc. but it did not even last a month. The dryer would not turn on when on the low setting and the high setting was low. Sadly,  I had to return it as a defective product.</li>
    <li> After using drugstore hair dryers for years, I wanted to upgrade to a professional dryer without spending a fortune.

(The piece that should attach to the end of the dryer can go half way down the barrel and never actually connect. The concentrator, on the other hand, fits perfectly.) I called Hot Tools and they said they cannot replace just the diffuser. If I want, I can send back the entire dryer (at my expense) and they can send me a new one.... 2-3 weeks after they receive it from me. I don&#x27;t know whether this is a common problem or if it is a fluke but it is very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from this, I really love the dryer.

    <li> My hairstylist uses this hair dryer.  After she made my hair looks absolutely awesome with it, I had to have it!  I&#x27;ve used a chi hair dryer for years &amp; have not ever loved it.  I love this hair dryer.  It makes my hair look &amp; feel so good.  I have naturally wavy hair, so I typically use a round brush when drying my shoulder length hair otherwise it&#x27;s frizzy.  I can round brush my hair in no time with this hair dryer &amp; it will not be frizzy.  It took me double the time to achieve the same results with my chi.  Yes, I&#x27;m one happy camper!!</li>
    <li> Drys hair fast and I love the difuser. My hair stylist was using it on me at the salon and I had to get one!</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer after my hairdresser used it to dry my hair.  My favorite feature is the low setting, where the dryer blows so slowly/softly that my hair doesn&#x27;t fly all over the place when I&#x27;m using my styling brush.

    <li> Great lightweight dryer, comes with diffuser and concentrator. I don&#x27;t really use the rotation but it makes for great conversation.</li>
    <li> Ad said &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; was heavy.  Size too big to handle.</li>
