### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>great for silver/gray hair</li>
      <li>Works great on my platinum hair.</li>
      <li>This is very effective shine.</li>
      <li>Works great, gives a really nice healthy shine.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want an oil spray...could use any kind of oil if I wanted that.</li>
      <li>This is wonderful stuff, althougth its not something you want to spray directly onto your hair.</li>
      <li>Even very lightly spritzed, it makes whatever hair it touches oily and stringy -- and yellowish, if you&#x27;re white-haired.</li>
      <li>I use this item all the time and absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I have used this spray for the last 7 months and  it is perfect for my silver gray hair.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Love this brand.  </li>
      <li>I love this product for silver hair.i spray this on after I style my hair,and it shines like polished silver.</li>
      <li>Very good product needs to be available in larger sizes 8 &amp; 12 oz.</li>
      <li>I have fine, frizzy hair.  </li>
      <li>Too greasy on fine hair.</li>
      <li>I spray it lightly on my hands, then apply an inch or so up from the roots to the ends of my hair.  </li>
      <li>Also, it does not have a strong odor or hardly much odor at all, and I really appreciate that too.</li>
      <li>Wow wee super shiny silver!  </li>
      <li>I spray it into my hand and work it through wet hair, or I can spray lightly on my hands and run my fingers through.</li>
      <li>When I sprayed directly onto my hair, I felt I got too much of it.  </li>
      <li>Also, as many mentioned, a tiny bit of this product goes a long way, so you have lots of ability to control how much you use, from just a spray onto your palms to actually spraying each part of your hair on your head.  </li>
      <li>If your hair isn&#x27;t dry I could see it would add too much oil, but for me it is wonderful and the only thing I&#x27;ve found that helps moisturize without weighing my hair down excessively.  </li>
      <li>but when I spray it one my almost platinum light blonde hair..it makes it wet and look yellowish.</li>
      <li>really helps taming and controlling white hair.  </li>
      <li>It really brings the shine back to my hair.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want to use a flat iron because I have curly hair and don&#x27;t want it straight, so ...</li>
      <li>True it does add to my shine on the gray hair, but caution it is a little oily</li>
      <li>This product was a little over the top ~ I used it like I&#x27;ve used shine sprays before &amp; it made my hair look wet ~ too oily for me.</li>
      <li>So, if you have GRAY hair that is natural or you&#x27;ve colored it blonde, AND your hair is DRY and not oily, it is FOR YOU!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<li> have bleach blonde gray hair, it&#x27;s very very dry, and I squirt about 3 squirts on my  hair right after blow drying and round brushing</li>
<li> It keeps my hair wet looking and gross.</li>
<li> it goes a long way.</li>
<li> So I now spray 1 or 2 sprays into the palm of my hand, rub together and then through my grey locks.  </li>
<li> I hoped this would restore some surface shine after using dry shampoo, which can leave a dulling film.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll definitely buy this product again but a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> I also have very dry gray/silver hair.  </li>
<li> Maybe it would work on very dry, frizzy hair.</li>
<li> You must be careful to use only a little</li>
<li> I love this spray - too bad</li>
<li> Just remember that a little goes a long way.  </li>
<li> It made my hair dark and oily</li>
<li> and it helps my hair tame down and keeps it from looking frizzy when it&#x27;s humid.</li>
<li> use just a little.</li>
<li> I previously used the aerosol and am now purchasing the plain spray.  </li>
<li> It is SHINE spray that helps TAME your hair.  </li>
<li> Frizzy looks very dull.  </li>
<li> This hair spray is absolutely the worst hair spray I have ever used!  </li>
<li> Unfortunately it made my hair look greasy rather than shiny.</li>
<li> Horrible!!</li>
<li> Just really terrible.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Keep my hair shine but on the next day my hair looks gross</li>
    <li> I also have very dry gray/silver hair.  This product both adds shine and helps me manage it so it isn&#x27;t quite so fuzzy. and straw-like.  If your hair isn&#x27;t dry I could see it would add too much oil, but for me it is wonderful and the only thing I&#x27;ve found that helps moisturize without weighing my hair down excessively.  I&#x27;ve tried argan oil sprays and they don&#x27;t add the shine and they make it look greasy in ways I don&#x27;t find with this product.  Also, as many mentioned, a tiny bit of this product goes a long way, so you have lots of ability to control how much you use, from just a spray onto your palms to actually spraying each part of your hair on your head.  Also, it does not have a strong odor or hardly much odor at all, and I really appreciate that too.</li>
    <li> It really brings the shine back to my hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this spray for the last 7 months and  it is perfect for my silver gray hair.  However, I had to put the (liquid) spray into a different spray bottle to enable it to be distributed in a mist instead of droplets or the need to spray on palms and then apply to hair.  My hair (4a/b/c) remains shiny all day and doesn&#x27;t feel oily.</li>
    <li> This product was a little over the top ~ I used it like I&#x27;ve used shine sprays before &amp; it made my hair look wet ~ too oily for me.</li>
    <li> True it does add to my shine on the gray hair, but caution it is a little oily</li>
    <li> I have fine, frizzy hair.  Frizzy looks very dull.  I don&#x27;t want to use a flat iron because I have curly hair and don&#x27;t want it straight, so ... curly equals frizzy.  This is the only product I have found that gives me shiny, healthy-looking hair.  BUT, you must use it correctly, or it can look greasy.  I spray it lightly on my hands, then apply an inch or so up from the roots to the ends of my hair.  Immediately, I have shiny hair.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> I hoped this would restore some surface shine after using dry shampoo, which can leave a dulling film. It doesn&#x27;t. Even very lightly spritzed, it makes whatever hair it touches oily and stringy -- and yellowish, if you&#x27;re white-haired. Pitching it. Maybe it would work on very dry, frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I love this spray - too bad I cannot get it delivered to my home in Canada.</li>
    <li> Of all the shine sprays I have tried, this was pricier and greasy! Even after using only 3 shorts sprays, my hairs feels like I washed it in Vaseline (and my hair is on the dryer frizzy side). Horrible!!</li>
    <li> great for silver/gray hair</li>
    <li> Unfortunately it made my hair look greasy rather than shiny.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful stuff, althougth its not something you want to spray directly onto your hair. Pump a couple sprays onto the palm of you hand and rub your hands together - then apply your palms to your hair. Works great, gives a really nice healthy shine. I love it!</li>
    <li> Works great on my platinum hair.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it at all. I didn&#x27;t want an oil spray...could use any kind of oil if I wanted that.</li>
    <li> Too greasy on fine hair.</li>
    <li> This is very effective shine. You must be careful to use only a little or you will have oily hair. I spray it into my hand and work it through wet hair, or I can spray lightly on my hands and run my fingers through.</li>
    <li> This hair spray is absolutely the worst hair spray I have ever used!  It made my hair dark and oily - ugh!  Just really terrible.  I had to re-wash my hair before I left the house and the oil residue still was there!&lt;br /&gt;I threw it away!</li>
    <li> Very good product needs to be available in larger sizes 8 &amp; 12 oz. N</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would be</li>
    <li> I use this item all the time and absolutely love it. Just remember that a little goes a long way.  If you overuse, it will make your hair appear greasy!!!!!! Instance results!</li>
    <li> Did not like this product...made hair look greasy not shiny</li>
    <li> Love this brand.  I previously used the aerosol and am now purchasing the plain spray.  I have silver hair and it does make it shine.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s must be used properly.  It&#x27;s NOT hair spray, in the sense that it would HOLD your style. It is SHINE spray that helps TAME your hair.  So, if you have GRAY hair that is natural or you&#x27;ve colored it blonde, AND your hair is DRY and not oily, it is FOR YOU!!&lt;br /&gt;I have bleach blonde gray hair, it&#x27;s very very dry, and I squirt about 3 squirts on my  hair right after blow drying and round brushing and it helps my hair tame down and keeps it from looking frizzy when it&#x27;s humid.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Directions call for three sprays.  When I sprayed directly onto my hair, I felt I got too much of it.  So I now spray 1 or 2 sprays into the palm of my hand, rub together and then through my grey locks.  Wow wee super shiny silver!  I&#x27;ll definitely buy this product again but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love this product for silver hair.i spray this on after I style my hair,and it shines like polished silver.My hair is silver blonde.</li>
    <li> I like how this is tinted violet but when I spray it one my almost platinum light blonde hair..it makes it wet and look yellowish. It keeps my hair wet looking and gross. I do not recommend this at all for blondes.</li>
    <li> really helps taming and controlling white hair.  use just a little. it goes a long way.</li>
