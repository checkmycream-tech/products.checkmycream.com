<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I do like it but it doesn&#x27;t last very long. I feel that I am better off with the salonoas patches</li>
    <li> when I have sore muscles this cream works so well.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for four years. I play tennis and every time I have muscular pain I use it and get comfort and relief.</li>
    <li> i can&#x27;t believe it works, but it does. not good for sensitive skin people</li>
    <li> A friend introduced us to Forever Living Aloe Heat Lotion many years ago when our son had a softball sized bruise on his arm (from a softball - go figure).  Our friend told us that this lotion does something unique in that it will disperse the pooling blood around a bruise.  We tried it and within a couple hours, the bruising was definitely getting lighter.  Many analgesics have an unpleasant odor, but we find that the eucalyptus in the Aloe Heat is more pleasing.  Although I can&#x27;t say for sure the lotion did the trick, or if a combination of the lotion and ice, but we were sold.  From that point forward, we have used this for all our bumps and bruises (no open sores!) and it has worked wonders!  I used to drive a truck and my neck would get so stiff and painful, it was hard to turn.  I used Aloe Heat Lotion on my neck and it would loosen right up. Whenever I overtax my muscles, on goes the Heat and they feel better within minutes.  This lotion seems to soothe mosquito bites, too.  Just a little dab will do, so one bottle lasts a long time.  Caution - do not use around the eyes as it will sting and burn the eyes.  Of course, do not use on any open wounds or scratches!</li>
    <li> My husband uses it on his sore neck (he has a pinched nerve) and it seems to sooth it, so that&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> I have purchased about 7 \\&quot;Aloe Heat Lotions\\&quot; because it stimulates your skin and it&#x27;s like heat pad&#x27;s on your skin. It works for everything and is worth the money. The shipping comes within 2-3 days and the packaging is welly packaged. It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> Very effective for joint pain</li>
    <li> This cream does exactly what it says it will do, I have RA and it takes the pain, stiffness and soreness all in one application.&lt;br /&gt;The best I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve used it now for over 8 years.</li>
    <li> This lotion works magic on back pain from sore or knotted back muscles.  It heats them up then relaxes them.  The best results are the next day when you neck can fully turn or your back is no longer hurting or sore.</li>
    <li> Great lotion for sprains</li>
    <li> I found it soothing and relieves muscle pain quickly, I would and have recommended the product to many of my friends too</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my mother. Sent it to her it arrived in a timely manner. And it actually helps to release some of her pain in her joints.</li>
    <li> I will never waste my money and time with anything else besides this product.&lt;br /&gt;For muscle pain and for profound muscle relaxation there&#x27;s nothing out here that surpasses aloe heat lotion. It worth every penny and will last  a long time.</li>
    <li> Great product. if you have sore mussels or neck pain or if you want just a nice massage. It is great with natural ingredients</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Works great.</li>
    <li> Have used this for 15 years and counting, has always worked to relieve pain.</li>
    <li> Great for muscle pain and even rubbing for an headache.</li>
    <li> friends recommended this, so I bought this. Good for sore knee for my mother in law. She likes it. I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> Not big fan of the smell of the lotion. I have been using the Propolis Creme from this company and very satisfied but this heating lotion is worse in quality than I have hoped for.</li>
    <li> Very nice product for my and for my mom. I  send this product to my mom, because, her aching back. And now taram taram, she it no longer has pain and she is completely healthy</li>
    <li> We have been using this product for years and are satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like paying the full price for items if I can&#x27;t find a better deal else where, I got lucky finding this brand on amazon. It was a gift for my mother in law, something I did right, for once.</li>
    <li> I have frozen shoulders and this really helps relieve the pain.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on any other joint pain for relief of my arthritis. It is the BEST!</li>
    <li> This is great for my insect bites...</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT WAS SOMETHING I USED IN THE PAST. IT IS SOOTHING AND EFFECTIVE FOR JOINT PAINS. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT</li>
    <li> I often had back pain since I&#x27;m tall and I work 6 to 7 hours in a row while standing. This really helped me. And it is also really helpful for me when I have my menstruation. It reduces my cramps. I don&#x27;t have to use painkillers as much as I used to now.</li>
    <li> Your skin gets some kind of warm, it acts just like a Vicvaporup or menthol, the difference is that this product costs more</li>
    <li> We were introduced to this product by a chiropractor who also had a massage clinic.  This is what they used on their patients.  We were impressed by the soothing relief given by this product and have been customers ever since.</li>
    <li> I recommend buying that product to use it for muscles pain as I do &amp;#60;&amp;#60; it is pretty amazing product</li>

The pain I have daily, all day is overwhelming and while this lotion obviosly doesn&#x27;t take it away it DOES relax &amp; sooth to the point I can concentrate on other things.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this!! I&#x27;ll definately ne ordering again as well as for family members who struggle with arthritis pain.</li>
