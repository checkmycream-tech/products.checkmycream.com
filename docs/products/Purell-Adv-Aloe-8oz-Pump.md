<li> For some reason it does not dry out your skin as much as other hand sanitizers.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m likely adding to the problem of creating &amp;#34;superbugs&amp;#34; but this is alcohol based and not really an &amp;#34;antibiotic&amp;#34; other than the fact that alcohol destroys the membrane of bacteria.</li>
<li> Antibacterial and skin softening usually don&#x27;t go together, but for what this is it does leave your skin slightly soft where others rip your hands apart.  </li>
<li> but it&#x27;s super expensive.  </li>
<li> Same for vitamin E, hardly any scientific evidence that it helps the skin in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> So far our 5 week old baby girl hasn&#x27;t been sick at all!</li>
<li> What can you really say bad about it.  </li>
<li> Leaked a bit in packaging but nothing major or crazy</li>
<li> Buying on Amazon is always hard to beat with price.</li>
<li> unfortunately, durability of container is little weak..</li>
<li> it doesn&#x27;t get nasty or freeze (others I&#x27;ve tried do)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this product at work...every day. One bottle was delivered damaged and about 20% had leaked out.</li>
    <li> Buying two  makes it  possible  to  have  a spare for yourself  or as  a present.  I love  the scent and  the  smooth  way it  makes  my hands  feel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m somewhat of a germophobe so I go through quite a bit of this stuff. I do love it and it&#x27;s saved me from many a cold/flu. Yes I know... I&#x27;m likely adding to the problem of creating &amp;#34;superbugs&amp;#34; but this is alcohol based and not really an &amp;#34;antibiotic&amp;#34; other than the fact that alcohol destroys the membrane of bacteria. Anyhow, good stuff.</li>
    <li> Beautiful item. Delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Shipped did not promptly, but arrived fast though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product was just as described and Nice quality.&lt;br /&gt;This sanitizer doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, not feel sticky when I use it and also soft scent of aloe is good. I love it XD !!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.&lt;br /&gt;But unfortunately, durability of container is little weak..&lt;br /&gt;sanitizer is already leaking from the pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. The expiration date is 09/2017</li>
    <li> I use this product at work, at home, and on the go. As a heal care woke I&#x27;ve tried several different hand sanitizers but this one is my favorite. The aloe smells really good and my hands don&#x27;t get that dry, cracked look after using it upwards of 2 dozen times a day. I won&#x27;t waste my money on other brands for home or on the go after having such a good experience with this product at my work. It makes a world of difference to those of us who have to use it daily.</li>
    <li> Does its job, cleans 99.9% of the germs and smells nice.</li>
    <li> smells good and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands</li>
    <li> Needed it around the office. Thanks for the 2 pack. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> I keep these throughout my house for a quick hand freshner and cleaner.  Soap and hot water is always best but, if you have pets or, constantly touching doorknobs or, other objects that are not always sanitized, it is an easy and quick way to clean your hands.</li>
    <li> can never have enough of this product thats for sure</li>
    <li> This has the best combination of scent, cleaning, moisturizing, and no sticky feeling afterwards. It does not dry out your hands, either. I&#x27;ve tried a ton of different sanitizers and Purell hit it out of the park here. I discovered this formulation initially at one of the doctors&#x27; offices I was visiting, then ordered from Amazon. Very happy!</li>
    <li> Leaves a residue on your hands.</li>
    <li> That aloe Vera is good for your skin is an old grandma&#x27;s tale. It feels soothing on the skin. But there is no scientific proof that aloe Vera is good for the skin or helps the skin in any way. Same for vitamin E, hardly any scientific evidence that it helps the skin in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This preparation of Purell sanitizers is much more expensive than the regular one, because they claim it has aloe and vitamin E. It smells nice, and feels nice on the skin, but it is not going to be any better for your skin then regular Purell.</li>
    <li> Purely is always nice.</li>
    <li> Kills 99% of all germs and that&#x27;s pretty fantastic.  I have one of these in every bathroom.  They are a must to everyday living germs and keeping yourself safe and sanitary.  Very convenient to use as well for a quick refreshing feeling.</li>
    <li> Shopping online, I often pick up grocery type items. I prefer the pink Purely but it&#x27;s super expensive.  Blue is nice too, then this Green one with Aloe then original. I recommend this product  but check out the others here on Anazon with the same brand name in different colors -scents</li>
    <li> Quick shipping. Great product.</li>
    <li> I love to have one of these in each of my vehicles. Buying on Amazon is always hard to beat with price.</li>
    <li> Leaked a bit in packaging but nothing major or crazy</li>
    <li> Good basic simple stuff that you can&#x27;t go wrong with</li>
    <li> I always have one in my bag... It&#x27;s the only hand sanitizer that doesn&#x27;t make me dizzy!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Purell.  What can you really say bad about it.  For some reason it does not dry out your skin as much as other hand sanitizers.</li>
    <li> The best when it comes to hand sanitizer.  Antibacterial and skin softening usually don&#x27;t go together, but for what this is it does leave your skin slightly soft where others rip your hands apart.  The other thing I like about this that I ran across accidentally is that I keep one in my car and from hot to zero temps it doesn&#x27;t get nasty or freeze (others I&#x27;ve tried do) so I can have it handy for whatever yuck happens in the car without having to carry another thing in my purse.</li>
    <li> Works well, great price and doesn&#x27;t smell too girly.</li>
    <li> I am a germ a phobic. I carry your product and use all the time.  This is an awesome product.</li>
    <li> This is second time I&#x27;ve bought Purell Aloe and I really like it.  Have tried many others, but like this item the best.</li>
    <li> Keeps those hands clean.</li>
    <li> The item was as described and arrived on time without any problems! This is the only brand of hand sanitizer that I will buy, and the price for this twin-pack was great. I would definitely recommend this product and this seller!</li>
    <li> Keeps my hands sometimes softer.  It does not heal, but keeps them from slitting as much.</li>
    <li> So far our 5 week old baby girl hasn&#x27;t been sick at all! We have 2 dogs and it&#x27;s the height of flu season, so they must be working!</li>
    <li> Great product especially helps prevent transmission of bacteria</li>
    <li> perfect size and works very well.</li>
