<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wayyy too thick for face. At best hand cream</li>
    <li> love the smell....using their products after having spa facial, much more affordable here!</li>
    <li> love it great product I would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> Love this stuff smells great and keeps you moisturized all day, smells great too!!! the best part is it is all natural!!! Wish it was a little cheaper. :)</li>
    <li> the best moisturizer I have used, It smells good and I have been using it for months, recommended to a few friends now they are hooked.</li>
    <li> Slather on before bed. Excellent absorption. Skin feels new, like a baby&#x27;s skin.  Gently tightens. Four people commented on how youthful my skin was--after only 1 week of use. Skin feels plumper, retaining moisture more efficiently.</li>
    <li> If you want to go organic on your skin, then the Eminence line is what you want. I used Lancome for  years and was completely satisfied with my skin using  their products. A few years ago I realized how many chemicals are in skin products that have very nasty side affects with long term use and decided to go organic. It took about a month for my skin to adjust to the new regime but I am more than satisfied with all of the Eminence products. Would highly recommend them to anyone who wants to stop polluting their bodies with chemicals.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer out there.  Goes on think but does not feel heavy.  And it can be thinned out by adding a small amount of water.</li>
    <li> I have been using Eminence Products for a year now and I am so very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;This coconut moisturizer is the best, the facialist at my salon has been using this on my face every month and&lt;br /&gt;I am loving it. My face feels so smooth and moist, looks younger too.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is also divine.</li>
    <li> Have used it for a number of years.  It&#x27;s great for dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is my second jar. I love this. It keeps my skin well hydrated.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Moisturizes like coconut oil but with out the greasiness. My mother use to work with and sell Eminence at the spa she worked at and told me to add a few drops of water to all the products before applying.  This not only makes the products last longer but aids in adsorption.  With out water this product is thick and rests on top of skin ( maybe ok for target dry areas at night) and makes it hard to evenly apply makeup after applying.  Mixed with a bit of water and it works wonders. Love, love, love</li>
    <li> I really like this face cream it feels very rich &amp; makes my skin feel hydrated without feeling oily.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> the best cream I have ever used</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is great for sensitive skin and makes my skin feel so smooth.  This small amount goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Very upset with this product. After opening the box and peeling back what appeared to be a sticker securing the top. I opened the jar to find the top cover laying in the jar, how could that possible happen if this was never opened.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It was used during my last facial. The smell is fantastic and it is light but effective.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and is so nourishing on my skin... love it and the whole line!!</li>
    <li> If you want a cream that will last you a long time, this is it,  BUT if you want quality this is NOT IT. the product does not improve skin quality and does not hydrate.  I have very dry skin, and a few minutes after I put it on my face feels drier. Also it goes on like paste and is not absorbed easily.  It needs some rubbing in.  I don&#x27;t think the price reflects the quality and definitely it is not for skin that needs hydration.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband since I already use other moisturizers from Eminence.  I love all of there products and when my husband was looking for a better moisturizer, I picked this out for him.  It smells amazing.  It goes on thick so I suggest watering it down in your hand a bit.  It definitely leaves the skin glowing and smooth.  My husband has been using it for a month and so far he likes it a lot, but doesn&#x27;t see a huge difference in fine lines just yet.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer</li>
    <li> super moisturizing for aging skin.  Works very well, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product. I fell in love with the scent. My only complaint was that it was rather thick. I use it as a night time product and I am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Like the cream but very thick. Need to add water so it is easier to spread on face</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried alot of &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; lines this has to be one of the best.  I also just use real organic coconut oil at night but it&#x27;s too greasy to put on during the day so this product is great!</li>
    <li> Still keeps my skin dry after applying it</li>
    <li> I love this masque.  This masque does everything it advertises.  Your skin is glowing, refreshed and hydrated when you remove the masque.  It also helps to remove any impurities.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Was at a great price and the shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> I have used these products for many years.  I love the way they keep my skin soft and smooth.  I recommend them for everyone, especially the over 50 generation!</li>
    <li> Product came in great form. Love this product. Smells a little too much coconut but skin feels great in the morning!</li>
    <li> Arrive with no leaks and tightly packaged. It does make my skin sweat a little bit. I only just started using it along with the cleanser so I am giving it a chance. I do tend to love Eminence products. The seller included a nice sample of lemon cleanser I am looking forward in trying. It smells yummy.</li>
    <li> the smell the richness, especially for my middle aged skin and I would recommend this to anyone especially mature skins</li>
    <li> Good product. Nice smell.</li>
    <li> This is the third eminence product that I have bought, and have been happy with all of them.  I have sensitive/mature skin and have been very pleased with Eminence.  Price was excellent too</li>
    <li> smells awesome, go on thick but feels great</li>
    <li> This is reasonably priced moisturizer which to me, ranks with the very best for my dry skin.  I do use it both for night cream and day use under  sun tan lotion.</li>
    <li> I love the whole product line!</li>
    <li> I love Eminence products, however, if you have oily or combination skin, this is probably not the product for you as it is too heavy for that type of skin.  I plan on using it on really dry parts like my neck and chest area.  Smell is great.</li>
    <li> Eminence organics are simply the best you can buy. I&#x27;ve used them for years and my skin feels like satin. The moisturizers are fabulous for dry skin, which mine is now. Cannot recommend them highly enough!</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer ever. You don&#x27;t need much. Very cost effective.</li>
    <li> Really like this product, it makes a big difference.</li>
    <li> Very thick, heavy cream.  Feels like it&#x27;s clogging my pores.  I also question whether this line is actually organic and based on the ingredient list for this product, my guess is that it&#x27;s not, so the name is misleading.</li>
    <li> the Best rich moisturizer</li>
    <li> I use eminence products a lot. I have been using them for many years.  I love them and recommend them</li>
    <li> I was a bridesmaid in a wedding last year, and another bridesmaid I grew up with walks in and had skin that was literally. No not figuratively. Literally glowing. I see her putting this on before her mineral powders and stuff. I was like, &amp;#34;HEY, I grew up with you, what gives with this luminous skin and all. Gimme your secret!&amp;#34; And she did. This was my first taste of Eminence. Slowly building my collection the last year, I have happily tried a range of moisturizers, creams, masques, peels, toniques, and powders. I love them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went from basically store bought stuff like Oil of Olay and Aveeno to these amazing Eminence products, and I can tell you, you get what you pay for and will see and feel results very quickly. Even random people I run into comment on my skin and complexion now. So crazy, because I used to cake my face with makeup foundations and now get around mostly with my Eminence powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to all that are on the fence about it because of the price point, just treat your self. This is an investment in your skin and your face with the resolute of organic beauty care.</li>
    <li> I seem to love everything Eminence. My favorite with only the apricot whip face cream topping it.</li>
    <li> Just a little too much for me. Smells great but too heavy.</li>
    <li> Great service, and I love these products! my skin is very sensitive. I love how soft it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> I gave this product a 4 star because its so rich and creamy going on my face.  It soaks in well and does not leave an oily residue.  I have dry sensitive skin and this product does not bother my skin like others do and my face just soaks up the rich moisture.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. A little will go a long way. I have really dry skin and this has completely helped with moisturizing and making my skin glow.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really see a difference with this product. I have combination oily skin and I do need moister and this product is it. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY. I&#x27;ve been using this product for two and half weeks but I cant really say anything else about it. The coconut makes a nice soothing smell lol</li>
    <li> If you have oily skin, this product isnt for you.  Otherwise, it has a pleasant scent and really moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product and I highly recommend it!  I have been using Eminence Coconut Age Corrective Moisturizer for about 2 years and can really see a difference in my skin.  My skin is softer and the appearance of wrinkles has greatly diminished!</li>
    <li> I love all the Age Corrective products from Eminence! I have been using them for 6 months &amp; the health of my skin is amazing.</li>
    <li> Have been only using it a couple of weeks and my fine lines are disappearing around my eyes and mouth . And it&#x27;s also fading age spots . I am 41 and am looking 31 according to my husband . Amazing stuff !</li>
    <li> A really nice night cream and moisturizer. It&#x27;s a thick cream so those with normal or oily skin should dilute it with water before applying it. Doing this also keeps me from breaking out.</li>
    <li> i have used dozens of anti aging products, and this moisturizer is great for very dry skin. Smells like coconut, very pleasant.</li>
    <li> A small amount goes a long way. I wear this during the day and it lasts all day long and then some, if needed. Wouldn&#x27;t use another brand, ever.</li>
    <li> I had to give away this product to my friend because it broke me out.  I was really excited for this product! I had a sample and I loved it!  But when I used the product after I got it, it broke me out.  And since I purchased it online, I could not return it.  Sigh.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer!  My skin feels very hydrated.  The only thing I don&#x27;t love is that my skin initially feels a little &amp;#34;sweaty&amp;#34; when I first apply the lotion, but once it soaks in, it feels great!  Will definitely continue to buy.</li>
    <li> This product is great!  It is a  great  moisturizer, smells good,  and makes your skin look amazing.  Buy it along with their masquess.</li>
    <li> Just a beautiful feeling on my face!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and I do like it. I use it at night because it&#x27;s REALLY thick and during the day I feel like it would make my face feel greasy. When I wake up though, it feels great. Very soft and healthy!</li>
    <li> This product, like all Eminence I have used, is luxurious and effective, while being all natural and completely healthy--I love it!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping wonderful product, beautiful smell</li>
    <li> These are across the board good skin products, moist and helpful. The creme is emollient and smells wonderful, coconutty but not overpoweringly so.</li>
    <li> It is Amazing Cream ,The Best …….:)</li>
    <li> Eminence Products are the best!! My skin never felt so clean and fresh. I won&#x27;t use anything else on my face.</li>
    <li> I love this skin care line!  I recommend to all those who are looking for a high quality face moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer and the seller was great too..</li>
    <li> Excellent product especially if you have dry sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing!  It&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve ever put on my face!  I have dry/sensitive skin, and with other creams I would have to use a lot of it.  But with this cream, a little goes a long way.  Also, it smells like heaven!</li>
    <li> This &#x27;age corrective moisturizer&#x27;  is fantastic.  At first I did not care for the coconut smell, but that soon disappeared.  The Eminence Organics Coconut Age Corrective Moisturizer really made my face appear so smooth and silky  - - and even the fine lines were not so visible, and much to my surprise, my face took on a brighter &#x27;glow&#x27;.  I have used Eminence Organic products before and will continue using this line because they truly are great for my skin and I am never disappointed in the final results. It is the very best you can do for your skin.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff. It sinks in quickly, is non-greasy and has helped heal chronic dry, flaky spots on her face. My 84-year old mother loves it too. It&#x27;s reducing the appearance of her wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I am on my second jar of this moisturizer and I really love it.  I use it on my face and neck area daily and it keeps it very moisturized all day and night, and it is still soft when I wake up in the morning.  It has a nice scent to it, but it&#x27;s not so strong that you continue to smell it after you have smoothed it into your skin.  I&#x27;m 53 years old and I have always taken good care of my skin and used many products over the years, and this is one that I plan to keep in my skin card regimen.  I also love that it is natural and organic.</li>
    <li> This just makes your skin feel amazing. It is so thick, and yes it can make your face sweat, but not like you went to the gym. Its literally for like 5 minutes and it doesnt always happen. I LOVE this cream</li>
    <li> This is a very creamy moisturizer with a great scent, makes my face smell so good.  You need just a drop for each cheek so it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I use this as a deep moisturizer on my hands and feet before bed.  Keeps my skin soft and supple and youthful looking.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It has made a huge difference to my dry skin. Looks and feels so soft. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Wonderful and it can be made to go on lighter when applying under their tinted sun protection moisturizer, but allow 10-15&amp;#34; to be absorbed. At night I apply it heavier as I live in a low humidity area of the Country.</li>
    <li> It is so rich....it caused my skin to break out.  Might be ok for very, very dry skin.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t decide on 2 or 3 stars, so I rounded down. My skin definitely feels softer after using it as my night cream, but I&#x27;ve noticed I break out a little after use. The breakouts aren&#x27;t huge, just one or two small bumps, but it&#x27;s abnormal for me. I wonder if this is too thick for my combo skin. It seems weird now to say that because originally I had thought it was lighter than most night creams I have used in the past. The reason I purchased it was for the retinol alternative, but I&#x27;m not quite sure if it&#x27;s better than the last night cream I used (blueberry soy night recovery). Also, it smells a little off. I&#x27;ve read other reviews rave about how much they love the coconut smell, but to me it smells like coconut AND. . . a faint hint of a bad perm. Is that the way its supposed to smell? If not, I definitely got duped with some fake product. Also, there were bits of a faint yellow on top of the cream when I first opened it. I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s just an old product. If that&#x27;s the case, I bought it from International Skin Care in case anyone is wondering.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and feel of this cream.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and the moisturizer helps alot</li>
    <li> This product is not meant for oily skin and if you don&#x27;t like thick opaque lotion. Its feel like you are putting on sunscreen and you can feel the thick layer of product on your face. However if you have super dry skin, this might be the perfect product for you.</li>
    <li> Love my new cream!!...</li>
    <li> Product smelled sort of old; had my most recent in store purchase for comparison. I normally love Eminence products but this seemed a little off.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be without this! Super rich and moisturizing to the skin. Yet, doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
    <li> Not authentic. Jar was opened already when I got it.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time. Smells wonderful of coconut. A little goes a long ways. I moisten fingers with water or astringent to spread it out. Works well under mineral foundation as well as liquid. Used for only 2 weeks and plan on getting the moisturizer with sunscreen. I have recommend this product to several friends and will continue to do so. Wish I had found this years ago. I&#x27;m 72 and often get complacent on how nice my skin looks.</li>
    <li> This cream is wonderful!!  Very hydrating without being greasy which is a lovely surprise.  The smell of coconut is a bit strong initially but fades. I use this with the Eminence Bamboo Firming Serum and the Eminence Firm Skin Acai Moisturizer.  I sometimes mix the two to get a little added firming. I love that it is organic too.  Seller was very fast with shipping.</li>
    <li> I love the Eminence Organic skin care line, but I&#x27;m not fond of this particular moisturizer. I use this with the Stone Crop serum and a few drops of water. It works so-so when it comes to moisturizing, but what I dislike the most is how much it makes my skin sweat. I put this on my skin and not even two minutes later my entire face is covered with beads of perspiration. Needless to say I only use this moisturizer at night now. Trying to wear makeup on top of this moisturizer makes me look like a twenty-something menopausal woman with uncontrollable sweaty hot flashes.</li>
    <li> While this product might work well for others, my skin is very sensitive and this product made my skin turn red and produced a burning feeling.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the scent before, but I don&#x27;t really notice it anymore. I found it to be a little cloying at first but after about 2 months of use the scent has either mellowed, or it just no longer bothers me. I put it on as is at night, and thinned with a drop of water in the morning. My skin looks fantastic and this is the first time in living memory that I haven&#x27;t had itchy flaky skin in subfreezing temps. I wash with the Blueberry Soy face wash with a little of the Strawberry Rhubard Dermafoliant mixed in. I follow with the Stone Crop Hydrating Mist and then the Coconut Moisturizer. Once a week I use the Pumpkin Enzyme Peel. I&#x27;m 32 and my skin looked every bit of it and then some before I started using Eminence products back in July. Now my skin looks as good as it did at 25. Love it!</li>
    <li> This cream smells and feels delicious!</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the best products I have ever used on my face.  You have to emulsify it with water when putting on your skin as you do with most of the Eminence products and it is perfect for all day wear under your make up or as a night cream.</li>
    <li> love the smell and how it goes on...only thing is it does occasionally make my face sweat as a previous reviewing did indicate.  like what has done for my neck and back of hands</li>
    <li> Really like this facial moisturizing cream.. I use it as an overnight cream.</li>
    <li> I have tried Blueberry soy night recovery, firm Açai and the black Perlette Grape but the Coconut Age Corrective is my favorite among all the Eminence face lotions. It is very moisturizing and my husband loves it too because it doesn&#x27;t leave his face smelling like a &amp;#34;girl&amp;#34;. I also bought the strawberry rhubarb dermafoliant and I can clearly see results. My skin looks more youthful and clear. I love the fact that Eminence products are organic and natural. Eminence products are also a lot less expensive than the lotions sold at department stores. Love it.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS STUFF&lt;br /&gt;Hands Down....the most effective moisturizer I have ever tried.  I have sensitive, problematic skin, and this stuff has helped my acne prone, dryish skin!  Amazing!</li>
    <li> Heavy coconut fragrance, thick, difficult to put makeup on over it, NOT for humid, southern climates. NOt great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This cream smells delicious!  I didn&#x27;t think it was that great of a moisturizer because it was like a dry cream.</li>
    <li> As you get older your skin gets dryer. This cream is the only thing I have found that works for me.</li>
    <li> New product trying it with the coconut face wash , so far feels very soft and soaks in well on the skin ,nice and creamy ,!</li>
    <li> Excellent product...my skin is much more youthful.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I have dry sensitive skin and not a lot of moisturizers agree with me.  This one is a winner.  It&#x27;s a little more on the thicker side so it&#x27;s perfect for the dry winter months.  Plus it smells delicious!</li>
    <li> The cream goes on well but after it dries,it feels tight on my face and dry. I just don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin. I would not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve iever tried and it smells wonderful!  This is what my dermatologist recommends too</li>
    <li> I have been using Eminence for almost a year now and have seen such an amazing difference with my skin color, skin dryness, and overall appearance!  I highly recommend trying Eminence!  Once you try it you wont go back to your old face lotion!</li>
    <li> Too heavy ,but good. Price is way too high ,but I guess compared to others not bad.&lt;br /&gt;Not exactly a plastic surgeon here ,but never the less like what I see . See more of an improvement if you apply directly out of the shower when your face is slightly damp .&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again .</li>
    <li> Again-Eminence comes through.  I saw immediate results with this product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, you get the same results from a jar of pure organic coconut oil. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> A new star product from Emience&#x27;s anti aging line. The creamy texture is rather heavy for summer and spring, mix it with your favorite Eminence toner for a smoother finish. The mild heavenly coconut smell is perfect for your face.</li>
    <li> This is def. a very effective moisturizer, it lasts all day long. I use the Hauschka Rose Cream on top of it for a healthy glow in Winter my dry skin can use everything.  EDIT/Update: Noticed red little dots/rash on my skin from this cream, otherwise a great product if you can handle it.</li>
    <li> I thought this product would help with my dry and flaky skin which is something that started when I hit 50...It doesn&#x27;t help with the dryness and also no other noticeable improvements in skin appearance.</li>
    <li> a little goes a long way! gives my skin moisture and suppleness with no harsh chemicals! i love the smell. i use it with emminence serums and its just beautiful product.</li>
    <li> Very nice subtle fragrance and it keeps my skin very soft. A little pricey but it lasts a long time and I use it every morning. Don&#x27;t know if it really reduces wrinkles and fine lines but it does keep my face very soft and supple looking.</li>
    <li> liked this cream...would buy again</li>
    <li> I use this at night.  It is very thick and takes a little bit of time to fully absorb.  You can really smell the coconut oil in it.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is helpful in diminishing any wrinkles, I&#x27;ve not seen any real diminishing but it is a nice rich moisturizer and I like it for that.  Plus, I like the organic aspect and I know coconut oil is really good for your skin.</li>
    <li> Finally a make up that does not have alot of bad ingredients. The smell alone is worth the price. I really noticed a difference in the first 5 days !</li>
    <li> Love, love , love it.  Your skin looks and feels smoother. I Iam hooked on it  and you will be too.</li>
    <li> Love these products!  I have been using them for years now and they really make my skin feel great!</li>
    <li> Love this product, arrived perfectly sealed in original box. Smells wonderful and works well with combination skin</li>
    <li> My favorite moisturizer ever.  It is so awesome that I can get a good price here, but if I couldn&#x27;t I&#x27;d still buy it occasionally.  I never have skin problems when using this product, my face is light, clear, moisturized.  Great product!! Eminence all together has all great products.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer.  Not greasy.  Absorbs into skin.  Mild nice smell.  Always like to get a great well known product at a discount.</li>
    <li> Love it and fragrance is yummy</li>
    <li> I have just started using this cream, but I really like it so far. Very rich--a little bit goes a long way, and smells great!</li>
    <li> Feels and smells great. Good for my face, but I have not noticed any improvement in my skin. I&#x27;m sure there are a lot of products that are just as good and are much less expensive.</li>
    <li> Definitely a thicker product but if you dont use a lot you can get by using it in the summer time. It smells amazing and does a great job moisturizing. Dont know how it does it with age corrective but I do feel it helps heal any scars.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer, and have used before.  However I do not like when it&#x27;s already been opened.</li>
    <li> Best mosturizer I have ever owned and I&#x27;m a picky skin care person. It smells amazing but more importantly it has made my skin look more supple and reduced some fine lines.</li>
    <li> Love it! Been using it for 3 yrs. am &amp; pm. It smells and feels wonderful!</li>
    <li> This cream has improved my skins elasticity, moisture and toned down my redness from Rosacea. Love this brand!</li>
    <li> This cream leaves my skin soft and silky when I need extra hydration. I took a star off because the smell of toasted coconut is way too strong on this product for my taste. This cream will last a long time because you only need a bit of it to make your skin feel great. If you don&#x27;t mind coconut smell I highly recommend this cream, but it would be more for very dry skins or skin needing extra moisture in the winter.</li>
    <li> It is very thick, but works wonders.  Feels heavy and &amp;#34;sweaty&amp;#34; for the first 5 minutes or so after applying, but that disappears as it soaks in.  Lasts all day keeping face soft &amp; moist.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Such an awesome moisturizer!  A little goes a very long way, the moisturizer is a lovely hydrating product, and organic.</li>
    <li> Very nice product, goes and smoothly, very emollient without being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Have only used this product for a few weeks, so will see how effective this&lt;br /&gt;product actually is.</li>
    <li> I have been using Eminence Organic Coconut Age Corrective Moisturizer for about 3 weeks now and I&#x27;ve noticed a few changes. My skin is smoother and not so dry. My skin is sensitive and with this product I don&#x27;t have a red blotchy face. Last but not least my skin feels tighter. Oh one more thing I almost forgot...it smells so good.</li>
    <li> Too rich for my skin left I face greasy and I got pimples once in a while</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer.  I am 47, with temperamental skin and I have been very impressed with this cream.  It has a pleasant, coconut scent, it moisturizes without leaving an oily residue.  it is absorbed easily and does not clog my pores.  I also seems to improve fine lines.  I like it so well that I have ordered some other products by Eminence, to try.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin, and this feels WONDERFUL.  With no sunscreen, I have to double up, but the moisturization is worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is my imagination, or if it just really works well, but my skin does look better.</li>
    <li> With this product a little goes a long way , and you can see it soaking in!  Teamed with Eminence Stone Crop Gel Wash (for me) it is an excellent combination.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing! I am loving it and it goes on nicely. I always pat it on and let it soak in because it is so condensed that the product stays on for a little bit longer than most lotions. I would recommend this product and brand to everyone. It is so amazing and it makes my skin feel so soft!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give this product 5 stars, but it is kind of smelly.  I love the way my skin feels however.</li>
    <li> The product was delivered fast but it was opened.I&#x27;ve been using Eminenece organic coconut cream for 2yeras I love it so much this one smells like vinilla and the color is old.They gave me the overstock product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Best product I ever used</li>
    <li> Love the smell! I would say it is a light/medium moisturizer since I have dry skin</li>
    <li> I have combination/dry skin and this moisturizer is perfect for it. I primarily use it as a night time moisturizer because it is on the thicker side, but I have had no issues using it in the morning/day. It does not leave my skin feeling greasy, but it does leave my skin feeling well moisturized, especially during the winter. This product does have a strong coconut scent that I initially did not like, but I have grown used to it and it does dissipate within a couple minutes. Regarding results,my skin is very moisturzed and I have seen a decrease in lines that were caused by the lack of moisture and hydration from my previous moisturizer, but other than that, I have not noticed much else because I do not have wrinkles yet.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, you can either use it in its original form for extra dry skin &amp; spot areas. I usually add a bit of water to thin it out.  A little goes a very long way.  The smell is awesome!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is thicker than I&#x27;d expected ... thicker than Eminence &amp;#34;Monoi&amp;#34; ... so I use a drop of water, which enables the product to go further.  That wasn&#x27;t my intention, but I like moisturizer to be a little thinner so this works well.  Smells YUMMY.</li>
    <li> Great for an overnight moisturizer 😍</li>
    <li> Eminence is the best!!</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer. I have very oily, acne prone skin and this product has been great.</li>
    <li> Love it! Smells great and very creamy! Makes your skin very soft and I love that it has natural ingredients!</li>
    <li> received product quickly...disappointed that jar seal was not intact...love the smell and the creaminess... Might order straight from Eminence next time... Few more dollars and the jar comes sealed !</li>
    <li> This is quite expensive but it goes on smooth and clean.  I CAN&#x27;T SAY THEIR is any age corrective properties.</li>
    <li> These products are not reliable! Eminence clearly states to salons and spas that they are not able to sell these products online. They can NOT guarantee the freshness of the product. They also can not guarantee that it is a legit eminence product. Salons will sell their old products online that don&#x27;t sell, so when you get the products it will most likely be moldy and old. HENCE THE BIG DISCOUNT!!!</li>
    <li> The product is excellent and I plan to continue using the line.  I first spotted it in a very pricey spa in Florida and sampled it.  Although I liked it, I did not want to spend the money so when I found it on Amazon for less, I purchased it.  My skin is clear and bright and moist.  I strongly recommend the product.  I also gravitate toward natural products which Eminence uses.</li>
    <li> smells fantastic, but goes on thick and somewhat greasy...</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have very dry, sensitive skin and this product has been a life saver. It feels so good to put it on, like a coating of silky emulsified deliciousness. I am very sensitive to strong perfumes but this has a very light coconut smell that is extremely pleasant and calming. I sometimes get light eczema on my face and normally wouldn&#x27;t want to put any commercial product other than vaseline or prescription creams, but somehow this cream is very soothing and seems to help! I would highly recommend this product to anyone, especially those with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> A wonderful product--Adds a brightness to your skin which makes your face more youthful looking.  I will continue to buy this product-a good investment for my skin.</li>
    <li> It is pretty thick but if thin with a couple of drops of water its works well and goes farther.  I love all of the Eminence products.</li>
    <li> I tried this because I live in a very dry climate and needed a good moisturizer for my mature skin. I find it excellent. Leaves my skin soft and not greasy.</li>
    <li> This is a great non-greasy moisturizer for any season....a small amount is all that is necessary daily....use both day and night!</li>
    <li> This product is everything it says it is.  It works great and leaves my skin looking and feeling much better.  The best product for my skin that I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Good clean product.  I have and will order it again.</li>
    <li> very good rich cream, use it every day as a foundation</li>
    <li> LOVE it!!  Very creamy and moisturizing!!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer makes my skin feel soft and smooth. A small dab is all you need.&lt;br /&gt;i will order this again.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, the feel, best product, will buy again!</li>
    <li> I love the product, but only just realized that it was not sealed. The sealing foil was stuck to the top of the lid and just fell down last night. Now I wonder if I have a true Eminence product.</li>
    <li> This is a great day cream! It is thick, so I do add a bit of water to it. I was reading that you could do that, so I tried it and I think that it helps it goes on a bit better!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer and a little will go a long way!</li>
    <li> I LOVE eminence products, yet this is not my favorite of all.  My skin looks good, but maybe a little &#x27;fuller&#x27; or &#x27;puffy&#x27;...but my favorite thing about their products is that is &#x27;sinks&#x27; into my skin...this I still feel on the surface a bit...not as bad as some other brands, but still.  It&#x27;s nice, smells great, works...but not my favorite.  Won&#x27;t toss it, but not likely to buy again, back to Naseberry.</li>
    <li> Great product. Very happy with this selection.</li>
    <li> Amazing line! Every product is fantastic. I was first introduced to the line at the Four Seasons Spa in LA. This is one of my favorite products.</li>
    <li> Eminence is a natural beauty line from Hungary. I&#x27;ve been using the line for about 8 months and love it. Products are water based so when you apply creams you add a little water or spitz your face with toner and lightly dot the main areas of your face and spread the cream. The coconut cream is rich and lush. It takes just a tiny bit so you don&#x27;t use much for each application. I use this particular cream at night with a bamboo firming fluid serum that is also water based. I&#x27;m still on my day Acai moisturizer that I&#x27;ve been using for 8 months. I&#x27;m also still using the original eye cream so you see it lasts a long time if you use that little dab and water to spread. Keeps my face fresh and soft. Like I said, fabulous products!</li>
    <li> Love Eminence, price was great, arrived when it was supposed to.</li>
    <li> great it keeps face very moisurized and will be using this product again.I like eminence products&lt;br /&gt;due to being organic.</li>
    <li> Make my skin feel better,  not too dry.  I love it.  Smell  good , like coconut,  until the  last one I used,  little different smell. But I still  enjoy using it</li>
    <li> Great products and fast delivery! Thanks!!!</li>
