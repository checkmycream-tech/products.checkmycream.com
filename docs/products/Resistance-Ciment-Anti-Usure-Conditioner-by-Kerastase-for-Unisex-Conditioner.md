      <li>Loved it!</li>
      <li>Good stuff!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had beautiful hair until 2 yeas ago when a hair dresser fried it during highlights.</li>
      <li>I am not a makeup snob; some products are great, but let&#x27;s face it, mascara is mascara and lotion is lotion.  </li>
      <li>Fair price.</li>
      <li>Loved the shine and texture of my thiny hair.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and smells really great L</li>
      <li>Amazing product.. love all these brands product!</li>
      <li>Lightweight but effective.</li>
      <li>Great for super damaged hair</li>
      <li>Some things are worth the money, i.e. good wine, good coffee, and this conditioner.  </li>
      <li>it is good and useful, i suggest my friends also use it, it is good for our hair.</li>
      <li>I have very fine and brittle hair.</li>
      <li>Since I started to use this conditioner, my hair looks and feels healthy.  </li>
      <li>Love my hair.</li>
      <li>This is a really good conditioner, not too heavy and works as an awesome detangler for those of us with longer hair.  </li>
      <li>I love the shampoo, conditioner and hair cream.</li>
      <li>I found that for my hair, the product does more drying than conditioning.  </li>
      <li>Excellent for my dry ends.</li>
      <li>The consistency of the liquid was more watery and it had a strong perfume scent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other Kerastase brand products and been marginally impressed, but not with this formula!</li>
      <li>The consistency is watery, it doesn&#x27;t de-tangle, moisturize or smooth out hair in any way.</li>
      <li>I love this whole line, my hair is healthy looking and stronger with this product line.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!!!!</li>
      <li>Today, my hair is back to it&#x27;s &amp;#34;norm&amp;#34; and I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled....</li>
      <li>The Ciment line is hard to find, but works well with my color-treated hair and smells great!!</li>
      <li>Really repaired my hair to the point that I was able to &amp;#34;downgrade&amp;#34; to the Nutriv line, hehe.</li>
      <li>Plus, the whole line is available!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny...</li>
      <li>pamper your hair with the right stuff.</li>
      <li>,i like it very much.</li>
      <li>i will be back to this review:)</li>
      <li>I have been an avid user of Kerastase products for a couple of years</li>
      <li>Leaves hair soft &amp; smooth and ready to style.</li>
      <li>I am a Kerastase loyal, I tried this to smooth out my dry ends</li>
      <li>I think it is probably great for fine hair, but I have long thick hair</li>
      <li>The price is worth every penny, the quality is impeccable and the smell adds to being totally addicted to it.</li>
      <li>price is pretty high..</li>
      <li>Im a very unsatisfied customer</li>
      <li>Kerastase is extremely expensive, and while it&#x27;s a good product, there are products with similar performance at a much more reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Love their products but this one was not worth the money.</li>
      <li>Decent product.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
      <li>So I requested a refund on 1/23 and wrote a comment saying it didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as normal and maybe the formula has changed, wanting to give the seller the benefit of the doubt.</li>
      <li>When I received this it was watered down and did not seem like the original creamy conditoner,</li>
      <li>For the last week I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner and my hair now feels much stronger.</li>
      <li>This product was more watered down than I expected.</li>
      <li>Its watery in consistency, it smells different, I had to use a TON for it to do anything when normally I barely have to use any, it didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as normal, and the bottle is different.</li>
      <li>The seller responded to my refund request on 1/24 saying the formula has not changed, they get it directly from the distributor, and they would only give me a 10% refund.</li>
      <li>Not only did I find this very unacceptable but than I received an email yesterday 1/27 saying my return request has been closed!</li>

<li> This rinse is terrible , made my hair to fall out duo to breakage, made it dary and hard.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Awesome product! Loved the shine and texture of my thiny hair.</li>
    <li> Some things are worth the money, i.e. good wine, good coffee, and this conditioner.  I am not a makeup snob; some products are great, but let&#x27;s face it, mascara is mascara and lotion is lotion.  My daughter is a hairdresser and worked at a salon that sold the Kerastase line.  I would occasionally get it and hoard it, using it once or twice a week due to the cost.  She now works at another salon.  I have made due with other brands from the grocery store and even other salons, but nothing, I mean nothing works like this.  I still use it sparingly, but when I do use it, it is indeed a good hair day!</li>
    <li> This is a really good conditioner, not too heavy and works as an awesome detangler for those of us with longer hair.  I have been an avid user of Kerastase products for a couple of years and I won&#x27;t go back to anything else!</li>
    <li> Good stuff! Really repaired my hair to the point that I was able to &amp;#34;downgrade&amp;#34; to the Nutriv line, hehe. Great for super damaged hair</li>
    <li> I found that for my hair, the product does more drying than conditioning.  Not the best Kerastase product and I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Already knew product of Kerastase. Not deceived once. Package correctly wrap, perfect.</li>
    <li> price is pretty high.. i hope it works.. so we will see whether it work or not. i will be back to this review:)</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. I have long thick hair and when I wash it ,it becomes a tangled mess. Just a small amount of this product makes my comb slide through like butter</li>
    <li> Leaves hair soft &amp; smooth and ready to style. Lightweight but effective. Easy to use and smells really great L</li>
    <li> Decent product.  Fair price.</li>
    <li> This product was not very moisturizing. Quite a bit of this had to be used I order to get any manageability.</li>
    <li> it is good and useful, i suggest my friends also use it, it is good for our hair.,i like it very much.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am a Kerastase loyal, I tried this to smooth out my dry ends and I found it to be watery and not effective.  I think it is probably great for fine hair, but I have long thick hair and it was not effective.</li>
    <li> Kerastase is extremely expensive, and while it&#x27;s a good product, there are products with similar performance at a much more reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This one is probably one of the best deals out there. The price is worth every penny, the quality is impeccable and the smell adds to being totally addicted to it. My hair dresser uses it, I use it and we never get tired of it! pamper your hair with the right stuff.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent!  My hair started to show some dryness due to my thyroid problem.  Since I started to use this conditioner, my hair looks and feels healthy.  I tried different conditioners, but did not helped the dryness. I \\&quot;love\\&quot; this product!  I highly recommend it!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 6 years or so now and the product I received seems quite different. Its watery in consistency, it smells different, I had to use a TON for it to do anything when normally I barely have to use any, it didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as normal, and the bottle is different. So I requested a refund on 1/23 and wrote a comment saying it didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as normal and maybe the formula has changed, wanting to give the seller the benefit of the doubt. The seller responded to my refund request on 1/24 saying the formula has not changed, they get it directly from the distributor, and they would only give me a 10% refund. Not only did I find this very unacceptable but than I received an email yesterday 1/27 saying my return request has been closed! Reason for the closure of your request: Health and Personal Care products (cholesterol monitors, glucose monitors, fragrances, thermometry etc.) cannot be returned. Im returning hair conditioner I believe to be a fake product! Im a very unsatisfied customer and they cannot get away with selling a fake product. I would give no stars if I didn&#x27;t have to! If you&#x27;ve never used this product you obviously would never know the difference and if you have, WELL than you would know right away that its fake so BUYER BEWARE!</li>
    <li> I have very fine and brittle hair. For the last week I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner and my hair now feels much stronger. I would highly recommend this product. Finally it feels like I could get the hair I&#x27;ve always wanted!</li>
    <li> Excellent for my dry ends. Product just as described.</li>
    <li> Amazing product.. love all these brands product!</li>
    <li> The Ciment line is hard to find, but works well with my color-treated hair and smells great!! I love the shampoo, conditioner and hair cream.</li>
    <li> excellent product. it has helped me a lot to recover my hair from all the damage. I have used kerastase for a long time now.</li>
    <li> This is the worst conditioner I have ever used, and like others have said, I am sure this is a fake.  The consistency is watery, it doesn&#x27;t de-tangle, moisturize or smooth out hair in any way.</li>
    <li> This product was more watered down than I expected. Love their products but this one was not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 5 yrs. I have bottles from authorized salons. This product I received is an imitation. The consistency of the liquid was more watery and it had a strong perfume scent. The product I was sold is definitely a cheaper product put in this bottle and passed off as kerastase. I plan to take this complaing further.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why this product coast so much, it really dried out my hair. I&#x27;ve used other Kerastase brand products and been marginally impressed, but not with this formula!</li>
    <li> This rinse is terrible , made my hair to fall out duo to breakage, made it dary and hard. I have fine dry hair. :(</li>
    <li> Loved it! The package was sealed and the product is great!&lt;br /&gt;Legit staff works wonders for my hair I do recommend it!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is a must in my hair regimen.  I love this whole line, my hair is healthy looking and stronger with this product line.  I like getting this on amazon because I often forget to get these items when I&#x27;m out and about.  Plus, the whole line is available!</li>
    <li> I have been using Kerastase for years. When I received this it was watered down and did not seem like the original creamy conditoner,</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. Love my hair. Highly recommend this product to everyone. My hair is silkyand shiny!</li>
    <li> This product saved my hair. I&#x27;ve always had beautiful hair until 2 yeas ago when a hair dresser fried it during highlights. I was devastated and had to actually turn down some television interviews.  Another hairdresser turned me on to this product and I do think it saved my hair. Today, my hair is back to it&#x27;s &amp;#34;norm&amp;#34; and I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled.... It&#x27;s worth every penny... I just wish they came in bigger sizes.</li>
