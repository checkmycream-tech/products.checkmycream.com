      <li>This will sure help your energy level.  </li>
      <li>See the book &amp;#34;The Iodine Crisis&amp;#34; for more info, or just check the comments here.</li>

      <li>and I feel better than ever.</li>
      <li>I take thyroid medicine, but the Iodoral helps make that work better.</li>
      <li>Not any more</li>
      <li>If you read on the internet, you&#x27;ll find info about taking Celtic Sea Salt in addition to them to help remove toxins from the body so these can do their job of healing many areas.  </li>
      <li>Read Dr. David Brownstein&#x27;s book on Iodine to learn more.</li>
      <li>It was like a magic bullet for me.  </li>
      <li>Happy to be able to purchase this at reasonable price.</li>
      <li>This product is purchased as part of a regiment followed by many women.  </li>
      <li>My dr recommends it for my restless legs, but I found it more helpful for my pre-menopausal symptoms.</li>
      <li>Excellent product, but suddenly in short supply.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m not so sleepy, I have more energy</li>
      <li>Reputable company.</li>
      <li>When my wife ran out of iodoral she kept insisting to reorder more.</li>
      <li>I feel much better than when I started this regimen</li>
      <li>I bought more to resupply this supplement.</li>
      <li>This one delivers, and is much more convenient than the 50 mg product.  </li>
      <li>My primary-care physician reviews my meds and supplements on every visit; so far, so good!</li>
      <li>more than punctual, and a fine product, thank you .</li>
      <li>but I can say for sure that I notice a HUGE diffrrence in myself without this</li>
      <li>Good product, fast delivery.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what do expect by taking the Iodoral, but the reviews liked promising.</li>
      <li>Easy to  swallow.  </li>
      <li>This is easy to take, tablet form, and I can feel the difference since I started taking this.</li>
      <li>Got here very quickly</li>
      <li>Based on his recommendation, I began taking Iodoral High Potency Iodine/Potassium Iodide Supplement to boost my body&#x27;s iodine levels to bring my thyroid to optimum activity.</li>
      <li>I went to Dr.&#x27;s that told me I was fine but still had hair loss, weight gain, sever mood swings with menstrual cycles out of control.</li>
      <li>Iodoral is important if anyone has an Iodine deficiency as well.</li>
      <li>It is especially important for the production of Thyroid hormones, because iodine is a central component of those hormones.  </li>
      <li>I selected the fastest free shipping for all of them.</li>
      <li>Fabulous product at a fabulous price.</li>
      <li>These tiny pills are amazing for getting your energy up!  </li>
      <li>Have used it successfully for several years.</li>
      <li>I use it along with a mild r/x to boost mine.</li>
      <li>I received the product quickly and the price could not be beaten.</li>
      <li>A very good supplement for lazy thyroid, as ordered by doctor.</li>
      <li>all the time, even after walking long distance like I have always loved to do.</li>
      <li>the color and size was different, and I seem to have more energy, it makes me wonder!</li>
      <li>This special formulation is targeted towards supporting thyroid health.</li>
      <li>This really made a huge difference in how I feel.</li>
      <li>Worth the price since one a day is all I need.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Subsequently, no public announcement of the ELIMINATION of this cost effective, proven solution for thyroid problems was ever made.</li>
      <li>After taking this supplement daily for about 6 months, I am no longer constantly hoarse, I have no trouble swallowing and best of all, I can sing again ( although I don&#x27;t have a special voice).  </li>
      <li>Product is very helpful in getting enough iodine in the right combinations, and I was happy to find it for a decent price.</li>
      <li>This seems to fit the bill for me when I get tested, I am now normal.</li>
      <li>Iodoral is a very fine, relatively inexpensive resource for reassuring that this needed element is readily available for normal thyroid function.</li>
      <li>I agree Iodine is important for the body after reading “Iodine, why you need it, why you can’t live without it” by David Brownstein, M.D.</li>
      <li>Amazon reviews have become one of the best patient-to-patient source of health information (not or less tainted by Big Pharma&#x27;s dirrty hand) on the effectiveness of relatively low-cost treatments for many diseases, illnesses, and injuries.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy, not messy, and has no taste.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
      <li>Thank you very much.</li>
      <li>These two products have helped me very much.</li>
      <li>I have been taking it for 2 weeks only, but already feel much better.</li>
      <li>Most folks don&#x27;t realize that we are very low in iodine in our diets.</li>
      <li>The company I first bought this product was out of stock, so I took my chances on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I was able to find a company with the product, but even at a lesser cost.  </li>
      <li>The fact that the Sea Salt sold in markets is not iodized as led many people to be deprived of the needed iodine that is essential for thyroid function.</li>
      <li>I felt so much better after starting on this  </li>
      <li>I can personally say that I feel better all around while taking Ioderal</li>
      <li>This is a product that I most likely will take for the rest of my life.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Been using for 3 weeks and so far I haven&#x27;t seen a big difference but will continue to use in case results need a while to kick in. I am hypothyroid and hope that this product would give me extra energy or weight loss that others claimed</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by an acquaintance who conducts studies in supplements. Based on his recommendation, I began taking Iodoral High Potency Iodine/Potassium Iodide Supplement to boost my body&#x27;s iodine levels to bring my thyroid to optimum activity. My primary-care physician reviews my meds and supplements on every visit; so far, so good! This is a product that I most likely will take for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, just as afvertised.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!  Iodine is a must!  We&#x27;ve done extensive studies on our need for Iodine and it all makes sense.  We wouldn&#x27;t be without it----daily!</li>
    <li> In today&#x27;s world it is difficult to get good quality mineral supplement.  This one delivers, and is much more convenient than the 50 mg product.  You can actually take less than fifty mg accurately.</li>
    <li> I just received this product and now trust this company, I previously ordered this from someone else and now I&#x27;m wondering if those pills were the real thing! I don&#x27;t recall iodoral being written on them, the color and size was different, and I seem to have more energy, it makes me wonder! Thank you.</li>
    <li> This product has helped me to feel like myself again.  Gone is the sluggishness and I have the energy and get up and go that I used to have!</li>
    <li> The first bottle I got of this was for 90 tablets. I had an under-active thyroid for decades and I took thyroid medication for all those years. I stopped taking the prescription, and took the Iodoral for 90 days and when I had my thyroid rechecked, for the first time in all those decades, it came back normal. This works excellent for me and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Iodoral was recommended by my doctor and I have taken it for several years and found it to be just what is needed to supplement the Armour Thyroid I take for End State Hashimoto&#x27;s. My doctor says my latest bloodwork shows my thyroid levels just where they should be.  That&#x27;s great that she says that, but how you feel is just as important as bloodwork results and I can tell you from how I feel - this product makes all the difference!</li>
    <li> Fast Delivery that met all my expectaions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product for Thyroid disorders, easy and convienant to use on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> Great product. My mom and I both take it regularly.</li>
    <li> After my daughter was injured by a vaccine she had many physical issues, including hormone imbalance, constant severe pain, Vagal nerve damage, seizures, gastrointestinal disorder, to name a few. Iodoral was slowly introduced into her diet, an 1/8 of a tablet to begin, working up to 1/2 tablet at this time. Her hormones have begun balancing out, with some pain reduction. Iodoral is important if anyone has an Iodine deficiency as well. This Iodoral supplement is a Gold Standard to meet these needs!</li>
    <li> Product very  important to my health</li>
    <li> I had a Hashimoto&#x27;s Goiter for 13 years.  This is an autoimmune system disease involving the thyroid.  After taking this supplement daily for about 6 months, I am no longer constantly hoarse, I have no trouble swallowing and best of all, I can sing again ( although I don&#x27;t have a special voice).  My doctor can barely feel my thyroid now!!!</li>
    <li> Since taking 50mg of iodoral for the past 10 months, I feel remarkably better. See the book &amp;#34;The Iodine Crisis&amp;#34; for more info, or just check the comments here. Amazon reviews have become one of the best patient-to-patient source of health information (not or less tainted by Big Pharma&#x27;s dirrty hand) on the effectiveness of relatively low-cost treatments for many diseases, illnesses, and injuries.</li>
    <li> Great product. Now that the price has come back down. Most folks don&#x27;t realize that we are very low in iodine in our diets. This seems to fit the bill for me when I get tested, I am now normal.</li>
    <li> delivered promptly and was what I expected.</li>
    <li> This is what my doctor recommends for a slow thyroid.  So the product is great.  And this price is much better than what I can buy it for locally.  The shipping was slow compared to other sellers on Amazon.  I ordered a bunch of stuff at the same time.  This had a much longer shipping window than the others and arrived last of all the products I purchased.  I selected the fastest free shipping for all of them.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my Dr. because my Iodine level was low.  After taking this product, not only did it replenish my iodine level, but I only have to take it every other day.</li>
    <li> good product, seems to be the better one on the market</li>
    <li> Many &amp;#34;health&amp;#34; care providers recommend and prescribe this form of iodine.  It&#x27;s easy, not messy, and has no taste.&lt;br /&gt;Best iodine.</li>
    <li> Just as ordered and expected</li>
    <li> potent product, only one tab needed,</li>
    <li> My dr. Recommended this to me and really helps thyroid problems. I&#x27;ve been taking this for about two years now.</li>
    <li> When I ran across this while doing research on my severe fatigue, I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles.  But I got one.  I felt so much better after starting on this  I&#x27;ve been taking it for several years now and won&#x27;t go without it.  I didn&#x27;t think about how I was depriving my body of iodine (since I use sea salt or himalayan crystal salt).  Every cell in your body needs iodine to function and it&#x27;s protective against breast cancer.  It was like a magic bullet for me.  My fatigue decreased about 80% after starting this.</li>
    <li> I have read over and over in health news and magazines that Americans do not get enough iodine in our diets due to brominated flour and depleted earth growing our veggies. This is easy to take, tablet form, and I can feel the difference since I started taking this.</li>
    <li> This was a re-order.  Since I only use pink sea salt and grind my own, I don&#x27;t get the iodine that I need. This is great for that!</li>
    <li> Read a post from a natural health expert on FB and based on symptoms I thought I needed this. Spoke with my health practioner and decided to try this with caution. I only take one daily and have seen improvement. Improved joint function, energy, reduction in hair loss.</li>
    <li> This is excllent for my wife&#x27;s health</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what do expect by taking the Iodoral, but the reviews liked promising. I have been using this product now for a couple weeks and I feel amazingly better!  I have more energy, my appetite isn&#x27;t always raging, I have gone back to my normal weight which I was not expecting. Apparently the lack of iodine was making me feel the need to eat and eat hoping I would get some energy. And now that I have the energy, I no longer want to eat all the time.</li>
    <li> Oh my, where to start I am a 50 yr. old very active female that at one time had a hyperthyroid and was treated. The fatigue, muscle pains and joint pain were starting to literally kill me. I did a bit of research and I have to tell you this is a miracle - By the 3rd day I had no pain, slept better than I can remember in years and my carb cravings were completely gone. I am quite sure that there will be more health benefits that I will notice, but as of now I am full of energy again and feel great!!! thank you!</li>
    <li> Will order this again soon!</li>
    <li> I bought more to resupply this supplement. When my wife ran out of iodoral she kept insisting to reorder more.</li>
    <li> Appears to be helping me.  Easy to  swallow.  Reputable company. I will definitely purchase again.  Don&#x27;t hesitate if you have thyroid problems.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, but suddenly in short supply.</li>
    <li> more than punctual, and a fine product, thank you .</li>
    <li> If you have to cut back on salt then you may want to consider this supplement. Your thyroid won&#x27;t function properly if your iodine levels are low, no matter how much medication you take.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because my usual supplier for this product either didn&#x27;t have it or is no longer selling it. I&#x27;ve used idoral for years. My dr recommends it for my restless legs, but I found it more helpful for my pre-menopausal symptoms. I still take it.</li>
    <li> This product is purchased as part of a regiment followed by many women.  Fabulous product at a fabulous price. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I buy it all the time.</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> These tiny pills are amazing for getting your energy up!  If you read on the internet, you&#x27;ll find info about taking Celtic Sea Salt in addition to them to help remove toxins from the body so these can do their job of healing many areas.  The body needs it.&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Brownstein has a book about &#x27;Salt Your Way To Health&#x27; and &#x27;Iodine&#x27; telling the benefits of both of these products.  I learned a lot from both.</li>
    <li> after reading a book about how everyone in US is iodine deficient and how it causes so many problems with thyroid, I ordered it. I am  hypothyroid and not on any medication. Iodoral works great to give more energy throughout the day and keep the &amp;#34;brain fog&amp;#34; off. I have been taking it for 2 weeks only, but already feel much better. Great product for those who suffer from hypothyroid!</li>
    <li> If I could only remember to take it regularly, I could post a better response. I think it does help my energy when I use it all the time</li>
    <li> Recommended by my doctor.</li>
    <li> I have used Iodoral for the past several years on recommendation from my doctor.  I use it in addition to my thyroid medication. I always order from Amazon.com as the price is better, and the service is great.</li>
    <li> This product is recommended by Dr. Brownstein. It makes a difference in my energy and I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> I received the product quickly and the price could not be beaten. The company I first bought this product was out of stock, so I took my chances on Amazon.  I was able to find a company with the product, but even at a lesser cost.  It pays to shop around.  I am very pleased  :  }</li>
    <li> I came across some info online about iodine about a year ago. I was researching natural diabetes treatments. One website claimed Iodine as a cure. Obviously this isnt the case but I decided to try it due to the many claims and positive reviews on the various issues that iodine will treat, or cure. I can personally say that I feel better all around while taking Ioderal daily.&lt;br /&gt;my blood sugar seems much more managable.&lt;br /&gt;my hair skin and nails feel stronger/healthier&lt;br /&gt;NO cyst pain in ovaries anymore, as apposed to daily stabbing pains without ioderal .&lt;br /&gt;cysts in breasts seem to shrink very slowly.&lt;br /&gt;brain fog issues definitely fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cant think of much else at the moment but I can say for sure that I notice a HUGE diffrrence in myself without this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldnt afford it for a bit and when I went without it:&lt;br /&gt;All said above reversed.&lt;br /&gt;my bloodsugar control went nuts, I ended up in the ER after a few months with DKA which can be fatal.&lt;br /&gt;I just feel sluggish without it.&lt;br /&gt;joints and muscles became stiff and sore, I am now in physical therapy for issues with my hip with no injury or surgery to provoke it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly I refuse to live without this stuff now. Most of these problems come and go as my Iodine intake comes and goes. My hip is the only issue that has not come and gone. I have gone without Ioderal 3 times in the last year and a half or so (I realize I said a year earlier, my mistake.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON: I bought this bottle for approx. $40. for 180 tablets at 12.5mg/each and as I am running low I see that the SAME bottle now costs $147. which I refuse to pay, therefore I am forced to try a different brand who claims to be identicle  and has some good reviews. wish me luck!!</li>
    <li> A very good supplement for lazy thyroid, as ordered by doctor. Tiny pill easy to take. It&#x27;s iodine and potassium, similar to the natural ones in kelp (seaweed.) I use it along with a mild r/x to boost mine. I&#x27;m told that women seem to need it more than men as we all...uh hem..... &amp;#34;mature.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Good product, fast delivery.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have been taking this since 2010 after finding that i was suffering from signs of Thyroid issues. I went to Dr.&#x27;s that told me I was fine but still had hair loss, weight gain, sever mood swings with menstrual cycles out of control. My nails and skin were dry and brittle and I was so tired all the time, even after walking long distance like I have always loved to do. I started this on advice from a friend and after a few days I could feel a difference. It can take 6 weeks to get your body to fully respond but you will start to notice your energy levels come back, your hair will stop falling out and so on. I am also going to try to take L-Tyrosine with it as I am told that it helps with stress and the negative hormone levels that can bring. Anyone who is having bad side effects of your under-active Thyroid and cant find help, take Iodroal !</li>
    <li> Been using this for several years.  Keeps the thyroid in balance.</li>
    <li> great transaction and great product</li>
    <li> Product is very helpful in getting enough iodine in the right combinations, and I was happy to find it for a decent price.</li>
    <li> Everyone needs iodine as the amount in our food and other items is 50% less than it was and this causes a lot of cancers</li>
    <li> I gave this to my friend, and according to her this supplement is very effective, she used to have iodine deficiency but it has improved since she started taking this. I&#x27;m planning to buy for me since I have thyroid problem.</li>
    <li> The only supplement my husband takes. Our lab tests showed a deficiency in iodine.</li>
    <li> Received product as advertised. I have ordered from optimox before and will continue in the future. I agree Iodine is important for the body after reading “Iodine, why you need it, why you can’t live without it” by David Brownstein, M.D.</li>
    <li> literally the best stuff on the market!!</li>
    <li> Happy to be able to purchase this at reasonable price. Have used it successfully for several years. Appreciate the reasonable price</li>
    <li> Delivered as advertised</li>
    <li> I had my doctor recommend this product to  me and have used it for a couple of years now.&lt;br /&gt;It works great for me !</li>
    <li> I had my thyroid removed due to having a goiter and lots of nodules.  Started having problems swallowing again and a doctor mentioned this product due to it helping keep nodules away.  I started using this product and now I hardly ever have a problem swallowing.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have been taking these tablets for years now and firmly believe that it has helped improve my overall general health.</li>
    <li> Product seems to help improve my thyroid function and it has helped with menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes. It was recommended by my chiropractic clinic nurse.</li>
    <li> I.ve used this product 7-8 years for low thyroid function and also helps to keep my heart in sinus rhythm</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  It helps with my Hypothyroidism and also with my fibrous breasts.  I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast delivery. Felt great since i started taking would definetly reccommend it to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;Dont hesitate trying this product</li>
    <li> good value, excellent quality</li>
    <li> We live in an era where the gourmet use of Sea Salt is de rigueur. The fact that the Sea Salt sold in markets is not iodized as led many people to be deprived of the needed iodine that is essential for thyroid function. Iodoral is a high potency supplement including the essential element iodine and potassium iodide. This special formulation is targeted towards supporting thyroid health. Each easy to swallow small tablet contains Total Iodine/Iodide 12.5 mg broken down as Iodine 5 mg, and 7.5 mg Iodide as the potassium salt results in producing 8333% of the minimum daily need. Iodoral is a very fine, relatively inexpensive resource for reassuring that this needed element is readily available for normal thyroid function. It is quality tested and reliable.

    <li> Good product. I take 2 every morning with my dissecated porcine thyroid, A,D,E,magnesium, IQ10,  selenium, serrapeptase and nattokinase. I feel much better than when I started this regimen, I&#x27;m not so sleepy, I have more energy and I&#x27;m not depressed anymore.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s been using this along with some other things, and together her problem has been under control for several years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read very good things about this product, but I&#x27;ve also read that some people have had hyper-thyroid episodes while using it. The key is to partner with your endocrinologist or health care provider and get your lab work done so that you can monitor how you&#x27;re doing. I suspect we don&#x27;t get enough iodine in our diets; however, taking this while simultaneously taking a supplemental thyroid hormone could turn out to be a dangerous experiment. Staying well and out of cardiac care requires partnering with an endocrinologist for your experimentation. The product is working well for me, but I am following the advice contained here.</li>
    <li> This product assists in the well being of thyroid and other ailments and I have always found it to be very beneficial. It is substantially less in price to buy it on Amazon.com. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> My doctor suggested I start taking this to help my thyroid. I take thyroid medicine, but the Iodoral helps make that work better. I started off taking one pill, but got terrible headaches from it.  Per Dr. Brownstein&#x27;s book about iodine deficiency, the headaches can occur due to bromide or fluoride toxicity. I took 2 tablets per day instead of 1 and the headaches immediately disappeared. The depression and lack of energy that goes with iodine deficiency is shocking. This really made a huge difference in how I feel.</li>
    <li> &#x27;received the product on time and as promised (&#x27;packaged well, etc.)... &#x27;no issues, at all!!!  I will order via this method in the future!</li>
    <li> Great product to deal with thyroid and pms or menopause.  Best to take 4 caps a day (50 mg) to see results.  Yep, not a cheap daily supplement, but it keeps me from the doctor and thus saves lots of money and time.  Plus Iodoral helps your body fight against breast and other female cancers.  Must be taken along with Cofactors Vit B2 and B3.  These two products have helped me very much.</li>
    <li> Just the thing for those who have a deficiency of iodine.  Since I am not a licensed practitioner, all recommendations are qualified and can only be considered my personal opinion.</li>
    <li> my bottle of this cost $199.99&lt;br /&gt;and  there were only 150 pills in bottle...supposed to have 180....how can i get my money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;watch out for this problem...pam liebum  liebum6@aol.com</li>
    <li> Iodine is essential for a properly functioning endocrine system.  It is especially important for the production of Thyroid hormones, because iodine is a central component of those hormones.  Iodine is needed in all of our cells.  98% of us are deficient in iodine which contributes to major diseases from thyroid and breast cancer to fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue.  I recommend this product after establishing your iodine baseline by having your iodine level tested.</li>
    <li> I take I odorless because my thyroid is low and synthetic doesn&#x27;t help a whole lot.  And American women don&#x27;t get enough iodine.  I take 1 a day and that gives me the same amount that Japanese women get.  Japanese women have a fraction of breast cancer the American women do.</li>
    <li> Anyone who has trouble with energy, sub-98.6 body temp &amp; cold hands, reproductive issues, fibrocystic breasts, breast tumors or cancer, thyr&lt;br /&gt;oid, prostate issues, or anything to do with their endocrine system should be taking this&lt;br /&gt;tasteless form of 100 year old Lugol&#x27;s solution so as to reverse or cure these issues within months. The medical  research is from the 1920s and 30s and has been forgotten, but the diseases caused by iodine deficiency have escalated through the ceiling.  Read Dr. David Brownstein&#x27;s book on Iodine to learn more.</li>
    <li> Very good for the body, will always use it.Got here very quickly and I am very thankful for the service</li>
    <li> Very reliable service and good quality of product!! We are very happy with Iodoral. As iodine is required daily for our body&#x27;s glands especially thyroid, breast, and prostrate we will be ordering more and more.</li>
    <li> Recommended to me by doctor. Works very well for my hypothyroid condition.</li>
    <li> The reason I was put on Iodoral was my thyroid was off just a little. I have been using Iodoral for about 3/4 years and didn&#x27;t know it was working until I got off of it for about 2/3 months(chg&#x27;d  Drs). I noticed my voice was getting raspy. I told my Dr. so she put me back on it.  I have been back on it about a month and see a little difference in my voice, I&#x27;ll let you know if my voice is back to normal in an other 2 months. I&#x27;m confident it will be.</li>
    <li> I started taking half a pill in the morning and could tell a difference in my energy the very first day. I now take one whole pill daily. This product literally changed my life.</li>
    <li> My Dr. recommended this and it works great.</li>
    <li> Safe, truly effective and helpful.  Worth the price since one a day is all I need.</li>
    <li> I hope it&#x27;s working. Really can&#x27;t tell.</li>
    <li> This is a repeat purchase. Eliminate prescription drugs with this supplement. Thyroid problems were common during the last century. So much so, adding iodine to food products was common practice for decades. Thyroid problems were significantly reduced to a minimum with this simple solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subsequently, no public announcement of the ELIMINATION of this cost effective, proven solution for thyroid problems was ever made. This resulted in the resurgence of thyroid issues that were solved years ago! The necessity of prescription drugs such as Synthroid (generic substitutes really don&#x27;t work) became the solution, based on the assumption that sufficient iodine was still added to our daily diets. Even the most knowledgeable allopathic MD&#x27;s are unaware of this and will be shocked if you mention it. Incidentally, thyroid problems can be the major cause of high cholesterol...which necessitate another prescription drug...Anyone surprised at this, need only to check the facts for verification. This review is based on personal experience.</li>
    <li> This will sure help your energy level.  I think most American&#x27;s need Iodine in their diet.  I know I was very deficient in Iodine.  Not any more and I feel better than ever.</li>
