### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent product.</li>
      <li>The best!!</li>
      <li>BEST MASCARA EVER.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this mascara.</li>
      <li>Awesome!!!</li>
      <li>I started using Honeybee mascara, and I&#x27;m extremely happy with Honeybee because I get no flaking ever, no smudging ever, and it stays put until I take it off at night with coconut oil and an organic baby-wipe.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is great.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product that has worked well for me.</li>
      <li>a very nice product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried SO MANY mascaras, and this one is the best for me.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly for vegan makeup</li>
      <li>All mascaras tend to clump after a while as it dries out and this is no exception, but aside from that, it provides good coverage and color.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied.</li>
      <li>All in all, this is a nice average-performing mascara.  </li>

      <li>: SO easy!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Washing Off: SO easy!  </li>
      <li>The color is ok.</li>
      <li>It never gets in the crease under my eye (ug, the smudged-raccoon look), and I&#x27;m not even sure</li>
      <li>Even then, it mostly stays on unless I squeeze my eyes shut</li>
      <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>But this is the most clumpy and flakey mascara I have ever used.</li>
      <li>This is a great mascara that has all natural ingredients.  </li>
      <li>The fact that it is cruelty free puts it over the top.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>It removes easily, yet doesn&#x27;t smudge while wearing it.</li>
      <li>It comes off easily with water, but does not smudge off during the day.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from a clean mascara, but I like it.</li>
      <li>It washes off easily with water.</li>
      <li>I also like that it is vegan, cruelty free and does not have any of the chemicals one would like to avoid in a beauty product.</li>
      <li>Great mascara and the only one that doesn&#x27;t make my eyes itch.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly without clumping and doesn&#x27;t flake off during the day.</li>
      <li>Finally I found Zuzu and I am 95% happy.  </li>
      <li>This make up is vegan and cruelty free which is why I purchased it.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell particularly strong/weird, so that&#x27;s nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have ordered it multiple times and i&#x27;m super happy with it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad that I found a mascara that doesn&#x27;t have beeswax (I&#x27;m allergic) and contains more natural ingredients.  </li>
      <li>i love that this is cruelty free, and in general I love zuzu products.</li>
      <li>It goes on well and looks great until it gets wet.</li>
      <li>It really enhances my lashes and I love that it has no animal products in it.</li>
      <li>I have been buying this mascara from Lucky&#x27;s Market, and will probably start bulk ordering it.  </li>
      <li>it dries REALLY quickly, the quickest of any mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>Makes lashes look very long and pretty came wrapped very nicely.</li>
      <li>So if you live in the desert, you will love this mascara.</li>
      <li>The first one or two of these I bought were good, but the last couple were somewhat clumpy, even after I dotted the and squeezed the brush a bit with a tissue to take off the excess.</li>
      <li>I prefer Zu Zu because it has a bigger brush which goes on more easily.  </li>
      <li>It goes on very smoothly, with no clumps, and no mess.</li>
      <li>This is easily fixed by pressing the loaded wand into a tissue, which removes any superfluous gunk and makes coverage more even.  </li>
      <li>I figure the trade off is worth it for fewer chemicals.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad to have finally found a clean mascara that works for me 100% of the time.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t come off during the day, and has the natural, non-clumpy look that I like.</li>
      <li>Every mascara product I tried left my eyes bright red by the end of the day.  </li>
      <li>I must make sure my eyelashes are completely clean and oil-free &amp; ditto for the skin surrounding, otherwise there will be smudging underneath both eyes within a few hours.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve actually never used a mascara that washed off this easily.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve actually never used a mascara that washed off this easily.  </li>
      <li>Doubtless many people prefer their brush like this; however, I simply like mine with a little more space between the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I picked this up at Whole Foods over the weekend.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear much make up, but i really like this mascara.</li>
      <li>Nice and solid; seems to do an equal job of lengthening and volumizing.  </li>
      <li>Since starting a Primal/Paleo lifestyle 8 months ago I have been searching &amp; searching for a clean mascara, and I have found none that meets all my requirements:  </li>
      <li>Properly packaged and quickly shipped.</li>
      <li>Great for those who want a natural look; probably not ideal for caked-on Tammy Faye enthusiasts.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s not a negative</li>
      <li>I am careful with the product and keep it clean</li>
      <li>I also wear ZUZU eyeliner, and it wears like crazy and comes off beautifully, so</li>
      <li>I quit using Zuzu because of smudging under my eyes starting about mid-afternoon (raccoon eyes), and I do not want to have to constantly check my makeup to see if I need to clean up smudges under my eyes.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely not the \\&quot;high performance\\&quot; type, for those who daily find themselves under scorching stage lights or perhaps do synchronized swimming in full maquillage; but it&#x27;s an adequate everyday mascara for those who are willing to make a few minor sacrifices for a more natural, paraben-free product.</li>
      <li>Irritation: I have sensitive eyes and wear contacts, and I have not experienced irritation of any kind with this mascara.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes I do have to go in with a clean brush and de-clump a little bit... but to tell the truth, I do that with every mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I began using this product when I developed sensitivities to major drug store brands.  </li>

      <li>This mascara doesn&#x27;t make my lashes look as thick as something like the famous mascara in the pink and green bottle, but it&#x27;s pretty decent coverage!</li>
      <li>So thankful to have found a natural mascara product that gives my lashes body without giving my eyes constant irritation.</li>
      <li>Produces huge lashes that look like false eyelashes and the natural formula</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little harder to clean off at the end of the day, but it won&#x27;t bother your eyes any.  </li>
      <li>For a natural mascara, this stays on really well and doesn&#x27;t smudge under my eyes which has been a problem for me in the past.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i love that this is cruelty free, and in general I love zuzu products. But in walking in the snow yesterday, I had smudges around my eyes when I got to work, that I never had with my Beauty without cruelty mascara. I also wear ZUZU eyeliner, and it wears like crazy and comes off beautifully, so I guess it is just this mascara. It goes on well and looks great until it gets wet. So if you live in the desert, you will love this mascara. I will be buying BWC again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve found yet for sensitive eyes.  Every mascara product I tried left my eyes bright red by the end of the day.  I always found myself wanting to rub my eyes out of my head.  This product is like I don&#x27;t have any mascara on.  My eyes don&#x27;t itch, but they have definition.  It&#x27;s a little harder to clean off at the end of the day, but it won&#x27;t bother your eyes any.  So thankful to have found a natural mascara product that gives my lashes body without giving my eyes constant irritation.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Makes lashes look very long and pretty came wrapped very nicely.</li>
    <li> This make up is vegan and cruelty free which is why I purchased it. The container is well made and sturdy and I anticipate the colors lasting awhile. Surprisingly for vegan makeup it&#x27;s harder than I thought it would be to remove. That&#x27;s not a negative it&#x27;s just an observation. I believe this will be my go to makeup. Very satisfied. Properly packaged and quickly shipped.</li>
    <li> This is a great mascara that has all natural ingredients.  I was looking for a product that didn&#x27;t have preservatives like parabens and I&#x27;ve tried this and the Gabriel one.  I prefer Zu Zu because it has a bigger brush which goes on more easily.  All mascaras tend to clump after a while as it dries out and this is no exception, but aside from that, it provides good coverage and color.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I have ordered it multiple times and i&#x27;m super happy with it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for years. I wanted something without harsh chemicals. Others stay on for a couple of hours and then leave me with raccoon eyes. Zuzu stays on all day without running, unless I cry my eyes out or something. Even then, it mostly stays on unless I squeeze my eyes shut tightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re sensitive to chemicals, or just want to go a little easier on the environment, I recommend Zuzu.</li>
    <li> I picked this up at Whole Foods over the weekend. I&#x27;ve been a fan of Aveda for years. But I want to transition to vegan products. The color is ok. But this is the most clumpy and flakey mascara I have ever used. I will probably toss it out.</li>
    <li> This is an average-performing vegan mascara with very few ingredients.  I was formerly using Ecco Bella&#x27;s mascara in black, which also has very few ingredients but contains parabens.  At the suggestion of some kindhearted Amazon members, I decided to try out some paraben-free vegan mascaras -- and I started with Zuzu Luxe in onyx.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Deionized Water, Carnuba Wax, Stearic Acid, Panthenol, Tocopherol Acetate, Iron Oxides, Ultramarines, Cellulose Gum, Grapeseed Extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coating Ability: Nice and solid; seems to do an equal job of lengthening and volumizing.  Great for those who want a natural look; probably not ideal for caked-on Tammy Faye enthusiasts.  I have medium brown lashes with blond tips, and this mascara covers them thoroughly.  Be careful, though: it dries REALLY quickly, the quickest of any mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.  You have about ten seconds to go in and make minute changes, de-clump, etc., before it dries completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clumping: Minor clumpage/flaking issues during application.  This is easily fixed by pressing the loaded wand into a tissue, which removes any superfluous gunk and makes coverage more even.  Sometimes I do have to go in with a clean brush and de-clump a little bit... but to tell the truth, I do that with every mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush: The bristles are thick and really close together.  Doubtless many people prefer their brush like this; however, I simply like mine with a little more space between the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye Irritation: I have sensitive eyes and wear contacts, and I have not experienced irritation of any kind with this mascara.  It doesn&#x27;t smell particularly strong/weird, so that&#x27;s nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance/Longevity: For me, the main performance differences between Zuzu Luxe and my previous vegan mascara is that Zuzu gets sort of flaky &amp; powdery after about 6 hours.  It doesn&#x27;t quite have the same lasting power as Ecco Bella&#x27;s or BWC&#x27;s vegan mascara.  (FYI, I store my tube upright and do not \\&quot;pump\\&quot; the brush.)  Also, this mascara does run if you cry -- but it does so in a weird, sticky-flake way.  At the end of the day, there are usually a few tiny black flecks beneath my lower eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washing Off: SO easy!  Comes off with eye makeup remover or just soap &amp; water, no residue.  I&#x27;ve actually never used a mascara that washed off this easily.  It does look strange, though, on the cotton ball -- again, like tiny flecks of black dirt, not like a solid smudge of liquid.  I guess that&#x27;s what happens when you take the parabens out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a nice average-performing mascara.  I took two stars off my rating for the fact that it dries so quickly upon application (difficult to go in and make adjustments) and that it flakes off after a few hours of wear.

    <li> I&#x27;m glad that I found a mascara that doesn&#x27;t have beeswax (I&#x27;m allergic) and contains more natural ingredients.  It does the job for me but some people who expect a mascara to give their lashes a lot of volume might not like it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that has worked well for me. It goes on smoothly without clumping and doesn&#x27;t flake off during the day. It washes off easily with water.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear much make up, but i really like this mascara. It goes on very smoothly, with no clumps, and no mess. a very nice product.</li>
    <li> I began using this product when I developed sensitivities to major drug store brands.  It does not flake off or irritate my eyes.  I purchased the non-waterproof product.  It comes off easily with water, but does not smudge off during the day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Zuzu mascara for some time.  The ingredients are good and it goes on easily.  What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> Since starting a Primal/Paleo lifestyle 8 months ago I have been searching &amp; searching for a clean mascara, and I have found none that meets all my requirements:  must last all day with NO smudging and flaking.  I kept my Clinique brand &amp; would only try out clean mascaras on the weekend, because without fail I would have raccoon eyes within 30 minutes.  Finally I found Zuzu and I am 95% happy.  I must make sure my eyelashes are completely clean and oil-free &amp; ditto for the skin surrounding, otherwise there will be smudging underneath both eyes within a few hours.  Even with making sure eyes are completely oil-free, every once in a while about three quarters of the way through the day I&#x27;ll check in a mirror &amp; see slight smudging under one eye or the other, and that makes me Extremely unhappy.  I&#x27;m considering going back to my Clinique when I run out of my tube of Zuzu unless I find something better...will wait and see.  UPDATE, March 3, 2015:  I quit using Zuzu because of smudging under my eyes starting about mid-afternoon (raccoon eyes), and I do not want to have to constantly check my makeup to see if I need to clean up smudges under my eyes.  I started using Honeybee mascara, and I&#x27;m extremely happy with Honeybee because I get no flaking ever, no smudging ever, and it stays put until I take it off at night with coconut oil and an organic baby-wipe.  I&#x27;m glad to have finally found a clean mascara that works for me 100% of the time.</li>
    <li> The best!! I will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> For a natural mascara, this stays on really well and doesn&#x27;t smudge under my eyes which has been a problem for me in the past. However, almost every time I use it, I get an eye infection, including one that was so severe I had to be taken to emergency room and use antibiotic ointment in my eye for 10 days. I&#x27;ve tried replacing the tubes, but nope, I inevitably will start to get a stye after just a few days of use. I am careful with the product and keep it clean so I suspect I am prone to whatever bacteria develops in products that don&#x27;t contain preservatives.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this mascara from Lucky&#x27;s Market, and will probably start bulk ordering it.  BEST MASCARA EVER.  It never gets in the crease under my eye (ug, the smudged-raccoon look), and I&#x27;m not even sure if it&#x27;s water proof, but it has never run or come off in rain, or when I&#x27;m sweating. It doesn&#x27;t clump when I put it on, and looks dark and natural. The tube is small, so I have to re-buy often, only downside (and it gets dry towards the end, but what mascara doesn&#x27;t? Maybe I&#x27;ll try adding a little saline solution to make it last longer). The fact that it is cruelty free puts it over the top.  I&#x27;ve tried SO MANY mascaras, and this one is the best for me.</li>
    <li> This has become my go-to mascara.  It is easy to apply.  It removes easily, yet doesn&#x27;t smudge while wearing it.</li>
    <li> Awesome!!! Produces huge lashes that look like false eyelashes and the natural formula does not make my eyes itchy or red at all.Perfect for people with sensitive eyes and contact lense wearers.</li>
    <li> This mascara doesn&#x27;t make my lashes look as thick as something like the famous mascara in the pink and green bottle, but it&#x27;s pretty decent coverage! I figure the trade off is worth it for fewer chemicals.</li>
