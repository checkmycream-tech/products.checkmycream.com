      <li>This is the best heat protectant I&#x27;ve ever bought!</li>
      <li>Your service was excellent.</li>
      <li>It is awesome.  </li>
      <li>this is the best thermal spray on the market</li>
      <li>I have very happy and always get my products on delivery time.</li>
      <li>I found this product a couple of years ago in a salon, and it was perfect!  </li>
      <li>Very good product, helps hold hairstyle.</li>
      <li>This product is great for thermal spray and also as a finishing spray.  </li>
      <li>It gets rid of all the fly aways and frizzies that I get at the ends of my hair.</li>
      <li>My hairdresser uses this product, so I figured it must be good quality.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>Product came in good working order and we were pleased with the timeliness of the shipment.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thrilled that they sell this on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I do not like to use products of this type without some kind of safety seal.  </li>
      <li>Works nicely as a setting lotion.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Thankfully, when I needed more (two years later...you don&#x27;t need much to get a job done, so it lasts FOREVER), Amazon had the best price.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Additional body is what I need with fine hair!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of a strong odor.</li>
      <li>Not too sure of my love of this product.</li>
      <li>but I thought this Thermal would help more to protect more with the thermal protection.</li>
      <li>Love this brand of hair products.</li>
      <li>Great product, really changed my life when I found this one.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff</li>
      <li>It makes my hair look shiny and healthy.</li>
      <li>Amazon provided me a better price on a product I love.  </li>
      <li>and this helps smooth everything out and keep away the poofy look!</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and it is not so &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>and I live in Houston where it is warm and humid</li>
      <li>I have used this product previously and have always been impressed with how it makes my hair seem so straight and smooth.</li>
      <li>I know this shouldn&#x27;t be true</li>
      <li>I first tried this product when I got it free from my hair salon</li>
      <li>A good basic thermal spray that has a smaller amount of dimethicone than most, which this will build up on the hair and make it lifeless eventually.</li>
      <li>Great product to smooth and protect hair with daily use of flat iron.</li>
      <li>Make sure to spray it lightly throughout your hair and immediately blow dry.</li>
      <li>I have always been happy with Amazon shipments, however this product arrived in a box and it had no top on the container of spray.</li>
      <li>You have to load on your hairspray to keep a tightness to the hot fresh curl.</li>
      <li>This gives me exactly what I need.</li>
      <li>This thermal spray holds curls or keeps my hair straight no matter how humid it gets!  </li>
      <li>, this product used with hot rollers keeps my hair curly all day.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t hold at all regular hair spray works better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other brands over the years and this one is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>I dont know that it costs a little more, it is worth the price.</li>
      <li>Also can control it by how much you spray.  </li>
      <li>Great for my thin hair.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a product to use when curling my straight hair to help when styling.</li>
      <li>On the first day...it sometimes makes it a tad bit to soft when you go to tease out the curl.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for years and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>i have thin fine hair and need a light weight but string styling product.</li>
      <li>I use this spray daily because it makes my hair look so much thicker than it really is.</li>
      <li>It smells too much like a standard hair spray.</li>
      <li>So I was pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I have purchased Beyond Body Thermal Spray at my professional salon.  </li>
      <li>I love this product, which is not available at beauty supply stores, only in salons.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine thin hair</li>
      <li>It was the first (and so far only) product line that would work on dry hair that I was trying to flat-iron.  </li>
      <li>I have looked high and low for it at my local salons</li>
      <li>am considering sending the bottle directly to Aquage Distribution with the seller information to find out why it&#x27;s different.  </li>
      <li>but then I had to buy it as just a few sprits seemed to protect my hair from the hot iron.</li>
      <li>It really wasn&#x27;t any less expensive, just more convenient .</li>
      <li>I live in Georgia where it is extremely humid and this product is what I use to keep the frizziness from getting unbearable.&lt;br</li>

<li> and this product made my hair feel like it was stiff and glued after I used it.</li>
<li> I have long, frizzy, thin hair</li>

<li> Not happy with this</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong</li>

<li> and I am desperate for body.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s too bad</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product is great for thermal spray and also as a finishing spray.  I have very happy and always get my products on delivery time.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have found that will actually hold a curl for hours!  You simply spray it on the strand of hair before curling it...and it locks in the curl!</li>
    <li> I found this product a couple of years ago in a salon, and it was perfect!  It was the first (and so far only) product line that would work on dry hair that I was trying to flat-iron.  And it doesnt&#x27; make your hair greasy or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, when I needed more (two years later...you don&#x27;t need much to get a job done, so it lasts FOREVER), Amazon had the best price.</li>

    <li> I read a lot of reviews about this product.. I have blonde and wavy hair. It&#x27;s thick and coarse as well and this product made my hair feel like it was stiff and glued after I used it. I know this shouldn&#x27;t be true so I&#x27;m looking for other reasons to blame the poor product on. The bottle was sticky when I received it. I prefer \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; because it leaves my hair silky and soft and not so stiff.</li>
    <li> Product came in good working order and we were pleased with the timeliness of the shipment. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have blonde, long, thin hair and I am desperate for body. I use this spray daily because it makes my hair look so much thicker than it really is. I have looked high and low for it at my local salons and I have no idea why they don&#x27;t carry it. I&#x27;m thrilled that they sell this on Amazon. Make sure to spray it lightly throughout your hair and immediately blow dry. Don&#x27;t use it on wet or damp hair. Body lasts forever!</li>
    <li> I live in Georgia where it is extremely humid and this product is what I use to keep the frizziness from getting unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x60;t keep it down 100% but without it I would have a brillo pad on my head. I use this all the time. Can&#x60;t do without it !</li>
    <li> If you want hair to stay. This is it</li>
    <li> Great product to smooth and protect hair with daily use of flat iron. It makes my hair look shiny and healthy.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my curly hair when I diffuse with the hair dryer and it provides hold and body.  It smells too much like a standard hair spray.</li>
    <li> A good basic thermal spray that has a smaller amount of dimethicone than most, which this will build up on the hair and make it lifeless eventually.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! I blow dry and straighten my hair almost every single day and this is the only protective spray ive ever found that does it&#x27;s job and isn&#x27;t greasy!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and it is not so &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;.  Also can control it by how much you spray.  Also not so sticky.  Works nicely as a setting lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff it&#x27;s too bad you can&#x27;t go into a store and purchase it, so I purchase it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses this product, so I figured it must be good quality. It is a heat protectant, but gives some body to it as well. I use it with the flat iron on shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> i have thin fine hair and need a light weight but string styling product. This gives me exactly what I need. I have been using it for years and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very good product, helps hold hairstyle.</li>

    <li> Leaves your hair feeling like hay. May be \\&quot;protecting\\&quot; it from the heat, but in the process, it&#x27;s making it feel gross (feels dirty to the touch after you use product) and look even more disgusting. Just fries your hair and makes it look like hay.  I&#x27;ve used it for a week trying to get it \\&quot;right\\&quot;...thankful for hats and cold weather right now!</li>
    <li> This product is listed as a &amp;#34;thermal styler&amp;#34;; however, what I received is a &amp;#34;sealing spray&amp;#34;.  Beware that this is advertised falsely!</li>
    <li> I have purchased Beyond Body Thermal Spray at my professional salon.  Amazon provided me a better price on a product I love.  Beyond Body provides control and volume--not stiff or sticky.  Additional body is what I need with fine hair!</li>
    <li> Love this brand of hair products.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product to use when curling my straight hair to help when styling. I was going to get their other product...working firm spray...but I thought this Thermal would help more to protect more with the thermal protection.I use a curling iron daily even on a second day of sprayed hair. I have to say that is when it helps best.....on a day 2 of a redo. It helps take a curl faster and helps protect on drying out my hair. On the first day...it sometimes makes it a tad bit to soft when you go to tease out the curl. You have to load on your hairspray to keep a tightness to the hot fresh curl. And it does have a strong chemical smell that is hard to get over!! I hope no one will smell it. It&#x27;s kind of a strong odor. Not too sure of my love of this product. Now I wish I  tried the other product Workig Spray.</li>
    <li> I love this product, which is not available at beauty supply stores, only in salons.  So I was pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon.  I have always been happy with Amazon shipments, however this product arrived in a box and it had no top on the container of spray. The cap had not come off in the box; there simply was no cap at all....not that I could find. I do not like to use products of this type without some kind of safety seal.  I did, this time, but will buy in my salon in the future.  It really wasn&#x27;t any less expensive, just more convenient .</li>
    <li> I first tried this product when I got it free from my hair salon but then I had to buy it as just a few sprits seemed to protect my hair from the hot iron. Great for my thin hair.</li>
    <li> Not happy with this it doesn&#x27;t hold at all regular hair spray works better.</li>
    <li> this is the best thermal spray on the market and I have tried a lot of them. You can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
    <li> The product is NOT the same as you can purchase in a salon.  I had a teaspoon of this bottle tested with one ordered from a Salon and they were both different in color and did not work like the one from the salon.  Additionally the &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t work properly.&lt;br /&gt;I am considering sending the bottle directly to Aquage Distribution with the seller information to find out why it&#x27;s different.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my hairstylist.  It is awesome.  Your service was excellent.</li>
    <li> This thermal spray keeps the curl and doesn&#x27;t cause burning of the hair.  Works especially well when you have not body to your hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best heat protectant I&#x27;ve ever bought! It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and provides lightweight holding.  It also protects my color-treated hair!</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair.  I use this product with a curling iron to add shape and body.  It holds the shape without adding weight and brushes out leaving no build up</li>
    <li> I have very fine thin hair and I live in Houston where it is warm and humid, this product used with hot rollers keeps my hair curly all day. Great product, really changed my life when I found this one.</li>
