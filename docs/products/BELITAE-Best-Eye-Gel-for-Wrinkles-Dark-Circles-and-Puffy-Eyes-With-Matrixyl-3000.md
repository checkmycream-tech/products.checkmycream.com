      <li>I received this product for instructional purposes in exchange for my unbiased, honest review.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not having any kind of problems with the product.</li>
      <li>I like that my concealer applies nicely over it .</li>
      <li>but I can already tell you it leaves a nice dewy, silky skin feeling.</li>
      <li>and it did not seem to absorb as great as it did on my clean skin.</li>
      <li>it has a very nice gel like consistency, you can feel the effects of the skin tightening immediately, it dries fast and has a pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the dispenser pump on top!  </li>
      <li>and I absolutely am impressed with this eye cream so far!</li>
      <li>I HAVE USED MANY, MANY EYE CREAMS, AND THIS IS THE BEST FOR GENTLE MOISTURE.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and this formula is perfect...</li>

      <li>It is very light in weight too.</li>
      <li>it is very light on the skin.</li>
      <li>This eye cream is organic and I feel very comfortable putting it around my eyes both in the morning and at night.</li>

      <li>I just turned 30 and thought it was time to start taking better care of my skin.  </li>

      <li>you can feel it working and see the results in days, I look forward to using it and keep seeing the results more and more.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of cucumber and that fact that it has a pump on top , just give it a pump or two</li>
      <li>Makes my eyes feel ok</li>
      <li>In the morning it makes my eyes look more awake to me.</li>

      <li>Love the airtight dispenser.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s a great idea because your not exposing the product to too much air and its so much more hygienic than dipping your fingers in a jar.</li>
      <li>I am glad I received a sample of this product for my review.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this cream for my wife, she use it daily. It&#x27;s been 2 weeks since then, she gets the result. She doesn&#x27;t has much dark circle around her eyes anymore, I guess I made a right choice for her.</li>
    <li> This serum is so smooth and creamy on my eyes.  As soon as I dabbed it on, did the swipe on either side of my nose, my forehead, my frown spots - you know what I mean, I could feel the difference!  I dab a little around my mouth, and some on my neck.  It&#x27;s really moisturizing without being greasy in any way.  I notice a difference in the puffiness under my eyes and the wrinkle lines especially.  I don&#x27;t think I can live without this product any longer, I hope I don&#x27;t have to! :)  I&#x27;m in LOVE with Belitae Organics - these are lifesaving!!</li>
    <li> It makes my skin feel silky. I have combination skinin some area including under eye can be dry sometimes. Belitae helpvreduce the thirsty skin feel. I like the product so far so good.</li>
    <li> okay product for wrinkles, does very little to reduce bag and circle under the eyes.</li>
    <li> I love this Anti Aging creams, not only is it really helping with my dark circles under my eyes but it helps with the puffiness. It is super simple to use it has a really cool pump on the top that you just push down and it brings up just enough cream. I have never seen one like it before and think it is really neat. You don&#x27;t need much cream and it goes on really smoothly.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the dispenser pump on top!  (Though one full pump is a little more than I need...)  Does a great job of moisturizing without feeling greasy.  My skin looks great after the week I have been using it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream for a week now and have noticed the dark circles under my eyes visibly lighter and the fine lines look less visible.&lt;br /&gt;This eye cream is like a gel. It is refreshing and hydrating. I have added this  eye treatment as part of my daily beauty routine.&lt;br /&gt;It has a light scent and it is not greasy on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;And the skin around my eyes feels much smoother and firmer.&lt;br /&gt;I am very content with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this eye cream. It really makes my wrinkles under my eyes appear less visible.</li>
    <li> I like this cream.  It goes on so smoothly and does not take a lot either. It does seem to lighten the dark circles and eliminate the puffiness and wrinkles around my eyes.  I am 81 and admittedly I am starting late, but  I am not expecting to look like I am 20, therefore small gains are good.</li>
    <li> The eye cream is thick enough I can feel even coverage after application, and thin enough it is easy to absorb. The cream leaves skin in my eye areas rejuvenated, soft, and moisturized. I love it. I dont have dark circles, but I hope long term use will reduce my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> The dispenser is a great design. The product is fragrant free which I also really like. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet to see results but the feel is nice. It&#x27;s absorbed well into the skin.</li>
    <li> In the short time that i have used the anti aging eye cream i have noticed a big difference in the dark circles around my eyes, this cream has definetly lightened them and made the area around my eyes much smoother.  it filled in the crows feet making the lines much less visible.  I would highly recommend the Anti Aging Eye Cream.</li>
    <li> I really wanted a product that was all-natural. I am glad I received a sample of this product for my review. The product is fragrant free.  It absorbs nicely in the skin and leaves your face feeling soft. It seems The result is amazing! My eyes feel nourished, soothed and pleasantly relaxed.  It&#x27;s making the skin around my eyes look nicer. I like it and was happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Well... It&#x27;s a good stuff, though I opened it and it was less than 15ml. The jar looks like for 15ml but the actual amount is less than that. I just got another cream that 15ml and it&#x27;s true size. With this gel the dark circles disappear but instead I got red around the eyes and the skin looks better when this gel is on it, doesn&#x27;t improve the skin. So, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping!  Will check in again after a while for results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a minimalist but I care about my appearance and anti-aging. I absolutely LOVE this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use two eye creams, one for treatment (this one) and one for moisture. I apply this morning under sunscreen/makeup and in the evening before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect for helping to prevent and correct upper eyelid sagging and will help to firm and correct undereye lines (bear in mind that there is some natural creasing under your eye -- nothing will correct that!) I have sensitive skin and this formula is perfect... completely non-irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m ordering my 2nd jar today. If you order you need to use sunscreen with this product. I USE THIS PRODUCT MORNING AND NIGHT FOR GENTLE, OIL FREE, HYPOALLERGENIC MOISTURE TO THE DELICATE EYE AREA. IT HELPS WITH FINE LINES AND WRINKLES. IT DOES NOT CLOG PORES. I HAVE USED MANY, MANY EYE CREAMS, AND THIS IS THE BEST FOR GENTLE MOISTURE. IT WORKS GREAT UNDER MAKEUP. I DON&#x27;T USUALLY TAKE THE TIME TO WRITE REVIEWS, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HELP OTHERS FIND AN AWESOME EYE CREAM. I AM 52, BUT PEOPLE TELL ME THAT I LOOK MUCH YOUNGER. I ATTRIBUTE MY GREAT SKIN TO The  FACIAL AND EYE PRODUCTS THAT I USE. TRY IT!</li>
    <li> It does what it supposed to do; reduces puffiness.</li>
    <li> My eyes love me for this refresher,and I thank you</li>
    <li> I really like the product. I&#x27;ve been using it about a month and I do notice a big difference in my puffiness and the overall look of my eyes.  I would definitely recommend this product and I will be purchasing again in the future.</li>
    <li> Nice facial moisturizer, but I don&#x27;t think it reduced my eye puffiness.</li>
    <li> Nice product, works great!</li>
    <li> Works great! I love this product. Smells great too.</li>
    <li> This Is a really great eye miracle. My dark circles have diminished,  I have much healthier looking eyes. I love the way it is dispensed from it&#x27;s container. So easy to use.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is awsome! I love the design of the container where you do not have to dip you fingers into the product, so germs don&#x27;t get into the jar. I am serious about eye cream or eye gel. My skin is very sensitive and my eyes are too. This eye cream is organic and I feel very comfortable putting it around my eyes both in the morning and at night. I will keep using it till the jar is empty and update the results. Love it!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, exactly as described. Recommended!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff and you can&#x27;t beat the price for such great quality.  I agree it dispenses too much more than you need so I would do half a pump down.  I use it under my eyes and for head and I can feel the difference!  Thank you</li>
    <li> Belitae Organics is an excellent eye cream. It does just as it says. I can truely say it gets rid of my puffy eyes and dark circles under them. I use on my eyelids also to tighten them up n it works. I really like this cream and being made in the USA and cruelty free is such a big bonus for me. I would recommend this cream to all women even men for the dark circles.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s o.k., did not see a difference</li>
    <li> Made eye wrinkles worse.</li>
    <li> I purchased this about 2 weeks ago and I absolutely am impressed with this eye cream so far! It has helped with the puffiness AND dark circles! It&#x27;s also smoothed my crows feet lines or as I like to call them my smile lines. I ordered this product cause it was offered as a combo with the other item I ordered and I am so glad I did! I have very sensitive skin so I have tried almost everything out there and this has been very good on my skin (eyes). I surely will continue to purchase this product and use it of course with my eye cream moisturizer (just for added moisture). Would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this cream/gel. I use contact lenses and have sensitive skin so I was concerned about using a cream around my eyes. I&#x27;m not having any kind of problems with the product. My skin feels soft and it helps with the puffiness.</li>
    <li> I am always on the lookout for new anti aging treatments. Especially for around my eye area which id definitely my problem area. This worked very well . The effects were subtle but notiecable. I havent used it long but i will definitely be continuing.&lt;br /&gt;*Given for free to review*</li>
    <li> Looking good so far I have seen results in just couple of days of trying the product. The puffiness from under my eyes are diminishing&lt;br /&gt;and looking better. I used to wear dark glasses to cover my dark baggy eyes but no more glasses for me. This product is awesome the only&lt;br /&gt;reason I am giving it 4 stars is only because I will keep updating my reviews as I go along with the product and see changes and I will note them here. This product was given to me in return of a review. Wanna stop covering up those baggy dark eyes try this product and you&#x27;ll see what difference it can make</li>
    <li> I received this product in exchange for a review.&lt;br /&gt;This eye cream helped my husband. He is always complaining about how droopy his eyes are, and how they make him look older. So, I dabbed some on the underneath of his eye for about 2 weeks and it seems to bring it to color to match his over all skin tone. It filled out some too. But, the reason for the 4 stars is because he said it was heavy, and it didn&#x27;t feel like it soaked all the way into his skin. But, I guess beauty isn&#x27;t supposed to be comfortable.</li>
    <li> As a makeup artist, I&#x27;ve used just about everything out there.  The first thing I noticed about this product was the texture.  It feels like a $90 eye cream.  I love that you push down to dispense the cream, and within days I noticed that my under eye area felt firmer and I had less crepiness.  This is a new must have.</li>
    <li> Really don&#x27;t see much difference after using about a month, and I am 49 years old. I have good skin, trying to have great skin.</li>
    <li> Very bad...made my fine lines become more noticeable! I am returning it! I think all these good opinions about this cream are paid advertising,,,how come a cream of 80$ is sold for 20? This is a big lie...this cream sucks.</li>
    <li> i dont recommend it dont waste ur $</li>
    <li> This really does help around the eyes.  I notice instant results when I use it.  Helps with the dark circles and makes my eyes look less tired.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a week specifically for my eyes and the dark circles.  The results I&#x27;ve seen is a mild tightening of the skin.  The dark areas around the inner corner of my eyes has not improved, and as for puffiness, perhaps it was slightly reduced.  I think it&#x27;s great that there are peptides which help reduce dark circles, and that the remaining ingredients are organic.  Organic ingredients are always absorbed more quickly than chemical contents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In return for my candid assessment of this product, I received a discounted price.</li>
    <li> I just started using this cream less than one week and I can see the difference in the dark circles.  My eyes are definitely much brighter.  That was my main purpose for getting the cream.  The added benefit is that I already see an improvement in firmness on my upper lids.  I&#x27;m buying a second bottle to be sure I have it on hand.</li>
    <li> Good product at a good price</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a month so far I haven&#x27;t seen any or much difference on my face .</li>
    <li> Arrived timely and makes my skin feel wonderful</li>
    <li> I really think this made a difference in my under eye area would definitely recommend !</li>
    <li> this product has good quality and it is exactly as described. There are better products like this in the market but Belitae offers better price.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream. I started using it the day I received it in the mail. It is great for the wrinkles,fine lines, dark circles and puffy eyes. I apply it twice a day and let it dry for few seconds then moisturize my skin. I can see the great difference in my fine lines. I will highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have the super sensitive Asian skin and I also have dark dark circles under my eyes, along with the puffy tired eyes. I used this eye cream in hopes of helping the circles lighten up and the puffiness decrease without breaking my skin out. The cream is great, it is gentle to my sensitive skin and I am noticing my eyes are lighter. People including my husband notices a differences and tell me I do not look so tired. Great highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I just turned 30 and thought it was time to start taking better care of my skin.  Let me just say first of all that I love the smell of this stuff!  Smells like cucumbers... And my skin has never felt smoother!  I use it once a day all over my face and neck and my skin doesn&#x27;t have those little numbs anymore.  I feel like my eyes look more awake but can&#x27;t tell you exactly has improved, and it&#x27;s not oily or greasy at all.  Some things that I have used in the past make me break out, and this doesn&#x27;t.  I don&#x27;t even use a moisturizer... This stuff does it all!!  I love it!!</li>
    <li> feels nice. no reduction in wrinkles or lines at all. just another moisturiser.</li>
    <li> I have to say this cream has a super strong cucumber smell! It&#x27;s not bad but it is powerful. I love the design and the way you dispense the product, it is definitely different. You take the clear cap off and push down on the top. (I included pictures) I have noticed more firmness in my skin so it is working. The cream itself is very light and absorbs into my skin very well. I haven&#x27;t had any greasy feeling after applying the product.  Another really nice touch that I found pretty neat is that when you open the box on the lid it says &amp;#34; You are beautiful&amp;#34; little things like that standout a lot from companies. I did receive it at a discounted price to review.</li>
    <li> This completely resurfaces your skin.</li>
    <li> Almost finished with my first jar of this and not sure I&#x27;ll buy again. No difference whatsoever despite using according to directions 2x daily. Maybe I waited too long to start!</li>
    <li> I love these cream, it got rid of the puffiness in my eyes. also my wrinkles are less visible. would recommend this to my friends</li>
    <li> This product comes in a very unique airless jar that allows you to dispense as much of the product you want by pressing on the top of the jar. I think it&#x27;s a great idea because your not exposing the product to too much air and its so much more hygienic than dipping your fingers in a jar.The size of the jar is also a generous size. Normally when I purchase eye cream it comes in a tiny jar or tube. So this should last a while. Eye creams are a very important part of my daily skin care routine because I have recurrent sinusitis which makes my eyes always puffy. This gel is light weight and absorbs into the skin well without leaving any sticky or greasy residue behind. I like that my concealer applies nicely over it . Since I&#x27;ve been using this cream my eyes have been less puffy and also more firmer nothing dramatic but I can feel the difference. It feels nice when I apply it and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or the sensitive skin around them. I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference with the dark circles under my eyes which i&#x27;m sure is to do me not using this eye cream long enough however I&#x27;m hoping with extended use I&#x27;ll notice an improvement. I purchased this at a discount, however it does not effect my thoughts and opinions.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for a couple of days. I don&#x27;t have any puffy areas under my eyes and I am hoping that my wrinkles will soften up too after using a bit longer.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product long enough to say that it has ultimately transformed my under eye area, than again all I was looking for in an eye cream was hydration, all natural, no synthetic fragrances or added preservatives/chemicals, and this is it! I&#x27;ve been using it for the past couple weeks and so far I’m amazed. My under eye area feels very hydrated and firm in the morning! It helps lighten up my dark circles, which is almost impossible for an eye cream product to do. Very gentle. My one problem is how large the pump amount is, you only need a TINY amount! I try to depress the pump about 1/3 to 1/2 of the way to conserve, but this can be tricky.</li>
    <li> I had tried more expensive creams for stores in the mall and always ended up feeling ripped off. This cream really helped lighten the dark circles under my eyes and make me feel more vibrant in photos and interacting with people. The eyes are always the first thing to give away how tired you are and as a first time Mom, I don&#x27;t like to look like I just rolled out of bed after a two hour exhaustive sleep. My make up goes on so much smoother around the eyes  now too!</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;ve had this product a little lss than a week and I love the way it eels when I put it on. It is not heavy and doesn&#x27;t dry real hard or uncomfortable. I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference yet but I am hopeful, lord knows I need to lose some saggy baggy eyes! I would recommend this product simply based on the smooth feeling and pleasant smell.  Even if it doesn&#x27;t do a lot for the luggage under my eyes it is at least great as a nightly moisturizer. Very happy so far, if I end up growing a 3rd eye from the cream I will come back and update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full Disclosure: I was offered this item at a discounted rate for my honest unbiased review.</li>
    <li> i had been chronically not getting enough sleep for the last few months and as a result i have really dark circles under my eyes. really glad i found belitae eye cream! my dark circles have really improved tremendously and more youthful as well! i like how it absorbs  very quickly and feels great going on my eyes, nice and refreshing! smells really good too! i highly recommend for the treatment of dark circles, as well for anti aging!</li>
    <li> Been using this for a week.. noticed the dark circles under my eyes lightening up &amp; my eyes are less puffy making me look less tired! would buy this product again!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for a family member, I truly notice the improvement! She is happy as well.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is amazing! I love the pump dispenser so you&#x27;ll never waste any. Also it’s so smooth &amp; refreshing. Made with all organic materials including plant stem cells, Aloe &amp; vitamin E just to name a few. Best of all this product is NOT TESTED ON AMINALS! I will definitely recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> Bought this eye gel cream for my wife, she&#x27;s been using it for few days. So far so good, she found this gel refreshing and hydrating her eyes. Will continue using this gel cream to get more result, it&#x27;s a gentle product which will suit everyone&#x27;s skin type. Definitely will buy again for the second round.</li>
    <li> This cream is awesome! Leaves skin velvety smooth and refreshed right from the start. I have only used it a couple times so I cannot say how well it gets rid of wrinkles just yet but I can already tell you it leaves a nice dewy, silky skin feeling. The only cut back is it smells a little like cucumbers-but if you like cucumbers you&#x27;re set! barely noticeable after it dries. Great buy! Will be back to review after I use it longer!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first that it was just another cream to remove dark circles  puffiness an wrinkles.  So I tried it with in a couple of day the puffiness around was beginning to fade away along with the dark circles , they were no where near as dark as they had been. I will continue to use this because it actually works, Great product</li>
    <li> I purchase these anti aging cream last Wednesday and I have to admit. I love it. These will make a great Christmas present.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Very soothing. Does not remove bags, but keeps eyes nurtured. Lovely.</li>
    <li> I really am enjoying this eye cream it has a very nice gel like consistency, you can feel the effects of the skin tightening immediately, it dries fast and has a pleasant scent. I have tried several different eye creams in the past and did not like the scent of them but this one is very pleasant!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for anyone out there to help with wrinkles, dark circles and puffiness under your eyes.  A definite must for a new parent or a parent with small children.  I seem to have dark circles and puffiness under my eyes, due to not sleeping well at night.  This product has a nice smell to it and it goes on your skin smoothly, while it is absorbed right away.  I did notice a difference the next morning and could not wait to see the results after almost a week of trying out this product.   After using this product for 3 months every night, I have seen a vast improvement in my skin.  The wrinkles that were starting to emerge on my forehead and by my eyes have disappeared completely. My skin feels smooth, soft and it has a healthy glow to it that I had not seen since before having my first child 5 years ago.   I still average about 3-5 hours of sleep every night with 3 kids under the age of 5 in our home.  This small container may be small, but it is mighty with great results over time.     I just reordered my second one recently and I could not be more satisfied with the results from this product.</li>
    <li> Everything you could ever want in an eye cream in this little jar. The texture is silky and with no fragrance, you do not have to worry about sensitive watery eyes. Here is what I love about this product, It acts as a dispenser. I can tap the center down 2-3 times and a small amount of eye cream is there for my usage. To me this says a little goes a long ways. Nothing upsets me more than wasting expensive products. Once applied there was this cooling sensation that I enjoyed very much. Allow the product to set before applying any concealer or foundation. I did try to go back over the foundation with the product and it did not seem to absorb as great as it did on my clean skin. I would like to keep this eye cream as part of my morning face. This product was purchases using a coupon and this review contains my personal experience using the eye cream.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for awhile now and I cant tell it diminish lines on my eye. I love the smell of the aloe and the cool feeling when you apply it</li>
    <li> Received this the other day and I love it! I use this after cleansing, applying toner and essence and let it dry before applying moisturizer. I really love how this can be used all over the face not just your eyes. I&#x27;ve noticed the dark under eye circles are less noticeable and look forward to seeing the results after using the product for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> This is another cream I am currently using, and I love  how it makes the eye area look and feel. I love the smell of cucumber and that fact that it has a pump on top , just give it a pump or two and there you have it. It&#x27;s not a sticky mess and dries pretty fast. you can feel it working and see the results in days, I look forward to using it and keep seeing the results more and more. awesome go to.skin care product</li>
    <li> This product did irritate the skin around my eyes, but it did not cause an allergic reaction (no itching, rash, swelling, etc). My skin felt sensitive.</li>
    <li> I was initially surprised when I received this anti-aging eye cream.  I was thinking it would be a cream, but it&#x27;s more of a gel.  I figured I would give it a try anyways and I&#x27;m glad I did.  I&#x27;ve never really found a gel product that really moisturized my skin, but this one really does.  It goes on feeling smooth and silky around my eyes.  I also like the fact that you can also use it on your face as well.  It&#x27;s also cooling and does really help reduce the puffiness around my eyes.  I am also very happy with the cap and the way you dispense the eye gel.  This let&#x27;s you get clean product out and doesn&#x27;t get germs in the product by you sticking your fingers in a bottle or jar.</li>
    <li> Works great and is perfect for my sensitive eyes. I don&#x27;t find it irritates my eyes like some other eye creams do. It&#x27;s a vegan formula so I find comfort in knowing its not any harmful chemicals. Its light and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky film feeling or leave my skin greasy. I just love the pump on top of the jar its pretty cool.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a big jar for little product.  not fair!!</li>
    <li> Works well fast shipping A+++</li>
    <li> Ran out super fast.  For the price, the amount you get is not worth it.</li>
    <li> Does what it says, it is very moisturizing and the cool gel is light and a pleasure to apply. I mistakenly ordered another product to replace this one but I will be ordering this eye cream next time.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Can&#x27;t wait to try.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff I have been using it and I feel and look younger. I use it around my eyes and don&#x27;t have puffiness or circles under my eyes. That makes me whole face look younger. I have had people ask me what have you done you look younger. I day that is my secret. It is the best thing I gave ever found because I have always had dark circles and now they are gone.</li>
    <li> Been using it for about a week. So far it&#x27;s been great. I put in on after my cleanser  in the morning. Haven&#x27;t broken out so that&#x27;s a plus. Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This anti aging eye cream is amazing! Lately I have been lacking in sleep,and I am getting puffy dark circles under my eyes.I started using this eye cream and saw a difference in less than a week.My under eye bags have gone down a bit,As well as the darker skin tone under my eyes.I will continue to use,and I am sure my skin will look even better soon!!!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a few weeks but already, I LOVE IT!  I just turned 45 and started noticing how &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; my skin looked. I have very dry skin, large pores and large crows feet...not good!  I started using this product, along with a few other organic products and I can&#x27;t believe how incredible my skin is starting to look!  Honestly, I have noticed a definite decrease in the wrinkles AND my pores truly look much smaller...I am actually starting to see that &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; I often read about healthy skin having!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ONLY complaint on this is that while it feels like there is a lot of product in the jar, it&#x27;s very deceiving!  There truly isn&#x27;t as much product as you might think..other than that...great product and I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
    <li> packed and shipped very well. Love the airtight dispenser. feels good on my eyes and noticed a difference right away.</li>
    <li> bought this for my mom, she loves it.</li>
    <li> Love that pump style of this product. The cream worked great the dark  circles under my eyes.</li>
    <li> The dispenser is a great design. The product is fragrant free which I also really like. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet to see results but the feel is nice. It&#x27;s absorbed well into the skin.</li>
    <li> Another Anti Aging Eye Cream to add to collection of skin care products. I love to try new things and this is one of them.I always like to switch things up and find the newest products or products I have not heard of. This is the first time I used this anti aging eye cream and so far it seems to be working. I have been using it in the morning and and night time.In the morning it makes my eyes look more awake to me. I also like the consistency of the gel.It glides on smoothly and drys up quickly.I found that I don&#x27;t need to follow up with a cream of my choice as per directions my skin seems to be fine after I apply this.I noticed after a few days it does get rid of my dark circles under the eyes.I actually used this over my whole face and neck even though it is a eye cream. I can use its anti aging properties all over my face. It is not scented very much which is awesome.It has a unique pump on the bottle you push down on it and after a few pumps you will see the product come up.It is very light in weight too.I am going to continue to keep using it in rotation with my other skin care products.Soo far soo good and I really like it.Shipping was very fast I was surprised of how soon I received it.</li>
    <li> Dark circles vanished in few days, love it</li>
    <li> I started using this last week..was very happy the way it really took the puffy eyes away and I am starting to see the dark circles starting to look a lot better..like how it feels..it works..</li>
    <li> I like the way this cream is dispensed.It has a slight cooling effect to my skin which feel great. But it leaves a sticky residue on my eyelids. Not sure if I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Love the jar this comes in!!! It is kinda like a big button on the top of the jar u push down and a little bit of product come through a small hole in the middle. I don&#x27;t like sticking my finger in jars because it breaks down the product faster. This is the perfecting packaging!!!! The product is amazing as well it is very light on the skin. You only need a tiny bit and your makeup goes on nicely on top of it. I have noticed my eyes to look more youthful since I started using this product!</li>
    <li> Goods you received you are very happy&lt;br /&gt;,, You are the best of the seller</li>
    <li> I just received this product recently. I have spent all weekend crying my eyes out because I totaled our only vehicle. Needless to say, when I woke up for work this morning, my eyes were super puffy. I gave this cream a try. It was easy to put on, and smelled nice. Not overwhelming like other face gel/creams. The product is organic, so I am comfortable with applying it so close to my eye, multiple times a day as the directions state. I am pleased with the results that I received from this product the first time that I used it. In the picture below, you can see the difference in the puffiness. Sorry, they are backwards. The picture on the right is from this morning around 7 AM when I woke up. The picture on the left is the same eye a few hours later. As you can see, it brought the puffiness down a lot. Yes there is makeup in the after picture, but that is just eyeliner and mascara, no concealer. This was wonderful, because I didn&#x27;t want to walk around work all day having everyone know I had been crying and start asking me what was wrong. I haven&#x27;t used this product long term, but it worked for what I needed it to do and 5 stars for that! I was able to put my makeup on after I was sure the product was dry, and I had no issues at all.  I received this product for instructional purposes in exchange for my unbiased, honest review. All thoughts are of my own.</li>
    <li> LOVE HOW THE PRODUCTS ABSORBS INTO THE SKIN ..Skin feels so soft where applied under eye circles are vanishing...love this product</li>
    <li> First, this is not a cream, but a gel, so I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s listed as a cream. Scent is subtle and application is fine but a little sticky. I got this a while ago and used it for a few weeks but saw very little, if any, change. I am in my sixties but have very few wrinkles but my main problems are bags under the eyes and slightly droopy corners. I haven&#x27;t found any eye creams, including this, that helps much with either problem.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream as it is super light and blends right in.  I use this in the evening after applying the vitamin C serum.  One thing especially nice about this is how the cream is dispensed.  You just push down on the white lid and out comes a dab of cream.  PERFECT!! So elegant.&lt;br /&gt;The product is absolutely gentle and goes right on, no rubbing on sensitive area under eye.  Get it, you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love the way it feels on my skin. Have been using for a few weeks and like how my circles have been diminishing. I dint look so tired.</li>
    <li> I like the product well enough but I don&#x27;t care for the way it&#x27;s delivered from the container.</li>
    <li> BUYERS BEWARE!! LIARS!! I tried to return this item as the advertisement says &amp;#34;money back guarantee&amp;#34;. I used it as it directed by the seller. Results to be seen in about 30-60 days. Well, after 30 days you can&#x27;t get your money back on this crap and you most certainly will NOT see any changes at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for three days. I saw a dramatic reduction of my dark circles after one use, and it keeps improving!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to say that this is an overnight miracle serum, I don&#x27;t believe that there is such a product out there. But I really do love this product. It&#x27;s cool and refreshing to my tired eyes. It makes my skin noticeably softer and more vibrant. It feels like my skin has more elasticity when the product is applied.. I absolutely love the fresh cucumber smell that it has. It makes me feel like my eyes are awake once I apply it. It&#x27;s definitely a welcome addition to my beauty regimen.</li>
    <li> Not sure what all the hype is all about. Used it for 10 Days morning/night, other products work better.</li>
    <li> I bought this for me and I really do not know as of now.  Makes my eyes feel ok everything else I use dry up my lids very badly. will have to wait and see if I am allergic to this eye cream. So far so good.</li>
    <li> Felt nice on my face but didn&#x27;t really see a difference after a month of use.</li>
    <li> Great product I will order again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had dark circles around my eyes. I&#x27;ve tried multiple products. Some were ok and some didn&#x27;t help at all. I tried this Anti aging eye cream and so far it&#x27;s working. I&#x27;m glad i was offered a chance to get this. Soif your looking for a great eye cream i would recommend getting this.</li>
    <li> If you are a mommy and lack sleep like I do. Then you know the struggle of those awful black circles and bags under your eyes. I got this stuff thinking here we go another gimick to steal my money and not work. To my shocking surprise with in a week I noticed a HUGE difference! This stuff works. Its so silky and it dried quick. Its kind of cooling and it has a nice fresh scent!</li>
    <li> Just received this so I&#x27;ll need to report back on effectiveness.  However, the air package is innovative with a pump that dispenses a perfect sized amount.  The gel doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell - just a subtle smell like cucumbers.</li>
    <li> I am thoroughly enjoying the product and will update after using consistently for a few weeks to evaluate the effectiveness  The packaging is beautiful and the pump works much better than other products I have used in the past.  It doesn&#x27;t have a gross perfumey scent which I appreciate.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I have only had the product for a few days. I can tell a difference in puffiness already, wrinkles will perhaps be minimized once I use for awhile.  I like this stuff.  Packaged nicely and the cream isn&#x27;t greasy.  I use it at night and I have had no issues with clogged pores.  I will update once I have had it for a month or so.</li>
    <li> I love it Been using it a couple of days now and it seems to be working great</li>
    <li> This is a wonder cream! It&#x27;s organic, got rid of my dark circles, and wrinkles, and puffiness!  I use it as directed, twice a day. It has a lovely smell to it. Anyone can use this product at any age. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I love the packaging of this item - no squeezing, no dipping my finger in a tub. Just press down on the outer rim circle and the perfect amount is dispensed. I have been using this every evening just before my nighty moisturizer. Leaves my eyes feeling smooth and soft. I have had bags under my eyes forever; some tightening had definitively occurred and therefore I am thrilled!!! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Pretty good, seems to diminish dark circles, mine are not too bad most days though</li>
    <li> Works great, i use it at night</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so moisturizing! I really love the way the pump works too. I can tell it&#x27;s working only after a week.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t have results yet so I guess it is OK.</li>
</ol>
