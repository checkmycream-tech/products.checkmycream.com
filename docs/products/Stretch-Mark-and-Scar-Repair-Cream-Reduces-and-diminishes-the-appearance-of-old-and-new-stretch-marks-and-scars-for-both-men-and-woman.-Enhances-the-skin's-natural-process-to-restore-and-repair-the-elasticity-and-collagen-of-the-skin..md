<li> This product arrived half full, meaning the bottle was half empty.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve put on a few pounds and with the extra weight, I got new stretch marks on my abdomen.</li>
<li> This product not only helps you physically but also emotionally and mentally.</li>
<li> and I can confidently wear a vest now without having to worry about super visible stretch marks that look awful.</li>
<li> I discovered Beauty Facial Extreme Stretch Mark Repair Cream.</li>
<li> for all those who have dry skin and have marks or scars on their skin, i think he or she should use this product.</li>
<li> After a few days the two (about an inch or two long) scars began fading and eventually essentially went away after a month of use.</li>
<li> To our surprise, after a few days of using this product, her stretch marks were already starting to go away!</li>
<li> My girlfriend had stretch marks ever since she was a teen, now we have been dating for over 5 years, and she had been embarrassed to take her shirt off and go swimming, because she has these stretch marks around her hip, she said she had tried these types of creams in the past and none of them worked, but I wanted to help her</li>
<li> Such a waste of money!</li>
<li> After only a few days of using I noticed a difference!</li>
<li> The bottle was almost exactly half empty when I opened it</li>
<li> only complaint she ever had was it&#x27;s smell.</li>
<li> It visibly reduced the appearance of the dark stretch marks and gave my skin an even complexion.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve always had stretch marks due to a sudden growth spurt combined with actively going to the gym when I was younger, they&#x27;re rather visible and it makes wearing a vest uncomfortable for me.</li>
<li> The thing about alpha hydroxy acid is that it fades discoloration and makes dark spots and marks less visible.</li>
<li> Let me tell you it&#x27;s been around half a month</li>
<li> It&#x27;s eliminating every single marks and scars from her body !!!!</li>
<li> No more rough skin, no scars.</li>
<li> she got this, and tried it for a few days.</li>
<li> stand behind their product with a 30 day, money back guarantee, so there is zero risk</li>
<li> so my stomach has a few stubborn stretch marks that nothing seems to have helped.</li>
<li> and I wasn&#x27;t convinced but after using for a few weeks I am a believer</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now</li>
<li> After having my second baby, I got really bad stretch marks.</li>
<li> It left me a really bad scar around my belly it burns when you apply it</li>
<li> it not only removes ugly marks from my body, but it also gives me confidence in myself and my body so that I want be insecure about my scars.</li>
<li> What a disappointment.</li>
<li> Give this a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
<li> don&#x27;t bother spending your money on this horrible product.</li>

    <li> After having my youngest son, I had more stretch marks than I cared to admit. I have tried many products through the years, but none worked. Some lightened them for a while, but they always were there. I discovered Beauty Facial Extreme Stretch Mark Repair Cream. I had nothing to lose, so I figured why not. I have used this for about 3 weeks tonight and am amazed! My stretch marks have faded away so much, I can barely see them!! Not only have they lightened up, they are so much softer! The price is right and the product is great!! A definite must have in my book!!</li>
    <li> To be honest I started using this product because a friend recommend it and I wasn&#x27;t convinced but after using for a few weeks I am a believer, I love this product, since I started using this my stretch marks are almost, I´m very, very happy with this and i would recommend this product 100%. Summer here I come with a stretch free body!!!.</li>
    <li> I was injured recently and I guess since I am older, my skin just doesn&#x27;t bounce back as easily. I&#x27;ve put on a few pounds and with the extra weight, I got new stretch marks on my abdomen. I know Alpha Hydroxy Acid is great for stretch marks, since it promotes the production of collagen and elastin, so I got this product.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is so much smoother! It is already diminishing my stretch marks. I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all! This was very important to me.&lt;br /&gt;They stand behind their product with a 30 day, money back guarantee, so there is zero risk and you have nothing to lose!  Give this a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now and I do see results, but the only downside is the price. For me I will pay more for something that works so I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> My husbands a Doctor and he told me there’s nothing out there that will completely remove the stretch marks that I received after pregnancy, but he looked at the ingredients in this product and gave his thumbs up that it will help to lighten the appearance. I’ve been using it now for about 7 weeks and I just purchased my second bottle because I can tell that it’s effective.</li>
    <li> Gifted this product to my friend. She had a baby 7 months ago, so gave an utility gift. She felt very happy after using this product. She saw results after some weeks. No more rough skin, no scars. Smooth rejuvenated skin. Totally a waaw feeling for her. I&#x27;m happy with the utility gift I gave...</li>
    <li> I have had three kids so my stomach has a few stubborn stretch marks that nothing seems to have helped. So I decided to give this product a try. I am so glad I did, after 2 weeks of use my stretch marks are lighter! I am pleased with the results!!</li>
    <li> This product arrived half full, meaning the bottle was half empty. What a disappointment.</li>
    <li> Looking at this product and was surprised by the HUGE number of five star reviews.  Most similar creams don&#x27;t work - it&#x27;s just not biologically possible.  So, I started to look closer at all the reviewers - ALL the reviewers I looked at gave five star reviews to ALL the products they reviewed.  Also, most reviewers had reviewed the same products.  So, something is definitely fishy.  Not saying the product does/doesn&#x27;t work, but I wouldn&#x27;t trust the reviews.</li>
    <li> It really helped me after I got over my acne.It softens my skin and I use it on a daily basis .My skin looks like a baby&#x27;s ass now. It looks healthier now and all the scars just disappeared .I am really happy with the results and definitely recommend it to everybody .My girlfriend loves me more now and so do I ,simply amazing .</li>

    <li> This thing is great it not only removes ugly marks from my body, but it also gives me confidence in myself and my body so that I want be insecure about my scars. This product not only helps you physically but also emotionally and mentally. This product is a great and the best thing to look for when trying to get rid of and body marks.</li>
    <li> Love this product. The thing about alpha hydroxy acid is that it fades discoloration and makes dark spots and marks less visible. I have used it on my face and got great results so I decided to try this product on my belly and waist. It visibly reduced the appearance of the dark stretch marks and gave my skin an even complexion. Definitely recommend this!!</li>
    <li> My mother needed a gift for Mother&#x27;s Day so I set out looking! I was in search for the best lotion I could find, to help her minimize the wrinkles she has gotten from all of her stress. I found this lotion and decided why not give it a try, I could always buy her another type if it didn&#x27;t work right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So she got this, and tried it for a few days. Every time she used it she called me, and said she loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint she ever had was it&#x27;s smell. However this wasn&#x27;t a problem since she applied it at night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Price!&lt;br /&gt;-Works Great!&lt;br /&gt;-Great design to help make it a good looking gift!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a good lotion, and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This cream is brilliant! It removes all stretch and scars like it suggests! I recommend this to anyone suffering from self esteem issues because of these issues. Thanks!</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t believe but after applying this cream all my scars have just vanished. I loved it. Some things are just too good and this is one of them. Really good. One should definitely try it once.</li>
    <li> Such a waste of money! It doesn&#x27;t even work so don&#x27;t bother spending your money on this horrible product. It&#x27;s cheap quality and it if does anything it only makes your stretch marks more noticeable than ever! It left me a really bad scar around my belly it burns when you apply it I&#x27;m never buying this again or from any of their products.</li>
    <li> This really helped my wife out ;) I noticed stretch marks and asked some friends what to do,&lt;br /&gt;One of them recommended this! I was really happy when I saw the changes.&lt;br /&gt;Certainly one of the best products!&lt;br /&gt;Works, cheap, GREAT!</li>
    <li> Wow Finally I found best cream for Scar removing, The scars are definitely still visible but many seem to be lighter or diminishing in size i&#x27;m using this scar removing cream since couple of months, Now I&#x27;m feeling really proud of my face because It is really work for me also it is work for you must try it. Recommend</li>

    <li> My girlfriend had stretch marks ever since she was a teen, now we have been dating for over 5 years, and she had been embarrassed to take her shirt off and go swimming, because she has these stretch marks around her hip, she said she had tried these types of creams in the past and none of them worked, but I wanted to help her so I was looking through Amazon for a solution and stumbled upon this outstanding product, It was a great price and had very positive reviews so, I thought she should try it out. Let me tell you it&#x27;s been around half a month and the results are outstanding!</li>
    <li> I bought this cream for my wife three months ago, and she said that the product is awesome. It&#x27;s eliminating every single marks and scars from her body !!!!&lt;br /&gt;The price is very cheap comparing to other products, and it&#x27;s so much efficient ! You should buy this if you don&#x27;t know what to buy. I really like it !</li>
    <li> After having my second baby, I got really bad stretch marks. I bought this product in hopes of a saving grace. After only a few days of using I noticed a difference! i can&#x27;t wait to see how much better it will make me look.</li>
    <li> All my skins were peeled of after I use this product. It&#x27;s been two weeks but still my skins are burning.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any allege or skin problem.</li>
    <li> After having two children this product is amazing! Get rid if old scar tissue plus the stretch marks! Put it on daily and see the results! Definitely an awesome product!</li>
    <li> for all those who have dry skin and have marks or scars on their skin, i think he or she should use this product. It is one of the best in their range. it has a unique scar treatment ingredient which helps in removing the scars. I recommend to all.</li>
    <li> As of now, this product gets 1 star from me. The bottle was almost exactly half empty when I opened it and I will be measuring it before I use it to see if I really got 6.8 fl oz or if it was a giant rip off. I&#x27;ll update my review when I try it out (and most likely finish the entire bottle within a week or two). But so far, I would not recommend it based on the price and how much product you get.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife so she could get rid of some of her stretch marks, before we bought it, we were unsure if it would work or not, but decided to give it a shot. To our surprise, after a few days of using this product, her stretch marks were already starting to go away! We were blown away by this purchase, and would recommend to anyone! It WORKS!!</li>
    <li> I decided to get this because I had some scars from surgery that ended up being more visible to others than I thought they would be.  After a few days the two (about an inch or two long) scars began fading and eventually essentially went away after a month of use.</li>
    <li> This stretch mark and scar removal cream feels so awesome on my skin! No harsh smells, and a scar on my hand is disappearing after long last. I think to get full results I&#x27;ll need to keep using it, but I&#x27;m really encouraged by what I have seen by using it for a month.</li>
