<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Stay&#x27;s put !  and makes my lashes look thicker and longer better than the Great Lash I had used for years, sorry Great last :(  It cost a lot more but because i only need one coat, it last longer !</li>
    <li> I really like the mascara , but the brush is not very good also I mascara did not arrive in any packaging which I thought was strange</li>
    <li> The best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. No clumps, makes your lashes longer and thicker.  Lasts long, your lashes will look gorgeous!</li>
    <li> Recommended to a friend and finally purchased it.  Told me that she loves this product.  She has no to little lashes and she said she has never used a product on her lashes that brought them out as well as Mally&#x27;s does.  I have to agree.  The brush and the product are top notch.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t super impressed the first four times I used this mascara. It has a very wet formula, and I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the results. However, I left it untouched for about a week and now I really like it! It definitely separates and gives me the look of volume, and no longer clumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(also seen on my blog - [...]</li>
    <li> After watching Mally on a home shopping network I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this mascara so ordered through Amazon to save a few dollars ! Well, it was all hype ! Its clumpy and very thick and didn&#x27;t at all make me look like I had long &amp; full lashes. Save your cash and head to your local drugstore ! If your looking to splurge try Dior or Lancome.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best mascara I have ever purchased. Make sure you apply it according to the directions to get the best results.  Works better than the more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Mally mascara for years and purchasing from Amazon seemed like a good idea but never again!!!!  It must be outdated mascara, dry and clumpy....DONOT purchase for Amazon.....go directly to QVC for best results!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered Mally Volumizing Mascara from Amazon because a friend recommended it.  The mascara has surpassed all my expectations.  It covers beautifully without clumpy build-up and lasts all day with no flaking or smudges.  I will recommend Mally Volumizing Mascara and Amazon to my friends and relatives - it&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mascara!</li>
    <li> the mascara lumps up.  on my lashes it looks like a big glob.  i hate it</li>
    <li> Good mascara, not as impressed as I was with the demo I had seen on TV.</li>
    <li> I really love this mascara!  The color is very black, which I like. I do wipe the wand off a little before I apply it or too much on the brush will cause my lashes to clump. The more layers you add, the more volume you get.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love, love this product. Previous, I would use at least three different mascara to achieve volume and length. I can not tell you how many countless products I have tried to find one that works. My sister gave this to me to try and what a huge difference it has made. I have thrown out all my old mascara and only have to use this one!</li>
    <li> Best mascara I have ever used. Love it.</li>
    <li> So I got this mascara as a sample in a beauty test tube. Since then I have used nothing else and will not use anything else. Lasts long. Makes my lashes look amazing. So totally worth it!!!</li>
    <li> I had commented to a friend how great her mascara looked. She raved about Mally&#x27;s mascara. I had to try for myself and am NOT disappointed. Makes your alshes full without any clumping.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara.  It stays put and I can wear it all day long.  I have never experienced running mascara with this product either.  Its the only one I use now.</li>
    <li> Volumizing to the max! Your lashes stay smooth and that amazes me. I love the results! Make your eyes pop!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I saw the infomercial on QVC.  I was expecting it to be the miracle mascara making my eyes lashes look like those girls on the anime.  I mean, it&#x27;s not a bad product, but it&#x27;s just like any other mascara out there.  It didn&#x27;t make my lashes look much longer.  It&#x27;s a bit better in that it doesn&#x27;t seem to clump as easily, but over multiple layers, still can clump.  I&#x27;m such a sucker for infomercial.... never learn my lesson.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to believe the things that Mally says about this mascara however it is really a disappointment. I would have returned it but didn&#x27;t want to bother paying more postage and wasting an envelope. L&#x27;oreal has better mascara then this one and it&#x27;s half the price, (Also waterproof which this one it not). I have gotten better results with much fuller lashes and its been waterproof with several other brands. Ulta carries lots of brands that increase volume and are waterproof for less then this one. I&#x27;m just glad that I didn&#x27;t pay what QVC was selling it for.  I do not like leaving anything remotely negative about products so I&#x27;m sorry but if this helps someone else from wasting their money, I&#x27;m happy for them. My suggestion would be to go to Walgreens you will find better quality for less. One last  note, I would like to say the the seller on this product was prompt and product was delivered in great shape.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how quickly it came after I ordered it!!  Good product. Applies softly on lashes and makes lashes glisten.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara!  I first tried it after receiving it in a sample package; it was even a full size tube!  My lashes are very sparse.  I used to use the pink and green stuff but that started getting too flaky and didn&#x27;t do as good a job as it used to.  I am amazed that even one coat makes my lashes huge, long and thick, and this has never flaked on me.  The amount in the container to true to size too and I keep thinking that it&#x27;s about time to run out but hasn&#x27;t yet and I&#x27;ve had it since September &#x27;11.  For me this is the perfect mascara and I will not waste my money on any of the other mascaras which claim to do as Mally actually does.</li>
    <li> Amazing mascara!  A co-worker actually thought I had false lashes!!! Mally is on QVC often so its always nice to see her before and afters on the show. She produces great products!!! Don&#x27;t hesitate to try!!</li>
    <li> I received this mascara from my Mom at Christmas, and I have been blown away by how amazing it is!  Usually, I have to use super waterproof mascara to avoid the dreaded raccoon eye by lunchtime.  I have combination/oily skin, and most mascaras seem to melt if I apply them on my bottom lashes.  Not this one!  I was astounded to find that this mascara stays put and does not budge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only mascara that solicited comments from my husband as well about how beautiful and long my lashes were.  The formula really clings to lashes and does not clump.  (I have only now noticed a bit of dryness/clumping after 6 months!  It&#x27;s time...  I just ordered some more...) I don&#x27;t have to sweep and sweep to get the mascara to \\&quot;show up\\&quot; on my lashes, either.  The color is rich and substantial.  EXCELLENT product!</li>
    <li> Mally products are amazing and this mascara doesn&#x27;t disappoint. It arrived quickly and as described. I love how this mascara still leaves your lashes soft but creates dark pigmented lashes with length and volume.</li>
    <li> A well respected newscaster who does makeup reviews on YouTube highly recommended this so I bought it.  It is very black, a wetter formula, but it clumps on the 2nd coat and it made the tip of my lashes curl downward, very strange.  So since I have this &amp; don&#x27;t want to waste, I use my fav Elizabeth Arden Double Density Maximum Volume Mascara for the first coat to coat every lash, then I carefully use Mally&#x27;s onto the lash base &amp; up onto the lashes, trying not to apply on the lash ends cuz somehow it causes reverse lash curl downward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you have super curled upward lashes, it might work for you...but I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I find this mascara great. It lengthens, adds volume, separates and you only need two coats.  It looks so natural.  It doesn&#x27;t clump, look cakey or fuzzy like spider legs.  It stays on all day, until you take it off. It&#x27;s a rich black color.  The lashes don&#x27;t get stiff.  Very natural look and feel. I really like the formula. It&#x27;s not wet and clumpy coming out of the tube. It doesn&#x27;t create that excess, smearing all over the entrance of the mascara cylinder. I&#x27;m a cheapie. Previously, I only bought drugstore mascara and hated spending 7. for it.  I purchased a Mally Beauty makeup kit and this mascara just happened to be included.  Now, I don&#x27;t mind shelling out for the cost of this.   It&#x27;s fantasic mascara.      To remove, use a cotton ball soaked in oil.  I like good quality castor oil, but olive or natural sesame oil works well, too.  Heck, you could probably use some canola oil. The oil will easily remove the mascara. Then just wash your face.  Everynight, using your fingertips, pat a little castor oil on your lashes...just a little and just the lashes.  Leave on while sleeping.  The castor oil will help your lashes grow.  Growth can be seen in 2 weeks. It really works.  Your lashes will grow longer.     PS;  Mally&#x27;s Eye Color Automatic Waterproof Eyeliner is very good, too. One coat coverage. It&#x27;s retractable pencil, not liquid, yet it applies with ease. Stays in place on my lower lid(waterline) and the formula is gentle.  It&#x27;s not irritating to my eyes. I can even use it on my upper lid waterline.</li>
    <li> This mascara is all it&#x27;s cracked up to be once applied. Applies easy, volumizes and lengthens. I have however stopped using it as it is near impossible to get off. I take my make up off every night and do not like to spend more than 10 minutes doing so. I soak my eyes and this still does not soften, than you have to tug with eye make up remover to even get it to budge.</li>
    <li> This mascara helps create the look of gorgeous, full, luxurious lashes.</li>
    <li> I have tried dozens of other mascaras but keep coming back to mally, theres none better. I have purchased this product from this seller a couple of times before and will continue to do so as long as they have it. Outstanding seller and service!</li>
    <li> This was recommended by a friend... and I can see why. This mascara is one of the best out there... no clumping or smearing.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping! Mally makeup is the best. I only used a trial size item before so glad I got the full size item now!</li>
    <li> I have been using this mascara for years (I always buy from another website) and it&#x27;s great! But, the one I received from here is not like the ones I get from Mally. It was already dried out! When I bought it, it also said that it came in a sealed box (it looks like they don&#x27;t put that it&#x27;s sealed on here anymore, but it did when I bought it) but all it had was a sticker they put on the tube (Mally does not put those on there). There&#x27;s no telling how old that mascara is or if it had been opened before! Completely unreliable to buy from a source other than QVC, Mally, or Ulta. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this Mascara to everyone.  It lasts until you remove it and if you have short eyelashes after applying this product your eyelashes will look like Baby Doll eyelashes.  I just love it!</li>
    <li> This is the second tube I&#x27;ve bought and I really love this!  I have fine hair and lashes and this product really makes them stand out! this mascara really gives me the volume I don&#x27;t normally have, would recommend this to anyone looking for a volumizing mascara!</li>
    <li> Mally mascara has won beauty choice award winner at qvc for two years in a row. It Won for best mascara. Some people swear by it. Mally is a makeup artist.. I think it works about like any $7 mascara you can get at walmart. Many people agree with me on that. Anytime I purchase this at qvc because it comes in a kit and saves new a ton of money. The price here is good considering It is $28 at qvc for the duo. It is not worth more than $7 bucks honestly. It lasts all day but does clump sometimes. It doesn&#x27;t make your lashes look any fuller or longer then dept store mascara.</li>
    <li> Pros: goes on smooth... no clumping&lt;br /&gt;cons: price and takes several coats for adequate coverage&lt;br /&gt;Like it but in this price range will not likely buy again</li>
    <li> I went from using black eyeliner on my upper eyelid to just using this mascara and my friends couldn&#x27;t tell!</li>
    <li> did do a good job on making lashed look good, but way to difficult to remove at the end of the day.  for this reason, I will not be buying it again.</li>
    <li> This mascara is wonderful.  Mally said when she was younger she made this mixture n it took her a few hours.  My eyes are sensitive and I have had problems in the past w mascaras making my eyes water.  Not this stuff...makes them thick long and stays on!  I use baby oil to take off my mascara and it comes off in a breeze!  Purchase this and u will c first hand what I am talking bout!</li>
    <li> I had heard many good things about this mascara, so I had to try it. Great mascara. Does not clump and really seperates my lashes.</li>
    <li> Best mascara I have ever tried! Will be buying again and again...Thank You!</li>
    <li> Mally Volumizing Mascara is fabulous.One coat works to help make lashes look long and full. My one issue is that this vendor charged much more than I have been paying at another online source but the convenience got to me and the product is superb.BTW the mascara stays put until it is removed  with a cleanser. All together an great find.</li>
    <li> Best mascara ever been using it for two years now!</li>
    <li> Counterfeit product. Arrived in a ziplock baggie.</li>
    <li> This product wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting. I thought that my lashes would be fuller and they aren&#x27;t. I wont buy it again.</li>
    <li> Best mascara EVER!!!&#x27;</li>
    <li> it does get dry to fast so thats the only thing i dont like about it but it will give you long lashes</li>
    <li> my grandmother bought me this product a few years ago and i loved so i still buy it all the time now! excellent product :)</li>
    <li> I gave this four stars because I am happy with this brand of mascara, and this is not my first time using it.  I find that when I first open a new tube, that I need to blot the excess mascara off the brush or there is too much, and it can glob up a little going on if I don&#x27;t.  After a few uses though the amount that comes out on the brush is fine, and each tube lasts for a month or more (although it is hard to say exactly because I always have a few tubes of mascara open).  This mascara layers well, doesn&#x27;t flake unless you sleep in it (which happens for me more often than it should), and is a true black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t happy with the packaging from this particular seller.  The tube didn&#x27;t come in the manufacturers box, but in a small. slim plastic bag sealed at one end.  I ended up using it, although I probably shouldn&#x27;t have because it could have been easily tampered with or a counterfeit.  The product ended up being similar enough to what I have bought before that I think it is legit, but still is it worth the risk to save a few bucks?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will still use this brand, but will order from another source on Amazon or elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This mascara is ok, it starts out very nice, but dries up in the tube quickly making application clumpy. Better than any dept. store mascara though.</li>
    <li> Very dry and does not go on as shown on infomercial!  Not as good as my drugstore brand. Had hopes it would be good!</li>
    <li> I saw the mascara on an infomercial and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it!  Well, it was not worth the wait.  This mascara is no better than what I buy at Macy&#x27;s.  The hype was that it would make my lashes look volumnous and long.  Not the case.  Not a fan.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mascara. I do have long lashes... but I also noticed how great it looks on my lower lashes, which are much shorter than my top lashes obv, so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m particular to this because I have long lashes because if your lashes are shorter than my lower lashes you probably just want to use falsies anyway :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it... it&#x27;s very pigmented and I think that&#x27;s why it works so well. I&#x27;m a snob when it comes to products because I have my own line of skin care products and well...  I know what ingredients do, etc, but for some reason none of the department store mascaras have ever impressed or pleased me enough to spend the extra $ on them. I&#x27;ll buy ridiculously expensive makeup/skin care items, but for some reason I love drugstore mascara best. I don&#x27;t know why, it&#x27;s just my steez. And ever since Loreal discontinued my fave mascara years ago and broke my heart I&#x27;ve never been wowed by anything... until this.</li>
    <li> It was all dried out. I think I might have liked if I could get any out of the tube :( there are no returns so I feel ripped off.</li>
    <li> Arrived in tissue paper. Was dry, flaky and sub par to say the least!! Returned</li>
    <li> I love AMAZON!! I buy all my beauty products here. The prices are Amazing!! THANK YOU</li>
    <li> I heard this was a great product. At first it seemed a little thick. You need to be careful with this. Make sure you close it tight. And sometimes excess mascara gets on the brush. Overall I like this. It easily washes off. I would but it again.</li>
    <li> This is probably the BEST mascara I have ever worn. I don&#x27;t know why I even tried finding a mascara at Sephora when I ran out of this one. It&#x27;s worth paying shipping to have decent mascara that doesn&#x27;t flake off under my eyes or irritate my contacts.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. It really adds volume and length to my eyelashes! I have purchased this product eight times.</li>
    <li> Best mascara I have found for volume and ease of application.</li>
    <li> AWESOME MASCARA! As a makeup artist with 11 years of experience...I can tell you that I have tried just about every mascara out there! This one is a great BUT what makes it so great is what people complain about the most when they first see it. This is a &amp;#34;DRY&amp;#34; texture mascara so when you first see it...it may look dried out...BUT IT&#x27;S NOT SO DON&#x27;T GIVE UP ON IT...GIVE IT A TRY! In my experience I can tell you that &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; texture mascaras are heavy so therefore weigh down lashes. An old MUA trick is to let a wet mascara sit about 1 week (without use)  after opening it so that it becomes a little more &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;. Again...NOT DRIED OUT! This mascara is a must in my kit and in my handbag!</li>
    <li> This mascara lasts forever I kid you not. I got this months ago and it is still going strong. No clumps great volume all day wear. Definitely a great investment (:</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom for Christmas and ended up using it for myself! It&#x27;s the best! It lengthens my eyelashes and stays on all day! Will buy again and again!!</li>
    <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve EVER tried!  Looks like I&#x27;m wearing false lashes.  Love!  Also super fast shipping.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mascara. It saved my lashes !!! Get this product and you will never settle for anything else again.</li>
    <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this a 5 is because the top of the tube gets a little messy, but I love the way it works on my lashes.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many mascaras over the years.  Mally&#x27;s is better then most.  Will do about the same job as any other mascara in regard to fullness and lengnth.  The thing that sets Mally apart from the others is it&#x27;s rich black color.  It has a rich, black glossy finish that I&#x27;ve never found in any other.  It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite new mascara.  It&#x27;s very light in texture and does not clump or smear at all.  I bought five of these to give for Christmas presents.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara ever!!!  No clumps, stays on and makes lashes look long and full.  Love it!!  Worth the money!!</li>
    <li> I love this Mascara. VERY volumizing. Only need two layers for a dramatic effect. No flaking, no stiffness, but gives a lift to your lashes, one that holds. If it were paraben free, honestly, I&#x27;d never ever ever buy another mascara. Its the only one that you can buy and use until its GONE because it doesn&#x27;t just dry up.. theres a lot of product in there!</li>
    <li> truly black in color; really does volumize and lengthen; can build up coats; nonirritating to my eyes but does bother my daughter&#x27;s (no odor fumes, though, so odd); doesn&#x27;t smudge off during the day and lasts overnight, too.  worth every penny, for me.</li>
    <li> I have naturally long lashes or so I thought until I used this. It&#x27;s awesome!! My lashes touch my eyebrows when I use this mascara. Love it</li>
    <li> I love this product!!  It gives me the most beautiful, full, long lashes...I&#x27;m obsessed &amp; this mascara does not disappoint.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually a cheapo when it comes to mascara, but my sister is not. She asked for a really nice mascara for her birthday, so I decided to get her this one after reading some reviews. It&#x27;s AMAZING! I had to get my own afterward, and I do not regret it. This makes my eyelashes look super long, dark, and curlier than they are (they are not because eyelash curlers are scary). It does not smudge at all during the day, and it&#x27;s really easy to remove with a makeup wipe. Even if you wear this for 15 hours straight, you will not end up looking like a raccoon at the end of the day. It&#x27;s fantastic! My only advice - the mascara does tend to clump quite a bit on the applicator, so be sure to wipe off the excess before applying.</li>
    <li> It is the best mascara in the market!!  Italian made and it makes my lashes super big.  I have used it for the last 3 years and I am not changing it.</li>
    <li> Needed new mascara, never tried mally before.. Advertising said it would not rub off, that is the kind I needed....</li>
    <li> Love Mally Mascara.  Thick, long lashes without clumps.  Great that its available Amazon Prime!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this from QVC a few months ago and found it to be very gentle on my eyes as I tend to be very sensitive when it comes to eye make-up, however, this one does it for me.  Comes off at night very easily also, and no clumping whatsoever. I highly recommend it, especially for those of you who are sensitive like me.</li>
    <li> First time I used this mascara, I noticed a dramatic difference in how it applied. After using it for a few years, I tried Jordanna, L&#x27;oreal, Almay, and a few others and loved them at first, but kept noticing it smeared under my eyes. People kept saying I looked tired, but when I wear Mally, it&#x27;s gorgeous and doesn&#x27;t flake or smear. I get compliments on my lashes ALL THE TIME. I&#x27;m not using any other mascara again.</li>
    <li> I have used this mascara for a couple of years. It creates nice long dark lashes. My lashes are separated nicely, without being clumpy.  I use this with an eyelash primer.  This definitely makes a positive difference.  Using the primer first, allows the mascara to glide on smoothly.  This mascara lasts me about five months. I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a great Vegan mascara with a &amp;#34;regular full brush&amp;#34; not one that comes with the &amp;#34;lash defining&amp;#34; plastic spikes - which had been proving problematic for me - this mascara is the answer it has a great brush, the company does no animal testing the color is intense (I have black) and it gives me a TON of volume.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Really liked this product, non clumping went on smooth. Lashes didn&#x27;t feel sticky or cakey more like natural hair.</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  Didn&#x27;t get clumpy at all and lasted quite a while.</li>
    <li> I regularly purchase this from TV shopping retailer, this one was not in a box, loose with a sticker and didn&#x27;t seem as fresh when I buy it from the TV retailer. In the future I will ONLY purchase from TV</li>
    <li> Nothing fabulous- just an ordinary mascara comparable to what you could get at a drug store. I had high hopes too, dang it. The search for the perfect mascara continues.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. It has one coat coverage and lasts all day without flaking. I think it&#x27;s a wonderful value for the price.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t get enough of this mascara.  It goes on thick, long and awesome!  Buy it - it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see anything special about this mascara at all. I used it maybe 3 times, then forgot about it, going back to my drugstore brand. Total loss for me:(</li>
    <li> Can I give no stars, hated this Mascara!</li>
    <li> The first time I purchased this mascara it worked wonderful, it made my lashes long and voluminous, so I repurchased this mascara again, excpet this time I did not like it. The tube was very dry! I think the mascara was old.</li>
    <li> Have bought this product many times... I do like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must layer lashes for full effect.  So do one eye, then the other, then back to the first eye and repeat until desired length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caution:  Can be messy/wet... clear the brush from globs and the lashes will build up and look clumpy.</li>
    <li> It really makes her eyes pop.  Good stuff. It arrived quickly and everything was as advertised.  My wife highly recommends it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this mascara! Best one I&#x27;ve used and I have used a lot of them!</li>
    <li> I would recommend everyone to give this a try.  Lasted longer than most mascaras bought at the local discount stores.</li>
    <li> This gave me a rash around my eyes. It dried out my skin. I would not recommend. I don&#x27;t have sensitive eyes. I usually use Lancôme, and will stick with that.</li>
    <li> By far, the best mascara I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This is the most natural looking volumizing  mascara I have used. It goes on extremely smooth, with no clumps. I really like the fact that it is so light weight. I have not had problems with flaking, and it removes easily with my face cleanser without pulling any lashes out. I usually use a pin to separate my lashes with other mascaras, but it has been unnecessary with this one.</li>
    <li> Not much different than drug store quality.  Probably won&#x27;t buy again for the price</li>
    <li> I love this mascara - I&#x27;m on my second tube!! I have had numerous compliments on my eyes since I started wearing it. My hair stylist just told me my eyelashes looked great and asked me what I was doing. Just two coats to apply and you&#x27;re set for the day. I don&#x27;t notice any smearing or dark circles even at the end of the night. It&#x27;s also easy to remove.</li>
    <li> Nothing amazing, regular mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the price, may as well go with a drugstore product.</li>
    <li> NOT the real product. I&#x27;ve used Mally Mascara for two years and this has definitely been tampered with. Arrived in a plastic zip lock bag rather than the original packaging. Unprofessional.</li>
    <li> There is no mascar that does what this does..&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a Mally fan for years</li>
    <li> I love this mascara, its the best, but the seller send it to me without a case or sealed, it was unpacked. I was so dissapointed.</li>
    <li> The best mascara I have ever used and will never purchase another brand as long as this is available!</li>
    <li> Mally rocks my world. This is truly the best mascara I have ever used and I don&#x27;t say this lightly because I am known to be somewhat of a mascara snob. Lasts a long time ( generous amount), makes my lashes sooooo long and pretty. Even other women have asked me what mascara I use and where to buy.</li>
    <li> Great color and staying power.  Excellent price.  Mally shadows and for that matter all Mally products stay on until you wash them off.  And no creasing, which to me is really important in cream eye shadows.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> Best mascara ever! Really lengthens lashes and stays on. No clumping either ! Love love this one, definately will reorder</li>
    <li> This is a good mascara, but not the best for the buck.  It dries out quickly, and I have used many brands.</li>
    <li> This mascara is awesome. I have had it for several months and it is still going strong! It compares nicely to Tarte&#x27;s Lights, Camer, Lashes! It really gives length without the clump. Will definitely use this again.</li>
    <li> It really does work just as I had seen on a TV shopping channel. I didn&#x27;t want to wait for them to get it back in stock, so I came to Amazon!</li>
    <li> I bought this with the Mally&#x27;s waterproof eyeliner and I adore the combo. No more raccoon eyes and my little puny lashes look fuller, longer and gorgeous. I&#x27;ve tried many, many mascara/eyeliner combos and this is, by far, the best I&#x27;ve come across.  No smudging, flaking, looking like punched me in the eyes after a night out.  It&#x27;s great.  I&#x27;m branching out and trying her other products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 56 yr. old and tired of using eyelash curlers. Didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d have to with this mascara, but I did. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Really great color and volume.  I wish it were waterproof.</li>
    <li> Listen, it doesn&#x27;t get much better than this! You don&#x27;t have to coat your lashes 10 times over to get thick lashes. Twice on top, one on bottom, boom your done, and looking gorgeous! You go girl! Flaunt those lashes!</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used!  I will purchase it over and over.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I just love this mascara!</li>
    <li> Best mascara I have ever used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lengthens, curls without an eyelash curler!  Absolutely does not smudge!  Will never be without. great product!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t live up to the hype for me.  It was too clumpy for one thing.  There are better mascaras at the local stores that cost less as well.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara it is one of my favorites.  It is a staple in my makeup routine.  I do like her other mascara as well, ginormous I think it is called, in the green tube.  I love this product for the volume and separation it gives my eyelashes.  I have went through two tubes of this and I&#x27;m pretty sure this is the only mascara I have completely used up in my entire life.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! It lengthens and thickens without clumping. But still looks natural and not fake. Thank you MALLY!</li>
    <li> The only mascara ill buy from now on for sure. Even better than tartes light camera action mascara!  I was seriously thinking about getting expensive lash extensions. Not anymore.</li>
    <li> Using this mascara was &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; for me. Not particularly good or bad. But my problem is this mascara &amp;#34;sheds&amp;#34; on me by the middle of the day, even if I just put one coat. After putting this stuff on, I&#x27;ll find little specs of mascara under and over my eyes for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I included a picture. I put on two coats of this mascara in the morning. No other eye makeup. By that night, I have black that has deeply settled into my eye crease, you can see what it looks like naturally (left) and what it looks like if you pull my eyelid up to see all the black (right). This is one way it sheds. It also seems to leave little specks of black under my eyes that I have to wipe away throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d normally give this 2 stars since it does do the job of adding black goop to eyes. But I&#x27;m giving it one star because it&#x27;s also really expensive. Hope this helps another person!</li>
    <li> it made my eyes itch and tear..I never had this experience with mascara before..it did give volume but was not worth the irritation..I threw it out..it was an expensive mistake</li>
    <li> Once in a while the packaging goes awry (once had a dry tube and once the wand moved so freely that the mascara came out too much for application) not the fault of the shipper but of the manufacturer.  I love this formula because it washes off easily but doesn&#x27;t smear during the day.</li>
    <li> I really use this almost everyday i do love it !! It does give that volume you want ...but its alittle wet n gets clumpy alittle so i gave a 4 other then that i love it !</li>
    <li> Mally make up fulfills totally what I want in make-up...long lasting, subtle, accentuating my better points while hiding the flaws.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter introduced me to Mally and I am indebted to her.</li>
    <li> One mascara is pretty much like the other, and the same is true of Mally so the difference I&#x27;m describing is relatively small, but noteworthy in any case. Mally seems heavier and creamier as it goes on.  It dries fairly fast and the lengthening is significant.  After it dries I take one of those little heated curlers and push the lashes up, holding them in place for about ten seconds.  After that, I&#x27;m good to go all day, no flaking or smearing.</li>
    <li> I should have been suspicious when these arrived in plastic bags, instead of the Mally box as usual. I&#x27;ve used Mally&#x27;s Volumizing Mascara for a very long time, and IF this had really been Mally&#x27;s Vollumizing Mascara, I would have given it the usual 5 stars, I was really sick during the holidays, so I didn&#x27;t actually open one of the tubes to use it until a couple of days ago. This is NOT Mally&#x27;s brush/wand! It wasn&#x27;t even the right formulation! iI still had some left in my old tube. I did a one eye with one, other eye with the new comparison. Is DEFINIATELY not the real stuff!!!I just got back from Ulta, doing a double check to see if Mally had changed the brush/wand on her mascara. NO, she has not!! I bought the real stuff from Ulta. I&#x27;ve thrown the stapled plastic bags away that each of these came in, and it&#x27;s now over a month since I placed the order, but I MUST protest! This had to a knock-off product!! Buyer beware, here!!! I will not feel safe about purchasing my favorite beauty brands from Amazon again. Shame on everyone involved in the!!</li>
    <li> Ive previously used the holiday edition of this product and LOVED it, however this product was very clumpy. I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara!  Makes lashes long. I get compliments all the time. Does wonders for the lashes! Best I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> The product is dryed out. For the price I paid I wanted the product to be good and useable. I am not happy with my purchase- first time since starting my shopping with amazon.</li>
    <li> Truly, I have tried every mascara on the market, from drug stores to the highest end, to mail order web sites. This stuff just flat-out works. Two coats and my lashes look thicker, longer and they aren&#x27;t brittle.&lt;br /&gt;I love this!</li>
    <li> IF you are thinking about buying this crap DONT WAIST YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!! you can get a better mascara at CVS I promise.&lt;br /&gt;FIRST: it does not give your eyelashes volume at all, it just make them darker buy same size.&lt;br /&gt;SECOND: as soon as I tried id it started burning my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;THIRD: it makes clumps&lt;br /&gt;Maybelline NY has better mascaras and you wont pay what I did for something I had to throw away....</li>
    <li> Disappointing - I was hoping this would help with my small lashes. It didn&#x27;t allow me to curl my eyelashes....even when applied after I curled my eyelashes, it straightened them out.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this mascara  for years. they make my lashes long and dark looking and keep them moist . I tried other mascara but&lt;br /&gt;keep on returning to Mally</li>
    <li> I have seen commercials and read previous ratings but I&#x27;m not to happy with product. I guess I was hoping for it to be wonderful considering the price. I have to wear another cheaper brand of mascara with this one in order to be somewhat happy with it. It is VERY wet and is easy to get on eyelids!</li>
    <li> I love love love this product! I&#x27;ve tried multiple brands in the past and Mally is by far the best. It does a great job of separating and thickening my lashes. I usually apply 2-3 coats and follow up w/ some sort of lengthening mascara. I heard a tip during a make up tutorial that using two different mascara can make your lashes more dramatic. I&#x27;d recommend purchasing Mally...you won&#x27;t be disappointed (:</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this product.  I saw it demonstrated on QVC and then bought it on Amazon.  It was the worst, it clumped and did nothing to help my lashes.  I am better off using my drugstore mascara which is sad for a product that was suppose to be so awesome.  I wish I could give it less than one star.  This is the first product I have bought on Amazon that I have been displeased with.</li>
    <li> I have worn Malle before but this tube did not feel like it had the oomph that other tubes I have had  , had.</li>
    <li> Not impressed $5 mascara is better than this</li>
    <li> I found nothing special about this mascara. It flaked and did not volumize my lashes. This company claims that this mascara is waterproof and will stay on until you take it off. Not true. Returned it and will use another brand that I have trusted for many years.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara! Such a great color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a mascara junkie and this is definitely in my top 2.  I found in comparing with other brands, you need less of this product, which means less time layering and applying, and it doesn&#x27;t clump and dry out as other products can.  I believe it&#x27;s the combination of the product and the brush itself that really make my lashes look long and full.  I&#x27;ve even been asked a few times if I had falsies on!  Another plus of this mascara is when it&#x27;s time to remove, it comes off easily unlike some of the other products I&#x27;ve tried.  I would highly recommend this mascara and always keep a fresh one ready as back up!</li>
    <li> Great mascara!!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get this mascara. I saw it on QVC and I was very impressed by what it appeared to do. I think it&#x27;s just average, not very wowed like I thought I&#x27;d be.</li>
    <li> My fav mascara so far! Leaves lashes very long, dark and defined. Better than Dior Show in my opinion. I always get compliments on my lashes and eyes since using this product</li>
    <li> Mally mascara is the best mascara I have found.  It not only stays on all day without smudging but it also lengthens my lashes!  Best buy of any mascara!</li>
    <li> I bought 2 tubes! Paid $70 dollars, and both are absolute JUNK! The little piece inside that is suppose to clean the excess gel off your brush has fallen into the tube, BOTH times.. I&#x27;m very disappointed. Ok, 1 tube may be a fluke, but both?! :/</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s make eyes look good. Your lasses look like they don&#x27;t belong to you.  The mascara made lasses long and strong.</li>
    <li> Awesome delivery and this product rocks.  I wear contacts and tend to have problems with mascara clouding and blurring my eyes at times. Mally&#x27;s mascara also doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;itch&amp;#34;. You mascara wearers know what I mean.  I&#x27;ll buy this in waterproof too for the summer I love it that much.</li>
    <li> Meets expectations as it relates to non flaking and lasting all day. Would recommend to anyone needing long lasting mascara.</li>
    <li> My lashes look amazing!</li>
    <li> It didnt quite work the way i thought it would but I definitely saw a slight improvement.  It seems o be already drying out. i dont know if I received an older tube or if this is how it is.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this -- a friend I trust raved about it as did a beauty blogger. However, I noticed when I would wear it I would have smudgy undereyes by the end of the day. At first I thought it might have been eyeliner or something, but when I tried a different mascara, I noticed the smudges were gone. Overall, I like the look the mascara gave, but it isn&#x27;t a good all-day option.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s no better than any other expensive mascara.  Not worth the extra money</li>
    <li> I have used Mally eyeliners and love them. Thought I would try the mascara. Goes on smoothly and looks nice, but after about 4hours it seems to disappear. Doesn&#x27;t smudge it just seems to flake off. I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> Never feels fully dry on my lashes</li>
    <li> best mascara ever, Fun to give to my older friends who can&#x27;t believe their lashes are visible again</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It makes your eyelashes thick and long.  Doesn&#x27;t come off with tears.  Looks as good at night as it did when you put it on in the morning, without freshening it up.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara!! I will continue to reorder...does not smudge or flake.Lasat all day and removes easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutley the best mascara!!!!</li>
    <li> This mascara doesnt flake or smudge even on lower lashes and is easy to remove. I use a lash curler first and it helps keep the curl.</li>
</ol>
