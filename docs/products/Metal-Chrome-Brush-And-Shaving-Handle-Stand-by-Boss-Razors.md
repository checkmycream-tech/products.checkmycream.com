### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The brush fits the holder perfectly without any danger of tipping.</li>
      <li>The best thing is that the wife likes it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t the best stand around by any means.</li>
      <li>Fits the shaving brush and razor just perfectly ... and looks great!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect Awesome, expect &amp;#34;it gets the job done&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Great stand.</li>
      <li>If this cup were to be elevated even 1/4&amp;#34;, it would greatly improve the functionality of this piece...</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is where this item came in, and fits the bill very nicely.</li>
      <li>It does a good job holding the shaving brush &amp; razor.  </li>
      <li>Looks good and works as advertised</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall good quality.</li>
      <li>I will return for more products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks!</li>
      <li>My brush and my razor fit great.</li>
      <li>This kind of annoys me and is part of the reason for the 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The chrome stand does what it&#x27;s supposed to - stand there &amp; look nice.  </li>
      <li>The stand&#x27;s quality is excellent, and the price is quite reasonable.</li>
      <li>: I originally bought this for my Feather Popular De Razor which fit perfectly.</li>
      <li>If you are looking car a good value stand with a light appearance, this is a option.</li>
      <li>Nice look on the counter top.</li>
      <li>I just received this, and it fit by Merkur razor and Art of Shaving brush great - much better than just leaving them on the counter top.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and it is a good price for the product.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Do note that this is not for shorter handle razors, but is excellent for brushes with larger handles as well.</li>
      <li>so it serves as a rest with the bristles touching the bottom.  </li>
      <li>, I love it - 5 stars...</li>
      <li>OK, so this may be my fault for not considering it, but the &amp;#34;tail&amp;#34; of many of my razors don&#x27;t like to say in the cup of this holder.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re going to have a razor and shave brush then you better class your bathroom up a bit.</li>
      <li>I still use the stand for most of my razors and my brush</li>
      <li>Love the product and design.</li>
      <li>If the brush holder had more distance from the razor stand it would be 5 stars.</li>
      <li>Looks to be held in place with nothing more than JB Weld.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The razor and brush fit well and look nice.</li>
      <li>The price was great, and the shipper sent it very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>We have had it for more than a month</li>
      <li>Is arguably better for the equipment and looks clean.</li>
      <li>This is pretty nice... but not for what you pay.</li>
      <li>Still not very far into this ordeal however it became very evident that in order to keep my badger brush in good shape and keep counter space uncluttered I would need a good shaving handle stand of some</li>
      <li>It still looks great and occasionally people will notice and ask about my shaving reunite, which I&#x27;m more than happy to rant about.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy, I definitely recommend.</li>
      <li>My razor and brush both stay put fine.  </li>
      <li>At first i did not think the brush would fit on this stand (van der hagen deluxe brush)</li>
      <li>great value overall.</li>
      <li>The brush rests on the counter a bit though, doesnt hang freely like the stand it came with (which got lost)</li>
      <li>Really nice chrome plating and very durable.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately this doesn&#x27;t really work for my kit, but it&#x27;s a decent quality stand and should be great if you have a short-handled safety razor.</li>
      <li>Keeps my sink area clean and neat.</li>
      <li>Husband loved the design since the brush and razor are stored on the same side.</li>
      <li>I think the narrowest part of most brushes is much narrower than this holder presumes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Seems like a lot of money for a simple chrome wire item, but it is a good value compared to others.</li>
      <li>Fits my short DE razor and brush very well and looks great.</li>
      <li>Now, they are more organized on the counter top, and the razor and brush should last longer.</li>
      <li>My razor doea not hang like some other stands I&#x27;ve seen but rest nicely in the bottom cup and top U channel.</li>
      <li>Well, like many I am newly getting into the &amp;#34;old fashioned manly&amp;#34; way of shaving with a safety razor.</li>
      <li>This stand is nice and small but offers great balance.</li>
      <li>Great little stand, does just what you would expect it to do.</li>
      <li>The stand is exactly what it says it is, but nothing special.  </li>
      <li>Does the job at a cheap price, but then it&#x27;s not like you really need a stand anyway.</li>
      <li>The brush doesn&#x27;t even fit very well on the stand either.</li>
      <li>I have standard razor and it hangs nicely.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t a big deal, but is kind of an annoyance.</li>
      <li>Clean, functional and modern.</li>
      <li>The stand looks really nice and holds my brush high enough to keep the brisstles off the counter.</li>
      <li>Now I feel like a true old man in my bathroom !!</li>
      <li>I opted for this one and its exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>This is my first stand as I am just beginning to get into safety razor shaving.  </li>
      <li>It arrived promptly and was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>It is exactly what I was looking for and met expectations.</li>
      <li>but for now...the product looks exactly as pictured.</li>
      <li>They didn&#x27;t say you had to get the hair off the badger first.</li>
      <li>Flimsy construction: tried to gingerly bend the brush side straight and the circular hanger snapped right off.</li>
      <li>While both of these might be good for most (for those not wanting to spend $$, or those that just really enjoy their shaving for the more expensive items) I fell into the middle of these categories and wanted something durable (metal) and not completely crappy</li>
      <li>/&gt;The razor side held both DE and regular cartridge razors just fine.</li>
      <li>The stand is very sturdy and feels very high quality.</li>
      <li>A very well built item and the seller of this product is very expedient in delivery.  </li>
      <li>Wish it had a place for my straight razor.</li>
      <li>Sturdy and reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>Lastly, it&#x27;s just too light and gets bumped over when removing the brush.</li>
      <li>This was exactly what I needed to hold my new Feather DE razor and badger brush.</li>
      <li>As far as the price, well, it was pretty darn reasonably priced, so 4 stars there.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s a good bit too short to keep the brush from sitting on the counter, so the brush gets a little squished into the countertop.</li>
      <li>Really contemporary looking.</li>
      <li>The razor side is too high for my Edwin Jagger DE89ibl.</li>
      <li>I love the idea of this little stand, but it&#x27;s got a couple strikes against it.</li>
      <li>Good but not great.</li>
      <li>Its a basic little stand for your razor and brush and it looks nice without being too pricy.</li>
      <li>, I like a fatter knot, and had to try 3 different stands to find one that fit, and finally this one did.  </li>
      <li>It looks classic and modern at the same time.</li>
      <li>i like the minimalist look and the entire thing is much easier to clean than any other stand would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is large enough to hold my Parker brush and Feather razor.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind too much, since my brush is cheap so a little bit of scratching isn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
      <li>This stand does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do - allow the razor and brush to air dry without standing in the dripped water.</li>
      <li>Defnitely worth the purchase, given the other options out there and the cost.</li>
      <li>When there’s an angry badger in your bathroom you want quick access to every weapon available.</li>
      <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s worth a few extra bucks to get a simpler and better product that no one else has the plain sense to make.</li>
      <li>Seems to be very sturdy and should last a while with proper care.</li>
      <li>It barely fits my shaving brush ([[ASIN:</li>
      <li>Took a long time to find a holder for my new razor and brush because all the ones I could find seemed overpriced.</li>

<li> The stand works well and should last a long time.</li>
<li> /&gt;FYI, if you have a long handled razor like my Merkur 180, it will not rest on the stand properly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is my first stand as I am just beginning to get into safety razor shaving.  A very well built item and the seller of this product is very expedient in delivery.  I will return for more products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks!</li>
    <li> The chrome stand does what it&#x27;s supposed to - stand there &amp; look nice.  It does a good job holding the shaving brush &amp; razor.  It&#x27;s not bulky.</li>
    <li> Why did I wait so long to get this? Neatens up the place. Is arguably better for the equipment and looks clean.</li>
    <li> Now I feel like a true old man in my bathroom !!</li>
    <li> Fits the shaving brush and razor just perfectly ... and looks great!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product. Nice look on the counter top.</li>
    <li> The stand looks really nice and holds my brush high enough to keep the brisstles off the counter. My razor doea not hang like some other stands I&#x27;ve seen but rest nicely in the bottom cup and top U channel. Looks good and works as advertised</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I needed to hold my new Feather DE razor and badger brush. It looks classic and modern at the same time. It arrived promptly and was exactly as described. I would definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> OK, so this may be my fault for not considering it, but the &amp;#34;tail&amp;#34; of many of my razors don&#x27;t like to say in the cup of this holder.  If this cup were to be elevated even 1/4&amp;#34;, it would greatly improve the functionality of this piece... well, that and bending the razor cradle back so there is a bit of an angle to ensure it doesn&#x27;t fall forward for any reason, but that I can do myself.  The brush side works well, I like a fatter knot, and had to try 3 different stands to find one that fit, and finally this one did.  Overall rating 4 stars, for the brush side, I love it - 5 stars... for the razor side, the cup needs to be deeper and the cradle bent back - 3 stars for that side.  As far as the price, well, it was pretty darn reasonably priced, so 4 stars there.</li>
    <li> Item is chrome plated and stands very solid.  It is large enough to hold my Parker brush and Feather razor.  Also it can double as holding two razors instead of a razor and brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall good quality.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the best stand around by any means. Either the brush hook is a little small, or my brush is a little fat, but I had to force it in a little bit. I don&#x27;t mind too much, since my brush is cheap so a little bit of scratching isn&#x27;t a big deal. Does the job at a cheap price, but then it&#x27;s not like you really need a stand anyway.</li>
    <li> This is pretty nice... but not for what you pay. This thing should cost 5 bucks tops. It&#x27;s not a piece of junk but in an era where I can get a 52 inch LCD TV for less than $500, then it seems stupid to pay $15 for a chrome wire hanger.</li>
    <li> I admit that the assumed size of the stand is my fault, but there isn&#x27;t any effort taken to prevent my misunderstanding. In fact, it seems the stand is shown in such a way as to mislead the consumer. This kind of annoys me and is part of the reason for the 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, if you have a long handled razor like my Merkur 180, it will not rest on the stand properly. The stand is too short. The brush doesn&#x27;t even fit very well on the stand either. I have to hang it where the handle meets the hair. This isn&#x27;t a big deal, but is kind of an annoyance. For 20 dollars, I expect more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than these few grievances, the stand seems like a solid piece. I only wish it was a little taller.</li>
    <li> It holds a razor, a brush, and that&#x27;s it. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s a good bit too short to keep the brush from sitting on the counter, so the brush gets a little squished into the countertop. Having to modify my brush with rubber bands to keep it supported off the countertop.</li>
    <li> This is my fault for not checking, but my brush couldn&#x27;t be held in this holder. I attempted to squeeze it ever so slightly so it could hold my brush, and the entire piece broke off. I probably could have soldered it back into place, but I came home to my regular razor and brush stand, so I no longer needed it. Once again, this was my fault for not checking and also for attempting to modify it, but it is something to keep in mind before purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor side held both DE and regular cartridge razors just fine.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re going to have a razor and shave brush then you better class your bathroom up a bit. This little stand will do the trick. I&#x27;ve had mine for over a year now. It still looks great and occasionally people will notice and ask about my shaving reunite, which I&#x27;m more than happy to rant about.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy, I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> What you see is what you get. Its a basic little stand for your razor and brush and it looks nice without being too pricy. I wanted a stand to prolong my brush&#x27;s life, but didn&#x27;t want one of the 3 dollar plastic ones, but I also didn&#x27;t want to spend 40 bucks on a fancy one. I opted for this one and its exactly what I wanted. The razor and brush fit well and look nice.</li>
    <li> The stand works well and should last a long time. It barely fits my shaving brush ([[ASIN:B001A3HPT0 Van Der Hagen Premium Shave Set (Soap, Bowl, Brush)]]), but it works for what I need.</li>
    <li> It holds my heavy shaving brush without tipping over. It&#x27;s minimalist, but sturdy enough for me. Defnitely worth the purchase, given the other options out there and the cost.</li>
    <li> Holds the things well enough.  The brush rests on the counter a bit though, doesnt hang freely like the stand it came with (which got lost)</li>
    <li> 4.5 inches wide, 3.5 inches tall. Clean, functional and modern. Sometimes it&#x27;s worth a few extra bucks to get a simpler and better product that no one else has the plain sense to make.</li>
    <li> Flimsy construction: tried to gingerly bend the brush side straight and the circular hanger snapped right off. Looks to be held in place with nothing more than JB Weld.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poor design: Too tall to seat a DE razor (unless it&#x27;s a long handle). Too short to hang a brush by the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price isn&#x27;t bad, but it&#x27;s about the same as the other, better-designed, better-constructed offerings. So don&#x27;t make the mistake I did. Buy the other. Or save your money and grab pliers and a coat hanger.</li>
    <li> Love it. My brush and my razor fit great. Keeps my sink area clean and neat. Wish it had a place for my straight razor.</li>
    <li> This stand is nice and small but offers great balance. My razor and brush both stay put fine.  If you are looking car a good value stand with a light appearance, this is a option. I would buy this again.  Thx</li>
    <li> A solid stand. Really contemporary looking. Fits my short DE razor and brush very well and looks great. The best thing is that the wife likes it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great value overall.</li>
    <li> The stand is very sturdy and feels very high quality. I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it!</li>
    <li> Someone told me this would hold a badger hair brush without a problem. They didn&#x27;t say you had to get the hair off the badger first. I don’t understand the complaints about the brush holder being too close to the razor. When there’s an angry badger in your bathroom you want quick access to every weapon available.</li>
    <li> Love the product and design. Looks and feels well made. Razor area seems like it is made for long handle razor in order to sit on bottom area of stand. I have standard razor and it hangs nicely. I like the flexibility in the product. Seems like a lot of money for a simple chrome wire item, but it is a good value compared to others. It is exactly what I was looking for and met expectations. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This stand does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do - allow the razor and brush to air dry without standing in the dripped water.</li>
    <li> Good but not great. I love the idea of this little stand, but it&#x27;s got a couple strikes against it. For starters, the brush opening was too big for my brush, so I had to put it in a vice to narrow it down. Additionally, the flat back makes you assume you could just put it against the wall, but unfortunately my razor is tall enough that just ends up propped against the wall when I use it like that. Lastly, it&#x27;s just too light and gets bumped over when removing the brush. With just a bit of tweaking of the angles and putting a heavy solid base on it would make it much more useful.</li>
    <li> If the brush holder had more distance from the razor stand it would be 5 stars. But the wet brush will touch the razor if put back immediately after use.</li>
    <li> Great stand. Simple and functional.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas so I will try to come back and rate it after using it for a while but for now...the product looks exactly as pictured. Seems to be very sturdy and should last a while with proper care. Arrived quickly and it is a good price for the product.</li>
    <li> Too small for my brush and then it broke when I tried to get it to hold my stuff.</li>
    <li> The item fits in the medicine cabinet, is sleek and yet sturdy. The razor has at least a four inch handle. We have had it for more than a month and I&#x27;ve never heard it fall out of the cabinet  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> If you have a Merkur 180 long-handled razor, don&#x27;t purchase this stand. The razor is too tall to hang from the stand and just leans against it. The brush holder is a little too tight for some brush handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately this doesn&#x27;t really work for my kit, but it&#x27;s a decent quality stand and should be great if you have a short-handled safety razor.</li>
    <li> The stand is exactly what it says it is, but nothing special.  It&#x27;s essentially heavy gauge coat hanger.  The edges of mine are a little rough, one of them is sharp.  I&#x27;m not really a fan of that, but the price reflected the quality of the product.  Don&#x27;t expect Awesome, expect &amp;#34;it gets the job done&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Sharp looking and functional, fits the medicine cabinet and will not tip over. Do note that this is not for shorter handle razors, but is excellent for brushes with larger handles as well.</li>
    <li> I needed something to hold both my husband&#x27;s double-edged razor and his shaving brush, but not take up too much space on our small counter. The brush fits the holder perfectly without any danger of tipping.</li>
    <li> Item came in 3 days before expected arrival date. Really nice chrome plating and very durable. Husband loved the design since the brush and razor are stored on the same side. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I just received this, and it fit by Merkur razor and Art of Shaving brush great - much better than just leaving them on the counter top. I was afraid that the razor might corrode and the brush become misshapen because of the way I was drying them before. Now, they are more organized on the counter top, and the razor and brush should last longer. The stand&#x27;s quality is excellent, and the price is quite reasonable.</li>
    <li> Well, like many I am newly getting into the &amp;#34;old fashioned manly&amp;#34; way of shaving with a safety razor. Still not very far into this ordeal however it became very evident that in order to keep my badger brush in good shape and keep counter space uncluttered I would need a good shaving handle stand of some sort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s plenty of cheapo plastic, or very expensive luxury stands if you look for them. While both of these might be good for most (for those not wanting to spend $$, or those that just really enjoy their shaving for the more expensive items) I fell into the middle of these categories and wanted something durable (metal) and not completely crappy looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where this item came in, and fits the bill very nicely. The price was great, and the shipper sent it very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No regrets here, pick yourself up one!</li>
    <li> Too short and too fat!  My brush is by SheaMoisture and does not appear to be significantly different from my previous brushes.  However, this stand is too wide to actually hang my brush so it serves as a rest with the bristles touching the bottom.  Since I bought it for drying the brush properly, this is a big disappointment.  It appears that the brush would touch even if the holder was a bit tighter.  I think the narrowest part of most brushes is much narrower than this holder presumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a 3-piece DE razor that does rest as the stand is designed.  I do let the blade and parts air dry before reassembling to put it on the stand so, to some extent, this portion of the product is superfluous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What will I do about it.  I will use it.  I am tempted to take pliers to the brush holder but I am afraid the weld would not stand up to that treatment.</li>
    <li> Great little stand, does just what you would expect it to do. Stands there holding a brush and a razor like a little soldier. Great for long handles as the grommet in front hold the base of the handle allowing the head to rest in place without movement.</li>
    <li> At first i did not think the brush would fit on this stand (van der hagen deluxe brush) but if i hang the brush at the base of the bristles and not at the handle then the brush fits well. This is a simple product that does what it&#x27;s supposed to, and that is hold your razor and brush.  i like the minimalist look and the entire thing is much easier to clean than any other stand would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I originally bought this for my Feather Popular De Razor which fit perfectly. The razor side is too high for my Edwin Jagger DE89ibl. I still use the stand for most of my razors and my brush</li>
    <li> Took a long time to find a holder for my new razor and brush because all the ones I could find seemed overpriced. This product does just what it&#x27;s meant to. Sturdy and reasonably priced.</li>
