      <li>My skin looks great</li>
      <li>I love this product!!</li>
      <li>This product is amazing!  </li>
      <li>My skin was burnt, if you have a fair complexion I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Love this masque!</li>
      <li>The price for this is so much better than if you go through a representative also!  </li>
      <li>Most amazing mask ever makes your skin glow like a 19-year-old!</li>
      <li>But the results were just amazing my skin tone went done one tone and the spots in my face are ligther.</li>
      <li>It smells really nice too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Many people tell me how nice my skin is looking.</li>
      <li>I have used many masks, some that burned, this one I experienced quick results</li>
      <li>This product is wonderful, gives your skin a healthy sun kissed glow and makes your skin soft to the touch!</li>
      <li>and I end up with many pimples.</li>
      <li>Sure used to though, hence the anti aging products now.</li>
      <li>I already know that I love the product</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s the best mask for instant rejuvenation and improved skin texture.</li>
      <li>I do have fair, sensitive skin, so this was a plus for me for sure.  </li>
      <li>This is such a great product.  </li>
      <li>If you want to say money at the spa - the professional grade light peel is just as good as any 5 star treatment.  </li>
      <li>Not everyone will have this issue I am sure, but for now I do, and it is nice to know I am getting deep into the pores and getting all the bacteria out.</li>
      <li>However, after a couple of hours, it was much better and had no lasting detrimental effects :).  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, and I am able to use this mask.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a hair over 50, so this is starting to become more important to me.  </li>
      <li>So all in all, this is a nice product and does leave your skin feeling smooth and tight.  </li>
      <li>The shipping was fast and very VERY well packaged!  </li>
      <li>I love the instant results.</li>
      <li>sun-kissed for the first hour after use, which I love because I definitely don&#x27;t purposefully let the sun kiss my face anymore.</li>
      <li>When I first started using it, my skin broke out in blackheads, and a friend told me that I was detoxing and to keep it up</li>
      <li>I have used this product before it is the only mask I love</li>
      <li>So pleased, will definitely be using this seller again!</li>
      <li>I just used this product for the first time.</li>
      <li>Never had a reaction to a mask,  this one left me bright red like a sunburn on my skin.</li>
      <li>Just be careful to not leave it on longer than it recommends...because it is super strong.  </li>
      <li>I discovered this mask at a spa where I enjoyed a nice facial, and the aesthetician gave me a small sample to take home.  </li>
      <li>It was quickly remedied by following the mask with the serum and night moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this masque once a week for a few years, and I love what it does for my skin.</li>
      <li>The delivery date was as promised the packaging was new.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pricey but this seller offers a decent discount.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, my skin was mildy red and tingly during/after use</li>
      <li>While it&#x27;s a little pricey, this is one of the few masks that actually seems to work, especially on fine lines.  </li>
      <li>and it would clear.</li>
      <li>Young &#x3D;</li>
      <li>Once the bacteria is drained, my skin looks freah and young...</li>
      <li>I do not have sensitive skin at all.</li>
      <li>even for a 56 year old</li>
      <li>It tingles after it&#x27;s been on for several minutes and really helps with overall complexion tone and feel.  </li>
      <li>you leave it on real long, your face may appear a little red - a little red is good, since it shows that you&#x27;re alive!!!</li>
      <li>My pores are visibily smaller and my skin feels so soft and smoothe!  </li>
      <li>but I can tell I am possibly building a tolerance to the product as my skin isn&#x27;t as sensitive when I use it now.  </li>
      <li>My skin was soft, although very dry but that an age issue.  </li>

    <li> I discovered this mask at a spa where I enjoyed a nice facial, and the aesthetician gave me a small sample to take home.  It tingles after it&#x27;s been on for several minutes and really helps with overall complexion tone and feel.  While it&#x27;s a little pricey, this is one of the few masks that actually seems to work, especially on fine lines.  I&#x27;m a hair over 50, so this is starting to become more important to me.  I&#x27;d recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Most amazing mask ever makes your skin glow like a 19-year-old! Loooove it!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  I can visibly see the difference in my skin after 5-6 minutes (I am slightly paranoid of having it on too long since I read a couple reviews of people who did).  The first time I used it, my skin was mildy red and tingly during/after use but I can tell I am possibly building a tolerance to the product as my skin isn&#x27;t as sensitive when I use it now.  My pores are visibily smaller and my skin feels so soft and smoothe!  I use this product at least once a week.  The price for this is so much better than if you go through a representative also!  The shipping was fast and very VERY well packaged!  So pleased, will definitely be using this seller again!</li>
    <li> I use this product on the weekends because it brings all the grime from deep in my skin to the surface and I end up with many pimples. I use an exfolating cleanser when the breakouts come and it opens up and drains the bacteria. Once the bacteria is drained, my skin looks freah and young... even for a 56 year old woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t use it before a big event, unless it is like a week in advance. Not everyone will have this issue I am sure, but for now I do, and it is nice to know I am getting deep into the pores and getting all the bacteria out. Many people tell me how nice my skin is looking.</li>
    <li> Never had a reaction to a mask,  this one left me bright red like a sunburn on my skin. As a previous reviewer said , harsh!  I never had that happened to me and I used peels etc...</li>
    <li> The delivery error I mentioned in a prior review was an internal error. The item was misplaced by another member of the household and I thought it has not arrived. The delivery date was as promised the packaging was new. I already know that I love the product, it&#x27;s the best mask for instant rejuvenation and improved skin texture. It&#x27;s pricey but this seller offers a decent discount.</li>
    <li> will buy this again. product does what is says. I love the instant results. makes my skin look younger instantly.</li>
    <li> Love this masque! I have sensitive skin, and I am able to use this mask. I usually leave this on for about 5 minutes sometimes longer.&lt;br /&gt;If you leave it on real long, your face may appear a little red - a little red is good, since it shows that you&#x27;re alive!!! Young &#x3D; Alive!&lt;br /&gt;I do like this, and have bought this a second time - It gives your skin a youthful appearance.</li>
    <li> Please understand that I would have to see a DRAMATIC difference in my skin to rate a product 4 or 5 stars... as in people noticing and commenting on my skin.  So all in all, this is a nice product and does leave your skin feeling smooth and tight.  It smells really nice too.&lt;br /&gt;I accidentally left the product on for 12 minutes, not watching the clock and when I rinsed it off, my face was RED and felt sunburnt.. I was actually afraid I had caused some damage.  However, after a couple of hours, it was much better and had no lasting detrimental effects :).  I do have fair, sensitive skin, so this was a plus for me for sure.  I will use it again, and leave it on for the 5-7 minutes it recommends.</li>
    <li> I just used this product for the first time. I have never reacted poorly to a mask, but I did to this one!! My face is on fire :( this is a terrible product. I do not have sensitive skin at all. This product left me burnt, red and tight/painful.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful, gives your skin a healthy sun kissed glow and makes your skin soft to the touch!</li>
    <li> this porduct its perfect for sentive skin! my skin is like crazy sensitive and all I got was a little redness and some tingling. But the results were just amazing my skin tone went done one tone and the spots in my face are ligther. Im going to keep using it and see if it removes all the marks in my face.</li>
    <li> Arrived well protected</li>
    <li> This is such a great product.  If you want to say money at the spa - the professional grade light peel is just as good as any 5 star treatment.  Just be careful to not leave it on longer than it recommends...because it is super strong.  Leaves your skin glowing.....</li>
    <li> I love this product!!</li>
    <li> great product and will buy it again!</li>
    <li> This cellular masque tightens your skin and reduces your pores so beautifully.  Though it says to use it twice a week, I only use it once a week and exfoliate the other days in between.  My skin looks great and I do attribute to all of the Arbonne products.</li>
    <li> I have used many masks, some that burned, this one I experienced quick results and it didn&#x27;t burn.  My skin was soft, although very dry but that an age issue.  It was quickly remedied by following the mask with the serum and night moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before it is the only mask I love</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this masque once a week for a few years, and I love what it does for my skin. When I first started using it, my skin broke out in blackheads, and a friend told me that I was detoxing and to keep it up and it would clear. It did after a few uses, and now when I use it it simply makes my skin glow. It almost makes my face look sun-kissed for the first hour after use, which I love because I definitely don&#x27;t purposefully let the sun kiss my face anymore. Sure used to though, hence the anti aging products now.</li>
    <li> Read lots of reviews praising product, used twice as instructed by directions on jar. My skin was burnt, if you have a fair complexion I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
