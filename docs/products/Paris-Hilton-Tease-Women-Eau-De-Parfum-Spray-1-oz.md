      <li>Light flower smell, sexy but yet not overbearing.</li>
      <li>I loved it so much that I went christmas shopping, saw it in the store and purchased another one.</li>
      <li>Not only is miss Paris pretty but her perfume smell pretty good 😊 very happy with this buy</li>
      <li>Nyc bottle &amp; the scent is sophisticated in a mild way.</li>
      <li>enjoy wearing Tease.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
      <li>I bought it because it was on sale and then got free shipping</li>
      <li>Love this...can&#x27;t bet price and fast shipping :)</li>
      <li>But on the plus side, the perfume smell does last  exceptionally longer than most.</li>
      <li>It is a unique scent.  </li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t anything special.  </li>
      <li>My husband just loves the sweet fragrance ...</li>
      <li>This is a very lite and sophisticated floral.</li>
      <li>At first I thought this was going to be strong</li>
      <li>I GOT LUCKY WITH THIS SCENT AS</li>
      <li>Way too strong and not appealing or sexy!!</li>
      <li>It smells very chemical-y, and it&#x27;s way too strong.</li>
      <li>TRIED ONE BOTTLE OF THIS AND CAME BACK AND ORDERED LIKE 6 OR 8 MORE!</li>
      <li>that I didn&#x27;t smell the apples or peaches but this really smells good and smells better once it dies down.</li>
      <li>Overall though,good value and does smell nice.</li>
      <li>AND WE LAUGH WHEN PEOPLE ASK US WHAT</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m not crazy about it, something in the scent is a bit off to me.</li>
      <li>but I feel it is for someone a bit more (mature).</li>
      <li>I went ahead and spritzed some more on when I got back from my appointment before going back out again (because smelling like an old lady is still better than smelling like cheap, musty crafts) and this time, it smelled a bit better...</li>
      <li>I can honestly say this is about the second perfume I have bought from amazon that I am in love with, Its a soft gentle smell</li>
      <li>the smell is ok and stay longer enough</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s just to over powering when you first spray it.</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments at work,  am constantly stopped and asked &amp;</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like this at first</li>
      <li>This bottle is pretty..</li>
      <li>Came back to get some more, after I tried it, and the price had went up.  </li>
      <li>I got it really fast in the mail!  </li>
      <li>a long time, I like it for my afternoon wear :)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Amazing price! Great Christmas gifts</li>
    <li> Was a little smaller than I thought but smells really good and last at least 8 hours which is gr8 for the price!</li>
    <li> Not only is miss Paris pretty but her perfume smell pretty good 😊 very happy with this buy</li>
    <li> I bought all of this small perfumes to take them for a gift for my friend to Mexico and they really really love them they&#x27;re very good and they&#x27;re very good prices too</li>
    <li> Beautiful bottle, but scent just isn&#x27;t me.</li>
    <li> This perfume is awful! It goes on smelling like an old lady perfume and has no staying power. The dry down smells like construction paper. I went ahead and spritzed some more on when I got back from my appointment before going back out again (because smelling like an old lady is still better than smelling like cheap, musty crafts) and this time, it smelled a bit better... BUT, it gave me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This came with a set &amp;#34;Paris Hilton Variety 5 Piece Mini Gift Set for Women&amp;#34; http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00N8I10YG/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2 and I plan on reviewing each scent individually as I try them out.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and good seller</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many ppl coming to me telling me how wonderful I smell!! Love this...can&#x27;t bet price and fast shipping :)</li>
    <li> I like this perfume, it&#x27;s very different. But a little too fruity for me. Something about the smell, was always a little off for me. But on the plus side, the perfume smell does last  exceptionally longer than most.</li>
    <li> This fragrance lasts throughout the day. I get so many compliments at work,  am constantly stopped and asked &amp;#34;what are you wearing?&amp;#34; I use very little, but it goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I like the bottle design.  It is a unique scent.  It wasn&#x27;t anything special.  I didn&#x27;t get any feedback whatsoever.  I will say this sample size lasted me almost 2 months.  So it may be best suited for others, I just wasn&#x27;t terribly impressed.</li>
    <li> Honestly I love the smell but I feel like it doesn&#x27;t last that long</li>
    <li> It mells good and it was shipped on time!</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent great gift for a grandma</li>
    <li> At first I thought this was going to be strong and I hate strong perfume and mad that I didn&#x27;t smell the apples or peaches but this really smells good and smells better once it dies down. I wish I had got the larger bottle.</li>
    <li> This perfume isn&#x27;t bad. It&#x27;s very floral but in a soft, wearable way. This perfume isn&#x27;t offensive but also definitely isn&#x27;t what I would consider a sweet scent. It smells exactly like gardenia and sometimes lilies, but there is also a slight warmth that keeps it modest. It&#x27;s a very good price and would make an awesome gift to any perfume collector.</li>
    <li> I like it, it&#x27;s amazing. I received this product fast. Thanks a lot for this beautiful and amazing prroduct. Regards</li>
    <li> I like Paris Hilton&#x27;s perfumes, but I think whoever came up with this one wasn&#x27;t in a very good mood at the time. It smells very chemical-y, and it&#x27;s way too strong. It sort of smells like the gas you get after eating Indian food. I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> TRIED ONE BOTTLE OF THIS AND CAME BACK AND ORDERED LIKE 6 OR 8 MORE! AGAIN I USED SOME FOR GIFTS FOR MY GIRLFRIENDS AND WE LAUGH WHEN PEOPLE ASK US WHAT WE ARE WEARING.......TEASE!  ANYWAY, ANOTHER CHEAPER SCENT BUT THE BOTTLE IS GREAT LOOKING AND AGAIN, I THINK IT&#x27;S LIKE $4.95 FOR THIS SMALLER VERSION BUT A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY. I GET COMPLIMENTS EVERY TIME I WEAR IT. I GOT LUCKY WITH THIS SCENT AS WELL. DEFINITLEY BUY IT!</li>
    <li> It is strong and smells good but I feel it is for someone a bit more (mature). I am 30 and feel this would smell better on my Mom. Overall though,good value and does smell nice.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t for me.. Way too strong and not appealing or sexy!! It may be for you tho.. That&#x27;s why I always try small bottles! I do love paris hilton just me tho!! This bottle is pretty.. But a no!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good perfume for the price it&#x27;s worthed the smell is ok and stay longer enough try this product see if you like it.</li>
    <li> very strong... not at pleasant as her others.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. It smells wonderful and the scent stays on your skin for a long time.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this perfume. It smells great. This is my favorite one. The size of the bottle is perfect. I will buy.again &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This is a very lite and sophisticated floral. TRULY surprised. My question always is: Would I like to have someone step into an elevator with this fragrance? Yes AND stand next to me pls! I&#x27;d ask what it was. Perfect for an outdoor summer afternoon pool/beach/patio party.</li>
    <li> Much to my surprise, I really like this Eau De Parfum.  I thought it was going to be little girl or young girly scent.  But it&#x27;s not.  It&#x27;s a lovely spring and summer scent and it lasts hours on me.  Lovely lovely floral scent in the beginning, like hyacinth or lilac mixed with other light florals, and slight spice in the dry down.&lt;br /&gt; I got the one ounce for $6 and change.  Came back to get some more, after I tried it, and the price had went up.  It came boxed, cellophane wrapped inside another box.  Wish I had purchased more bottles of it now.&lt;br /&gt; I do not note synthetic scents in this parfum.  Some are made from synthetics so bad they smell like soap.  This one isn&#x27;t like that.&lt;br /&gt;Really enjoy wearing Tease.&lt;br /&gt; I am near 60 years old...</li>
    <li> This is a great Parfum!!!!</li>
    <li> SCENT DOESNT LAST LONG...BUT SMELLS NICE FOR ABOUT AN HOUR...ITS A HEAVY MUSKY SCENT...WOULD GIVE MORE STARS IF IT LASTED LONGER..</li>
    <li> Reminds me of an old lady that showers in her perfume. I didn&#x27;t like this at first but it grew on me. Once it drys down it smells better. I sprayed the air to have my boyfriend smell &amp; he didn&#x27;t like it, but another day I was wearing it he said I smell nice. I think it&#x27;s just to over powering when you first spray it.</li>
    <li> my husband loves when i wear Tease..nuf said</li>
    <li> Wow! I smell like heaven. Thank youuuuuuuu.😍</li>
    <li> I really love this scent and the price was good and the packaging was excellent. with additional token.</li>
    <li> Excelente producto recomendado para todos, muy buen vendedor</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance! Smells sensual.</li>
