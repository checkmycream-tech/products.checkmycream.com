      <li>A dermalogist said it was the best product you can use for actually firming the skin.  </li>
      <li>but I sure would not sleep in it.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>Its just OK.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Did not see any significant change with it but it did make my skin feel smoother.</li>
    <li> It does what says ..it&#x27;s not heavy on your face and your skin keeps improving the more you use it...I will be using it for a long time..</li>
    <li> feels good on skin.  have only started using it so too early to tell if it is firming.  I really like most all Reviva products!</li>
    <li> I love this product! in fact I am about to place an order for my second bottle. Although I am 60 years young I am very fortunate to have very few wrinkles. I have some fine lines close to my jowls and smokers lines above my upper lip. This product has smoothed out all of my problems. I use it in the AM and in the PM as a component of my daily skin care routine. I read several of the reviews prior to my first purchase and followed the advice that the product be \\&quot;patted\\&quot; on the skin rather that massaged into the skin. I have extremely sensitive skin that is prone to react to almost anything I put on it. I have not had any negative reactions with this product. Needless to say, I am hooked!</li>
    <li> So far.so good.  Like the Reviva Labs Products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 months. I don&#x27;t notice much when I use this product.  It accentuates the darkness under my eyes, so I stopped using it there.  I also believe it was making me break out on my cheeks, so I stopped using it there too. It&#x27;s moisturizing, so it&#x27;s good for dry patches. I am in my early 30&#x27;s and don&#x27;t have wrinkles, so maybe it would work better for someone with different skin texture? I think the only benefit is the moisturizing properties, which I don&#x27;t really need.</li>
    <li> I saw very little improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because of Dr Phil&#x27;s presentation about how DMAE helps with wrinkles etc. I used it for about a week and a half and found that it made my face brake-out! I do need to add that I have occasional brake-outs and have used benzyl peroxide products. So maybe this is something that does not mix with what I am using.    It just didn&#x27;t do that much for me. I have purchased the firming eye serum as well and I do like it better.  I think the addition of the lipoic acid and vitamin c ester helps the product.</li>
    <li> This does not do what it promises to do.  I did not notice anything when I applied the serum.  I am still on the search for a true firming and lifting cream or serum.</li>
    <li> I love this serum, it absorbs well and defiantly helps with the appearance of ones skin. This can easily be worn under you day or night cream, it is not greasy. Reviva makes really great skin care products that are not tested on animals and don&#x27;t contain animal ingredients.</li>
    <li> Not youth in a bottle, but is minimally effective.  Better than their eye firming liquid.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. I use it everyday after I wash my face. Then I put on my moisturizer. It does keep me looking younger. I&#x27;m 57 years old and I have already recommend it to several of my friends, and they are using it too.  Don&#x27;t buy it at Whole Foods like I did the first bottle....it cost much more.  Just a drop on your finger is all you need, a little goes a long ways.  This small bottle will last about two months.</li>
    <li> I bought my first bottle of this serum, and ordered the second bottle after about three weeks because I didn&#x27;t want to run out! I&#x27;m 41, my skin is oily and breakout prone, with dark spots from old acne scars and sun damage. I wanted a product with DMAE that didn&#x27;t have a bunch of other stuff in it that would make my face break out. This is it! No breakouts, and my skin just looks brighter, refreshed. The dark spots are fading with this more than with anything else I&#x27;ve ever used; it seems to be increasing exfoliation so that some spots are disappearing and others are revealed - like we&#x27;re going through layers of skin. I hope that means we&#x27;ll eventually get to a point where I&#x27;m mostly free of spots. :) Makes my skin beautifully smooth; I&#x27;m proactively using it on my neck and decollette as well.</li>
    <li> This fluid appears to have really been helpful in reducing the wrinkles in my skin.  I&#x27;m 55 years old, and have a pretty good complexion to begin with, but this has made a noticeable difference.  I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks.  I love it.  I have noticed my jawline area has definitely firmed up.  I will definitely order again.  If you having issues with sagging skin, this product is for you.  I woke up one morning and noticed my skin around my jaw line was droopy.  I panic, because I have never ever had problems with wrinkles or crows feet.  Saggy skin is much worst than any wrinkles.  I had order everything off the market and nothing would work.  I decided to try this product and wow...a dramatic differnce.  Combined with my homemade vitamin c serum, I look normal again.  This product is now my life long product for sure.  A great addition to any skin care regimine.  It shipped very fast and for that I would order anything from this seller.  One of my greatest purchases on Amazon thus far</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now, and am getting compliments and being asked \\&quot;what have you done, you look wonderful\\&quot;.  It just gives your face a little lift.  I use a moisturizer over it or it would be much too dry on my skin.</li>
    <li> I used this with Reviva Labs TGF Beta-1 Cream, used them twice daily. They made my skin very itchy so I needed to stop using them both. I thought overall it was a huge waste of money. I do not recommend Reviva Labs to anyone.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t notice any difference</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle.  I could tell the the wrinkles around my mouth were not as obvious and my skin looked better.</li>
    <li> Reviva _ Dmae Firming Fluid goes on smoothly and is aborbed quickly into your skin. This product is light enough so you can add an additional SPF for added protection.  Dmae Firming Fluid leaves your face smooth and soft.  I like this product and will order it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I saw it on Dr. Oz. A dermalogist said it was the best product you can use for actually firming the skin.  I really like it and I think I see a difference. If it keeps my face and neck just the way they are now, I&#x27;ll be happy. I intend to purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I decided to try the Reviva firming fluid based on the reviews that I read. Well, I am happy, it really made my skin firmer and the plus about it is there are not too many chemicals. I will recommend it to anyone and I will buy it again. The seller is also good because the package arrived right on time.</li>
    <li> Targets nasty situations. It is economical too and goes a long way. Disappears with no residue. A little drop will do ya!</li>
    <li> This product is the Holy Grail of beauty products! No joke! My husband&#x27;s cousin came by last night (I have not seen him in months) and as we were talking he kept staring at me when I asked why he was staring at me he actually asked me if I had a face lift! Lol I am 43 years old! A little young for that don&#x27;t you think! The only thing I have been using for months is this serum. It is amazing, it leaves your face fresh and tight looking. The bottle is small and you only need a few drops, I put that on my face after I have washed it and then put a moisturizer on top (I use any moisturizer handy). Ladies it works - try it. I am going to order five bottles after I write this review in case you all order a bottle and there is none left for me lol. I wonder why none of my dermatologists have ever recommended this........good luck :)</li>
    <li> This fluid has all the right ingredients in it to work better than anything else on the market, I did the research. Of course it isn&#x27;t magic or a face lift but it does help. I recommend getting the cream and eye firming fluid to go with it. They can&#x27;t all be purchased from the same company but that didn&#x27;t cause any problems for me. Price is great to say the least, especially when compared to the department stores and high end brands, which, if they don;t include these ingredients, won&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I heard all the praise about DMAE.  I thought a lightweight serum would be a smart choice for me because I tend to break out, even at 40 years old.  I thought this product would help firm my skin, and it did - and then some!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now, and every time I look in the mirror, I&#x27;m startled by the transformation in my skin; not only is it softer and firmer, but it&#x27;s also brighter!  Since I&#x27;ve been applying it to my neck also, I&#x27;ve noticed that my thyroid surgery scar has lightened dramatically.  I was amazed by this, as I had previously spent a few months religiously applying Bio Oil to that scar, which only irritated it and made it bright red.  So, I gave up trying to treat my scar purposely, and was pleasantly surprised that this DMAE product did the job without me trying.  I bought my second bottle today because I never want to run out of this \\&quot;miracle in a bottle!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I personally did not notice any change from using this product except for it beading up and flaking off my skin.</li>
    <li> have seen some improvement</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for a few years and this is the best price I&#x27;ve seen it.  Really helps save on your moisturizer, as it helps it to \\&quot;glide\\&quot; on.</li>
    <li> I originally discovered this product at a GNC store.  After using it about 3 weeks, I eagerly went in search of more........no luck!  GNC has decided not to carry this particular DMAE product.  Thanks Amazon for coming to the rescue again.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a boost to their appearace and complexion.  My sensitive skin loves this product and it does smooth out fine lines over time with no harsh peeling!  This is a \\&quot;keeper\\&quot; in my house!</li>
    <li> I researched DMAE for skin care, and then I read about this product and I love it.  I&#x27;m 60 but I look like 14 !  Well, that&#x27;s not true, but it does help firm up your skin tone -- on your face and neck and I like it.  I do apply a moisturizer with Resevratol over the DMAE fluid, and then sunscreen like a good girl.  It&#x27;s been about 2 weeks and I like the results.  Tighter firmer skin, fewer wrinkles.  You really need to take a before and after picture, giving it a few weeks.  I will buy more.</li>
    <li> I love your product, use at bedtime, and daytime as we&#x27;ll under makeup! Love this product I&#x27;ll use again. Awesome!</li>
    <li> This firming fluid is absolutely AWESOME!  Started using after seeing DMAE on Dr. Oz.  I cannot count how many compliments I get for my skin.  The fluid spreads well so only one dot is needed.  I use another dot for my neck and chest.  I also put Argon Oil as a moisturizer after the fluid dries.  Definitely a staple for the rest of my life.  This is definitely the fountain of youth.</li>
    <li> I could see no visible changes in my skin, even after weeks of use. Save your money.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have much hope for this product as I have tried many firming products, but this did seem to help.  When I stopped using it, i noticed more sagging.  I use it at night only as it seems to flake when I put make up over it.  I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Great if you&#x27;re a woman who wants to grow facial hair.</li>
    <li> I could be fooling myself, but I think this really does reduce the appearance of lines and wrinkles.  Notice I said the APPEARANCE,  the only sure fire way to actually get rid of mine is to either sandblast my face or spend thousands on a plastic surgeon.  I&#x27;m not vain enough to care that much. ☺️</li>
    <li> It firmed up the skin and even the underlying saggy areas under my chin.  It may have helped my face, I couldn&#x27;t tell for sure.  I have some denial about the wrinkles.  I lost no weight.  The only other factor was riding a bike around the block a little every week.  But the fluid definitely helped.  The spring devices under the chin I also bought on Amazon did not work but improved my posture while using them.  Hope to go back to that and the bike.  Also purchased the DMAE pills which I still take.  They must do some good, but I can&#x27;t tell.  They are easy to take.  May need a higher dosage,  but have no idea if they have side effects at higher doses.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product very long, but I can already see a positive change in my skin. I will continue to use it, and plan on reordering when I am getting close to an empty bottle.  Thank you for a great product.  :)</li>
    <li> I am SO happy with this product! I have seen such a dramatic improvement after years of using similar products by luxury and elite drugstore brands which work good but were not this strong. My skin is oily/combo and this has a fantastic matte NON drying effect. Via the Perricone skincare method goes great with his nutrition and supplement advice.</li>
    <li> I use this every day. I put this on the creases on my face. I let it dry and then apply my make up. Use it sparingly.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way with this product.  I put it on directly after cleansing morning &amp; night.  It goes on smoothly without aggravating my skin.  Make or moisturizer up goes on easily after it has been absorbed.  So far I am pleased with the results:  fewer crows feet &amp; smoother neck.  Having hit 60, it gives me a reasonably priced option for the neck &amp; d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; area with out a lot of fuss.</li>
    <li> I usually prefer to give positive reviews on things I like and save the negativity, but in this case I have to say something before anyone else makes this mistake.  I  can&#x27;t understand all the 5-star reviews...this stuff was terrible.  Is it just me?  Goes on like water, then balls up on your face and sloughs off.  No moisture and didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34; anything.  When I get skincare products I don&#x27;t really &amp;#34;love&amp;#34;, at least I&#x27;ll use them on my neck or chest just to use them up...not this stuff.  Total waste of money.  (As an FYI I am 48, with generally good skin for my age, just trying to keep it that way!)  Going back to my FAVORITE skincare product (Olay Regenerist Serum fragrance-free) for good this time!</li>
    <li> Not sure if its just me, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the results.  I also had minor breakouts maybe due to this product.  I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using the fluid for a while but have been buying at Sprouts. This is a much better price!</li>
    <li> Great product for a good price.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well so far. Skin seems a little firmer and smoother as well. May reorder in the future</li>
    <li> This lasts for a while (I use it liberally - a full pump 2x per day and it lasted a little over 3 mos.) - you only need a little, and the results are visible within 3 weeks or so. I use this in conjunction with oral DMAE supplements and Collagen and Vit C supplements.</li>
    <li> I have been using DMAE cream and wanted to add a serum to my daily regemine. This is not it. It is very sticky and pills up on the skin. It is very drying. Be forewarned, this is one of those products that cannot be returned.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this product. Get compliments on how resilient &amp;  nice my skin looks from Estetitians. Packed very well no chance of breakage</li>
    <li> It is a fine product and smooths on easily... I just need a little bit more firming.&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints about this product ... it really does so what it says and no irritation</li>
    <li> This use to be a really good product; however the &amp;#34;Stronger Firming Action&amp;#34; appears to be &amp;#34;MORE&amp;#34; alcohol or something in the product that smells like ,alcohol.  This product drys out my skin and there is no firming...maybe less...I am disappointed...will not order again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So  disappointing...:(</li>
    <li> DMAE works good. I read that it will help tone your skin using it daily. Would recommend if your looking for DMAE.</li>
    <li> This item works better than many of the more expensive products that I have tried for wrinkles.  Been using it for about a month and like it.  Goes on and dries quickly. You can add a moisturize before putting on makeup and your face looks great.  For the money a very good product.</li>
    <li> I used this product a last year and noticed definite results to literally in my case remove the lines you have on your chest/ wrinkles from sleeping at night.&lt;br /&gt;I did discontinue the product and applied different retinol products for several month to see if they would make a differed a lce. Nothing.&lt;br /&gt;As Retinol is so highly claimed to be a huge help in diminishing wrinkles I felt like I should give it a try, one good product I can recommend is the Neutrogena Retinol Crème, comes in a tube, it helped a lot on the laugh lines and lines between my eyebrows. I even applied it under my make up , which works really good.&lt;br /&gt;But it did not help so smoothen out the wrinkles on my chest?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I am back to Reviva Firming Serum and can only highly recommend it&lt;br /&gt;For me it did not work under my make up , as after a while when it dried it came off?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this will help someone</li>
    <li> I bought this based on Truth in Aging  reviews for Reviva Labs products. While I am not displeased, I am not overly impressed.  It goes on smoothly and absorbs well, but slowly.  I do think that my dark circles improved  and it feels good and cooling on my eyes. So far, this is the only brand I have used so I can&#x27;t say how it compares other brands.</li>
    <li> does not work as advertised, don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> I believe this is a very high quality product! I normally buy very high grade skin care products from BellaHut.com. A lot of her products incorporate DMAE, but I&#x27;ve never come across just the DMAE. I love the fact that you only need 2 pumps to do the whole face and the entire neck area!&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs well and I love the way my skin feels when I use it......which is daily!&lt;br /&gt;Great product, great price! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> A good product for the money.  There is so many facial firming products out there, but I have been using this one regularly for a couple of years.</li>
    <li> I used for 2 months and saw no results or change in skin firmness</li>
    <li> Great product, great price.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product in years past but forgot how effective it was. I have pretty decent skin based on genetics (grandfather lived to be 103 this year but passed in July). I use as a skin boost. I have extremely sensitive skin but serum is mild and does not irritate. I will recommend and definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I think I can see a difference in my neck.</li>
    <li> Worked wonders for me! Since recently having a baby I&#x27;ve had small, puffy bags under my eyes and I just look tired all the time even when I&#x27;m well rested. I got this in the mail the other day and tried it...woke up this morning and I&#x27;m very impressed with the results! Just one use and I look well rested, refreshed and my skin looked visibly brighter! The bags are gone and my eyes look amazing! I&#x27;m so happy with this product that I ended up buying one for my mom as a gift! FYI...the reason I bought this is I saw a segment on the Dr. OZ show and he featured anti-aging products with DMEA in them spoke very highly of them. Hence this amazon purchase! Way to go Dr. OZ!</li>
    <li> DMAE is a must have to keep your skin young looking. DMAE goes on your skin like silk which makes it easy to layer your creams for ultimate protection.</li>
    <li> should have been stronger but you can feel skin tighten when you put it on---but in consistent with bottles bought two -- felt one -the other bottle felt less strength</li>
    <li> Just another &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; elixir...nothing amazing.  It is pleasant, unscented,  goes on quickly and is also clear and not flaky.  You can apply make-up over it. Some of the rave reviews I read here seem to be &amp;#34;shills,&amp;#34; carrying on about immediate effects.  I don&#x27;t see it.  I am not a youngster, so I do not expect a miracle.</li>
    <li> I am not sure what the secret is but I have seen results. I take very good care of my skin but I live in Colorado and  the weather is dry and toll taking. I did see more resilience after just a few applications. It works best for me on clean toned skin. Skin looks tighter and no makeup (foundation) is needed (most days).  i do apply an appropriate layer of  sunscreen over it. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This product does seem to firm up lines in the face.</li>
    <li> I used this for several weeks with the Reviva Alpha Lipoic, Vit. C, DMAE Cream.  At first I didn&#x27;t notice any changes but as time went on, my neck developed a horrible red rash that then started to appear on my face as extreme dry patches.  That&#x27;s when I stopped using these products and my skin immediately cleared up.  Horrible and costly experience.</li>
    <li> Junk! Big waste of money!  Grow old gracefully or get get plastic surgery</li>
    <li> I am quite satisfied.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Firms skin immediately &amp; works better with continued use. The line between my eyebrows is nearly gone &amp; my forehead line is disappearing too. Marvelous product &amp; a great value!</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for 4 days and I already have seen good results.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is visibly tithe and looks much better and younger.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend, it works much better than the most expensive lifting seruns out there on the marketing.</li>
    <li> I did not see any changes in my skin while using this product.   I used it for 3 months. I was not expecting miracles. I&#x27;m 30 year old so I really do not have any wrinkles or sagging yet.  I was expecting this product to at least make me look refreshed but it did nothing.  I&#x27;ll continue to use my Olay Regenerist products they are way better than this.  I really wanted to find a more natural facial product but this is not it. I would not buy this product again</li>
    <li> Amazing product!!!  It helps make the skin tighter within a couple of days.  I will continue to buy this product and recommend it to my friends and family. Thank you Revival Labs!</li>
    <li> Have actually seen a difference.</li>
    <li> For the first week or so I could feel the tightening, but after that, I didn&#x27;t see or feel a difference.  Get what you pay for, I guess.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this product.</li>
    <li> Good product! I love this one and order it often</li>
    <li> I do not think this product can firm the skin. I have tried for more than 5 weeks now and have not seen any effect yet,</li>
    <li> Its just OK. I wasn&#x27;t expecting mountains to move, but hoped to see something. You can actually buy this product at Ulta. It&#x27;s true what they say, you get what you pay for when it comes to most cosmetics and skincare.</li>
    <li> Been using this for less than a full week and I honestly really DO see a difference already!! My crinkly looking neck and under chin, greatly improved!!!</li>
    <li> I live in a humid climat,am mid 40 and have very dry skin, except on my forehead at times??&lt;br /&gt;About 2 years ago I started getting adult acne, and it would not clear up no matter what I used.&lt;br /&gt;This is now my routine&lt;br /&gt;Evening: i wash my face with Aqua Glycolic Facial Cleanser. The description says put the cleanser on your dry face, I noticed that I use much less of it when my face is slightly damp. Make sure to wash your hand really good, any soap will do before applying. Massage on face, i am very sensitive to smells and this product even removes all my eye make up !&lt;br /&gt;I love to use Rosewater or any of the toners from lush (you can also find them on amazon) Tea Water etc.&lt;br /&gt;does not have to be the expsensive $ 28 sephora rosewater, which smells heavenly but wow the price!&lt;br /&gt;After the rosewater or any other toner spritz a bit over your face, neck, chest and with about 3 drops (I put them in my hands) rub all over . It is also safe to use around the lip area.&lt;br /&gt;I immediatly follow with a) either eqyptian healing creme, use only a very very small amount, I like to put this especially on areas that did still have some remaining acne healing going on. b) my preferred 98%of the time item i use after the hyaluronic acid is the reviva dmae Firming serum (all over the areas)&lt;br /&gt;My daughter also tried out the dark spot remover from reviva and their products are excellent ! will definitely try their hyaluronic acid as well in the future.&lt;br /&gt;I then use either any kind of moisturizer from the dead sea products(cheap ones) or any l&#x27;oreal creme, you will only need a very small amount since you are kind of layering all the products.&lt;br /&gt;But no worries, at least for me it did not clog pores and it indeed did clear up all breakouts !!! for the first time ever.&lt;br /&gt;I also like to use argan oil or maracuja oil, no big difference except the price (argan is cheaper)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lip lines, fine laugh lines, lines on my forehead are clearly deminished (no they will not disappear !!!!let&#x27;s be realistic) My skin looks as good and fresh as it did in my early 30th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morning routine, I only wash up with water, add the spritzes of toner, then the acid serum, the reviva firm serum BUT only over the lip ,laugh and forehead lines ! I do NOT finish with a moisturizer as i found it slightly makes my make up slide off. (you must put something on top of the serums otherwise your skin might dry out and flake) I found Mally Face Primer does work really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I currently use MAC foundation, that I slightly buff in with a brush and my skin once again finally looks flawless, I still wish it would be a bit more dewey, but found when applying luminators, some take your make up off even if you use only a small amount. Bobbie Brown has a foundation with dewyness, but I did not find a good color match. I am a NC 40 in MAC. Try several samples between the NC 35 and NC 40 range if you have the average skin color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think overall I finally found my perfect cleansing routine, never thought i would be to 99.9 % acne free !&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid definitely gave my complexion an overall evenness, restored some moisture and definitely deminished the lines , especially also on my chest and neck, which really can make you look so much older&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this product works for you , yes it seems like runny water as some negative reviewers commented. But give it a shot , try it for at least a month . Good luck !</li>
    <li> Seems to be a bit drying but smooths on nicely and I am noticing a difference in my skin</li>
    <li> love how it makes my skin feel.&lt;br /&gt;will come back again when i get low.</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> I used two bottles of this product, no improvement on my skin, will not be buying it again.</li>
    <li> This is an incredible serum which not only assists in firming the skin, it also attracts moisture into your skin keeping it plumped, hydrated, and radiant looking.  A few drops (2-4) is all you need at a time.  Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the way this product ubsorbs.  I could notice a difference in my skin tone within days.  My skin feels soft.</li>
    <li> The Reviva DMAE firming fluid really helps to firm facial skin. The texture is non greasy and perfect for all skin types. I really like this product. I would recommend this product to Amazon&#x27;s customers. Great price and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Used only short time but does seem to firm skin</li>
    <li> Works great.  Everyone tells me that I look better and younger than my true age!! Plus it minimizes my pore size which I like.</li>
    <li> Fits my sensitive skin better than more expensive french product I tried before and makes immediate effect that sadly doesn&#x27;t stay long.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this product- I really did- because I love this company- and it got such great reviews- but DMAE is just not for me I guess. I did not see the instant firming some people speak of, and it caused a slight breakout. I&#x27;ll stick to my glycolic acid regime.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY serum I&#x27;ve found that does not clog my pores and cause acne. I use it morning and night. My skin soaks it up. I highly recommend it to tighten skin. My skin is soft and supple. It took about 3 months to see results and I&#x27;ve been using it for 10 months now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a couple of years. It works just as well or better than the expensive ones.</li>
    <li> Definitely works for firming.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product twice.  It firms without flaking or getting scaly and works smoothly under makeup or foundation.  Not a waste of money like so many even more expensive products, unscented, and hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts or irritation of my skin as many other products do.  5 vehement stars.  Woman / Vain / 30s barely.</li>
    <li> I started using DMAE serums and taking DMAE internally years ago after learning how to use it following micro-dermal rolling (micro-needling) procedures. Reviva&#x27;s product goes on very smoothly and gives great results..also very well priced.</li>
    <li> does what it advertises !!!</li>
    <li> Product does tighten skin when you apply it; however, when moisturizer applied over it I am not sure how effective it is. I have been using product for several weeks with no noticeable results.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  I love it.  DMAE is a firming product and the price is right.</li>
    <li> I love this dmae serum. It is very light and smooth. You can feel the firmness in your skin after the first application. I have been using this product for months now and I have sensitive skin. This dmae serum works very well.</li>
    <li> I really haven&#x27;t seen any change, have not used it that long! I do feel it tighten while drying.........just do not know enough to tell about it right now.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this really does anything it claims.  Everytime I use it, I say to myself what is it supposse to do becuase I do not see any kind of improvement.  Firming??? Hmmm.....Am I missing something here?  Ok I tried it but will not waste my money on ordering it again.</li>
    <li> First off I want say I am a man. I never cared for such things.&lt;br /&gt;But when I had lasik eye surgery and my glasses always hid the bags under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed how bad I looked with the bags under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;My wife helped me try a few things. Then I read about DMAE.&lt;br /&gt;This product has reduced the eye bags better then anything else I have tried at this point. I have ordered the&lt;br /&gt;Firming Eye Serum with Alpha Lipoic Acid Vitamin C Ester &amp; DMAE by Reviva also.&lt;br /&gt;I believe it will complete the process.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly as advertised.  Good results for the price</li>
    <li> I have been using this DMAE for sometime now and my face loves it. I get lots of compliments about my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I believe it is a mixture of the DMAE and Preperation H . Mix together, WOW</li>
    <li> This is perfectly suitable for a quick help as it makes for a decent tightening. happy with it ..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 61 and use this product as a final finish to my daily moisturizing. I&#x27;ve noticed a smoother, tighter look to my skin and everyone can&#x27;t believe my age so I must be doing something right with my skin care.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have super-high expectations for this. However, this morning, I notice that something looked significantly different - I realized it was that the rather unattractive number 11 between my eyebrows had softened a great deal. And this is with two days of use! The fluid has a nice &amp;#34;gel-ish&amp;#34; consistency and dries without stickiness. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Glass jar was broke when received, the liquid was all over. I just threw it in garbage I  was not  going through the trouble of  returning it. I didn&#x27;t know it was glass jar otherwise would have not ordered.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to really know if it works or not.</li>
    <li> I so no tangible difference in firming the skin, was disappointed in product, maybe the reason it did not work was because of the expiration date.  Would not purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> Great product! I noticed another poster saying this product peels when applying other products over this one. This only happens to me when I apply too much, use one pump only as that is how the fluid was made to be applied The key is to apply and let it soak in before the next product application, and also apply to cool skin. Another tip is to apply products thin to thick, clear to white for better absorption.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and it does not cause any breakouts for me. I had a lapse between bottles 1 and 2, and immediately saw the difference - made me a believer that is was def the firming fluid making the improvement, so I ordered it again. Skin is back to glowing again!</li>
    <li> So far I love every Reviva product I have purchased. This DMAE Firming Fluid is a very good buy. At 60 I do not expect a miracle, however since I&#x27;ve been using this product (I use it every morning under my Reviva moisturizer with sunscreen) my skin has noticeably improved. I am not one to fuss with beauty products and have a very simple regimen. A little of this product goes a long way. Don&#x27;t glop it on. Give it a few seconds before adding anything on top. If you use this product (along with hyraluronic acid at night) I&#x27;m sure you will see great results.</li>
    <li> This product left a rash on my chest and balls up when you put it elsewhere.  I feel like I am rubbing myself with useless silicone.</li>
    <li> OK this stuff is simply amazing. I am slated to get a neck lift in a month or two. I&#x27;ll still do this but now i&#x27;m wondering. That&#x27;s how good it is. I had a wonderful facelift years ago but my neck didn&#x27;t match at all. I looked 100 years old with my neck. Within a few days I saw this working and even wondered if I should get a neck lift? It really really works!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I can tell after using it for a couple weeks that my skin is firmer. I use it in combination with the firming eye cream.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a few years and I am really happy with it.</li>
    <li> Good product I have reordered</li>
    <li> Have been using for a week and so far it&#x27;s working.  My skin is looking tighter and more toned.  I&#x27;m hoping that continued use will really help my skin which is sun damaged and needs a lot of help.</li>
    <li> Love it use it all the time . I do have an issue on this delivery it broke in the delivery,&lt;br /&gt;and I&#x27;ve been asking to have it replaced .it&#x27;s still sealed but there&#x27;s only a third of it in the&lt;br /&gt;bottle it&#x27;s got a crack in it. I am still waiting.</li>
    <li> Not really what it&#x27;ssupposed to do. I am not happy with this product and do&#x27; not use it anymore</li>
    <li> This is one of the first eye creams I have ever enjoyed using without getting red eyes, itching, or discomfort. I had stopped using any eye creams due to unpleasant red eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on and disappears, does not migrate into the eye.  The small bottle with a pump is great for not contaminating the product and also getting out just a bit at a time. Light and without any perfumes. I have used it as an over all face moisturizer under make up while traveling (reduce the number of things I need to take with me). It works well for that also.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it as a good product at a rational price.</li>
    <li> I might just as well of whipped up some egg whites and put it on my neck. After it dries then it cracks and wrinkles then look worse than they did before I used the product.</li>
    <li> One squirt about the size of half of a pea is all you need.  I put this all over my just washed face in the a.m. and again in the p.m.  Then I apply my moisturizer.  I saw on Dr. Oz a few years ago that DMAE was good to use to help fight off wrinkles as you age.  I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in town, and finally thought to look on Amazon.  So glad I did. When I get low, I always order two, so that I have a back-up until I order again.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I was lucky to receive a sample of this from a Natural Products Expo, and fell in love with it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered from Amazon the very next day.&lt;br /&gt;I like how it tightens up my skin, making it look incredibly smooth, and feeling so soft.&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
    <li> Reviva, for OTC, is a great product and has been for years.  Acid balanced healthy products. I have been an esthetician for over 30 yrs and have always been impressed with Reviva quality.  That being said, this product, Firming Lotion, is NOT by any means a skin CARE product.  Its properties are fantastic for a TEMPORARY COSMETIC fix.  I liken it to using Prep H yrs ago to deflate eye bags. This stuff tightens and smooths but I sure would not sleep in it.  Even as a cosmetic, I suggest you experiment with the ratio of Firming Lotion to a good moisturizer or u will have white peeling cracks very shortly after application. It is great for even deep creases because it does stretch and hold the skin more smoothly for several hours...but reviewers who claim it has worked miracles on a permanent basis must be using Ponds Cold Cream for a moisturizer, if you get my drift. (If that sounds like you, this review is wasted). I love this stuff, I mix it with a good pH balanced healthy cream or serum, apply a thin coating and  then put makeup over.  BUT trust me, when I cleanse all the lift is GONE.  So be careful using it on a first date sleepover....you might put your friend into cardiac arrest when u step out of the shower,  all washed up the next morning!</li>
    <li> This is a great serum. Very good price for a product that works. It does a good job of firming.</li>
    <li> I received this a day early wow Tried it this morning and I could feel my skin tighten instantly. I think I&#x27;m going to love this product Thank You</li>
    <li> It really does tighten the skin and you can feel it.  I find it lasts for most of the day.  This one&#x27;s a keeper for me.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for several years and have always have had good results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Reviva products for years - until recently - when I noticed Sodium Benzoate is now among the ingredients.  This is a known carcinogen that converts to Benzene in the presence of Ascorbic Acid (Vit. C), something that is also found in skin care products.  I contacted the company and learned that, Yes, they changed the formulation but the preservatives represent a very small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The FDA has standards for the amount allowed in food and other products.  Problem for me is \\&quot;in aggregate\\&quot; how much are people getting from all the products they are consuming and applying? (Soda &amp; many other foods contain SB... And then there is the issue of combining such a skin care product with Sun exposure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a product junkie. I&#x27;m always searching for the magic potion that will make my skin look like it did 20 years ago. This product may not be magic, but it is a great product. It immediately tightened the skin under &amp; around my eyes and firmed my upper lip. My make-up goes on smoothly over it even without an additional moisturizer and the fine eye wrinkles seemed to diminish. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or heavy feeling on my skin...it just feels smooth and supple. Hopefully the results get even better with continued use.</li>
    <li> Does not do much for wrinkles.</li>
</ol>
