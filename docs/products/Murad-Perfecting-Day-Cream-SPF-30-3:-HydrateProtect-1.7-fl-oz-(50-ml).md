      <li>love it love it.</li>
      <li>I got the Murad Environmental Shield Intensive-C Radiance moisturizer and love that.</li>
      <li>and I love the products and love my skin.  </li>
      <li>Looking forward to purchasing more soon.</li>
      <li>I am 59 and have used this product for many years.  </li>
      <li>This stuff feeds my skin, reduces pore size, made the texture and color a hundred times better and its taking care of lines and wrinkles.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m guessing there is a better Murad product out there for my skin type</li>
      <li>What more could one ask for?  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love all the Murad products and this is no exception.  </li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t used it, me scared :)</li>
      <li>I am concerned now that this is authentic Murad product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many day cream..</li>
      <li>This is just okay.</li>
      <li>Light and nice.</li>
      <li>but I love it anyway.</li>
      <li>Love the stuff.</li>
      <li>Just an ok cream.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite Murad product.  </li>
      <li>My go-to moisturizer for many years.</li>
      <li>The product seems OK.</li>
      <li>My skin looks pretty good also.  </li>
      <li>I first purchased it from Salon Envy, and was very pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>Great protection from the sun, not greasy, makes my skin soft.</li>
      <li>I am 50 years old and I love their products!!</li>
      <li>It dispenses from the tube easily and is a high&lt;br /&gt;quality product.</li>
      <li>If you are thinking about trying this product I strongly suggest that you start with a trial/travel size.</li>
      <li>Even less impressed with the cost of it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, non-greasy and has SPF of 30.</li>
      <li>It is not to light and leaves my skin so soft!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It is good for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I like this moisturizer and have been using it for about two years, which I first purchased from my cosmetologist for $20 more than it is on Amazon.</li>
      <li>If you were unsure about the cream, then it would be best to apply it to small area of your skin.</li>
      <li>The sunblock is great and my face has never burned while wearing it, even when I apply SPF 100 to the rest of my body and still find ways of burning or turning pink.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not in love with them like I am with Rodan + Fields, but for the price I really do like them.  </li>
      <li>For what I have seen over a short course of time, this product has been good.</li>
      <li>cannot say enough good things about Murad.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell good like the regular day cream and it causes my skin to break out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This may be a great cream for other skin types but it didn&#x27;t work for my mother.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>well packed and shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>This line is my new love.</li>
      <li>This little tube is amazing; I love the Murad line.</li>
      <li>I took this day cream (as part of a Murad sample kit) with me on a cruise and found that my makeup looked amazing and lasted longer than it ever has without needing to be retouched or blotted in any way 12 hours later...</li>
      <li>I love the way it makes my face feel incredibly soft.</li>
      <li>After a month of using the Day cream and its companion resurgence night cream I can see visible improvement in the diminishment of these lines and some permanent laugh lines on the plateaus of my face.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my forties and rarely have to wear make up.</li>
      <li>I have used this product before and liked it enough to purchase it again.</li>
      <li>My skin is oily on it&#x27;s own, so I don&#x27;t need the extra shine.  </li>
      <li>first inspection, the cream/lotion is nice and thick, on application, it spreads well and gives a nice sheen as it moisturises the skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s greasy and oily on my face and doesn&#x27;t feel right under my make-</li>
      <li>It smooths on like a liquid and has the right amount of sunscreen for my face and neck.  </li>
      <li>This is very much Partners’</li>
      <li>There is a slight - but nice smell, which is not unpleasant.</li>
      <li>I chose to rate 4 stars b/c I have only been using it for about 3 weeks so far; however, in that time, I spent a week or so at the beach, and the spf worked great!  </li>
      <li>I love the feel of the cream and it settles my red and irritated skin from using retin A at night.</li>
      <li>If it is all psychological then that&#x27;s good enough for me.  </li>
      <li>The cream with a useful SPF 30 should give decent UV protection for me the sun protection factor really works well.</li>
      <li>I would give this 5 stars if it helped with my dry skin more.</li>
      <li>It was much cheaper to buy it then through the spas price of 75.00.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Seems to work well. Doesn&#x27;t ball up when putting on foundation. Not too shiny, but gives some gloss. Received in late March, expiration date was April 2015.</li>
    <li> I first used this product when I had a facial. I really like how it hydrated my skin and had a +30 sunscreen in it. It was much cheaper to buy it then through the spas price of 75.00.</li>
    <li> a bit oily but works great for my skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many day cream..none worked..it would either be oily or dry but this one is just right. Doesn&#x27;t leave a pinkish or brownish shade either which is awesome.</li>
    <li> love the smell.  I have sensitive skin and this works perfect.  Leaves my skin glowing</li>
    <li> This may be a great cream for other skin types but it didn&#x27;t work for my mother.  She is 64 and has olive color combination skin.  She used it only twice and it made her skin red and dry.  Her forehead (which is normally oily) started to peel.  Her face was itchy so she had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> This little tube is amazing; I love the Murad line. Moisturizing without bring heavy or greasy. It absorbs quickly. Also, great shopping experience- great price, well packed and shipped quickly. What more could one ask for?  Looking forward to purchasing more soon.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and liked it enough to purchase it again. It dispenses from the tube easily and is a high&lt;br /&gt;quality product. It feels good and helps retain moisture all day.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what is in this stuff. It is different than the normal day moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t smell good like the regular day cream and it causes my skin to break out.&lt;br /&gt;I have been pretty disappointed overall in the performance of all the Murad products.  When I get through what I bought I am going back to Clinique.</li>
    <li> Awesome lotion, not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> All like all of their products that I have tried. This one is not greasy at all. Light and nice.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer! It soaks right in never making me feel like I am too dry or too greasy. It has an SPF 30 which I need because I tan routinely. I am 30 and probably dont need this yet but I love it anyway. I love the way it makes my face feel incredibly soft. I do rotate it with the ageless acne when I am experienceing my hormonal \\&quot;girl time\\&quot;. It helps with the breakouts. You wont be disappointed with this product, if you are I will buy it from you!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but very thick and makes face shiny</li>
    <li> This is a great product! My skin was dry and peeling during the dry winter.  It was also rough as I have had problems with acne and still have plenty of acne marks.  After using this for a few months, my skin is dramatically smoother! Very soft to touch and I have gotten compliments that it is \\&quot;glowing\\&quot;.  I love the SPF--which is def a must for day cream and can help protect the dark acne marks.  Marks are clearing as well.  I am also using the Essential C night cream which probably has an added benefit.  With daily use, this tube has lasted ~ 4 months-so definitely worth the money!  Do it!</li>
    <li> My go-to moisturizer for many years. Great protection from the sun, not greasy, makes my skin soft.</li>
    <li> Great for the face. A little bit goes a long way. Be careful around your eyes.</li>
    <li> Great skin moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Great, lightweight moisturizer. Unscented which is really nice.</li>
    <li> Soaks in a d dries easily, not sticky</li>
    <li> Love this! Makes my skin look even and flawless. I use it after washing with Origins Checks and Balance. Makes my makeup last longer. Decreases redness. Feels and smells great. Only need a tiny bit so it last very long. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is very much Partners’ review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On first inspection, the cream/lotion is nice and thick, on application, it spreads well and gives a nice sheen as it moisturises the skin. There is a slight - but nice smell, which is not unpleasant. If you were unsure about the cream, then it would be best to apply it to small area of your skin. The cream with a useful SPF 30 should give decent UV protection for me the sun protection factor really works well. The cream itself absorbs in fast, non-greasy and does not leave a white film. I found that it Lasts all day with or without makeup. It keeps my skin soft and hydrated - without felling heavy and greasy. So far, the only downside is it is pricey. Therefore, I will see how long the tube lasts before making a decision to go forward and using this product line long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have commented there are other products out there that “claim” to do the same thing, however they are cheaper, products out there, to buy and use long term to get full benefits. For what I have seen over a short course of time, this product has been good.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  It&#x27;s not cheap but it&#x27;s worth it.  It&#x27;s light, non-greasy and has SPF of 30.</li>
    <li> Very light, not greasy. May clog Korea for people with sensitive skin. I live in a very dry climate, so can&#x27;t speak for other areas. But worked well for summer in the desert.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Murad product.  It smooths on like a liquid and has the right amount of sunscreen for my face and neck.  Good job, Murad!!</li>
    <li> This is just okay. It smells like sunscreen and it is somewhat oily. I&#x27;ll finish this bottle but not worth purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I love this product. This is the best lotion and my skin is glowing. I highly recommend this product. And believe me I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different ones.</li>
    <li> Been using Murad products for decades and I love the products and love my skin.  Got a great price on Amazon -- and believe me, I shop around.  Used to get the best prices from Canada, but not any more.</li>
    <li> This lotion has not improved the quality of my skin and I&#x27;ve used it for over two months at altitude. I only apply it after a shower with hopes to see an improvement. Today I made the decision to stop using it all together. I accidentally rubbed some near my eye...my eye was irritated and red for over two hours. I am worried that the skin around my eyes is too sensitive for this type of moisturizer. Time to find a new brand!</li>
    <li> Received open! No bueno! What if someone else use it??? What if it&#x27;s something else in it??? Haven&#x27;t used it, me scared :)</li>
    <li> This product is a day moisturizer with an spf.  I use it during the day under makeup.  It works great.  My makeup looks good over it.  My skin looks pretty good also.  So with the spf it is just what I needed.  I would buy it again, particularly at Amazon prices.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect day cream with SPF 30!  It is not to light and leaves my skin so soft!&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say enough good things about Murad.  I am 50 years old and I love their products!!</li>
    <li> This is ok moisturizer, not sure I&#x27;ll buy it again. I did have some breakouts, might look into an oil-free version.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that doesn&#x27;t make me breakout and provides cover all day long. My mom recommended this product to me and now I am hooked.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product that had sun protection that I could use on my sensitive skin on  my face. It is hard to find one I can use every day an not have breakouts. This products works for me. It goes on as a heavy white cream that is alittle greasy but does work in and does well. I have not had a sunburn on my face all summer with this product.</li>
    <li> Just an ok cream. I read the reviews and felt temped to try it, but I&#x27;m not impressed with it. Maybe it&#x27;s not compatible with my combination skin.</li>
    <li> Great day cream and under-makeup skin-care product.  Skin looks great with just the cream and no make up.  At 55+ I&#x27;ll take all the skin care help that works!  Love the stuff.</li>
    <li> The cheap price made me skeptical. But I believe this is the same cream they sell at spas for twice the amount. It instantly moisturizes and brightens my skin. I&#x27;ve become addicted.</li>
    <li> Yes, it was &amp;#34;as expected&amp;#34;. I first purchased it from Salon Envy, and was very pleased with it.  Warning, do not get it near your eye or it will burn forever !</li>
    <li> very nice and light. It doesn&#x27;t make you feel like you wear heavy cream.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell of this product, I&#x27; would not recommend this one, due to the smell of it alone.</li>
    <li> This cream absolutely destroyed my skin, gave me sores on my face.  I have never had a reaction like this from other brands.  This is a premium brand that I splurged for to improve my skin and it is much worse now then before I started using this product.  If you are thinking about trying this product I strongly suggest that you start with a trial/travel size.</li>
    <li> I took this day cream (as part of a Murad sample kit) with me on a cruise and found that my makeup looked amazing and lasted longer than it ever has without needing to be retouched or blotted in any way 12 hours later... even with the humid ocean air surrounding me.  The SPF is a bonus.  I havn&#x27;t been using it long enough to ascertain whether it is improving the texture of my skin, to be honest, but wanted to share the news about it acting as a primer.  Hopefully this will save you some cash vs. purchasing a separate primer.</li>
    <li> I love this hydrating cream with all the SPF I could need and without the smell of sunscreen!  It goes on smooth and hydrates quickly without leaving and grease or shine or smell behind.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about this product.  It went on really thick and didn&#x27;t seem to absorb.  I got the Murad Environmental Shield Intensive-C Radiance moisturizer and love that.</li>
    <li> I am new to Murad and thought I would like this product.  I&#x27;ve liked all the others I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;m not in love with them like I am with Rodan + Fields, but for the price I really do like them.  This Perfecting Day Cream is the exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for about 2 weeks and hate what I&#x27;m finding.  It&#x27;s thick and goes on well but it leaves my skin with a very bright shine to it.  My skin is oily on it&#x27;s own, so I don&#x27;t need the extra shine.  I&#x27;m guessing there is a better Murad product out there for my skin type and I have ordered one, but it hasn&#x27;t come in yet.  I use the shine control and I feel like using it with this moisturizer just defeats the purpose.  It&#x27;s greasy and oily on my face and doesn&#x27;t feel right under my make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have super dry skin, this might be the product for you.  Give it a try.  With Amazon Prime you can always send it back if you hate it.  (Shout out to Amazon Prime!)  But if you have oily or combination skin, I would steer clear of this one and try another by Murad.</li>
    <li> I really do love this! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 years and won&#x27;t use anything else. I order from Amazon because I don&#x27;t have access to Murad at a store (where I live). I appreciate the low price and convenience of Amazon.</li>
    <li> My skin absorbs this product so well.</li>
    <li> This is the only face cream my husband will use. He has had very bad sling for a long time and this product line changed his complexion completely! He will not use anything else!!</li>
    <li> I have used the range of Murad products for a long time. I use the day and night perfecting creams. Great stuff. The day cream had pale grey coloring on the tube and the night cream had burgundy coloring on the tube. With this last amazon order the day cream had the burgundy coloring ? A major cosmetic company does not get their branding wrong. I am concerned now that this is authentic Murad product. The product seems OK.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of the cream and it settles my red and irritated skin from using retin A at night.</li>
    <li> I have acne prone oily skin and use murad with a couple of other skin care products.  High end skin care benefits for a great price!  Protects and doesn&#x27;t break me out.  Also works wonderfully with makeup.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> A wonderful moisturizer that is absorbed quickly and leaves skin dewey; give it a couple of minutes and makeup just glides on beautifully.</li>
    <li> It is good for my sensitive skin. I can use under the makeup or alone. I Iike it but a little expensive.</li>
    <li> I like this moisturizer and have been using it for about two years, which I first purchased from my cosmetologist for $20 more than it is on Amazon. The sunblock is great and my face has never burned while wearing it, even when I apply SPF 100 to the rest of my body and still find ways of burning or turning pink. It&#x27;s not great for dry skin days, but I haven&#x27;t found anything as light feeling with sunblock abilities that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I would give this 5 stars if it helped with my dry skin more.</li>
    <li> This company makes cleansers that really make your skin glow and youthful.  This perfecting cream is my favorite because of the youthful glow I get instead of the dry leather effect from old weather beaten skin. I&#x27;m in my forties and rarely have to wear make up. This is the thing to use to grow older gracefully.</li>
    <li> I love all the Murad products and this is no exception.  I have bought this twice already and will probably buy it again..</li>
    <li> IT BURNS MY EYES EVEN IF I KEEP IT ONLY ON MY CHEEK BONES AND LOWER.  I WOULDN&#x27;T RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Have all the resurgence line and several of the perfecting products. This stuff feeds my skin, reduces pore size, made the texture and color a hundred times better and its taking care of lines and wrinkles. Have a bad line from lip to chin. Had it botoxed and wasn&#x27;t impressed. Even less impressed with the cost of it. Now the wrinkle is about %75 gone. Use a Palovia laser and NuFace, but burned my face with the laser and had to lay off for 3 weeks. Murad doesn&#x27;t burn, dry, peel. Has no side effects. It protects and takes care of my skin. This line is my new love.</li>
    <li> I used some other kinds of brands, good ones, but, I have been using this one for almost  2months, it is WONDERFUL,  it continues to work everyday for my needs. love it love it.</li>
    <li> I am 59 and have used this product for many years.  It is an excellent moisturizer that is not at all greasy.</li>
    <li> I chose to rate 4 stars b/c I have only been using it for about 3 weeks so far; however, in that time, I spent a week or so at the beach, and the spf worked great!  I have also noticed it helping with hydration and some decrease in dark spots.</li>
    <li> I was looking for help in softening the lines above my lips.  After a month of using the Day cream and its companion resurgence night cream I can see visible improvement in the diminishment of these lines and some permanent laugh lines on the plateaus of my face.  I keep thinking I am making this up when I look in the mirror and can hardly believe a cream could possibly affect the natural lines of aging.  The proof is in the pudding.  If it is all psychological then that&#x27;s good enough for me.  I only know when I look in the mirror I am not focusing on these lines because they are simply disappearing.  Going to keep using this product.  I am sixty years old this year.</li>
