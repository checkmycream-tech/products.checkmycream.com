    <li> worked well as usual no complaints</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner.  I conditioner my hair once a week and I love the way this conditioner makes my hair feel.  It&#x27;s a great value for the money and it doesn&#x27;t smell like garlic at all.</li>
    <li> This site sells this product cheaper than the beauty supply stores!  I read all the reviews and decided to invest because I purchased MT and garlic pills.  When I do my co wash I detangle then rinse out conditioner then apply MT and Aphogee essential oils to my scalp wait a few min. Rinse out and apply Alter Ego.  It smells good and my hair is stronger after use.  I will continue to buy this oil treatment forever. I love it!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!! even use it on a daily as hair creme to weight my hair down...better than the other gunk i use &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over 5 years now and its kept my hair shiny and healthy. It&#x27;s never let me down!</li>
    <li> Hello all:  Hope everyone is well. I tried Alter Ego Garlic Hot Oil Treatment and first of all it does not smell like garlic, but has a very pleasant smell and when you mush it all in your scalp and hair, your hair becomes soft like butter!  It&#x27;s great!  Then, when you blow out your hair, it&#x27;s soft, shiny, bouncy and smells fresh and clean.  I keep a jar handy always.  After shampooing, just put on soaking wet hair and really massage in scalp and then hair.  You can also do a deep condition with it.  Instead of rinsing out, just leave it on and clip hair up and rinse out later.  It&#x27;s even better!  You can&#x27;t buy in stores, but only on line or in certain salons.  I&#x27;ll always purchase this.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> If you are seriously looking for a product that will make your hair look healthy and silky, definitely try this conditioner. I do use it in combination with other products such as Keracare hydrating shampoo, prowash leave-in conditioner and FHI flat iron protectant or biosilk.  I also leave the alter ego conditioner on (with a plastic cap) for as long as I can -- maybe an hour or two. If I am short on time I will sit under my dryer for 5-10 minutes. And then proceed as normal.  My hair comes out very flowy and manageable. If you are in search of something new and different that TRULY works, definitely give this a try.</li>

    <li> I like this product, I have used it for two months and my hair is softer by far.  It can leave hair very greasy if you don&#x27;t rinse very well.  When you think you have rinsed completely rinse again.  Don&#x27;t worry it does NOT smell like garlic not even a little. I would buy it again even though its pricy its a great conditioner.  My hair is borderline mature so I need a conditioner that does what it claims.  I was buying Aveda and I like this much better.</li>
    <li> i use this 1or 2x/mnth when i want nice shiny hair. Works great. I blow dry my hair and have color and this is a great product.</li>
    <li> It leaves your hair soft and extremely moisturized.  I loved it and will continue to purchase it and use.  Works great on damaged hair.</li>

    <li> My daughter used it mostly. She said it was ok. Rated it 3.5 stars. It made her hair manageable and softer, but no drastic difference.</li>
    <li> I recommend conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Good for split ends, adds volume and shine after one use.  This product is popular in all dominican salon</li>
    <li> Got it as a gift for someone for their birthday. I did not use it but my friend says it is a great product, makes her hair soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping with quick!</li>

    <li> Product keeps the hair moisturized, soft, shiny and helps reduce breakage.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like garlic to me and the ladies at the salon I go to (Dominican)swear by it.  I really can&#x27;t think of any cons for this product because I notice that my hair looks healthier, fuller, and feels softer after I began using it.</li>
    <li> excellent product, esp when used with Alter Ego Energizing  Shampoo, works excellent when only left in for 5 min, cant wait to leave it in for 15 min</li>
