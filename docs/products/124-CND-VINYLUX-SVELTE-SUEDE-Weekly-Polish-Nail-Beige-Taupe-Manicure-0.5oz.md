      <li>Now I use Vinylux Polish + The weekly top coat.</li>

      <li>but it was more brown.</li>

      <li>I just clean my nails with rubbing alcohol before applying the colour.</li>
      <li>have purchased other colors &amp; happy with this.</li>

<li> I&#x27;m hard on nail polish and am surprised that the coats last so long!  </li>
<li> This Svelte suede was a little different from what I imagined from the picture.</li>
<li> have kept it on for almost 3 weeks with minimal chipping.</li>
<li> A good neutral color but boring on my medium yellow skin tone.  </li>
<li> It lasts longer than any other polish</li>
<li> If you expect total salon quality, you might be a little disappointed, but it is still better than your average everyday nail polish.</li>
<li> I have pale skin with pink undertones.</li>
<li> but I wanted a pale pink.  </li>
<li> You polish your nail and in less than 10 minutes you are out the door!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t look bad, it just doesn&#x27;t really add anything and feels a bit &amp;#34;blah&amp;#34; to me.</li>
<li> not sure what the difference is.</li>
<li> My bottle did not perform as well as my usual CND polish</li>
<li> It is hard to decide on the colors not having seen them in person</li>
<li> but I also have very weak nails that peel.</li>
<li> Sorry.</li>
<li> This polish wasn&#x27;t bad for the price.</li>
<li> I just hate the color.</li>

    <li> Love this color. It&#x27;s natural.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hard on nail polish and am surprised that the coats last so long!  Usually after three or four days the tips of my nails are free of polish with numerous chips.  This polish is lasting more than a week without chips or wear.  After that I just need to lightly brush the tips of my nails.</li>
    <li> the colors are great in this genre of polish and should be applied exactly as directions state and you will love it.</li>
    <li> chips like a bowl of Doritos;  The color is great, but it still peels and chips like regular polish.  Sorry.</li>
    <li> While I love the weekly polish, this color is not what it appears to be in the photo on Amazon. It is a taupe/grey color. Really Amazon? Take a better picture!!! This company does not do returns so I am stuck with it.</li>
    <li> color is not what it appears</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t look in person the way it looked in the picture.</li>
    <li> I continue to purchase this polish in different colors.  It lasts longer than any other polish</li>
    <li> It is easy to apply  and is long lasting about two weeks. The colors are very pleaseing. The top coat is very important for the staying powder.</li>
    <li> nice color, doesn&#x27;t last a week</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish!  I started using it at my nail place and it definitely stays on longer than regular nail polish.</li>
    <li> Manicure really only lasts about 4 days tops but it&#x27;s better than normal polish.  This is a great nude for my ivory skin.</li>
    <li> I love these weekly nail polishes. I got several colours and they last for at least a week when used with the top coat. I just clean my nails with rubbing alcohol before applying the colour. This Svelte suede was a little different from what I imagined from the picture. I thought it was going to be pinker but it was more brown. It was still a very nice color.</li>
    <li> Great everyday color! Good coverage with 2 - 3 coats.</li>
    <li> I just hate the color. It does NOT look the same when you get it. It is actually very brown in color. It looks nude in this picture. This product is however, phenomenal!!</li>
    <li> not as durable as I thought would be but nice color.</li>
    <li> Stays on much longer than regular polish.  My manicurist used it on my nails and I was so pleased that I purchased it online and use it between nail appointments.</li>
    <li> Love this color .. And this stuff stays chip free for a whole week .. Promise</li>
    <li> A good neutral color. My bottle did not perform as well as my usual CND polish not sure what the difference is.</li>
    <li> Long wear polish.&lt;br /&gt;Neutral color. lasts several days without chips. It is hard to decide on the colors not having seen them in person but it turned out ok :)</li>
    <li> I recently used a Groupon to visit a salon for a manicure and pedicure.  The salon uses this product so I thought it was worth a try.  Not only do I love the colors; but the product stays on the longest of any regular polish I can find.  I am very pleased with how long this product stays; no chips at all.</li>
    <li> Looks like a gel manicure.</li>
    <li> Color is a bit too beige for me. I think it could be very lovely with the right skin tone. I have pale skin with pink undertones. It doesn&#x27;t look bad, it just doesn&#x27;t really add anything and feels a bit &amp;#34;blah&amp;#34; to me.</li>
    <li> My 3-star rating is primarily because of the color.  It seems a bit too &amp;#34;grayish&amp;#34; for my taste.  I think it would be advisable to be able to &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; this shade before purchase.  It may/may not look good on your skin tone.  I do not recommend this unless you know that you need this particular shade.</li>
    <li> The picture looks more pink, but the actual polish is brown.  A nice neutral, but I wanted a pale pink.  The polish lasted over 1 week on my nails without chipping.  A record for me.  I like the brand, just not this color.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great polish.  Stays on easily for more than a week.  Was not quite beige enough.  More on the taupe side.</li>
    <li> Nice neutral color, easy to apply, use with the Vinalux top coat, lasts 7 days. I will defiantly be purchasing more of these products.</li>
    <li> This polish wasn&#x27;t bad for the price. It didn&#x27;t stay perfect for the whole 7 days but I also have very weak nails that peel.</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed by this because I really wanted an easy alternative.  I applied two coats, and the vinyl top coat.  It was peeling by the end of the day.  I have much better results with regular nail polish.</li>
    <li> Excelente ... super fast delivered</li>
    <li> The first nail polish that lasted more than 2 days on my nails.  It lasts 5-6 days on my nails.</li>
    <li> Great wearability! It lasts me a week.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite nail polish! Stays for a week and brilliant color!</li>
    <li> Truly lasted a week! Great for vacation,not even a touch up needed.</li>
    <li> I purchased the top coat as well and followed all the instructions. It didn&#x27;t even stay on for two days. I gave it another shot when I got a manicure and it was still the same.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It will last a full seven days without a doubt.</li>
    <li> I love these products. You polish your nail and in less than 10 minutes you are out the door!&lt;br /&gt;This color Svelte Suede is a more yellow/tan color for a French or on its own for a natural&lt;br /&gt;look.</li>
    <li> LOVE this polish. Bye bye OPI</li>
    <li> From the picture, this appears to be a peachy shade of tan but it is definitely more on the taupe side. A good neutral color but boring on my medium yellow skin tone.  I lightly file my nails every three days or so to keep them looking sharp. Doing this I believe helped the polish look fresh longer. Didn&#x27;t change polish for 9 days.</li>
    <li> This polish really does stay looking like new for at least a week. No base coat required and easy application...2 coats and a top coat. You must be sure to purchase the topcoat. That&#x27;s really the key to its lasting quality and shine.</li>
    <li> This is just why I ordered vinyl ux.  have purchased other colors &amp; happy with this.</li>
    <li> This brand last for a week at least, the color is very natural and the service was great</li>
    <li> Designed to be an alternative to salon gel nails, I think this is a good product. It worked as promised and lasted 5 days before beginning to chip. The color is great for summer, and the ease of use makes it a worthwhile purchase. If you expect total salon quality, you might be a little disappointed, but it is still better than your average everyday nail polish.</li>
    <li> I used to use OPI Gel polish- Now I use Vinylux Polish + The weekly top coat. It wears so well!&lt;br /&gt;I have kept it on for almost 3 weeks with minimal chipping. Highly recommend for busy folks who want a&lt;br /&gt;clean Gel-like/Acrylic look.</li>
    <li> Great nail polish, lasts for about 2 weeks.</li>
