<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I received a free sample of the Crest Pro Health Tartar protection rinse from Smiley 360 about a week ago. I figured it would be like any other mouthwash I have tried in the past. Boy! Was I wrong! This is the freshest, non-burning rinse I have ever used! The fluoride and the tartar protection is also a big plus. Thank you, Crest, for making a great product!</li>
    <li> I got my free bottle to try from smiley360!! I was so happy about how it tatsed and best of all it did not burn!!!</li>
    <li> I received this free sample via Smiley360.  I have to say that it is one of the best mouth rinses that I have never used.  It leaves you feeling nice and clean with no bad after taste.</li>
    <li> I received Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection Rinse from Smiley360 for free to sample, my whole family including the kids love using it! It has a great taste that isn&#x27;t too strong &amp; leaves your mouth feeling super fresh. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample from Smiley360 and began using it the first day it arrived. The first time I tried it, immediately my mouth felt fresher! At first, your tongue begins to tingle and you are hit with a minty wave. Once you begin using it more often, the tingling  ends and you just swish happily knowing your teeth are getting treated right. When you have finished using the rinse, you aren&#x27;t allowed to drink/eat anything for half an hour, which is not hard to do when you are brushing first thing in the morning and then before heading to bed at night. It&#x27;s a wonderful feeling to begin your day and then later off to sleep knowing your mouth is completely clean and feeling fresh! This is a wonderful product that I highly recommend if you want to enjoy a cool minty fresh mouth that will make you smile for hours on end!</li>
    <li> got this product free from smiley360.com for testing purposes. I like it. It helps protect my teeth and prevent cavities and freshens breath</li>
    <li> Much better than the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; brand and the whole family likes it.  Nice lid too.  Easy to get on and off.</li>
    <li> I have been using Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection Rins for about 3 nights now and I can assure you my mouth is fresher and my teeth are brighter. It is simple to use, not time consuming just a few minutes a day and WOW results. I can see results and it has only been 3 nights. This is a great product , i  received a FREE sample from Smiley360</li>
    <li> I got a full sized free sample from Smiley360 and my first impressions of Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection is very positive.  The taste is very pleasing and my mouth feels very clean after using.  Highly recommend this to anyone who uses a mouthwash.</li>
    <li> I got this product free from smiley360.com for testing purposes. I Love it. The dentist even noticed a difference! That speaks a lot.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy Crest Pro-health tarter Protection. My mouth feels very refreshed and clean after I use it. I have tried other brands but nothing compares to the freshness I feel when using this.</li>
    <li> I recieved the Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection Rinse free from Smiley360 to test and give my own opinion on the product..Too my surprise it taste good and leaves my breath smelling fresh..It&#x27;s not strong like some other mouth rinse...I would remmond the Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection Rinse to my family and friends...Very good product that would protect from getting tartar,</li>
    <li> I received this product, for free, from Smiley360. However, any opinions I post are strictly my own.&lt;br /&gt; Our family has a variety of needs and preferences, when it comes to dental care. My fiance likes brands that taste good and leave his breath smelling fresh for a long time. I need extra cavity protection, as I have sensitive teeth from thin enamel, but most of the minty brands that he likes are too intense for my dental sensitivity. Our oldest daughter has bleeding gums, so she needs something that won&#x27;t irritate her mouth but STILL offers tartar control. Our youngest has great teeth, takes care of them well but is sensitive to the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; of most mouthwashes.&lt;br /&gt;At last, Crest has made a product that we can ALL use.&lt;br /&gt;It has a fresh, minty flavor that isn&#x27;t overpowering but it leaves your mouth feeling clean (and smelling great) for hours. It has the fluoride and tartar protection that our oldest and I need, with far less &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; than most products. (*Note: I say &amp;#34;far less&amp;#34; because there still is SOME burn on our tongues, but it is FAR less intense than most of the products I have tried, and fades quickly. By far, the &amp;#34;alcohol-free&amp;#34; mouthwashes offer the most honest claims of &amp;#34;no burn,&amp;#34; but they all seem very watery, to me, and the results just aren&#x27;t as effective*).&lt;br /&gt;As an added bonus, this product offers protection against stains. This is really a plus, for us, as we drink a LOT of iced tea and coffee.&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, we are very happy with the quality of this mouthwash... especially since we now only have to buy one brand instead of three or four!</li>
    <li> I was able to test out Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection from Smiley360 for free, but I want you to know--this review is totally my opinion. So, I&#x27;m pretty picky about teeth cleaning in my house. I brush twice a day, and floss often (not nearly as much as I should) but I usually get decent reviews from the dentist, but they still have to do my cleaning. Well--just so happens I had my 6 month checkup/cleaning last week and it really went much quicker. I told my dentist about the rinse I was using, and she said &amp;#34;Keep up the good work!&amp;#34; I tell you what, if I have to spend less time in the dentist chair I&#x27;m going to keep on using it. Plus it tastes great, and leaves my mouth feeling fresh WITHOUT A BURN! (y&#x27;all that use mouthwash know what I mean!) Two thumbs up and a pearly white smile from this girl for the Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection Mouthwash!</li>
    <li> I loved that this mouthwash isn&#x27;t too strong yet provides my mouth with top of the notch tartar protection.</li>
    <li> I have tried many brands of mouthwash. This is by far the most pleasant tasting and most effective!! Leaves breathe fresh and no burning!!</li>
    <li> I have always used listerine until I received the Crest Pro-health.  I love the taste, and I love the way it makes my mout feel.  I got this product free from smiley360.com for testing purposes</li>
    <li> I got to try a bottle of this Crest mouthwash free from Smiley 360. I really like it! It has a nice flavor that is not overwhelming or harsh, and it doesn&#x27;t sting. Both of these things make it very easy to swish with it for the recommended amount of time. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection Rinse. I don&#x27;t like the burning sensation or the overall taste. It did leave my mouth feeling clean and fresh. I can&#x27;t say how well it does on tartar control since I haven&#x27;t used it long enough, but I can say I won&#x27;t continue using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a free, full-sized sample from Smiley360 for review purposes. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I like this Crest Pro-Health rinse, it definitely made my mouth feel clean and fresh for using. It is not as harsh as another brand out there. I would definitely recommend Crest Pro-health rinse to friends. I received a free sample from Smiley360. All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for a month before my bi-annual dentist appt and was really happy with the results. My teeth felt cleaner and my appt time was cut in half as the hygienist didn&#x27;t have nearly as much work to do! I was able to try this product for free through smiley 360, but the opinion is my own.</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary bottle of Crest ProHealth Tartar Protection for the purposes of review but my opinions are 100% my own.I  love this amazing rinse, my teeth and mouth feel fresh and clean and wonderful. My breath smells minty for a long time after rinsing.My dentist will be happy with me that I am using this Anticavity Fluroide Rinse and my teeth already are.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! My mouth feels immediately clean when using it! And my husband loves to kiss me after too. :) I usually use the alcohol free mouthwashes because most with alcohol taste awful - but this one does not! I was very pleasantly pleased. All in all, it works great, tastes great, and has no aftertaste! A+ from me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a FREE sample of this from Smiley360 and Crest - but will be a longtime customer!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product and to top it all off my kids love it as well. They are so picky when it comes to the different  mouthwashes and toothpastes. Go ahead and try it you&#x27;ll love it !!!!</li>
    <li> i love this mouthwash .it has a nice flavor but it does burn a lil i thought it wouldnt because of the no alcohol but not too bad will be using this product again I got this from Smiley360 used all my coupons. MY two cousins love this product as well as my family</li>
    <li> I recieved this product for free from smiley360.com to sample. I love this product. It does not burn at all. It is safe for my 6 year old as well.</li>
    <li> I love this product it has your teeth feeling and smelling so clean and fresh! I got this product for free from Smiley360</li>
    <li> I got my free bottle to try from smiley360!! I was so surprised how clean and great my mouth felt after use!! Did not burn my mouth!! Love it!! Awesome product!! Very tasty!!! I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I really like using this Crest Pro-Health Tarter Protection because you can actually feel it working. It is not at all intense like the other leading mouthwashes, and left my mouth feeling clean and refreshed. It comes with a handy cap that can be used as a small cup, which is a great feature to measure it out with. My 15 year old used to use another name brand mouthwash and said he&#x27;d try it, he&#x27;d rather use this one now instead, another great plus if you know teenagers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Mouthwash,  Great Name Brand,  great job Crest&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I received this product for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.\\&quot;</li>

I have a hard time getting my kids to use a mouthwash, because they do not like that burning feeling that some mouthwashes have - but, they will use this one....so that is saying something good about this product.&lt;br /&gt;I think most people who try this will feel the same way - that it is a great mouth rinse, and tastes great too.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this mouthwash from Smiley360. I like the fresh, clean taste left in my mouth. I particularly enjoy that my mouth isn&#x27;t burning like it would if I used Listerine. I can swish for 30 seconds without my eyes tearing up!</li>
    <li> I recently received a free sample of Crest Pro-Health from smiley360. It was fantastic. The flavour is great and it left my mouth feeling ultra clean. I switched from my regular product to Crest!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I received my product just 1 day before my scheduled dental cleaning. So after my cleaning, I had a &amp;#34;clean slate&amp;#34; to start off my mission. I&#x27;ve been using it daily since my professional cleaning and am looking forward to my next cleaning to see if I have less tartar. (Hopefully)&lt;br /&gt;I liked that it doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth and is gentle and effective. It has a pleasant taste &amp; pretty color. I generally like to use the caps to measure out mouthwashes, but the cap on this product didn&#x27;t have a dosage line (I think that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s called) and a cap that I could use to drink the liquid from. So I just had to use a separate cup.&lt;br /&gt;I like the Crest Pro Health line of products to help keep my mouth clean and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product for free (From Smiley 360) for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample from Smilie360. I have to first say that I am a brand snob when it comes to mouthwash but I really did like this product. It did not sting and made my breath fresh. Not as long lasting as I would like but the tarter protection is a bonus. It seems this is a lot better for my teeth than other products I have tried in the past.</li>
    <li> I like the taste and it isn&#x27;t overwhelming.  Works great.  Only hard part is getting into the routine of using regularly.</li>
    <li> I loved the Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection with Fluoride Anticavity Rinse because it is very clean and fresh. The invigorating sensation will leave your mouth fresh while you transform your oral health into Pro-Health. I received mine free from Smiley360 but I will definitely be a return customer. I always buy 2 of everything at a time and this will be no different. The freshness lasts for the most part of the day and the best part is it is protecting you mouth all day.</li>
    <li> Perfect timing for receiving this free sample of Crest Pro-Health. My dentist recommended a fluoride rinse for extra protection. The sample same from Smiley360 just days later. Has a very cool and refreshing taste. Next dental visit is sure to be a good one.</li>
    <li> I received a free bottle from Smiley360! The bottle did not last long in my house since everyone wanted to try it. I will buying even more of this very soon.</li>
    <li> I love this mouth rinse, it is got the right amount of mint, and I am in love with this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great mouthwash. It leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean. It doesn&#x27;t have that harsh, alcohol taste to it. My teeth are looking better after only a few weeks of using this product daily. I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good mouthwash that isn&#x27;t overpowering!!</li>
    <li> Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection with Flouride Antiactivity Flouride Rinse:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product.

But, with Crest Pro-Health we do not need to do that, we can pore it into a glass, and rinse our mouths.  It works, and it tastes awesome, so that is a WIN/WIN situation for me and my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product description:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest Pro-Health Complete Rinse gives you six benefits in one rinse, for a more complete way to get better dental checkups.*&lt;br /&gt;*vs. brushing alone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rebuilds Teeth Enamel Helps Prevent Cavities Cleans Teeth &amp; Gums Kills Bad Breath Germs Freshens Breath No Burn of Alcohol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even my husband loves this moutwash, and he is very particular about what he likes, loves this mouthwash.

    <li> I have been a crest user for years and really noticed a difference in how clean my mouth feels! The taste is good and really does make your mouth feel healthier. I got a bottle for free for sharing my opinion and am so glad I did, my household will not be without this now.</li>
    <li> This Crest mouth rinse is perfect for me. It has a great cool taste and refreshes my mouth for hours. It got an easy measuring cup and makes my oral hygiene routine easier and more fun. It&#x27;s really great to eliminate the last germs where the brush can&#x27;t reach. High five for this one for quality and value!</li>
    <li> I got this product free from smiley360.com for testing purposes. I Love it. It helps protect my teeth and prevent cavities.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product from Smiley360 and was very happy to try it. It leaves your mouth feeling snappy and clean with a strong minty aftertaste that stays with you for a long time (which is reassuring in a crowd!). I would definitely recommend this product to those looking for a strong mint taste and a fresh clean feeling that lasts and lasts.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of the Crest Pro Health Tartar protection rinse from Smiley 360 and I have been using it for almost a week now. I enjoy the taste, very much like spearmint gum as opposed to the heavy alcohol taste you get from many other mouth rinses. I also can tell the difference in the nice bright sparkle of my smile. I find that even the next morning, I don&#x27;t wake up with morning breath and &amp;#34;fuzzy&amp;#34; teeth-they actually still feel good! I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to help keep their teeth clean and healthy!</li>

    <li> I received the Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection rinse free from Smiley360....and just like always..Crest has another winning product.&lt;br /&gt;Very refreshing and not too minty, just enough. Thanks Crest and keep up the good work ! :)</li>
    <li> I received a free Sample from Smiley360. I love the way it makes my teeth feel so clean after using. It gives me fresh breath and helps protect my teeth. It all in all is a great product and i recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used Crest Pro-Health Whitening Toothpaste and Crest Pro-Health Complete Rinse (mouthwash) for some years with the only downside being sloughing of mouth tissues.  Recently I switched the mouthwash to Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection with Fluoride Rinse and soon noticed a loss of taste and metallic taste in my mouth.  I  did not make the connection for a few weeks and continued to use the mouthwash.  About 3 days ago I saw NUMEROUS online reports of the mouthwash causing the same symptoms I have.  I stopped using it, and I am sorry to say the loss of taste and metallic taste have not gone away.  This is very distressing.  DO NOT USE Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection Rinse!</li>
    <li> I got a free sample from smiley 360, great product! I would definitely recommend! My mouth felt so fresh afterwards!</li>
    <li> Great taste Little to no burn like other mouth rinses! Great quality for the price and easily found at local store. I would definitely recommend I got a free sample from Smiley360!</li>
    <li> I received this product for free from Smiley360 for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;I like how this makes my mouth feel and taste. It is easy to use and leaves a fresh taste in my mouth. Just wish it around after you brush your teesth and spit it out. I do it right before bed because you can&#x27;t eat or drink for 30 minutes. I like the child proof cap so I do not have to worry about my kids trying to use this one instead of theirs. The only thing I noticed that I do not like is the face that after I spit it out my toungue kind of has a burny feeling for a few minutes ad I feel like I need to keep spitting for a few minutes</li>
    <li> Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection Rinse is a great rinse that leaves teeth nice and clean in between dentist visits.  The product is alcohol free and does not burn when rising your mouth with this product. It also keeps your breath fresh and fight against cavities as well.  The taste is pleasant but there is a slight after taste that I didn&#x27;t like. Thanks smiley360 I got it free.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little while now,and I am absolutely loving the way it makes my mouth feel! The clean I feel and long lasting freshness of my breath makes me want to use it more and more! Working in conjuction with my whitening toothpaste and toothbrush gives me a confident experience when I talk to people and smile not wondering if my teeth look off color and unattractive. There is nothing like being unsure of yourself when you talk to people, and I definitely feel more confident then usual when I smile now! I got this product for free from Smiley360 to try in exchange for my honest review which is 100% my own! I will definitely be buying more of this product!</li>
    <li> This rinse is a decently good product, better than some, but not my favorite from Crest. I do like how clean it feels, but the taste is not the best. I much prefer their Pro Health Clinical, as I feel it provides a deeper level of clean that I can notice all day. If you just need a regular rinse, this one is great, I just personally prefer a deeper clean.</li>
    <li> I received a full sized product bottle for free from Smiley360 to try for the purpose of a review and I totally loved how gentle it felt on my teeth and mouth.  It had a great taste without being too minty but just minty enough to make my breath feel fresh.  I love that it not only does tartar protection but also contains fluoride for cavity prevention and help strengthen enamel.  I feel good using this product to take care of my dental health and it goes well with the Crest toothpaste I use.  This is one of the best mouthwashes I have used that is so multi-purpose and I love how I often see coupons too which makes this product very affordable.  These opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I gave this mouthwash 5 starts because I love the refreshing taste, and fresh feeling after.  It doesn&#x27;t sting, and my husband loves it just as well!</li>
    <li> I got a full size sample of this from smiley360 and I love it as does my wife. It does not have an overwhelming taste but makes my mouth feel clean and refreshed. I plan on switching to this all the time now. And I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I got this product free from smiley360.com for testing purposes. the taste is great, not too strong like some products can be. I like that I am using a product that helps protect my teeth and prevent cavities</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection Rinse to try from Smiley 360. Before trying this, I was a die-hard Listerine fan. However, I like Crest Pro-Health better because I still get the same fresh clean feeling without as much of the burn. Crest Pro-Health is a slightly milder formula, but it still packs a punch! It doesn&#x27;t taste like watered-down Listerine like I thought it would.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this Crest ProHealth I was sent. It works so well. You can feel it working as you use it and it leaves all surfaces of your teeth clean and smooth. The taste is not too overpowering and it lasts quite a while.</li>
    <li> I love all Crest products, I&#x27;ve been using them since I was a kid and will never stop using them!!</li>
    <li> I love a good rinse after I brush my teeth.  This particular rinse not only helps prevent tartar and cavities, but is also formulated to protect against surface stains and help rebuild enamel. After using the rinse you are left with an invigorating sensation and a fresh feeling mouth.  It&#x27;s the perfect way to end your daily oral hygiene routine and to ensure you meet the day with fresh breath and a brightened smile!</li>
    <li> I got my free bottle to try from smiley360!! I was so surprised how clean and great my mouth felt after use!! Did not burn my mouth!! Love it!! Awesome product!!</li>
    <li> I got this free to try from Smiley360&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this mouthwash - not strong like some&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;use it at night after brushing teeth - before bed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;works great &amp; tastes good too</li>
    <li> I received a full bottle of Crest Pro-Health Tarter Protection Rinse free to try. I am really enjoying this rinse and it is a keeper for me and my family. It has a cool refreshing taste and does not burn. I am definitely glad I was chosen for this mission.</li>
    <li> I love this..it does not burn like others and keeps my mouth clean and my breath fresh. I received a sample of this product from Smiley360</li>
    <li> free sample through Smiley360. was a little iffy at first but this mouthwash is wonderful. clean breath, helps control tarter. Tastes great.tiny bubbles in your mouth. Love it!</li>
    <li> This product is great, I know my next dental check-up is going to be easy to get through. My mouth has never felt fresher and my teeth are whiter and cleaner. One of the best rinses I&#x27;ve ever used in my life.</li>
    <li> Got sample from smiley 360 Crest Pro Health uses stannous flouride, which is a superior dental agent but which was replaced in mass market toothpastes by sodium flouride because the latter had a longer shelf life and lowered manufacturing costs. I enjoy the taste and have had a great experience using the product since it debuted.</li>
    <li> I saw good results after using this mouthwash for several weeks. My dentist even thought I had been flossing regularly like she always tells me to, but I rarely ever do. It does have a slight burn while swishing it, but it was tolerable. This is a mouthwash that I will definitely use for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a sample to test out for free, but all thoughts and opinions in this review are my own.</li>
