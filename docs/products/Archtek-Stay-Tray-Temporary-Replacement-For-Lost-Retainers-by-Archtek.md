      <li>, it was easy to make and works great.  </li>
      <li>Great fit.</li>
      <li>It was barely effective for a day.</li>
      <li>/&gt;We then tried the make your own retainer from sports smiles, that was easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can tell it&#x27;s gonna work perfectly until my new retainer comes in.</li>
      <li>Thought this would be a great quick fix.  </li>
      <li>But but the price it was pretty good and a nice temporary fix.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping (Y) Good product too</li>
      <li>I have 2-3 teeth on each side (top and bottom) not covered.</li>
      <li>Better off getting the 2 for 1 off dentist.net, under $25 after coupon codes.  </li>
      <li>I lost my top invisalign retainer and my teeth already shifted.</li>
      <li>My dog had a love of those.</li>
      <li>The instructions are OK.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;d Be Better Off Just Buying A Mouth Guard</li>
      <li>If I lost my retainers, I would need both the top and bottom, not just one..</li>
      <li>, I think it is an okay temporary replacement for retainers.</li>
      <li>i tried it again (and i wont) make sure you hold the trays horizontally somehow when getting them wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s better than nothing to retain your teeth.</li>
      <li>The Stay Tray really worked great as a temporary retainer.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve been using mine for over a month :-)</li>
      <li>but I should have paid better attention.</li>
      <li>Will purchase again for sure</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m assuming so you can&#x27;t use it for top and bottom..</li>
      <li>: Cheap, Comfortable, Easy Instructions, comes with a nice tray/mirror&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>If there were any lose parts, I would quickly dunk the piece into warm water and tightened the fit manually on my teeth.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about how to clean it though.  </li>
      <li>This retainer (and the kit) is easy to use and does the job well.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>When I got this retainer I saw how easy it was to follow the instructions.</li>
      <li>This temporary retainer was easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I was scared it wouldn&#x27;t turn out fine</li>
      <li>So this should be fine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 month now and will be getting another one as this one is worn out a little bit but still does its job perfectly.</li>
      <li>the best 12 bucks I ever spent!!!</li>
      <li>So I got this instead for a cheap price</li>
      <li>Although it took me forever to fit it to my teeth.</li>
      <li>so far the tray works good, I will update to see if the tray stays and if it is comfortable.    </li>
      <li>Super easy to use.</li>
      <li>This Isn&#x27;t Worth Buying !</li>
      <li>So that way it doesn&#x27;t hold in the position of your shifted teeth but rather their original position.</li>
      <li>the instructions were incredibly easy to follow and the end result is exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>final product (if done right) fits great, and is rather comfortable.  </li>
      <li>It was really easy to mold and worked the first time for me.</li>
      <li>pretty easy to use my doctor</li>
      <li>I like it a lot actually, its awesome and will definitely work!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also pretty comfortable.</li>
      <li>and I thought I would be ok until my new retainer order shipped in but</li>
      <li>At first the retainer was very form fitting to my teeth.</li>
      <li>Pretty good temporary replacement, only comes with one though.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t feel tight after that you can repeat the steps until you get a good fit.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth the risk.</li>
      <li>I was able to get a solid fit because of that.  </li>
      <li>Be careful to not let them touch for more than a second, as you&#x27;ll have a tougher time getting a good fit after that.</li>
      <li>Some improvements Archtek could make:  - Clear tray  - More sizes than one.</li>
      <li>I got 4 months worth out of them(still</li>
      <li>The white plastic is the retainer, and it molded to my teeth pretty nicely.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so important not to go too long without a retainer when you&#x27;ve had dental work done, so finding this cheap, quick replacement when I needed</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s tricky to get it right on the first go.</li>
      <li>Only amazing part is Amazon delivered it very faster</li>
      <li>I think I will try the whole process again to get my top teeth to rest cleanly on the white stuff.</li>
      <li>Excelent and super fast delivery</li>
      <li>/&gt;You place the guard into the hot water vertically</li>
      <li>Only one tray thought I was receiving two one for both top and bottom.  </li>
      <li>I totally recommend it :)</li>
      <li>Perhaps my water was too hot</li>
      <li>When inserting put it on the inside of the back teeth first and insert from the back of your teeth to the front to help prevent it from touching itself, Make sure to use your fingers to help mold the plastic to your teeth  *</li>
      <li>so it softens and then pressing your teeth into it the same as many over the counter nightguards.  </li>
      <li>and I ran to look for this very thing!</li>
      <li>I had to re-do them like 3 times (dunk them in hot water again</li>
      <li>sure when you put them in your mouth to have enough tray in the front, over your teeth.</li>
      <li>When inserting in the hot water, put the Tray horizontal</li>
      <li>I used chopsticks to make sure the white plastic didn&#x27;t fold onto itself.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I followed directions and ended up with a flattened piece of wax that did not feel tight on my teeth so I just threw it away. Waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> Wish the orthodontist gave these to you when ever you got retainers, because everyone who has retainers should look into getting these in case they lose their retainers.</li>
    <li> Description should have been clearer that it was only one retainer, otherwise product was what I expected.  These are not good for day wear but work for nights.</li>
    <li> This thing saved my bottom teeth! My bottom clear retainer got stepped on and was completely destroyed. My orthodontist is only open three days a week and I had to go out of town, so I ordered this (chose 2 day shipping because I was scared my teeth would shift), I followed the easy instructions and it was a perfect fit! Not too tight not too loose. I continued to wear it for 3 weeks. I went to my ortho and he was even amazed, said he&#x27;d &amp;#34;never seen anything like it&amp;#34;, he said I didn&#x27;t even need to buy a new retainer (for $185) because this one works just the same. One con about this is that it is very ugly and noticeable so wearing it out in public isn&#x27;t an option. I used to wear my old retainer out and about and talked to people and nobody noticed, now sometimes I forget I have this one in and I don&#x27;t remember I have it in until I notice people staring at my mouth. But all in all I would absolutely recommend this if you lost/broke your retainer and don&#x27;t have the money for a new one.</li>
    <li> Works great. I wish I would have known about these when I was going through my retainers by the dozen when I was younger. My dog had a love of those. But for a little amount of money you can have a replacement and it is easy to do. I have already told my family and friends about this. Their bracket on the back of their teeth has broken too like mine. Good alternative to going to the othrodontist.</li>
    <li> I purchased as a night guard while an orthodontist manufactured one is constructed. Seems to work fine, just be careful when making the initial mold as boiling water turns the preformed tray into almost liquid. It&#x27;s tricky to get it right on the first go.</li>
    <li> This retainer (and the kit) is easy to use and does the job well. It has lasted me much longer than you&#x27;d expect a \\&quot;temporary\\&quot; retainer to last, but it&#x27;s not a sufficient permanent retainer.</li>
    <li> Being an athlete I would compare this product to your everyday mouth piece. You can go to any store and get this for less than a buck.</li>
    <li> Perfect Fit.&lt;br /&gt;Let me give a few tips along with others.&lt;br /&gt;1.  When inserting in the hot water, put the Tray horizontal so the white won&#x27;t fold.  Tips: Use a stick to press on the inner tray so the white wont fold when both tray are in the water.&lt;br /&gt;2.  The blue and white tray will both melt, so make sure to take it out when the white turns clear (and shrinks a bit).  The blue tray is ment to melt so it can help increase the surface area of the tray.&lt;br /&gt;3.  When you take the tray out of the water, make sure to spread out both end of the trays (blue and white) out so they can fit your back molars.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Insert the tray from back to front.  Then, bite down and suck out any water and air while using your hand to press on the Tray to create a better mold. (Pressing your lips)&lt;br /&gt;Note* This tray works with both upper and lower.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.  Sorry bad grammar, enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;+Recommend.</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting two pieces but I should have paid better attention. Better off getting the 2 for 1 off dentist.net, under $25 after coupon codes.  They slowly wear down month after month making them a little more loose.  I got 4 months worth out of them(still wore them but I wore them every night and my canine/sharp teeth did grind visible holes in them. Definitely not as strong as the grind guards though. After they keep your teeth fairly in place. This is a must for those who lose or lose interesting in wearing their retainers especially in the first few months.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like product, the direction looks very simple but the plastic do not melt like the direction explains. Only amazing part is Amazon delivered it very faster</li>
    <li> I lost my bottom permanent retainer three months after my braces were taken off, and wish I had these on hand. As it was, I didn&#x27;t get this until 2 weeks after first losing my retainer and in that time, my teeth had shifted a little. This won&#x27;t fix it, but I&#x27;m fairly confident that my teeth will be moving less with the Stay Tray. It isn&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;ll probably do the job.    Some improvements Archtek could make:  - Clear tray  - More sizes than one. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2\\&quot;, 120 lbs, and when I slip the Stay Tray on, the excess plastic cuts into my gums. Even so, it doesn&#x27;t reach far back enough to cover my second molars.  - The plastic will melt and the two sides will fuse together if you accidentally let the two sides collapse onto each other while still hot. Be careful to not let them touch for more than a second, as you&#x27;ll have a tougher time getting a good fit after that.</li>
    <li> Too small for adult mouth but didn&#x27;t indicate that in description.</li>
    <li> I received this product in the mail yesterday and followed the directions today- the instructions were incredibly easy to follow and the end result is exactly what I wanted! I would recommend this to everyone who has lost their retainers!</li>
    <li> This was just what I needed for a really good price. It&#x27;s so important not to go too long without a retainer when you&#x27;ve had dental work done, so finding this cheap, quick replacement when I needed it was a godsend.   It was really easy to mold and worked the first time for me. I tried to wear it for too long and found that it got a little loose with time, but it&#x27;s only supposed to be worn temporarily so that&#x27;s to be expected. Good product.</li>
    <li> This is a great substitute for a retainer!  I have been using the same stay tray for the last month and a half so it does last for a decent amount of time.</li>
    <li> I attempted to purchase this item on two separate occasions. The first time I thought I did not use the item properly but after the second purchase, I realized that it is poorly constructed.  It is not meant to replace a clear retainer, which I understood prior to purchasing, but the material itself is ineffective.  It boils as described but it will not hold your teeth in place. It is similar to a night guard in terms of thickness. It will not cover all of your molars and it will not be a tight seal. The material is too thick and if you try to expand it over your teeth as directed, it begins to separate.  Once you try to give it another trial, it is a lost cause. It is better off waiting to see orthodontist and have another retainer made rather than wasting even the little amount of money it will cost to try this Stay Tray.</li>
    <li> Save your mouth, buy this retainer.</li>
    <li> dont even waste ur money</li>
    <li> Excelent and super fast delivery</li>
    <li> Not meant for bottom teeth.  They were so uncomfortable they left blisters in my mouth and i ultimately threw them away</li>
    <li> Stay tray is an excellent product. The directions are easy to follow, takes only a few minutes and it has a comfortable fit. Really the only reason to go back to the dentist is to get a clear retainer. This one is white which is fine with me. I have had it only for a few days so I cannot comment on it&#x27;s durability but I have no reason to believe it won&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> Before I bought this item I read some of the reviews that said the trays were difficult to form after being placed in the boiling water, but I made the foolish mistake of thinking that perhaps I possessed more manual dexterity than those reviewers and thus would not have any problems. WRONG! The tray that comes with the actual retainer mold melts at the same temperature point as the tray, so once that happens you&#x27;re stuck. The two components - which are supposed to separate - basically just form a contorted ball of gel in the water. From that point forward, it&#x27;s useless to try to re-heat and re-mold them.</li>
    <li> Too small to even fit my mouth.  I didn&#x27;t even bother trying to melt it or anything.  Perhaps it&#x27;s a good product for some people.</li>
    <li> You can buy a contact sports mouthpiece and get the same product.</li>
    <li> Pretty good temporary replacement, only comes with one though. Instructions are simple enough to make the mold. Would buy another one</li>
    <li> people are probably wondering why it&#x27;s temporary and it&#x27;s cuz of the material it isn&#x27;t the same as a regular retainer in that regard. works great tho and I&#x27;ve been using mine for over a month :-)</li>
    <li> Worked as expected!  Was pleasantly surprised.  It looks like a white mouth guard but if you do it correctly it&#x27;ll be tight fitting and you can see your teeth molded into it keeping them straight.&lt;br /&gt;  Some tips on getting it to mold correctly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Wait the entire 5 minutes to let it cool, otherwise it&#x27;ll just shrivel up and ruin.  If you let it go to a hard boil wait a little bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;* Swish it around very slowly so it doesn&#x27;t fold onto itself. As soon as it starts to look clear take it out.&lt;br /&gt;* Have a mirror ready, a lot easier to prevent it folding if you can see what you are doing&lt;br /&gt;* When inserting put it on the inside of the back teeth first and insert from the back of your teeth to the front to help prevent it from touching itself&lt;br /&gt; * Once it&#x27;s in suck through it to make a tight seal and continue to do that for 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it doesn&#x27;t feel tight after that you can repeat the steps until you get a good fit.  Hope that helps!</li>
    <li> Only one tray thought I was receiving two one for both top and bottom.  I would not wear during the day but works good for night.  As stated in title they are only meant to be temporary which was proved as I wore through them in only two weeks.  But but the price it was pretty good and a nice temporary fix.</li>
    <li> Really fast shipment and the product is as described it.</li>
    <li> Thank You! You guys are a live saver! I for mine just in time! I was scared it wouldn&#x27;t turn out fine but it did!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Very Disappointed In This Product , I Broke My Retainer About A Week Ago &amp;&amp; I Jus Received My Stay Tray Today ... It Took Me Like 5 Times Just To Moled My Teeth To The Tray &amp;&amp; Shrunk . This Isn&#x27;t Worth Buying ! You&#x27;d Be Better Off Just Buying A Mouth Guard At Your Clinic Store .... Very Disappointed In This Product</li>
    <li> I followed the directions even measuring the temperature of the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the Gotcha,&lt;br /&gt;You place the guard into the hot water vertically the white guard starts to turn clear then it shrinks and sticks to itself or separates from the blue tray and falls out. Ruined, money wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If i tried it again (and i wont) make sure you hold the trays horizontally somehow when getting them wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We then tried the make your own retainer from sports smiles, that was easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.</li>
    <li> It was just very small.  It should be twice that size and longer to cover all your teeth.  It seams as if I is made for small kids but what small children have braces or retainers until after their grown up teeth grow in. The case was awesome but I can&#x27;t use the product so I will hold onto it and use it for something else.</li>
    <li> They work well once you finally get them in the right place. I had to re-do them like 3 times (dunk them in hot water again so I could reshape them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure when you put them in your mouth to have enough tray in the front, over your teeth.</li>
    <li> It looks very strange but it work as described. Just don&#x27;t wear it outside. Use it as temporary use only.</li>
    <li> It is temporary, so don&#x27;t expect anything fancy. Definitely cheaply made, not sure if it&#x27;s even going to work, process of making them is not as easy as you think. When you submerge it into the hot water to shape it, it contracts together and gets smaller, when you try to spread it apart when you take it out and expand it, it&#x27;s hard to do and takes a couple of tries... Mine even tore a little and you can&#x27;t put it back together once it tears. All I can say is, I really hope it works because I&#x27;m really doubtful.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it, it just does not work...</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t very clear in the descriptions that this is only for the upper or lower teeth, not both. If I lost my retainers, I would need both the top and bottom, not just one.. Other than that, I think it is an okay temporary replacement for retainers.</li>
    <li> What a piece of crap. I&#x27;m giving it 1 star because it can&#x27;t give it 0! IF you are trying to keep your teeth straight and are looking for a temporary option know this isn&#x27;t it. The material is too thick and no matter how much you mess with the stupid thing it will never stretch to cover all of your teeth. I have 2-3 teeth on each side (top and bottom) not covered.They actually have a good product on their hands but they include such little product...I&#x27;m assuming so you can&#x27;t use it for top and bottom..thus why they can make you purchase two.. Well, there isn&#x27;t enough for one. What a waste of money! Don&#x27;t buy!!!!</li>
    <li> I like it a lot actually, its awesome and will definitely work! It doesn&#x27;t cover the back two teeth on each side, but this shouldn&#x27;t be a problem while I wait for my real one to come in. My bottom permanent metal retainer just covers the front teeth on bottom, and it isn&#x27;t a problem! So this should be fine. I am going to order a second one just in case I lose my retainer again some day!</li>
    <li> The Stay Tray really worked great as a temporary retainer. Was a little uncomfortable the first night but overall Excellent product to hold you over til your permanent retainer comes in</li>
    <li> I bought this to keep my teeth in place while I waited for a replacement.  The instructions are OK.  They tell you to submerge the entire apparatus into hot water and then place it on your teeth, making sure to keep the tray still while it hardens. Perhaps my water was too hot (I used a thermal laser gun to keep it at the recommend temp), but the blue part of the product warped a lot faster than the white part and ended up become a bit of a mess.  Further, the piece itself did not accommodate my teeth well, so I ended up stretching it until it did.  Needless to say, the white portion did not mold well on the first try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I used a series of warming and adjusting to get the mold on my teeth the way I wanted.  I started out completely softening the white portion separately, as the blue part just wilted too quickly.  After the white part had time to soften up, I quickly rolled it into a thick rope and warmed it again.  Next, I put the rope into the blue tray, and began molding the rope so that more of the material was near the molars.  I allowed it to cool into this shape before removing it and warming it once more - but only just enough to make it malleable again.  Now, I placed it the rope back in and finally put the tray on my teeth, held it down for small amount of time, then let it cool.  After this, I pulled the white part off the blue tray and tested the fit.  If there were any lose parts, I would quickly dunk the piece into warm water and tightened the fit manually on my teeth. Repeated until I had something that was usable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize I probably ruined the whole process during the warming part, but I&#x27;m glad that the white stuff can be remolded. I was able to get a solid fit because of that.  I think I will try the whole process again to get my top teeth to rest cleanly on the white stuff.</li>
    <li> This retainer works better than i expected it to.  My dog chewed up my retainer and I really can&#x27;t afford to go to the orthodontist and pay hundreds for a new one, so decided to try this, it was easy to make and works great.  I won&#x27;t even bother to get a replacement.</li>
    <li> This design does not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is made of a low quality polymer which does not keep your teeth on the right position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would compare to any other sport mouth guard. It is product good idea but it just does not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not spend your money on this product</li>
    <li> Good product. Speedy delivery.</li>
    <li> This thing is great.....but.... you have to follow the directions to the T.  A few added tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 1. Only keep the retainer in the water for 7 or 8 seconds.  Anything longer and you&#x27;ll have a melted ball of plastic that will be very hard to form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Make sure to use your fingers to help mold the plastic to your teeth, and suck hard when you bite down so that all the water will come out, and you&#x27;ll have the tightest fit possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final product (if done right) fits great, and is rather comfortable.  This is literally the same thing they do at the orthodontists office.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why this product would get anything less than 5 stars!! It&#x27;s a life saver and for that price? What&#x27;s there to dislike? I actually bought this temporary retainer 2 years ago as a back up in the event of an emergency...I barely take the time to write a review but I had to because I lost my retainer a few days ago and I thought I would be ok until my new retainer order shipped in but this morning I woke up with a lot of discomfort as I felt my teeth shifting back and I ran to look for this very thing! I&#x27;m wearing it now and so so happy I made this purchase...without a doubt the best 12 bucks I ever spent!!! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Quick shipping (Y) Good product too</li>
    <li> I broke my retainers and while it was sent for repair I was worried about my teeth moving. I was hesitant aboUT this but it was 123 simple to  mold and use. I hope it&#x27;s working but it&#x27;s better than nothing to retain your teeth. Recommend to anyone. Don&#x27;t complain be it&#x27;s just temporary while you wait for your retainers</li>
    <li> Ended up throwing out</li>
    <li> As a temporary replacement, it did the trick. Good for traveling. Easy to use. This is a good product. Ping!</li>
    <li> They really work if you follow directions correctly. I&#x27;m very satisfied with product will recommend. Thank you!</li>
    <li> It might keep your teeth from having major movement but for a temporary replacement it will not keep your teeth from making the minor movements that will end up happening in a short period of time.</li>
    <li> I lost my top invisalign retainer and my teeth already shifted. My dentist told me that I could either pay $300 for a new one or get braces again. Since I don&#x27;t have the money for those options, I decided to use the Stay Tray for now. It took a few tries before I got it right. I put the white plastic in the blue plastic and dunk it horizontally into hot water and waited for a few seconds. I used chopsticks to make sure the white plastic didn&#x27;t fold onto itself. I waited 5 minutes after pouring boiling water as directed, but the white plastic wasn&#x27;t malleable enough. So, after I boiled water, I poured it into a bowl I immediately put the plastics in and took it out after a few seconds. I spread the plastics apart so it could fit my back teeth. I used my fingers to help guide the plastic over my teeth correctly and then sucked in the plastics. I also ran my fingers on the plastics, pushing them onto my them to help them mold. After 3 minutes, I took them out.  The white plastic is the retainer, and it molded to my teeth pretty nicely. It&#x27;s also pretty comfortable. However, I do think there should be more plastic, because it doesn&#x27;t cover the last back teeth. I would like to try to remold it, since the outer and inner half of the retainer isn&#x27;t very even (outer part covers more than enough teeth while inner part covers half); however I am not taking chances of messing up. Time will tell how long these temporary retainers will last.  8/8/15 UPDATE: About Two weeks After Using Stay Tray.  I&#x27;ve been using the stay tray for about two weeks at night. I&#x27;m disappointed at the results.  Usually when I don&#x27;t put in my real Invisalign retainers for a couple of hours, I would feel a tightness when I do put them on since my teeth would shift a little. I have never felt that tightness when I put on the Stay Tray at night, leading me to believe that the Stay Tray doesn&#x27;t correct any shift in teeth.   At first the retainer was very form fitting to my teeth. But now there is this looseness, presumedly  because my teeth shifted and stretched the plastic. Although it is temporary retainer, I expected it to last for a few months at least. The plastic should be a little harder, though I understand it would sacrifice some of the comfort.</li>
    <li> This product was the worst $12 I have ever spent!!! When following the directions precisely, the white tray fell out of the blue tray while I was trying to wave it lightly in the water. When I fished it out, I tried to mend it since it got all mangled and squished together. When I finally got it apart and barely decent, I tried to mold it. It was so lumpy and horrible and missed all my molars! It was also so bulky it made me want to gag. Wish I could get a refund. Don&#x27;t buy this. Just live without the retainers till your orthodontist can make you new ones!!!</li>
    <li> The product as stated is temporary. It has clear directions on how to make it so it fits, and helps aid your teeth stay in place while you get a new one. Again, it is temporary, and not a long term product material.</li>
    <li> This temporary retainer was easy to use.  I wasn&#x27;t sure about how to clean it though.  Afraid that hot water might melt it. It seems to fit loosely, too, so my teeth could be gradually shifting.  But then it&#x27;s not meant for permanent use.  Gives some peace of mind until the permanent one arrives.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I lost my upper retainer in January and my teeth started to shift. I was in panic as a new one costs a lot. When I got this retainer I saw how easy it was to follow the instructions. It really keeps my teeth in places. During the day I don&#x27;t wear it and feel how my teeth shift just a little bit but after a night with the retainer I feel them back to the places. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 month now and will be getting another one as this one is worn out a little bit but still does its job perfectly.</li>
    <li> Worked better than expected. Will purchase again for sure</li>
    <li> If your orthodontist gave you your mold of your teeth you can also use that to make a retainer with this product. So that way it doesn&#x27;t hold in the position of your shifted teeth but rather their original position.</li>
    <li> Key tips:  Always stay on the safe side and go for lower temperature and less time in the water than higher temperature/more time in the water! Remember, if its not hot enough and when you put it in your teeth and take it out it doesn&#x27;t mold, you can always put it in the hot water again. But if it is too hot and the tray folds on itself, you are in trouble.    I microwaved a large bowl of water for 5 mins at 700watts. The water just had lots of tiny bubbles on the bottom and side. I only put the tray in for 3-4 seconds before taking it out and immediately putting it in my mouth.    DON&#x27;T put the tray in vertically (the white part will fold on itself)! Put it in horizontally  When you suck in, suck in hard and continously. Don&#x27;t need to swallow the water/saliva because when u swallow the water/saliva, you&#x27;ll stop sucking it.    at only 25$ for two it&#x27;s worth the risk. Even mouth night guard at my local CVS cost twice as much as that.    Here are the two reviews that helped me:  \\&quot;  * Wait the entire 5 minutes to let it cool, otherwise it&#x27;ll just shrivel up and ruin. If you let it go to a hard boil wait a little bit longer.  * Swish it around very slowly so it doesn&#x27;t fold onto itself. As soon as it starts to look clear take it out. Only keep the retainer in the water for 7 or 8 seconds.  * Have a mirror ready, a lot easier to prevent it folding if you can see what you are doing  * When inserting put it on the inside of the back teeth first and insert from the back of your teeth to the front to help prevent it from touching itself, Make sure to use your fingers to help mold the plastic to your teeth  * Once it&#x27;s in suck through it to make a tight seal and continue to do that for 3 minutes.    Perhaps my water was too hot (I used a thermal laser gun to keep it at the recommend temp), but the blue part of the product warped a lot faster than the white part and ended up become a bit of a mess.    In the end, I used a series of warming and adjusting to get the mold on my teeth the way I wanted. I started out completely softening the white portion separately, as the blue part just wilted too quickly. After the white part had time to soften up, I quickly rolled it into a thick rope and warmed it again.

I allowed it to cool into this shape before removing it and warming it once more - but only just enough to make it malleable again. Now, I placed it the rope back in and finally put the tray on my teeth, held it down for small amount of time, \\&quot;    so far the tray works good, I will update to see if the tray stays and if it is comfortable.    Edit: My retainer shipped out and it fits!, my teeth hasn&#x27;t gone out of shape.</li>
    <li> I knew I was taking a risk buying this online, but I have no other options. I bought two of these, since the reviews were so good. They suck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uncomfortable as all hell and it doesn&#x27;t even fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really disappointed</li>
    <li> The good reviews here led me to purchase the StayTray.  I&#x27;d had orthodontia decades ago, my retainers were long gone, and a recent evaluation by an orthodontist indicated my bite is fine so basically I need to maintain what  I&#x27;ve got.  On top of that, I suspect I clench at night and figured this might be a low cost way to both \\&quot;retain\\&quot; my teeth for awhile and give me clear indication via teeth marks if I need a nightguard.  So that was the plan. I got the retainer, which is personalized by boiling it so it softens and then pressing your teeth into it the same as many over the counter nightguards.  Unfortunately, because you are making the impression through two pieces of plastic (the blue outer one stays in place while creating the impression) it is tricky to truly press the inner white plastic against your teeth.  Even so, I ended up with a very hard plastic retainer that fit firmly against my lower teeth - you can make an impression of either upper or lower - that seemed like it would stay put overnight.  I&#x27;ll never know because the thing felt wretched in my mouth. It felt exactly like what it is, hard plastic, and it cut into my gums. I think I&#x27;d have preferred to stick the softer BLUE piece in my mouth!  Somewhere in the night I gave up  and took it out. I couldn&#x27;t sleep from the discomfort.  It hurt.  One final note to mention.  The points of my teeth almost went through the material when making the impression so that the finished retainer was very thin in spots.</li>
    <li> One of my teeth was turning. It has stopped. Super easy to use. Great fit. Recommend to anyone who uses a retainer.</li>
    <li> The product works as advertised, the only reason I would get rid of my staytray was if I actually went back to ortho and got some clear retainers</li>
    <li> I lost my retainer about 5 months after I got my braces off, and was very nervous about my teeth shifting in the 3-4 weeks that it would take to have a new one made.  This temporary one did a great job of holding me over!  I only wore it at night, but every time I put it in, I could feel that it was a little tight, so I knew that it was pusing my teeth back into place.  After about 2 weeks it started to thin out, so I would only recommend this for short term use.  But it was a life-saver!</li>
    <li> Thought this would be a great quick fix.  Not good for long term.  It was barely effective for a day. The set up of getting it formed to my teeth was not difficult. Easy enough with the instructions it came with.  But after wearing it one night, my teeth altered the tray rather than the tray keeping my teeth straight.  It felt like the tray was not made of strong enough plastic. I bought one for back up. Now I guess I&#x27;ll just use the back up to make a mold of my toes or whatnot</li>
    <li> Helped keep my teeth in place for about a month when I left my retainer in college, but would be better if a bottom retainer was included as well.</li>
    <li> Poor quality, did not work for me.</li>
    <li> It was absolutely perfect! Although it took me forever to fit it to my teeth. But it was good for something temporary. I totally recommend it :)</li>
    <li> My retainers broke and I didn&#x27;t have money or time to replace it. So I got this instead for a cheap price and I didn&#x27;t think it was going to work at first. However it has been at least 3 weeks and my teeth appear to have not moved. I am still going to buy a permanent one but this is perfect when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Cheap, Comfortable, Easy Instructions, comes with a nice tray/mirror&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It will wear out eventually I have worn mine for roughly 3 weeks every night and my retainer has tears in it. I can still wear it and feel a tight fit but it might be too damaged.&lt;br /&gt;You must buy 2 if you want one for both your upper and lower teeth.</li>
    <li> My expensive retainer no longer fit after I got a crown on a front tooth. This little gadget works fine. I am planning on ordering a new one every couple of months until I get a new retainer. Such a great little life saver.</li>
    <li> Bought the stay tray after my dogs chewed up my retainer and wow I could not be happier! Instead of keeping it in the blue tray I submerged the white piece in the water on it&#x27;s own (the blue tray has been known to melt and cause a mess) and I let it turn clear in the water and put it directly on my teeth then placed the blue tray in my mouth over it and bit down and sucked hard and it worked! Very tight fitting just like a retainer. I can tell it&#x27;s gonna work perfectly until my new retainer comes in. Thanks stay tray!</li>
    <li> This has saved my granddaughter&#x27;s teeth until we can get a new retainer.</li>
    <li> pretty easy to use my doctor charged me $800 and  gosh I don&#x27;t even know where did I put them I don&#x27;t mind wearing this all the time .... its white and doesn&#x27;t even show  so far I m liking it !!!</li>
