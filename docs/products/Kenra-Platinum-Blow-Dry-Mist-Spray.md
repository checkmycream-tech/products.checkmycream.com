      <li>I love what it does for my hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair stylist introduced this product to me and fell in love with the results to my hair.</li>
      <li>Such a great product!</li>
      <li>I love the Kenra blow-dry for my hair..</li>
      <li>It works great, and leaves my hair so soft after drying it!</li>
      <li>This is very good if you want to cut your blow dry time.</li>
      <li>I have fine, medium-length hair, and it seems to leave it a bit greasy.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair</li>
      <li>but then again I don&#x27;t have fine hair.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>The product goes on lightly and smells like strawberries.</li>
      <li>This product advertises that it will speed up your drying time, detangle and condition your hair...and it does all of that fabulously.</li>
      <li>It has cut down on my straightening time and greatly protects my hair from getting so many split ends.</li>
      <li>This product is my new favorite!</li>
      <li>This really helps hair dry faster and smells great too!</li>
      <li>I bought this to help speed up dry time when diffusing and it works great for this.</li>
      <li>this bottle came to me leaking and wasn&#x27;t full..</li>
      <li>I have been a triend and true believer for 3 years.</li>
      <li>Overall great product, just wish the price was better for only 3.4 oz bottle.</li>
      <li>Smells great, Nice and light and does cut down on blow dry time to help protect your color.</li>
      <li>My hair looks smooth and shiny even though I really need to color again and my wiry greys are peaking through.</li>
      <li>I love this product - use it every day and leaves my hair soft, manageable and shiny.  </li>
      <li>Super soft, easy to manage and no frizzy leftovers.</li>
      <li>so less is more for fine hair.</li>
      <li>I love this and use it daily.</li>
      <li>My hairstylist told me she uses the Kenra Platinum Thermal Serum usually, but because I already use Healthy Sexy Hair&#x27;s argan oil serum, I was looking for a thermal spray from that line.</li>
      <li>Luckily it does evaporate down with contact from the flat iron and leaves hair with a great shine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll spend $22 locally to make sure I get the real thing.</li>
      <li>It might help a little with frizzes and flyways from blow-drying, but honestly I haven&#x27;t noticed that much of a difference.  </li>
      <li>wants ont</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>I have very curly 3A shoulder length hair.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have to use my curling iron much after blow-drying my hair.</li>
      <li>Very over-priced for the size.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>It really helps my straightener glide though my hair but doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair smelling great and after you flat iron your hair, if you will spray a pump or two in the palm of your hands and rub together then run your hands through your hair, it will leave a little shine and help with frizz</li>
      <li>The first time using the product I worried my hair would appear oily, but instead, my hair, which is cut in a chin-length bob, dried more easily into the style as I used my round brush.</li>
      <li>This is the best stuff for dry brittle, damaged hair or Thick hair that doesn&#x27;t dry fast.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair soft and help with the drying time.  </li>
      <li>and it leaves my hair shinny and soft.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s overall good for thin hair.  </li>
      <li>However, the real reason why this is a holy grail product for me is because of how well it works with a flat iron.</li>
      <li>I really does cut my blow drying time in half and leaves my hair really silky..</li>
      <li>It tends to be dry and frizzy and I have struggled my whole life with split ends from heat styling.</li>
      <li>so I can blow dry my hair straight.</li>
      <li>After using this it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my hair as quickly as the last bottle that I purchased at my local salon.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sister product, the blow dry spray, was a little heavy for my baby fine hair; however, the mist is right on the money.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t actually blow dry my hair too much because with the curls it takes forever.</li>
      <li>One positive is that it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.</li>
      <li>you will appreciate the reduced dry time (what normally takes 20 minutes to dry now takes 15)!  </li>

<li> And it really does cut down the time to dry!</li>
<li> Pump action works only half the time...</li>
<li> I am not sure it does much of anything.</li>
<li> It makes hair soft without making it greasy or weighing it down.</li>
<li> The only drawback is a bit of overspray, and you need to be careful not to inhale the mist, as it can irritate your lungs.</li>
<li> I bought this on the recommendation of a friend--she uses it and loves it for her long, curly hair.  </li>
<li> I can&#x27;t believe I went this long without using it!</li>
<li> I prefer the blow dry spray vs the mist</li>
<li> I like the product, it works well helping the hair dry fast/</li>
<li> For those looking to cut down on dry time, this is a produt you should definitely try.</li>
<li> I would buy the spray next time though because you can use less.</li>
<li> I used it on wet hair just before blow drying</li>
<li> If you try it this way, be warned, your hair will look extremely greasy after you spray it on.</li>
<li> My hairdresser suggested that I purchase this to control the yellowing of my hair due to heat from blowdrying.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
<li> I know some users have said that it was too heavy ...</li>
<li> This is a bit heavy</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s hard to find products that make my hair have a slight shine and not look greasy.</li>
<li> If you have thick hair</li>

    <li> I really like this product. I could only give it 4 stars because the pump didn&#x27;t work ;(</li>
    <li> I have a major head of frizzy hair, and this lessens my dry time by 15-20mins! Smells great too !</li>
    <li> I bought this on the recommendation of a friend--she uses it and loves it for her long, curly hair.  I have fine, medium-length hair, and it seems to leave it a bit greasy.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff for dry brittle, damaged hair or Thick hair that doesn&#x27;t dry fast. The smell is great!!!! I would use it just for the smell. I get compliments all the time when I use this.</li>
    <li> I have very curly 3A shoulder length hair. It tends to be dry and frizzy and I have struggled my whole life with split ends from heat styling. I don&#x27;t actually blow dry my hair too much because with the curls it takes forever. I bought this to help speed up dry time when diffusing and it works great for this. However, the real reason why this is a holy grail product for me is because of how well it works with a flat iron. You just spray this on before you straighten each section of hair. It has cut down on my straightening time and greatly protects my hair from getting so many split ends. If you try it this way, be warned, your hair will look extremely greasy after you spray it on. Luckily it does evaporate down with contact from the flat iron and leaves hair with a great shine. I will be repurchasing when I run out.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product, this was a gift for my daughter, it was one of her wants ont he Christmas list so must be a good product.</li>
    <li> I love this and use it daily. It makes hair soft without making it greasy or weighing it down. A bottle lasts me over a year and I use it each time I wash my hair. I absolutely LOVE the smell of this product.</li>
    <li> I like the product, it works well helping the hair dry fast/safe and smells great (tropical - tanning type smell).  Overall great product, just wish the price was better for only 3.4 oz bottle.</li>
    <li> Very over-priced for the size.</li>
    <li> Kenra Blow-Dry spray works!  If you have thick hair like I do you will appreciate the reduced dry time (what normally takes 20 minutes to dry now takes 15)!  I&#x27;ve also noticed it leaves my hair softer and healthier looking.  I know some users have said that it was too heavy ... I haven&#x27;t noticed it but then again I don&#x27;t have fine hair.</li>
    <li> Love this! My hair is so frizzy and all of the products that I&#x27;ve tried either don&#x27;t work or leave my hair oily. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love the Kenra blow-dry for my hair.. this bottle came to me leaking and wasn&#x27;t full..</li>

    <li> Leaves my hair soft and help with the drying time.  I used it on wet hair just before blow drying and it leaves my hair shinny and soft.  You can use this a finishing spray as well for shine.  This is a bit heavy so less is more for fine hair.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair smelling great and after you flat iron your hair, if you will spray a pump or two in the palm of your hands and rub together then run your hands through your hair, it will leave a little shine and help with frizz</li>

    <li> Such a great product! For those looking to cut down on dry time, this is a produt you should definitely try. I have been a triend and true believer for 3 years.</li>
    <li> Even medium length hair dries in 3 minutes!</li>
    <li> Great product. I prefer the blow dry spray vs the mist but it&#x27;s overall good for thin hair.  I would buy the spray next time though because you can use less.</li>
    <li> This really helps hair dry faster and smells great too! Lasts a while as well.</li>
    <li> I am questioning whether this is actually Kendra or knock off spray. After using this it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my hair as quickly as the last bottle that I purchased at my local salon. It doesn&#x27;t have the same smell either. I won&#x27;t be purchasing again. I&#x27;ll spend $22 locally to make sure I get the real thing.</li>
    <li> Works incredible when drying hair.</li>
    <li> This product advertises that it will speed up your drying time, detangle and condition your hair...and it does all of that fabulously. It&#x27;s sister product, the blow dry spray, was a little heavy for my baby fine hair; however, the mist is right on the money. A must-have if your hair is shoulder length or longer!</li>
    <li> This is very good if you want to cut your blow dry time. Leaves hair smooth and silky.</li>
    <li> Pump action works only half the time...spray is good when I can get the pump to work on the bottle</li>

    <li> This product made my hair manageable shiny and feel like hair again. I love what it does for my hair.  The only drawback is a bit of overspray, and you need to be careful not to inhale the mist, as it can irritate your lungs.</li>
    <li> I love this product - use it every day and leaves my hair soft, manageable and shiny.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Smells great, Nice and light and does cut down on blow dry time to help protect your color. Doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>

    <li> My hairstylist told me she uses the Kenra Platinum Thermal Serum usually, but because I already use Healthy Sexy Hair&#x27;s argan oil serum, I was looking for a thermal spray from that line. This spray says on the back that it is &amp;#34;Keratin-enriched to help strengthen the cuticle and features a blend of Jojoba and Safflower oils. When I spray it on my hair, I see a sheen. The first time using the product I worried my hair would appear oily, but instead, my hair, which is cut in a chin-length bob, dried more easily into the style as I used my round brush. I didn&#x27;t have to use my curling iron much after blow-drying my hair. The product goes on lightly and smells like strawberries. My hair looks smooth and shiny even though I really need to color again and my wiry greys are peaking through.</li>
