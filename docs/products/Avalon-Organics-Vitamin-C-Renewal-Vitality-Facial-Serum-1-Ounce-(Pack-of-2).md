      <li>This topical vitamin C is doing great things for my face.</li>
      <li>In fact, if you care for your skin at all.... dont get this cheaply made \\&quot;organic\\&quot; product.</li>
      <li>It leaves skin looking smooth and radiant.</li>
      <li>Shipped quick and on time and was easy to work with.</li>
      <li>But I always come back to Avalon&#x27;s Vitamin C serum as a great, not-too-heavy, but super moisturizing serum.</li>
      <li>Gives my skin a fresh glow, like I got plenty of sleep and am well hydrated, even if I&#x27;m not!</li>
      <li>There is also a fragrance now that had not been in original formula.  </li>

      <li>Works better with the whole set the Cleanser and the Cream, your skin will thank you.</li>
      <li>you can get this at the \\&quot;whole food\\&quot; stores, at almost twice the price :).</li>
      <li>Light fresh and fragrance of orange.  </li>
      <li>but I love using it so much.</li>
      <li>preservatives\\&quot; This may not be a true Avalon Organics product.</li>
      <li>Somehow they want me to believe that their new 100% plastic container is better than the original glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t even need a moisturizer for the first time ever!</li>
      <li>: I liked the product well enough.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I&#x27;m going to try something else next.</li>
      <li>It is a powerful antioxidant that defends against the damaging effects of free-radicals.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this vitamin c serum for brightening and protecting from free radicals .</li>
      <li>face feels nice and soft &amp; also with the new formula, I feel a tightening of the skin, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>After reading about all of the amazing benefits of Vitamin C for my skin, I bought the Avalon Organics facial serum, trusting in its claim to be all natural and safe for sensitive skin.  </li>

      <li>First of all, DON&#x27;T over-use.</li>
      <li>Great on dark spots &amp; softens skin like no other.</li>
      <li>The orange smell isn&#x27;t as strong and I have to use 2-3 times the amount to cover the same areas and it doesn&#x27;t brighten my skin.</li>
      <li>I cannot really rate it, I just got it a few weeks ago, shipping was very fast, the pump is really handy, no need to squeeze a tube ....</li>
      <li>I used to love the cream, then I ordered it in the last two months and it came with new label and packaging.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it for people who are used to this kind of active ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>Great product, same thing that I get from Whole Foods, but for half the price.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and this product helps \\&quot;calm down\\&quot; a tendancy for redness on my face.  </li>
      <li>Product is as advertised and reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>It really did help keep my skin</li>
      <li>I feel like I went through the bottle way too fast.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had high hopes for this vitamin c serum for brightening and protecting from free radicals . However, I was disappointed by how much this made my skin burn and turn bright red. I wasted my money on this and while $30 doesn&#x27;t seem like much it is a lot to spend on a worthless product.</li>
    <li> I have really tricky, sensitive,  breakout prone skin, yet I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s &amp; it needs some moisture too!  I have La Mer creme for spot treatment of dry patches and I&#x27;ve used the serums with decent results. But I always come back to Avalon&#x27;s Vitamin C serum as a great, not-too-heavy, but super moisturizing serum. Love it in winter and can use it year round. Helps my skin look conditioned, glowing &amp; Young!  Good stuff</li>
    <li> First of all, DON&#x27;T over-use. I would advise it be used a.m. OR p.m. before bed. I can&#x27;t recall the product instructions, so forgive my stating the obvious. PROS: along with your favorite products, use this to reduce pimples. It smells like orange juice, seems sticky at first, but is compatible with other skin-clearing products. I usually apply this first. SEMI-CON: I was using this product a.m. and p.m. It really did help keep my skin clear-er with the use of salicylic acid plus a 2.5% benzoyl peroxide lotion--plus sunscreen and Cerave&#x27; lotion. Then I developed rosacea recently (I have Celiac Disease, an auto-immune disorder which makes me vulnerable to other AI disorders). I developed a rash (tiny pimples, in about a 2-inch circle on my left cheek). The Vitamin C serum and everything else did not clear this breakout like they had cleared \\&quot;normal\\&quot; pimples before (which led to my suspicion that I had rosacea, and which my derm doc has verified). I am now using Azelex, Retin-A and a sulphur cream (just on spots) prescription, per his instructions (cleansing with Cerave&#x27; cleanser, and topping with Cerave&#x27; lotion + Olay sensitive skin lotion w/ SPF15). I will add the Vit. C again soon, to see what happens. ONE MORE THING; I am 58, and my daughter is 20. This serum has kept her more oily skin much more clear than ever. She uses it with a medium-strength benzoyl peroxide solution after cleansing with Cetaphil.</li>
    <li> I used to spend an ungodly amount of money on vitamin C Serums. This product is as good as any of the higher priced ones. I highly recommend it for people who are used to this kind of active ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;Also you can get this at the \\&quot;whole food\\&quot; stores, at almost twice the price :).</li>
    <li> I used to love the cream, then I ordered it in the last two months and it came with new label and packaging. The new version burns my skin - had to send back. Watch out, if you get the cream now, you get the new version which is not the same as the old one!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist said I had to use this product or something similar for my delicate fair skin.  Used to buy it at the health food grocery store -&lt;br /&gt;yikes - the price was high.  Not to mention the nearly 9% sales tax.  I bought a couple of sets of these and with the shipping, it was still a terrific savings.  I have to use it every other night and apply daily so I&#x27;ll keep purchasing it from amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I really like Avalon Organics Vitamin C line!  They all smell fantastic!! This serum is so soft and silky.  I use it under their day creme everyday. I have sensitive skin and this product helps \\&quot;calm down\\&quot; a tendancy for redness on my face.  Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Light fresh and fragrance of orange.  Keeps skin looking firm and clear.  Tingles when you put it on.  I found it to be effective and good quality.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and have loved it. It seems as if formulation as changed. Texture is creamy and not like a serum. There is also a fragrance now that had not been in original formula.  A few words to the company,..you had a good product along with many followers. Don&#x27;t screw this up!</li>
    <li> Would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> This serum did absolutely nothing for my normal/combo skin. It was sticky but I stuck with it because I thought maybe it&#x27;ll work in a few weeks. Nope.</li>
    <li> I think this is a good product for the price. I wish the concentration of vitamin C was disclosed, so the consumer can compare to other similar products.&lt;br /&gt;The base is fluid and lightweight, suitable for combination skin care use. Orange peel oil might be an irritant for the skin though. But it sure smells nice.</li>
    <li> Although I was hesitant to purchase this due to all the reviews saying the formula has changed, mine arrived with the old packaging and label and I don&#x27;t notice a difference from the product that I purchased at my local pharmacy. I love this serum and have noticed a big difference in my skin since using it. I also love the price point difference.....almost 2 for the price of one here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This serum created acne on my face!&lt;br /&gt;Totally disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great on dark spots &amp; softens skin like no other. Use together with DMAE facial Serum morning &amp; night for best results.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product. Gives my skin a fresh glow, like I got plenty of sleep and am well hydrated, even if I&#x27;m not! Plus it has clean and simple ingredients and is not tested on animals. I put it on every night before bed after washing my face. Also smells like fresh oranges, very pleasant.</li>
    <li> I started using &amp;#34;Avalon Organics Vitamin C Renewal Vitality Facial Serum&amp;#34; shortly after another similar product, &amp;#34;Clearly-C&amp;#34;, distributed by AVON, was no longer available. I realized how important Vitamin C was to protect exposed facial skin, so I mixed the Vitamin C serum with moisturizer just before applying it. My recommendation is to try using &amp;#34;Avalon Organics Vitamin C Renewal Vitality Facial Serum&amp;#34;. You&#x27;ll be amazed how wrinkles become less noticeable.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. This topical vitamin C is doing great things for my face. Less visible lines and diminishing skin tags.</li>
    <li> I have been ordering this product from this buyer for at least 18 months now and it&#x27;s the cheapest I can find for a 2 pack even though the price keeps going up, like everything else I guess.</li>
    <li> As always I love this product.  I have recommended it to many of m y friends.  I will order more.</li>
    <li> After trying the Vitamin C Moisture Plus Lotion with SPF 15, I noticed that Vitamin C creams showed amazing results. My skin was tighter, firmer and looked more toned. In fact, I felt that my skin looked younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is perhaps one of the best anti-aging secrets around. At least when you apply vitamins topically, you can see fast results. This topical serum will improve your skin circulation, clarity, tone and even the texture. It will stimulate the production of collagen and elastin, especially when applied with an extra helping of aloe vera gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a highly concentrated formula. You will be tempted to use this all over your body. I put a bit of this serum with all my skin lotions for an all-over body treat. You can apply this before your face moisturizer or mix it in with your body creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This specific Vitality Serum has Activated vitamin C (Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate). This is a stabilized form of Vitamin C. It is a powerful antioxidant that defends against the damaging effects of free-radicals. Once you read about free-radicals in Stephen Cherniske&#x27;s book: The Metabolic Plan, you understand the war you are in and your body needs assistance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not tested on animals and has 100% vegetarian ingredients! It will protect your skin from the signs of aging, stimulate cell renewal and make your skin look radiant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;70% Certified Organic Ingredients including: Botanical Infusion of Green Tea, Papaya and Cucumber, Aloe Vera, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (vitamin C), Vegetable Squalane, Tocopheryl Acetate (vitamin E), Panthenol (pro-vitamin B5), Rose Hips Extract, Borage Oil, Evening Primrose Oil, Allantoin, Cocoa Butter, Retinyl Palmitate (vitamin A), Ergocalciferol (vitamin D), Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Rose Essence, Xanthan Gum, Vegetable Glycerine, Sodium Citrate, Methyl/Propylparaben, Orange Oil, Beta Carotene&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also noticed that the \\&quot;orange oil\\&quot; makes me feel happy. I think it lifts your mood a bit each time you use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has a wonderful scent. I&#x27;ve also used Source Naturals Skin Eternal Serum which has a more lemon scent and is also highly recommended. Skin Eternal Serum also have Vitamin C, but has added products like alpha-lipoic Acid, Lavender oil and Chamomile Flower Extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend alternating these two products for added benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also look for the Avalon Active Organics products containing their wonderful Lavender extracts. The Lavender products are scented like a lavender field and are the most pleasant lavender products I&#x27;ve found to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Reviewts your mood a bit each time you use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has a wonderful scent.

Skin Eternal Serum also have Vitamin C, but has added products like alpha-lipoic Acid, Lavender oil and Chamomile Flower Extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend alternating these two products for added benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also look for the Avalon Active Organics products containing their wonderful Lavender extracts. The Lavender products are scented like a lavender field and are the most pleasant lavender products I&#x27;ve found to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> I have bought this serum many times, incredible skin results!&lt;br /&gt;I have even tried a section of other similar products, this is by far the best.&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy another.&lt;br /&gt;Trust me.</li>
    <li> After reading about all of the amazing benefits of Vitamin C for my skin, I bought the Avalon Organics facial serum, trusting in its claim to be all natural and safe for sensitive skin.  I applied it all over my face and it instantly burned, painfully, and caused my entire face to become very hot and turn beet red.  Could not wash it off fast enough!  I have never had this type of reaction to any skin creams before and trust me, I have used every major brand out there.  Needless to say, am returning it!</li>
    <li> Avalon Organics products are not supposed to have any parabens in them. If you read the ingridients listed on avalonorganics.com, you will notice that products are advertised as \\&quot;No parabens or other harsh preservatives\\&quot; This may not be a true Avalon Organics product. I compared the ingridients list and it is not matching.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin silky smooth and clear. I would recommend this to everyone who wants their skin to feel refreshed and clear!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Not greasy. Not heavy.</li>
    <li> Great product, same thing that I get from Whole Foods, but for half the price. It leaves skin looking smooth and radiant. Has no greasy residue like a lotion has - almost provides a matte type finish.</li>
    <li> I received the item ordered but i am not sure if this item is what i ordered for.  First, the lable on the bottle  is different from what i have been using and it has different scent, too.  Also, the image i saw when i ordered and what i have received is different.  I ordered same item from private seller and they just cancelled it without any notice.  That&#x27;s why i reordered this item with \\&quot;sold and ship by amazon\\&quot;.  If there were any changes made by avalon organics, shouldnt amazon have duty to inform to customers?</li>
    <li> This is really good. I like the way it absorbs in my skin. It does help with with acne scarring.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Vit. C serum for about four years and it&#x27;s part of my daily routine.  I&#x27;m 77 so didn&#x27;t expect miracles when I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face feels nice and soft &amp; also with the new formula, I feel a tightening of the skin, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered two 1 ounce bottles of the Vitamin C serum and thought it was a good buy!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product.  I tend to go for the buz words in products and was looking for a vitamin c serum.  I cant tell you if it does the trick for sure but I love using it so much.</li>
    <li> I bought this serum last year and it did wonders for my skin within just a week. I loved using it, because it wasn&#x27;t too thick and could double as a facial toner and lotion for my forehead. It had a great, strong orange smell. It brightened my skin within just a few days of using it and lessened break-outs on my forehead. Best of all, the smallest bit, went a long way. However, this latest batch that I&#x27;ve received is not nearly as good. It&#x27;s now, more like lotion than a serum. Thankfully, not too thick for my forehead, so the purchase isn&#x27;t a complete waste. The orange smell isn&#x27;t as strong and I have to use 2-3 times the amount to cover the same areas and it doesn&#x27;t brighten my skin. The old formula was 5 stars. I won&#x27;t be ordering this again if the formula stays as it is. I&#x27;m so disappointed. I finally found something that was perfect for my skin, now I have to start searching all over again.</li>
    <li> Feels good on my face and my skins looks great; nourishes and replenishes. Shipped quick and on time and was easy to work with.</li>
    <li> Pump jams on container. Will squirt product a foot away. Was looking for a cheaper alternative to Obagi RX C clarifying serum. This was not it.</li>
    <li> I use this mixed with some argan oil, rosehip and jojoba oil. So far had great results, waited a bit to post a review so that I can confirm if I see any results.</li>
    <li> After working in a spa and experiencing many products, my wife feels this cream is excellent for the price.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I cannot really rate it, I just got it a few weeks ago, shipping was very fast, the pump is really handy, no need to squeeze a tube ....</li>
    <li> Product is as advertised and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> First time user, very happy with the results.  I have already recommended to others and purchase my third bottle.  Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> My first bottle was great!  However, on this second one I ordered the formula has changed and I detest the smell! Will not buy again unless the go back to old formula.</li>
    <li> This product has taken 5 years off my face at least and if I were to brag, more. My skin is soft and you ge reeling as well. I call it a facelift in a bottle. I am truly amazed!</li>
    <li> She has tried many products, and has decided that this one is the best.  I believe her and you should to.  Calling my wife a liar?  That&#x27;s not cool man.  She&#x27;s a wonderful, honest lady with great skin.</li>
    <li> Feels Good, Smells Good. Works better with the whole set the Cleanser and the Cream, your skin will thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product (Vit C Serum) for years..and LOVED it, RELIED on it, and ALWAYS received great results. Five stars without a doubt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER - - -&lt;br /&gt;This new formula...how do we say......SUCKS.&lt;br /&gt;It is cheaper in quality, does NOT improve/fade the appearance of dark marks/acne spots, and does not lighten/balance uneven skin tone. The original product used to do all of this within one week!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read additional reviews of Avalon Organic&#x27;s new formulas of a few of their other products like the Q10 Night Cream, and those consumers also claimed that the new formula of that product is not as good. Uhhh! MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C&#x27;mon, Avalon Organics! IF IT AIN&#x27;T BROKE, DON&#x27;T FIX IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please change back to the old formula!!!!!! PLEASE Please Pretty Pleeeease!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks..Please :)</li>
    <li> I so wish I had discovered this product 20 years ago! I was one of those teens that everyone hated. Perfect complexion always. Then menopause 20 years ago destroyed my skin! I had an easy menopause, no bad symptoms, except for my skin! I tried everything! Skin products, acne products, different makeup, vitamins, if there was a possible solution I tried it. Then I found this. I&#x27;ve only been using it a short time, but my face has completely cleared. I swear my lines are softening, and flexibility returning. I am using my regular soap, and regular makeup, only difference is this and the astringent. (Avalon Organics Vitamin C Renewal Balancing Toner) also available on Amazon. I don&#x27;t even need a moisturizer for the first time ever! I hope to never run out of this product! You need to wait a short time before putting on your makeup as it needs to dry, but it is so worth it, at least for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum twice a day for 2 or 3 weeks. I haven&#x27;t noticed major differences with hyperpigmentation yet, but I&#x27;ve liked it so far. I&#x27;m 39 with combination skin. Most of my life I struggled with oily skin and acne. I&#x27;m an active outdoors person with fair skin, and have gotten a fair bit of sun damage unfortunately. Now that I&#x27;m 39 my skin is less oily, I break out less, and wrinkles and sun damage are bigger concerns. I still have blackheads in my T zone and occasional breakouts, so I&#x27;m still concerned about products making me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the texture of this serum. It&#x27;s lightweight and absorbs completely. I like the pleasant, citrusy scent. No breakouts or other adverse reactions. So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said I need to give it more time to tell on the sun damage, but this is my report so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April 19 update: I liked the product well enough. The pump is hard to control, though, and it dispenses too much. I feel like I went through the bottle way too fast. I know it usually takes about 6 weeks for a product to show results. I didn&#x27;t get enough time with it to really tell. Honestly, I&#x27;m going to try something else next. Maybe I&#x27;ll try this again in the future. I did like the texture, smell, moisturizing quality, and the fact that I didn&#x27;t break out. I wish I could have tried the old formula that everyone raved about so much.</li>
    <li> To start off.. the ingredients do not add up to what the product is supposed to do. Vitamin C doesnt come from oils off plants. Also, there are other ingredients that are BAD for your skin when exposed to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Now when i tried this product on my skin..&lt;br /&gt;I experienced a HORRIBLE flush in my face. It was awful. I gave it THREE more tries and the second time my facial irritation wasnt as bad, but the third and fourth time just got worse. I will be returning this product.&lt;br /&gt;It has fragrance, when it shouldnt, and if you have sensitive skin THIS PRODUCT IS NOT FOR YOU. In fact, if you care for your skin at all.... dont get this cheaply made \\&quot;organic\\&quot; product. (Just because organic is in the NAME doesnt mean its actually organic.) Waste of money</li>
    <li> They did not send the serum, they sent eye cream and the tube in the botte was bent, of course I did not find this out until it was open and it is too much trouble to send back and there is no way I can email the sellers, so I am stuck.  be careful&lt;br /&gt;Cathy</li>
    <li> Been using this product for several years but this time received containers that were labeled \\&quot;New, Improved bottle.\\&quot; Somehow they want me to believe that their new 100% plastic container is better than the original glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come on Hain Celestial, it&#x27;s just cheaper. This plastic isn&#x27;t even not numbered so it&#x27;s not recyclable. Should have increased the price a bit to pay for glass bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll find another product.</li>
    <li> I liked this treatment...but found that using it too frequently really wasn&#x27;t good for my sensitive skin.  So...I use it occasionally now.</li>
    <li> Not oily very smooth.</li>
