<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product. Tingles, exfoliates, leaves skin feeling flawless and smooth.</li>
    <li> This mask is wonderful.  I don&#x27;t mind the smell, I don&#x27;t even notice it.  It has improved my pores, and that is a really big deal for me.  I leave it on for 20 minutes.</li>
    <li> The jar was not in its original packaging which is how it should be received when classified as &#x27;new&#x27;.  The jar also had scratches on it.  Bottom line, it appeared used.  I promptly returned it.</li>
    <li> I read alot of the reviews before I bought this. I tend to get carried away with hyped beauty products. I didn&#x27;t mind the smell(very strong green tea) as some reported and the consistency was good (some said the tea leaves annoyed them). I liked the scrubby bit to this mask, It goes on for 10 mins to a dry face and then you rinse. My skin looked healthy and slightly pink, but that went away pretty quickly. My guess is if you&#x27;re going out at night for something special, do this mask beforehand. It is expensive and though it looked bigger, the actual mask product is inlayed and it&#x27;s a small amount. Probably won&#x27;t buy it again, it was nothing mindblowing...</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! it&#x27;s my go to product if I have an event. like a mini facial in a jar!</li>
    <li> it is the worst mud must i ever use. it becomes very dry in 3 mins so I have to use mist spay 3 times to keep it wet when i doing the mask. What&#x27;s more, the mask is very rough, so i have to wash it carefully or i will hurt myself. The price of the mask is much higher than it quality.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff - you see and feel a difference.</li>
    <li> Burns a bit during first application but after exfoliating and rinsing my skin looked younger and smoother, an effect that lasted for days!</li>
    <li> a very small pack as a mask,it says only need to put a thin layer on every time.&lt;br /&gt;smells like grass.&lt;br /&gt;a little bit pain if skin&#x27;s in very dry condition.&lt;br /&gt;i thinks it mainly  a polishing and deep cleaning.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews about burning but to me it wad just a good tingling.  I really like how my skin looked after and how good moisturizer felt over it. I totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> The only reason this item loses a star is due to cost.  Otherwise, it is a fantastic cleanser.  I use it every 5 days on the regular, and immediately notice a reduction in blemishes.  It burns a bit putting on, but smells fantastic, and feels tingly and wonderful when smoothing off.  Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product !.... My skin looks noticeably great, after every time I use it. Looking brighter, and the skin feels smoother. It does actually work !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I have a combination skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing its expensive, but buying through amazon is cheaper.</li>
    <li> Love this product so much. I will always repurchase.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this product at Sephora used it a few times and loved it, but it was too pricey so I was excited when I saw it for a lot less on Amazon. However, the results with the one I got on Amazon were very different. I broke out in tiny little pimples only in the places I used the mask. I was so disappointed because when I used the sample from Sephora I loved it.</li>
    <li> Does not really work for dry skin</li>
    <li> The formulation seems a bit unrefined.  Large particles that are in all different sizes that scrub and potentially scratch the skin and then there is an assortment of green tea leaves in the formula as well.  The green tea leaves appear like chopped parsley that was added at the end of the recipe.  Not sure what the benefit or how the benefit of these leaves are delivered into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea is good, the formulation needs refinement.</li>
    <li> Product looks good&lt;br /&gt;Really will feel some tightening of the face&lt;br /&gt;The moment has no effect, and perhaps to see results after would recommend to a friend</li>
    <li> Not bad, but if use more than once a week, may cause the dark spot worse</li>
    <li> Not realloy impressed with this product.  It smells awful.</li>
    <li> Expensive but it does what it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;I use it 3 times a week and my face is softer, smoother and clearer.&lt;br /&gt;I suffered from terrible teen acne and now older, I get deep, large white heads.&lt;br /&gt;This mask clears the oils and I am not getting as many white heads.&lt;br /&gt;My acne scars are softer and my pores are less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;Very expensive, but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use 3 times weekly.</li>
    <li> I first got the Youthmud mask in the smaller size as I wasn&#x27;t willing to shed that much money on the full size if I didn&#x27;t fall in love with it. I actually have reviewed the small size, but that was after just using it a few times, so this is more of a now that I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year review. This mask is still amazing. I have dry skin and it really shows when I wear makeup, especially between my eyebrows (weird place I know.) I always apply this a night before gong out to an event to remove all the dry skin. My skin always feels super smooth, and the day of an event I use a moisturizing leave on mask (like Glamglow thirsty mud, where you apply and no not need to remove as your skin will absorb. I really like that type of combination, Not always using thirstymud. Exfoliating things always require some sort of moisture after to ensure your skin stays smooth and not dry, so remember that when using this product. I usually use emu or argon or maracuja oil. This is a great mask if you know the right steps to use it. I don&#x27;t think this will be as effective for those with oily skin. Hope this review helps!</li>
    <li> got this for friends and this is not the first time i came back for this so i guess it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff! Finally a product that works! Use 3 x a week to erase wrinkles , sun spots and large pores! Yay</li>
    <li> I had to put a lot of thought into this purchase because of the price. I researched it and decided to try it. Im so glad that I did!!! I rotate it with my much cheaper, white clay mask and a little goes a long way so it will last for a while. What sets it apart is the glow. My regular mud mask cleans my face but I have never &#x27;glowed&#x27; afterward. You know those times when you want to look your best and feel good about yourself? Well this is one of those products that do just that. I just put it on clean, dry skin normally but here is how I use it for &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; times: I cleanse and exfoliate. Then I steam my face to open the pores (old school style with boiled water) then apply a light layer with a little more on my cheeks and nose. I rinse after 15 minutes and apply Thirsty Mud (another well thought out purchase because of price). My skin after this is unreal! My dry, thin, 45 year old skin is clean, plump and glowing! I hope that continued treatments will mean more permanent results.</li>
    <li> Product works great, but I deducted two stars because of all the hardened pieces throughout the mask that are unusable In an already very small jar for a very high price, I would not expect to find dried out chunky pieces of the mask throughout the treatment that make it hard to apply the mask neatly and then they fall off in large pieces all over the place. Very messy. Are all the masks like this one or did I just get a dud?</li>
    <li> I feel like this is OK. Feels nice and it did make my skin soft, but I think less expensive products would work just as well.</li>
    <li> It is such a good think to fix my skin problem. I would recommend u guys to buy it .</li>
    <li> Only used twice. My face looked fresh afterwards.</li>
    <li> This mask works great! My skin just glows like nothing else after using this. However, it is extremely tingly and does hurt pretty bad if it makes its way into your eye. The Amazon price is great. I would not pay full price for this product and would invest in a Clarisonic instead. If you do have a Clarisonic, this is a great addition to your skin care routine.</li>
    <li> Summer months are rough for me, my skin breaks out like crazy and my pores are always very clogged, even with a normal skincare routine in the morning and at night. I hate to use the term &amp;#34;miracle cream&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s what this is for me! I had a lot of small whitehead breakouts on my face and using this the first time cleared it up! I used it at night, washed it off, went to bed and the next morning my skin was more evenly toned, it was brighter and no more breakouts! It is a little pricey so I am going to try to use it only every other week unless I feel I need it more but the Amazon price is fantastic compared to anywhere else. I have very sensitive skin and it did burn rather than tingle but it was no where near unmanageable. It felt like the same kind of burn from a product like  Noxema. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> GlamGlow is great.  It extracts all the toxins from your face.  It leaves a tingling, clean, glow on your face.</li>
    <li> Me and my girlfriend loved it. She nows wants us to use it 3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;Very good item</li>
    <li> Despite any and all negative reviews I read about this product, I bought it. And I have to say it has worked miracles for me. I was not disappointed in the least. After just three days of using it, my skin felt softer, my makeup went on smoother, and there was a definite visible difference. Yes it comes in a tiny bottle despite the price, but you really don&#x27;t need to use a lot with each use. I didn&#x27;t find the pumice exfoliate too harsh on my pores, in fact I thought it was refreshing. And the burning sensation you feel when you first apply the mask doesn&#x27;t last long. In fact, after several uses, it ceased to \\&quot;burn\\&quot; at all for me. All in all, five stars.</li>
    <li> This product is worth the money! On first use, my skin looked like I had botox (wrinkles smoothed!) and/or a great skin peel. I apply it with a makeup brush, feel it get tight like cement drying and let it dry 10 to 15 minutes, rinse then poof! Tightened and lifted. Refined pores, evened skin color and imperfections and no more bumps. Over 2-3 weeks, using once or twice a week, my skin looks clearer, more refined, not dry or flaky, only need a little bit of foundation or powder for a flawless look. My skin even looks good without make up. Most important of all, others notice the improvement in my well over 50 year old skin!</li>
    <li> I knew about the product by Anstgram and by the net is amazing on my skin&lt;br /&gt;I loved it so much .</li>
    <li> Love the product.  It is the exact one as at Sephora.  I love the tingling sensation, then the tightness, then the hardening effect of the mask.  It works well if you scrub the skin with it first, let dry (it will start tingling),then harden.</li>
    <li> This burns my face- if you have sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I am 60 years old.....ouch I admitted it!  But that being said , I have tried so many products to look younger, its ridiculous.  But this product stopped me dead in my tracks....its amazing.  I could not believe my face looked so good, and the next morning looked even better!  I will never be without this product again.  Yes the tea leaves are annoying, but thats a small price to pay for gorgeous skin.</li>
    <li> This is more than I would normally spend for a face product but it is worth every penny. I can&#x27;t tell you you the last time my face felt so smooth. My skin is sensitive so I only use it twice a week rather than every other day as recommended .</li>
    <li> I tried this facial mask due to the media I&#x27;ve heard about it. I gave it a try and it&#x27;s just ok to me. I do my own at home glycolic and salcyic acid peels and follow with a moisturzing peel. I also use Lancer Rx polish daily which is a God send for my oily skin. This was a good try, but not the best exfoliator for me.</li>
    <li> Love this,I used it wkly and now only need to use 1-2 times a mo.</li>
    <li> Amazing! You can feel it working within seconds of applying it. Leave your skin smooth and soft. Visibly minimized my pores.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin feel amazing. You can see your skin clearing up while it is on! Definitely worth using. Now use it once a week. My skin has never looked better.</li>
    <li> a great product, somewhat replaces the need to have facials, makes your face feel AMAZING. a must for any girl/guy looking to have great skin!</li>
    <li> Love this product! A great exfoliant/mask, as a paramedical esthetician I really enjoy this product. Deep cleansing, deep exfoliation. Follow up with a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I expected..</li>
    <li> This product is literally life changing!! Love them all!</li>
    <li> This stuff is expensive, in my opinion but it takes just a dab.  I leave it on for at least 15-20 min., rinse and tah dah, my face feels so soft and I&#x27;m 63 yrs old so feeling soft has been just a fond memory.  recommend highly.</li>
    <li> I like this product but it dries up hard very easy.  And this item was not cheap. I would like a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;I would like you to replace this item. It cost to much to dry up n the jar with the lu d tightly&lt;br /&gt;Closed&lt;br /&gt;I would like a replacement or a refund on my account this product dried up&lt;br /&gt;And could not b used&lt;br /&gt;Please respond to me</li>
    <li> pores were smaller right after i washed my face off &amp; skin was smoother!  i have sensitive skin &amp; absolutely LOVED this product!!!!  would highly definitely recommend to a friend.  i now do the facemask once per week on my face &amp; notice results immediately after rinsing the product off my face.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Makes your face feel very clean &amp; smooth!  Dries quickly.  Good price for a great product!  Worth the price</li>
    <li> not so great. this product makes it seem like its going to work magic but it doesnt. there is very little product in this container so expect it to last maybe a few weeks at best..</li>
    <li> They sent me the pink one instead. They told me it&#x27;s the same, but it is not&lt;br /&gt;I contacted them and they asked me to return it, but it will cost me more money</li>
    <li> I love this when it&#x27;s new. I put the lid on tight and it still dries out. It&#x27;s so hard even with boiling water it doesn&#x27;t smooth out. Any ideas?</li>
    <li> This dried my sensitive skin out way more than I wanted, but it did do a great job exfoliating and getting rid of black heads. I would use again if given to me but I wouldn&#x27;t eve buy it again. The tiny jar dries out away too fast. Also, I hated the million large pieces of leaves in it. Gross and I think they are at just a filler in the bottle.</li>
    <li> GlamGlow really pushes that it&#x27;s a staple amongst celebrities, since celebrities MUST be beauty geniuses to look that good on a magazine cover (Photoshop, wha? Makeup artist, who?). The jar, shiny and black in all its glory reminds me of those tinted SUVs with their shiny, spinning hubcaps cruising Sunset Blvd on a Friday night. If you love yourself some Hollywoodland, then packaging alone could fake bake your mind into thinking you&#x27;ll achieve Katy Perrydom after using this mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When reality sets in, this is what will happen:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. As you apply it to your face, you&#x27;ll notice it doesn&#x27;t spread easily because there are chunks of tea leaves in it. Yes, that&#x27;s weird to have pieces of leaves stuck to your face, but so is plastering your face in green mud. You get over it. The smell is potently fragrant. This too, you will get over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. As the mask dries on your skin, it will feel like a green cement casing that gradually turns whiter as it dries. Fielding calls is a problem, texting is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. When it&#x27;s time to rinse, the mask will fall off in pieces and residually feel grainy. Graininess&#x3D;exfoilation for your sad, dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. You&#x27;ll emerge with an au natural glow ala Carey Mulligan, if you really need a celebrity comparison. Yes, pores look nearly invisible. Yes, your skin will feel refreshed and soft. No, it won&#x27;t last for more than a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result is the way you wish your skin would greet you every morning if you lived somewhere with perfect air and weather conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE main con: Despite it&#x27;s shiny, shiny packaging, it&#x27;s a small, small jar. Dare I say, a Clarisonic will give you similar results and will be a better investment in the long-run.</li>
    <li> Once you get past the tingling - which to be honest really isn&#x27;t THAT bad, this is a great product.  Leaves my face feeling soft and very clean.  Comes off easily too.</li>
    <li> I would use this seller again product was as stated.</li>
    <li> i bought in December, 2014. Loved it at 1st. Now, even though it has been tightly closed, stored in drawer away from light, the contents are hard and dried out. so i cannot use it any more even though it became this consistency after only 3-4 months.</li>
    <li> i have been using this mask for 2 yrs now. Cant live without it!&lt;br /&gt;i have a complex skin, and i use it once a week for deep cleansing. I use it on my face and neck.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin super soft and feeling refreshed and renewed! Smells great also. I do have some face sensitivity, so it does tingle, a very mild burn almost, when I first put it on but it goes away quickly. Helps me maintain how oily my face can be.</li>
    <li> Basically this product works awesome!! It does everything it says it will do except it does not last three days....(that would be my only complaint) My skin looks so much better after I am done using this product and feels great too.&lt;br /&gt;I should also mention the fact that there is a little burning feeling while its drying....not just a &amp;#34;tingeling sensation&amp;#34;,at least for me.</li>
    <li> This has really helped dry up my oily skin and shrunk my more pores considerably! Will defiantly be buying again.</li>
    <li> Quite painful, but effective</li>
    <li> Not worth the money. Can buy a drugstore mask that does the same thing!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for giving your skin a quick boost. It brings a nice color to your skin, removes the dead surface cells and makes your skin very smooth.  I&#x27;ve purchased this before from other retailers and once again Amazon Smile beats their price hands on and I don&#x27;t have to drive to the store !&lt;br /&gt;I use this primarily when I travel for work, in different time zones when I am usually very tired.  It makes my skin look revived when I don&#x27;t feel that way at all.</li>
    <li> i just used one time, and feel like my face get better, looks more shiny shiny shiny shiny, ha ha ha , i will still buy that.</li>
    <li> I think it is really good for a guy as well. I will buy it again. Thank you for the cheap price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used both this and the GLAMGLOW Super-MudTM Clearing Treatment. I prefer the clearing. The tingle here isn&#x27;t too bad. I prefer the feel of the other mask though.</li>
    <li> I am 40 and have had acne problems since my teens. Big pores and t zone. I have tries everything but there is nothing that works as good as this mask! Absolutely love it. Someone wrote it is to harsh to wash off, but I just a soakes cloth and it doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin at all. I am allergic to most stuff out there, but still, this works great for me!!</li>
    <li> I attend many semi formal and formal events.  This is great for use prior to applying makeup for a more polished looked.  Helps to exfoliate any dry, flaky skin and a lot better than regular facial scrubs I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  This product is mostly grandular so be cautious not to scrub too hard or too long as I feel it could create raw skin.</li>
    <li> I have to admit I really thought this was hype. Typically when you have a product with wasteful extra packaging and an exorbitant cost it&#x27;s usually hype. This one actually surprised me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In my opinion they could make this more consumer price friendly by getting rid of the cheesy environmentally unfriendly extra packaging and let the products results speak for itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to have my mother try this out at the same time as me to test out how well it works on a different skin type than mine (hers is aging normal skin with some loss of elasticity and hyper-pigmentation). The most dramatic results were on my mother. She was hooked almost immediately. This took 10 years off her face and on my acne prone sensitive skin it tighten all my pores and gave my skin it&#x27;s glow back. We were both surprised and impressed. We are both non-practicing estheticians (she is retired, i do professional makeup instead of esthetics) and had both taken classes on Volcanic Ash and it&#x27;s anti-aging properties but had never tried it on ourselves. That stuff is a miracle worker! This is definitely part of my recommended pre-big event skincare set. You want to have younger looking skin before a big event use this mask then follow with a SK-II substrate facial mask and your skin will be plump, tight, and glowing for your event. I&#x27;ve tried this out several times and every time my clients fall in love with the products and get a fantastic self esteem boost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t notice much long term effects on my skin but my mother reported that her hyper pigmentation has lightened with continued use. For me, the tightening effect wears off after about 2 days but my skin still looks clearer and i&#x27;m having less clogging and acne around my nose and chin. I didn&#x27;t care for the chopped up green tea leaves in this product, would have made more sense to grind them up so the entire product wouldn&#x27;t be so chunky but it works so i&#x27;ll overlook it. If you are shy on the price get a couple of girlfriends together for a wine and face mask night and split the cost of a jar between you to try it out without shelling out the full amount up front. I think you&#x27;ll be hooked once you try it. :)le of girlfriends together for a wine and face mask night and split the cost of a jar between you to try it out without shelling out the full amount up front. I think you&#x27;ll be hooked once you try it. :)</li>
    <li> As a cleansing mask, it can be a choice. But it is a little exaggerated about its efficacy. The performance-to-price ratio is not very high.</li>
    <li> I bought this for both  my twenty something daughter and myself and neither of us were impressed.  We read all of the hype and it didn&#x27;t come close to living up to it.  I finally threw it away because it dried up.</li>
    <li> Pricey but definitely does the job. I love how soft my skin feels after using it. It makes me glow. Certainly recommed it</li>
    <li> Its a great mask.  Not sure why some of the ingredients are still whole (looks like leaves) but my skin feels fantastic after.</li>
    <li> When I first tried the sample, it was amazing! I can visually see my pores being purged from impurities, but as I begin using the product more I didn&#x27;t see any major changes in my skin. I continued to receive break outs and didn&#x27;t see any results after using the product for several weeks. I will not be repurchasing this product.</li>
    <li> it does not work for me.</li>
    <li> Wow.  Saw an immediate difference in my skin after using the sample I received in my monthly Glossybox subscription.  This stuff is expensive, but better than any mask I have ever tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a LOT.  It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great product. A good exfoliation without being harsh on your skin. You can tell its working with the tingle, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I got it after seeing this is what lots of the &amp;#34;stars&amp;#34; were using right before a big event.  The product definitely makes my skin feel great, tighter and brighter, but it isn&#x27;t DRAMATIC results as they had claimed.  I&#x27;d get the product again.</li>
    <li> This is the only facemask that I truly notice a difference with every single time. It makes me skin so much healthier, it makes make up look better. It is so worth every penny.</li>
    <li> After one use of this, I got a compliment from someone who said my skin looks like porcelain! I have never in my life gotten a compliment on my skin because I have mild acne scars/pink spots. It seemed to lighten them a tiny bit after one use and my overall complexion looks SO incredibly bright. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use another face mask besides this one again.</li>
    <li> This is nothing special, leaves your skin smooth after you use it, but as far as any glow, I don&#x27;t think it holds up to the hype.</li>
    <li> This product was highly recommended. I have used it a few times but was not too impressed with it. A little pricey for the results.</li>
    <li> I have been using this weekly for the last 3 weeks.  I really like the product,  It makes my face so smooth and clean.  I simply do not have time to spend half a day at a spa.  This works well for me and makes my face feel great.  I will order again when I run out.</li>
    <li> It gives a glow that lasts for 3 days. Do not use more than twice a week. You will end up with grey dull skin. I use a moisturizing mask afterwards. Seems to tone down breakouts. Should come in a tube instead of a jar. I have a feeling it will dry quickly.&lt;br /&gt;The price on amazon is great.</li>
    <li> This is a great mud mask.  It makes my skin very smooth.  The couple of things that i don&#x27;t like is that  It does have a strong perfume smell to it and pieces of black leaves in it, which I don&#x27;t care for. I use this product before applying my make up.  It smooths lines and makes make up look flawless.  I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> The product is good, but the reviews and the price I expected more of this product. I thought he was better.</li>
    <li> If you suspect you get a fake or a bad bottle from Amazon, Glamglow will NOT help you as Amazon isn&#x27;t a licensed seller. I tried a sample of this and loved it. I bought a full size here and it made my face hurt after 30 seconds. :( Glamglow wasn&#x27;t able to tell me if it was a fake or a bad batch, so I&#x27;m out $40.</li>
    <li> As long as five minutes on the face is very good, touch, feel face sacks bulging at the seams.But face the thin part tingling violently</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with glamglow! My skin feels so refreshed after using this product!</li>
    <li> I have had this stuff before, so this is a reorder.  It is wonderful.  I love it.  Makes my skin so clean and feels good!</li>
    <li> I love this mask, my face is soft and glowing. It&#x27;s so simple to use, you don&#x27;t need much to achieve fantastic results. Your skin will feel smooth, fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> i choose glam glow from the product title and it true let your face to glow and i like it so much i recommend for and lady that she is hard worker to have it</li>
    <li> I purchased this after receiving a sample. My daughter uses this regularly on her acne prone skin. You can see the mask pulling oil out of the pores as it dries. Final result is brighter, softer skin. One word of warning- this product can sting, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I gave this product 5 star cuz it really work with my skin.  i recommend this mask for both men and women, i used it 2 days in a week my skin look more glow with or without makeup.</li>
    <li> This stuff is magical. Use as little as possible per application. I glopped it on the first time and cried as it burned!</li>
    <li> i like it, i thought it&#x27;s good when i didn&#x27;t try the white jar, after using the white jar, i found that this one is good, but the white one is great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not too much of a mask person but when I went to Sephora, the salesperson said this was the best face mask out there.  So I tried it and had to agree!  It makes your face feel SOOOO clean and fresh, and rejuvenated!  This one is good in that you can put it on as a mask, but when you&#x27;re ready to wash it off, you wet your face slightly and then use it as an exfoliator.  So it&#x27;s two products in one.  And it goes a long way.  You don&#x27;t have to use too much to cover your face.  The only thing though is that it might have a weird smell when you first use it, but you get used to it and don&#x27;t even notice it the next time or few times after.  Also, it&#x27;s a mud mask, so your face looks gray and you might look scary with it on :o) so don&#x27;t use it in front of others or they might laugh.  :O)  It&#x27;s way cheaper on amazon vice in Sephora.  :o)  I tried the white bottle one that comes with it (the Sephora one) but that one didn&#x27;t seem like anything special.  So I&#x27;d only recommend the black bottle one.  :O)</li>
    <li> So glad I tried this treatment.  Refreshing on my face and really tightens the pores while gently exfoliating.</li>
    <li> It truly works it leaves my face feeling soft and fresh, I will continue to use,, ideal for a special occasion to get your face to glow, some times I don&#x27;t even need to wear any makeup because my face looks neutrally beautiful,, I love this product</li>
    <li> It is as described - a miracle in a small jar. I wish it came in a larger size</li>
    <li> Great product, arrived as scheduled</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried as yet. Otherwise, everything was okay.....</li>
    <li> This mud mask was just gentle enough for my skin. It did a decent job of cleaning out my pores and gave my skin a fresh glow. Great product!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Love how smooth &amp; clear my face looks after using!!</li>
    <li> I refused to buy this in Sephora for $60, so when I saw it on Amazon I was thrilled to try it. It works fantastically for me, and I especially love all the gunk it draws out of your face. Just don&#x27;t expect life altering changes the first time you use it. Give it a week or two with regular usage (twice a week) and you will definitely see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S I have struggled with acne/combination skin and although this is a bit gritty, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my face. This has cleared up minor blemishes/blackheads wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I love how this feels after you rinse off your mask. Your skin truly feels silky soft! But as soon as you apply it feels like your skin is on fire! It&#x27;ll only last a few secs but still..OUCH! I&#x27;m giving it a 4 because it really does a great job, pain is beauty...right?!</li>
    <li> Excellent mask! The result is seen right away. The face looks instantly radiant and fresh. I would order it again without thinking twice.</li>
    <li> It is a great exfoliating mask. I love the way my face feels after I take it off. I look visibly brighter. I choose four stars because you don&#x27;t get very much product for the price. I probably will buy again but not anytime soon.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to make this purchase, mainly because it is a little pricy. But after seeing the positive rating, I figured it was worth a shot- and I&#x27;m so glad I gave it a shot! I&#x27;ve tried nearly every facial wash/mask/product out there, but I&#x27;ve never seen anything like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did applying it in general feel amazing, but I was left with an incredible glow, and my skin felt healthier after just the first day! My face felt softer as soon as I washed it off, and to my surprise it actually stayed that way. The biggest problem with my skin is that I have always struggled with acne, but every time a face wash gets close to working, it leaves me with dry skin- but this product is an entirely different story. It cleared my skin, and helped to moisturize it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> I love both the white and black glam glow and I am a mask collector. To find it at this price have it arrive in perfect new condition, Happeh.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by a friend and it did not disappoint.  I have been using it once a week for a month now and my skin looks even more healthy and feels cleaner.  I&#x27;ve never had issues with acne but do have trouble cleaning out the pores good.  This does that job and the smell is like being at the spa.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of facial masks but this one really does what it promises. Pores are clean and look smaller and skin feels wonderful. Not cheap but worth the price.</li>
    <li> I Loved it, but found it a little more expensive for the quantity of the item. It does in deed&lt;br /&gt;produce results for stubborn black heads.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to fall in love with this when I got a sample from sephora because I knew what it cost. I don&#x27;t need anymore expensive beauty habits/products. I was previously using exfolikate and was pretty satisfied with it. This changed everything!! In one sample, I could tell a noticeable difference in my skin afterwards. My skin feels super clean, soft, and very taunt. I love it and had to order, so I ordered from Amazon since it was cheaper. I even have my mom on this stuff now!</li>
    <li> this product is no big deal.  I will no be ordering again.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t the best smelling mask but it felt very natural not like you are putting chemicals on your face. Overall it was good.</li>
    <li> Face feels instantly softer and smoother.  You can see the mask working at all the blackheads and pores.  Most amazing beauty product purchased</li>
    <li> At the time of initially writing my review the cost of this mask was $36 not $50. I stand by my comments for the lower price. If you need to pay $50+ for it I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s really not that much of a miracle product to justify buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an expensive mask but it goes a long way, you don&#x27;t use the whole jar in one go. For me it comes to $4 per application and even less if I only use it as a spot/problem area treatment. If it&#x27;ll make you feel better, Sephora sells it for much more than how much you pay here. I have sensitive skin prone to breakouts and using this mask once a week has resulted in big improvement. These days it&#x27;s very rare for me to get a break out. The warming tingle you experience from it is quite intense but it goes away in a few minutes. There&#x27;s no redness residue as with some other menthol based masks. As with any other beauty product that comes in a multi-use jar I would suggest you scoop how much you need with a spoon and not keep dipping your fingers in the jar to introduce bacteria.</li>
    <li> I use this once per week to keep my pores clean and fresh. The effects of this mask last for about that long up until then, thats just how good it is. I apply it on my T-zone, my cheeks and my chin, anywhere really that I know has larger pores, flakiness or small bits of acne or old acne scars. This stuff takes care of the whole thing and delivers a beautiful job in making my skin flawless and this is a great deal considering it costs I think 70 dollars on Sephora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned though, this stuff you wash off with your fingers and acts like a scrub so be prepared for redness and also immediate dryness. Either apply your skincare immediately or do what I do and that is use a moisturizing cloth mask next. My cloth mask is basically coated with a crap ton of serum to treat my skin and give it a good moisturizing boost. The cloth mask I use are \\&quot;My Beauty Diary\\&quot; and I specifically recommend the \\&quot;My Beauty Diary Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing Mask\\&quot; Which I highly recommend to go with the glam glow if you wish to achieve the best skin ever. Worry not, its considerably cheap and you get a lot of masks with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, get the Glam Glow. Its amazing and worth your money.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product and tried it before I purchased it. My first impression was EEWWW!!! Chunky green muck with lumpy leaves. But since I already had it in my hand I bravely applied it to my face. I didn&#x27;t leave it on for more than 10 minutes before the &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; (read as BURNING SENSATION) got to me &amp; in a panic I rinsed it off.&lt;br /&gt;My God, within an hour my skin felt so soft, felt to good, and had a healthy glow to it. At that moment I had to have it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using this I suggest covering your sink drain with muslin or cheesecloth to prevent blocking up your drain as the leafs are abundant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with this product!</li>
    <li> Great product! I love glam glow, it has implement transformed my skin! I would highly recommend this product to everyone</li>
    <li> I am loving this mask! The first time I tried it, I was sure I was going to have a full blown case of hives. This stuff stings! But, after the stinging (only about 3 minutes), the mask dries and washes off nicely. My skin loves me when I do this and I have been using it for a month now, every three days or so. Even my husband likes it (both the stinging and the smoothness afterwards). I will be repurchasing this or trying a different one from this brand soon!</li>
    <li> A little bit into the old bottle packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Inside the mask used a small amount of iconicity.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging there is no manual.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen this on youtube and a bunch of other sites. The reviews looked good, so I thought I&#x27;d try it. I like how it makes my skin feel and my boyfriend has tried it too. He is a huge fan as well. It makes my skin feel really stiff while it&#x27;s drying and I can kind of see it pulling the grossness out. Washing it off feels so great! It&#x27;s a little muddy so I recommend washing it off in the shower- I usually do that with most masks anyway because I wind up making a mess on the bathroom counter otherwise. Anyway, I really like this and will buy again. It&#x27;s a little pricey but if you use it sparingly, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I had the pleasure of receiving many samples from sephora, but it wasn&#x27;t enough! $69 is way too much at the store too, so I figured I would look around. I am SO GLAD that I found this for only $34! I will definitely keep it in my regimen.</li>
    <li> Still feeling this one</li>
    <li> Really useful. Pores are cleaned and I could feel that my skin is smoother every time after I use it.</li>
    <li> So so so expensive!! The packaging is overdone, the container is tiny and what is inside is even less!! I hate to say this, but it doesn&#x27;t work miracles either!! I guess it does kinda make you fee &amp;#34;glamorous&amp;#34; because the bottle is black, it smells really good, it has little leaves inside, and you paid a ton of money for it.  But if you&#x27;re actually looking for a product to change your skin, this isn&#x27;t it! The best mask I&#x27;ve ever tried that actually helped acne and reduced the visibility of my pores is Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay...and that was like 10 bucks.  This Glamglow is just a clever scam.</li>
    <li> umm when i finished the masking, its seams works on my face, which means looks &amp;#34;glam&amp;#34; because bring out some dash and dust on face.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It brightens my skin.</li>
    <li> I am at the point where buying drug store masks just doesn&#x27;t work.  They typically have minimal if any benefits.  That is not true of this product.  This mask works wonders for your skin.  It makes skin so soft and smooth after application - remember to follow the directions and buff it off rather than just wipe so you get the full exfoliating benefits.  Also, I have noticed that it tightens my pores and seems to prevent breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;One note, I got this from Sephora as a sample but couldn&#x27;t stand the $60 plus dollar price for the full product size.  Thank you Amazon for offering a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I am knocking this mask one star is that it does have a distinctive scent that takes getting used to at first.</li>
    <li> Will not buy it again</li>
    <li> I have oily skin that isn&#x27;t super sensitive, but I had a bad reaction to this mask. The \\&quot;tingling sensation\\&quot; isn&#x27;t at all pleasant and kicks in as soon as you put the mask on. After 10 minutes it hardens almost completely, and you exfoliate when you wash it off. I definitely noticed some improvements in the way my skin looked (brighter, smoother, etc.), but I also had some redness on my face and some dry patches, which weren&#x27;t there when I applied the mask a few minutes earlier. I guess it all depends on your skin type, but I personally usually do well with most products, and the side effects with this product are excessive. I do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I saw great reviews on this product.  I have used it several times and did not find that it made much difference in my skin.  It did not perform any better than an over the counter exfoliant.  Very dissappointed.  Would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I got a sample size in my GlossyBox subscription and I fell in love. It&#x27;s $69 everywhere else I&#x27;ve looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sample I got is 0.5oz and I got 4 uses out of it. I don&#x27;t think it needs to be applied super thick, because i apply it thin and the results are still incredible. Got this jar in the mail, it&#x27;s small but it is not tiny. It&#x27;s definitely worth it though, I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing</li>
    <li> It didnt do anything for me</li>
    <li> I covet everything GlamGlow makes and was delighted to find their products in bigger sizes and much cheaper on Amazon as opposed to Sephora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask is FANTASTIC. It&#x27;s a great exfoliator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin specialists will tell you that ideally you would get a facial every two weeks to have that perfect skin we are all after but I work in nonprofit and could never afford that and who has time for that frequent an appointment anyways?! GlamGlow is the way to go! Do it on your own time and as frequently as YOU need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a miracle one-time use mask. This is an exfoliant that should be part of your regular skin routine - how regular is up to you. When I first became addicted to the GlamGlow family I was using this tingling mask about once a week and the clearing mask (white packaging) 2-3 times a week. I am 23 and have only ever had two facials in my life which is still two more than most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask is a great way to get rid of those dry patches either from daily acne cleansers that may occasionally dry out skin or just from your environment (I live in the desert and have dry skin frequently). It&#x27;s also great to even out combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well to make your pores appear smaller but to truly have smaller pores, you should use the clearing mud mask in conjunction with this so that the dirt and oils in those pores can first be removed, then shrunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need GlamGlow. Get this. Now.</li>
    <li> Love the treatment&lt;br /&gt;Used once a week</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product that my 14 year old and myself both use.  You can feel it working and feel so refreshed after!  Love it!</li>
    <li> i love this mask, even though it smell not very good, but the result is really good, i love it</li>
    <li> I have had some breakout from adult acne.This mask makes the skin feel wonderful, shrinks pores and dries up problem areas. I also use it as a spot treatment at night. I am sure i use it more then recommended....but it has made a difference.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I love the tingling feeling when I applied it to my face. I could really tell a difference right away! I will recommend this product to anyone with pore issues and black heads! Also, the delivery was fast and I was fully satisfied with my order.</li>
    <li> Wow, this works really great, but I don&#x27;t really like the big black pieces in it, it does work great though!</li>
    <li> I like who this mask clears and scrubs your face but what I don&#x27;t like is how fast this one dries up in the jar!...such a waist of money...mine dried up after 4 uses</li>
    <li> Very drying. It improved blemishes overnight if I applyed it before bed.</li>
    <li> Worth every cent! I must admit i did get scared when a hunk of Tea leaf came out of the jar - but all good - this works wonders at improving the pores on the face!</li>
    <li> The youth mask is great.I love how my skin feels after I have used it.it&#x27;s only a ten min mask so I can even do it before I go to work (which I have) and getting it off is easy as well. I would not recommend doing it every day...that&#x27;s what a worker at sephora said, it could dry out your skin (especially for younger people). I only use it once or twice a week</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet  but it looks super cool&lt;br /&gt;And everyone is talking about it so why not buying it ?</li>
    <li> I really really like it!!</li>
    <li> A little itching when you wear this mask. After 10 minutes, I didn&#x27;t see much changed, only the face looked cleaner.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product!  It works!</li>
    <li> When my daughter first told me about how Glam Glow cleaned her face and got rid of all the white and black heads after only two time she used it, and how it left her skin clear and smooth, I didn&#x27;t really believe her; I had to use it myself to see the results: astonishing! Glam Glow really does what it says it does, and I will recommend it to everyone. I will buy it again and again!</li>
    <li> Love this product. I use it each day. Will see if it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
    <li> Not so good. It turns dry after a few times I used it. So I have to apply some water to use it. And the pore did not get smaller or cleaned after using this.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery.  Love the smell of this mask and how it makes my skin feel!</li>
    <li> Got to me in a timely matter and I loved how smooth my skin looked afterwards.</li>
    <li> At the first time, the package was lost. And after I submit the report, AMAZON sent me another one. The service of AMAZON is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Then I will write my feeling of GLAMGLOW. It&#x27;s so useful! After I used it at first time, I can feel my skin became smoothly. And it made me white. I REALLY love it!</li>
    <li> The best mask I have ever tried.  It leaves my skin feeling amazingly soft and looks glowing.</li>
    <li> I ordered 3 of the these for my teenage granddaughters. they arrived NEW ( I saw many reviews that stated otherwise) in very nice sealed packaging. the product makes your face feel super soft, clean, and fresh. we all love using it.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s just nothing better than Glam Glow.  This is my second tub, and I am hooked.  It&#x27;s like a spa treatment that leaves your skin feeling baby-soft and radiant.  The texture is thick but you really don&#x27;t need a thick layer - it&#x27;s expensive so I usually spread it as thin as I can, and it still works wonders.  I like to put it on before a bath so some of it steams into my skin as well.  Treat yourself and splurge on Glam Glow - it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
    <li> My 22-year-old daughter asked for this for Christmas, because she had tried a sample and loved it. I saw how expensive it is, but hey, it was Christmas...she absolutely recommends this product for anyone. Works great!</li>
    <li> The winter weather is making my skin dry and puffy. This mud mask totally soothes my skin. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Love the product and have used many times. It comes in a nice black box but sadly when I opened the one I received this week this is how it looked inside.</li>
    <li> works well. clearly clean the pores but it doesn&#x27;t work with the blackhead and acne. Anyway, as a deep clean mask for skin, it works not bad!</li>
    <li> The product was clearly old and should&#x27;ve never been sold retail. I work in the beauty industry and was appalled that a store would sell such old product. The only reason I&#x27;m giving then two stars is that even though it was dried out I was able to put water in the product to somewhat salvage.</li>
    <li> This stuff is with every penny! I would pay more for  it. I use this stuff when ever I am going out for a social event. My skin looks and feels great after. The feeling can get a little intense but it&#x27;s because of the menthol. The lava that is in the mask is so fine and really gets the job done( best exfoliant I&#x27;ve ver tried). you only need a thin layer. Very good product and very good price. I used to pay 69 for it at sephora. The white mask is also great, it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate though I use that one mostly for spot treatment for my acne.</li>
    <li> Totally worth the money!  Leaves your skin baby smooth, my pores shrunk tremedously, and it balanced out my oily/dry areas.  It can be a bit rough on sensitive skin so I only use it about once a week</li>
    <li> Love Glam Glow.  Great price!</li>
    <li> Horrible Heard amazing things, but it made me break out HORRIBLY!!! I have large pimples all over my face!!! I would literally never put this on my face again. If you have sensitive skin, DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this my skin felt like it was on fire. But that only lasted for like 30 seconds. When i washed it off, my skin felt so soft and smooth! The next day my dad told me my skin looked more healthy! My pores were smaller so makeup looked 10x better! I absolutely love this stuff and have been recommending it to everyone! The only thing i hate is that there is not a lot of product in here. After 4 uses I&#x27;m like 1/3rd done with it</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this product but don&#x27;t really see any difference in this brand versus the cheaper brands so overall not worth the price.</li>
    <li> Let me begin this review by saying I do not have sensitive skin. I have never put something on my face that has burned it as harshly as this Glam Glow mask. I thankfully got a free sample of this mask at Sephora, because if I had paid 70 dollars for it there I would have been furious. Within 30 seconds of putting this on my skin, my face started burning and turning red. I quickly rinsed it off, but my face still tingled for a long time after. Yes, I know this mask is supposed to tingle, but it should not burn or make my skin red. It should also not reek of perfumes and for the price tag, it has every paraben in the book. No thanks.</li>
    <li> I do not really see what all the fuss is about. I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and do not really see much of a difference. This product is overpriced as well.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing mask. I was hesitant to purchase it because it&#x27;s so expensive, but I am so glad I did! My sister has the original mask, but we both like this one better because of how well it exfoliates. It&#x27;s almost as good as microdermabrasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would question about this product is the big tea leaves in the mask. They are pretty gross to put on your face and give the mask a really inconsistent texture. I&#x27;ve had my mask for a few months now (it will last you a long time!) and it is starting to dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a really nice mask that cleans out and tightens your pores, gives a great exfoliation, and leaves you glowing!</li>
    <li> The missus loves it to death and swears by it. Who am I to argue?</li>
    <li> this mask is really great I just tried it on my face. I expected more results (because everyone is raving about it)&lt;br /&gt;But I like it, I really do. my face feels smooth and clear and tight but it dries your face you must moisturize it.&lt;br /&gt;I think it has the same effect as the Indian Clay (Indian Clay comes in a huge HUGE jar with a very cheap price and its much better than GlamGlow in my opinion at least ; Indian Clay is sold in Amazon and it made my face very tight and glowing)&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, GlamGlow comes in a small jar and is expensive compared to Indian Clay</li>
    <li> AMAZING. Tingles strongly at first, afterwards skin feels super tight and not in a great way but put some moisturizer on and OMG your skin glows. Going to post some before and after pictures in the customer pictures if I am allowed to.</li>
    <li> The product is one of my favorite. The mask is very good for my skin. The shipment and delivery was on time, I will recommend this product to my friends</li>
    <li> This product really cleaned up my pores and left my skin very soft.  Very easy to use and easy to remove</li>
    <li> Love this product!  It leaves my face so smooth and glowing for days!  Definitely worth the price for this product.</li>
    <li> As another reviewer has noted, this is an aggressively marketed product and all of that marketing is included in the price. For what it does, it&#x27;s waaaay over-priced so if there&#x27;s a more affordable and reliable mud mask you use, keep it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will exfoliate and tighten your skin for the night. When I used it twice a week for three weeks I did notice that my skin was more even-toned but I&#x27;m positive I would get the same results with a cheaper product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the smell is a bit much: over-powering perfume smell like you rubbed a magazine sample on your face.  I dunno, maybe some women like that.</li>
    <li> This truly is the most wonderful product I&#x27;ve ever used.  The mask is so strong you can only apply it 3 days a week and get excellent results.  No need to buy numerous other products that maybe less expensive none of which will give half the results.  I apply Glamglow while I dry my hair and wash off with a wash cloth and warm water.  This product is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Love this mask/exfoliator! I love to use the ThirstMud after this one.</li>
    <li> I Love this product! I&#x27;m always trying products to compare what is best and this product is worth spending on! Outstanding Product!</li>
    <li> Well, Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;ve had better. I&#x27;m 68 and I must say L&#x27;BRI facial masque is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, immediate results!</li>
    <li> Love it! It stung for a bit when you first apply.  However, the results are awesome.  I felt my pores getting smaller and skin felt so smooth.  I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used mud masks in the past...but never one quite like this. The grains are pumice...the same thing used in foot scrubs. I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, but this would be a no-go unless the texture of your facial skin resembles that of the bottoms of your feet. The chunks of tea leaves is also really weird and quite frankly just grossed me out because they look nasty and slimy. On the positive side, when I tested it on the back of my hand it made my hands really soft, so maybe I will keep it as a hand and foot treatment.</li>
    <li> Strong cleaning, face feels a little bit painful</li>
    <li> Love this Product so much it&#x27;s the best face mask ever!</li>
    <li> Recommended by a friend and I love the product.  I even got my husband to try it with me.  Overall, I will purchase this again for myself and maybe as a Christmas present for some girlfriends.</li>
    <li> Just What Wife Was Looking For at a Great Price. Shopped all over where it was priced over $70. New sealed.</li>
    <li> This is a very, very good facial mask.  It&#x27;s quite different from anything I&#x27;ve ever used.  It tingles a bit, and can be a bit challenging to spread because of the leaves in the jar.  However, I am very pleased with the results.  I definitely plan to purchase this again.</li>
    <li> works ok as a mask but dried up very quickly.  not worth the money I spend.  would rather buy a facial.</li>
    <li> Alright, so I literally did a side by side comparison with a $3 mud mask- I put this on half my face and the cheapo one on the other side- and they both looked exactly the same as before I put on either.  I even left a bit of my face uncovered by both to see if it as least made my skin smoother or softer as it claims, and nope. I don&#x27;t know how to trust buying high end beauty products online anymore because my friend in cosmetology says a lot of it is knock-offs (apparantly you have to have a cos license to sell these things and how do you know if the seller has one or if perhaps they bought it off someone with a cos license, etc.), but I bought the sample off ebay for about $8 and I was entirely disappointed. somebody on pinterest said that it extracts pimples, maybe it was the other one in the white jar or maybe it didn&#x27;t work because I have no pimples, but I&#x27;m starting to lose my faith in high end products. They seem to be only minimally better than the cheap crap from the store. Try St. Ives Apricot blackhead scrub. It dries up your zits in a second and it really does seem to make my face look tighter and brighter.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s so good for face.</li>
    <li> The product is good. But somewhere else is cheaper than Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is good for:&lt;br /&gt;Dry flaky skin&lt;br /&gt;Last luster dull skin&lt;br /&gt;instant results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask is bad for:&lt;br /&gt;people with acne problems.&lt;br /&gt;this reason being, the mask is VERY abrasive. People with acne may cause injury to their skin using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this sample from sephora. The purchase price there is around 60 per jar. Buy here.</li>
    <li> Works just ok not as wonderful as I thought it would be shipped fast</li>
    <li> This mask is amazing, my only complaint is that I feel as if once you start using it, you can&#x27;t stop because your pores adjust to it.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING! It tingles as the mask dries. Then when you scrub your face &amp; rinse it off, it feels wonderful! It&#x27;s like a facial in a jar! Your skin will glow and look refreshed. This is my second jar. VERY pleased with the results and the product!</li>
    <li> After reading so many positive review.. I gave it a go.. Only positive surprise it does work! I don&#x27;t think I can live without it and recommend to all my mates. The sting feeling only takes in for less than a minute and bearable.. Love it!</li>
    <li> I use this once a week as part of my facial ritual. Seems to help pull out the impurities.</li>
    <li> I ordered this mask after reading other reviews...and it is all they said it would be and more.  I use it twice a week and see the difference in my skin over these past few weeks.  More radiant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would encourage anyone sitting on the fence over the purchase of this product to definitely go for it!</li>
    <li> The item is faked. I used glamglow from sephora before. The texture and the color is so different. Also my skin started to burn and irritate after use</li>
    <li> so expensive! but works nice, it has small leaves and branches.. fyi . took me by surprise but sorta minty ? ;)</li>
    <li> This mask is by far one of the superior masks I&#x27;ve used. I have large pores and when I use this mask it eliminates ALL of them. My skin comes out glowing! When I walked into my dermatologist&#x27;s office he said my skin has never looked so good. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My wife love it, hope the magical story reviewed over the internet could happen to my wife and make her happy.</li>
    <li> One of the best masks I have used!  It is addictive!  Be sure to keep top on tight as it tends to get a little dried out, but you can add a drop of water to moisten.</li>
    <li> I really like this mask, which turned out really are tea and tea Terrier, and tastes very good smell, exhausted after a very comfortable</li>
    <li> words on package is a little different, rest of them are absolutely the same. This would make you glow really on any events.</li>
    <li> Ok before you dump the money on this take 1 part Queen Helene Cocoa Butter Scrub and mix it with 1 part Queen Helene&#x27;s Mint Julep Mask. If you feel you must, open a green tea bag and put some of the leaves in it. Then use it the same way. Because that&#x27;s basically what you&#x27;re getting with this. I like mud masks and I like really scrubby scrubs but this one was exceptionally unexceptional and I can&#x27;t believe they&#x27;re charging what they are for it. I feel like a big sucka for buying it. Will not rebuy and yes I agree with the reviewer that said &amp;#34;Clarisonic&amp;#34;. Love mine.</li>
    <li> I would have given it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for the price :-( Love this stuff on my acne prone skin. It can be a little drying but I love the tingly feeling and rosy, glowing look it leaves on my 41 year old stubborn skin.</li>
    <li> It delivers as promoted. My skin has shown benefits of being smoother and firmer. It also shrinks pores and exfoliates nicely.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this product and it&#x27;s the best price for it anywhere.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm to draw out impurities.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this because it comes so highly rated. But it did absolutely nothing for my skin. My pores looked exactly the same after using this. Additionally, there are grains of pumice in this. Pumice is something that should never be near the delicate skin on your face. I was scared to accidentally scratch myself and had to apply it so gingerly. Finally, there are big chunks of tea leaves that make this even more difficult to apply. This was a very expensive mistake.</li>
    <li> Instant brightening. Who cares if it feels like a foot cream. It&#x27;s exfoliating that&#x27;s what a mask is all about. It&#x27;s amazing and I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love ... Talk about a glow!</li>
    <li> Work good feels great. The only thing I wish it came with is something to apply it.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of this product but thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It is amazing! When you rub it into your face, you can see the tea leaves. It slightly burns/tingles when you apply it to your face and it can be a bit messy but its worth it because 15 minutes later when you gently wipe it off, your face feels exfoliated. I have oily skin in the T-zones but I found if I use this mask once every couple of weeks, I can keep my face oils in check. I&#x27;d definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This mask is amazing. Every now and then i get small bumps on my forhead and when i use this mask it exfoliates that issue and by morning my skin is glowing...LOVE THIS PRODUCT...worth every penny.</li>
    <li> very irritating to skin.</li>
    <li> It is pricy for a small jar but it is one of the few facial packs actually worked on my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;It became one of my must items now.</li>
    <li> Wow&lt;br /&gt;Firstly I like the smell.... When i am using it , my skin feels like burning .. But this is the effect that how the mud mask working haha&lt;br /&gt;After I clean the mask, my  skin is like silk  and I really really like the mask!</li>
    <li> Literally works overnight. I wash my face and put this on after and let it dry up a bit right before I go to bed and the next day my face is clear or has significantly reduced the size of stubborn pimples. Also leaves skin with a nice glow. LOVE THIS and will be getting more!</li>
    <li> My professional wedding makeup artist swears by this product. I used it twice with my mom the week before my wedding and it feels amazing. It makes your skin tight and glows!</li>
    <li> This is definitely one of the better vendors. A+ shopping experience; top quality product; super fast service. I would recommend them without reservation.</li>
    <li> I really scored on this product .My face is smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom .Got  to contuine using this .The smell is also a plus.WORKS well in as little as 10 minutes.Thanks to the Salt lake City news lady ( Shawna ) for sharing this product</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m new to exfoliating as I have dry sensative skin. And this really does do what it says. I let it dry. Loosen it up with my clarisonic, rinse off with warm water. Pat dry then folow with maracuja oil. And my skin the next morning was glowing and soft, not dry and red like I anticipated.</li>
    <li> This is one of the messier facial products I have used.  It works well though and brings all impurities right to your skin&#x27;s surface.  Pimples or blotchiness after is common apparently.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I usually do the treatment once a week. Usually on Friday or Saturday, depending on whether I&#x27;m going out that night or not. If you want to look rock star for a night out, this is the treatment you want before you hit the bars/clubs. I usually add the eye mude treatment as well (also by Glamglow), so my eyes pop. This stuff makes you look red carpet ready for a night on the town.</li>
    <li> I will use this product for many years.  It far exceeds my expectations.  It&#x27;s easy to use and my skin looks totally fresh with an earthy glow,  from the first use.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, love the way it makes my face feel.  I will defiantly order more when I run out</li>
    <li> Although a little messy, it smells great and feels great on the skin. I reordered this product because there is not much in the bottle.</li>
    <li> Product more wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Product beyond description&lt;br /&gt;I advise everyone Bsthaddamh Genuine First, because he was sure of it personally&lt;br /&gt;I am very wonderful wonderful performance&lt;br /&gt;I loved this product.</li>
    <li> I was so excited for this mask, and thought that the 38 bucked i spent for it here on amazon was a steal. Used it, it did absolutely nothing. NOTHING. I prefer my $3.99 freeman mint and lemon mask that actually clears my pores and does a great job. I really regret this purchase, and I don&#x27;t understand why everyone is raving over it. I will try again, and see what happens, but you can purchase a cheaper mask that does way more. SOOO ANGRY.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read some other reviews on this product on here before purchasing and I don&#x27;t understand some of the complaints. It does say it is an exfoliating mask and it does not claim to be all natural. Going to the products website to read the ingredients before purchasing is a good idea before you purchase any facial product so you know that you will not be allergic to anything in the product.</li>
    <li> Not sure about all the hype with this product.  It&#x27;s good as a general mask and for exfoliating, but it&#x27;s not that special.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff so much!!</li>
    <li> This stuff does wonders. It tingles a bit and exfoliates really well. A little goes a long way. Worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel baby smooth. The volcanic rock is very exfoliating and you can feel it working while it dries&amp; hardens. I use it when my skin needs a super charge and feel blah.</li>
    <li> With 2 still no obvious sense</li>
    <li> It does the work but considering the price I will not repurchase it.</li>
    <li> another great product!!</li>
    <li> Figured I would purchase after the hype and the price on Amazon was much better than the official website.  It&#x27;s not a bad product, I like the tingling sensation and the smell is not bad at all.  The best part of this mask is when you scrub it off your face, your skin feels really nice, smooth and exfoliated without breaking out.  I put it on at least once a week and it&#x27;s been a good product to use for me and I&#x27;m in my forties with dry breakout-prone skin.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin feeling silky smooth &amp; hydrated!&lt;br /&gt;Loved the tingle! Applies easily , and is a breeze to remove .worth every cent.</li>
    <li> This is a fake product I had it analyzed by Glamglow and they said it was completly fake and the letters on the jar were painted on and were chipping.  Worst part is it is dried up and smells horrible and I am not planning to try this.</li>
    <li> Really great product. My skin looks fantastic. My lines are almost nonexistent and it lasts for several days. I recommend this product and would buy it again</li>
    <li> I put this on when I&#x27;m in the shower and when I wash it off ten minutes later you can feel the difference. My skin is smooth and there is a refreshing tingly feeling. The only downside is the price.</li>
    <li> I recommend everyone use this, you will see a difference , I&#x27;ve been using this brand for a month and my skin has never looked or felt so youthful before ... Heads up, it does sting do don&#x27;t freak out</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF IS CLAY IN A BOTTLE. IT SEEMS TO RIP THROUGH YOUR PORES AND CAUSE BLEMISHES.  WAY OVERPRICED. NO GLAM GLOW HERE.</li>
    <li> The mask does exfoliate and I like the way my skin feels immediately after I take the mask off. However, it really dries out my skin, which is already dry anyway. Obviously, I put on a good moisturizer afterwards, and my skin is fine. I had hoped this mask would leave my skin softer, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> The real deal product - 4 to 5 stars.  The product being sold here, less than that because it seems suspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a large sample of this from Sephora some time ago.  I used it several times and absolutely loved it.  I have dry, sensitive skin skin, but contrary to some of the reviews here, this product did not feel too harsh, nor did the exfoliants feel like they were skin-tearing.  After use, my skin felt so incredibly hydrated, even without the use of a moisturizer (that&#x27;s a rarity for me).  It also felt smooth and silky soft.  It might be true that there are cheaper masks that are just as effective, but to be honest, I&#x27;ve not found a decent mud mask in a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the product being marketed here, at least based on the photos, does not seem authentic.  I have only seen it sold at very specific places, so that alone raises a red flag.  But what I find more disturbing is that when you zoom in on the photos of the product, you can see that it&#x27;s a poor imitation of the actual GlamGlow packaging.  There are errors in the writing - it is not smooth and you can see almost &amp;#34;wavy&amp;#34; lines, almost as though someone colored outside the lines. It&#x27;s a poor stamp. The font and writing simply is not sharp and crisp as it is on the actual jar.  In addition, these photos show a plain black jar, but the authentic product has an almost granite look to it - black with grey or white spots throughout it (at least the one sold on Sephora looks that way).  It&#x27;s entirely possible these are just poor photos, but they make me wary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any event, I would be careful when buying this through a third party seller not authorized by the company to sell its product.  As this is not actually sold by Amazon, I would think this is a buyer beware situation.</li>
    <li> I love using this mask!  It really does make a difference.  I just wish manufacturers would make their print larger!</li>
    <li> very good for home spa . Treat yourself with very good scrub</li>
    <li> I bought this product on a whim during some retail therapy and it wasn&#x27;t one of my best decisions. After reading other reviews I was a little skeptical but I believed the hype had to have some good to it (it is a popular Hollywood product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have chunks of the leaves in it which makes absolutely no sense at all. It&#x27;s a real pain to put on your face when you have to mess around with all the pieces. They really should have ground them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is tingly and feels good while it was on. You can see it changes color (gets lighter) when it dries which is nice so you know you&#x27;ve had it on long enough. I was a little worried about the product ingredients (see other reviews for elaboration since I&#x27;m not proficient at explaining this aspect.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my pores or skin so that was pretty disappointing. The tightening feeling faded very shortly after. I have really sensitive skin so I&#x27;m surprised the product didn&#x27;t irritate my face but that&#x27;s a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t believe this product was worth the money I spent on it at all, and I probably won&#x27;t use it again for a while. Maybe before a date or something important so my face feels fresh, but knowing it really doesn&#x27;t make a physical difference to my face makes me feel like I have a small container of expensive leaves and volcanic rock that cost me more than I&#x27;d like to admit... I probably could go outside and scoop up some mud with leaves and grass and have a similar concoction.</li>
    <li> my skin is sensitive... too hurt to use it!</li>
    <li> I literally got 2 uses out this! Then it dried up and hardened and cannot use. I kept the lid shut tight and stored In a safe place. As for the mask itself I didn&#x27;t see anything special...maybe because I only got to use 2 times!</li>
    <li> Someone in the beauty business gave me the first GlamGlow Mud Mask and I have been hooked.  Beautiful end result and your face will be thanking you.</li>
    <li> Remember that annoying girl in school who thought she was a &#x27;10&#x27; but really was a &#x27;6&#x27;, at best? And no one had the guts to say it to her face because she was so oblivious and self-absorbed? Well similarly, this is a mediocre clay-based mask that is a victim of its own overhyped \\&quot;hollywood glam\\&quot; marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is overpriced for what it is. Glamglow has an aggressive marketing team who hustles like crazy which is why its so (over-)hyped up. They somehow got this product into all W hotels, so you are inclined to purchase it in your hotel room. $25 for a sample-sized jar. Ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening, first thing you notice is the strong scent of artificial green tea. The package promotes green tea in the formula, and yeah, there are bits of leaves in the jar, but then why load it up with a highly fake, non-green-tea-smelling artificial fragrance unless you have something to hide? I grew up drinking green tea. It should NOT smell like sickly sweet Elizabeth Arden Green Tea perfume (which this mask does). Further inspecting the ingredient listing, \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; is listed, which is artificial and not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glamglow totally irritates sensitive skin or delicate skin b/c its loaded with pumice bits and scrubbers (yes, PUMICE &#x3D; the stuff you use to scrub your foot calluses, which Glamglow lovingly calls \\&quot;volcanic rock\\&quot;) that act as an exfoliator once the mask is dry. Upon rinsing, the pumice was so scratchy and i could feel it creating microtears in my acne-prone skin. The mask dries quickly but the clay is embedded with pumice so it&#x27;s impossible to wash off without literally *scouring* your face. (shudder)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, it is loaded with a methyl salicylate or menthol type of tingle. The sensation, if you have sensitive, red, irritated, or acne-prone skin, can be very painful and stinging. i find that masks which add the \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; do so in order to warrant a \\&quot;feeling of action\\&quot; that their product works. If the product really worked to purify and synthesize collagen (seriously --that&#x27;s what they claim), then you wouldn&#x27;t need to add gimmicks to fool people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that, but Glamglow has been spamming the boards on MakeupAlley and other beauty forums. I wrote a post on a *cosmetic procedures* board about enlarged pores and rec&#x27;s for derm treatments--guess what? got spammed with \\&quot;try Glamglow!!\\&quot; post written by an obvious shill.  It was such a promo publicity-laden post that the message was removed by the forum police after multiple complaints. This leaves a bad taste in my mouth and says a LOT about the company.

    <li> It&#x27;s a great product and better than I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive combination skin so it was a little painful but you can really see the difference the next day , plus it washes off really easily unlike some other mud masks...the only down side is the price and the amount of product you get but other than that&#x27;s it&#x27;s amazing</li>
    <li> If I could give this more than 5 stars I would. I can&#x27;t even express how much I love this stuff. It looks like a little amount but you out on such a thin layer it really goes a long way. Buy it. It will change your life.</li>
    <li> Amazing. Your skin looks and feels transformed. Wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> The mask is good. But the one I received has been used .And there is no little spoon in that! This is not the first time the amazon do such thing.</li>
    <li> I am 25 years old and have struggled with cystic pimples since I was about 14.  I have tried everything from drugstore products to prescription medications to eliminating entire food groups from my diet.  Cleaning up my diet certainly helped the most, but I would still struggle with cycstic acne.  I think it is from wearing makeup throughout my workday, then heading to the gym and having a lot of buildup from makeup and sweat.  Since using this mask once a week to purge my pores of dirt and oil buildup, I have not had one pimple.  Not one. I have been using the mask for 3 months right now and this is the longest I have gone in my entire life without having one zit on my face.  I get compliments almost daily on my skin.  I wear less makeup.  My pores have shrunk drastically.  My skin is smoother than it has ever been.  I recommend this product to everyone, and I have gotten over ten ladies hooked on this stuff.  My mom sometimes uses it twice a week she loves it so much.  I have combination/senstive skin and have not had any issues with this mask.  It has only improved my skin.  Love Glam Glow - I will continue to use it for as long as they sell it.</li>
    <li> That&#x60;s amazing！！It can make your face clean and bright！！In my opinion ，it is the best one of masks！！I will buy it again！！</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter. She had never tried it but said she really wanted it because she had read some really great reviews about is on Sephora. When she recieved it from Amazon she tried it and absolutely loved it. She said it was amazing how the results were on her face. I am so grateful she loved it and hope that I will be able to buy more for her from Amazon.</li>
    <li> More like Damn!!! It really works. My skin looked radiant right away. Thanks Glamglow. Now all I need is the hollywood $:)!</li>
    <li> When I received this mask, the container was not well sealed, so top of the mask was kind of dry, which made me unhappy of course. WHO wants to have a partly-dried mask? especially when it is not cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face felt itchy in the first several minutes when I use it, the smell is fresh, and no big differences I saw after using it. SO, I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> take off my black head, and minimize the pores  that is real cool!!! good product .  and is nuture.good good</li>
    <li> I bought this product after glowing reviews-pardon the pun- from multiple sources, hoping it would make my face look brighter and fresher. Immediately following the mask my face looks and feels better, but after a few hours, I&#x27;m back to normal.  Ultimately, this product is comparable to a lot of other mud masks and I won&#x27;t be spending the money on this product again. It&#x27;s not that great for the cost.</li>
    <li> Glam Glow is an amazing product!  Having turned 53 in March, I was noticing more lines and wrinkles and a dullness to my complexion...not to mention the enlarged pores.  After one application, I noticed a difference in the texture and appearance.  Love it and recommend it to everyone!  Well worth the money...cheaper than botox and better for you!&lt;br /&gt;On top of that I received the product in two days!  Great service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Glam Glow!</li>
    <li> My favorite mask.  Such a good deal on Amazon. My skin always looks and feels great after using this.  I love the tightening it gives my face.</li>
    <li> I use this product once a week on average and I can tell the difference in my skin! It is worth the price!</li>
    <li> I read a newspaper article where the reviewer&#x27;s spouse had used this and he raved about it. So I bought it, in hopes that my man would let me give him a revitalizing &#x27;pick me up&#x27;.  No go.... so I&#x27;ve been using it - it smells pleasant and I like the exfoliating results. It does make the skin feel softer &amp; brighter, but I&#x27;m not so sure it lasts a full 3 days as advertised.  It&#x27;s definitely nice to use just hours before an event for a dewier look, but be sure to try it a few days prior to ensure you don&#x27;t have any adverse reaction.</li>
    <li> I use this product every Saturday morning and can still feel the silky, smooth finish on my face the entire week. I do not feel any tingle, but after rinsing it off, my skin looks and feels amazing. I does tend to dry out a little in the jar, so I just moisten my fingers before I scoop out the product. The tea leaves are a little messy,  and some fall into the sink when applying, but the end results are so great that this is just a FYI and not a complaint. I also love that it never leaves my face red or irritated, as other products sometimes do, and that I actually have a healthy, natural glow all weekend long. I definitely recommend this product--after one five-minute application, you&#x27;ll be hooked.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product for immediate results but I haven&#x27;t noticed any lasting changes. It does burn a little at first but not too bad. Overall, not worth the high price</li>
    <li> I was expecting the glam glow to get rid of my blackheads and clean my pores. It wasn&#x27;t very effective. The smell and texture is very nice though.</li>
    <li> This stuff burns a little, but it makes your face feel great. The burn isnt bad enough to not use it and your face looks instantly better.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the real deal. It will make your skin look smoother and feel tighter. It goes on thick and dries sucking out all of the impurities on your skin when you rinse it.</li>
    <li> I received a jar of this to try out.  It comes in an over-the-top box with two product inserts - just a bit much.  Kind of a let down when you see this box that is the size of most 3.3 oz perfume bottles only to find a tiny jar inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the product itself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all this mask has tea leaf bits that get everywhere.  Now maybe it is just me thinking here but if it is such a vital ingredient - wouldn&#x27;t you - oh, I don&#x27;t know - blend it up so it goes ALL OVER the face and not just in blotches???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there are the tiny lava rocks that are really jagged.  I really had to lighten my touch applying this - you can feel it tearing at your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product states it \\&quot;tingles\\&quot; - what I experienced was BURNING.  And, no, I do not have sensitive skin - thank goodness for that!  The burning subsided after about 3 to 5 minutes but never felt good.  After my 10 minutes was over I had to remove this from my face without removing the skin from my face.  They want you - not joking here - to use circular motions while removing.  That would not be bad - UNLESS you missed the part about the jagged rocks!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My muslin cloth got roughed up from this - not exaggerating about how jagged the lava is.  I did find the smell plesant enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made the comment that this felt like foot scrub on my face.  So, for S&amp;G&#x27;s I actually put it on the soles of my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the BEST FOOT SCRUB EVER!!!  I had some hard areas on my feet.  Nothing so horrible I needed to pull out some freaking crazy blade tool - just rough.  After using this they are like butter!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are much kinder, less expensive and better products for your face.  If you want a great pre-pedi foot mask - this stuff is just the ticket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GlamGlow should ditch the large box, blend the leaves, stick this goop in a tube and repackage this as a foot scub.  They would make millions that way!!!</li>
    <li> Everyone had been saying that i need to try GlamGlow so i finally purchased it and i really wished I had done so sooner. Works wonders, I saw a noticeable difference in less than a week.</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my skin look but I&#x27;m scared to put it on because my face burns until it goes numb.</li>
    <li> I use this mask as my emergency rescue solution only because however short lived, the results are instant, yet this thing is so tiny and expensive.  I have yet found other products that give me similar results.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how much is psychosomatic, and how much is that this stuff does what it is supposed to, but I love it. I normally get really bad acne around &amp;#34;that time of the month&amp;#34;, but using this the couple of weeks ahead of that drastically reduced my breakouts. I also feel that my face looks cleaner, definitely feels softer, and makeup goes on smoother. It is worth the money for the pampering that I feel I deserve...and how good I feel I look!</li>
    <li> Great product. Been using for a couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was curious why it is so much cheaper.  Then it came in and I got my answer.  The seal was broken and it looks like someone refilled the jar with a bunch of samples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not happy but not dealing with a return right now.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!!! I purchase some items at sephora and they gave me a sample of this product. Yesterday I was going to a big party and I decided to try it on to see what was it all about. I put it on and the first min was really tingling!!! I thought if that feeling was gonna be for the full 10 min I wasn&#x27;t gonna be able to leave it on, but it disappeared fast. When I wash it out I couldn&#x27;t believe how alive,bright and hydrated my skin looked!!!! Like magic!!!!! I live in Seattle so right now is really dry, I use in my skin expensive good products that work for me, but this one is SPECiAL!!! I will continue buying this product for a loooong time.&lt;br /&gt;I had just purchase it from amazon because it is cheaper than in sephora.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about ordering this because of the price, but after my first time using it I was hooked. Does it tingle? Yes. Does it burn a little bit? Yes. Does it make a noticeable difference after the first time you use it? Absolutely. If you have sensitive skin try using a little water with a small amount of the product and work your way up to using more product. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the mask. It is powerful to clean my oil skin area, especially the T- shaped area (forehead, nose and jaw) . I expect the price discount and want to buy more.</li>
    <li> Not what I was looking for as an organic volcanic rock clay infused product... After researching and so many synthetic fake things in it, they should spend all of the advertising making a quality product instead</li>
    <li> just don&#x27;t like glamglow any more</li>
    <li> This a very good mask for exfoliation.  It does make the skin glow afterward, as doees any good exfoliation.  Make sure you rinse well, and use an older or dark towel, since it can be a bit messy removing it.  I also found that a final rinse with nice cool water make my skin feel great.</li>
    <li> As far as a mask and exfoliator, this product is great, even exceptional. It definitely tingles and feels like it&#x27;s working. But as far as delivering the results of a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; after you use it? Nah, not really. I didn&#x27;t notice my skin glowed at all, except for the feeling of just having been exfoliated. I like the product, but it&#x27;s not really a value because of the price. Seller was great though.</li>
    <li> best cleaning mask I have ever used, i can see my face glowing after I use it. Cleans pore very well.</li>
    <li> This Glam glow exfoliating mud mask works amazingly! I got it for my wife and she loves it! it makes her skin so soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Great product, noticed results after first use.  This product definitely does what it says.  My skin looks and feels amazing along with pore reduction.  For the first time in many years I feel confident to leave the house without or very little make up!</li>
    <li> Product did not work as well as the other reviews led me to believe. wont purchase again but was happy to try it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s for my friend. I didn&#x27;t use it yet, but shipment was nice. It&#x27;s a good goods. try 2 it</li>
    <li> Leaves skin soft and feeling moisturized albeit a bit messy.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mask. I use this mask weekly and it leaves my skin glowing, soft and feeling super clean. I love glamglow!</li>
    <li> Love this product and I noticed results immediately. I have extremely oily skin and this just sucks the oil and blackheads right out. I had many tiny pimples on my forehead and they are virtually all gone (happened after 1-2 uses!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely a strong tingling sensation but you get used to it, and personally it makes my face feel so fresh and clean with the tingle and exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase again - worth EVERY penny.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I found this product through Pinterest and was hooked! I went to Sephora and they were all out except for the travel size! Next I check amazon and not only is it available, it is less expensive! Amazing product and I will be ordering this product  again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used masques for decades as part of my beauty regimen.  It could be one of the reasons I&#x27;m told I look 20 years younger than my chronological age and get compliments on my complexion all the time.  Until recently I used the Lancome masque until my niece introduced me to Glam Glow.  She was right -- it&#x27;s fantastic.  With steady use (as with all masques, 2x per week is optimal)  your skin texture, clarity, and even firmness keep improving.  I thought my skin could not look any better than it already did -- but it does!!  Have been using it for about 5 months and am only on my second jar.  It&#x27;s the real deal, delivering all that it promises - a rarity in cosmetics.</li>
