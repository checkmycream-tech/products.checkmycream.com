<li> i found it smelled nothing like sandalwood and was an unpleasant and strong scent  </li>
<li> During the holiday season I found this spray with a small shower gel, when I looked for it later I could not find it anywhere.  </li>

    <li> i bought this as a body spray for the sandalwood fragrance. i found it smelled nothing like sandalwood and was an unpleasant and strong scent  i&#x27;m gonna give Eclectic Lady another try and chalk this up as a $9 dollar mistake. I can&#x27;t even think of anyone I&#x27;d give it away to, it&#x27;s so unpleasant.</li>
    <li> My new favorite body spray!! looooove it!</li>
    <li> My husband had been a huge AXE body spray fan for years. I loved the convenience of the product. Twist the top, spray, twist it back to close and throw it in the gym bag. But for me, I always had to take my pump body spray and hope it wouldn&#x27;t get crushed. Now AXE has body sprays for her? WaHoo! One less thing to worry about. Not only do I have the ability to just throw it in a bag and not worry about it, but the scent is fantastic. It has a bit of a strong scent right as first, but it quickly goes to a soft/perfect scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering at all. Love this body spray.</li>
