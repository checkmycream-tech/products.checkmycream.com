<li> I find this product to be a bit heavy going on probably because of the sun screen</li>
<li> Any SPF I use on my face usually bothers my eyes.</li>
<li> I use it everyday!</li>
<li> so there are very few moisturizers I can use with an SPF that will not make me break.</li>
<li> Not good</li>

    <li> I am using image products for 5 years and it is always high quality product.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite facial sunscreen. I have oily skin and usually sunscreen looks really oily on my skin, or glows white from the titanium dioxide. This stuff, however, is great. It goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t make me look oilier, and isn&#x27;t white unless I make the mistake of putting it on my skin while it&#x27;s still wet. The smell is great too -- kind of like Fruit Stripe gum.</li>
    <li> yes I use this all the time its great</li>
    <li> Awesome moisturizer has kept my skin hydrated when dry and balanced when oily. During this pregnancy thanks to this products my skin still looks great.</li>
    <li> The best moisturizer ever keeps my makeup looking great all day</li>
    <li> The wife loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> I would order it again.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product at the spa connected to my dermatologist&#x27;s office. It has a mild, lovely scent, that is soothing to the senses.  It feels a little greasy when you put it on, but soaks in quite well.  I put it on after my shower in the morning and wait a while before I put on my makeup.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin so there are very few moisturizers I can use with an SPF that will not make me break. I&#x27;ve only use this cream for few days, but so far I like it. It absorbs very well, leaves a soft/non greasy feeling, and of course it has a high SPF.  Also love the smell, it&#x27;s a sweet bubble gum smell. Very pleasant in both feel and smell.</li>
    <li> Greasy. not matte like it says.</li>
    <li> Any SPF I use on my face usually bothers my eyes. This one, however, does not. It is light and does not cause breakouts. I recommend it for SPF use specifically.</li>
    <li> I am never going back to any other moisturizer with SPF again.  This is the best I&#x27;ve found yet!  It absorbs oil very well and has a nice texture.  It does not go on thick like some and has a lovely fresh scent, hard to tell exactly what the scent is, maybe citrus, cucumber and a little banana?</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this lotion at a local spa years ago.  It has nice mattifying properties and the sunscreen component isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy.  Perfect light lotion for outdoor summer months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a sunscreen moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make me sticky since forever.  Hawaii is very humid and every other moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried  that has sunscreen has made my face feel sticky, and it stays like that ALL DAY.  the Image Matte Moisturizer goes on thick, but smooth and NOT STICKY AT ALL!  it&#x27;s everything I&#x27;ve been looking for!  I love it!  I use it everyday!</li>
    <li> Best face sunblock. Does not cause breakouts. Love it!!</li>
    <li> A nice consistency that gives me confidence there is a sunscreen layer on my skin.</li>
    <li> Love the matte moisturization, keeps me from getting too shiny. Love. Image products, they work great for my skin type. I have oily and some normal skin as I&#x27;m aging so these products work great to keep me moisturized and give my skin a youthful glow.</li>
    <li> Made my face look super white. Wasnt happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product with no heavy feeling. Leaves skin smooth and not shiny.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. It was recommended by my Dermatologist for me to use. It really blocks the sun and provides a great base before applying foundation. I have been purchasing it through amazon because the prices are way better than the Dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin on my face and could not wear it in that area but I used it as a sunscreen for the rest of my body.  Good coverage, not greasy  and I did not burn which is important!</li>
    <li> I have roseaca and this moisturizer works and feels great on my skirt n.</li>
    <li> Love this.  Use it daily and especially when out on the boat scuba diving.  Doesn&#x27;t hurt the eyes.</li>
    <li> This product is FABULOUS.  Feels good going on and so good for my skin.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best lotion I have used yet- I used to not use lotion because I would get oily. Not good I know- then I started switching up my foundation and lotion to figure out the problem. I&#x27;ve tried $5 lotion to $50 lotion- and finally found this gem!!! Obsessed and love the matte.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping!  Item was exactly as described!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer absorbs quickly and leaves no shine behind!</li>
    <li> Love this!! I usually have to be very careful using an SPF because I have very sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t break my face out at all love it!!</li>
    <li> Love love love. This moisturizer is ultra hydrating without leaving my oily skin looking greasy. I recommend to everyone. Especially if you have oily skin like me. I used to have to constantly apply powder on my t-zone area throughout the day. I recognized that with this product my t-zone is not as shinny as it used to be and I actually don&#x27;t even use powder to get rid of the shinny t-zone area anymore. My face just looks glowy. Oh and did I mention the product smells like bananas. Yum!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for sunscreen for years that would give me a matte finish because my skin is so oily.  I use sunscreen all the time and my I have to use oil blotters throughout the day...ugg!  With this sunscreen I don&#x27;t have to use the blotters any more!!  This is also a great moisturizer under makeup.  I will ordering for myself and my teenage daughter as well.  BEST sunscreen/moisturizer out there!!!  (smells good too!)</li>
    <li> Great product!  Keeps my face from being too oily during the day.  I love Image products!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t feel greasy but my skin was still dry and flakey afterwards.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a lotion like this forever. Sun protection, lightweight under makeup, keeps from getting shiny all day...love it! I will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this moisturizer several times.  It is not greasy or heavy and it does give good sun protection.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Hands down my most favorite daily moisturizer.  Keeps me looking healthy, not shiny.  Glowy, not sweaty.  Perfect for year round daily use.</li>
    <li> Feels nice on my skin. Smells great, too. Not sure it has much SPF factor, but good for daily use. No pimples like other sunscreens.</li>
    <li> I love Image products - especially this moisturizer/sunscreen.  It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> I have used Image products for 2 years and like them but had not tried this moisturizer.  I find this product to be a bit heavy going on probably because of the sun screen but what I really dislike is the strong, sweet fragrance.  Because it&#x27;s on your face, you smell it while applying it and while it&#x27;s drying.  I dropped it down a star because of that.  I will probably finish this tube but would not buy again nor would I recommend it.</li>
