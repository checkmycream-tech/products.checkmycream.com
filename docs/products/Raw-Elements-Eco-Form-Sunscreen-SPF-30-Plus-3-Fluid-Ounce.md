      <li>But the benefits of using no chemical made me think I got a good sunscreen until I got sunburn twice.  </li>
      <li>good sunscreen.  </li>

      <li>/&gt;Effectiveness: I didn&#x27;t get burned anywhere where I applied the sunscreen (I did get burned where I missed a spot, but that&#x27;s my own fault.)</li>
      <li>/&gt;Probably people with oily skin should be sure to remove the screen off with a good astringent when they go inside.  </li>

      <li>I am very fair so it doesn&#x27;t show up so much on my skin, but on my husband it looks ghostly.</li>
      <li>was able to use this product immediately, and without any kind of reaction.</li>
      <li>As it is the best product I have found so far I will continue to use it on my face and just deal with the break-outs.</li>
      <li>This is a great safe sunscreen for my family that work very well!!</li>
      <li>I love that the ingredients are so natural, and its ingredients list are one of the best I&#x27;ve seen.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t rub very smoothly.</li>
      <li>I am a sunscreen junkie (super fair skin)</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also made in the USA. :)</li>
      <li>and I like that much better.</li>
      <li>I love to be in the garden.  </li>
      <li>Love this sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Overall, I am happy and will probably order this again!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this sunscreen twice but I love it. I have dry skin and I use oils and strong moisturizers all the time, so I love that this is very moisturizing. Someone with oily skin might not like it. I thought it might leave a strong white cast on my skin (which I didn&#x27;t even care if it did) but it didn&#x27;t, I feel it does make my skin appear slightly lighter but in a nice brightening way.  But it might look whiter on darker skin tones, I&#x27;m pale olive.  Also I love love the ingredients, I looked forever to find a good organic sunscreen and I&#x27;m so glad I finally found this one!</li>
    <li> I have very pale skin (born in Ireland, so go figure) but I try to avoid the chemical-filled sunscreens. The texture of this sunscreen is nice - smooth and feels moisturising rather than greasy. The ingredients are good. I haven&#x27;t been sunburned while wearing this sunscreen for walking (in very sunny New Mexico). I have yet to wear the sunscreen at the beach (to observe how it works in water), but so far so good.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing product! I am a sunscreen junkie (super fair skin) and this is THE product if you want long lasting coverage for swimming or being outside, especially if you are sweating a lot. It covers thick and stays on for hours and hours. After swimming and bike riding I can still see sunscreen on my skin and have zero redness at the end of the day. I usually put it on once and it lasts and lasts. It smells terrific too and even my kids will let me slather it on. I can see why surfers would love this product. I will buy again and again!</li>
    <li> I teach middle school physical education and so need a great sunscreen.  I am impressed thus far with the Raw Elements.  I have sensitive skin and have not had any issue using this.  It was a little oily at first but I think that was because it needed to mix together.  Overall, I am happy and will probably order this again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit thick and my toddler gets impatient when I rub it in but I love knowing that I&#x27;m using a better product and with the Texas sun we are using a lot of it!</li>
    <li> I concur with the users who say that the product is way too difficult to get out of the tube.  You end up getting a workout just getting enough to cover your legs and then another workout trying to rub it in.  I gave it two stars because I do like the ingredients list, being unable to use any of the \\&quot;benzone family\\&quot; ingredients, and as I didn&#x27;t get burned I assume the product works.  Still, I think I&#x27;ll give this one a pass next time and try another product.</li>
    <li> This lotion is a lot thicker than most.  It is a bit difficult to spread on skin, however I did see it on the approved list of effective sunblocks.</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells a bit like olives, definitely greasey but I didn&#x27;t care because it&#x27;s expected from all sunscreens. No burns AT ALL even after being in the hot sun for 7hrs in Mexico- and even after swimming with the stingrays! Expensive but there&#x27;s no need to over use the product. Shows up white and stays white; on pale Caucasian skin and brown skin- no shame though. I searched for many hours and a couple days for the best biodegradable sunscreen and I am very happy and satisfied with my pick! :)</li>
    <li> Very good protection and good to know its safe to use.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful sunscreen. I love that all the ingredients are safe!  It has a slight scent, but it is well worth it. Feels thick when it comes out of the tube, but once applied and it sits for 5 minutes, it feels amazing and looks clear.  A little goes a long way. Best $ I have spent on a sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Well the only reason I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars is because the product listed is not what I received. I order the actual sunscreen as listed and I got the Eco stick for face instead. That&#x27;s annoying. Now I have to order it again so that I can have sunscreen for my body.</li>
    <li> OK so it goes on like paste.  You really need to rub it in.  It takes quite awhile to do your whole body.  It  also takes some scrubbing in the shower to get it all off.  However, it works!!!! Meaning no sunburn and no rash.  We used both this and Badger for a week in the Bahamas sun and it worked great!  So not cheap, not quick to apply but it&#x27;s not full of chemicals and it works.</li>
    <li> I purchased both this and Aubrey Cosmetics&#x27; \\&quot;SPF 30+/Active Lifestyles\\&quot; sunscreens simultaneously after consulting the EWG website.  I used Raw Elements first, but had a really hard time getting it out of the bottle: even after mushing it around inside of the tube to try and \\&quot;loosen\\&quot; it up, I actually had to unscrew the cap, put pressure on the crimp of the tube, and push it out.  It&#x27;s super thick, goes on quite white, and still shows when you rub it in (I had very prominent white build-up by the creases of my arms).  As other reviewers said, it has a greasy feel (so do many more natural sunscreens).  But y&#x27;know what?  I didn&#x27;t get burned after being in the sun and sweating for a few hours.  I DID get burned each time I used the Aubrey.  So, the Aubrey&#x27;s out and the Raw is in. As a melanoma survivor, I just can&#x27;t mess around with getting sunburns.</li>
    <li> good sunscreen.  stays on.  blocks burn. is thick and leaves whitish glow, but we don&#x27;t mind that because we are in the water a lot.  if you don&#x27;t like the white haze, find another sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen for my toddler!</li>
    <li> My favorite sunscreen.  It keeps me protected even while surfing and out in the water for over two hours.  Great product and environmentally friendly, it has been hard to find something that works.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this sunscreen ... Knowing I&#x27;m rubbing a safe, chemical free product into my family&#x27;s skin AND it&#x27;s powerful enough to protect us all from harmful rays that cause damage inside and out, brings me peace &amp; joy! I&#x27;m ready to order another tube, and I have to tell you, the price justifies the benefit! This weekend we spent the day at the Jersey shore in the prime sun ~ 10am to 2pm. I reapplied once to my youngest and myself, as we have fair skin, but my husband only applied once before we left the house at 9am. The only burn ... The legs of my poor son that I forgot about :( * A little goes a long way * There is a slight white haze, but it&#x27;s rubbed in easily enough * Yes, it&#x27;s definitely kinda greasy, but I think that&#x27;s a small inconvenience.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen does NOT cause breakouts. I have very sensitive, acne-prone skin. I used to apply Neutrogena baby sunscreen that caused many breakouts before, but this one is perfect. It also contains all-natural, organic ingredients. If it seems too oily, use Mario Badescu Special Healing Powder (0.5 oz) to cover it up.</li>
    <li> Actually too greasy to test! I put some on just my neck area to start out as a test area and wasn&#x27;t impressed. Not matter how much I rubbed it in it was still tremendously greasy. Maybe that&#x27;s how organic sunblocks are, but it was so greasy it was uncomfortable. I only had it on a couple hours and I didn&#x27;t get burned on my neck after being outside for that long but I don&#x27;t consider it a true test of the product. I probably won&#x27;t purchase it again simply for the grease factor :/ I appreciate that it&#x27;s all organic but I need something that doesn&#x27;t make me look like I just came out of a deep fryer and this product isn&#x27;t it!</li>
    <li> Non GMO Sunscreen, YES PLEASE! I seriously love this stuff, I did so much research trying to find a good non gmo sunscreen that had low impacts to health and the environment. I have two young boys who have sensitive skin and this stuff is amazing, no issues at all with it and knowing it is safe for me and my kids is just wonderful. I have one bottle in my house, a stick in my purse and a bottle on the boat. It is the only sunscreen I will use for my kids and me. And it totally works, some other natural or homemade sunscreen didn&#x27;t work, especially on my light skinned, blue eyed, bleach blond 2 year...who burns easily from even 15 minutes of exposure to the sun. So after one of the natural sunscreens left him with red arms, I vowed to find the best sunscreen and I did with this one. So happy with this, and it spreads on so easily compared to other natural sunscreens and doesn&#x27;t leave you with a white film all over.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I got a bad batch. This lotion stank, I cannot wear something that reeks so badly. It was also very thick so it was hard to squeeze out of the tube, however once I rubbed it between my palms it would become more spreadable...still not easy to spread.</li>
    <li> I purchased this sunscreen but was a bit disappointed. I haven&#x27;t been out in a burning hot sun, so I don&#x27;t know how well it works, although I trust other testimonials. However, the product won&#x27;t come out of the tube easily. The consistency is not even and little cluttery things in it-similar to badger product but if badger product ooze oil out this one does not. It goes away when you apply it but sunscreen doesn&#x27;t spread as well like other lotion or sunscreen. It&#x27;s slightly yellow due to beeswax, but smells like sunflower seed or whatever. Can&#x27;t use on face because you will break out. Although, if I&#x27;m going to a beach, I&#x27;d rather have acne than burn and get wrinkles in the future. I think I may use shiseido&#x27;s water resistant ultmiate sunscreen for face (ZnO 13% and TiO )if I go to the beach. That product is not as eco-friendly or organic, but provides better UVB protection, and similarly high UVA protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I need to wear raw element or any  kind of water resistant sunscreen for daily use. So I store it for certain occasions. It has fairly long expiration date-2 years- so I&#x27;m happy with that.</li>
    <li> Works great. I feel confident that my son is well protected since it is non GMO certified. It smells good, protects well from the sun and is just great. It kept our son from burning on vacation at 6 months old after spending an hour at a time in the pool.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the sunscreen.  I like that it&#x27;s organic and is rated highly by EWG.  It works well and doesn&#x27;t leave you looking white.  It actually makes your skin glisten.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it, since it&#x27;s pretty thick.  I used it on my face as well, without breaking out or causing irritation.  It has a pleasant smell, like sunflower seeds.</li>
    <li> I like Raw Sunscreen because they use natural ingredients. Yes, it was hard to squeeze, it makes you look white, and it expensive. But the benefits of using no chemical made me think I got a good sunscreen until I got sunburn twice.  The first time I applied it all over except my face, and that was the only place I didn&#x27;t have sunburn.  The second (and last time) I used it all over and had sunburn everywhere.  I put this on my kids and they got sunburns, too. My husband used typical chemical sunscreen and did not get any sunburns. Both times I used this sunscreen at swimming pool.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff.  No unpronounceable ingredients.  Another reviewer didn&#x27;t like smell, but it&#x27;s kinda earthy, ok by me.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that the only reason Raw Elements did not receive 5 stars is because it is too greasy for people with acne-prone skin. The product does make my skin break out. I would really love to find a sunblock that is both non-nano and oil-free. As it is the best product I have found so far I will continue to use it on my face and just deal with the break-outs. I will definitely continue to use it to protect my body.  I bought the stick. I had never used a stick before so it was difficult to apply at first. But now that I am used to it I know how to roll it on. Oddly enough it feels a little dry when I am applying it (even though it has oil in it). Coverage is really good. I only get a slight white tint which doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I expect that from a product with high zinc oxide content. I can feel the oil on my face, though it isn&#x27;t heavy. I haven&#x27;t got any spots on my clothing, so it seems to be non-staining. I would like to try the tube to see if the consistency or oil content is any different.  I was surprised how small the stick is, though it is perfect size for carrying in a pocket or bag. I can&#x27;t say how long the stick will last with daily use. I use hat and sunglasses in Florida and would never rely on just sunblock year round. That said, it is \\&quot;winter\\&quot; here now and I have been out with just the Raw Elements on my face and hands in the sun and I haven&#x27;t had any hyper-pigmentation or redness on my very light skin tone (which burns easily).  I love outdoor sports and Raw Elements is sweat resistant. It does not sting my eyes. I haven&#x27;t tried it swimming yet so will have to report back on water resistance. It does float, so that is a great selling point for people who like to be in the water and carry their sunscreen with them for reapplication.  Overall Raw Elements is a great product that I recommend. I would just caution people prone to break-outs that it does have oil in it.</li>
    <li> Good coverage for the price. A little hard to rub in. Good for sensitive skin or those wanting less chemicals.</li>
    <li> This product separates very badly and stained my beach clothes with the oil that spilt from the separation and heat. Very opaque, white and tough to drag onto your skin. I have 1 from just months ago with an expiration date through 2013 that is already bad and a waste of money. Try elemental herbs sunscreen it is clean, rubs in CLEAR and is a much better value!</li>
    <li> We really like the protection but my daughter hates it when we put it on here because it is a little too thick to put on. We have to rub it a little after applying it or else her skin looks all white. :) Besides that it protects very well.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about this sunscreen, but I am happy to say it did the job!  I was outdoors all day at a baseball game, and did not get the slightest bit red.  The sunscreen is very white, and requires time to rub in, but that is definitely worth it to avoid the toxic chemicals in other sunscreens.  Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research to find a product that did not have all the bad ingredients that are said to cause cancer and this one got good ratings. The smell is okay but the consistency is so thick. It is tough to spread on your skin and even harder to get off. If you have a little scruff on your face and put this on you will have a white face for a long time. Sunscreens aren&#x27;t supposed to last more than a season or so but this ones starts to separate rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;This is a very thick cream and so you don&#x27;t want to use very much of it, but if you don&#x27;t put it on thick enough it isn&#x27;t as effective. So what do you do, guess it is a fine line.&lt;br /&gt;I will use this until I find a better product that spreads easier.</li>
    <li> This product was a good one for having so much zinc oxide in it.  It went on pretty smoothly.  However, I tried it 3 times and every time I went out onto the tennis court, I was besieged with gnats.  That&#x27;s never happened before and the sunscreen was the only thing I changed.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> This works well, however it is too thick and white.  There are other clear versions of zinc oxide out there that I am going to next.  This was kind of like putting toothpaste on your body</li>
    <li> This is very thick like most zinc oxide products and does not blend easily into the skin. I am very fair so it doesn&#x27;t show up so much on my skin, but on my husband it looks ghostly. We may try a tinted product to see if that works any better. Oh, it definitely stays on! It actually takes a bit of effort to wash it off at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> Nice natural sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t make my face white and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. Great coverage and perfect when you are going to be in the water.</li>
    <li> Like this sunscreen for my son. Pretty thick but I was more worried about using a natural product so I don&#x27;t care. Slightly small container for the price though and the bottle came like it was used. Seal was not broken however so it&#x27;s never been opened.</li>
    <li> Works fairly well but my kids think it smells like food. haha</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is extremely thick. You have to spend a lot of time rubbing it in to feel as though you&#x27;ve covered everything, and even then it still leaves a white residue. I used it on a boat trip last summer and I reapplied it multiple times throughout the day and right away after swimming. Even with diligent reapplication, both my husband and I were slightly pink by the end of the day. We are both very white and prone to sunburn, but I&#x27;ve used other products (especially the chemical based ones) that have protected me better than this. I guess I&#x27;ll have to continue my search for a good physical sunscreen for this summer.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen! I work 4x a week for 12 hours in the hot sun of Key West, taking people snorkeling and sailing on a sailboat. I love that this product is reef-safe (seeing as how we snorkel at a coral reef) and that I recognize every ingredient - no chemicals! I slather this on 2-3x a day while out on the water and it does the trick. I&#x27;ve always broken out from sunscreens, but never from Raw Elements. I have both the stick and the paste. Usually, I use the stick on my face and the paste on my body. Yes, it&#x27;s a little white, but I really don&#x27;t care since it works so well. Thank you for making this great product!</li>
    <li> Most good sunscreens are so hard to rub in and your face and body gets this ghostly whiteness. This product is easy to rub in and the white color disappears. I can recommend this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a summer camp counselor for a marine science camp, and I use this daily when we&#x27;re out fishing, boating, snorkeling, etc.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on kind of thick, but stays on for a long time. I&#x27;ve yet to get burned wearing this, despite long hour in the St. Pete sun (highest averagte UV rating in the country). The $10 price is the best I&#x27;ve seen for this brand and competing ones.</li>
    <li> Just diagnosed with pre cancerous skin lesion, and this was recommended. I love it! Seems to stay on longer, love the smell - which some have complained about. Happy that it has more organic ingredients and none of the chemicals that seem to be defeating the whole purpose. I highly recommend this Sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This is one of few physical sunscreens that actually works! It&#x27;s also the real, serious deal when it comes to being water resistant The downside is that it&#x27;s very greasy, white, rubs off easily and smells a bit weird but minus the smell, this is par for course with a non-nano/micronized, high zinc oxide sunscreen. There are pros and cons to everything. It does not go near my face but I use it on my body. I mix it with a bit of a micronized physical sunscreen so it doesn&#x27;t rub off as easily.</li>
    <li> very difficult to squeeze out of the container and I even made the whole bigger.. Anyone with arthritis in the hand would have a problem!  very thick to try to spread on the body without looking like a white ghost. I ended up putting coconut oil on my skin first and then rubbed on the Raw Elements on top  of it. This  helped spread the sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product a few times, but it is exactly as I expected after reading other reviews.  Yes, it does leave a slight &amp;#34;milky&amp;#34; look to the skin which goes away after a time.  I used it for protection for a day of working in a very sunny, bright greenhouse.  I reapplied once during the day and had not even a slight pinkness at the end of the day.  It even seemed to &amp;#34;comfort&amp;#34; a patch of eczema.  Although pricey, I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product, but difficut to spread.</li>
    <li> My sister uses this product on her kids and after trying it and liking it I ordered it  I use it on my face primarily because I have melasma and so far I&#x27;m pleased with it. I need complete protection and this product is good.</li>
    <li> I found this easier than other natural sunblocks, goes on thick like other brands but spreads easier. I gave it a 4 because I had a hard time washing it off in the tub, but I guess that works well for waterproof protection.</li>
    <li> The Raw Elements Eco Form Sunscreen was exactly what I was looking for, a strong sunscreen that was safe to use everyday. Yes, it is very thick to put on and wash off but I was expecting that with any high SPF sunscreen. I have light to medium skin and my arms have darkened due to daily sun exposure. Until I located this product, I was worried I may get skin cancer on my arms from so much sun exposure and also concerned about putting on sunscreen every day. I put on Raw Elements sunscreen around 7am, and it leaves a gently visible white haze which remains visible all day. I don&#x27;t mind the white haze, it&#x27;s actually reassuring knowing 10 hours later I can still see the sunscreen doing its job and remaining on top of my skin and not absorbing into it.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for someone with daily direct sun exposure. For the person that only ventures in the sun a few times a year, I would recommend a lighter product that is easier to put on and take off. Oh, and I would not put this on my face, way too thick.</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen. When my kids come out of the water, the water beads up which tells me that it is very waterproof. Very creamy application.</li>
    <li> At last.... a sunscreen that really does not leak into my eyes!  I love to be in the garden.  Weeding, cutting back, you name it.  But when it gets hot and I am kneeling and leaning over to weed I perspire. Inevitably sunscreen leaks into my eyes.  Holy Mackerel&lt;br /&gt;that hurts!  And it takes a long time to let up.  This sunscreen rocks!  No more painful stinging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably people with oily skin should be sure to remove the screen off with a good astringent when they go inside.  Perhaps, for some, it won&#x27;t work out.  It is thick and difficult to spread so I use it on my face and another product elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I like it. Works on my kid. It&#x27;s a lil sticky but WHO CARES, it&#x27;s NON-GMO, and chemical FREE. Would you rather put toxins on your kids skin?? Great product.. and it&#x27;s lasting me the whole summer.</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen for use in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, near the Great Maya Reef. It is biodegradable and uses zinc oxide instead of chemicals, so it is safe for use near the reef. I did a bit of research before buying this particular brand. It rubs in pretty well and doesn&#x27;t leave white streaks on your skin (although you need to rub it in A LOT). It stays on for a long time. I didn&#x27;t feel the need to re-apply during my 4-hour snorkeling tour. The bottle is pretty small, but it lasted through two applications for two people, and there is still some left. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Used this everyday for the past 4 days at the beach on our Caribbean vaca.  Where I am the sun is rediculous and all I can say is REAPPLY AS DIRECTED!  I was really vigilant with my application and re application on my toddler and my two older kids who were in and out of the sea and pool and they got no burns even after 3 hours a day in the blazing sun on the beach.  I was less so with my own skin and the burns I got are horrible.  So yes...it works as long as you use it properly.  I was in the water for a longer time than the kids who wanted to play in the sand a lot so even though they were always in sun I got the worst burns.  Mine washed off and I was slow to reapply.  Mistake.  I am in so much pain.  At least now I know. Goes on white and rubs in well.  You need to apply it properly.  I wish this was cheaper.</li>
    <li> It stinks and it&#x27;s hard to put it on.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of sun block and have found that Raw Elements us truly the best. A little goes a long way and really does a fantastic job of protecting my families skin. We all tan easily and I find this helps to not let us get too much sun. And my husband burns...and with this he doesn&#x27;t! I also love the face stick!</li>
    <li> I liked that it&#x27;s thicker and not runny. Goes on smooth and blends in well. The smell is neutral. Great coverage and great in the water. You can see the water repel on your skin. From some one that has tried a lot of natural sunscreens. This one is top on my list.</li>
    <li> great that it has organic ingredients and will not harm sea life and corals.  But it is difficult to spread on your body.  Best to lightly coat yourself with some olive oil or almond oil than then dot this heavy cream out, before spreading.</li>
    <li> Great shipping and handling! Received on time. The sunscreen was not my favorite it was difficult to put on my 5 &amp; 7 year old. We used it on vacation in the Caribbean and my kids still got too much sun. Their snorkel goggles were scraping it off of their faces so we had to switch to a higher SPF. I&#x27;m sure it would work great in the US.</li>
    <li> Too thick &amp; white. Eventually soaks in after about 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> I have tried many brands of physical sunblock. All are a bit greasy and difficult to spread so I&#x27;m used to that. I don&#x27;t feel that this brand is any worse or better in that area. What I don&#x27;t like about this one is the smell. It is worse than others and since there are many to choose from I will likely not purchase this one again. We like the Badger brand tangerine and vanilla or California Baby.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok - has a bit of a funny smell.  I like that it&#x27;s natural and effective, but it goes on a little thicker than I had hoped.</li>
    <li> It works! It does smooth on white. The white doesn&#x27;t fade away over time.</li>
    <li> Great suntan lotion!!!!!! Highly recommend it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Like that it&#x27;s organic but it&#x27;s hard to apply, and has strange smell.</li>
    <li> We LOVE this stuff. Check the EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep website - one of the BEST for health and the environment.  Had a fine experience with seller. Thanks!</li>
    <li> The pediatrician recommended us to use Aveeno sunblock. It broke my 7 month old out into a bad rash. Raw elements worked great on her skin! Goes on thick and stays on!! No rash!</li>
    <li> Worked well.  Before putting it on, placed it outside to let it warm.  Dotted on. For example, dotted it up my arm vs putting a glob at the wrist.  With dotting it, it blended well.</li>
    <li> The BEST healthy sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> It does the job but it&#x27;s a little hard to get it to rub in and stop looking white.</li>
    <li> It takes a little rubbing to get this stuff to soak in but I love that it&#x27;s all ingredients I understand and fell comfortable putting on my toddler. He hasn&#x27;t had any burns or skin reactions. A little goes a long way so though it&#x27;s a little expensive per ounce it last a while.</li>
    <li> I love that the ingredients are so natural, and its ingredients list are one of the best I&#x27;ve seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the cream is extremely difficult to squeeze out of the tube, so packaging could be better.&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, I still got darker (and this is generally a problem I&#x27;ve had with the zinc-based sunscreens....no matter how much I seem to apply, I still get tanned and/or sunburned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note: I use this mainly at the beach, where I am in the water).</li>
    <li> A bit oily but seems to work fine. I had to be careful not to get all over my clothes - you definitely need to wash your hands with soap after applying it. I bought it because of the all natural ingredients. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to really use on a hot sunny day yet to see how well it works yet.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and feel great putting it on my kids.  There&#x27;s so many time the sunscreen burns your face, but i&#x27;ve used this all summer and not one time have my kids or myself complained of stinging on the face.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Works great! In direct midday Costa Rican sun and constantly wet for over 3 hours with no problem. Even kept my bald head from burning. Yes it&#x27;s hard to wash off, but that&#x27;s the whole point. This stuff will stay on and keep you from burning during water sports.</li>
    <li> Had a small bit of basel cell carcinoma removed from the side of my nose two months ago.  Knew it was time to get serious with sunscreen.  I have always been wary of sunscreens and their promises and their side effects.  I was almost always mindful of wearing a hat along with long sleeve, collared shirts when I was in the sun for any length of time.  But what I wasn&#x27;t mindful of was ultraviolet rays coming thru the windows in my home or my car.  So I started reading about sunscreens.  I read lots of product reviews and articles by dermatologists.  I choose Raw Elements Eco Formula 30+ because it&#x27;s made with organic, natural ingredients (including the same zinc oxide that lifeguards were wearing in my youth!), rated #1 by EWG (Environmental Working Group), it&#x27;s gentle to my sensitive skin, and I don&#x27;t have to be concerned about long term effects.  I put it on every morning about 15-30 minutes after I&#x27;ve moisturized my face.  A little bit goes a long way.  The current Amazon price, with my prime free shipping, makes it less expensive than from any other retailer, and it&#x27;s delivered right to my doorstep.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research on a more natural sunscreen and found that I wanted to go with one that used &amp;#34;Macro&amp;#34; (think BIG) particles which this one did.  Was important so that the particles weren&#x27;t small enough (Micro) to absorb into the skin, rather sat on top to protect you.  They call this using &amp;#34;Non Nano&amp;#34; zinc oxide.  This product was listed as one of the safest options on the EWG website (which rates chemicals and products according to toxicity).  With UVA and UVB protection, it works great but is a quite greasy.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend on your face unless you tend to be very dry skinned.  Being that it uses all natural and organic ingredients, it&#x27;s definitely one of the healthier options out there I feel.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin. Along with being very particular about what I put on said sensitive skin. Myself and several of my friends have used this, and we have all been really pleased with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot use regular sunscreen at any time without having a pretty severe reaction -- And while I may be wrong, I&#x27;m of the persuasion that your average sunscreen is actually worse for you than a little sun.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to use this product immediately, and without any kind of reaction. It worked beautifully, and I did not sunburn after being outside in Florida sun for over eight hours!!!</li>
    <li> I began my research for a non-toxic sunscreen.  I do realize it is a all natural item, but I was still surprised at the effort it took to first get the cream out of the bottle -- I even did knead the bottle for about a minute before squeezing!  Overall, my skin does not feel clogged with this product, nor does it feel greasy.  I use this everyday, and I also feel that it moisturizes my skin -- I have not experienced any breakouts even with my pale skin.  You do need to rub this sunscreen in to reduce the &amp;#34;white face&amp;#34; it gives you, but I feel you should be doing this anyway when applying sunscreen.  Additionally, I also like that this sunscreen is non-scented ... I hate the chemical smell and overall greasiness of other sunscreens.  I would purchase this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also made in the USA. :)</li>
    <li> I looked long and hard for a good sunscreen that did not have a ton of harmful chemicals in it.  I chose this for my toddller after reading the ingredients and its &amp;#34;score&amp;#34; on a few natural products websites.  It is definitely VERY thick.  Some other reviewers do not like that - I do.  It lets me know exactly where the lotion is on my little one.  Then, I just rub it in from there.  It make take a few extra minutes to do, but I&#x27;m okay with that, as then I know for sure her skin is completely covered in the sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Excellent sunblock. The best I have ever used. It&#x27;s difficult to find one that performs as advertised and is non-toxic.Massage bottle before using each time, apply to dry skin about 1-inch bead per limb for adult, less for small child. Rub in well, goes on slightly white, but disappears quickly if not over-applied. Very water resistant, somewhat difficult to wash off but that is expected. Prevented burning entirely for 2 hours, even while swimming, but I would use as directed.</li>
    <li> Terrible! It didn&#x27;t work! I still got sunburned after only a few hours of exposure. And it smells terrible! Returning it.</li>
    <li> I am so very, very pleased with this product. I was looking for the most natural sunscreen possible, and came across Raw Elements. I couldn&#x27;t believe the ingredient list! the ONLY active ingredient is Zinc Oxide and EVERY single other inactive ingredient is a completely natural product (mango butter, green tea, black tea, cocoa butter, etc ... ) Sounded too good to be true and based on some other reviews about the consistency, difficulty getting it out of the tube and difficulty rubbing it in - I had my doubts. (I was looking primarily for something I could wear on my face and use on my children) But I ordered the tube of eco+ as well as the eco+ stick. Incredible products! There was no issue AT ALL with getting it out of the tube and rubbed right in leaving NO trace of white residue. I suppose I could see that if the tube was in a cold room, you might need to warm it up a bit first, but ... seriously - who cares? I find that the stick was slightly more of a matte finish than the cream in the tube, but I liked the spreadability of the cream so much that I use that one on my face anyway. It leaves a little bit of a glisten on my face that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all and is very subtle anyway and goes away after wearing for a few minutes. I guess if I HAD to choose, I prefer the cream slightly over the stick because it seems to go on a little easier, but I do like the stick as well and I like it also for ease of portability and to have on hand in my purse, etc. I will 100% be ordering again when I am out of this product. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I think it is a good product. After 2 weeks of using it, I haven&#x27;t been able to yet get used to the smell. The smell does not come from an added fragrance, and I wouldn&#x27;t call it unpleasant exactly; I have a gardening business and eat my bagged lunch between jobs. I definitely don&#x27;t like to smell the sunscreen while I&#x27;m eating. Generally, I put it on after lunch to avoid the smell while I&#x27;m eating. I am picky that way, so it may not be an issue with many people.</li>
    <li> I love the ingredients in this product, doesn&#x27;t concern me at all. It is a thick consistency and takes awhile to rub in, one of the downsides to this ingredient list is that it is a little greasy, but overall great for the swimming pool or the beach!</li>
    <li> This worked very well, in fact, just as well as Badger&#x27;s and Beyond Coastal.  I think it spread better than the other two, making it easier to apply.  Used this in St. John on vacation with my two sisters.  I was the only one who didn&#x27;t get sunburned but still came home tan.  They were complaining about itching and shedding after they got home.  Next time, maybe they&#x27;ll listen to big sister and put on the good sunblock, &amp;#34;Raw Elements&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> Too thick. Yucky smell. Need something else. : (</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if it was the particular tube I got, but my husband works outside all day &amp; when he put this on his face still got burned. I did not try it myself or for my kids yet. I wanted to like it since it is a natural product.</li>
    <li> First time ever to use product and as of right now i am satisfied.  Its smell like sunflower oil and it hard to rub on to my neck, arms and hands but it leave my skin feeling soft.  I don&#x27;t use it on my face because I have an sunscreen specifically for my face&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> Best sunblock\sunscreen I&#x27;ve used.  You could eat this if you had to there are no chemicals or other man made substances found in this.  Also, stays on your skin very well.  warning:  leaves a slight white tint on your skin though when rubbed in.</li>
    <li> This product is ok but way too thick. It doesn&#x27;t rub very smoothly. I bought Burnout Kids and I like that much better.</li>
    <li> Just went to Florida where we were constantly in the sun.  This sunscreen fully protected us.  It&#x27;s thick and takes more time to apply, but it stays on in the water.  And, very important to me, I feel safe putting it on my grandson because it&#x27;s not loaded with questionable chemicals.  The Environmental Working Group gives it a score of 1 with the best score being 0!  If it were easier to apply, I would give it a 6 and consider it the perfect sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Rubs in better than other natural sunscreens. Doesn&#x27;t smell as good and is a bit more greasy than others but that helps it blend. Still plenty thick. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad. I actually prefer it because it blends better than my other types.</li>
    <li> The lotion was very difficult to even get out of the container - had to squeeze and squeeze. It&#x27;s also very greasy. I ditched it immediately and went and bought something else.</li>
    <li> I put this on my kids and it stays on all day at the beach.  I only need to re-apply if they rub it off.  Stays on while in the water.  It is thick so you really have to work it in.  But since you are only doing it once, it is worth it.</li>
    <li> This one spreads better than the other organic sunscreen I purchased, both leave that light white coating and protect against burning about the same.  I would purchase this one again just based on ease of use.</li>
    <li> Fabulous sunscreen.  I swim a lot and I use this on my face.  Great protection, great ingredients.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Doesn&#x27;t dribble down my face even when I&#x27;m sweating like mad.  Protects and is actually good for your skin.  And the price is right!</li>
    <li> Safer ingredients than other sunscreens.  I will continue to use this one.</li>
    <li> The cream inside the tube was so thick it was impossible to apply to skin.  It did not absorb so sat on skin as a white cream.  I hated it and threw it away.  Waste of money, lousy product.</li>
    <li> Love this product! When used sparingly, it does not go on thick and white. Really works. What I like most about this product is that it does not contain any harsh chemicals found in 99% of sunscreens on the market.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Great to have organic non GMO ingredients. I used to live in Florida I was a swimmer, life guard, and swim instructor. I have had several skin cancers removed. Later in life found out the sunscreen I used all those years had several human carcinogens in them hence the reason I probably had skin cancer. This product works great and feels great. Thank you Jesus.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this sunscreen worked well.  The only drawback is that is it &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;; it leaves a shiny film behind.  A plus is that it is fragrance free.</li>
    <li> Before traveling to the Galapagos, I knew I was going to be spending a lot of time in the water and I was concerned about protecting the fragile ecosystem, so I spent a ridiculous amount of time researching reef-safe sunscreens. I read about Raw Elements Eco Form Sunscreen on a snorkeling website, so I purchased it to bring on my trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application: The sunscreen goes on pretty thick, and it takes a lot of work to rub it into your skin. Like a lot of other physical sunscreens, it has a bit of a white cast on your skin. The scent is pleasant and doesn&#x27;t smell too &amp;#34;sunscreeny.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness: I didn&#x27;t get burned anywhere where I applied the sunscreen (I did get burned where I missed a spot, but that&#x27;s my own fault.) It stayed on strong through snorkeling and hiking without washing off. I did find it made my skin kind of moist and sticky - things like stray hairs and sand would stick to my skin, and I couldn&#x27;t really brush them off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to keep in mind is that the bottle is pretty small. It&#x27;s nice to bring in a carry-on since it fits TSA regulations, but if you&#x27;re reapplying a few times a day, the sunscreen goes pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raw Elements Eco Form Sunscreen served my needs pretty well, but it&#x27;s not Holy Grail material, mostly because of the high cost per ounce, difficulty of application, and stickiness on the skin. I think I&#x27;ll be trying out other eco-friendly sunscreens in the future.</li>
    <li> I found this sunscreen at Whole Foods and purchased in anticipation of the summer sun. Overall, I am very happy with my decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sunscreen went on a bit thick at first, but once it rubbed in the felt smooth and good. I must say that I was astonished to have spent an entire day by the pool with ZERO burns and only one application!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smelled different than most products, but I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s due to the all natural ingredients. I must say it was comforting to know that the product is great for your skin. Would definitely recommend and plan on purchasing again. Finally a sunscreen that works!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen works great, but it is very hard to spread!  I have to mix it with a dab of lotion to get good coverage.  It has a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this sunscreen!!  Completely deserves 5 stars!!  This product is easily applied, free of harmful chemicals and smells wonderful.  I have been using this product for a few days shy of a month and it is exactly what I&#x27;ve been searching for all of these years...It doesn&#x27;t budge in the water and won&#x27;t run if you sweat, so no burning eyes!!  Being a young woman, I want to protect my skin from the damage that I have seen the sun cause on some of my friends and family.  This sunscreen is PERFECT for me and has exceeded my expectations!!  :0)</li>
    <li> Great, long-lasting sunscreen. Healthy, with no harmful chemicals. One less star bc of the somewhat odd smell.</li>
    <li> Great protection, no reaction to baby&#x27;s skin</li>
    <li> Love this sunblock! I use this for the body and we use the stick for the face.</li>
    <li> Although I haven&#x27;t had too much sun exposure with the product lately (it&#x27;s winter on the south hemisphere), but it is good to have a natural option when the weather is hot and sunny. I like the product and the only small drawback when compared to other popular brands is the fact that it is not as easy to spread.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product and the company&#x27;s service. No issues here.</li>
    <li> Over the past 5 or so years I have tried many zinc oxide based sunscreens that have clean ingredients. Each one, some more so than others, would make my skin dry out and itch. Even after washing the lotions off, the itchiness would remain. I figured it was just the result of using zinc oxide on my skin (I have 50 year old skin, for reference).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, in what seems like the never-ending quest to find the perfect sunscreen, I picked up a bottle of Raw Elements to try during a vacation in the Caribbean. When I first applied it I thought it might be too oily or heavy feeling, but to my surprise I found that after about 5 or 10 minutes, the oils had absorbed and I was left with a nice sparkle on my skin. Interestingly, even though this sunscreen has a higher percentage of zinc oxide than some others I&#x27;ve used, it does not feel heavy or sticky once absorbed. Usually, I run for a bar of soap or a wet wipe to get the residue off of my palms because I can&#x27;t stand the feeling of the sunscreens, but did not feel the need at all to do this with Raw Elements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I am of Irish and Eastern European decent, my skin is relatively light, so I can&#x27;t speak to how this lotion might appear on darker skin. But it protected mine well and felt great! Bottom line: All my other sunscreens are getting tossed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, for those who say it doesn&#x27;t squeeze/spread easily, I would give this advice. If the sunscreen has been kept in a cold room, it will be a little bit harder to squeeze from the bottle. But as soon as it warms up, piece of cake. I squeeze some into my palm and &amp;#34;dot&amp;#34; the lotion up/down my limbs and it rubs in quite easily and evenly.</li>
    <li> This is a great safe sunscreen for my family that work very well!!</li>
    <li> great stuff! excellent for the kids!</li>
    <li> Wow, this product is everything we dreamed it would be. Vani Hari, Food Babe, listed this as her go-to sunscreen, and now we can see why. My husband is fair-skinned, red-headed, and blue-eyed so we really needed a product we can trust to do the job of protecting him against harmful rays while not containing poisonous chemicals. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I like that it is organic but we found out it must be reapplied much more often for it to work, because everyone got sunburned.  We all agreed that it had a bad smell.  We won&#x27;t purchase this sunscreen again.</li>
    <li> The product worked well. Meaning my sons did not get sunburn while at the beach. The smell was ok but it was a little greasy. However I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Was exactly what I was looking for, living in the southwest, the sun is very intense and even driving will mark your face.&lt;br /&gt;I can feel confidant now when outside in the intense sun. Yes the smell is a little funky, but that comes with the ingredients.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s greasy. If you can live with that, then you should buy this because it&#x27;s natural and doesn&#x27;t contain any of the harsh chemicals that other sunscreens do. It even smells good!</li>
    <li> This sun block smells like plastic and hardly comes out of the tube its so thick. Don&#x27;t like it at all.  Raw Elements CEO got in touch right away though and offered money back so that is a nice gesture.</li>
    <li> Best sunblock I have used.  No drips in the eyes. Easy to get on and off.  Holds up well even when paddling or biking for hours on end in the summer.  No weird ingredients.</li>
    <li> We went to Kaua&#x27;i and after days of re-applying/spraying commercial sunscreens only to have them wash off in the ocean and fry our butts off. We looked for a sunscreen in Kaua&#x27;i and I found this. Let me tell you it lasted all day, you can tell if its on by the water beading up on you, I like how it smells. I can&#x27;t stand how commercial sunblocks feel and smell. This didn&#x27;t make me feel sticky or dirty it felt very clean even after swimming and snorkeling all day it protected my already fried lobster looking body. My kids were protected. It is hard to squeeze out of the tube and it takes some rubbing and time to make sure your covered but to do it once and know your protected  it&#x27;s totally worth it. It&#x27;s ocean friendly and I am going to use this here in California even for the pool, rub it on my kids and we are good to go even kayaking for hours, surfers in Kaua&#x27;i also use this and they hang out out in the water for hours w/o re-applying.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at all. Returned it after first use.</li>
    <li> I like that this product is environmentally responsible and a safe product for my baby, but it is very difficult to get out of the tube.  My first tube burst at the opposite side and some sunscreen came out the other side.  Also, I wish the SPF was a little higher, like that of water babies as I felt like my son got very tan even with a substantial application of this sunscreen (the package claims it lasts for up to 8 hours, but after a maximum of two hours in the sun, with a reapplication during that time, I felt like it was not holding up that well).  He never burned with it, but I feel like when I put on other physical barrier sunscreens with higher SPFs I don&#x27;t really get tan.</li>
    <li> Good sunscreen is must  for our family.  I surf almost everyday.  My two kids in swim team and they swim 2hours everyday outdoor.  Switched sunscreen from Badger sunscreen. This one works  better. Spread out nicer and last longer.  If you don&#x27;t want to leave white residue on your face, go something else with nice smell and lots of chemicals.</li>
    <li> My favorite sunscreen! A little goes a long way, as I mostly use it on my face with a little tinted moisturizer. For me, it acts like a primer.</li>
    <li> This smells TERRIBLE!!! I didn&#x27;t expect it to smell like much but I actually gagged as I was putting it on my face. It seems like something that smells this bad should not be applied to the face or body. I am sure it&#x27;s great as a sunscreen but it has the added (unwanted) bonus of an overall human repellant...</li>
