      <li>At under $12.00 I did not expect much but after reading online reviews about this new formula, I decided to give it a shot, boy did I score.</li>
      <li>I have heard conflicting things, that it is high concentrations of lactic acid(I</li>

      <li>As promised by the manufacturer, I saw a marked difference within 7 days of using the product.  </li>

      <li>In addition, it has a strong chemical odor, obviously it was not pleasant.     </li>
      <li>As an African American woman, it&#x27;s tough to find lightening products that work for darker skin that are actually effective without being harsh.  </li>

<li> it doesnt dry the spot &amp; flake a peel...   </li>

<li> I will definitely be purchasing from amazon again because it is a lot cheaper than what I usually pay when I can find it in the beauty supply stores.</li>
<li> The other thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is that, as I can recall, it doesn&#x27;t list the ingredients.</li>

<li> Let me tell you, if you&#x27;re Dark Skin and want to be 100 %Light skin, try this method and you&#x27;ll see results within a Month which your outer skin will start to peel off.  </li>
<li> i have not yet seen any results ma scars are still dark</li>
<li> Get rid of dark spots.</li>
<li> I order actually two different brands from this seller and both were useless.</li>
<li> The tube looks like it is from the black market.</li>
<li> ma money means a lot to me and i wasted ma money on this product and it&#x27;s been a week and ma scars still here.</li>
<li> What a waste of money.</li>
<li> but then those areas peeled and left behind an even darker mark.</li>
<li> but Don&#x27;t even WASTE your hard earned money on this.</li>
<li> and im becoming very frustrated!</li>
<li> Well, at least I tried and</li>
<li> This product is useless and seller is a scam.</li>
<li> but when you are desperate to treat your skin condition; you will use almost anything.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I used this for a while. It works well but if not careful it can bleach your skin. I had to stop using. Works well though if you want to bleach.</li>
    <li> Ipurchased this product from Amazon because have melasma. So, my face is darker than my natural skin tone.     I heard that this product worked fast to even out your skin tone but it didn&#x27;t do anything for me, even though I used nearly the whole package. But to be fair, melasma is much harder to treat than other forms of hyperpigmentation I have used many other products from health to store bought I will continue to use the remaining tube to see if it can lighten my skin.      If there is another product that might work a little better then this plese let me know.</li>
    <li> I used the whole tube and did not see any results. I am medium tone african american and was using it to get rid of some sun burns I got during the summer. All it did was make my skin feel greesy and look shinny.</li>

The other thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is that, as I can recall, it doesn&#x27;t list the ingredients. So, IDK what I was putting on my face. I have heard conflicting things, that it is high concentrations of lactic acid(I doubt that because I never had a stinging sensation), or that it contains high levels of hydroquinone-a skin lightener.   That makes me feel dubious about about how safe or effective the ingredients are. In addition, it has a strong chemical odor, obviously it was not pleasant.     I will not repurchase this product again, hell, I don&#x27;t think I will purchase Fair&amp;White products again. I just don&#x27;t like the name anyway but when you are desperate to treat your skin condition; you will use almost anything.</li>
    <li> I have no clue if this faded my spots or just moisturized my skin. It has a really strong chemical smell and it is very oily and doesn&#x27;t absorb fast, so wear this at night. I won&#x27;t buy this again, it&#x27;s not really worth the money, when fade creams at your local drug store gives you better results.</li>
    <li> This product works very well and quickly...I have seen my scars lighten significantly within the first few times of using it...I will continue to use it as long as it keeps working like this!...And, it&#x27;s a reasonable price too...Great!</li>
    <li> This gel is a miracle. As promised by the manufacturer, I saw a marked difference within 7 days of using the product.  I am impressed.  As an African American woman, it&#x27;s tough to find lightening products that work for darker skin that are actually effective without being harsh.  The texture is light; the gel disappears into your skin quickly and evenly.  I use it on my face, just once a day, in the mornings before applying sunscreen.  My scars are disappearing.  It really works.</li>
    <li> Oh my God!!  I have only been using this for about 1 week and my brown spots are almost gone.  This gel worked better than any other product I have every used.  I stopped using my other products and now I have purchased more of this line.  I haven&#x27;t seen my skin this beautiful in a long time.  Even my husband noticed the dark spots are almost gone.  Thanks for this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I love All of Fair &amp; White Products. This one seems to light my face the fastest. I use it along with the AHA soap! Started seeing results in about 3 or 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;College Student College Part-time job seekers I wanted to share this opportunity! Register get your our link and start earning today! Goodluck and God Bless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> I bought this for my parents. They have been using it for about 10 years. They use it on the sunspots on their face and they swear by it. It truly does light those spots. Amazon is the best price I have seen.</li>
    <li> It has been a while I ignore the review on this product but it appears in front of me on my screen again so I want to give my 2 cents for those who attempt to buy this product.  This DOES NOT work. No expiration date. The tube looks like it is from the black market. Don&#x27;t be fooled by this one. A mistake when you really need something in emergency that you think it should work the way you wish it to. I don&#x27;t know what they put in there but Don&#x27;t even WASTE your hard earned money on this. There&#x27;s no way the product is made in France!!!  If I could give it zero star, I would but no option to do so.</li>
    <li> I have melasma and have tried everything, hundreds of dollars in peels, creams, etc.  For the first time in years I found something that actually works and does not cost an arm and a leg. At under $12.00 I did not expect much but after reading online reviews about this new formula, I decided to give it a shot, boy did I score. This melasma is about 80% gone with only 1 tube. Along with some mineral make-up, I walk around with full confidence once again.  Thanks Fair and White for an excellent product without hydroquinone.</li>
    <li> I recd this before the promised time .. and was all to happy because I needed it to go with me on a vacation dec 2... I ordered it for a relative .. This is a great product paired with the soap the serum and the lotion .. Thanks for being a good vendor ..</li>
    <li> love it. If your are into these thing this would work just fine for you. Go for it right now.</li>
    <li> I still have the areas that I wanted to lighten, and it lightened around the outside of the darkened as well so it wasn&#x27;t working for me as I wanted.</li>
    <li> Work very for my skin n mom too</li>
    <li> This product is useless and seller is a scam. I tried to returned this product within the return period but seller never responded to me. I order actually two different brands from this seller and both were useless. Anyways, I will do this specific brand and review.&lt;br /&gt;I started using xtreme Brite soap and cream to fix my facial skin pigment and underarms. After I ran my first tube of xtreme brite, I ordered this cream alone with Paris Fair &amp; White Gel Creme Strong Bleaching Treatment. I used this cream religious but I never saw any improvement in my skin. It just didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I have had high hopes in this brand, since I looked up on Youtube and people gave great reviews on it. Well, at least I tried and now I no that I should avoid it.&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t waste your money on this cheap product but if you want to learn from your own experience or maybe lucky than go ahead. it might work for you.</li>
    <li> I luv this product.... it help w the spots.... it doesnt dry the spot &amp; flake a peel...   it has a moisturizers that gently lighten your skin.....</li>
    <li> At first I thought it worked cause my marks lightened but then those areas peeled and left behind an even darker mark.</li>
    <li> I used this product and other Fair &amp; White Products for mixture to bring more &amp;#34;power lightening&amp;#34; to my Skin color. Let me tell you, if you&#x27;re Dark Skin and want to be 100 %Light skin, try this method and you&#x27;ll see results within a Month which your outer skin will start to peel off.  Apply the Mixed products before/and after shower everyday all over your face and body. Stay away from sun light, Good Luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love love all Fair &amp; White products</li>
    <li> I used it several times before going to sleep at night. What a waste of money. It does not work!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and it helps to eliminate scars and an provides an even skin tone. I recommend this product for any one who is having these same challenges.  I will definitely be purchasing from amazon again because it is a lot cheaper than what I usually pay when I can find it in the beauty supply stores.</li>
    <li> I Brought this product a week ago and it hasn&#x27;t done S***. i have not yet seen any results ma scars are still dark and im becoming very frustrated! becuz ma body means a lot to me and it&#x27;s very IMPORTANT to me dat ma body stays looking GOOD.  that&#x27;s why i invested in this product thinking it would do something and make a difference and it DIDN&#x27;t! i&#x27;m highly upset cuz on here y&#x27;all paying 11.00 i paid 13.99 in da beauty supply in ATLANTA, GA and dey LIED TO ME ABOUT THIS SH#T AND WAT IT&#x27;S CAPABLE OF DOING!   ma money means a lot to me and i wasted ma money on this product and it&#x27;s been a week and ma scars still here. i&#x27;m a red bone so just imagine if u buy a product like this THINKING it&#x27;s going to work and do what it says. when actually all it does is make yo skin greasy and shinny! hell, if i wanted to make ma skin greasy and shinny and even smooth i woulda bout some damn olive OIL!  I don&#x27;t know how long it takes for this FAIR AND WHITE \\&quot;EXCLUSIVE\\&quot; gel creme whitenizer to work but u would think just by the name of this product being so long and fancy! it would actually do something! but i&#x27;m here to tell u it don&#x27;t!  all it does is make your skin smooth and SHINNY!   If u looking for a product that does that THIS WOULD BE THE PERFECT PRODUCT FOR U.  All the people who want their scars gone immediantely \\&quot;DON&#x27;T BUY THIS\\&quot;!
