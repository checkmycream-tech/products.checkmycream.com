      <li>I bought it and it is great!</li>
      <li>And they plant trees when you purchase each roll which is wonderful news.</li>
      <li>Abe&#x27;s Market had the best price, and I ordered 14 to start.  </li>
      <li>, it just wasn&#x27;t as great as I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>Great.  </li>
      <li>Great quality and each roll is separated and wrapped.  </li>
      <li>great product,,, 3 ply,,,</li>
      <li>but it turn out to be great.</li>
      <li>My Butt Is Happy.</li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t much good to say about this product.  </li>
      <li>This tissue is not a luxurious one but still in a good quality.</li>
      <li>&gt; Love it!</li>
      <li>The quality is nice and I love it!</li>
      <li>My whole family is very happy with this product.</li>
      <li>Nice packaging, each roll is separate wrapped.</li>
      <li>Trying to eliminate the BPA from my home (plastics, etc), and feel GREAT about this eco-friendly option; albeit at a slightly higher cost.  </li>
      <li>, you HAVE to use more.  </li>
      <li>I am glad I decided to try out this TP.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ve changed many brands to avoid the allergic reaction.</li>
      <li>I know most everything is made in China but</li>
      <li>but I do my best to buy American made at every opportunity    </li>
      <li>I DO LOVE THIS PRODUCT..</li>
      <li>, what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
      <li>But until now this is one of my favorite.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s more, the product is made of bamboo.</li>
      <li>I love that I&#x27;m closing the environmental protection</li>
      <li>I like this toilet paper, best of all.  </li>
      <li>But be honest, I thought it soft and good quality when using it.</li>
      <li>Given that the switch from the quilted stuff has been seamless, I would say this is a great product.</li>
      <li>but I went through it very quickly</li>
      <li>This may not be either the cheapest or best toilet paper, but it definitely makes me feel good by doing something for the trees.</li>
      <li>I can say this is the best green tissue</li>
      <li>It is comfortable and wipes well.</li>
      <li>Overall it is a great toilet paper, great quality.</li>
      <li>I purchased this toilet paper hoping it would be a great product</li>
      <li>Great idea to make toilet paper out of bamboo.</li>
      <li>Much better for the environment, however, you&#x27;ll need to get the cost down if you want this to fly off of the shelves.</li>
      <li>Worth to try!</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t know, I really didn&#x27;t do an analysis of it:)  </li>
      <li>But then, of course, you realize that not even your own fingers are that soft.</li>
      <li>it lasts much longer :)</li>
      <li>In addition to the usage, the product is made from Bamboo which can prevent deforestation because the bamboo has very fast growth pace and easy to grow.</li>
      <li>Overall I love it!.</li>
      <li>Made of bamboo, protecting the earth, rolls are separated and wrapped nicely, good quality, easy to discard, feels green when I use it</li>
      <li>Expense compared to non bamboo tissue but worth it.</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s worth to buy.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say it worth every penny but it worth the trying to protect the earth.</li>
      <li>Nice designed and feels different when I use it.</li>
      <li>and I believe they got some kind of standard to import it.</li>
      <li>At the first time I saw my friend&#x27;s house using this paper tissue, I made fun of him because of the name and the picture on the appearance.</li>
      <li>It is strong, soft, and absorbent.</li>
      <li>first I bought it because I just wanted to give it a try.&lt;br</li>
      <li>this product comes nicely wrapped and it is a super green product made from bamboo.</li>
      <li>HI, bought this specific toilet paper because I had read that it was environmentally better, and it was made of better quality ingredients, like bamboo.</li>
      <li>Per roll it is  very costly.  </li>
      <li>and this makes it so much easier to do it.</li>
      <li>and maybe I didn&#x27;t need to use as much of the this TP</li>
      <li>Although I don&#x27;t really see the point in bleaching it at all.</li>
      <li>VERY ABSORBENT AND LIKE</li>
      <li>It pales in comparsion to the BPA free bamboo based toilet paper you can purchase on amazon from kora, don&#x27;t make my mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought this because I have purchased Kora&#x27;s BPA free toilet paper before, which is $6.99 for 12 rolls.</li>
      <li>It pales in comparsion to the BPA free bamboo based toilet paper you can purchase on amazon from kora, don&#x27;t make my mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought this because I have purchased Kora&#x27;s BPA free toilet paper before, which is $6.99 for 12 rolls.</li>
      <li>The toilet paper is 3 layers, non smell, green, strong, soft, nice packed.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not as soft, not as strong (even though it has 3 plies), and with only 220 sheets, it&#x27;s overpriced.  </li>
      <li>, I was surprised that each roll barely lasted one day although maybe I am used to using more of the regular TP</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other brands that claimed no bleach, 100% recycled and natural.</li>
      <li>I really appreciate the fact that it is unbleached and soft.</li>
      <li>However, this is definitely cushy and has a similar thickness to Charmin Extra Strong...and as a result, you do have to use less sheets to achieve the same purpose.</li>
      <li>Or you should try more affordable toilet tree-made toilet paper.</li>
      <li>This is a very soft and absorbent product.</li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive</li>
      <li>The tissue feels much softer and more durable than previous toilet paper I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure whether it is the strongest and most stretchy tissue in the world or not.</li>
      <li>Compare to other toilet paper, it is more stretchy, softer touch.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s 3-ply, soft and stretchy (yep, really), soft to the wipe.  </li>
      <li>Soft.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery, quality toilet paper.</li>
      <li>However, ever wonder why these plumped rolls of toilet paper (2-ply) go so fast?  </li>
      <li>Using this toilet paper is like being gently tongued by a south pacific island maiden.  </li>
      <li>Certainly different, from traditional toilet paper, not necessarily in a bad way.</li>
      <li>My family is usually very &#x27;green&#x27; in our purchases, until I realized that I had been buying another, more mass-marketed brand of toilet paper out of habit (it is what I had grown up with and just what I bought).</li>
      <li>Soft, not irritating, are what i expected</li>
      <li>This toilet paper is ultra soft, durable, and very natural.</li>
      <li>Now from previously purchasing the 12 rolls from Kora, I thought that seemed right, 12 rolls would be around 12 pounds.</li>
      <li>Now from previously purchasing the 12 rolls from Kora, I thought that seemed right, 12 rolls would be around 12 pounds.</li>
      <li>The first thing that I noticed was that the sheets stretched, yes, stretched.</li>
      <li>It is so soft that sometimes you can&#x27;t feel it and you have a sudden panic that you forgot to use any and are wiping yourself with your bare fingers.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s stretchy and soft enough, but I&#x27;ll stick with Cottenelle.</li>
      <li>definitely worth it because you end up using less to do the same job.</li>
      <li>Made of bamboo, totally sustainable, super green product.</li>
      <li>This toilet paper is just as effective if not better than conventional toilet paper.</li>
      <li>I checked their website and they got better price on it, not sure why the price is slightly difference here...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really a premium toilet and really soft and stretchy than other toilet paper you bought on the market.</li>
      <li>And last, my toilet clogged up a bit more than usual with this stuff, maybe because it&#x27;s thicker than normal TP, not really sure.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is sturdy compared to both tradtional (e.g. Charmin) and green (e.g. Seventh Generation) products, but is still soft.  Each roll is wrapped in paper and the set is delivered in a box so there is no plastic packaging.  Local vendor.</li>
    <li> pro,,,,great toilet paper,,,    con  it is made in china,,  cost is about 1.33 a roll    there are other green paper products that are sold off amazon that are not Chinese made    if it was American made,, I would be a long time customer even at the high cost    great product,,, 3 ply,,, but I do my best to buy American made at every opportunity    I won&#x27;t buy again,,     Buy American made products!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Per roll it is  very costly.  The picture appears to be a four pack of bathroom tissue.  I am trying to be  green but thil not be a product I use.  I am considering returning the  roll.</li>
    <li> After the wear and tear of regular chlorine washed, BPA laden toilet paper....I found BumBoosa.  Abe&#x27;s Market had the best price, and I ordered 14 to start.  It&#x27;s 3-ply, soft and stretchy (yep, really), soft to the wipe.  No itchiness nor residue left behind, that can cause itching during the day (not a good feeling).  Trying to eliminate the BPA from my home (plastics, etc), and feel GREAT about this eco-friendly option; albeit at a slightly higher cost.  However, ever wonder why these plumped rolls of toilet paper (2-ply) go so fast?  Sometimes they are so-o-o thin, you HAVE to use more.  BumBoosa&#x27;s 3-ply tissue, slows your roll (no pun intended)....it lasts much longer :)</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have purchased Kora&#x27;s BPA free toilet paper before, which is $6.99 for 12 rolls. I thought I would try this out thinking that it was $6.xx for 12 rolls. I saw the title and it says 1 roll with 220 sheets, but if you look in the product description it says 12 pounds! Now from previously purchasing the 12 rolls from Kora, I thought that seemed right, 12 rolls would be around 12 pounds. Nope. You get 1 roll for almost the same amount as you get 12 rolls from Kora. Don&#x27;t buy this. It pales in comparsion to the BPA free bamboo based toilet paper you can purchase on amazon from kora, don&#x27;t make my mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be getting a refund for this dumbboosa crap.</li>
    <li> This tissue is 3-ply people!  It&#x27;s as thick as a paper towel and will clog your toilet like paper towels.  I haven&#x27;t had to plunge my toilet in over 10 years, but since buying this tissue I have to plunge almost daily.  Sick of the mess.  Absolutely idiotic that they made this 3-ply.  Should be 2 ply only.</li>
    <li> Although this is expensive, this is well worth the price. The first thing that I noticed was that the sheets stretched, yes, stretched. So much so that when you tried to rip off the sheets, it left the remaining sheets a little stretched. However, this is definitely cushy and has a similar thickness to Charmin Extra Strong...and as a result, you do have to use less sheets to achieve the same purpose. I would recommend this brand to anyone who likes thicker TP.</li>
    <li> These toilet paper came in with premium quality. Made of bamboo, totally sustainable, super green product. The quality is nice and I love it! Nice designed and feels different when I use it. Compare to other toilet paper, it is more stretchy, softer touch. Made in china but did not see any quality flaw of it. Only draw is it is too expensive, hope they could adjust it in the future.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have purchased Kora&#x27;s BPA free toilet paper before, which is $6.99 for 12 rolls. I thought I would try this out thinking that it was $5.xx for 12 rolls. I saw the title and it says 1 roll with 220 sheets, but if you look in the product description it says 12 pounds! Now from previously purchasing the 12 rolls from Kora, I thought that seemed right, 12 rolls would be around 12 pounds. Nope. You get 1 roll for almost the same amount as you get 12 rolls from Kora. Don&#x27;t buy this. It pales in comparsion to the BPA free bamboo based toilet paper you can purchase on amazon from kora, don&#x27;t make my mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be getting a refund for this dumbboosa crap.</li>
    <li> HI, bought this specific toilet paper because I had read that it was environmentally better, and it was made of better quality ingredients, like bamboo. But, after getting it and using it, nothing different for the price I paid. IT is made in CHINA&amp;#62; WOW , this was shocking. Also, it was not packed the best in the box, and thus was hard to get paper off roll, disappointing to say the least.</li>
    <li> Soft, not irritating, are what i expected</li>
    <li> I DO LOVE THIS PRODUCT..VERY ABSORBENT AND LIKE THAT IT IS MADE  FROM BAMBOO...&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER...&lt;br /&gt;I FEEL RIPPED OFF..&lt;br /&gt;SMALL ROLLS AND VERY SMALL SIZE OF ROLLS....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT IS SO SMALL AND GETS USED UP WAAAAY TO FAST...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT SEEMS LIKE THE WIDTH AND LENGTH OF THE SHEETS HAVE BEEN CUT TO THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE SIZE...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WILL NOT BE BUYING THIS AGAIN....UNLESS THEY COME UP WITH A LONGER..BIGGER...FATTER ROLL</li>
    <li> Very Soft and Cozy. My Butt Is Happy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this toilet paper hoping it would be a great product and it wasn&#x27;t bad, it just wasn&#x27;t as great as I thought it would be. It&#x27;s a tiny bit stretchy which isn&#x27;t too bad, just different. It is thick but I went through it very quickly, I was surprised that each roll barely lasted one day although maybe I am used to using more of the regular TP and maybe I didn&#x27;t need to use as much of the this TP, I don&#x27;t know, I really didn&#x27;t do an analysis of it:)  There are two adults and two kids in our household and for the price, it&#x27;s too expensive. And last, my toilet clogged up a bit more than usual with this stuff, maybe because it&#x27;s thicker than normal TP, not really sure.  The only other bummer is that it&#x27;s made in China so it has to be shipped over here.. I know most everything is made in China but usually that makes stuff cheaper, not more expensive but it is a heavy item when there&#x27;s a case of it so maybe that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s more expensive.  Hopefully one day, this could be made in the USA and the price will come down.</li>
    <li> I can say this is the best green tissue I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;At first I bought it because I just wanted to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;ve never imagined this tissue made from bamboo can be so soft.&lt;br /&gt; Love it!</li>
    <li> Bamboo toilet paper&lt;br /&gt;...this product comes nicely wrapped and it is a super green product made from bamboo. I checked their website and they got better price on it, not sure why the price is slightly difference here... definitely going to buy again...it is the future trend substitute for tree-made paper product.</li>
    <li> I bought it and it is great! The toilet paper is 3 layers, non smell, green, strong, soft, nice packed. Definitely gonna buy it again!</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive so I&#x27;ve changed many brands to avoid the allergic reaction. I&#x27;ve tried many other brands that claimed no bleach, 100% recycled and natural. This is the only one that doesn&#x27;t cause irritation. My whole family is very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> At the first time I saw my friend&#x27;s house using this paper tissue, I made fun of him because of the name and the picture on the appearance. But be honest, I thought it soft and good quality when using it. Then I just bought it several days ago. It turned out that it really saves the amount of use because each time I only need use a small piece of it, comparing to other products, I can use as less as 10 rolls. So it&#x27;s worth to buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether it is the strongest and most stretchy tissue in the world or not. But until now this is one of my favorite. But I notice that this is not made in the USA but in China.</li>
    <li> I am glad I decided to try out this TP. The tissue feels much softer and more durable than previous toilet paper I&#x27;ve used. Rather than using two or three squares folded over per wipe, I can now just use one square without fear of tearing the sheet and getting my fingers dirty!</li>
    <li> I like this toilet paper, best of all.  One roll can last me a long time.  A few sheets do the work of 3x as much of regular toilet paper.  It is a bit stretchy.</li>
    <li> Great idea to make toilet paper out of bamboo. Much better for the environment, however, you&#x27;ll need to get the cost down if you want this to fly off of the shelves. It&#x27;s stretchy and soft enough, but I&#x27;ll stick with Cottenelle.</li>
    <li> Using this toilet paper is like being gently tongued by a south pacific island maiden.  It is so soft that sometimes you can&#x27;t feel it and you have a sudden panic that you forgot to use any and are wiping yourself with your bare fingers.  But then, of course, you realize that not even your own fingers are that soft.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, quality toilet paper. Try it if you a person concern about the earth and with extra money. Or you should try more affordable toilet tree-made toilet paper. Can&#x27;t say it worth every penny but it worth the trying to protect the earth. And they plant trees when you purchase each roll which is wonderful news.</li>
    <li> Great.  It is toilet paper and it works as it should. In addition to the usage, the product is made from Bamboo which can prevent deforestation because the bamboo has very fast growth pace and easy to grow. I would recommend this product to my friends. A piece of complaint, although the paper is 3 layers, it is still not thick enough.</li>
    <li> Does not contribute to deforestation and is not bleached with toxic chemicals, what&#x27;s not to love? Although I don&#x27;t really see the point in bleaching it at all. I think unbleached should be offered. This toilet paper is just as effective if not better than conventional toilet paper. It is comfortable and wipes well.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t much good to say about this product.  Compared to Kora it&#x27;s not as soft, not as strong (even though it has 3 plies), and with only 220 sheets, it&#x27;s overpriced.  I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> This tissue is not a luxurious one but still in a good quality. It is strong, soft, and absorbent. Besides, it is completed made from bamboos instead of trees. That is the biggest motivation for me to buy.</li>
    <li> This toilet paper is ultra soft, durable, and very natural. Since it is all made by bamboo, I would not judge its price. Great quality and each roll is separated and wrapped.  Overall I love it!.</li>
    <li> Soft. Helps the environment. Expense compared to non bamboo tissue but worth it.</li>
    <li> Not concerted about \\&quot;MADE IN CHINA\\&quot; issue. It is made from our earth anyway and I believe the producer has its standard which should be set by US. They have certificates and stuff so it should not be a issue to be concerted. Overall it is a great toilet paper, great quality. Worth to try!</li>
    <li> Certainly different, from traditional toilet paper, not necessarily in a bad way. Never used anything made from bamboo before but it turn out to be great. Did not see anything made in plastic and wrapped in bio-degradable paper. Really a green product!</li>
    <li> My family is usually very &#x27;green&#x27; in our purchases, until I realized that I had been buying another, more mass-marketed brand of toilet paper out of habit (it is what I had grown up with and just what I bought). I decided to order this and see how it went over. No one in my house has said anything negative about it, except that we have to find somewhere to store it. Given that the switch from the quilted stuff has been seamless, I would say this is a great product. I really appreciate the fact that it is unbleached and soft.</li>
    <li> Pros: Made of bamboo, protecting the earth, rolls are separated and wrapped nicely, good quality, easy to discard, feels green when I use it&lt;br /&gt;Cons: made in china, price, the touch is a little bit different(cant tell whether I like it)</li>
    <li> This is a very soft and absorbent product. A bit more expensive than some brands but definitely worth it because you end up using less to do the same job. What&#x27;s more, the product is made of bamboo.</li>
    <li> I love that I&#x27;m closing the environmental protection and this makes it so much easier to do it. This may not be either the cheapest or best toilet paper, but it definitely makes me feel good by doing something for the trees.</li>
    <li> My friend tells me about this brand that all products them made are from Bamboo! It is really expensive though compare to the traditional toilet paper. But! You won&#x27;t regret after using it! It&#x27;s really a premium toilet and really soft and stretchy than other toilet paper you bought on the market. Nice packaging, each roll is separate wrapped. The only thing bugs me is that it is made in China, but I did not see any problem trough my using and I believe they got some kind of standard to import it.</li>
