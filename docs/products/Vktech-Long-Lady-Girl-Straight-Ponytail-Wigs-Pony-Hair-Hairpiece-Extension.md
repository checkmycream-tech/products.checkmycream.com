      <li>the product is good</li>
      <li>And the texture is good</li>
      <li>The hair texture is nice.</li>
      <li>I plan on taking hair from a wig I own and sewing it into this to thicken it up, so</li>
      <li>Looks really nice</li>
      <li>Good product, it&#x27;s easy to put on.</li>
      <li>But on the bright side, it is easy to wear, it will stay on and it is cute.</li>
      <li>I had to cut it to make it seem more natural, but I loved it!!</li>
      <li>Awwww I just want it to arrive.</li>

      <li>I love this product.  </li>

      <li>Ponytail is ok.</li>
      <li>All in all, it was okay while I had it</li>
      <li>They are beautful and I plan on ordering more.</li>
      <li>love this hair piece</li>
      <li>so, do with it what you will:)</li>
      <li>If you honestly buy something that cost so little over the internet, that perhaps should cost much more, I don&#x27;t know what to tell you if you&#x27;re expecting something of great value to arrive!</li>
      <li>but other than that its perfect!</li>
      <li>I loved Seagal&#x27;s ponytail look from the early 90&#x27;s in films like</li>
      <li>Tangled very easy and when I combed it with being very easy with it the hair was starting to com out</li>
      <li>So this helped drastically with being able to cheat my way to it haha</li>
      <li>This piece is nice, I wish it was a little longer in width, but it gets the job done in that you can creat a nice ponytail.</li>
      <li>Feels and looks very real!</li>
      <li>it works very well for the days that I want a quick and easy hairstyle.  </li>
      <li>Very versatile and easy to work with.</li>
      <li>It only has one clip, I would&#x27;ve liked two only because it just makes it feel more secure.</li>
      <li>I have thin hair and it blends perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Does seem to tangle easily and is honestly pretty much what you pay for.</li>
      <li>how is made other wise</li>
      <li>You can see right through the &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; when you put it on.</li>
      <li>Bought for my mother she only got to use them once they got all tangled there really beautiful though looks like human hair</li>
      <li>Iam happy with most of items I purchased from amazon few I will have to send back if coming from vendors</li>
      <li>I was very easily able to match my real hair with the natural hair</li>
      <li>And it tangles rather easy but soft</li>
      <li>but the hair fall off a lot and in the back of the poni tail the thing that hold the hair it is not that great becausr you can only used this as a poni tail you can not play with the hair doing something else</li>
      <li>Recieved it very fast.</li>
      <li>the ponytail lasted for almost nine months and only reason I was able to make it work is because my mom&#x27;s been wearing diff ponytails for years</li>
      <li>exactly like the picture</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s extremely long, but I can work with it, Really don&#x27;t get how them ties at the end work , it needs something a lil more sturdy to hold on with,  other than that the hair itself is good quality</li>
      <li>I bought the black and it matches my black hair perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Long and soft it&#x27;s really nice</li>
      <li>ribbon is not a very thick/dense ribbon, so it doesn&#x27;t secure the pony-tail very well or conceal its edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a fair amount of synthetic hair, however, the &amp;#34;crown&amp;#34; (material underside that keeps the hair in place) and can be felt if I were to touch the hair which is a little self conscious that it can be seen (it cant, but still).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After taking time to make sure it is on correctly/secured, it&#x27;s completely alright.</li>
      <li>Not highly durable but ok for the price.</li>
      <li>Figured as much, but nothing ever indicated this so took a chance.</li>
      <li>While straight it will tangle and the hair with fall off.</li>
      <li>it looks and feels just like real hair.</li>
      <li>Texture like real hair.</li>
      <li>its very versatile.</li>
      <li>reviews noted this product to be very thin/light, and it is--but the biggest issue is the way that the synthetic weft is sewn together.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s basically two rows of glued on pins and a string to tie around your real hair which should be in a bun or ponytail.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very shiny too.</li>
      <li>hair looks real</li>
      <li>The strings don&#x27;t really give me that reassurance.</li>
      <li>Other than that I love the color and the length.</li>
      <li>It sheds pretty easy and was a little darker than I though</li>
      <li>has very soft texture</li>
      <li>LOOKS VERY NATURAL........</li>
      <li>*Marked For Death</li>
      <li>/&gt;The hair near the outer edge is held on by glue and immediately came apart.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It looks and feels like real hair but its also really long!  </li>
      <li>Really you can NEVER wear this ponytail up without displaying your actual hair in the back (if you have it in a bun).</li>
      <li>Smells a little weird when I first open the package but the product itself is good for its price.</li>
      <li>will be buying again in the near future.</li>
      <li>so you can only do so much as far as hair products.</li>
      <li>BUT ITS ALSO KIND OF THIN!</li>
      <li>kool for summer hot days when i dont Want to have hair down..</li>
      <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it tangles quickly and hard to comb or to fix</li>

<li> kool for summer hot days when i dont Want to have hair down..</li>
<li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it tangles quickly and hard to comb or to fix</li>
<li> This hair piece will only last so long</li>
<li> it has a very natural black color I haven&#x27;t seen any shedding or fall out</li>
<li> Only thing is that it&#x27;s very long just like it appears.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s extremely long, and I had to trim it.  </li>
<li> So I could never grow that long ponytail look..</li>
<li> I took Martial Arts for 7 years and received my Black Belt 4 years ago.</li>
<li> And it&#x27;s longer than I expected</li>
<li> Down</li>
<li> One thing is that this hair piece does tangle a little</li>
<li> but I carry a little brush</li>
<li> wasted money on this...</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not too heavy.</li>
<li> Thin and short.</li>
<li> &amp;ive learned a few tricks.</li>
<li> Awsome but its thin but very long..</li>
<li> A little hard to comb.</li>
<li> it would be a little thick.</li>
<li> *Hard to Kill</li>
<li> I like except for it is a little thin.</li>
<li> My bad, you actually need longer hair to use this.</li>
<li> It was so thin and the hair are falling off...</li>
<li> Sooo thin.</li>
<li> the purchase itself isn&#x27;t very devastating to me, but it might be for someone who wants to buy something that will be 100% upon arrival, this being at a 70%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> not worth the money, i wore it once it tangled like crazy very uncomfortable</li>

    <li> 3/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews noted this product to be very thin/light, and it is--but the biggest issue is the way that the synthetic weft is sewn together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair near the outer edge is held on by glue and immediately came apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ribbon is not a very thick/dense ribbon, so it doesn&#x27;t secure the pony-tail very well or conceal its edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a fair amount of synthetic hair, however, the &amp;#34;crown&amp;#34; (material underside that keeps the hair in place) and can be felt if I were to touch the hair which is a little self conscious that it can be seen (it cant, but still).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After taking time to make sure it is on correctly/secured, it&#x27;s completely alright.

If you honestly buy something that cost so little over the internet, that perhaps should cost much more, I don&#x27;t know what to tell you if you&#x27;re expecting something of great value to arrive!</li>

    <li> Recommended one, good quality and beautiful</li>
    <li> I love this product.  it works very well for the days that I want a quick and easy hairstyle.  I will definatelt do business with this company again.</li>
    <li> It only has one clip, I would&#x27;ve liked two only because it just makes it feel more secure. The strings don&#x27;t really give me that reassurance. And it tangles rather easy but soft so, do with it what you will:)</li>
    <li> It looks and feels like real hair but its also really long!  It sheds pretty easy and was a little darker than I though but other than that its perfect!</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and idolize Steven Seagal. I took Martial Arts for 7 years and received my Black Belt 4 years ago. I loved Seagal&#x27;s ponytail look from the early 90&#x27;s in films like *Hard to Kill*, *Marked For Death*. And the later 90&#x27;s *The Glimmerman* and *Fire Down Below*. So I could never grow that long ponytail look..So this helped drastically with being able to cheat my way to it haha</li>
    <li> Feels and looks very real! Only thing is that it&#x27;s very long just like it appears. I had to cut it to make it seem more natural, but I loved it!!</li>
    <li> I just received the ponytail And it&#x27;s longer than I expected so I&#x27;m very happy about that I recently cut my hair and This ponytail  is just what I need need  and you can make it into a braid  you could play with it. And the texture is good it looks and feels just like real hair.</li>
    <li> Thin and short. Wort ponytail  ever</li>
    <li> It was so thin and the hair are falling off...wasted money on this...</li>
    <li> exactly like the picture</li>
    <li> the ponytail lasted for almost nine months and only reason I was able to make it work is because my mom&#x27;s been wearing diff ponytails for years &amp;ive learned a few tricks. Really you can NEVER wear this ponytail up without displaying your actual hair in the back (if you have it in a bun). It&#x27;s basically two rows of glued on pins and a string to tie around your real hair which should be in a bun or ponytail. It&#x27;s synthetic so you can only do so much as far as hair products. DO NOT try to apply heat. All in all, it was okay while I had it but not something I&#x27;d buy again</li>
    <li> Ponytail is ok. Not highly durable but ok for the price.</li>
    <li> i like it! i can curl it without a problem</li>
    <li> great hair piece for Halloween but arrived after Halloween</li>
    <li> Good product, it&#x27;s easy to put on. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it tangles quickly and hard to comb or to fix</li>
    <li> I like except for it is a little thin. Other than that I love the color and the length.</li>
    <li> This hair piece will only last so long and I recommend it you want to keep it longer to braid it. While straight it will tangle and the hair with fall off. But on the bright side, it is easy to wear, it will stay on and it is cute.</li>
    <li> Long and soft it&#x27;s really nice</li>
    <li> not worth the money, i wore it once it tangled like crazy very uncomfortable and u could see my hair through it</li>
    <li> Looks really nice but the hair fall off a lot and in the back of the poni tail the thing that hold the hair it is not that great becausr you can only used this as a poni tail you can not play with the hair doing something else becausr how is made other wise the product is good</li>
    <li> love this hair piece its very versatile. hair looks real has very soft texture I was very easily able to match my real hair with the natural hair im Hispanic it has a very natural black color I haven&#x27;t seen any shedding or fall out I haven&#x27;t washed it and it still looks good after about 5 uses. will be buying again in the near future. One thing is that this hair piece does tangle a little but I carry a little brush but that&#x27;s really no big deal.</li>
    <li> LOOKS VERY NATURAL........BUT ITS ALSO KIND OF THIN! I WILL POST UP A VIDEO AND PICTURE WHEN I TAKE OUT MY BOXBRAIDS</li>
    <li> You cannot find these in any beauty supply store! They are beautful and I plan on ordering more. The wear well and wash well! They are synthetic so you can&#x27;t apply heat to them but if you like a traight style, these are perfect.</li>
    <li> Tangled very easy and when I combed it with being very easy with it the hair was starting to com out 😕</li>
    <li> Item is ok I throught it would be a little thick. It ok to wear.</li>
    <li> Bought for my mother she only got to use them once they got all tangled there really beautiful though looks like human hair</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS HAIR!!!! IT SUCKS!!</li>
    <li> Sooo thin. You can see right through the &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; when you put it on. You can actually see the netting that&#x27;s underneath it. It&#x27;s very shiny too. Looks fake, and sorry I bought it because I&#x27;ll never be wearing it.</li>
    <li> Took a month to receive.  Great quality. I have thin hair and it blends perfectly.  It&#x27;s not too heavy. Some hairpieces are too overbearing,  this one isn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s perfect. I bought the black and it matches my black hair perfectly.  It&#x27;s extremely long, and I had to trim it.  Very versatile and easy to work with.</li>
    <li> Disappointed at the quality of the hair. No thickness to the strands. Will have to go back to beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good deal! Smells a little weird when I first open the package but the product itself is good for its price. Texture like real hair. A little hard to comb.</li>
    <li> My bad, you actually need longer hair to use this. Does not work with short hair. Figured as much, but nothing ever indicated this so took a chance. Does seem to tangle easily and is honestly pretty much what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Recieved it very fast.Awsome but its thin but very long..kool for summer hot days when i dont Want to have hair down..</li>
