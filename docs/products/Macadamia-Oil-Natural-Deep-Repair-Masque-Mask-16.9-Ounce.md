<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is great! I love how it makes my hair feel and smell.</li>
    <li> All right with the the purchase and delivery.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Works awesome. My hair feels super soft.</li>
    <li> This is not the real product, I have used this multiple times before and was looking forward to getting a bigger container of it. The smell tipped me off that it wasn&#x27;t the real product as soon as I opened it. Very frustrated, it smells like Pantene or Tresseme, and it is more white and doesn&#x27;t have the same consistency as the real product. I will be returning it!</li>
    <li> You can wind up paying $20 more for this stuff in a salon.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not big on hair products. In fact I don&#x27;t use anything other than shampoos for my daily rinse, but this stuff.... I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;I actually ran across it at a T.J. Maxx store. My girlfriend told me, it&#x27;s generally expensive but that it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I find myself paying a legitimate price for the item, because it really makes your hair feel great, and it replenishes the scalp. (shampoo/repair masque review)&lt;br /&gt;I have no negative reviews about this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bucky Wilson&lt;br /&gt;www.facebook.com/bucky5676</li>
    <li> The best ever!  Love, love, love this mask!  The slip is wonderful and hair feels as if it&#x27;s drinking in the product.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is not the actual product....it&#x27;s fake.</li>
    <li> I use this once a week after shampooing. My hair is so much healthier. Prevents it from feeling dry. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Ok my hair has never been better, I got this because I had seen so many great reviews of it on you tub (look up Melissa Raymond ), pintrest, and more. So I was willing to fork out the big bucks for it. It was cheaper here that the salon or Target.  I got it and tried it and my coarse medium thick wavy hair just soaked it up like it was holy water. Will be a life user of this forever. I am so thankful I tried this, My hair has never looked better.</li>
    <li> This is the best product, I been using for 5 yrs. Smell so good. I had a lot of compliment for smell.</li>
    <li> Love this product for my hair leaves it soft and helps my hair.</li>
    <li> This has saved my over processed, dry, damaged, bleached, brittle hair!! I only wash my hair 2x a week and I use this as a conditioner both nights.  I supplement with coconut oil once a week and leave in overnight and my hair looks and feels so much better after using this.  This is literally my HOLY GRAIL item and if I could not live without it.  I am so glad that I am able to get it on amazon because I can not find it anywhere in Hawaii and ULTA won&#x27;t ship it to me :(</li>
    <li> My favorite conditioner!!</li>
    <li> Great intense conditioner.  You can even put some on your hair, cover with a plastic cap and leave on for a longer period of time</li>
    <li> Buying this masque is the best thing i have done for my hair. It transform my hair from dull and dry to silk smooth. The way it use to be 10 years ego! Love it!</li>
    <li> A year and a half ago I had to shave my head for medical reasons, which broke my self esteem, and ever since I&#x27;ve been trying to grow it back out! In the time I&#x27;ve been growing it out, I&#x27;ve only grown it to the top of my collar bones, but my hair usually grows a LOT more than only about 7 inches in a year. I heard some very good things about this product, so I decided to try it. As soon as it came in the mail I hopped in the shower and used the product during. I could feel my hair felt healthy, even after just rinsing out the product! My hair usually just looked shiny and felt soft when I used any other product(if that makes sense to anyone else), but this one is amazing! I could feel and see a difference in just one use. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 weeks now, and my hair has grown a noticeable amount; it&#x27;s now below my collar bones, which is about an inch of growth. My hair hasn&#x27;t been growing like this before! It&#x27;s a crazy amount of growth! If you&#x27;re looking to get healthy hair or longer hair, this is definitely the product to buy! I will definitely be buying this product again, even after my hair has gotten as long and healthy as I want it!!!</li>
    <li> This smells great! I love it and the product does what it says. I was excited to purchase it for less through Amazon. Those wondering if its a legitimate product due to its white color, the only research you need to do is go to Macadamia Natural Oils official website and watch the video of this product on their page. The review video posted by them shows a white product in this jar.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner, have been using this for about 5 years.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair mask b/c I&#x27;ve heard amazing things about this product &amp; I was dying to try it b/c I have dry transitioning african American hair. So after it came in the mail everything seemed fine but I decided I wanted to check out the product at the Ulta beauty supply to double check I was given the real product. I opened the jar at Ulta &amp; the product was completely different! The mask at Ulta is very creamy with a metallic gold color to it, however, the product I received from amazon is white &amp; almost clumpy. I refuse to even use what they sent me b/c im afraid of whatever hair goop they put in this jar to try to pass it off as Macadamia Oil Masque. DO NOT BUY THIS! This product is expensive but it really is true when people say u get what u pay for.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair feeling so soft and smooth, repairs damage, and smells great! You only have to use a small amount.</li>
    <li> saw this in canada when i went up.. but it was a lil steep on the price.. so i ordered it and it smells awesome and makes my hair feels smooth... sometimes i don&#x27;t even wash it out until the next day.. kinda small but it has lasted me a while now.. but i also switch up my deep masque so my hair don&#x27;t get too familiar ... something i read somewhere lol</li>
    <li> this really works to restore extremely damaged hair! It was a God send! I didn&#x27;t know what to do about my dry brittle chemically damaged hair which was breaking and falling out. This product rehydrated, softened and nourished my hair back to health. I used A LOT very often but am so happy I did. It may seem expensive, but is  worth every penny!</li>
    <li> The best prudent. Smells like heaven. I love to feel my hair after using it.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend all my friends to use it.</li>
    <li> Love this product on my hair once a week!  it&#x27;s awesome...  pair it with the macadamia healing oil treatment used every day on wet hair and no more winter dryness!  love love love it.</li>
    <li> Made my hair silky smooth and manageable.</li>
    <li> great leaves my hair very soft and shiny !</li>
    <li> The price was great ..this regular item is almost 50.00 and i got it for 20.00 and i got it in two buisness day .i was please.</li>
    <li> Love it! Makes my hair look beautiful. So soft and tangle free, would recommend to anyone. A lot of product for the price</li>
    <li> Great product, not only does it do wonders on my hair but it smells amazing too! It might seem a little pricey but you definitely get your money&#x27;s worth out of it! I love it!</li>
    <li> Nothing special. I get the same results with a cheap hair mask. I didn&#x27;t note any drastic change in the moisture level after I used it and left my hair porous and dull. Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong? Definitely will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I did see an improvement in my hair in terms of softness and shininess but it came at the expense of an itchy scalp!!</li>
    <li> Great conditioner - instantly stops breakage and moisturizes the hair. I am an African American with natural colored treated hair which tends to get dry and this product had been excellent for my 5 year journey.</li>
    <li> The product is not authentic. The real macadamia hair mask should light gold color, but the one professional beauty group sent me was white.</li>
    <li> You always need a great conditioner for natural hair.</li>
    <li> THIS IS NOT THE REAL MACADAMIA OIL PRODUCTS!!!! It is a complete scam! I purchased this product for a second time. When I happened to be at an ULTA, I opened one up to compare with the one I purchased on Amazon and it was not even close to being the same thing. Real Macadamia repair mask is a gold metallic color and smooth consistency. The one I purchased on here was white and clumpy. DO NOT BUY IT OFF AMAZON. Wish I had just splurged and bought it from a reliable supplier.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this hair mask. I have naturally dry curly and I dye it blonde, it makes it so soft and silky.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is great. Yes it has some forbidden ingredients that some curly girls don&#x27;t like but it works well to condition and soften my hair without having to stay on for 30 - 40 minutes.  I wash my hair in the shower, put in the conditioner, proceed to take my shower and when I&#x27;m finished showering I rinse and my hair feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> By far one of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used. Buying it online is a great, lesser expensive alternative to purchasing it in stores. It is definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have very thick but fine hair and need a conditioner that leaves my hair untangled yet not weighted dowm.  I love this conditioner and use it in the shower as my regular conditioner.  A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Wonderful hair conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while, good deep conditioner and great price.</li>
    <li> Wife and daughters love this stuff and it was shipped to us quickly.</li>
    <li> This is my second jar of this and it works wonders on my hair. I leave it on longer than it recommends and it makes my beautiful! It has ceased with shedding and I see the length. Rather pricey but worth it!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works great. I saw a HUGE difference in my hair. Once I started using it.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product. I am african American and I have a relaxer, this product does wonder to my hair. It gives me volume, a nice smooth feel to my texture, shine ect. I love it. I highly recommend it. I plan to see if it is cheaper at target</li>
    <li> Will be using this to replace my Bumble Bumble conditioner I have used for years. This makes a complete difference to my hair making it much strong, shiner, softer, healthier. I just love it worth every penny</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a natural girl and my 4c curl pattern loves this treatment. It hydrates my hair perfectly and smells great too. A must buy.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair smelling great and it is extremely soft and shiny!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this in a while, but it is still, by far, my favorite deep conditioner. It&#x27;s pretty expensive, but it&#x27;s really worth it. A little goes a long way. I think I need to add this back to my list of things to get for my hair. I&#x27;m pretty much in love with this stuff. And the smell is amazing to me!</li>
    <li> FAKE FAKE FAKE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this product if you want frizzy, dry and/or brittle hair. If you want bad hair products, save your money and buy from Walmart.  If you want gorgeous,  healthy and conditioned hair, spend a little more for the real thing. I got burned by buying cheap, so buyer BEWARE!!</li>
    <li> My wife swears by this stuff!</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh! I absolutely love this product! It works wonders for my hair every single time I use it! Your hair will feel sooooo soft after using it that you can&#x27;t stop touching you hair (^_^) This is definitely my favourite deep conditioner that I plan to continue using for the rest of my life. This distributor also delivered on time so thanks guys.</li>
    <li> I had bought the same stuff from a store and decided to try this since it is cheaper. I believe it is a fake duplicate. Doesn&#x27;t do the same as the store bought.</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely one of my most favorite deep conditioners. It&#x27;s so moisturizing and it smells great!! You cant beat the price either its a steal!!</li>
    <li> the best brand. works very good with my hair. first among many cosmetics for hair that helped back soft to my hair</li>
