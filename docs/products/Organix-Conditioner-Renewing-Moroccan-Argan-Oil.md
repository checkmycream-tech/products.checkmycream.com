### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This stuff is great!</li>
      <li>i was impressed.</li>
      <li>have used Pantene for years and been fairly happy with the results, but my hair woman told me once, \\&quot;You spend hundreds of dollars on your hair</li>
      <li>Damaged my hair a great deal.</li>
      <li>In addition, it makes my hair look and feel more burnt than before!!  </li>
      <li>You sniff the bottle and waft the scent to see if it smells good.</li>
      <li>After reading the many reviews, I now understand that this shampoo does great for women of color.</li>
      <li>This is my first time using Organix products and I must say this conditioner is awesome!!!</li>
      <li>This stuff smells amazing</li>
      <li>but I wanted an honest opinion from my hairdresser.</li>
      <li>the Awapuhi Ginger, Keratin Oil, and Biotin Collagen are the best ones for slip, they are very light, and very slippery</li>
      <li>but, about the product, it smells soo good, and it is moisturizing and sulfate free.</li>
      <li>Love love love it!</li>
      <li>I was excited about how good it&#x27;s smelled and bottle is biodegradable supposedly.</li>
      <li>(i didn&#x27;t use an oil by this brand, but by a much better one that I bought at a beauty store)</li>
      <li>but I definitely love the results.</li>
      <li>i love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know that my hair is any stronger after using this product, but it helped to keep tangles at bay for the most part.</li>
      <li>My family is on this line of products as some have different hair types and everyone stays happy.</li>
      <li>My wife has used this product a few times and has been very happy with its results.</li>
      <li>Great product overall.</li>
      <li>- why are you using cheap shampoo and conditioner?\\</li>
      <li>The conditioner helps keep her hair soft and shiny and this bottle is a good value.</li>
      <li>My hair is wavy, has never been dyed, and is generally pretty healthy.  </li>
      <li>but my hair just keeps getting more dry and more and more split ends...</li>
      <li>EVERY time I put it on my hair, it makes my scalp bright RED, and makes my scalp itch and feel like it is burning!!!  </li>
      <li>Sweet.</li>
      <li>It seems good but a lite on the light side if you ask me when I put it on its not that creamy/moisturizing as I would have expected.</li>
      <li>I noticed my hair was very frizzy and tangled after the first use, but I tried using it twice more.  </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend!!!</li>
      <li>After my hair dried it was soft and shiny not to mention it smells great!</li>
      <li>The price was right (something like 9.94 at WalMart,) but the end result was not.  </li>
      <li>I bought both shampoo &amp; conditioner as my hair is fine,dry and VERY straight...</li>
      <li>I fell in love with it last year and haven&#x27;t stopped using organic products since.</li>
      <li>I wish I would gave read the reviews first before buying.</li>
      <li>After the third wash I needed to use many droplets of 100% pure organic argon oil just to run a comb through my hair.</li>
      <li>have since switched back to my old standard Pantene regiment and I am happy once again.  </li>
      <li>..it just seems to dry my hair out more and makes what split ends</li>
      <li>Hair felt pretty soft the next day after rinsing it out, then putting a litte more in on my ends.  </li>
      <li>, I had high hopes, but its pretty much just perfume and some sort of stock creme...</li>
      <li>a certain ingredient doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s good.</li>
      <li>I personally have straight hair and it does wonders, silky, shiny, smooth</li>
      <li>This did absolutely nothing for my hair as either a rinse out or leave in condtioner - except make it feel even drier.  </li>
      <li>it works very well.</li>
      <li>I noticed how much more manageable my hair was even while wet.</li>
      <li>I have several friends with natural hair who love it as well</li>
      <li>And the claims of  natural nourishment but reading the ingredients five of the first seven words contain alcohol and chloride.</li>
      <li>I bought this one in particular because it says it protects your hair while you style with heat.</li>
      <li>Slightly wavy mostly straight, fine strands but lots of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is heavy on the hair but makes it feel dryer and seem more burnt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I do get regular tries..not worth a penny to me</li>
      <li>the Sea Mineral, Kukui oil, and Ginseng Cherry Blossom are next on my list but yea, not many of them are good.</li>
      <li>I was heartbroken when the Tea Tree Mint conditioner didnt live up to expectation, its one of my fav shampoos.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m African american with long thick relaxed hair and this product works great for my hair!!!</li>
      <li>I agree with Sheila, I had the exact same results as her.  </li>
      <li>i bought this along with the organix shampoo from walmart, which is only 9.99 for a big bottle, its more then double the price on here.</li>
      <li>On a positive note, I did also purchase the Oganix Macadamia oil Intensive Moisture Mask, so i gave that a shot - - slathered it on my hair the first time and just left it in overnight(!)</li>
      <li>which is really important because they come out of the bottle easily and its thin enough to distribute without using a lot...</li>
      <li>it works great, they should put those in jars, because unless you use water you can waste about 1/3 of the bottle, because its too thick to come out.</li>
      <li>have almost waist-length, professionally colored hair.  </li>
      <li>This stuff makes my hair silky soft and my boyfriend loves the way my hair smells.</li>
      <li>It was not cheap and it had argan oil, which is the primary ingredient in Moroccan Oil brand</li>
      <li>The conditioner may add some shine, but doesn&#x27;t detangle my naturally curly hair at all.</li>
      <li>Some worked better than others, but at least I had no problems with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used both cheap hair products and expensive salon products, and I can honestly say I&#x27;ve never seen my hair as dry, frizzy, and generally unmanageable as it was when I used this.</li>
      <li>BEWARE of this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used many deep conditioners and oils in the past and have had no problems with any of them, including some with argan oil.  </li>
      <li>wrote this review because I&#x27;m laying in bed not able to sleep because I can&#x27;t get away from the wet dog that is actually my own hair.</li>
      <li>My hair is tangly and frizzy especially on my colored high lights after using it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used Moroccan Oil brand products for a long time, particularly the Treatment, so when I saw this at my grocery store I jumped at it and bought the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I am a fan of Organix Argan Oil and thought the conditioner would be a natural choice to use in that it would have the same effect on my hair as the oil does.</li>
      <li>others like the Coconut Milk or Brazilian Keratin Treatment are entirely too thick, you will have to run some hot water into the bottle and shake up to get it to come out, once you dilute it in some hot water</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this for people with dry hair and who style with a straightener/other heating products on hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After using the giant container of both the shampoo and conditioner (took me almost 2 months I think), I had a dry scalp for the first time in my entire life.  </li>
      <li>I prefer to stick to the other 3 I mentioned above, I think the highly perfumy ones have too much alcohol in them, which ruins its ability to provide slip, which is what you need to work tangles out.</li>

<li> I do not curl or straighten my hair and only occasionally blow dry...</li>
<li> You wash your long brown hair with it.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
<li> I was flummoxed when my hair was dry and frizzy, as though I hadn&#x27;t used conditioner at all.</li>
<li> I went out and purchased a salon dry repair conditioner to try to repair the damage this did after just three washes.  </li>
<li> and now I have dry scalp, flakes, etc that won&#x27;t go</li>
<li> My daughter has hair down past her bottom, and it has made it so much silkier and easier to brush through.  </li>
<li> i have even used it in my hair when it is dry (though again, very little) and it keeps it soft, frizz-free and not oily at all.</li>
<li> Your hair magically smells EXACTLY like a nasty butt wet</li>
<li> I&#x27;m wondering if the woman who had such bad results actually is allergic to some ingredient in this brand, as my daughter and I (shoulder-length processed hair with lots of colored gray) have had tremendous results with these products, the shampoo, conditioner and oil.</li>
<li> Have 3B curly hair in desperate need of moisture and decided to try this after finding it was paraben free.  </li>
<li> There is absolutely no \\&quot;slip\\&quot; to it at all.  </li>
<li> I DONT EVEN WANT MY MONEY BACK SMH WASTE OF MONEY</li>
<li> my hair is about half way down my back and wanting it longer</li>
<li> /&gt;I will say, however, that I had none of the burning scalp/skin irritation issues mentioned in other reviews.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m baffled by the other 5 star reviews.</li>
<li> My hair is thick, long, and dry.</li>
<li> I am mad at myself for plunging in and buying this gigantic size when I really should have bought the smaller one to test it out.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m left to either use another conditioner or to simply tough it out and try to brush wet knots out of my hair.</li>
<li> My hair was not damaged to begin with and after half a bottle of the macadamia oil &amp;#34;conditioner&amp;#34; I had to stop.</li>
<li> Not good, definitely not buying it</li>
<li> The others I bought, although not causing the same burning problem, don&#x27;t work and make my hair look and feel in worse condition than before using them.</li>
<li> It seem to make my dry, lifeless,brittle hair WAY worse...</li>
<li> Waste of money!</li>
<li> A small dab will do.</li>
<li> , my hair seems shinier when I use it, BUT it&#x27;s very difficult to completely wash out.</li>
<li> I do have worse..</li>

    <li> THIS PRODUCT TOOK MY HAIR OUT SMH DO NOT USE IT!!! I DONT EVEN WANT MY MONEY BACK SMH WASTE OF MONEY</li>
    <li> I used this product with the shampoo, conditioned, and the oil and would get the deep conditioning treatment. My hair is thick, long, and dry. It is also color treated. I can color my hair and use this product in a couple of days you can not even tell I had colored because it is repaired and not damaged. I thought well maybe its just me I am going to try this and color which I never do before going to the salon but I wanted an honest opinion from my hairdresser. She said something about the color and then asked when I did it. I told her and she said to me keep using that product because it did so well. I also like to mix it up with the Coconut Milk shampoo and conditioner. My family is on this line of products as some have different hair types and everyone stays happy. Would highly recommend!!! For me it is salon quality with affordable pricing.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a combo at Costco.  It had the shampoo, conditioner and oil.  My daughter has hair down past her bottom, and it has made it so much silkier and easier to brush through.  She also USED to have dandruff, but with this product, it is almost gone.  I&#x27;m wondering if the woman who had such bad results actually is allergic to some ingredient in this brand, as my daughter and I (shoulder-length processed hair with lots of colored gray) have had tremendous results with these products, the shampoo, conditioner and oil.</li>
    <li> BEWARE of this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used many deep conditioners and oils in the past and have had no problems with any of them, including some with argan oil.  Some worked better than others, but at least I had no problems with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product and have tried it throughout the week.  EVERY time I put it on my hair, it makes my scalp bright RED, and makes my scalp itch and feel like it is burning!!!  In addition, it makes my hair look and feel more burnt than before!!  It is heavy on the hair but makes it feel dryer and seem more burnt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m throwing away all the Organix products I bought a week ago.  The others I bought, although not causing the same burning problem, don&#x27;t work and make my hair look and feel in worse condition than before using them.</li>
    <li> I just bough this after using this brand for a while. What I got from this seller was not the shampoo that was supposed to be in the bottle. It smells like home made soap, horrible. I hope I didn&#x27;t ruin my hair.Also the bottle was &amp;#34;sealed&amp;#34; with scotch tape.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I fell in love with it last year and haven&#x27;t stopped using organic products since. I will say its not for wavy/curly hair. I personally have straight hair and it does wonders, silky, shiny, smooth you name it. A bit on the expensive side when compared to herbal essences but I definitely love the results.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing, I had high hopes, but its pretty much just perfume and some sort of stock creme... the Awapuhi Ginger, Keratin Oil, and Biotin Collagen are the best ones for slip, they are very light, and very slippery which is really important because they come out of the bottle easily and its thin enough to distribute without using a lot... others like the Coconut Milk or Brazilian Keratin Treatment are entirely too thick, you will have to run some hot water into the bottle and shake up to get it to come out, once you dilute it in some hot water it works great, they should put those in jars, because unless you use water you can waste about 1/3 of the bottle, because its too thick to come out. I prefer to stick to the other 3 I mentioned above, I think the highly perfumy ones have too much alcohol in them, which ruins its ability to provide slip, which is what you need to work tangles out. I&#x27;m still on the quest to try them all, the Sea Mineral, Kukui oil, and Ginseng Cherry Blossom are next on my list but yea, not many of them are good. I was heartbroken when the Tea Tree Mint conditioner didnt live up to expectation, its one of my fav shampoos.</li>
    <li> Love love love it! This stuff makes my hair silky soft and my boyfriend loves the way my hair smells. Great product overall.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a grocery store, fooled by the packaging (\\&quot;Organic!\\&quot;) and promise of Moroccan argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, my hair seems shinier when I use it, BUT it&#x27;s very difficult to completely wash out. If I do manage to wash it all out I find my hair is almost unmanageably tangled afterwards. The conditioner may add some shine, but doesn&#x27;t detangle my naturally curly hair at all. I&#x27;m left to either use another conditioner or to simply tough it out and try to brush wet knots out of my hair. Not good, definitely not buying it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, however, that I had none of the burning scalp/skin irritation issues mentioned in other reviews.</li>
    <li> It seems good but a lite on the light side if you ask me when I put it on its not that creamy/moisturizing as I would have expected. Seems to get the job done though.</li>
    <li> Disappointed dried my hair out bad. My hair was not damaged to begin with and after half a bottle of the macadamia oil &amp;#34;conditioner&amp;#34; I had to stop. My hair is tangly and frizzy especially on my colored high lights after using it. I was excited about how good it&#x27;s smelled and bottle is biodegradable supposedly. And the claims of  natural nourishment but reading the ingredients five of the first seven words contain alcohol and chloride.</li>
    <li> i love this stuff. it works very well. i have bought this several times. you wont be disappointed. i would recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought both shampoo &amp; conditioner as my hair is fine,dry and VERY straight...my hair is about half way down my back and wanting it longer but my hair just keeps getting more dry and more and more split ends...I do not curl or straighten my hair and only occasionally blow dry...this product is HORRIBLE!.....It seem to make my dry, lifeless,brittle hair WAY worse...I even tried using it only once a week...no luck..it just seems to dry my hair out more and makes what split ends I do have worse..FYI- I do get regular tries..not worth a penny to me..sorry..</li>
    <li> i bought this along with the organix shampoo from walmart, which is only 9.99 for a big bottle, its more then double the price on here. but, about the product, it smells soo good, and it is moisturizing and sulfate free. i was impressed.</li>
    <li> My wife has used this product a few times and has been very happy with its results. The conditioner helps keep her hair soft and shiny and this bottle is a good value. Will look to purchase it again in the future!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know that my hair is any stronger after using this product, but it helped to keep tangles at bay for the most part. I might try the coconut milk conditioner next time.</li>
    <li> Horrible conditioner. Will not recommend to anyone. Broke hair strands when it&#x27;s suppose to strengthen hair. Damaged my hair a great deal. I wish I would gave read the reviews first before buying. Several have posted the same.</li>
    <li> Have 3B curly hair in desperate need of moisture and decided to try this after finding it was paraben free.  The price was right (something like 9.94 at WalMart,) but the end result was not.  This did absolutely nothing for my hair as either a rinse out or leave in condtioner - except make it feel even drier.  There is absolutely no \\&quot;slip\\&quot; to it at all.  Had my son try it as well - same type of hair, but shorter, and the result was the same for him - lots of dryness &amp; frizz.  On a positive note, I did also purchase the Oganix Macadamia oil Intensive Moisture Mask, so i gave that a shot - - slathered it on my hair the first time and just left it in overnight(!) Hair felt pretty soft the next day after rinsing it out, then putting a litte more in on my ends.  i have even used it in my hair when it is dry (though again, very little) and it keeps it soft, frizz-free and not oily at all.</li>
    <li> I agree with Sheila, I had the exact same results as her.  This is terrible conditioner.  Like she said, no slip to it at all.  Waste of money!</li>
    <li> This is the only conditioner with moroccan oil that does what it is supposed to do. A small dab will do.</li>
    <li> This has to be the worst shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve used both cheap hair products and expensive salon products, and I can honestly say I&#x27;ve never seen my hair as dry, frizzy, and generally unmanageable as it was when I used this. My hair is wavy, has never been dyed, and is generally pretty healthy.  I noticed my hair was very frizzy and tangled after the first use, but I tried using it twice more.  After the third wash I needed to use many droplets of 100% pure organic argon oil just to run a comb through my hair. (i didn&#x27;t use an oil by this brand, but by a much better one that I bought at a beauty store) I went out and purchased a salon dry repair conditioner to try to repair the damage this did after just three washes.  I&#x27;m going to throw away the rest of the OGX. This stuff is so bad that I can&#x27;t see it working for any hair type and I&#x27;m baffled by the other 5 star reviews.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Organix Argan Oil and thought the conditioner would be a natural choice to use in that it would have the same effect on my hair as the oil does. Not even close. I was flummoxed when my hair was dry and frizzy, as though I hadn&#x27;t used conditioner at all. I am mad at myself for plunging in and buying this gigantic size when I really should have bought the smaller one to test it out.</li>
    <li> I bought this one in particular because it says it protects your hair while you style with heat. I do believe it does the job for that. I usually rinse with a warm/cool ish temp rather than with hot water which helps. I highly recommend this for people with dry hair and who style with a straightener/other heating products on hair.</li>
    <li> After reading the many reviews, I now understand that this shampoo does great for women of color. I am not a woman of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT. It is magic.&lt;br /&gt;Here is how.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. You sniff the bottle and waft the scent to see if it smells good. Mmmmmmm. YES IT DOES.&lt;br /&gt;2. You wash your long brown hair with it.&lt;br /&gt;3. Your hair magically smells EXACTLY like a nasty butt wet dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars though because I didn&#x27;t go bald.&lt;br /&gt;Worse things could have happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote this review because I&#x27;m laying in bed not able to sleep because I can&#x27;t get away from the wet dog that is actually my own hair. Sweet.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using Organix products and I must say this conditioner is awesome!!! I noticed how much more manageable my hair was even while wet. After my hair dried it was soft and shiny not to mention it smells great! I&#x27;m African american with long thick relaxed hair and this product works great for my hair!!! I have several friends with natural hair who love it as well so I&#x27;ll definitely be recommending this to others!!!</li>
    <li> I thought the oil in this product would make my hair easier to get a comb/brush through, untangled, hydrated, nourished, etc.  Boy was I wrong!  This stuff ruined my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have almost waist-length, professionally colored hair.  Slightly wavy mostly straight, fine strands but lots of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Pantene for years and been fairly happy with the results, but my hair woman told me once, \\&quot;You spend hundreds of dollars on your hair - why are you using cheap shampoo and conditioner?\\&quot;  It made sense to me at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Moroccan Oil brand products for a long time, particularly the Treatment, so when I saw this at my grocery store I jumped at it and bought the shampoo and conditioner.  It was not cheap and it had argan oil, which is the primary ingredient in Moroccan Oil brand products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the giant container of both the shampoo and conditioner (took me almost 2 months I think), I had a dry scalp for the first time in my entire life.  This stuff could not get my tangles out and I had to use a tertiary deep conditioner.  I wish I had just thrown it out.  I think it ruined my scalp and now I have dry scalp, flakes, etc that won&#x27;t go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since switched back to my old standard Pantene regiment and I am happy once again.  I am going to continue using the Moroccan Oil brand argan oil products I have (for STYLING ONLY), but I will never buy THIS \\&quot;Organix\\&quot; brand again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should not skimp on hair products when you spend a lot on your cut and color, but use what works.  Just because it&#x27;s expensive or has a certain ingredient doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s good.</li>
