      <li>I had been using Clairol Natural Instincts (Linen) for years, and was very happy with the product.</li>
      <li>some people&#x27;s hair is more susceptible to lightening from peroxide than others.  </li>
      <li>Makes hair look shiny and healthy.  </li>
      <li>Love this color, hope they never stop making it.</li>
      <li>This is a much more desirable option.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if Clairol has discontinued that color, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere in my area, (Fresno, Ca.).</li>
      <li>I hope it works ok that way.</li>
      <li>I have used many brands and never had issues like this.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to color my hair again so went for semi-permanent.  </li>
      <li>As a result I have always been satisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>I am pleased.</li>
      <li>Buying this 3-pack from Amazon is the most economical way to purchase this amazing product.</li>
      <li>Bright, intense brass.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply, lasts for 4-6 weeks.  </li>
      <li>The 3 boxes arrived in good time, and I proceeded to try the new formula.</li>
      <li>This is a good hair colorant as it leaves my hair really soft and easy to care for.</li>
      <li>assured me that color was still available.</li>
      <li>I cannot find this color in the stores available to me -- so I&#x27;m having to order online.  </li>
      <li>I think I liked the old formula better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so fun to get a package in the mail a couple times a week, too!</li>
      <li>I have used Natural Instincts Linen for many years and have always loved how natural it looked.  </li>
      <li>it did much better and lasted much longer.</li>
      <li>It is a good color for me as I&#x27;m an ash blonde</li>
      <li>It comes with a color-renewal packet that actually worked, much to my delighted surprise.</li>
      <li>Target, Rite-Aide, CVS, Walgreen&#x27;s, Walmart, Von&#x27;s Super Market, Save-Mart.</li>
      <li>I used this medium cool blonde just on the over-bleached sections around my face, and the color took to it nicely.  </li>
      <li>Although Natural Instincts reps say 006 Linen is one of their more popular colors, I can no longer find in in central Florida.  </li>
      <li>The color is the most natural I&#x27;ve found for me.</li>
      <li>It seemed harder to get good coverage that way.</li>
      <li>Great hair color that isn&#x27;t damaging to my hair didn&#x27;t bring out the red highlights in my hair like most other haircolors either</li>
      <li>At home hair color is never as accurate - or as fun - as having it professionally done but this product saves the day.  </li>
      <li>It is very affordable, easy, and very natural looking.</li>
      <li>my natural color is light brown</li>
      <li>It paid for itself the first month, considering the cost of gas, wear and tear on the car, travel time, as well as reducing wait time, standing in lines, travel risk, etc.</li>
      <li>for me, it lasts longer than 28 shampoos, more like double that number.</li>
      <li>This is my wife&#x27;s analysis (I am a male and do not use these products); she says it is her favorite hair color product; it does not damage hair, and it gives her the color that she likes.  </li>
      <li>For the first time ever, my friends asked me what I did to my hair.  </li>
      <li>I felt it wasn&#x27;t gentle on my hair and caused skin irritation on face after rinsing.  </li>
      <li>Box really damaged ,  not in shipping because it was inside a mailing box that had no damage.</li>
      <li>have asked what I use, much to the annoyance of my hairdresser (who is also the owner.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the option.</li>
      <li>People seemed to really like the color, because I received a lot of compliments from friends and family.</li>
      <li>Much faster then having to drive to your hairdresser and pay a fortune for something you can do at home.</li>
      <li>I buy this product all the time because the shade is so natural and pretty.</li>
      <li>I have not had any problem with reddishness or brassiness, but I only buy neutral or cool</li>
      <li>I would love to have the neutral blonde color back</li>
      <li>I also highly recommend Amazon Prime.</li>
      <li>originally thought using lighter shade than my natural hair color would give me blonde &amp;#34;highlights&amp;#34; where I had gray.</li>
      <li>I love the color and wish I could find it in stores but the color doesn&#x27;t last as long as it once did.</li>
      <li>Wash your hair only twice a week, luke warm water (no hot!)</li>
      <li>The new formula doesn&#x27;t cover as well and has an unnatural look.  </li>
      <li>It turns out that the new instructions were misleading.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going back to real hair coloring products, even though they smell up the house.</li>
      <li>Nothing like the old version.  </li>
      <li>Because of that I will be purchasing Natural Instincts off the internet.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more an all over slow fade which is preferable because it buys time when I don&#x27;t have the time or money to color.  </li>
      <li>Please, Clairol, bring back the old formula!!</li>
      <li>I have found this particular color hard to find in the stores, so it is nice to buy it with a few clicks.</li>
      <li>The conditioner makes hair really silky,  My only regret is that I can&#x27;t find this shade in local stores.</li>
      <li>The 2 week touch up is useless and there isn&#x27;t enough of it in a pack to do much good.</li>
      <li>It is a very natural, beachy blonde.</li>
      <li>Even my hairdresser comments that the color looks very natural on me and its application is so simple.</li>
      <li>Mine is apparently susceptible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>still like it because it is not giving me one solid color, but a natural variation of brighter and darker strands.</li>
      <li>And, apparently one cannot simply dye it another color before the washing out process!</li>

<li> Have been using this color for a long time...</li>
<li> I will go back to apply to wet hair.</li>
<li> I googled it and found 100s of other people with the same problem!</li>
<li> Do NOT use on DRY hair.  </li>
<li> I have dark blonde hair that I had highlighted (at a salon)</li>
<li> After Natural Instincts changed the packaging and color names, I used the same number I always used, which was supposed to be the same as the old shade, and was shocked at results.  </li>
<li> and I have trouble finding ash blonde in hair dyes.</li>
<li> If you use on dry hair, your hair will absorb too much pigment, and it will be even worse if your hair is previously processed or has chlorine damage.</li>
<li> If I can&#x27;t find the old solution somewhere, I&#x27;ll be forced to look at products from other companies.  </li>
<li> I get lots of compliments about my hair and other ladies at my salon</li>
<li> And the special solution you put on after two weeks makes it worse!!  </li>
<li> After chatting with Clairol, I found out that it will take at least 48 (not the 28 the box claims) washed to get it out... and it may not all come out as it is darker than my regular hair color.</li>
<li> I ended up squeezing the contents into the sink, washing them down the drain, and throwing away the containers.</li>
<li> I have med-dark blond hair, and this stuff turned my hair DARK, DARK almost black, brown with orange highlights!</li>
<li> I hope I can save someone else from this mess.</li>
<li> The stores have few colors to select from anymore.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> At home hair color is never as accurate - or as fun - as having it professionally done but this product saves the day.  It&#x27;s not permanent color so there is never the harsh line I used to get when my hair grew.  It&#x27;s more an all over slow fade which is preferable because it buys time when I don&#x27;t have the time or money to color.  I mix this product with an anti-brassiness product purchased at a beauty supply store so that my color doesn&#x27;t ever look unintentionally orange.  I&#x27;m done with permanent coloring ... This is a much more desirable option.  Glad we have this option!</li>
    <li> Company has changed the product</li>
    <li> This is such a reliable product and the medium cool blonde such a classic color -- you can&#x27;t go wrong!  I have dark blonde hair that I had highlighted (at a salon) but the stylist went a little crazy around my face.  I used this medium cool blonde just on the over-bleached sections around my face, and the color took to it nicely.  Nothing went \\&quot;orange\\&quot; or warm as I had worried it would.  As we all know, the conditioner in this hair color is some kinda magic!  I did not use the color refresher packet, though: no need for it.  Wash your hair only twice a week, luke warm water (no hot!) and use a good color-conserve shampoo -- you&#x27;ll be shiny &amp; happy for weeks.</li>
    <li> I have med-dark blond hair, and this stuff turned my hair DARK, DARK almost black, brown with orange highlights! I googled it and found 100s of other people with the same problem! After chatting with Clairol, I found out that it will take at least 48 (not the 28 the box claims) washed to get it out... and it may not all come out as it is darker than my regular hair color. And, apparently one cannot simply dye it another color before the washing out process! Even their customer service people admit that they get complaints ALL day long about this stuff. I am SO unhappy. I hope I can save someone else from this mess.</li>
    <li> I had been using Clairol Natural Instincts (Linen) for years, and was very happy with the product. I don&#x27;t know if Clairol has discontinued that color, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere in my area, (Fresno, Ca.). Target, Rite-Aide, CVS, Walgreen&#x27;s, Walmart, Von&#x27;s Super Market, Save-Mart. They all have beauty products, but that color can&#x27;t be found anywhere. I called Clairol and their customer service assured me that color was still available. In desperation I ordered 3 boxes from Amazon. The 3 boxes arrived in good time, and I proceeded to try the new formula. I was a bit disappointed at the directions and coverage. New directions said to apply to dry hair instead of wet. It seemed harder to get good coverage that way. I will go back to apply to wet hair. I hope it works ok that way. I think I liked the old formula better.</li>
    <li> I cannot find this color in the stores available to me -- so I&#x27;m having to order online.  The color is the most natural I&#x27;ve found for me.</li>
    <li> After Natural Instincts changed the packaging and color names, I used the same number I always used, which was supposed to be the same as the old shade, and was shocked at results.  Bright, intense brass.  Nothing like the old version.  It turns out that the new instructions were misleading.  Do NOT use on DRY hair.  Use ONLY ON DAMP HAIR.  If you use on dry hair, your hair will absorb too much pigment, and it will be even worse if your hair is previously processed or has chlorine damage.</li>
    <li> Good price for brand and color.</li>
    <li> I like the idea semi-permanent color that fades out gradually so it doesn&#x27;t give you really obvious roots. However this product does give me some roots, because it does lighten my hair. Although the product does not contain ammonia, it does contain peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to Clairol (I called them up to ask them about it) some people&#x27;s hair is more susceptible to lightening from peroxide than others.  Mine is apparently susceptible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally thought using lighter shade than my natural hair color would give me blonde &amp;#34;highlights&amp;#34; where I had gray. However in my case it is turning all my hair lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still like it because it is not giving me one solid color, but a natural variation of brighter and darker strands. Just in my case those strands are lighter than they used to be. I have not had any problem with reddishness or brassiness, but I only buy neutral or cool colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also for me, it lasts longer than 28 shampoos, more like double that number.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never before used a hair coloring product that didn&#x27;t say &amp;#34;permanent hair color&amp;#34; on the box, but decided to try this one because of the price. After using it according to the directions, I could not see that it had any effect on my hair whatsoever. I tried it on three different occasions, and my hair still looked about the same as before -- white. I ended up squeezing the contents into the sink, washing them down the drain, and throwing away the containers. I&#x27;m going back to real hair coloring products, even though they smell up the house.</li>
    <li> Hideous color. Couldnt give it away. Amazon was gracious enough to refund my money.</li>
    <li> The stores have few colors to select from anymore.  Because of that I will be purchasing Natural Instincts off the internet.  Thanks for the option.</li>
    <li> I really disliked this hair color.  I felt it wasn&#x27;t gentle on my hair and caused skin irritation on face after rinsing.  I have used many brands and never had issues like this.</li>
    <li> Great hair color that isn&#x27;t damaging to my hair didn&#x27;t bring out the red highlights in my hair like most other haircolors either and I like that it has a packet of color refresher to use 2 weeks later.</li>
    <li> Love this color, hope they never stop making it.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, lasts for 4-6 weeks.  The conditioner makes hair really silky,  My only regret is that I can&#x27;t find this shade in local stores.</li>
    <li> best color for my hair I ever used.</li>
    <li> Although Natural Instincts reps say 006 Linen is one of their more popular colors, I can no longer find in in central Florida.  Now my sole source is Amazon.  Even my hairdresser comments that the color looks very natural on me and its application is so simple.</li>
    <li> This color used to be perfect for me but not now.  It turned brassy and red.  Had to wash and wash to get it out.  Never buy this one again!</li>
    <li> I have used Natural Instincts Linen for many years and have always loved how natural it looked.  Not any more!  The new formula doesn&#x27;t cover as well and has an unnatural look.  And the special solution you put on after two weeks makes it worse!!  For the first time ever, my friends asked me what I did to my hair.  If I can&#x27;t find the old solution somewhere, I&#x27;ll be forced to look at products from other companies.  Please, Clairol, bring back the old formula!!</li>
    <li> I love the color and wish I could find it in stores but the color doesn&#x27;t last as long as it once did. I wish Clairol would stop trying to fix what isn&#x27;t broken. I use the blonde but it ends up turning red in just a couple of weeks. I would love to have the neutral blonde color back it did much better and lasted much longer. The 2 week touch up is useless and there isn&#x27;t enough of it in a pack to do much good.</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s analysis (I am a male and do not use these products); she says it is her favorite hair color product; it does not damage hair, and it gives her the color that she likes.  It is the only product that she uses to color her hair.  She says it is really difficult to find this product in stores, so being able to get it on line makes life simpler for her.  (Do you have that feeling that I am only the middleman in this review?)</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to color my hair again so went for semi-permanent.  It is very affordable, easy, and very natural looking. I am pleased.</li>
    <li> Box really damaged ,  not in shipping because it was inside a mailing box that had no damage.</li>
    <li> I buy this product all the time because the shade is so natural and pretty. Also nobody except me seems to notice when my silver roots start showing. I get lots of compliments about my hair and other ladies at my salon have asked what I use, much to the annoyance of my hairdresser (who is also the owner. Heh heh) so yes I would def recommend it .</li>
    <li> I have read tha some individuals are dissatisfied with this product because the color refresher packet that is supposed to be used days later to &amp;#34;restore&amp;#34;color turns hair red.  I have always used just the coloring and thrown the refresher packet away.  I leave the coloring on longer than recommended too.  As a result I have always been satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Color did not last as long as they claim. Not same color as when it used to be 06 Linen.</li>
    <li> great product, great price!</li>
    <li> As my brown hair hair has gone grayer, I needed a lighter color so the roots would be less noticeable, The at-home dyes tend to be brassy and reddish, but not this one! It is a very natural, beachy blonde. Another bonus is that the dye doesn&#x27;t leave a dye mark on my skin from the overspread as I am trying to get all the hair that forms my hairline. People seemed to really like the color, because I received a lot of compliments from friends and family. It comes with a color-renewal packet that actually worked, much to my delighted surprise. Buying this 3-pack from Amazon is the most economical way to purchase this amazing product. I have found this particular color hard to find in the stores, so it is nice to buy it with a few clicks. I keep it on my wish list so I can simply add it to my cart whenever I need to, without having to search the entire site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I also highly recommend Amazon Prime. It paid for itself the first month, considering the cost of gas, wear and tear on the car, travel time, as well as reducing wait time, standing in lines, travel risk, etc. It&#x27;s so fun to get a package in the mail a couple times a week, too!</li>
    <li> Have been using this color for a long time...it seems to be a perfect match for my original color of strawberry blonde...hope they dont decide to discontinue this.</li>
    <li> Perfect color.  Makes hair look shiny and healthy.  Turns gray to blonde for me-my natural color is light brown but I have some gray.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Great color!</li>
    <li> This is a good hair colorant as it leaves my hair really soft and easy to care for. It is a good color for me as I&#x27;m an ash blonde and I have trouble finding ash blonde in hair dyes. I use the color Linen and it is perfect for me year round.&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to find this shade in the stores, but Amazon carries it and it&#x27;s delivered to my door, so no stores involved!&lt;br /&gt;This product has a second refresher hair dye to use after 2 weeks which helps prolong the life of this dye job. I usually get about 3 mons. out of one dye job, and the dye job only takes about 10 mins. The entire process takes about 20mins. to apply dye, sit and wait 10mins, and rinse it out and style. Much faster then having to drive to your hairdresser and pay a fortune for something you can do at home. AND, it looks great!</li>
