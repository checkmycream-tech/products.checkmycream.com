<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> shampoo and conditioner has a great smell.  One to 2 days, all dry, split ends gone and a thick healthy hair returned. good for regular or dyed hair.  worth every penny; just need a little and iit works.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo and conditioner ever!</li>
    <li> Love the New Lanza Keratin Line! My hair dresser used this on my hair not long ago and I was hooked! Great fresh sent and soft, shiny hydrated hair, I have lots of highlights and this shampoo and conditioner works great to keep color! I also use the oil which lasts forever much lighter than Moroccan oil so no it&#x27;s not greasy at all! It is a little expensive but it will keep your hair in excellent condition!! Figure all the products I try I don&#x27;t mind spending a little extra now that I found the best!</li>
    <li> My hair feels very healthy after using.</li>
    <li> At the salon, my hair seemed be smoother after they used it, for the price I probably wouldn&#x27;t but it again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is by far, the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. It adds volume, shine and keeps my hair cleaner longer, allowing me to go 3 days between shampoos.  It&#x27;s concentrated, so very little is needed to do its job</li>
    <li> I have very curly dry hair who fights the frizz war every day of my life. This is the only shampoo conditioner that has ever made my life better. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy these products. I had my hair washed with it at the salon, and loved, loved the smell and how it worked with my hair (I have very curly hair!) It is definitely my splurge!</li>
    <li> Did not like this product. Dried my hair out really bad. I let my mom use it did the same thing. Shipping was fast no leakage</li>
    <li> Product is as described and was delivered as promised  The shampoo and conditioner have improved texture and moisure of hair.  I recommend this product for anyone with dry, over processed or color treated hair.  Although expenssive, we plan to continue using this product.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE, quick delivery.</li>
    <li> This is the best I&#x27;ve found for keeping my hair healthy.  I prefer Lanza products over anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried. This is my favorite shampoo that Lanza makes.</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair smooth and shiny</li>
    <li> This line does an amazong job at hydrating and conditioning my hair. It is expensive...although you do see a difference in your hair. M hair is a lot shinier and softer with minimal fly aways.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different brands, as well as the other Lanza shampoos and conditioners. The Keratin healing oil line is the ultimate best; worth every penny! When I use this shampoo and conditioner I do not need to put any styling product in my hair before blow drying. My hair dries fast and smooth with very little effort. Also, as with any of the Lanza product line, a little bit goes a long way. I go about 3-4 months on the standard size bottle of shampoo and conditioner, and that is washing my hair every other day on average!</li>
    <li> Great product, great price!</li>
    <li> this is an Excellent product!!!!</li>
    <li> Lanza is an incredible product!!! And shipping was surprisingly quick!! This particular is GREAT for curly hair in dry climate; restorative, strengthening and gives volume to some thinning hair. Highly recommend the product and shipper. Thank you</li>
    <li> Great product. Arrived in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I love the way my hair feels after using this shampoo and conditioner!!  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This shampoo/conditioner combo has really worked wonders for my dry, relaxed hair.  I love it.  My hair is much more moisturized and it looks wonderful.  Pricey, but I would recommend to others with relaxed hair who want moisture without feeling greasy or oily.</li>
    <li> This was suggested by my beautian.  My hair in the summer looks like a surfer chicks hair.  Lanza shampoo has changed that.  My hair is shiny and lovely.  I am so surprised with this combo.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I used shampoo and had to use so much to get some lather! I thought because my hair was dirty and full of product. So tried on clean hair same thing!  The shampoo and conditioner is just ok, but smells great! The oil conditioner weights my hair down. So disappointed after reading such good reviews like they put something else in bottle. I used the conditioner they don&#x27;t carry anymore and it worked so well. I am confused as to why product does not work. I will keep using and let ratings know if I get a change in hair... But keep going back to my old shampoo that gives me body and lathers up.</li>
    <li> I really love this shampoo and conditioner and how it makes my hair feel.  I will definitely buy it again and it was much cheaper on Amazon than in the salon.</li>
    <li> This is the # 1 Shampoo on the market and it smells so good and your hair feels great. A must buy</li>
    <li> For my frizzy dry naturally curly hair, these products do wonders!  I know its pricey but worth every penny. You will love!</li>
    <li> These products are wonderful for the health of your hair. Makes hair silky soft and smell amazing. My hairdresser uses these and I feel like the cost is worth the benefits of making your hair look beautiful</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the smell. My hair felt super soft, smooth and very shiny. Worth the higher than average price!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Great smell and a little goes a long way.  I use it every other time I wash my hair though as it is pretty intensive and I don&#x27;t apply the conditioner to my roots to avoid weighing my fine hair down.</li>
    <li> This is not the same product as purchased in a local beauty supply store. Both the shampoo and conditioner are very thin. Not thick and creamy as the ones I purchased before. Not at all happy with the shine and condition of my hair from these products either. This is a second rate knock off of a quality product. I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Huge fan of Lanza and their products.  This has a great smell and if your hair is dry or damaged this duo will help.  Amazon is the best place to buy because there are almost always deals on the products.</li>
    <li> My shipment arrived promptly.  I love this shampoo!  My hair feels soft and the product leaves a very lasting and pleasing frangrance.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my Daughter-in-law for a Christmas gift.  She loves Lanza products.  Quality hair care product.  A little pricy but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> We haven&#x27;t tried the conditioner, but love this shampoo.  Hair seems to look a lot healthier after using this shampoo.  Will definitely use again.</li>
    <li> Like it over all, but can&#x27;t use too often, makes my hair a little oily, have to alternate with other shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;Plan to continue to use.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!!! i&#x27;ve only used it three days and my hair is already very noticeably softer, easy to straighten, healthy looking.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner. Smells great and does exactly what it says it does!&lt;br /&gt;Very fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I need to use a sulfate-free shampoo and a very effective conditioner without any weighty or waxy residue.  I think hair can be tempermental.  I&#x27;ve had mixed results, but I&#x27;m sure weather and other factors have been part of that.  With additional oil and protectant prior to drying, the system works the best.</li>
    <li> soft beautiful voluminous hair with this product. i also use the leave in serum from lanza. my hair is naturally VERY FRIZZY. this eliminates the frizz but keeps the volume.</li>
    <li> great product, expensive but helped my damaged hair</li>
    <li> Love this product! Thx for speedy service.</li>
    <li> great shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> The conditioner is amazing, yes! But the shipper sent two conditioners instead of one shampoo and one conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an expensive shampoo &amp; conditioner, so it is annoying that now I have to buy the shampoo separately.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Leaves my hair smooth and silky.  I have been using it for more than a year.  It is a little expensive, however, it is a great product for your hair.  I will definitely reccommend this product to anyone else.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my hair look and feel wonderful. I received it in just a few days after ordering it for half the price I previously paid for in a salon. Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> Great seller and excellent proudct. Really leaves hair so nice.</li>
    <li> First use my curly dry hair felt real good for 2 days.  I used an oily serum 3rd day for shine.  Washed it the 3rd day as usual with long curly hair and it required the conditioner for a few minutes.  I&#x27;m on day 3 of the 2nd use and its lovely.  Spiral curly hair has a mind if its own and at least now it looks healthy.  Nothing worse than dry frizz.  I color my hair, so 3 days is as long as I can wait to shampoo</li>
    <li> Much preferred over the one I purchased at the salon when I had my first treatment.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair very manageable and I love the fragrance! I absolutely would recommend it for anyone especially frizzy hair!</li>
    <li> The most amazing shampoo ever made!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it is the only thing I have ever found that has helped my hair quit breaking and falling out.  It seems to be growing like crazy, I know that&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s not breaking but it seems to be helping.  User for life, love the Lanza line!</li>
    <li> Great price.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff - my hair is long/thick and coarse.  The shampoo is nice, but the conditioner really helps to keep my hair soft and from being so frizzy.  and it smells great!</li>
    <li> Such as good as I wouldn&#x27;t expected! Really recomended  for dried  and damaged hair!!</li>
    <li> Love this. I have tried many good brands. This is the best.</li>
    <li> I have only used this once so far, but let me just tell you it really seemed to improve the overall look of my hair. My hair seemed soft, shiny, and my ends looked and felt so much better. On top of all those positive things, it made my hair smell wonderful too. I am excited to see how it keeps doing wonders to my hair.</li>
    <li> It is by far, the best shampoo and conditioner I have found to date for my limp hair. It gives it so much body. I don&#x27;t use it everyday because it does have a bit of build up but when I do, love it.</li>
    <li> I have the healing oil but my stylist started using the shampoo and conditioner and wow!  I can tell that my hair is healthier and not as dry.  I would highly recommend to anyone that gets there hair color often.</li>
    <li> Eh.  I don&#x27;t understand all the hype.  If you have hair that has become very dry I say stick with Kerastase.</li>
    <li> Shampoo bottle was only half full.&lt;br /&gt;The top had opened and leaked shampoo&lt;br /&gt;In the shipping envelope.</li>
    <li> My hair looks and feels completely different! A coworker just commented on how healthy and strong it looks. So happy I&#x27;ve found these products!</li>
    <li> I get these for my wife and she loves them. We&#x27;ve tried the blue &#x27;flavor&#x27; as well, but she likes the brown bottles better. I can&#x27;t argue with the results, her hair looks great!</li>
    <li> This product leaves your hair manageable and soft. As advertised and previously reviewed.  Would buy again and  refer to friends.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Smells great and makes the hair very soft and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely loved it, wish it was cheaper...</li>
    <li> Love, love this product , is just perfect for tire blonde hair , now they look shiny I so smooth . I will buy this forever!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice product. It smells good and it came nicely packaged.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of the conditioner.  But the shampoo is nice when paired with a different conditioner.</li>
    <li> The most fabulous product I have ever used!  The smell is unbelievable!</li>
    <li> These products are the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used!! I wouldn&#x27;t pay the type of money my salon charges though so I am very happy they have them on amazon!!!</li>
    <li> Bought for  my daughter who lives in Florida and complains of dry hair.  She loves the product and will definitely be buying regularly.&lt;br /&gt;IT LEAVES HER HAIR SOFT &amp; SILKY</li>
    <li> I keep ordering these hair products. Love the smell and they work great.</li>
    <li> bought this for my daughter. A bit pricey, but worth it. A little goes a long way! Smells so good! Her hair is smooth, shiny and healthy!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t do many reviews, however I purchased this after buying some in the salon from a Lanza rep. For whatever reason, these bottles were much more &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; than the salon bottles and much thinner. The conditioner came out of the bottle like it had been cut by 75% with water, where the conditioner from the salon was very thick. These did not have as much of a great scent either. Disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love the product and much less expensive than at the salon - they were charging 98. for both - glad I found this!</li>
    <li> I have only been using the product for a short time, as in a week, but my hair is softer and shinier.  The frizzing was noticeably less after using the oil with these products.  I will up date after a few more weeks.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Tames hair, smells good.  Definitely a favorite of mine.</li>
    <li> I am a hair product junkie, recently had my first keratin treatment, just the one that lasts 6 wks, bought the products the sell you at the salon, I was very disappointed with my keratin, then I washed my hair with the shampoo and conditioner I usually use, jellua, which I thought I loved, and realized the keratin worked just fine it was the shampoo they had sold me. I was running low and the jellua is expensive so I had to re order, and investigated good keratin shampoos, this came up, gave it a try, and OMG amazing stuff. I truly cant believe how much better my hair is feeling, I have very thin wavy hair that breaks and frizzes badly, this stuff, along with the keratin treatment im sure, has transformed my hair. even compared to the jellua which has been my favorite for a long time, when I washed with the shampoo I wasn&#x27;t too impressed seemed the same, then used the conditioner and it was so smoothing, and when I blowed dry I was amazed, smooth,no frizz, no need to flat iron. I just ordered the 33oz bottle of each because im panicking they wont have it in stock when I need to re order. try it you will love it.but found it cheaper on pandorabeauty.com</li>
    <li> Great product, works amazing, and smells fantastic.</li>
    <li> Did not make my hair feel good at all.  Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great Product, haven&#x27;t found anything from Lanza that doesn&#x27;t work as advertised.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Anza overall is a pretty awesome brand. This shampoo &amp; conditioners are keepers because the smell, texture &amp; feel is really nice; end result, hoping for better &amp; content enough with the overall shine &amp; treatment of my hair that I decided to keep it in my rotation. Would I purchase these again? Eh, not so much.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I would not buy this again.  It made may hair to oily.  It also made my hair limp like I had not washed my hair with shampoo.</li>
    <li> The Lanza line is great anyway but the new Keratin products are wonderful.  My hair was dry and unresponsive but this brought it back to life.  Also the smell is wonderful.  My husband loved how my hair smelled.</li>
