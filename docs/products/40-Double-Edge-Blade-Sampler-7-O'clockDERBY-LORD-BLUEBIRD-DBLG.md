      <li>Of these, the Lord blades have given me the best shave; but as others have mentioned you&#x27;re better off trying several brands to find the right one for your face/beard since we&#x27;re all different.  </li>

      <li>I wanted to try the derby blades, but also heard good things about the blue bird ones.  </li>
      <li>This one set should last you six months or more at pennies per blade, before you pick a favorite brand.</li>

      <li>I received this sampler pack much sooner than expected, and it&#x27;s been great so far!</li>

      <li>Having gone back to an &amp;#34;old style&amp;#34; razor because of the price of the multi blade types I wasn&#x27;t sure of which blades to buy for it.  </li>
      <li>do* like to know for certain which blades to buy in bulk.</li>
      <li>A good choice if you&#x27;re new to double edge razors and need to develop your style while trying different blades.</li>
      <li>Mission accomplished.  </li>
      <li>With a couple months&#x27; attentive practice you can be as fast and effective with these as with expensive disposables -- $5-per-cartridge Gillette can KMA!</li>
      <li>The Lord blades did not cut well in neither my Gillette Super Speed nor my Tech, which left me with 3 blades in one pack plus an entire 5 blade pack which was discarded.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Everyone has different blade preferences, just like with safety razors or straight razors.</li>
      <li>So far the Gillette 7O&#x27;clock and Lord are my favorites</li>
      <li>Some sampler packs will only give you 2 blades of a particular brand.  </li>
      <li>I have only used Derby and Lord blades so far and have no complaints.</li>
      <li>A variety pack is fun and let&#x27;s you find something you like, but you&#x27;ll have to suffer through a few blades that you will dislike.</li>
      <li>I found that sometimes one razor would work well with a particular blade while my other razor would not work so well.  </li>
      <li>I live in a remote area</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really like the derby blades best. Over all the blades work well and I change them about every two weeks.</li>
    <li> This is a very handy sample pack for a first time buyer to see what of the many blades are best. I live in a remote area so this works perfectly for me to then know which product to continue with. The price is good and the delivery was impressive, considering the postage distance.</li>
    <li> They fit in my razor and shave the hair from my face and head. What&#x27;s not to like?  I have only used Derby and Lord blades so far and have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Not much to say, it&#x27;s a sampler pack. Helped me figure out which blade(s) I like the best</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great selection of razor blades to help you figure out the ideal blade you YOU! For me, I&#x27;ve learned that nothing works as well as Feather blades (not included in the package.) But that&#x27;s just me. The LORD blades in this package do not work well for me at all. Very uncomfortable. But again, that&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> A nice starter pack for those just beginning to shave with a safety razor.  Allows you to try different types of blades to see which you prefer.</li>
    <li> This is a good variety pack of multiple brands.  I wanted to try the derby blades, but also heard good things about the blue bird ones.  Each package of five is individually packaged, so if you keep them in a moist bathroom, they won&#x27;t get rusty.</li>
    <li> These blades arrived new-in-package and just as promised.  I have tried them and like some and not others, but that is all personal preference.  As for the product, it came here just as pictured.</li>
    <li> Everyone has different blade preferences, just like with safety razors or straight razors. A variety pack is fun and let&#x27;s you find something you like, but you&#x27;ll have to suffer through a few blades that you will dislike.</li>
    <li> I just recently ordered these to see which type of blade would be best for me, since my friends suggested that there is never just one goto blade for any one person. They were packaged nicely and haven&#x27;t had a bad shave experience with any of these products.</li>
    <li> Last variety pack I will need to buy. I fell in love with the Lord Blades. Perfect for my scruff.</li>
    <li> Great sampler, find some blades I liked and some I didn&#x27;t. As a starter to DE shaving it was good to have the chance to find blades that worked for me.</li>
    <li> I received this sampler pack much sooner than expected, and it&#x27;s been great so far! A must have for anybody starting double-edge razor shaving.</li>
    <li> Having gone back to an &amp;#34;old style&amp;#34; razor because of the price of the multi blade types I wasn&#x27;t sure of which blades to buy for it.

    <li> Great introductory pack of blades</li>
    <li> Great deal to try out a variety of different blades.  So far the Gillette 7O&#x27;clock and Lord are my favorites</li>
    <li> A good choice if you&#x27;re new to double edge razors and need to develop your style while trying different blades. This one set should last you six months or more at pennies per blade, before you pick a favorite brand. (I liked Bluebird and Derby best.) With a couple months&#x27; attentive practice you can be as fast and effective with these as with expensive disposables -- $5-per-cartridge Gillette can KMA! Then go buy a car with the money you&#x27;ll save.</li>
    <li> Not the best selection of blades. They worked well enough, but I wish I would have purchased 8 different 5 blade packs instead of 4 pairs of packs. The Lord blades did not cut well in neither my Gillette Super Speed nor my Tech, which left me with 3 blades in one pack plus an entire 5 blade pack which was discarded.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite blade from the set would have to be the Derby, although I would look to drop a couple more dollars on a higher end sample set. The Bluebird were okay and the Gillette 7 O&#x27;clocks performed rather well, but not my favorite.</li>
    <li> This sampler pack is a great way to try various blades as you get started with DE shaving.  If you have more than one razor be sure to try the blades in each one.  I found that sometimes one razor would work well with a particular blade while my other razor would not work so well.  Some sampler packs will only give you 2 blades of a particular brand.  Personally I prefer this type of pack where you get 10 blades each.  Sure you may not use all of the blades that you don&#x27;t like.  But the flip-side is that you have plenty of the blades you *do* like to know for certain which blades to buy in bulk.</li>
