<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> what i like is vary good ,what i donot like does not work for me</li>
    <li> wish it didn&#x27;t peel as easily as it does though</li>
    <li> I have used these products for over a year and love them.  They really help weak, peeling natural nails.  Just follow the directions and use all 3 prodcuts and in a few weeks your natural nails will be beatiful</li>
    <li> Best product! Very nice for nails!After use, within 14 days of this product my nails are much stronger, longer exfoliate and look great</li>
    <li> If you have had acrylics and take them off, this is the stuff for you.  If you use it correctly for a couple of weeks, your nails will absolutely be back to normal or even better.  I like the kit because you have the ridgefiller and then the top coat.  You put the top coat on daily and then take it off after a week.  The nail oil is great too.  I bought several different things to try to mend my thin and damaged nails and a friend recommended this and it works!!!  This stuff is terrific even if you don&#x27;t need it for transition.  You will have much stronger nails within 2 weeks.  Be patient with it and you will see results.</li>
    <li> Great kit - a bottle of clear nail polish, one of a white-tinted matter underpolish, and the last has a blue cuticle conditioner. I&#x27;ve tried them all, and they all work beautifully. The clear one is an amazing nail protector. I like clear nail polish for daytime wear, and this is as shiny and pretty a clear as you&#x27;ll find. It is also holding my nail together - one of them mostly tore off the other day and I tried putting another coat of the nail protectant on and using it as a sort of glue. It has worked perfectly, and no one knows which nail is torn - and I&#x27;m not telling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One gotcha - the writing on the bottles and the instruction sheet is almost unreadable because it is so tiny. This is because the package uses about four different languages on it, and it&#x27;s not like a nail polish bottle is overly spacious anyway. I got out my glasses and a magnifying glass and it was fine. Nothing really funky about the instructions, but it would be nice to be able to read it easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a fine purchase of great products at a fair price. Can&#x27;t really ask for much more.</li>
    <li> It works! This trio has grown my nails when used faithfully. I wash my dishes by hand, without gloves - water makes these products soft. Gloves recommended to protect polish and nails.</li>
    <li> Helps keep my nails strong and prevents them from breaking.</li>
    <li> I have been using &amp;#34;Nail Tek&amp;#34; products for almost 20 years.  It is another one of my favorite nail products. It helps to restore damaged, weak, and/or peeling nails to vigorous, long, strong nails even if your nails were never long or strong. You do have to follow a nail care regime, but its quick and effective. Also, a speedy delivery and product properly fits sellers description of it.</li>
    <li> I used this years ago. Is a great product for weak and brittle nails. I highly recommended . The price for all 3 products was great.</li>
    <li> One of the bottles was leaking upon arrival. They wouldn&#x27;t replace it unless I returned the original, but that would&#x27;ve been too messy. I do think the product works, though.</li>
    <li> Great for weak nails that require extra attention.&lt;br /&gt; Less expensive at Amazon than in beauty supply stores.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for a couple years and love it.</li>
    <li> Who needs fake nails with Nail Tek? This set can reverse the damaged done by years of using acrylic nails. Stop wasting money and invest I. This stuff. It works!</li>
    <li> Day one,  I knew this was the bomb!  My cuticles using various other products has always dried back up before the end of my shift no matter what. ..... yesterday. .....I used the oil and washed my hands threw out the day and my cuticles were beautiful. ..... last all day long literally. ..</li>
    <li> I have only used nail tek twice but so far I am very happy with it in place of my acrylics! Will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> I love this kit and use it a great deal.  I have really dry and cracked nails and this product has helped with stopping the cracking and allowing me to grow them out longer.  I love the cuticle softer as my hands are always dry.</li>
    <li> I have used Nail Tek for several years. Great product. Actually does what it says it will do! Have recommended it to friends.</li>
    <li> I had purchased both foundation and therapy for almost $8 from another seller (but with this seller I&#x27;m paying just about the same price and getting a third bottle which is a cuticle oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting 3 bottles instead of two for just about $8 is way more than a GREAT DEAL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using NAIL TEK since January 2013 and my nails have never (look-been) stronger, healthier, longer and beautiful, they don&#x27;t peel as much as before and I have gone 2 and a half months without breaking a nail.. AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANT!!!&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice or three times a week.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy from this seller again!!!&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was 3 days before expected delivery date and that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> hello&lt;br /&gt;just received the product, a friend bought it for me from the states, then I found that statement,  product contain chemical known to the state of California to cause cancer.&lt;br /&gt;will I still use it.&lt;br /&gt;why no hint about it was mentioned. in the advert.</li>
    <li> This a great product.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I was up in the air about buying this product. I already used the nail tek Xtra so I said why not. I took off my acrylic nails and with in two days I saw improvements in my nails. They were starting to thicken up and were not as thin the foundation 2is a godsend I love it it helps polish stay on way longer than the average base coat. The oil has done wonders for my nails they look healthy and are growing strong.</li>
    <li> I love this kit it has everything you need to make your nails stronger. my nails were paper thin after I removed the nail coating.  I just started and so far my nails are no longer chipping and breaking. My cuticals no longer hurting and my nails are stronger.</li>
    <li> The price was a bargain, Im not really a fan of the Intensive treatment for soft peeling because I prefer the Xtra because it actually made my nails strong and long as hell! I never could have long nails because they break before they can go pass my finger tip. I will never use nothing else but the nail trek Xtra! I&#x27;ll just use the intensive on my toes</li>
    <li> Amazing my nails were always weak I also recently took off my tips and started using this they&#x27;re no strong and growing! No more brittle nails.</li>
    <li> Would not buy the kit again.  The ridge filler slid off nails after one day.</li>
    <li> This system works great. seeing great growth. wanted to grow out my natural nails and this did the trick. Didnt think it would work but these products do.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product.  I do like it and use it every week it works very well...</li>
    <li> Awesome.  My nails were brittle and separating.  Now they&#x27;re getting healthier every day.  Love this kit.</li>
    <li> Nail Tek is hard to find in stores.  I&#x27;m so glad to be able to easily order it through Amazon.com.  My nails haven&#x27;t been the same since I stopped getting silk wraps.  The extra layers that this tough stuff offers lets my nails grow out to a pretty length.  I also like the matte finish of the ridge filler.  My own natural nails have never looked better.</li>
    <li> This was ok not something I will buy again, but I wash my hands a lot and take baths, so the polish didn&#x27;t stay on very well.</li>
    <li> These products really work on damaged nails.  I have been using it for several months and there is a noticeable difference.  Sheila Welt</li>
    <li> Last forever!  Really works and makes your polish last longer.  Very professional results.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest set.  I’ve used it twice and already and can tell the difference!  Great way to strengthen your nails!</li>
    <li> How I wish I could give this 5 stars.  I have very brittle, pealing nails. Have used all three products for months with no change.</li>
    <li> My nails are horrible.  This product made my nails look better in a weeks time.</li>
    <li> It really helps my nail strengthen and protected.&lt;br /&gt;I am 100% sure that these three bottles are must have Items!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent service and product. Thanks</li>
    <li> This product made my nails grow, it didn&#x27;t take long for them to grow either this is pretty dam amazing</li>
    <li> This product is great, it keeps my natural nails looking nice.  Would recoomend this product to anyone who has uses artifical nail before and they want to go back to natural.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that I have found that works. My nails are stronger and healthier. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Nails are starting to look great</li>
    <li> Just as described.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Used this product in the past and it is a wonderful strengthener.  My nails were naturally brittle and now they are much stronger after using in less than two weeks.</li>
    <li> Did not meat expectations my nails are the same, no improvement.</li>
    <li> Very easy transaction - good products!</li>
    <li> I have used this product before, and I know for sure that it definitely works.</li>
    <li> Great purchase . I have thin and weak nails ...This kit is amazing. The oil has really helped my cuticles to heal and my nails never looked better.</li>
    <li> As a family physician, I wash my hands up to 100 times per day. That is tough on skin and nails. This is the only kit that reliably helps to strengthen my nails and prevent breakage and damage.</li>
    <li> I suffered with week nails that were thin and peeling - nothing seem to work for me until Nail Tek II.  In five days my nails were no longer peeling or thin, they are actually stronger and this is no exaggeration.  I followed instructions and use the strengthener and renew on a daily basis.  In another two days I will remove all product from my names and start over.  This definitely will be my go to product from now on.</li>
    <li> Excellent trio love this stuff</li>
    <li> this product SUCKS!!!</li>
    <li> This grouping is all that you&#x27;ll need to nurture a new set of strong and healthy nails. It&#x27;s transformative !</li>
    <li> This worked miracles on my nails after I had fake nails on and they were destroyed.</li>
    <li> Working really great after fighting my chalk-like crumbly nails for several years now.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. It is the only one I have found that helps my nails grow. It can be a bit smelly at first,.but like any nail polish it fades.</li>
    <li> I &#x27;ve been an addict to acrylic nails for many years. My nails are very weak andf thin. I&#x27;ve een using this product for one month as directed. My nails are looking much better now.After treating myself to a Professional manicure and polish they were beautiful for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I used this for a while, it works but Nailtiques are much better.</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve always kept my nails short because they were soft and broke easily.  After only a few weeks of using the Nail Tek transition system my nails are stronger, healthier, and grow faster.  Whether you&#x27;re growing out acrylics or want healthy natural nails, I recommend Nail Tek products to anyone looking for serious therapy for their nails.</li>
    <li> I love the product. It works very well. But it came in about 3 weeks late. I was very upset.</li>
    <li> I used these products for about 5 weeks, and I couldn&#x27;t tell any improvement in my nails. They still split.</li>
    <li> Quality product and will use nothing else. Buy this product and you will love it .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s one of the best I have ever used xxx</li>
    <li> This product has brought my nails back to life. I used to do my nails and those chemicals made my nails paper thin. I decide to try this product and I&#x27;m very pleased that my nails are strong, growing and looking beautiful.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and fast shipping! !</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for three months now and my nails are growing fast. It has been 17 years since I have seen my natural nail and have had acrylics. I am VERY please with the results, and I would recommend this kit to anyone.</li>
    <li> I really love this product! it has really help strengthen my nails and promote growth. I was really skeptical about buying the product because i have bought nail products in the past that has not worked. But i had a friend who recently bought the product and loved it. She advised me to try it and i am so happy she did! Great Product!!!! Very satisfied with its results.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this to repair nails from artificial nail removal like they talk about, but instead just to help my thin nails to strengthen up a bit because they peel apart.  This seems to be working pretty nicely.  I usually can&#x27;t make it a full week and only get about 4-5 days, but that is the same as almost all products because I am too hard on my hands and do not like to wear gloves.</li>
    <li> So far the results are very good.</li>
    <li> The product has a great reputation. Looking forward to trying it when I remove my fake nails. Real is better (hopefully.)</li>
    <li> IT WORKS!  This product actually does what it states it&#x27;s going to do.  Unfortunately, most other products do not.  Use it as directed and you will see a difference in just a few weeks.  Just ordered another set so I don&#x27;t run out.  Love love love it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use the oil, but with the base and top coat, I&#x27;ve noticed that my nails grow faster and stronger. If anything, this base adn top coat is awesome because it keeps the nail polish on the nail.</li>
    <li> Nail Tek works for my nails! Quick delivery and am very pleased! Thanks!</li>
    <li> After wearing acrylics for years my nails were in sad shape...thin and breaking very easily. I happened on Nail Tek and after reading the instructions thought this might work for me. I have now been using Nail Tek for a little over a month and my nails are now stronger and growing beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1: is the ridge filler which makes your nails smooth and pretty to the eye. I put 2 coats of the ridge filler on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2: can be using your own polish(then top coat...which comes in the kit) or just the top coat provided(I use the top coat and no polish). Each step dries within about 30 seconds and stays put even through your daily chores and wet hands...awesome staying power! I use just one coat of the top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 3: is an oil which I put on at night and rub into the nails and nail bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can now be proud of my nails...thank you Nail Tek!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I am still using this system 2 years later and am just as happy today I found NailTek. Still have great nails.</li>
    <li> The Foundation II bottle was broken when it arrived. The other 2 bottles were fine but had to return all for refund.</li>
    <li> My mother-in-law recommended this product.  It is everything she said it was.  My nails felt stronger and more healthy after the first application.  I will recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> A neighbor suggested NailTek and so my wife i trying it. Too soon to say. Will keep my mind open. Better than the $50 and month for the Nail Doctor.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really work is amazing...I am happy with this, my nails really needed.</li>
    <li> Great product...always top results!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best nail care product on the market by far.  It strengthens your nails after having fake nails removed.  It also keeps the nail bed healthy.  I&#x27;ve used it for several years and it helps my nails grow.</li>
    <li> I did not find this product to be useful in helping my nails grow. My nails grow about 1/4 inch on their own. With this product it was very small. However I will say that it helped with the peeling. I did not like the Foundation II but the oil is amazing. I will continue to use the polish until it is done and I will give it another month or more. I think I am making a rash review on it. I just recently started using the Nail Tek II on it&#x27;s own and olive oil/garlic soak treatment.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It works great on strengthening my nails.</li>
    <li> Someone recommended this to me.  It seems to be making my nails very dry and brittle. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the product for just caused by winter and dry air, but in any event, they did not grow stronger from using the product. I was disappointed to learn the product contains formaldehyde so I&#x27;m not using it anymore,</li>
    <li> Lived up to expectations!</li>
