      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything better.  </li>
      <li>and I love it</li>
      <li>and my face doesn&#x27;t break out anymore and feels healthy.</li>
      <li>I have a collection of top brand and expensive cleansers, but this is a very good product and the best for my skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is smooth and creamy and has a lovely, light scent.  </li>
      <li>This stuff I ordered is GOLD in color, smells different than what I have and does not feel in any way like the Visibly Bright cleanser I use and am very familiar with.</li>
      <li>I will absolutely keep buying this, and I hope Neutrogena comes out with an entire Visibly Bright line!</li>
      <li>Really brightens up the skin giving a lovely youthful glow.</li>
      <li>I have been a loyal neutrogena customer.</li>
      <li>It has just the right balance of squeaky clean to not overly drying.</li>
      <li>I have noticed a difference in my skin and received compliments, and the changes occurred within the first week or so of use!</li>
      <li>so I find that I don&#x27;t need a whole pump to clean my face.</li>
      <li>I had a little sample of this and fell in love with it and had to buy more.</li>
      <li>So, this has been the best facial cleanser I have found in a few years.</li>
      <li>Very gentle on the skin.  </li>
      <li>MY FACE LOOKS CLEAN AND CLEAR WITHOUT REDNESS</li>
      <li>I have sensitive, combination skin with mild roseacea.</li>
      <li>Can easily get into your mouth causing a gross taste (hence the 4 stars).</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really need a whole pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since adding this to my regime my skin has cleared and the tone is evening out, though I also use a brightening moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m very picky), this one own&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
      <li>Gotta say, this product really does leave your face feeling refreshed and energized.</li>
      <li>It makes a great morning face wash to wake you up and rejuvenate that tired look before my morning coffee.</li>
      <li>After purchasing the full-size product and using it for a couple of weeks, I look refreshed, and friends keep asking me how I look so fantastic, especially after just having a baby.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t take a chance on this happening again and Neutrogena has lost me as a customer - there are too many other options on the shelves to struggle with packaging.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Visibly Bright Facial Cleanser for a few years.  </li>
      <li>This facial cleanser is very easy on my skin and doesnt dry it out.</li>
      <li>It keeps my acne at bay with the lemon extract, a natural AHA for skin renewal and Vitamin C from the orange extract.</li>
      <li>does even out skin tone and leaves skin soft, yet not oily.</li>
      <li>After using this product for just a few days I noticed a true difference in both the vibrancy of my skin and its texture.  </li>
      <li>As a new mom, I&#x27;m slightly obsessed with brightening skin and eye products to make sure I don&#x27;t look like a zombie.</li>

<li> but it&#x27;s been a long time (my teens) since I was a dedicated follower.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is the best facial wash I have ever used.  It is smooth and creamy and has a lovely, light scent.  I have gone through several bottles and just ordered ore.</li>
    <li> Love it  does a good job. ..use to get it in Walmart but couldn’t d find it for a while</li>
    <li> MY FACE LOOKS CLEAN AND CLEAR WITHOUT REDNESS I HAVE PASSED THE PRODUCT ON TO MY FRIENDS.THEY NEED TO HAVE A MOISTURIZER THAT MATCHES THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I bought this cleanser just to give it a try and quite happy that I did. It keeps my acne at bay with the lemon extract, a natural AHA for skin renewal and Vitamin C from the orange extract. It smells like oranges and looks like liquid gold. It&#x27;s a thick formula so I find that I don&#x27;t need a whole pump to clean my face.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this cleanser. It promises results in four days, and my deluxe sample lasted seven days. As a new mom, I&#x27;m slightly obsessed with brightening skin and eye products to make sure I don&#x27;t look like a zombie. Within a couple of days of using this, I looked like I got ten hours of sleep instead of four. After purchasing the full-size product and using it for a couple of weeks, I look refreshed, and friends keep asking me how I look so fantastic, especially after just having a baby. I will absolutely keep buying this, and I hope Neutrogena comes out with an entire Visibly Bright line! (Keep in mind that I have combination skin; if you have very dry skin, you may want something creamier.)</li>
    <li> Recently obsessed with brightening products. Have always loved Neutrogena but it&#x27;s been a long time (my teens) since I was a dedicated follower.  I&#x27;m 49.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is awesome. The look and texture is a gel, but on the face is feels and foams like a cream. I don&#x27;t really need a whole pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since adding this to my regime my skin has cleared and the tone is evening out, though I also use a brightening moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be buying this again, and I may get the cream (tube) for travel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Neutrogena for years and this cleanser is my favorite!  The scent is wonderful and my skin has never looked better.</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser and the price is great too!</li>
    <li> Love this product. It works well on my skin and I did not have any allergic reaction to the product. I have been a loyal neutrogena customer.</li>
    <li> The design of this pump bottle is flawed and it doesn&#x27;t click open, no matter how hard I (and others) try.  I assumed I had a bad bottle, but did a little research to find this complaint has been lodged repeatedly against Neutrogena.  Over and over again, consumers report that the pump is flawed and can&#x27;t be clicked into a pumping position.  Why don&#x27;t they fix this design problem?  Even if this is a one-in-100 issue, the pump should be redesigned.  I like the cleanser, but don&#x27;t like having to drip the contents of the bottle all over my sink to get a usuable amount on my hand.  I won&#x27;t take a chance on this happening again and Neutrogena has lost me as a customer - there are too many other options on the shelves to struggle with packaging.</li>
    <li> Great product. Very gentle on the skin.  Amazing results.</li>
    <li> Love the way this cleans the skin and has a pleasant smell to boot. Can easily get into your mouth causing a gross taste (hence the 4 stars). I have noticed a difference in my skin and received compliments, and the changes occurred within the first week or so of use!</li>
    <li> I have been using this cleanser for some time now and I love it but it&#x27;s been hard to find at stores close to home. I ordered this package from Pharmapacks and was quite shocked at what arrived at my door. It&#x27;s like someone took out the contents and added some fake stuff. I have a bottle at home that I bought at the store and the color is white and the cleanser leaves a tingling sensation on the skin. This stuff I ordered is GOLD in color, smells different than what I have and does not feel in any way like the Visibly Bright cleanser I use and am very familiar with. It&#x27;s like someone put some fake stuff in this bottle and sold it to me. I&#x27;m horrified.</li>
    <li> This product thoroughly cleans your face of the day&#x27;s debris and makeup without irritation.  The scent is citrus in nature, but not over powering.  While one may be skeptical of the &amp;#34;visibly bright&amp;#34; claims, they are true.  After using this product for just a few days I noticed a true difference in both the vibrancy of my skin and its texture.  If you have a hard time finding a face cleanser (I&#x27;m very picky), this one own&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> Gotta say, this product really does leave your face feeling refreshed and energized. It makes a great morning face wash to wake you up and rejuvenate that tired look before my morning coffee. Have recommended to friends and those who have tried it agree that it is a quality product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Visibly Bright Facial Cleanser for a few years.  I haven&#x27;t found anything better.  It not only cleans your face but it brightens it.  I&#x27;m allergic to a lot of fragrances.  This one is perfect with a mild fragrance is any.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, combination skin with mild roseacea. I am getting into my 40&#x27;s and noticing changes I don&#x27;t like. So, this has been the best facial cleanser I have found in a few years. It has just the right balance of squeaky clean to not overly drying. I have been using it about a month now and my face doesn&#x27;t break out anymore and feels healthy.</li>
    <li> I have a collection of top brand and expensive cleansers, but this is a very good product and the best for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It does even out skin tone and leaves skin soft, yet not oily. I mix it with an exfoliator twice a week and I am very happy with the results. Also this is a great buy.</li>
    <li> I had a little sample of this and fell in love with it and had to buy more. This facial cleanser is very easy on my skin and doesnt dry it out. After about 2 weeks or so, everyone else noticed my skin was mush broghter. I dunno, maybe its becasue I see the samething in the mirror, I didnt notice a change in brightness. But its nice and easy on my skin and it smells great. And the texture of my skin however has gotten smoother.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin refreshed and smells great!</li>
    <li> It cleans well and doesn&#x27;t dry out one&#x27;s skin but the smell, while not unpleasant, stays behind and is cloying. It would have gotten four stars is it were unscented.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Love it! Really brightens up the skin giving a lovely youthful glow.</li>
