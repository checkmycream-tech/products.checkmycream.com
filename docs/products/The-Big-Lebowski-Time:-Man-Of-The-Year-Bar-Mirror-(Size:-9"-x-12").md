      <li>People will love it and it looks good in pics.</li>
      <li>Cool piece, a bit cheap in quality, but a great novelty gift</li>
      <li>That said, if you&#x27;re a fan of the movie and want a humorous conversation piece, it&#x27;ll do.</li>
      <li>YES :)  </li>
      <li>Great wall decoration, it really ties the room together.</li>
      <li>Maybe more money than i would have preferred to spend</li>
      <li>, well they think its just another one of my many achievements and awards.</li>
      <li>Frame is kind of cheap</li>
      <li>We loved the movie, and this fits just right.  </li>
      <li>So funny and a good price.</li>
      <li>Its a nice size mirror, Not crazy about plastic frame but a person can always change it.</li>
      <li>Other than that, the product looks great!  </li>
      <li>Just remember as you put on your drug-rug and sweat pants, strong men also cry...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fairly large, which was a nice surprise as well.</li>
      <li>The frame is cheap plastic that is almost flimsy to the touch.</li>
      <li>Both my father &amp; father-in-law love The Big Lebowski, and they loved this mirror.  </li>
      <li>I think any true Lebowski fan would enjoy this product.</li>
      <li>The frame is not the best quality - very obviously plastic, no attempt at looking like a major award.  </li>
      <li>, so I recently bought one for his birthday, he loved it...</li>
      <li>and I love that I could get him something that makes him smile almost as much as I do.</li>
      <li>Amazingly funny!</li>
      <li>I loved this so much, I ordered a larger one for my husband and this is for my son.</li>
      <li>I hang this right in with all my achievements awards, I tell my guests to inspect them, YES</li>
      <li>I got it with 2 day shipping prime, so it came fast!</li>
      <li>This should be the first thing you look into every day once you wake up.  </li>
      <li>This is what happens when you&#x27;ve had too many beers, watch &amp;#34;The Big Lebowski&amp;#34;, and have the Amazon app on your phone.</li>
      <li>While yes the red border does go all the way out to the frame in the movie, I think most Lebowski lovers would still appreciate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But still, I open the box and it&#x27;s way more &amp;</li>
      <li>REALLY ties my room together, man.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s very legit otherwise.</li>
      <li>complaints really.</li>
      <li>It really tied the room together.</li>
      <li>This is a cheap (not cheap) knockoff but still cool.</li>
      <li>This is an awesome collectible item for any Big Lebowski fan.</li>
      <li>I REALLY feel like I&#x27;m a young Lebowski Achiever when I look into this piece.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend absolutely loves it, and we both laugh every single time he looks in the mirror.</li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s a small wire loop at the top).</li>
      <li>Its a little smaller than I though it was going to be, and the frame is very cheap.</li>
      <li>But other than that it&#x27;s a pretty straight forward product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little cheap looking, and I could have done without the &amp;#34;Are</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little cheap feeling.</li>
      <li>I know a lot of people were unhappy with the loop on top and the cheap frame.</li>
      <li>If you have a Big Lebowski fan in your life, you really need to give this as a gift.  </li>
      <li>so the joke is more subtle.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Still, a fun little addition to my barroom.</li>
      <li>Not quite as large as I expected, but I guess that&#x27;s generally the size of a magazine...</li>
      <li>Though, if you&#x27;re looking for collectibles or you&#x27;re like a guru of the film, you might want a more expensive, high quality version.</li>
      <li>The movie is fantastic, and this is such a subtle prop--</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very cheap plastic, and the way it&#x27;s mounted to a wall is lame.</li>
      <li>True, it&#x27;s not an expensive, high quality one, but it&#x27;s nothing especially horrid</li>

    <li> If you have a Big Lebowski fan in your life, you really need to give this as a gift.  My stepson got this from my husband, and loved it.  It&#x27;s well made, large, and perfect for the Dude in your life!</li>
    <li> It really tied the room together.</li>
    <li> As described, ordered for my boss! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I REALLY feel like I&#x27;m a young Lebowski Achiever when I look into this piece. -It REALLY ties my room together, man.</li>
    <li> Nice,great,perfect....</li>
    <li> Cool piece, a bit cheap in quality, but a great novelty gift</li>
    <li> The frame is cheap plastic that is almost flimsy to the touch. The mirror part is nice. I think i might reframe it.</li>
    <li> This is a cheap (not cheap) knockoff but still cool.</li>
    <li> Depending on your mood that day, you can either look into this mirror wearing a suit and feel like the Big Lebowski, or you can look into this mirror with disdain and confusion, just like the Dude, wondering who&#x27;s pretentious house you&#x27;re in.  Just remember as you put on your drug-rug and sweat pants, strong men also cry...</li>
    <li> Xmas gift for my father, he loved it and got a kick out of it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little cheap feeling. Plastic frame, but it&#x27;s very legit otherwise. People will love it and it looks good in pics.</li>
    <li> Not quite as large as I expected, but I guess that&#x27;s generally the size of a magazine... Other than that, the product looks great!  On top of that, the customer service was excellent.</li>
    <li> Now I can contemplate nihilism while I shamelessly indulge my narcissism.</li>
    <li> Yeah, I know that the size is provided on the listing. But still, I open the box and it&#x27;s way more &amp;#34;little Lebowski&amp;#34; than I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, a fun little addition to my barroom.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little cheap looking, and I could have done without the &amp;#34;Are you a Lebowski Achiever&amp;#34; ribbon on the bottom so the joke is more subtle. That said, if you&#x27;re a fan of the movie and want a humorous conversation piece, it&#x27;ll do.</li>
    <li> Got it for my boyfriends&#x27; dad for his birthday, he got a kick out of it! So funny and a good price.</li>
    <li> for when you are engaged in an all out nerd war</li>
    <li> Its a nice size mirror, Not crazy about plastic frame but a person can always change it. We loved the movie, and this fits just right.  I had purchased this for my husband, and it hangs in to living room.  Our oldest son, who lives in another city, when he comes home, he looks in the mirror &amp; just smiles.  It quite a conservation piece, so I recently bought one for his birthday, he loved it...He said he is going to put in his work office! I got it with 2 day shipping prime, so it came fast!</li>
    <li> This is so perfect for my office AND my home. EVERYONE who sees it (and has seen &amp;#34;The Big Lebowski) laughs and loves it. They always ask where I got it. Total attention-grabber. This has got to be one of the best gifts for a fan.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
    <li> This is what happens when you&#x27;ve had too many beers, watch &amp;#34;The Big Lebowski&amp;#34;, and have the Amazon app on your phone. Good purchase!</li>
    <li> Kind of flimsy, but it does the trick. Made my buddy happy.</li>
    <li> I have been waiting five years to surprise my fiance with this mirror. It was not a surprise after all. However, He loves it and I love that I could get him something that makes him smile almost as much as I do.</li>
    <li> Nice product.  A little smaller than expected.</li>
    <li> Amazingly funny! Good quality for a novelty. Great gift for the Lebwoski fan.</li>
    <li> This should be the first thing you look into every day once you wake up.  Are you a Lebowski achiever?</li>
    <li> Frame is kind of cheap</li>
    <li> I loved this so much, I ordered a larger one for my husband and this is for my son. The mirror is really cool and the idea of being the &amp;#34;Man of the Year&amp;#34; is a hoot and going on the wall of my husband&#x27;s mancave!!!</li>
    <li> Its a little smaller than I though it was going to be, and the frame is very cheap. But other than that it&#x27;s a pretty straight forward product.</li>

    <li> My son was absolutely delighted with this mirror on Christmas morning.  It is a must have for any Lebowski fan.</li>
    <li> The frame is not the best quality - very obviously plastic, no attempt at looking like a major award.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a quality item.</li>
    <li> The quality might not be the greatest but the mirror came intact and as described. Maybe more money than i would have preferred to spend but it was a gift and the gift receiver loves it! I think any true Lebowski fan would enjoy this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very cheap plastic, and the way it&#x27;s mounted to a wall is lame. Feels like something you&#x27;d buy at Walmart. I wanted this thing really bad though so I bought it, but I do have a slight bit of regret. The movie is fantastic, and this is such a subtle prop-- it&#x27;s a shame it wasn&#x27;t put to $26 quality.</li>
    <li> Plastic brown frame, with painted mirror. I hang this right in with all my achievements awards, I tell my guests to inspect them, YES YES :)  They see the TIME mirror and I  get a few smiles from the ones who have seen the movie, and the ones who haven&#x27;t seen the movie, well they think its just another one of my many achievements and awards.</li>
    <li> Both my father &amp; father-in-law love The Big Lebowski, and they loved this mirror.  It&#x27;s fairly large, which was a nice surprise as well.</li>
    <li> Hah hah! This thing is great! I got it as a gift for a friend and everyone that&#x27;s seen it has loved it. I would definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints really. I know a lot of people were unhappy with the loop on top and the cheap frame. When I received it, I thought the loop was hardly noticeable (it&#x27;s a small wire loop at the top). For my purposes at least, it didn&#x27;t really do anything to ruin the frame. Also, The frame is like an ordinary plastic frame. True, it&#x27;s not an expensive, high quality one, but it&#x27;s nothing especially horrid (I didn&#x27;t think so). While yes the red border does go all the way out to the frame in the movie, I think most Lebowski lovers would still appreciate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say, if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap gift that someone will appreciate for the humor, this is perfect. Though, if you&#x27;re looking for collectibles or you&#x27;re like a guru of the film, you might want a more expensive, high quality version.</li>
    <li> Great wall decoration, it really ties the room together.</li>
    <li> Small scratches in the middle of the glass. Oh well, didn&#x27;t take the time to repackage and ship back.</li>
