<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Used on my whole face this product stays very greasy and shiny, covers nothing  and breaks me out horribly. I decided to try it as an under eye concealer since I ran out of my regular one and I love it. My milia have greatly diminished and my under eyes seems much younger looking and moisturized! not to mention it&#x27;s spf 45 :) I upped my lippies from 1 to 3 since I still would not use it on my whole face ever again.</li>
    <li> This is a great wrinkle, cream sunscreen and light coverup.</li>
    <li> It is a little too light and more of a make up base. I like the one that is tinted but can fit any skin type. I will have to try some of the other products you offer in the tinted moisturizer but I do like the revision itellishade tinted moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Love the natural combination with my skin complexion while is a sunscreen.It does not dry my skin out. The reason I give 4 stars is that I noticed it did not protect dark spot well so I have to apply extra higher SPF sunscreen before I use it. The deliver was quick and package was wrapped professionally.</li>
    <li> Good product, but a bit too expensive</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product.  Even coverage that makes you look great. I do use a primer underneath but You don&#x27;t really have to be concerned about the color like some other brands. I&#x27;ve ordered others, paid for the name and what I expected from that name only to be disappointed. I wasted my money. You will NOT feel that way with this makeup!!!  I know better now and do not plan to buy anything else.</li>
    <li> The best tinted sunscreen for your face.  Evens skin tone and moisturizes too.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use make-up and this acts as both a sunscreen and foundation. It&#x27;s a bit on the expensive side but since only a little is required to apply, it lasts longer.  I love this product and would recommend it to everyone. My dermatologist recommended this for me.</li>
    <li> Perfect and arrived timely.</li>
    <li> It blends well and adjusts to match my skin tone. This works much better than the tinted moisturizer I used to use from one of the big name cosmetic companies in the department stores.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good not great, I have to use some type of moisturizer under it, even throw this is a tinted moisturizer.  I might need to play with it a bit more, still not sure.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, a personal favorite.</li>
    <li> Very nice product, looks good too.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Revision Intellishade.  It has a creamy and &amp;#34;dewey&amp;#34; finish.  Would not be without it.  Use it daily.</li>
    <li> Lovel feel and finish for a tinted moisturizer.  Does not &amp;#34;adjust&amp;#34; when I have any sort of tan so I reserve this for fall and winter.</li>
    <li> Great tinted moisturizer I would recommend for those with dry skin.</li>
    <li> Love this.. always a great buy. Gives the face and chest a great smooth look and works for whatever color of skin is due to season.</li>
    <li> Great protection and light cover.  Perfect</li>
    <li> love the full coverage SPF</li>
    <li> Color very natural . Gives skin a glow without heavy makeup look.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist, and it is excellent. You don&#x27;t have to use additional makeup, but sometimes I do.</li>
    <li> My wife is a fair skinned redhead and loves the product. It provides the needed protection and she loves the shade.</li>
    <li> great product. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I love the product, especially with the 45 sun screen.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> easy to use.  coverage good.  use right over your daily moisturizer for extra protection.&lt;br /&gt;i would not hesitate to order  it again.</li>
    <li> hard to find item ., great product for my dry skin. very fast shipping  love the spf 45 ., don&#x27;t have to use sunscreen with this makeup.</li>
    <li> Dermatologist recommended.  Love how it adjust to my skin tone and enhances it.  No need for foundation. .</li>
    <li> This product combines moisturizer, sunscreen and foundation in one tube.  I was skeptical about it matching my skin tone but it is perfect.</li>
    <li> This is a great sun blocker with just a little tint that blends so smoothly on your face. It also gives a little extra moisturizer</li>
    <li> Perfect, just as listed.</li>
    <li> I like Revision Intellishade because I can leave the house protected and it gives me a nice even skin tone without having to be fully made up.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is you really have to be careful not to get in in your eyes because it will burn.  If you put this on like your foundation be very careful of the eye area.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. Great SPF and light coverage for daily use.</li>
    <li> Im a fan of revision line of facial/neck creams. I used this plus their eye cream and neck cream. I am also a 59 year old woma who wants to minimize fine lines and even out skin tone..this product does that. And if you want an amazing neck cream..get their nectify..this makes a huge diferenc on the neck. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Adjusts to my skin tone. Can use it all year long no matter how tan I get. My dermatologist approved it too.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t say enough good things about this</li>
    <li> Amazing!  This moisturizer not only keeps my face moist it protects my skin from the sun.  It also acts as a makeup.  I don&#x27;t wear makeup so I depend on these tinted moisturizers to to their trick.  Since I have been starting to use this product, I get at least one complement a day how wonderful my skin looks.  I really think it has better coverage then makeup and it looks very natural.  I went for the matt finish.  Less shinny.</li>
    <li> I found this foundation to match my skin color perfectly. I don&#x27;t feel like I have makeup on at all.</li>
    <li> Great coverage and moisture.  I no longer use foundation and just put my blush and eye makeup right after this.  SPF 45 is awesome!</li>
    <li> Love it.  The cream is a good moisturizer and provides me enough coverage that I don&#x27;t  need foundation.  Try. It.</li>
    <li> Great product. Wish it came in some darker shades for Summer, but great for tennis court or golf course.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I have used a few different sunscreen but this is the best for me.</li>
    <li> This was highly recomended to me and since I started using (every day) whether I go out or not, when I do go out, I put on top a heavier make-up, but his is the greatest protection, has kept me from getting age spots and has diminish a bit the ones I had.</li>
    <li> I like this product as it blends with my complexion without looking heavy and fake.  Have been using it for several years.</li>
    <li> Love the no make-up look and the way ot evens skin tone</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the product. It was more effective than the popular brand (Jergens). It&#x27;s pricey, but good.</li>
    <li> Received as promised in good condition.</li>
    <li> Very good service.  Good product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this tinted sunscreen for several years, and like that it eliminates the need for face makeup.  Not only does it protect, but it blends easily and appears very natural. Very little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Perhaps one of the best coverage/moisturizing creams on the market.....especially like the SPF factor.  I&#x27;m and &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; girl with a bit of sun damage that this covers very well.  So...my advice to you younger girls who are going to go out in the sun regardless of its hazards....start using this everyday and avoid those dark spots that develop over years of too much sun exposure.  A GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I never wore any type of foundation until I tried this and I absolutely love it.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing a mask, and I&#x27;ve received lots of compliments on my appearance.  Now I &amp;#34;don&#x27;t leave home without it.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. It was recommended by my dermatologist. It has a 45 SPF and helps to prevent new sun spots.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for 3 years and love it.</li>
    <li> wonderful product. delivered within a few days.</li>
    <li> Loved it and appreciate the quickness in receiving the product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product</li>
    <li> Love it and so do my clients!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Using this instead of foundation.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I like a more natural look and this product serves me well.</li>
    <li> It is good for mature skin as it does not emphasize wrinkles.  It is also a good sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time with lotions and sunscreens since I tend to break out after using them.  I had no issues with this lotion.  The few times I wore it alone (without makeup), people commented on how nice my skin looked.  I definitely will purchase this again.  Great moisturizer and sun protection combined in one!</li>
    <li> Recommended by everyone that uses it. My family loves it</li>
    <li> Love this product!  It makes my skin look flawless and radiant.  Try it!</li>
    <li> used this product for many years and really like it</li>
    <li> This a great product, love it..</li>
    <li> Best product for any woman&#x27;s skin. Use it every day!</li>
    <li> This is the same product that I get from my dermatologist and I can save money. It&#x27;s a win-win for me.  If you are concerned about expiration, the product has a stamped expiration date on the bottom side of the tube. I have not gotten one that is past the expiration date. If it has expired, you should be able to return it.</li>
    <li> Great product and vendor.</li>
