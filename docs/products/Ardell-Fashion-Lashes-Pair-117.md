      <li>to all those reading this review right now, try these now!</li>
      <li>They look natural when they are one and the length is amazing.</li>
      <li>Therefore they don&#x27;t look as full.</li>
      <li>But both are good for regular use.</li>
      <li>My first time tried them on, I was so thrilled and came back to amazon to get more.</li>
      <li>These are very easy to put on and almost too natural looking.</li>
      <li>They look natural and apply very easily.</li>
      <li>If you want a little daytime drama, these are great without being overstated.</li>
      <li>Loved my eyelashes a good size for casual events</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this number , they are good for both day and evening wear with a little bit more mascara , and you can reuse them numerous times if you take them off properly</li>
      <li>I prefer 105, which I wear daily.&lt;br /&gt;They are similar, but the 117 has a littler more space in between each lash.</li>
      <li>If the inner and outer corners were shorter then they might have been okay.</li>
      <li>Great lashes that you can use at least 3 times if you do not use too much glue!</li>
      <li>I always get these lashes because theyre easy to use and the glue dries clear and they come off when you&#x27;re ready to take them off no problem.</li>
      <li>Full natural look</li>
      <li>If you use oil free eye make up remover to clean it every night, and put it back to the container to keep its nice shape, each set last for a very long time.</li>
      <li>they are very thick and drastic but overall very beautiful</li>
      <li>Very inexpensive and got a bunch.</li>
      <li>It does work great as a practice tool for those who want to learn how to apply false lashes on people.</li>
      <li>I wear false lashes daily and have found these to be the best.</li>
      <li>I think i like other numbers better</li>
      <li>looks pretty natural too!</li>
      <li>Absolutely beautiful dramatic but natural looking lashes</li>
      <li>They are too light and not dark enough.  </li>
      <li>It clearly says Pack of 4</li>
      <li>Looks natural.  </li>
      <li>But I got the natural lashes instead of the fashion lashes.</li>
      <li>I like the length and the natural look but the white glue stands out.</li>
      <li>I may try something more dramatic when going out</li>
      <li>A little too much for the day though</li>
      <li>Other than being a teeny bit overlong, these lashes look very natural and hold up for weeks (if you remove them properly) before you have to toss them.</li>

    <li> These are good lashes. I wanted to give these a try and see how they compare to 105. I prefer 105, which I wear daily.&lt;br /&gt;They are similar, but the 117 has a littler more space in between each lash. Therefore they don&#x27;t look as full. But both are good for regular use.

    <li> I liked them very much but prefer  their Glamour ones.</li>
    <li> Absolutely beautiful dramatic but natural looking lashes</li>
    <li> My sister has been wearing these lashes for more than 5 years and she loves them. Not too long, but full and the perfect width. I bought these as a gift for her, that is why I&#x27;m writing the review. She would definitely recommend this product. P.S. if you use a toothpick to apply the glue to the lashes, you get a perfect line and no globs.</li>
    <li> I am subscribed to these lashes , I have nothing bad to say about them . They are the perfect size , I never have to had to cut them down . I absolutely love this number , they are good for both day and evening wear with a little bit more mascara , and you can reuse them numerous times if you take them off properly</li>
    <li> Other than being a teeny bit overlong, these lashes look very natural and hold up for weeks (if you remove them properly) before you have to toss them. If you want a little daytime drama, these are great without being overstated.</li>
