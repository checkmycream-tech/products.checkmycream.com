<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Leaves hair very shiny,  but also very crunchy.  Not a big fan.</li>
    <li> This custard is perfect at defining my 4a 4b 4c combination curls I just can&#x27;t stand the smell so for that reason I will not repurchase plus when the product arrived it was opened from this vendor</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have been natural for 2 years and have tried so many products that just didn&#x27;t work.  Finally a company that got it right. I&#x27;ve read the reviews and I think the reason it&#x27;s not working for some people is that you have to follow the directions precisely.  Also it helps if your is naturally curly which is my texture. I&#x27;m a 3C.  I know this a good product because the product is thick and my hair still loves this product.  My hair is fine &amp; tends to get weighed down easily but my hair soaks this up. Results are amazing.  Full, lovely shiny, defined curls. Couldn&#x27;t believe it. It was like some magic.  My curls popped and were beautifully elongated which I never had before. I washed with Shea Moisture,  moisture retention shampoo, followed by the Avlon Natural Texture Leave In conditioner.  Applied generously to my wet hair and detangled as instructed and the next step which is crucial is to apply in small sections while SOAKING wet and the then I finger styled. I did use a lot of the custard but the next day I stilled used a lot of the conditioner but here is the key. I only used a small amount of the custard while my hair was SOAKING wet again. You can&#x27;t just spritz that&#x27;s a joke.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot everyday.  Its the SOAKING wet that is the key. It works well for wash and go. I didn&#x27;t buy the products from amazon.  I got mine from a local small beauty supply store. This stuff is hard to find. It may not be as popular anymore but I love it. Everyone&#x27;s hair texture is different.  What works for me may not work for someone else.  The price here is good because it is expensive.  I paid $15.50 for the custard &amp; $12.50 for the conditioner. Only cons are I don&#x27;t like having to soak my hair everyday especially in the winter. This product is better for summertime. Also there is no flakiness. I love the smell, it doesn&#x27;t bother me. It is very strong &amp; perfumey. More of a citrus smell. So inclusion I&#x27;m giving this only 4 stars for the price &amp; for itrequiring your hair to be soaking wet.</li>
    <li> This is the best, hardly any frizz, structured yet flexible curls. I&#x27;m obsessed with it.</li>
    <li> This product went on great; however, when I reached up to scratch an itch in my scalp, a weird thing happened and a lot of flaking occurred.  In fact, my hair resembled the icing on a glazed donut about to flake off which could be embarrassing when out in public because I would not want to give the appearance of having severe dandruff.  I actually prefer the Keracare Twists and Defining Cream made by Avlon.</li>
    <li> works great my daughter love this stuff</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a custard that actually brought out the natiral curl of my hair without being gumpy or gooey or flaky when dry, and this is IT!! This custard goes on smooth, so you do not need gobs of it to get the job done. I found that creating small sections of hair, then applying by raking my coated fingers through my hair did the trick. I love the soft and shiny curls it creates and it lasts a few days, just spritz to re activate and you are good to go.</li>
    <li> This stuff flakes very badly and I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product. The smell is very strong and  medicinal to me. I will not be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> Like the texture &amp; feel of this products.  Goes on so smooth, but when it dries it leaves a white residue</li>
    <li> makes my curls look good :)</li>
    <li> This product is thick and heavy. It has a very strong smell that I couldn&#x27;t wash out fast enough. It did offer control. However, I would not use it again or recommend it. When I questioned the manufacturer about the odor their response was to ask me where I purchased it, inferring that the fragrance was caused by the product not being sold by a reputable supplier. I&#x27;ve purchased many products online without a problem, and doubt this to be true but who knows?</li>
    <li> This curl cream is amazing. It clumps my curls nicely and it dries pretty fast. There was no left over residue. I love it.</li>
    <li> i use this with the other Avlon products and it&#x27;s brings ahhmazing results my hair grew, it&#x27;s curly and soft it doesn&#x27;t flake and best of all it only cost me a little over $11 where i&#x27;m located my local hair store tried to charge me $40 for one small container.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair flaky... I don&#x27;t like it...</li>
    <li> Finally had a successful twist out!  I originally brought this for my wash n&#x27; goes and it actually is like magic.  I just hate my small coils and very short hair but this product, instantly defines your curls and leaves a beautiful shine.  I used the Shampoo, conditioner, leave-in and this defining custard.  They all worked beautifully together.  I finally realizing also that using a complete line of a product will provide better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a mini-two strand twist with this custard and they came out AMAZING!!!!!  I&#x27;m on day 3 and my hair has hold, shine and beautiful curls.  So I will definitely be sticking with this product line.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff for natural hair, oh how I love this stuff</li>
    <li> Leaves my curls beautifully defined</li>
    <li> The Keracare Defining Custard did not leave my hair crunchy like some other gels, BUT there was a bit of flaking after it dried.  I used a leave-in conditioner and I&#x27;m hoping that&#x27;s the reason for the flaking.  I will give it another try without the leave-in conditioner.</li>
