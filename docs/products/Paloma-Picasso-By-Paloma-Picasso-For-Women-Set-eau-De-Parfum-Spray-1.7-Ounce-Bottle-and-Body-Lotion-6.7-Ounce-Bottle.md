    <li> I purchased for my Mother and she loves this fragrance. Smells awesome</li>
    <li> ....my favorite wintertime smell....  :)</li>
    <li> My mother-in-law loves this perfume and we buy it for her every year at Christmas.  If we buy this combo at the department store we pay around $75.  When I found this at Amazon, I was a bit skepticle because the price was so good.  I thought once we received it the size of the perfume and lotion would be smaller than what we purchase at the department store.  But when we received it, we were so excited to see it was the exact same item we have previously purchased, but at almost half the price.  FABULOUS!!!!</li>
    <li> Received on time.great value</li>
    <li> My aunt&#x27;s favorite fragrance and was easy to find</li>
    <li> I thought the set would come in a box, like what is pictured but instead came in clear plastic bag. Perfume &amp; lotion were as described and the shipping was EXTREMELY fast! Thanks for the quick shipping!</li>
    <li> My friend loved this gift set. She has been wearing this perfume for years and it was a nice surprise for her.</li>
    <li> I have always loved the fragrance of this perfume.  I was looking around for just the perfume and lotion and I found it here at a very reasonable price.  Quick delivery also.</li>
    <li> I have a very hard time finding perfume that stays with me.  I think it is one of the nicest compliments a woman can get...&amp;#34;you smell nice&amp;#34;.  What a deal...lotion and perfume together.</li>
    <li> Just what my lady wanted!!</li>
    <li> Had picked up a sample hand lotion while on vacation.&lt;br /&gt;Could never find this perfume, till I looked for it ON LINE. It is a little heavy, but want to smell what I wear. Not some weak smell.&lt;br /&gt;The wrapping was unusual to say the least, but the order was perfect when opened. Looked like it had come from an upscale dept. store. Recommend the Seller.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Not too heavy but a light clean scent.</li>
    <li> Awesome to find my mom&#x27;s favorite perfume on here! Seller got product to us on time and was a great value for the price. Appreciate how easy it was to purchase. My mom was very happy with her gift! Will continue to buy this product (and possibly others) through this seller.</li>
    <li> She has loved it since it came first out.  It is womanly, somewhat sophisticated, noticeable but not overwhelming. People always ask her what the fragrance is, even when just using the lotion --it lasts and lasts.</li>
    <li> Every now and then I like to buy Paloma and I like to buy it with the body cream because it is just lovely. Just as promised.</li>
    <li> has always been my fav. frag.!</li>
    <li> Ihave been wearing this scent for years and years. Best price I have found for the product is AMAZON.  I get great compliments.</li>
    <li> Purchased for mom as a gift and she loved it.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this scent for the past 20 years, and almost daily I receive compliments from people, including complete strangers - both men and women.

    <li> I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY VERY SPECIAL AUNT. IT SMELT SO GOOD ON HER AND SHE JUST LOVED IT SO MUCH SO I KEPT HER STOCKED UP. AFTER MY LAST PURCHASED SHE DIDN&#x27;T GET TO RECEIVE IT DUE TO THE FACT SHE PAST AWAY A FEW DAYS BEFORE. BUT I DO RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE THAT WANTS TO STAND OUT AND GET A LOT OF GREAT COMMENTS.</li>
    <li> my favorite perfume for the last 20 years.  I used to be able to purchase this item  at Macys but now they don&#x27;t sell it any  more...thank you Amazon</li>

    <li> it&#x27;s one of my favorite fragrances.  To me it smells lavenderie,musky which is an acceptable smell to the patients I see everyday in a really busy ER.  One tiny, tiny squirt is all that&#x27;s needed to last all shift.</li>
