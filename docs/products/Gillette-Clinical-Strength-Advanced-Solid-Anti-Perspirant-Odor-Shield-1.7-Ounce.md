      <li>Gillette clinical odor shield is by far the best smelling and performing deodorant I have ever owned</li>
      <li>better</li>
      <li>Make sure you put it on before going to bed.</li>
      <li>It works flawlessly until the next evening when I put it on again.  </li>
      <li>If you do that, you&#x27;d have to put the deodorant on immediately after drying yourself (while your pores are still open) for the best results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works much better that way than when you put it on in the morning.</li>
      <li>After I read all the comments on this product, I was excited, so I bought it.</li>
      <li>Let me say…it was love at first use.  </li>
      <li>I have tried a lot of different deodorants and this one work the best so far</li>
      <li>Wow, another one of those products that I tend to purchase the cost more than anything else!</li>
      <li>It keeps you dry, and just as importantly has a nice clean smell that doesn&#x27;t overpower.</li>
      <li>This is the only kind of deoderant I use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried various other kinds of deodorants, and this one works the best.</li>
      <li>Husband has used it before and he loved the way it worked, but when we got this the knob at the bottom to bring the deodorant to the top was broken off so we couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
      <li>Even if you&#x27;re wearing an A-shirt and even if you&#x27;re hot, people probably won&#x27;t smell the deodorant unless their head is on your shoulder or something.</li>
      <li>in all, my favorite brand of deodorant for its smell, efficacy and overall intended effect of making me not stink or sweat.</li>
      <li>I put it at night for the first, before bedtime</li>
      <li>during the hot AZ summers it&#x27;s a life saver.</li>
      <li>also because you have to put it on at night instead of in the morning getting ready, it eliminates that white stain issue i used to have with most of my shirts.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Using this, you only need 1-2 clicks to fully saturate your armpit with deodorant; you will smell fresh for a much longer duration than most other brands that I have tried, and the smell is more subtle, more like a soap scent or very light</li>
      <li>Pleasant smell, and this one actually keep me dry for a couple of days...  </li>
      <li>The older heads, as the above style is, have an even spacing of holes across a contoured, convex oval -- as most deodorants are shaped -- that will apply under your arm fully.</li>
      <li>though it&#x27;s really not that much more on Amazon).</li>
      <li>I have no problems with sweating through my shirts while using the Gillette clinical odor shield advanced solid antiperspirant/deodorant.</li>
      <li>You really DO need to use 3 clicks.  </li>
      <li>and she had come real close), she expressed surprise in favoring it and mistook it for cologne.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>I always used to wear the cheap stuff but its well worth the few extra bucks to smell good and be dry, even in the summer months.</li>
      <li>problem is that you will only receive 1.7 oz of deodorant, which with a push-up paste will deplete rather quickly (</li>
      <li>My housemate (a girl) has told me that she doesn&#x27;t normally like scented stuff...</li>
      <li>If you are someone who sweats a lot, then it is worth paying extra for this (</li>
      <li>, I normally take showers at the tail end of the day (like 4 hours before bed) and then put on this deodorant.  </li>
      <li>My recommendation is to stock up whenever the price is below $8, because if you&#x27;re anything like me, you&#x27;ll be buying it very frequently - a testament to the fact that it works well, but a blow to the wallet.</li>
      <li>It works and does not leave the white residue that many other do.</li>
      <li>In general, any &amp;#34;Clinical&amp;#34; strength bar is definitely worth the extra money.  </li>
      <li>However, I seem to go through this particular kind ridiculously quickly, so it has proven to be a very expensive addition to my hygiene regiment.</li>
      <li>I have switched to using this at night before bed and applying Gillette clear antiperspirant during the day.</li>
      <li>this stuff is definitely worth the extra cost over regular deodorant.</li>
      <li>What you&#x27;ll get with the Gillette Clinical brand of deodorant is a solid, aluminum-zirconium-based paste that will keep you dry and smelling like a fresh shower -- at least under your armpits -- for many hours.</li>

<li> I try and do as little shopping as possible at the stores</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette Clinical for several months now, and it definitely does the job where standard deodorants fail, especially if used twice a day.</li>
<li> Really expensive, but I would say worth it.  </li>
<li> and then when I  woke up, I notice that is was not strong enough, so</li>

<li> first, the fragrance is not good, is confused and you can tell by that when you mix it with sweat it is going to be some confusion.</li>
<li> Works decent but is hella expensive to keep up in comparison to this deodorant.</li>
<li> Only downfall is, it&#x27;s tough to wash off once applied.</li>
<li> round but</li>
<li> Even in the dead of summer</li>
<li> He usually takes deodorant with him everywhere</li>
<li> The &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; residue can be a problem on colored shirts if you put on the shirt after you put on the deodorant or at least the way I put on my shirts.  </li>
<li> /&gt;this product deserve a boooooooooo, and the worse is expensive too</li>
<li> My armpit might not drip sweat, but it will nonetheless remain moist, which is annoying since I wear from-fitted clothing that would get moist.</li>
<li> The packaging was terrible.  </li>

    <li> The packaging was terrible.  Husband has used it before and he loved the way it worked, but when we got this the knob at the bottom to bring the deodorant to the top was broken off so we couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Great anti-perspirant. It works and does not leave the white residue that many other do. Make sure you put it on before going to bed. Works much better that way than when you put it on in the morning.</li>
    <li> What you&#x27;ll get with the Gillette Clinical brand of deodorant is a solid, aluminum-zirconium-based paste that will keep you dry and smelling like a fresh shower -- at least under your armpits -- for many hours. The problem is that the newer versions have a horrendous application head, with a small circle of holes near the center of the bar to be fully applied. This causes you to waste much deodorant to apply it evenly across your skin. The older heads, as the above style is, have an even spacing of holes across a contoured, convex oval -- as most deodorants are shaped -- that will apply under your arm fully. This was preferable to me as a consumer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this, you only need 1-2 clicks to fully saturate your armpit with deodorant; you will smell fresh for a much longer duration than most other brands that I have tried, and the smell is more subtle, more like a soap scent or very light cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that you will only receive 1.7 oz of deodorant, which with a push-up paste will deplete rather quickly (around 1-1.5 months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, my favorite brand of deodorant for its smell, efficacy and overall intended effect of making me not stink or sweat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried various other kinds of deodorants, and this one works the best. Completely dry. Aside from the fact that it smells the best.  My housemate (a girl) has told me that she doesn&#x27;t normally like scented stuff... but then when she smelled this deodorant on my body (I was wearing an A-shirt and she had come real close), she expressed surprise in favoring it and mistook it for cologne.&lt;br /&gt;Now the scent isn&#x27;t too strong, which is good.  I actually prefer to wear colognes and I wouldn&#x27;t want a deodorant that would interfere.  Even if you&#x27;re wearing an A-shirt and even if you&#x27;re hot, people probably won&#x27;t smell the deodorant unless their head is on your shoulder or something. They&#x27;d smell your cologne foremost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I normally take showers at the tail end of the day (like 4 hours before bed) and then put on this deodorant.  It works flawlessly until the next evening when I put it on again.  Alternatively, sometimes I&#x27;d shower in the morning. If you do that, you&#x27;d have to put the deodorant on immediately after drying yourself (while your pores are still open) for the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH! And I made the biggest mistake for the longest time. You really DO need to use 3 clicks.  I tried getting away with 2 clicks for too long.  Although it still performs well with 2-click, you don&#x27;t get the flawless protection effect unless you notch it up to 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;Some comparisons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried sweat-be-gone. Works decent but is hella expensive to keep up in comparison to this deodorant. Also, sweatbgone still doesn&#x27;t actually make your underarm smell any *better*, so you still need to apply something&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Certain-Dri.  Stuff struggles to maintain. Works intermittently and nevertheless not fully.  My armpit might not drip sweat, but it will nonetheless remain moist, which is annoying since I wear from-fitted clothing that would get moist.</li>
    <li> After I read all the comments on this product, I was excited, so I bought it. first, the fragrance is not good, is confused and you can tell by that when you mix it with sweat it is going to be some confusion. I put it at night for the first, before bedtime and then when I  woke up, I notice that is was not strong enough, so I iook a bath put 3 clicks again and hit the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sweating my armpits during the workout. when I finished I noticed that confusion I mentioned before on my armpits, Gillette and sweat mixed. when I got home, a funky smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this product deserve a boooooooooo, and the worse is expensive too</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different deodorants and this one work the best so far plus it smells really good and that&#x27;s the cheapest price you can find.</li>
    <li> My husband likes it, that&#x27;s all that matters and  I have to buy it at the best price I can find.</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant that works for me. I&#x27;ve seen it sell for over $13 a stick at walgreens and rite aid.</li>
    <li> This is the only kind of deoderant I use. I always used to wear the cheap stuff but its well worth the few extra bucks to smell good and be dry, even in the summer months.</li>
    <li> Wow, another one of those products that I tend to purchase the cost more than anything else! Still, this stuff is almost foolproof. I am a big, rather heavy man living in the Central Florida area. Even in the dead of summer I have no problems with sweating through my shirts while using the Gillette clinical odor shield advanced solid antiperspirant/deodorant.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff.  Really expensive, but I would say worth it.  He usually takes deodorant with him everywhere he goes because he has to apply it several times a day, but not with this product!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this deodarant.  Amazon has the best price with the subscribe and save feature.  My husband goes through one a month.  He sweats alot because of his job and he never complains about having any issues with his sweat since using this and we&#x27;ve tried several of the other &amp;#34;clincal strength&amp;#34; in the men&#x27;s deodarant.  Plus, it smells great.</li>
    <li> The price and the fact I can have it shipped to me cheaper than having to go to the store and get it. I try and do as little shopping as possible at the stores</li>
    <li> Great product for reducing under arm perspiration but it leaves a white residue all over my shirts when I dress after a shower. I have switched to using this at night before bed and applying Gillette clear antiperspirant during the day. This combination works well for me.</li>
    <li> This is a great deodorant and antiperspirant.  In general, any &amp;#34;Clinical&amp;#34; strength bar is definitely worth the extra money.  I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I recently ran out of my usual deodorant and out of necessity had to use my husbands for the day.  Let me say…it was love at first use.  I typically use Secret clinical but found that this Gillette works so much better for me.  I don&#x27;t use it year round but during the hot AZ summers it&#x27;s a life saver.</li>
    <li> this stuff is definitely worth the extra cost over regular deodorant. keeps me dry when nothing else does. also because you have to put it on at night instead of in the morning getting ready, it eliminates that white stain issue i used to have with most of my shirts.</li>
    <li> An antiperspirant that actually works!  Pleasant smell, and this one actually keep me dry for a couple of days...  Only downfall is, it&#x27;s tough to wash off once applied.</li>
    <li> Gillette clinical odor shield is by far the best smelling and performing deodorant I have ever owned and I have tried a lot.</li>
    <li> Awesome deodorant. I have tried tons and this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling at the end of the day. Even other brands of Clinical strength are lacking. The best part, I get complemented on the smell of it ALL the time by females! Even asked what I am wearing. Get it! You won&#x27;t regret it. Subscribe and save is the best price I have found so far for it. (Plus a coupon if amazon has one)</li>
    <li> If you are someone who sweats a lot, then it is worth paying extra for this (though it&#x27;s really not that much more on Amazon). It keeps you dry, and just as importantly has a nice clean smell that doesn&#x27;t overpower.</li>
    <li> Ok, I don&#x27;t know what the deal is, but while the product works great it can leave a stain on your shirts.  The &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; residue can be a problem on colored shirts if you put on the shirt after you put on the deodorant or at least the way I put on my shirts.  I would recommend putting on deodorant after putting on your shirt and be-careful not to touch your shirt.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette Clinical for several months now, and it definitely does the job where standard deodorants fail, especially if used twice a day. I no longer have to worry about my deodorant underperforming or not lasting long enough. However, I seem to go through this particular kind ridiculously quickly, so it has proven to be a very expensive addition to my hygiene regiment. My recommendation is to stock up whenever the price is below $8, because if you&#x27;re anything like me, you&#x27;ll be buying it very frequently - a testament to the fact that it works well, but a blow to the wallet.</li>
