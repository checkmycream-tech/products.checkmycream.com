      <li>It leave my hair feeling soft and manageable.</li>

      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell very good though:(</li>
      <li>Good shampoo, my hair is wavy, thick and slightly frizzy.</li>

    <li> love this shampoo will never use anything else. although paul mitchell makes a sulfate free shampoo for men called Mitch Double Hitter that is exceptional as well!!</li>
    <li> I bought this during a visit to my hair dresser. I have very long dark hair that tends to be oily at the roots and very dry toward the ends because of processing in the past. I have been hearing  a lot about argon oil but was afraid it would be too oily. My hair dresser showed me the Sexy Hair Healthy Sexy Soy Renewal Argan Oil Treatment so I decided to buy it along with the matching shampoo and conditioner. I love love love this stuff!!! Seriously its like I have new hair! I did have to learn how to use the argon oil, too much can give you an oily look, not enough and you don&#x27;t get results. I only apply it to the ends and lightly over the surface just catching any fly-a ways or frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the shampoo and conditioner as normal and I immediately noticed a difference in my hair, it was so soft and healthy feeling. The best part is that a little goes a long way! My hair is down to my waist band, very thick and I wash it once or twice a week, it only takes about a silver dollar sized amount of shampoo (shampoo twice) and conditioner for all of my hair! The oil I use about a quarter size amount, rub hands together to warm and start at the ends running fingers through hair. I have healthy shiny hair that I never have to blow dry and I can just let air dry and hang natural. If I twist it in a bun right after its mostly dry, leave it overnight, in the morning I will have long ringlet curls that are shiny and super soft! I just untwist after I get to the office and gently run my fingers through to separate the curls to have pretty hair for work that was SUPER easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually have hair like the product models now!!! Hair that all the other products promise you will have but never happens. Now let me say here my daughter who has thin hair strands but a LOT of it did not have the same results I did. She liked it OK but did not LOVE it. She prefers Biol-age and will use nothing else now. She has processed hair and uses a blow dryer and flat iron daily.I rarely blow dry and only occasionally flat iron especially now that I can have long silky locks :) I am almost finished with the first bottles, I hope it stays as good through the second one(s)!</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo on a regular basis and normally I purchase it at a salon. This time I decided I would order on Amazon to save money. Idk what junk is in this bottle but I can guarantee you it isn&#x27;t the real shampoo! I&#x27;m so disgusted and disappointed! I tried to return the shampoo but was told I was past my return date. (I didn&#x27;t open this bottle when I first received it because I had a salon bottle that I was still using). This is so disgusting!</li>
    <li> Love this product, works great on my hair!</li>
    <li> this product these hair so smooth and beautiful. You get a large quantity for a great price. I love the way that my hair looks and feels after using this product for only a week</li>
    <li> I love this product! It leave my hair feeling soft and manageable. This works on any type of hair or style.</li>
    <li> my boyfriend loves his healthy sexy hair!!</li>
    <li> Good shampoo, my hair is wavy, thick and slightly frizzy. This is a great everyday shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t smell very good though:(</li>
    <li> Such a great price for this shampoo. Much cheaper than in the salon or at the store. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, it really keeps my color from fading.</li>
    <li> I like the shampoo. It was what I expected. Good price for great item and doesn&#x27;t make my hair fall out.</li>
    <li> This my favorite shampoo</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo...it really makes my hair feel great but I just wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much. It really is too expensive to buy all the time.</li>
    <li> This shampoo looks and feels as if it has been watered down.  The shampoo&#x27;s color looks like a swirl and it does not lather.  I think it would be fine if I had purchased from a store.</li>
    <li> I am a red head which is the toughest co!or to keep true? this product is the best I have used to date.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo and had used it before I ordered on Amazon.  I, unfortunately, ordered it last winter and it arrived partially frozen.  I let it thaw and used it, but the freezing seemed to affect the consistency.  I would definately buy the shampoo again but would use caution in regard to when I ordered.  Don&#x27;t order for shipping when the temp is at freezing or below.... I should have returned it!</li>
    <li> I was complaining about my hair getting dry, harsh looking and with no volume at all. Tried different shampoos and didn&#x27;t blow-dry my hair for a while. My hairstylist at ULTA recommended this shampoo and the pairing conditioner. Turns out I was using shampoos with alcohol in them. I saw immediate results within the first 7 days of using it. My hair is back to its normal sleek silky texture and it looks very nice. I recommend to try it. I was using L&#x27;Oreal and Pantene products before. Never again!</li>
    <li> I used to buy Redken for color treated hair. I noticed my head would itch. I thought it was my hair color product. I switched to this pure, natural shampoo and my head was done with the itch! This is great shampoo and the conditioner is great too. I will never go back!</li>
    <li> This is nice shampoo although I prefer Aveda shampoos.  My co-worker uses Sexy Hair so I tried it.  I do like it and the smell is good too.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo paired with the conditioner.  This duo leaves my hair soft and doesn&#x27;t seem to strip hair color.  I don&#x27;t find the scent offensive; it&#x27;s a light, sort of citrus scent.</li>
    <li> This is a different consistency and smell than the original. Same package. Different contents.</li>
    <li> Smells lemony and makes my hair soooo soft and shiny!!!!! Seriously so happy about this. Huge bottle and soooo cheap.</li>
