<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have a neutral taste so more people can use them.Last for hours stimulating natural development of saliva and keeping mouth from drying out.</li>
    <li> These lozenges are an absolute disaster! I already use their toothpaste and it works FAIRLY well so I thought I&#x27;d take this next step. WRONG! If anything these cause even worse dry mouth!!! they taste awful, suck any moisture right out of your mouth, throat AND teeth. IT is to a point where you can barely talk after taking one. AND...they then make the best water taste VILE. They are also terribly expensive and their hype is filled with jive health jargon. This kind of marketing should be banned and this product should be discontinued.</li>
    <li> refreshing and a great way to get that fresh breath feeling</li>
    <li> These lozenges are decent for breath freshening, but I did not find them particularly helpful for dry mouth. They are just about as effective as any breath mint. They don&#x27;t last very long and once they&#x27;re gone, the benefits go with them.</li>
    <li> Best breath mint ever? Yes.</li>
    <li> These lozenges tasted good and helped to temporarily relieve my dry mouth symptoms.  However, one of the ingredients is Xylitol, and this can cause severe stomach gas - which it did to me. After taking a single lozenge, my stomach growled and gurgled within 15 minutes.  For ME, it&#x27;s not worth the aggrevation.</li>
    <li> For good for dry mouth.  With it individually wrapped, it is sanitary too.</li>
    <li> Dry mouth during long motorcycle rides is a killer, these help a lot.</li>
    <li> I try to have them with me regularly when out and about. They really work well in getting the juices flowing in the mouth. Keeps the breath clean and fresh also</li>
    <li> Its does the job, good product</li>
    <li> This whole &amp;#34;dry mouth&amp;#34; thing is , in my opinion, a scam/fad.&lt;br /&gt;It did nothing to help my situation. But, Hey, people have many worse conditions than dry mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Inside the box, were descriptions of what could cause dry mouth. Perhaps it&#x27;s my meds.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not that big a deal. I can live with it.</li>
    <li> Gave it to mother and she could not stand the taste</li>
    <li> Perfect. Originally bought them, b/c I wanted to reduce my sugar intake. I ended up needing them, b/c a medication I take causes horrible dry mouth. These are EXCELLENT. They really make my mouth water. I also take these on my 6 mile runs. They&#x27;re great for when my throat gets dry. I&#x27;ve probably bought at least 10 boxes.</li>
    <li> These did not wet my mouth as advertised.  Like, at all. :(  Super speedy shipping, though!  So that was a huge plus. :)</li>
    <li> This product remined me of Quench Gum. It had very intense flaovr also. Unfortunately, for Quench the flavor didn&#x27;t last. This flavor lasts but is not that great. Have you ever heard of onrange mint? Not the best combination. I was hoping for more Mandarin Orange and a lot less mint. I ordered two boxes and am sending one back. Maybe they will take both back even though I ate a couple of pieces out of the first box. I can say that while I have the stuff in my mouth it waters. The problem is I can&#x27;t stand the taste well enough to keep it in my mouth several times per day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK.  I love Hall&#x27;s Refresh much better than this but this is just like a Life Saver mint if you like those.</li>
    <li> Great product and it delivers what is promised.  Not trying to be funny but if you know anyone that is battling bad breath, offer them one of these and you will see what I mean.</li>
    <li> Great for after eating highly spicy or garlicky foods.  Freshens breath!</li>
    <li> Tastes great. Does help keep my mouth feeling more hydrated. I have dry mouth due to autoimmune disease.</li>
    <li> These have a great taste, do the job, are much easier to carry with you than a spray bottle, and at about half the cost of other similar products. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> When in doubt pull these mints out! Your friends will thank you!</li>
    <li> I detest the &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; of breath mints.  These TheraBreath Lozenges are something different, though, leaving a smooth, rather mild taste in my mouth, while they freshen the breath for kids (and spouses!) to enjoy.  The freshening effects seem to last a long time, too.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> In short, these mints do what they promise to do, however, I&#x27;m sure results will vary from person to person depending on one&#x27;s own oral hygiene and reactions to the ingredients in the mints.  I purchased these from Amazon last month and I can attest to their potency.  My biggest concern with this and Dr. Harold Katz products is the price tag.  There has to be a way for the price of his products to come down.  That alone may prevent me from purchasing this item again.</li>
    <li> These work very well and being sugar free is a plus.</li>
    <li> my husband has gum issues and dry mouth because of medications......this makes his difficulties much easier</li>
    <li> Really great mints. Small enough to keep in your pocket, car, or desk at the office. Mouth is noticeably more moist. Haven&#x27;t done a kiss test though!</li>
    <li> These taste horrible!!!  I don&#x27;t know if they work or not because I cant stand the taste.</li>
    <li> Use these everyday. No sugar and really help with dry mouth from Rheumatoid.</li>
    <li> Just amazing! Can&#x27;t say enough about these. I&#x27;ve always had issues with bad breath specially after lunch or mid-day. These are strong and do the job. Wish I knew of these sooner!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for another person.  She is pleased with the way the product leaves her mouth feeling so refreshed.</li>
    <li> I have severe dry mouth (Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome) that makes the whole inside of my mouth sensitive also.  These mints are too strong, so while they may be somewhat \\&quot;wetting\\&quot;, I can&#x27;t tolerate the sting they leave on my tongue or anywhere else in my mouth.</li>
    <li> Like the lozenges. Love that cool mint flavor it gives your mouth. It is really an eye opener.&lt;br /&gt;I share with my friends and they are amazed at the mint &amp;#34;Kick&amp;#34; they get.!! Great lozenge!</li>
    <li> My husband has dry mouth so I purchase this for him.  He loves the flavor and it really help the dryness</li>
    <li> The first ingredient listed on this product is sorbitol...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorbital is a sugar alchohol, and not particularly healthy. Many consumers of sorbital products have complained of intestinal issues after taking the sweetener.</li>
    <li> Read the reviews &amp; was very leery of trying these because of the negative reviews but THESE THINGS WORK!!! Purchased these at a store for about $10 (for 100). As far as the taste they taste just like a normal mint.  I&#x27;d compare it to a certs, so if you don&#x27;t like certs dont buy these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: these work exactly as described.  They get rid of bad breath and dry mouth &amp; taste fine while still on the mouth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: horrible metal aftertaste.  I&#x27;m thinking there must be zinc because there was a STRONG metal taste the second I took the mint out of my mouth(I was only testing &amp; didn&#x27;t dissolve the whole mint) the taste is absolutely terrible &amp; you WILL notice it. Not sure if the taste lingers longer if the whole mint is dissolved. Oddly enough, the second I took a sip of water the metal taste resolved. Not sure if it&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t eat the whole mint, But maybe water is the antidote for the taste?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line it works but that metal aftertaste is reeeeally bad. If you can deal, this is definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> Works! Lets me sleep AND worked as tasty sugar free - xylitol- breath mint.</li>
    <li> Unusual but not unpleasant taste.</li>
    <li> Delicious but ineffective. They may last ten minutes as far as dissolving goes, but for dry mouth treatment, they are not much better than a Lifesaver or a couple of Tic Tacs.</li>
    <li> My uncle got me onto these right before he died.  I would use them even if I didn&#x27;t need the mouth-wetting part, cuz they are tasty!  They totally work.  Which is great, because pretty much my whole family has halitosis, and we all take too many pills.  :P</li>
    <li> Like it, a pity they gouge you on prices as they have no real competition on the market.</li>
    <li> These really do help with dry mouth, and I think buyers will be happy once they have tried them.</li>
    <li> Horrible taste!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered for my constant dry mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money. Really weird, strong taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contacted manufacturer and they did refund money.</li>
    <li> Great product and tastes good.  Biotin makes me nauseated.</li>
    <li> If you get dry mouth, this is the stuff to use!</li>
    <li> excellent, have been using them for a couple years</li>
    <li> These are great to help with my chronic dry mouth.  They are small, individually wrapped, and so are very convenient. They are a great value for the money.</li>
    <li> After purchasing this for my daughter in law I purchased a second one for me. It does keep your mouth from drying and the minty taste keeps your breath fresh. I&#x27;ve put a few in different purses so I won&#x27;t be without them.</li>
    <li> Great product at a fantastic price with lightening fast shipping!!  Great seller!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> taste good just didn&#x27;t work as they claim</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the way they taste</li>
    <li> These really help dry mouth caused by medications. This is definitely the way to buy them in bulk.</li>
    <li> Their unique Lozenges are unlike any breath mint you have ever tried. They work in three distinct stages to make sure your mouth is fresh, moist, and healthy. This three stage approach is not only unique, but incredibly effective at controlling bad breath odor. These are just great! My husband, daughter and me we all used them. They are just the perfect size to carry in the car because each one is in a individual package. Also the box has 100 in them which lasts for quite some time. We used these after we ate out which was nice since some food can leave a not so good aftertaste and this took care it right away. These are just PERFECT!</li>
    <li> I suffer from dry mouth so I bought a 3 pack of these lozenges.  I keep one in the car, one at work and one at home.  They taste really good and definitely get the mouth watering.  I will definitely be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> These did exactly what was described. They taste great also.</li>
    <li> Greatest mint I have found for dry mouth, especially at night.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite breath mints! While they do keep your mouth wet (not drooling), they are great for after a meal (or before a kiss). Like Therabreath&#x27;s oral rinse, these mints really do freshen your breath and don&#x27;t merely (and temporarily) mask odors.</li>
    <li> A little too peppermenty for my taste. But relieves dry mouth</li>
    <li> Cooling and fresh. Last longer than other similar products.</li>
    <li> the best thing about the product is it actually wets your mouth. suffering from dry mouth is no longer a problem for me. no more sipping water or juice, this lozenge is it. plus mint fresh breath, not sweet at all!</li>
    <li> These work very well. Yahoo no more dry mouth</li>
    <li> I know this product is supposed to be used for helping with dry mouth.  I definitely get that.  However, I have been using these lozenges as mints.  I take these little bits of heaven with me everywhere.  I have them stashed in my purse, pockets, car, and bedroom.  The flavor grabs you as soon as that little square hits your tongue.  Do not chew it if you can help it.  Allow the mint to slowly dissolve and be sure to move it around your month to enhance the minty coverage.  Word of caution, you will not want to share these lozenges with people.  Overall, lozenges are great to use for freshening your breath and helping with dry mouth.  I definitely recommend these mints..I mean lozenges…to any and everyone.</li>
    <li> These are seriously strong mints.  I am a convert to the TheraBreath products.  I know they are more expensive than Colgate, but that&#x27;s not really working for you, is it?  Just get it over with - start with the toothpaste and the mouthwash.  Then you will know there is relief for bad breath out there.  Then, if you want that last minute minty mouth, get these.  They are great!</li>
    <li> works well - next time I would order gum</li>
    <li> They do what they say they&#x27;ll do, but wow the tingly feeling gets a little strange.  Almost like a battery to the tongue of u don&#x27;t keep moving it around your mouth.  Takes a while to dissolve.  But once I discovered I just had to keep it moving, I liked it a lot more.</li>
    <li> works for me. I frequently experience dry mouth when using my cpap machine and thie product seems to solve my problem.</li>
    <li> Not very citrusy-- and overpoweringly mint.... it does it&#x27;s job for breath and dry mouth.</li>
    <li> Always by my side....can&#x27;t live without em&#x27; they are at my desk and everywhere I go. Especially on the plane when my throat is dry.</li>
    <li> This lozenges help your breath while they are in your mouth, but after they dissolve your breath goes back to normal (can I say &amp;#34;stinky&amp;#34;?) and there is even a strange after-taste left too.</li>
    <li> For me it helps with dry mouth when it is in your mouth. After it dessolves, dry mouth returns.</li>
    <li> This product helps with dry mouth. Medicines can cause your mouth to feel dry. Dr Harold Katz lozenges work great with me. Give them a try. Amazon delivered right on time. Thanks Amazon[[ASIN:B004QM0OJ0 Dr. Harold Katz Therabreath Mouth Wetting Lozenges, 100-Count]]</li>
    <li> These sugar free breath lozenges are so much better than the breath mints you buy in the retail market! They do the job after brushing and rinsing...and you get 100 of them in a box! So convienient and worth the price!</li>
    <li> These are great for dry mouth and bad breath.  My son and I use all the time.  I order 6 -12 boxes at a time.</li>
    <li> Winner mint of the world award in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Great Product. You don&#x27;t have to have a dry mouth to enjoy.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness these were a favorite all around the house. My 16 year old (newly dating) son just about cleaned them out.  (I had to hide the rest). They are easy to carry in my pocket and I love the minty taste with just a hint of citrus.  I often suffer from dry mouth and I was pleasantly surprised how well these worked to keep my mouth moist and my breath fresh.</li>
    <li> Good taste and like the individual wrapping.</li>
    <li> These are so cool...my mouth keeps watering after I&#x27;ve dissolved the lozenge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a crazy amount, don&#x27;t worry ;) It&#x27;s just refreshing.</li>
    <li> Better price than the drug store. These are great for my son who is on ADHD medication that gives him dry mouth and bad breath. He appreciates this product. Fast shipping thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> It made me salivate, but it had  a strange, almost sour aftertaste.</li>
    <li> I have Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome &amp; other auto-immune diseases &amp; decided to give this a try as nothing else has worked for me. I could not even sleep at night because the dryness kept me awake &amp; constantly having to take drinks of water. Now I put the TheraBreath Lozenge in my mouth and fall asleep &amp; sleep most of the night. If I wake up I just put another one in my mouth and go back to sleep. I have had this problem for at least 15 years and never had anything work before. I would love to thank Dr.Katz in person.</li>
    <li> Best product ever. I play tennis every day and do a lot of work out. My mouth is always dry and the lozenges do their job perfectly.</li>
    <li> Use these lozenges at nite before I go to bed to relieve the overnite dryness that occurs in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;It has relieved that unpleasant and uncomfortable sensation and I am ordering this on an auto basis.</li>
    <li> These are strong!! They are a citrus minty flavor but really do the trick.</li>
    <li> Dry mouth is a thing of the past. Multiple medicines can cause dry mouth, and these lozenges are the answer. Worth the money as they do the job.</li>
    <li> Love these. I vape and take alot of meds that make my mouth dry. These are just like mints but moisten your mouth.</li>
    <li> When I popped the first (and only) lozenge in my mouth, I had to spit it out after about 3 seconds.  It has a highly unpleasant chemical taste, and you can&#x27;t easily rid you mouth of the aftertaste!  Horrible! Don&#x27;t waste your money! Also, please note the limited time for a return.  I went on vacation before attempting to return it, and now it is too late --- I really dislike that policy!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I only gave this one star because I was required to give at least one --- it doesn&#x27;t even deserve one star!</li>
    <li> Between age, medications, and my CPAP, I get REALLY dry mouth at night and moderate during the day. I tried Biotene gel and mouthwash, but the effects seemed very short term. The nice thing about the lozenges is that I can pop one in the middle of the night when the dryness wakes me up barely moving my CPAP mask and not having to get out of bed at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flavor is mild and tasty, but it has the same &#x27;rough dryness&#x27; sensation where it touches the skin inside your mouth that zinc tablets leave. The lozenge dissolves slowly, and there have been times I fell back asleep waiting for it dissolve. It also is not always very effective at actually wetting my mouth. Sometimes, there is a flood of saliva, sometimes just not very much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried to like these lozenges.  But...there is an odd taste and texture to them.  I spit them out before I can tell if they&#x27;ve done any good.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Happy with the product so far.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for years. They are a wonderful mint for oral care! After meals, dry mouth or just wanting to freshen up when away from home. I&#x27;m not sure why they are considered citrus, but really, they taste great and are not bad for your teeth! I always have a large box on hand so I can keep my purse stocked! Thera Breath products have not disappointed me thus far.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of these with a purchase of mouthwash. They are horrible. They burned my mouth. It wasn&#x27;t in the same way that Altos burn either. There wasn&#x27;t a ton of flavor, just a burning sensation!</li>
    <li> After using these for a while, Altoids have become too sweet and not strong enough! These things really last long, don&#x27;t leave that bad sugar flavor in your mouth later, and are strong as f.</li>
    <li> I have severe dry mouth disease.  I use the Biotene products as much as possible, but I developed TMJ issues after chewing just 1 Biotene dry mouth gum piece per day.  So I did some research online and I ordered 3 different dry mouth lozenges, and this was one of them.  This was the WORST.  On the front of the box, it says it was awarded the gold medal for \\&quot;superior taste\\&quot; in the category of \\&quot;best tasting mints\\&quot; by the \\&quot;American Masters of Taste\\&quot;.  Seriously?  Well, I have to admit, it DID make my salivary glands work again -- because I was so nauseated! And if you read the back of the box, you learn that Dr. Harold Katz developed these mints for his daughter because she had chronic bad breath, not dry mouth.  In case you&#x27;re wondering if I have wonky taste buds, let me assure you that I am a hobbyist gourmet chef and am regularly consulted by foodie friends to suggest wine pairings for their special dinners.  I have even been asked by vintners to suggest food pairings for their wines.  So I think I know something about \\&quot;superior taste\\&quot;, and these lozenges don&#x27;t qualify by any stretch of the imagination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of horrible dry mouth lozenges, don&#x27;t get the \\&quot;Scandinavian Formulas SalivaSure\\&quot; either.  They are grainy, bitter and leave your mouth dryer than when you put them in.  But they don&#x27;t make you want to barf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If, like me, you also suffer from extreme dry mouth and can&#x27;t chew Biotene gum, try the Salese Dry Mouth soft lozenges.  I realize they are a lot more expensive than the TheraBreath ones, but they actually work.  In fact, they are AWESOME.  If I just tuck one in my cheek while I&#x27;m gardening, it&#x27;s still there 2 hours later!  And I haven&#x27;t been having to swish water in my mouth every 10 minutes -- I&#x27;ve actually enjoyed my gardening in the warm morning sun.  The best price I&#x27;ve seen for them is on Amazon -- better even than the manufacturer&#x27;s price.  Yeayyy Amazon!</li>
    <li> Wow these really work. Didn&#x27;t have dry mouth but helped the breath a lot. Taste great and last for a while. I will buy these again!!!</li>
    <li> I like these, they help with dry mouth instantly, and they are a mild minty flavor, I like the citrus too. They help with dry mouth and it seems to last a couple hours too, really great, and the box will last me forever.</li>
    <li> These are great for dry mouth</li>
    <li> Strong mint that promotes saliva production. It can be a little too strong because it kind of stings my tongue a little. Almost tastes like candy so flavor is not an issue.</li>
    <li> Minty at first, then all baking soda taste. Ick.</li>
    <li> Did not seem to do appreciably more than any other mint.</li>
    <li> I ordered it hoping it would take care of my dry mouth from autoimmune disease&lt;br /&gt;and medication.  I didn&#x27;t like the taste and I didn&#x27;t notice any more than a brief&lt;br /&gt;respite from the dry mouth.</li>
    <li> They do work to get rid of dry mouth for a while.</li>
    <li> I keep them with me all the time.</li>
    <li> Got the Lozenges for my significant other and he uses them frequently.  I haven&#x27;t heard him complain about them so they must do the trick.  Believe me, if they didn&#x27;t do what they were suppose to do....he would be complaining.  Thank you Amazon and Dr. Katz.</li>
    <li> Stings, does not help with dry mouth</li>
    <li> Instead of helping, these Lozenges burned my tongue. They are way too strong and I did not like how they tasted.</li>
    <li> These are the best mints you can buy!</li>
    <li> I have to say that these do the opposite of helping with dry mouth. I think all the sugar alternatives they put into this doesn&#x27;t help people who have oral issues and are looking for something to use before bed or when waking up. It literally is just citrus flavor and then sugar and nothing else really beneficial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I&#x27;m left with afterwards is a mouth that needs to be brushed because of all the sweeteners added.</li>
    <li> I use them every night as logenzes to minimize dry mouth during sleep. It does not prevent dry mouth but at least I don&#x27;t wake up during the night. Using them this way, sometimes causes the inner cheek, where it stays during the night, to &amp;#34;sluff&amp;#34; off a small bit of skin with repeated use in same spot. This has caused no problem all. This morning both cheeks are normal.</li>
    <li> This product really works.</li>
    <li> Great, I have ordered them many times, no more fear of bad breath, really! Not liking the tooth paste however, need to improve on that. Mouth wash ok,</li>
    <li> They taste great and do the job they are meant to do. Have since checked out some of their other product which also work wonderful!! Good brand!</li>
    <li> I have dry mouth and was delighted to see this product in the store.  I am a senior citizen, but I am in good shape as far as my fingers are concerned.  Still, I cannot open the individual packages that the mints come in unless I have scissors.  That creates a problem if I am in a car, or at church, etc.  If you are strong, I guess they would be a good buy.  The taste is okay.</li>
    <li> Does what it says it does. What more can I ask?</li>
    <li> It is great to use at bed time, to keep my mouth moist.</li>
    <li> I need saliva generation help at night.  My previous product was prescription, did the job, but was discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;The Dry Mouth sugar free (necessary) lozenges work for me for most of the night.  Sure is a lifesaver.</li>
    <li> These little lozenges work as advertised.  They are quite strong and almost burn the tongue if you suck on  them in one place.  I let them slowly melt between the cheek and gum.  Seems to stave off dry mouth for a good hour.</li>
    <li> not as good as xylimints; they don&#x27;t last very long</li>
    <li> I like &#x27;em a lot.... one Right before bed- I am less bothered by dry-mouth and I sleep better.</li>
    <li> Medications leave my mouth chronically and uncomfortably dry.  These are the best mints/lozenges I&#x27;ve found for this -- they really help.  Handy to put in your pocket, as they&#x27;re individually wrapped.  Sugar free -- contain xylitol.  Give them a try.</li>
    <li> These are great for &amp;#34;dry mouth&amp;#34; they melt slowly and don&#x27;t break apart. My mouth feels much better. Some medication&#x27;s cause &amp;#34;dry mouth&amp;#34;, so along with the rinses and sprays I keep these nearby. They have a nice flavor too.</li>
    <li> moisturizers for my mouth after throat cancer - works the best over other products - hard to find any where</li>
    <li> These Therabreth lozengers work great I&#x27;m not crazy about the flavor thought I would purchase them again maybe in lemon flavor.</li>
    <li> They are disgusting.  I can&#x27;t tell you if they work because I had to spit it out.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd box for me. I wish that the mints lasted longer, instead, after awhile, you have to crunch down on it.  :Overall, the really help my dry mouth- more than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This is the best daytime lozenges for those with chronic dry mouth. I&#x27;m so glad to find these and so glad that Amazon offers them at a great price.</li>
    <li> the lozenges greatlly alleviate the dry mouth feel and also tastes very good  i keep re ordering this great product</li>
    <li> They work great, are individually wrapped for convenience, and taste great too.  I have bought this several times and will buy them again.</li>
    <li> I got roped into these with a free trial package sent by the manufacturer when I first purchased the TheraBreath toothpaste system, and I&#x27;ve been ordering and re-ordering them ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have a very fresh, light minty orange taste that has dimension and doesn&#x27;t get old or overly familiar. I love that they&#x27;re individually wrapped because it avoids pocket bulge if you just want to carry around a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re also not just specialty mints for folks with perpetually kicking breath. Everyone needs a mint from time to time after meals, and these are perfect for that. The thing that makes them unique is that they&#x27;re natural and they actually last long enough (unlike some natural chewing gums) to make an impact to clean the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, this doesn&#x27;t taste like a dental product. It tastes like a really good mint. I&#x27;d highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Love this lozenges and freshens breath also.</li>
    <li> These are great for dry mouth anytime, minty but not too strong. They are individually wrapped, so great on the go to grab for purse or pocket. Like the mail-order setup so don&#x27;t have to think about running out.</li>
    <li> You will need to brush or use a rinse regularly, can&#x27;t rely on this product alone to get you fresh breath. but when you use it, it works for that time being</li>
    <li> very strong taste, and not something I want to use when I go to bed, and that is kinda what I am looking for, will use in the daytime, but the mint is very strong</li>
    <li> Work really well, but not any better than other freshener.</li>
    <li> It make your mouth feel not only minty but lasts a while.  I feel very confident when I am talking to someone after using one of these mints.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I thought this will help with my dry mouth. I don&#x27;t it helped in any way. I am not sure whether or not I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stand the taste of these lozenges. They are very chemically tasting and I can&#x27;t get through half of one lozenge before I have to spit them out. I ended up giving them to a friend who found them to be acceptable tasting.</li>
    <li> I bought a chin strap to keep my mouth closed at night thinking that would end waking up with a bone dry mouth. While it did work as promised, I discovered that my problem was not so much my chin as my lips. These dry mouth lozenges work. I open two packages each night. I take one as I go to bed and the other when I wake up in the middle of the night. I hold them between my cheek and my jaw. These have pretty much solved the problem and they are sugar free which is a huge plus. I bought 4 boxes and will be buying more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Medication I take dries my mouth out so I got these to take along when I am out of the house without direct access to water.  They worked for a short time and tasted ok, but I had far better results with the Biotene tablets.  I probably won&#x27;t order these again. medication</li>
    <li> fast shipper .///....good deal...thanks...</li>
    <li> Husband gets these constantly, as he is always working around many people. They do the job , and have recommended to family members as well. Last a good few hours, no need to worry about bad breath. Nice to have on hand in my purse, if cannot brush teeth right away.</li>
    <li> I buy these all the time for my son.  He loves the taste and how they keep his mouth moist while in school.  I&#x27;m sure having fresh breath also has something to do with it!  :-)</li>
    <li> I have a dry mouth condition. These lozenges help keep my mouth moist, my breath fresh and taste great every time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my fave and helps since I have braces:)</li>
    <li> I got this for my dry mouth caused by Sjogren&#x27;s, as well as my spouse who has dryness from meds he takes, and my teen son who worries about his breath. None of us were able to tolerate it. It is rough on a dry mouth and I had to spit it out because it hurt. My tongue was burning. My husband---and son (who doesn&#x27;t have dryness)-- also spit out their lozenges.</li>
    <li> it was a gift for someone.</li>
    <li> my favorite lozenges on the market for dry mouth the only one that is effective enough to say they really work, this one does and taste great and last for a very time as a breath freshener too!</li>
    <li> Great product to go along with the TheraBreath mouth wash and toothpaste. Eliminate Bad breath right away and long lasting. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> These are great for adding moisture to your mouth and will not harm your teeth.</li>
    <li> This is a purchase you won&#x27;t regret. Take caution when sharing with friends because they will quickly grow to love them too. The mouth wetting helps a lot if you are scheduled for a briefing or discussion, and it&#x27;s been helpful to use before running to prevent serious dry mouth.</li>
    <li> I loved this product&lt;br /&gt;I keep it in my office for refreshing especially for meetings after my strong coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also keep it on my bed drawer to have one in the morning as I spend 5 minutes reviewing my to do list and enjoy the refreshing candy before even brushing my teeth.</li>
    <li> Works Great!  My husbands talks all day and his mouth get&#x27;s dry so you can imagine the smelly breath but with these lozenges it&#x27;s much better.  We use it along with the mouthwash.</li>
    <li> worked fine if not lasting as long as said. Course might be because I drank water a few minutes later. Would buy again</li>
    <li> This is the best odor neutralizing mint i have ever tried.  The taste is mild.  It is not as minty as an altoid, but is much mroe effective and longer lasting.</li>
    <li> very tasty orange-mint flavor.  will definitely get you salivating, unless you have an auto-immune disease that is attacking your salivary glands.  i can even tuck one in my cheek or buccal pouch and go to sleep!  this is important because i have to take a dosage of the xerostomia-causing med just before i go nighty-nite.</li>
    <li> I have tried them all but this one is the answer......don&#x27;t try anything else.  This one works.  Also great for good smelling breath.</li>
    <li> these r STRONG.  FUERTE.  it killed my smoker&#x27;s breath in less than 1 min.&lt;br /&gt;these mints r the absolute truth</li>
    <li> Best breath mint - it quickly eliminates the bad-breath bacteria</li>
    <li> They are not lozenges in the sense that they do not soothe your mouth and throat. The taste is like baking soda and salt mixed with soda water. Like Oxyclean for your mouth. My husband says it tastes like Certs with no sweetener. Not a bad thing, but I thought they might use xylitol for it&#x27;s cavity fighting properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The TheraBreath lozenges didn&#x27;t meet my needs of soothing or helping my dry mouth and they caused a lot of big canker sores. So I&#x27;d say they were the opposite of a lozenge. I reviewed the mouthwash too; TheraBreath products all seem to cause me serious canker sores. But I have a sensitive mouth (I have Lupus) and many dental products have this effect on me (which is why I bought these products). SLS isn&#x27;t the only irritant in dental products folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These arrived in a big box of little packets, like for a dentist office to give away or something. Too much packaging waste for personal use. If this review is helpful or informative in anyway, please vote yes below so it is more visible to other shoppers looking for dental products for sensitivities.</li>
    <li> Better than mints as these lozenges keep your mouth from drying out.</li>
    <li> These have been wonderful.  Being diabetic and taking so man pills my mouth gets very very dry.  Instantly relieves this problem</li>
    <li> Mouth-wetting, cheap enough, ok flavor, but  doesn&#x27;t last long, especially overnight during my sleep, which is when I most need it.</li>
    <li> These taste SO bad, i have tried several times to keep one in my mouth but end up spitting them out. ew</li>
    <li> These are great and better than any other lozenges or mints I&#x27;ve tried recently.  They do wonders for bad breath and always give my mouth a clean feeling.  I also like the fact that they are not full of sugar or sugar substitutes.  Unlike other mints, these also don&#x27;t seem to have an aftertaste that lasts a long time and causes other food and drink to taste strange.  I usually buy a box every 2-3 months, which doesn&#x27;t seem too bad price wise either.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing gets rid of bad breath immediately and keeps teeth very clean.</li>
    <li> Got these as gifts! Great product and effective!</li>
    <li> Good product. It helps.</li>
    <li> mints are old and not as hard as the ones i bought in the store</li>
    <li> I started taking this because my medication was giving me a dry mouth.  These mints are strong and long-lasting.  They wet my mouth while giving me fresh breath.</li>
    <li> I got three boxes of these with the thought that they would last a month.  Two were gone in about two weeks.  Saving the third for travel.  Instead, I recommend just using mouthwash more frequently where possible.  While there was some improvement in affecting breath odor, the combination of Katz&#x27;s mouthwash (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ET76AI/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_135) and toothpaste (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ET7G9E/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_128) are really the only things I&#x27;ve found to address my (according to my family, really terrible) bad breath.</li>
    <li> I should have followed the other reviews. I like strong mints like Altoids, but these are WAY too strong if you have mouth sores from a dry mouth issue. I couldn&#x27;t taste any citrus. Just a medicine tasting mint.  Way to strong for me! I had to return them:( I recommend sugar free jolly ranchers</li>
    <li> These are NASTY and make me want to be sick!!!  Eeeew!!!!  It&#x27;s not like a mint.  It&#x27;s like a medicine that the taste of should not last as long as this disgusting &#x27;lozenge&#x27; does!</li>
    <li> Absolute magic.  Several medications connive to give me a problem with drymouth, which far too often leads to thrush (which kills sense of taste and causes sore tongue and throat - not fun.)  Thera-breath came up in a search for anti-thrush treatments.  It works wonderfully.  It also ensures inoffensive breath.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> These taste great and are perfect for the desk drawer or purse.</li>
    <li> Yuck. And a lifesaver does a better job.</li>
    <li> I returned this item because I did not like it.</li>
    <li> My fiance had nasopharyngeal cancer and the radiation treatments dried up his salivary glands.  He sucks on these all day long, and they do work well.</li>
    <li> I bought a box of these for my dry mouth symptoms. Last night I woke up and used one, and it was like a sponge soaking up every little bit of moisture that was in my mouth, and I continued to have cotton mouth all day today. No, I don&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
    <li> These mints do the trick. They help saliva production as well as keep the breathe smelling great. At first they came off really strong but I have gotten use to the minty kick. I really like how they are not full of sugar and not has harmful to my teeth. Each mint comes individually wrapped which is great for just throwing in your pockets, bag, or purse. They can be taken anywhere. I have already used and purchased three boxes.</li>
    <li> This is the best! I love it and I am a happy customer!</li>
    <li> I know a lot of people like tastes that I don&#x27;t like, but these lozenges turned my mouth wrong-side out!  I hate to say that, but in all truth, I can&#x27;t help it.  I have had cancer, and was treated with radiation on my neck, throat, and head.  Many things burn my mouth and throat.  Perhaps that&#x27;s why it tastes like that to me.  I gave mine away and haven&#x27;t heard yet from my &#x27;giftee.&#x27;  If I don&#x27;t hear from her, perhaps she is avoiding me...think so?</li>
    <li> My husband has dry mouth caused by medication.  He use these when needed.</li>
    <li> Don&amp;#34;t waste your money purchase a similiar product @ a drug store. I purchased these they were similar to tic tacs,</li>
    <li> Made holes in my tongue and really hurt. Don&#x27;t eat too many of them in a row. In fact, maybe keep it down to one or two a day.</li>
    <li> My wife spent a year having chemo and radiation therapy for lymphoma. She is, thank the Lord, now cancer-free. But she still has an exceptionally dry mouth because of her treatments. This is the lozenge that relieves that more than any other lozenge.</li>
    <li> its for my mom, and no complaints</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently just started taking Citalopram . Dry mouth is one of the side effects. I&#x27;ve tried everything from mouth rinses &amp; toothpastes to gum. Thos products work but it doesn&#x27;t last. These mints work great ! The taste is a little overwhelming for me, but it works wonders! After one mint my mouth stays moist for 3-4 hours !! It awesome &amp; you get so many for the price.</li>
    <li> Bought the set, this stuff really works!</li>
    <li> This product solved my dry mouth problem by using one at bed time. Every dentist and suppliers of C-Paps should recommend this product. I had to show my dentists and I have given these to several friends who suffer dry mouth like I used to suffer with every morning.</li>
    <li> It stings like when you put Listerine in your mouth!  Only far worse. What does that tell you! NO thanks.</li>
    <li> I brought these candies for my patient .who had radiation therapy on her neck. Patient said, she used up to 5 candies a day and she felt much better for her dry mouth.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I wanted more of these products and went to the company web site....boy did I have fun shopping!  I bought a couple of more products related to this one here on Amazon and can really tell you that they soothe the throat and mouth very well.  You&#x27;ll like them.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Leaves mouth clean feeling.</li>
    <li> Have only tried it out for two weeks. I do not taste much of the orange only the mint.</li>
    <li> these really don&#x27;t provide the moisture they should for this type of product. XyliMelts are worth the extra $$. The flavor is ok, not great.</li>
    <li> Remarkable if you have dry mouth from medication. The minty breath is a bonus. Will definitely purchase these again.</li>
    <li> Some of my medications cause my mouth to be really dry, and I have been trying different products such as sprays and lozenges. This one is just too strong for me. It is smaller than a cough drop, but larger than an Altoid with a similar chalky texture. It is about as &amp;#34;curiously strong&amp;#34; as a peppermint Altoid, which I find just too intense for dry mouth. I think this might appeal more to people looking for breath freshening products. It does add some moisture, however the flavor is so strong I can hardly enjoy the feeling because it stings a little. I find the ACT lozenges much more soothing, with milder mint flavor and more of a hard candy texture than powder which feels a little smoother in my mouth. The mint/orange is an interesting flavor, if only it were more subtle.</li>
    <li> Whenever you put that sugary gum/mint in your mouth - think of what it is really doing - its just masking the bacteria. With the saliva that these mints help your mouth create, those bacteria cells deteriorate quickly and leave your mouth so much fresher for a better healthier period of time. The handy slide out compartment is really neat, and they are easy to bring a couple with you wherever you go. Plus add the sub &amp; save deal and it&#x27;s a no brainer.</li>
    <li> very strong, but they work. almost so strong I cant use them</li>
    <li> Very good. Would recommend</li>
    <li> Finally something that helps with dry mouth!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product</li>
    <li> Helps eliminate bad breath.</li>
    <li> I use these during the day, headed to meetings or when I will have close 1-1 contact. I use the brand paste and mouth rinse which I love and they do the trick. I use these to be extra confident. I have sinus issues that cause chronic bad breath. I no longer worry about the bad breath! A must have staple in my opinion. They are spendy, but worth every cent.</li>
    <li> w&lt;br /&gt;orks the way it should</li>
    <li> I have dry mouth, so I am always looking for a product to replace Biotene Gel. This product&#x27;s main ingredient is sugar. It really did not work for me.</li>
    <li> This are great.  Make your mouth moist and your breath nice.  I love them.  Always keep one by the bedside.</li>
    <li> Right on time. Right product. Great product.</li>
    <li> If you have dry mouth, these lozenges will solve your problem during the night. But don&#x27;t take anyone&#x27;s opinion, including mine, just invest in one box and find out the truth for yourself.</li>
    <li> I must say I wasn&#x27;t sure what I&#x27;d be tasting. But the pleasant minty and citrus taste is refreshing. It lasts for quite a while too so your breath stays fresh. But, the big test was whether or not it would keep my mouth from being dry. Medication causes me to  often experience dry mouth and no matter how many bottles of water I drink I get little relief at times. TheraBreath \\&quot;wetting\\&quot; lozenges did the trick. They worked exactly as promised. I give a big thumbs up to this product with one small exception. They use sorbitol as a sweeter. I would much rather they used a sweetener such as \\&quot;splenda\\&quot; instead. Sorbitol often times has ill effects on the stomach. Overall the product stands up to its name, it is both breath freshening and mouth wetting.Copyright© KatherinesCorner.com-for Amazon.com</li>
    <li> These lozenges was okay, they was a little too strong for me.  You really get your money worth. If I worked in a office where I&#x27;m talking and sitting close to people I would keep on desk.</li>
    <li> They seem to do the job just fine. The taste isn&#x27;t like a mint but it&#x27;s better than the alternative dry mouth.</li>
    <li> The medications I&#x27;m on make my mouth so dry and sticky that I often can&#x27;t swallow. Drinking water doesn&#x27;t really help since the problem is that I am not producing saliva. I pop one of these in and I produce saliva immediately. My mouth feels &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; and clean right away. I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it does. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of other lozenges, throat drops, hard candy, etc and NOTHING works like these. I used them in the hospital and now at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to remember to let them dissolve in my mouth and not chomp them up, but otherwise, they are perfect. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Works just as indicated. Helps me especially at church where I no longer have to carry a bottle of water all the time. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Keep an eye in this product. Excellent for dry mouth. I reordered it and the new ones have 72 mints instead if previous 100 mints.</li>
    <li> Best breath mints ever</li>
    <li> Great for dry mouth. Individually wrapped so easy to carry in pocket. Also quick and easy to open.</li>
    <li> Better than the tooth paste and mouth wash for sure. But I won&#x27;t be ordering theses products again. It&#x27;s OK.</li>
    <li> These do everything they advertise to do. Leaves you mouth with a nice, clean taste and feeling. They are a bit strong but not os much as to be unpleasant. I keep some in my shirt pocket every day.</li>
    <li> I just returned these.  I have high blood sugar and sensitivies to chemicals, so my mouth is very dry.  I cannot use the&lt;br /&gt;stuff Bio stuff at the store, as it has Glycerine in it.  Don&#x27;t they know that Glycerine can give you dry mouth?  I got these,&lt;br /&gt;thinking they sounded really good.  These made my mouth more dry if that is possible!  I let my grown daughter try one,&lt;br /&gt;and she doesn&#x27;t have a dry mouth at all.  She complained it made her mouth more dry.  This is crazy.  Either something&lt;br /&gt;was wrong with mine or they need to go back to the drawing board on these.</li>
    <li> A returning satisfied customer.  Just a very fine product.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Great taste that lasts for several hours.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really sure it will take a bad breath away, but it certainly will lubricate a dry mouth.  It tastes great to me but my son thought it wasn&#x27;t.  He spit it out.  I happen to love the taste but I am an older (wise) woman.  I use the Therabreath mouthwash and toothpaste and this mint is nice to take along.  The mint lasts a long time in the mouth, refreshing my taste buds.  If you like Dr. Katz products, you should give this delicious mint a try. I gave it 4 stars because of the high price-- for mints!</li>
    <li> I took the box into work and put it beside the employee sink etc they were gone within two days. Even the younger people enjoyed them. For those who suffer dry mouth it increases the moisture somewhat, for those who do not the effect varies some people said they had a lot of saliva others said nothing about excess saliva flow. Nice fresh mint flavor but did not taste of mandarin whatsoever</li>
    <li> I get dry mouth and while I don&#x27;t find that this product helps wet my mouth, it does taste good and strong and at least makes me feel more confident with my breath. Certainly more than any other breath mint. I would buy this again when I run out. for 100 lozenges, the price was right.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light, and effective. Leaves one confident in close conversations. Combined with the fresh start of Therbreath mouth wash, one can feel confident all day</li>
    <li> great for on the go keep in my car</li>
    <li> These are wonderful and the box is so practical</li>
    <li> yes i know they&#x27;re expensive. but these mints do wonder for anyone and everyone. these freshen your breath like no other mint in the world. It wets your mouth which will improve your breath, as dry mouth is a very common cause of bad breath. The taste is also great. They are certified kosher by KSA and they also come with a bunch of coupons for therabreath.</li>
    <li> I use multiple products from Dr. Katz.  The products from Dr. Katz meet my needs more effectively than other options which I have tried.  That has contributed to my loyalty.....since I&#x27;ve been using his products for about/almost 20 years.</li>
    <li> Price was great. Taste great. Work great. Glad I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> These tasted awful. I ended up spitting them out. They tasted like vapor rub. I don&#x27;t recommend them at all.</li>
    <li> Works same way as its other product</li>
    <li> These are super strong. Didn&#x27;t make my dry mouth better but did leave lasting fresh breath.</li>
    <li> The intensity of these mints was much too strong for the dryness of my mouth to tolerate. Under normal circumstances, such as for a breath mint, they probably would have been acceptable, however they are marketed for dry mouth. In addition to the flavor&#x27;s being much too intense, the astringency was readily evident, and my mouth felt much more stuck to itself with using them than it had felt moments before. I gave them to a friend who likes them. Sugar-free candies do much more for my mouth than these did.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think that there is a better product than this! It protects against infections and stops one if there is already started. There is not much else to say; it works!</li>
    <li> Work very well.  My wife says it feels like it leaves a film on her tongue.</li>
    <li> My breath was absolutely horrible. Now it is as fresh as the south end of a north bound mule.&lt;br /&gt;If I could just get rid of the flies following me around I&#x27;d give this 5 stars!!!!</li>
    <li> I have severe dry mouth.  Therabreath lozenges do stimulate saliva.  But, for your mouth to remain hydrated you have to take them continually.  They do a nice job of freshening your breath.</li>
    <li> I had long problem of bad breadth. It made more trouble while travelling. As airport screening makes trouble on carrying liquid, it is good solution.</li>
    <li> These are not bad for a dry mouth.  I just think the taste is a little strong for me.  I gave some to my mom who also suffers from dry mouth due to medication.  I just wish they came in a different flavor..bit they are better than dealing with the dry mouth....</li>
    <li> I bought it because of the dry mouth I suffer with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does work good on combating dry mouth.  Melts slowly.  Feels nice in the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I did not care for was the flavor.  It seemed intense.  Perhaps after I get use to the flavor it will be better.  But the flavor just seemed stronger than my sore, dry mouth could handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry mouth it would be worth trying.  Just be ready for some intense flavor.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a breath freshener without aspartame and I found it to be almost impossible. Since I had recently purchased another therabreath product amazon suggested this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, something without aspartame/sucralose/splenda.&lt;br /&gt;The 100ct comes in a box like you&#x27;d find at a supermarket or gas station selling candy. There is a flap half way down the box that pulls open and the individually wrapped mints pool into the open flap. Well a few of them do at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried one the mint was overpowering. I almost couldn&#x27;t take it. As I tried it a second and third time I became accustomed to the strong flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can understand if people can&#x27;t get over the extremely concentrated flavor. This Mint is not for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy it, try it a couple of times before you deem it unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my mouth is dry, it can be a bit harsh on my tongue. But after a minute it my mouth is no longer dry and my tongue is more tolerant to the strong flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s more functional than recreational.&lt;br /&gt;As for my breath I definitely feel more confident when talking to people after a dose of the strong mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to look up the ingredients because I became curious when I didn&#x27;t see any noticeable sweeteners in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am always trying to stay away from artificial sweeteners. When I came to xylitol, i found that it is a sweetener derived from a type of alcohol. I am not sure if its any better or worse than aspartame/splenda/sucralose.</li>
    <li> Strong and works well for me.</li>
    <li> Worked well and tasted really good</li>
    <li> super price for the product</li>
    <li> Taste great and are true to their label of \\&quot;mouth wetting\\&quot;.  That sounds funny but my tongue doesn&#x27;t feel like a cat&#x27;s tongue now.    They&#x27;re great for a middle of the night helper.  I must breathe through my mouth while sleeping and my mouth feels awful.  These Lozenges are extremely helpful AND I love the flavor.  I appreciate that they are sugar free.  They aren&#x27;t going to cause cavities while they moisturize my mouth.  I&#x27;ve tried other products (ACT Dry Mouth Lozenges) but I like the flavor of these more and they work better.  They&#x27;re individually wrapped so I can take a few with me - wherever I go.</li>
    <li> I always have these on hand.  They&#x27;re super!  They taste great, and they moisturize your mouth.  I use Therabreath toothpaste and rinse, and these are so good to use throughout the day.  I highly recommend them.  (They are individually wrapped, which is nice when you throw a handful into your purse!)</li>
    <li> Great product, great taste, works exactly as advertised.  I used in conjunction with mouth wash and paste.  Will continue to order</li>
    <li> This product does NOT perform as described.</li>
    <li> These do work but I was a little put off by the taste and afte-taste. Can definitely improve the taste.</li>
    <li> My first taste- WOW, these are strong! Now I really like them. They melt slowly, so last longer. It really stimulates saliva flow. BTW, if you have a cold, these will open your nose.</li>
    <li> Weird at first but I think they work ok.  Don&#x27;t know if they keep my mouth wet any longer than the mint is in my mouth though.  Regular mints do that.</li>
    <li> Delicious.  I use it for my extreme dry mouth.  It is great to find something I can have in my mouth all the time without damaging my teeth with sugar.</li>
    <li> Great product. Good for dry mouth.</li>
    <li> Not Bad and a little strange tasting but it grows on you.</li>
    <li> Hello, Everyone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a type of guy who reads almost every single review negative and positive and come up with a conclusion for myself. I also very heavily rely on the star rating. Anything 3 stars and below I&#x27;m very careful to order; anything 4/5 stars I still do my work but rely more on peoples reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery: Arrived quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Condition: Excellent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product itself: It works, makes your mouth water, and kills bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it: Yes i would&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any questions feel free to ask.</li>
    <li> These are  great!  My breath stays fresh for a long time with just one mint.  I talk to people all day long.  I do not have to constantly take a drink of water or check my breath to feel confident.</li>
    <li> These are no better &amp;#34;breath&amp;#34; mints than any other. They do, however, help with dry mouth, have a pleasant taste and work for me when I can&#x27;t get to a bottle of water. They also remind me of a mint that I loved in the 80&#x27;s -- Velamints. Nice flavor. Too expensive in Walgreen&#x27;s, so buy them on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Makes my breath fresh, cuts through any bad taste or smell. Must-have for dental hygiene.</li>
    <li> Great.  When I take them to work for my candy bowl, they don&#x27;t last a week!</li>
    <li> I do recommend them!!</li>
    <li> Keep in mind that these are very strong ( intense ). I have found that these are my best friend after my radiation treatments. Love them.</li>
    <li> Xylitol is excellent for your teeth and these are individually wrapped...  What is not to love?  These are minttastic!  These are ideal to hand to anyone with stink-mouth (no fear of someone touching your open tin of mints/gum).</li>
    <li> They are good. But they are just mints. I expected a more pronounced effect, to be honest. So next time instead of buying these, I might just buy sugar free mints from the grocery store.</li>
    <li> I was hoping these lozenges would help to relieve dry mouth, but they did no better than the sugar free vitamin c drops I am using and the vitamin c drops taste much better.</li>
    <li> These taste terrible.  But they work.  I take them with me and use when needed.  My meds cause my mouth to dry out.</li>
    <li> Everyone at work loves these mints, especially the coffee drinkers. Mints taste great I always have them in my pocket.</li>
    <li> Love the concept of thera breath products!! They keep their promise!! WORTH BUYING AND TRYING THEM OUT!! Wont disappoint you!</li>
    <li> My son and I love this lozenges because it help soothe throat itchiness.  Very mild!</li>
    <li> I bought these in desperation.  The price wasn&#x27;t bad compared to what I paid for the Salese lozenges at Amazon, but I hate them.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t last long at all.  Maybe 10 minutes and then they are gone.  My mouth is dry again in 5-10 more minutes.&lt;br /&gt;The taste isn&#x27;t good, but the tingle it leaves behind is not only uncomfortable it messes with my sense of taste.  I&#x27;ll go so far as to liken it it solving my dry mouth problem by using a mini taser on my tongue.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer regular, cheap Myntz Vanllamints to these.  They taste better and moisten my mouth equally, which isn&#x27;t saying much.&lt;br /&gt;I am going back to order more Salese.  One lozenge lasts me 6 hours if I am awake or all night while sleeping.  The taste wasn&#x27;t my favorite, but it wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable or nasty.</li>
    <li> These destroy bad breath, even morning breath. They come individually wrapped so you can grab a few and are much more effective than an Altoids and quieter in your pocket than Tic Tacs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Effective, individually wrapped, helps with dry mouth&lt;br /&gt;Cons: They make your mouth wet enough you might drool if you aren&#x27;t careful, individually wrapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also contain Xylitol to kill germs, which can cause gas, but I found these don&#x27;t have the extreme effect that Xylitol gum has.</li>
    <li> These are pretty good, but not the best I&#x27;ve used.  I prefer the xlimelts.</li>
    <li> Works well to moisten a dry mouth and freshen breath. I use when I have dry mouth from nervousness or prescription drug use and can talk well.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. I would highly recommend it for others to use!!</li>
    <li> The most awful thing you may stick in your mouth ! Save your money.</li>
    <li> I agree with others who said the flavor is too strong. But they&#x27;re tolerable and do help. I just have occasional dry mouth where water doesn&#x27;t seem to quench the thirst and that&#x27;s when I use them.</li>
    <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1) These are good mints.  They conquer bad breath. Better than most gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1) They are a little harder to carry around than a pack of Therabreath gum, since they are in individual packages, but not a huge deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) They have a touch of \\&quot;alternative sugar\\&quot; taste, not sure if it&#x27;s from Xylitol and/or from Stevia. However, it&#x27;s nowhere as near as bad as most other gums though (Trident, etc.., which can have sucralose / aspartame, etc... which I don&#x27;t like).  Therabreath gum doesn&#x27;t have this taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like Therabreath gum better (see link below), I hope Amazon.com starts selling the gum.  In the meantime, this product will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001KYQH7A TheraBreath Fresh Breath GUM, Pack of 3]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004ZN7G0K TheraBreath Chewing Gum Box]]</li>
    <li> First of all, I love Therabreath products. As someone with chronic bad breath, their mouthwash and toothpaste have saved my life! I did start out liking this product (would have given it a 5 star) because it does what it advertizes to do extremely well, clears up dry and bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My issue with these lozenges is that they contain sorbitol and xylitol and if you don&#x27;t know they can and have caused me extreme stomach issues, stomach pain, gas, and diarrhea! It took me a while to put the two and two together but when i did,I stopped taking them and my stomach went back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say this though, not everyone is as sensitive to sorbitol and xylitol as me (I was taking ~2/day) so if they don&#x27;t bother you, these are probably best lozenges on the market for dry mouth and bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last thing I&#x27;ll say is I&#x27;m surprised they don&#x27;t have a disclaimer on the package warning the known side effects of  sorbitol and xylitol. Even gum containing sorbitol and xylitol would say if consuming too much may lead to diarrhea.</li>
    <li> Husband suffering from throat cancer and needed something to keep mouth moist.  This product was not at all helpful.</li>
    <li> These lozenges are so dry themselves its like sucking on a piece of chalk and it leaves your mouth dryer than before you had one of these lozenges. And they have an awful after taste that lasts forever. I also purchased the toothpaste, which I haven&#x27;t tried and am not going to try. I will be contacting TheraBreath to find out how I can return this awful product.</li>
    <li> I carry these in my purse so I can pop one whenever I&#x27;m face to face with another human and can&#x27;t be sure that my breath is fresh. These really do the trick. It&#x27;s an odd minty flavor, not sweet at all but not unpleasant, and it does the trick. The fresh feeling lasts for a lot longer than with gum or other breath mints. I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I would buy this again, but I wouldn&#x27;t rule it out. I had 2-3 boxes. I got them when I was having severe oral health issues, which are still sort of mysterious. I haven&#x27;t figured out for sure what happened to my mouth, but I believe it was a combination of things, primarily my diet, which caused my health issues. When I cut out gluten and lactose, things at first got like 80-90% better, which still left my mouth in not great shape because it was SO SO SO SO bad. I mean, I had breath from hell (my boyfriend said that it smelled like something rotting), flies followed me around everywhere, and my mouth felt like it was being devoured by bacteria no matter how much I cleaned it out. It gradually got better after the initial improvement, and now the problem is like at least 95% gone, although it got worse again recently after I ate a little gluten. I had a surgery on one of my salivary glands a few years ago, so I wonder if that decreased my saliva flow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I digress. Okay, I tried these lozenges along with some other products when it was really, really bad. I don&#x27;t think they helped with dry mouth AT ALL - I&#x27;m pretty certain they made my mouth even drier. However, I was probably overdoing it because I was trying like crazy to clean out my mouth. I was definitely at times overdoing my mouthwash, which seriously dried out my mouth. Like the lozenges, the mouthwash is zinc based. Use it too much and it made my teeth ache - I am not sure if that&#x27;s from dry mouth or the zinc/ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended for dry mouth, however, they are not bad at least for occasional use. Zinc based products were the only things I could find that really made any difference when my oral health was the worst. They made my mouth cleaner and improved the breath. They taste good, mild mint (I don&#x27;t like strong mint). Only last 5 minutes each. Probably even one will dry out your mouth, especially if you are already using another zinc based product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thatbeing said, I have now tried a couple other dry mouth products, and literally all of them seem to dry out my mouth. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m overusing them all or what. I just tried Act dry mouth mouthwash, and it seems to have made my mouth feel drier while simultaneously increasing my flow of saliva (a lot). Now I feel like my lips and mouth are dry and I have to keep licking my lips, but at the same time, I am swallowing a lot of saliva because it keeps flowing. Maybe I rinsed with this for too long. I read something about how sipping water too often can dry out your mouth by removing important saliva, so maybe that is what&#x27;s happening. If you use any of these products too much, they&#x27;ll remove the salivary lining in your mouth that you need, I guess?</li>
    <li> I like them because of the soothing, cooling nature of the mint.  For me they are great little stress reducer. Most mints are too sweet for my taste (like candy) but this mint is perfect.  Not too sweet, long lasting, cooling, refreshing and a great \\&quot;pick me upper\\&quot;. And yes it does all the other stuff its suppose to do like gets rid of dry mouth and freshens breath. I don&#x27;t mind the price since the product is such a high quality mint.</li>
    <li> If you get a dry mouth, pop one of these in and be amazed as you start to salivate while enjoying a mint.  It&#x27;s kind of tingly on your tongue, and you will salivate.</li>
    <li> I always carry several Lozenges on me, in the car, at home and at work!</li>
    <li> I keep some of these in my purse all the time.  When my mouth is dry, it&#x27;s an instant fix and also freshens the breath.  Each one is wrapped individually and a little hard to open.  That keeps children from thinking they are candy.</li>
    <li> Tasty little mints. SugR free. Seem to help with dry mouth. Plenty of them in the box. Cool refreshing taste.</li>
    <li> I originally found out about these from a sample shipped with an order from another online site. Amazon has the best price with prime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are awesome! I love the taste - doesn&#x27;t taste like orange, it just tastes like mint to me. They are great for after smoking... whether it&#x27;s to get the cigarette smoke out of your mouth, or to help cure the cotton mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are ever suspicious about your breath and need that vote of confidence, pop one in and all your fears are eradicated. This stuff works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the box is a pretty cool dispenser too.</li>
    <li> These are a combination of a dry mouth / fresh breath solution and they work.  I have been addicted to mint candies because my mouth is so dry but I&#x27;ve switched to these lozenges because they do a better job of solving the dry mouth, they taste good, and instead of all that sugary mint it does not cause a boost of sugary calories.</li>
    <li> Product does stimulate saliva; not sure if it helps my breath though.</li>
    <li> unfortunately these did not do the trick for me.  They work no better than candy but with a worse taste and higher price.  And the quest shall go on.</li>
    <li> I have tried every mint on the market and find them all to be sticky and annoying.  These Therabreath Mouth Wetting Lozenges are absolutely amazing!  They are not sticky and they leave my mouth refreshed and moist and able to carry on a conversation without that awful dry mouth lip smacking.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about these as read that dry mouth and bad breath usually originate from the stomach and tongue. Despite scraping my tongue and brushing with neem toothpaste I still sometimes have leftover morning breath. Have taken 5 lozenges so far and each lozenge does last for hrs. Definitely recommend these before social events.</li>
    <li> Gross tasting, threw them out.  Tasted nasty, buy a small amount to try first.  Will not recommend to my patients.</li>
    <li> They are great mints. They say mandarin, but I don&#x27;t taste even a hint of citrus. They are little, strong white square mints. Chewable but its best to let them dissolve. Individually wrapped so easy to grab a few on the way out the door and throw in your purse or pocket.</li>
    <li> Helps my mouth to feel fresh and takes away odor.  I like to take one after a meal if I&#x27;m away from the house.</li>
    <li> I picked up a box of these lozenges at a Walgreens the other day. It was a larger box than this exact product (150 lozenges), but at twice the cost. I asked a guy at the pharmacist desk if he could recommend any good products to kill a garlic or onion smell, and he suggested I try these. See, I know that if I had any bad odors on my breath, I can forget about any hanky-panky with my wife. I knew I was going to need help after my fast food lunch, and I wanted to try to find something that an actual person could recommend to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to say that this product worked, as advertised. Though it didn&#x27;t completely kill the smell of onions on my breath, it did so more than the mouthwash or toothpaste did. I took about four of these in a row and my wife said they were working. Given the success I had with this product, I figured I might as well pass along a recommendation to other who might be in a similar situation. Give this product a try if you are looking for some bad breath relief. Just don&#x27;t stop using that toothpaste and mouthwash, either!</li>
    <li> These are the worst breath mints I&#x27;ve ever tasted.  I bought a large box, tried a few of them, and threw the box away.  What a waste of money.  How do they taste, you&#x27;re wondering?  Initially they taste very sweet, but as you suck on them they get more and more bitter . . . so bitter you have to spit them out.  Do they help sweeten your breath?  I have no idea.  But who in the world is going to want to suck on a foul-tasting breath mint to find out?  A truly terrible product -- and I do not give one star reviews very often, if ever.  I&#x27;d avoid these like the plague.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re the best mint I have ever used.  Even after garlic infused meals just one mint and I&#x27;m really good to go :)</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.</li>
    <li> THese are great little mints for my dry mouth.</li>
    <li> I am on medication that gives me dry mouth and I am a teacher. That was a problem. Not now! This is the best and I have tried another brand of oral care. The other had a terrible taste. This lozenge is nice and refreshing!</li>
    <li> Your mouth will water instantly when you place one of these lozenges on your tongue; INSTANTLY!!  It feels great and tastes great for a dry or tired mouth.  Great for any situation; in the office, working the fields, after dinner.  Makes your mouth fresh and wet and clean.</li>
    <li> These are advertised to relieve dry mouth, thought they might be useful overnight.&lt;br /&gt;They are not, they really don&#x27;t do anything except while they are in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I  threw them away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with dry-mouth for years and this product works great. I was so touched by the seller that wanted to make sure you were pleased with the product and if you weren&#x27;t would do whatever to fix the problem. That means a lot because nowadays people don&#x27;t care. I&#x27;d give 10 stars just for that alone.</li>
    <li> I bit Hard to Open Other Than That Is Good!</li>
    <li> Work well for my dry mouth.</li>
    <li> This product is the best mouth wetter I have ever used, I cannot live without it!</li>
    <li> Powerful and tasty mints. These will freshen my breath no matter how much coffee or spicy food I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from dry mouth for a LONG  time from my under-active thyroid &amp; medication&#x27;s &amp; nothing ever worked to help! It&#x27;s pretty embarrassing when you&#x27;re trying to talk with severe cotton mouth! Try going to the dentist &amp; having to keep your mouth open for 2 hrs!! That was horrible!!&lt;br /&gt;Not even a prescription spray worked!&lt;br /&gt; I tried these the 1st day I got them with a lot of skepticism, and low &amp; behold, they worked!! I&#x27;ll be buying these again!!. Thank you, thank you, Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I am type 2 diabetic which is under control in medical terms. sometimes I get dry mouth during my sleep (especially if i have had a serving of desert with the dinner. This product is godsend. I now sleep every single night with one therabreath lozenge between my cheek and teeth. It lasts for the entire night and I hardly feel its presence during the sleep. And I don&#x27;t get the dry mouth anymore.  It is also a great mouth and breath freshener.  I highly recommend this product. Thank you Dr.Katz.</li>
    <li> Excellent for dry mouth. I like the flavor but others may not.</li>
    <li> Recently I stared a new medication. It gave me a dry mouth. I started to look for help and found this Dr Harold Katz Therabreath mouth wetting Lozenges. They do help. It is pleasant tasting and does help. The tablet is a size that is comfortable and easy to handle. The only problem I had was that I wish the relief would last longer than a couple of hours. Bought thru Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Adds a nice flavor to the mouth, after eating.  Good price for the amount of lozenges included in the box.</li>
    <li> I have dry mouth due to my meds. I ran out of the ACT lozenges so I decided to buy these. I really like their other products like the toothpaste and mouthwash, so I had high hopes for these. They taste awful and they don&#x27;t seem to work. They also have terrible mouthfeel. I liked the ACT lozenges better because they were like hard candy. They actually hurt! I don&#x27;t know why, but they do. They also make everything you taste afterwards taste awful and I have no idea why.</li>
    <li> I like these a lot, but can&#x27;t tell if they really make my breath better. The mouthwash does, however.</li>
    <li> I really like these lozenges.  They are not too strong and are very refreshing.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended these and they are better than having the sugar in Tic Tacs in my mouth all of the time.  The flavor takes a little getting used to, but I like them now.  They also make my mouth feel moist but not slimy.  The price is really good compared to other things on the market and I will be keeping them on hand.</li>
    <li> This product definitely cures my dry mouth.  Since moving to colder weather this helped considerably.  I, also, recommend their mouthwash and toothpaste for the solution.</li>
    <li> These things are good and fairly priced. They relieve dry mouth very well and taste good; however, they are a bit tart. If you have a sensitive mouth,  I suggest measured use of this product. I like it, and carry some with me for occasions when I have to go into a professional building (doctor&#x27;s office, restaurant, department store, etc.) where chewing gum is rather rude. These lozenges work very well in those situations. I&#x27;d recommend them to any one who needs relief from dry mouth or just as a snack during the dayl.</li>
    <li> If you know someone with dry mouth this will help it&#x27;s very strong but it gets the job done and helps with the breath</li>
    <li> This product works as expected with a nice flavor in mouth.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my husband who is undergoing Radiation therapy for Cancer and is having difficulty with dry mouth, these not only taste good but help with the pain of the dry throat and mouth.</li>
    <li> Taste Good.. But didn&#x27;t cure my terrible breath after it was gone.. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it  again.</li>
    <li> These are the superior breath mints. Well worth the price,  you use  less.&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting, refreshing and individual small packs are very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;Most other mints are way to sweet with very little results.</li>
    <li> excellent product. mouth feels refreshed and clean</li>
    <li> The mints are really good. I had radiation to my mouth. which resulted in dry mouth and these really help with saliva</li>
    <li> Mint is too strong.  It burns my tongue.  Might be all right if it came in other flavors, maybe citrus</li>
    <li> My wife and I both really like these lozenges. They taste very good and help keep the dry mouth away.</li>
    <li> All that is said about the good Doctor&#x27;s products are true. They really work and are worth the money! Buying in bulk is the way to go.</li>
    <li> Makes my mouth water in a good way, overcomes garlic and coffee breath. Just wish they weren&#x27;t individually wrapped, they are a bit difficult to get out.</li>
    <li> I keep these by my bedside and use them during the night if I wake up with a dry mouth that a sip of water doesn&#x27;t cure.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, it helps dry mouth symptoms, which is what I need, but it advertised being a Xylitol product which my dentist had recommended, and in fact the main sweetener is Sorbitol.  The second ingredient is Maltodextrin, which can have a negative effect on dental health.  It does contain some Xylitol, and the price is very good.  The individual wrappings on the lozenges is difficult to open.</li>
    <li> I certainly appreciate having a &#x27;go to&#x27; that isn&#x27;t full of sugar, I don&#x27;t have to turn my head and spray it in my mouth and are small enough I can carry discreatly. They are effective. I have struggled with bad breath a lot. My dentist wanted me to stop lodging mints in my mouth because it was causing issues for my teeth on one side. I have a great deal of sinus issues and gastric issues. They have worked well for me. I would gladly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Tried this a few time for dry mouth.  It works OK and does not have a bad after taste. I prefer Biotine over this for nightime dry mouth.</li>
    <li> LV LV the Lozenger.Helps mout driness I can&#x27;t leve without .💖💝💝💝💝💝</li>
    <li> I have radiation induced dry mouth from Cancer treatments. Another side effect of the radiation is that my taste has been severely affected and I have a salty taste in my mouth at all times. These lozenges did help with saliva but gave me such a salty taste that I cannot tolerate them. Now I have an entire box minus one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get the smallest sample that you can to try them.</li>
    <li> Great item. These for sure work the best for dry mouth and id a great combatant to bad breath.</li>
    <li> My Husband and I both use them and think there great</li>
    <li> Nice tasting mints. Mild flavor, but no long lasting relief. I&#x27;ll continue to look for a more effective product.</li>
    <li> I bought this due to my constant dry mouth. It doesn&#x27;t help when you&#x27;re diabetic also.&lt;br /&gt;This will be my second round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does the job, but I have been taking it like it was candy. Well, hehe, it is candy! It does work,&lt;br /&gt;but for those that has a super dry mouth, you will be sucking on these every hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased this item, personally for me, at the full retail price. There&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;no relationship with the seller or the company of this product. Absolutely&lt;br /&gt;there&#x27;s zero compensation involved for my review. I am solely reviewing my&lt;br /&gt;experience for other potential customers.</li>
    <li> A dear person in my life suffers from bad breath and i tried everything else you can think of and nothing worked. These work great!!! I also buy the toothpaste and mouthwash and am so happy with them.</li>
    <li> Great product...fast shipping</li>
    <li> These are great if you have dry mouth and are more minty than sweet, which I really like.</li>
    <li> Love love love.  they have helped me tremendously</li>
    <li> Well, there&#x27;s a lot in the box...they&#x27;re nicely wrapped... a nice size, not too big, like most lozenges. But I got no mandarin orange taste at all. Nada. I just went and tried another. All mint, no orange. The only orange is on the box. The mint is killer strong. Would be great just as a breath mint.</li>
    <li> Just a normal candy mint to me.</li>
    <li> Works great. Everyone at my office always steals them off my desk. They really keep your mouth wet and fresh for a while.</li>
    <li> Works very very well for bad breathe, after dinner/ lunch with family &amp; friends this is a great product for bad breathe ... The only concern I personally had was its to strong for me,,, I dont like strong mints in general, this was to strong for but for occasional use its perfect</li>
    <li> 2nd time I have ordered!  Great!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tasted a hint of mandarin orange in it. The mint is very strong. I&#x27;m not fond of the taste, but it works about as well as any other lozenge I have tried.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I&#x27;m a fan !!!</li>
    <li> Suffer from dry mouth so these lozenges are such a blessing to have avsilable.</li>
    <li> These really help! I have dry mouth from some of my medications and these really do help keep my mouth moist.</li>
    <li> wow. never seen anything work so fast and so good. i&#x27;ll be purchasing these all the time</li>
    <li> These are great! I will definitely be ordering these again soon! They taste great, they are strong, but definitely not overbearing!</li>
    <li> Works great for fresher breath, and tastes good. Appreciate the quick delivery. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love this and keep them around just so I can give it to friends and family, hell, even stranger with that breath that won&#x27;t stop humming and coming at you. For God&#x27;s sake people, give a man some room and let him have his private space. Thank you Therabreath for this product. I will have to suffer no more. I loved it so much I bought your mouthwash for myself. I will never buy anything other than your product. IT ROCKS!!!!</li>
    <li> These are a life saver in the middle of the night when my mouth is like the desert. A whole one is too much (and it wakes me up too much trying to finish it) so I break them in a few pieces and place them in a cup by the bed. I also use a CPAP machine and it&#x27;s simple to just put a piece of it in my mouth.    I also find it&#x27;s great for a breath mint and always carry a few in my pocket.</li>
    <li> While I think this is a good mint for dry mouth, I couldn&#x27;t personally taste the Orange.  It certainly keeps my mouth wet for about an hour or two with is a plus for someone going through Chemo.</li>
    <li> The lozenges really help sooth a dry mouth.  I just found out that a dry mouth can contribute needing a root canal. I just had two done in the last 4 months. I really like the flavor and the freshness I feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I have not received your lozenges yet, I just purchased some at Walgreens.  Your price was less than theirs so I decided to include in my order.</li>
    <li> These dry mouth lozenges did not give long-lasting relief to my dry mouth symptoms and the taste did not appeal to me.  I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> If you like mints, then you will surely love this. Personally I find it a bit too strong, and it&#x27;s always a hassle to get it out of the little plastric wrapping that I end up ripping to shreds because it&#x27;s so difficult to open. I&#x27;d recommend the Xylimelts over this as it&#x27;s not as strong and you can sleep with it since it sticks to the top of your mouth - only thing I don&#x27;t like about them is the little playdo like substance that takes ages to dissolve once the melt itself is gone.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the taste but it doesn&#x27;t last long. It dissolves about in 10 minutes. I would rate 2.5 if I could.</li>
    <li> At first I thought these were kind of chalky in my mouth, however on second or third thought, they are the best mints around. They really get the salyvia going in your mouth, and fix bad breath or dry mouth fully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes wish they had a smaller version for a quick pick me up.</li>
    <li> Great for chronic dry mouth and keeps breath fresh for longer than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.  A tad more expensive than competing products but so well worth it.</li>
