<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is great products, I ordered this for my teenager daughter, she had some acne on her face, after she used Relogy products about a week I can see her skin was very clear and this is my second orders from Amazons.com and ready to order again very soon!!!</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping! I ordered it on Thursday and received on next day. I loved how they were beautifully packaged in a little box like a present. I&#x27;ve been having some adult acnes around chin area and forehead for years.  I tried many acne products in the market. I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv before.  It worked great especially for first 2~3 years, but my blemishes had never been all cleared so I wanted to try the other acne product. I&#x27;ve used Relogy for a week now and so fat it&#x27;s been working really well! When I started using Proactiv, my skin looked terrible...It made my skin super dry and looked like I had a chemical pealing treatment.  It required over two weeks for my skin to get used to the Proactiv. Relogy is much milder to my sensitive skin so I don&#x27;t have any skin pealing problem. I can tell that my chin area&#x27;s blemishes are minimized and my forehead is almost clear now. I especially like Targeted acne treatment!  I can take it to work and apply whenever needed over the makeup. If you have adult acne issues for years like me, it is definitely recommend Relogy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mild/moderate adult acne for the past 5 years. This product didn&#x27;t help, so I&#x27;ll move onto something else...</li>
    <li> This stuff works really well when used correctly. My favorite part is that you can rub the cleanser into your skin and you don&#x27;t have to rinse it off. Doing this seemed to be more effective for me.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product based on the reviews and for the ingredients and was not disappointed at all.  I don’t have bad skin, but a lot of things can break me out. It my skin has been surprisingly under control since starting this and it is has been a very nice product to use everyday.  Based on some of the reviews I was worried about drying but it was not too drying for me — but mind you I use the coconut lotion with it every day just to be sure. You don’t have to rinse off the treatment product which is nice - but I usually do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne my whole life (I&#x27;m 23 now). It&#x27;s been moderate and not severe however I&#x27;ve always been under the care of a dermatologist and have continually used prescription face washes and creams. My skin was clear and glowed because of this so no one ever knew I had acne. Over a year ago I ran out of my prescription items and thinking I was over this acne stuff never got a refill or went to the dermatologist. Needless to say, my acne appeared worse than ever and thanks to my inability to keep my hands to myself so did scars from constantly picking at my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a vegan I generally avoid chemicals at all costs and try to use natural everything so I was determined to beat this fight the organic way! I tried all kinds of oils, serums, masks, lemon juice ect.. to no avail and was beyond depressed with the state of my skin when I remembered this natural acne fighting line. With high hopes I ordered Relogy and started using it immediately. The pen works great and is perhaps my favorite part of the kit. The cleanser is very luxe and foamy while the lotion is also a dream that glides on your face. After 6+ weeks of use of all three products I noticed only a slight difference in my skin&#x27;s clarity. While several large spots were diminished I still had new ones popping up every day. I used this with my Clarisonic as well, so it was as deep a clean you could ever get. Disappointed, I finally took my mom&#x27;s advice and went back to the dermatologist who prescribed me a cream I now use that has successfully cleared my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted this product to be the one that cleared up my skin but I suppose everyone&#x27;s skin is different. I require prescription cream (which my skin has always responded to) so I&#x27;m sticking with that for now. I keep the pen in my purse for an occasional large spot that might come up but I rarely use it.</li>
    <li> I am in Michigan, so the winters here are inevitably tough on the skin. I love this suite of products for helping me keep my skin clean and hydrated. I especially like the moisturizer. It&#x27;s nice and light, I love the smell, and it keeps my skin soft after washing and throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Face wash left my face feeling super clean and had great smell. Blemish stick cleared my blemishes overnight! :)</li>
    <li> With a big family wedding coming up I wanted to look great.  It was also the Holiday Season with lots of chocolate and other no, no&#x27;s.  On the recommendation of a friend I decided to try Relogy Products.  I have very sensitive skin so I was a little nervous.  I applied Step One, the dual action treatment foam.  I used it in place of soap and rinsed it off after applying.  My skin felt so clean and refreshed.  Next of course was the skin balancing lotion.  I applied a small amount to my face gently massaging it in.  My skin was so soft and hydrated.  The product seemed to nourish and kill bacteria not just dry it out as other products do.  As I mentioned it was the holidays so I did have a few breakouts.  The targeted spot treatment came to the rescue!!! Off to the wedding I went with clear glowing skin.  Thank You Relogy!!</li>
    <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve found to clear up the skin. Love the coconut lotion too. Only problem I have is still with the pumps. The last 4 or 5 I&#x27;ve had difficulties with, even if I don&#x27;t press past the line. They work well for awhile, but about mid-way through the bottle it becomes challenging to pump.about other relogy products:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried the lip scrub and like it. Exfoliates great and leaves your lips really smooth. The nightly skin superfood moisturizer I felt was good to use during the winter (it&#x27;s dry where I live), but didn&#x27;t like it too close to my eyes and it felt too much for summertime on my skin, but I&#x27;ll probably get it again for the winter, used in place of the coconut moisturizer at night. I have also recently tried the moroccan clay treatment and I am loving it. It&#x27;s like an extra clear-out-your-pores weekly boost.</li>
    <li> This product is truly amazing! I was recommended Relogy from a friend. I have never used an acne treatment that works and clears my face so well. I use the foam every morning and every night and I love the results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure I WOULD have loved it had I stuck it out longer. I&#x27;ve subsequently learned the HARD way that you need patience, and this acne treatment system is so promising, with such incomparable ingredients, I just don&#x27;t know what I was thinking, not giving it longer to help before I asked for a refund. Which Relogy granted in full without my even having had to return the original order! The company was the EPITOME of courtesy, I&#x27;ve never met with the like!</li>
    <li> My skin becomes dry very easily, especially in the winter so I had been looking for a product that I could use to fight blemishes that didn&#x27;t dry out my skin. My mom introduced me to Relogy and so far I love it. I use everything at night, and it leaves my skin feeling really refreshed and moisturized. I especially like the lotion. A little bit goes a long way and it leaves my skin feeling really clean, which is something I can&#x27;t say about most of the moisturizers that I have used in the past. I will definitely keep using Relogy!</li>
    <li> I LOVE RELOGY!!!! I bought it for my teenage daughter for her acne and after the first week of using it her face looked amazing and glowing so I decided to try it.  Well, I&#x27;m hooked and at 49 years young (lol) I look and feel so refreshed. My skin is so soft and with the cold weather I don&#x27;t have that red patchy look. Thank you Relogy for making me feel like a million bucks.</li>
    <li> This acne fighting system is definitely different than the rest. I find myself washing my face free of make up before using the regimine but have no complaints in doing so since the system is working wonderfully for me. The lotion does a nice job of moisturizing the skin enough to keep it from feeling greasy. I will order more of this product and find myself lucky to have been chosen to receive it for free in exchange for my honest review</li>
    <li> So far, it&#x27;s really not making that big of difference with my skin which is really disappointing. (It&#x27;s been almost 2 weeks) One thing that might contribute to its lack of effectiveness is that I use the cleanser as a cleanser rather than leaving it on, however the cleansing alone dries my skin out and the lotion as part of the package just isn&#x27;t cutting it. I&#x27;m a little frustrated because I bought this after reading about how its good for drier-sensitive skin but the coconut oil stuff doesn&#x27;t provide the moisture my skin needs, particularly in the winter. My skin is kind of flaky, my wrinkles in my forehead look terrible, and my foundation doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly. I&#x27;ve looked at Relogy&#x27;s face creams but jeez, I just spent $50 on this (which is obscene according to my typical budget, I splurged), I just can&#x27;t justify spending another $50 that may or may not help my skin ya know?</li>
    <li> 1 week after the product is working very good,  I love the smell...it dry my skin a little bit; but hey.....is working :)...</li>
    <li> I have used all of these products and I have found that they work great. I like the smell of the lotion &amp; it doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy after applying. I am also using the clay mask.  I especially like this product.  It&#x27;s not heavy &amp; it leaves my skin feeling very smooth.  I will definitely purchase again &amp; try your other products as well</li>
    <li> I have tried those big name acne treatment kits only to have no good results but more irritated, damaged skin. I was given a great opportunity to try this kit at a discounted price and I have to say this really is the one that I have been looking for. I have had really bad skin starting from my mid 20&#x27;s to now my mid 30&#x27;s. All the other products I have tried were to harsh and strong for my skin. This Relogy is great for sensitive skin (I have the Asian sensitive skin) This treatment really helped clear up my skin and the product is so gentle on my skin. There is no redness, stinging and the applicator you apply on those growing acne really works! I would apply them before I go to bed on the areas where I feel and see acne, the next morning they are gone! This is better than the ones you see in the store and on t.v!</li>
    <li> Finally a product that works!!  I have tried every acne product out there, they either don&#x27;t work or make your face dry and flaky.  But not Relogy!  Just try it, you have nothing to lose.</li>
    <li> I got this treatment for a friend. This acne works very well on teenage acne. It&#x27;s easy to use and feels smooth and light when applying. It does dry her skin though. The included lotion helps. It&#x27;s a small price to pay for acne free skin.&lt;br /&gt;I received this item in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> I really hoped this would work because it&#x27;s natural, cruelty free and had great reviews! I used everything as directed for 3 weeks, the first few days my acne (which is moderate) started to clear, then after that my acne came back. The treatment did nothing :( Also the pump on the face wash got jammed and was very difficult to use.</li>
    <li> I started using Relogy in May and the results are astounding!!! This product has actually cleared my acne completely. After trying so many different over the counter products, I must say, Relogy is it for me! I use Relogy in combination with coconut oil and essential oils and that seems to be working for me! Of course I am left with some ugly acne scars, but I&#x27;ve been getting microdermabrasion and slowly my skin is looking better every day! I am so happy to have found Relogy, it has changed my skin for the best!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many acne products and this one seems to work.  It has helped to clear my skin and rid cystic pimples that would try to surface. It did take a couple of weeks before I noticed a difference. Consistency is key. Good Luck!</li>
    <li> My teenage son has more than his fair share of acne for his age.  I have been lucky to meet the owners of this wonderful company and we have tried this product for more than one year.  The results are truly amazing.  Our college age daughter has acne too and over the years we have tried everything including visits to our local dermatologists with marginal results.  This produce makes swift removal of a large portion of their acne and both of them find the daily routine very easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both of my teenagers like many other kids their age don&#x27;t like having a daily regimen but Relogy is really simple to use.  Even as a grown adult I still have very oily skin and I love using the foam before going out for the evening.  It removes and refreshes my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you give this product a try.  You will be very glad you did.</li>
    <li> We were knocked out with how fast Relogy works. Relogy really delivers. Totally recommended. The moisturizer works great for dry irritated skin, too. Happy faces all around!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it existed when I was a kid...</li>
    <li> I did not see any improvement or any difference on my skin and I used it day &amp; before bed as directed.</li>
    <li> This is the only skin care regimen that I look forward to using. The cleanser is refreshing and the lotion is light and soothing. All of the products smell great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the fact that the cleanser goes on, and you just leave it on. It dries in about 30 seconds and leaves a definite super - clean feeling. The lotion seals it in, and I can clearly see how my face actually looks and feels more healthy with these products. Trust me, I wouldn&#x27;t even waste my time writing this review unless it was absolutely deserving of this.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Product works well, but I am SUPER annoyed at the pump for the face wash. No matter what you do, even following the directions on how much to depress the pump, the pump will clog. I have had to clean it once a week, which is a huge pain I  the butt. I also have to waste product when I clean the pump. I wish I could give this a better rating, but I am so annoyed with the pump, I can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I absolutely  loved the face wash in this kit. It did a great job of clearing up my acne. I just did not care for the roller pen or the moisturizer very much. The moisturizer does a good job of moisturizing without leaving your face greasy; however, it has a pretty bad smell to it. It reminded me of the smell of washing a dog, like wet dog and medicated pet shampoo almost. It was definitely pretty bad, and the smell lingers for quite awhile after you put it on. If you can get past the smell, though, it is a good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20s now and have been dealing with moderate acne since I was a teenager; my skin is sensitive, prone to inflammation, and both oil and dry (combination). I&#x27;ve tried so many things over the years with no noticeable success - acne products have always seemed to make my skin tight and dry, and more irritable than cleansing with just a plain bar of soap and water. For a long time I had just given up on finding any sort of &amp;#34;miracle product,&amp;#34; but with my wedding coming up, I was feeling more and more frustrated with the state of my skin, and finally one morning I looked in the mirror and decided to give something new a try. I searched Amazon for highly rated adult acne products and settled on this one. Paid for quick shipping, it showed up in a day or two, and ever since then I am just so happy with how my skin looks and feels. Pimples are healing quickly without the usual dry flakes/dark spots, thanks to the treatment foam and spot corrector. Overall my skin feels wonderful - no irritation or dryness, and the clear patches are actually glowing with health! (Must have the amazing coconut oil lotion to thank for that.) Again, I&#x27;m only two weeks in so we&#x27;ll see how the results are long term, but so far I am a believer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had to give it 5 stars even with the higher price tag - I hope to be able to continue to afford using these awesome products.</li>
    <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s and have tried many skin care products throughout my life.  As I have approached perimenopause, I have developed Rosacea and pimples once again!  I have tried all types of skin care from the most expensive to the cheapest and I am so thrilled that I found Relogy!!  It really is the BEST!!  My daughter also uses it and she is in her early 20&#x27;s and has also had great results. Our skin is sensational!!  We both have used it for almost 2 years now and I would tell anyone at any age, this is the BEST!!  The smell is great, it feels great on your skin, the spot treatment works wonders, the price is right, and my skin overall makes me look and feel many years younger! It is definitely worth it!!</li>
    <li> This is such a nice, simple, affordable skin care line. I&#x27;m a very busy Mom of 3 youngsters who doesn&#x27;t have a whole lot of &#x27;me&#x27; time, nor lots of extra funds in the budget for luxuries. It&#x27;s nice to have a quick and easy, basic two step skin care routine that leaves my skin feeling so pampered and at such an affordable price. The foaming cleanser is light and airy, but very thorough in it&#x27;s cleansing. The moisturizer is the perfect consistency and soaks in quickly, leaving my face feeling refreshed. I rarely get acne, but when I do (stress/time of month), it&#x27;s the nasty cystic type that will usually hang around bugging me for about a week. The spot treatment in this system helps those painful bumps to disappear a lot quicker. I love that this company uses local everything, from packaging to employees and that the product ingredients include nothing toxic or harsh. As busy as I am, I also love not having to think about going to the store buy more product. It just shows up at my door. The company and product are genius in their simplicity, quality, and special touches.</li>
    <li> I have a 14 year old who has not experienced acne before and is very conscious about it.  We bought this product and he is very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am really liking this product trio. I feel like it has helped to clear up my acne on my face, not so much on my back though. I do have to say I wish they had a better quality pump on the face wash. I had to call and get a replacement pump for the facewash before I had even used half of the bottle; the replacement pump also broke. I am now on my second bottle of facewash and had it for about a week and I can tell that the pump is already starting to go out. If the pump was better I would give 5 stars. I just feel like having to pour it out of the bottle instead of using the pump, I am using more of the wash each time than is really needed since it isn&#x27;t foaming through the pump.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff!  The skin balancing lotion is my favorite.  It goes on smooth and light and leaves my skin feeling moisturized all day.  Great products.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter.proactive works well for me but not her.it seems to be clearing up most of her acne.would order again!</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this product to me so I gave it a try. I wish that I would have seen a bigger difference in the blackheads that I get around my nose and chin, but the rest of my skin is looking much better. I did notice that they also sell a clay mask for blackheads so I&#x27;m thinking about buying it, but staying with the product since it has gotten rid of my blemishes. I appreciate the ingredients in this product at least 95% natural as the products smell good, not &amp;#34;chemically&amp;#34; at all, so a plus.</li>
    <li> This did not work for my 15 year old daughter (started using benzaclin &amp; this worked for her) but I am 53 &amp; am very allergic to benzoyl peroxide.  Have been to dermatologist but nothing has worked for me until Relogy.  Have used Relogy for about 4 months &amp; the longer I use it the better my complexion gets.  My blackheads &amp; whiteheads are all almost gone.  My daughter &amp; I both love the lotion.  Am getting ready to order more &amp; am going to try their moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Used this for 2 months and have never seen so many zits in my life. This is NOT from purging because as soon as I stopped using it my face clear dramatically. I now use just coconut oil after I cleanse to take my make up off and my face has improved 90% already.....Don&#x27;t waste your money. Now if you wanted more spots on your face then this is the product for you. I have no idea how they have received such glowing reviews.</li>
    <li> My preteen daughter has broken out into very small tiny little acne bumps on her forehead and chin with bigger pimples on her back. Being an athlete and constantly sweating she has began early preteen acne and she is also menstruating so her hormones are crazy. We have tried over the counter acne medicines but I honestly do not like all the chemicals going into her body through her skin. Our skin is our biggest organ and all these toxic chemicals can be frightening. I found Relogy and read several reviews, mostly positive but I read the negative ones too. She began using it right away and when she is in the shower I come and help her use it on her back. We saw a difference right away. She was so happy and excited and told me that she can make eye contact with her friends now while talking to them. That really made me happy. Now realistically,she still gets small break outs and pimples on her back, but it has slowed down. If she gets a pimple, the next day its smaller, not so red and already drying up. I think that in order to completely not get acne she would have to do some major gut cleansing, and diet change but she&#x27;s only 12. She has received compliments from family regarding her skin. It&#x27;s a really big deal for a teen, its a big deal for anyone of any age to feel confident. I will continue to use Relogy unless the situation gets out of control. I don&#x27;t know where to go from there because I would hate to succumb to the chemical s*** storm products.</li>
    <li> My teenage son had full face breakouts and didn&#x27;t like to clean his face on a regular basis.  His breakouts were especially bad during football season where his helmet contacted his face.  He tried several off the shelf products with no result.  I finally convinced him to use the Relogy products and breakouts are not a problem any more!  Because it is simple to use and fast acting he has stayed with the product and his face has remained clear.  I am so glad I gave him Relogy!  It is an outstanding, fast-acting product that doesn&#x27;t require a lot of steps and time.  Thanks Relogy!</li>
    <li> This stuff is incredible</li>
    <li> Relogy is treatment system which is to be used twice a day to control acne.  Overall the system is easy to use.  You can use the foam to either cleanse your face (wash it off) or leave it on to soak into your skin.  I tried both ways and opted to use it as a cleanser.  My face didn&#x27;t feel as clean as it does when I use my other skin care products.  Also, the foam product had an odd smell.  I can&#x27;t put my finger on what it is, I just know I didn&#x27;t like it.  I think it was supposed to smell fruity or flowery and I didn&#x27;t get that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second step is to use the lotion which I loved the texture of.  It left my skin feeling like silk.  However, I thought the product would help dry up my very oily skin and it didn&#x27;t do that.  There was also a spot treatment stick to use on pimples.  I didn&#x27;t find that to be effective at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I feel the product didn&#x27;t work as well as the marketing indicates.  It&#x27;s possible that I don&#x27;t have acne as bad as I used to in the past.  The instructions also say it could take at least four weeks to see results.  I used it for two for this review, so that could be part of why I didn&#x27;t see as great of results as I thought I should.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product. Works really well for adult acne, the only product I&#x27;ve used that really works. The roll on gel is amazing. Gets rid of acne overnight. My acne was mild however, other products didn&#x27;t work like this one. Has helped prevent and treat hormonal acne during my pregnancy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after I became pregnant and could no longer use the retinoid/antibiotic prescription cream I&#x27;d been using. For an over-the-counter product, this works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before, and I&#x27;ve been dealing with acne for 17 years. The foam seems to dry out my skin if I use it too much, but in that case I just follow the instructions included in the kit that recommends specific ways to cut back. I&#x27;ve definitely seen an improvement in my skin&#x27;s condition and I may consider continuing it after pregnancy because it&#x27;s all natural, less harsh and less expensive than what I was using before. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars just because it&#x27;s not a cure-all, but I really don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything out there that is. I tried Proactiv a long time ago and it was a huge waste of money. Relogy is much better.</li>
    <li> I got this product way before expected shipment I was super excited.  Here I am on day 3 and my skin is already starting to heal.  My pimples are smaller no new ones have formed either.  Especially with the summer heat I am more prone.  The ones that were forming and beginning to surface I just put a little spot treatment over the pump and it shrank! I am so amazed I was feel hopeless and I was tired of mainstream harsh stuff so I didn&#x27;t even bother with proactive.  I have already recommended this to a friend of mine.  Great product.  And the customer service is very informative and speedy reply no waiting 3-7 days like some online stores.  Thanks Relogy!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been to impressed, for the price I paid</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed. Shocked and impressed. I say &amp;#34;shocked&amp;#34; because I&#x27;ve literally tried every acne facial treatment in 20 years that I could find, and shocked that I finally found one that actually WORKS. I struggled with breakouts for so many years and I am finally now only struggling with the healing of old scars instead of hiding new blemishes (as I simply no longer have to deal with &amp;#34;new blemishes&amp;#34;)! The product lasts much longer (quantity wise) than I expected which is an added &amp;#34;bonus&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;ve referred a few of my friends and every single one has been equally pleased. If you&#x27;ve struggled with acne and feel hopeless, please try Relogy. I only wish I had taken a before and after photo so I could &amp;#34;show off&amp;#34; how well this product line works.</li>
    <li> This product actually made my skin worst than before using it. I tried, but every time I used it, I got more zits than I tried to get rid of. Its a waste of money in my opinion and I did make a mistake buying it.</li>
    <li> I love not having to rinse anything off.</li>
    <li> I am 34 and have been struggling with adult acne and have literally tired everything and after 7 years I have found something that really works and fast. I am not one to write reviews but dealing with acne for was ridiculously difficult and I am hoping that I can spare someone from having to deal with it as long as I did. If you have any skin issues try this product, IT IS A GREAT PRODUCT!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Just okay. It&#x27;s not making it better or worse. I think the face wash was good though. It cleans really well. But with the ingredient, you can get a similar face wash for cheaper price.</li>
    <li> I am on my third day of using Relogy to clear up some pretty nasty hormonal acne around my chin and other ares.  I followed directions, only using Relogy once a day as a rinse-off cleanser and then applying it (1/4 pump) after cleansing, and not rinsing.  My skin is really looking good.  This is working faster than I expected.  Mind you, I am also following some of the other suggestions in the skin care guide that came with the product, like washing my pillowcase A LOT and keeping my hair away from my face.  I had one pimple that was emerging on Sunday that has now decreased to almost nothing.  So, to wrap up, I recommend this product with reservations.  It is nice to use a product that doesn&#x27;t bleach your sheets and such because it has no benzoyl peroxide.  I&#x27;m not sure how it will work  months down the line, but so far, so good.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have extremely oily skin and Relogy really helps with controlling oil and reducing the appearance of my large pores.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have seen an increase in acne since using this product.  I have dry skin.  Maybe it works better for those with oily?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After complaining to both Amazon and Relogy about the product and that it was unfair that Relogy has a satisfaction guarantee that is not respected if product is bought through Amazon, I received a refund!  Thank you Relogy for making this right.  I really wanted your product to work, but it made things worse.  After a month of using other \\&quot;All Natural, Organic\\&quot; products, my face is looking better.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product based on the initial reviews that were posted on Amazon and thus far I&#x27;m disappointed with this product after using for two months. Unlike others my acne did Not get worse but it Not improve either. Bottom line, this product does not work.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how impressed I am with the results of Relogy Skin Care Products.&lt;br /&gt;Right after I had my baby, I struggled with acne owing to the hormonal changes my body was going through. Since I had never dealt with adult acne before, I wasn&#x27;t sure where to turn.A friend told me about Relogy on Amazon and decided to give it a try. These products are amazing and really work! I saw results almost immediately! I&#x27;ve been using the two-step facial cleansing system which consists of the dual action treatment foam and the skin balancing lotion with coconut milk. Then,using the Targeted Acne Spot Treatment for spot on treatment of blemishes. I can&#x27;t believe how confidant I feel - I would recommend this to anyone struggling with the same concerns. You will be amazed by the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;K. Conway&lt;br /&gt;Grosse Pointe, Michigan</li>
    <li> I tried Relogy with high hopes after reading the reviews. But after using it for a while, I didn&#x27;t get the results I was hoping for. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I was not overly impressed with this system i did like the lotion though thats the only thing im still using. I went back to aveeno i like that better.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid-30s and still suffer with acne.  So far this system has worked well.  I have already purchased my second set and I&#x27;m loving it.  It has helped with my hormonal acne.  I use step 1, rinse, dry, then reapply without rinsing.  Follow with spot treatment and then step 2.  I do have some dry spots that I have to use a stronger moisturizer on.&lt;br /&gt;Just a note on the pump - I first purchased this March 2015 and then May 2015.  I had problem with the pump getting stuck and not pumping not too long after using the product (both times).  I went ahead and purchased one of those smaller reusable pumps for replacement.  Since the bottle was clear I noticed that the &amp;#34;particles&amp;#34; settled at the bottom when not in use.  Just a slight mix or swoosh of the bottle will mix it all with the liquid.&lt;br /&gt;The company did contact me a few weeks ago about the pump and sent a replacement pump.  That was good customer service.&lt;br /&gt;I do wish that they would sell the bottles separately also.  I purchased my second set since I ran out of Step 1, but still had some Step 2 to use.</li>
    <li> Have tried so many acne prevention and treatment products. I&#x27;m so glad I found this one. It&#x27;s rather pricey, but my son is so happy to finally have clear skin that stays clear. He still gets a few small pimples but they go away within a day instead of turning into those big nasty puss filled zits! His skin looks great</li>
    <li> This is the only product that has ever worked for me. I&#x27;m allergic to certain chemicals and scents this has no scent and is easy to writes off!</li>
    <li> My 13 year old daughter, who is  very busy with dance, has been using Relogy everyday and her skin looks beautiful. It smells great, is non drying and simple to use. She will never be without it. She absolutely loves it.</li>
    <li> This product is great if you have sensitive skin and small blemishes, but I found it no match for my super acne. The roll on applicator made me break out around target site, but the moisturizer worked wonders. I have cystic like pimples and this didn&#x27;t help at all, and the texture for my skin has actually worsened.</li>
    <li> It made my face feel really smooth but I still had the acne and I&#x27;ve been using it for a month.</li>
    <li> I am 28 and have mild breakouts, but a stressful job means more of them.  I found relogy by accident online looking for products and I skeptically bought this because it has a good reputation online, and because people were saying that unlike other skincare programs it does not make your skin worse before it gets&lt;br /&gt; better, and this product doesn&#x27;t do that.  I started using the foam wash 1 to 2 times per day and happy there was no irritation,  my skin honestly looked better right away because this product kind of conditions your skin.  I&#x27;ve seen&lt;br /&gt;consistent improvement within the first couple of days to three weeks. My acne&lt;br /&gt;on jawline and lower forehead (with is where I breakout) is clear now.  The spot treatment on this product is pretty awesome.  The lotion I don&#x27;t really use,&lt;br /&gt;(probably a guy thing), but if I do use it it doesn&#x27;t break me out.  I do think this&lt;br /&gt;product works differently for different people depending on your level of acne.  I live with my cousin and we both use the products differently.  She gets more breakouts than I do so she washes with it 2 times and swears by leaving it on for a minute before rinsing, and that works great for her.  I sometimes just put it on after my shower on dry skin and leave it on for the day, plus spot treatment if I need it.  Also easy to do this on my shoulders if I need to.  A little of this goes a long way so a pretty decent value. Also this does not bleach everything it touches like other acne products or smell like chemicals, a plus.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but in my experience this is a good one to try.  If you post a question I will try to answer.  If I can help I am happy to update on my progress.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with breakouts for a while, nothing has worked until now. I had tried countless acne treatments but none of them helped. When my aunt recommended Relogy I was skeptical at first, but within the first uses my face started to clear up! The lotion doesn&#x27;t make my face greasy, it is easy to keep my routine because it takes only seconds to use. I absolutely love this product and I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product as I was so excited to find a cruelty free acne line. However, it just didn&#x27;t do anything for me. In fact, it dried up my face beyond belief after a few weeks. I saw stellar remarks by other customers and truly hoped I would see the same results. However, I still love the concept of this line and believe they are on their way to something great. I wish it had worked for me but I am glad to see that it worked for so many other individuals!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 22 years old and have been battling adult acne for years. I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv, Murad, Lerosett and I&#x27;ve been put on prescription creams. The more I tried the worse my face got. Finally on a whim I decided to give Relogy a try. Not wanting to waste any more money on super expensive products I decided this was my last attempt. Literally the next day after my first application of Relogy I noticed a difference. My forehead, cheeks, upper lip &amp; chin were covered in cystic acne. Although it hadn&#x27;t magically healed any zits overnight, I noticed my skin had a much brighter and healthier look to it. I&#x27;ve been using Relogy religiously for 3 months and I&#x27;m so grateful I gave it a try. My face is acne free for the first time in years. Now my only concern is getting my scars to fade. Anyone who is struggling with their acne should give Relogy a try! It&#x27;s natural (besides a couple not so good parabens) and it&#x27;s really gentle on the skin! If it can heal my cystic acne (which at times caused my face to swell to the point where I would have to get medical attention) then it can heal any acne problems you might have!! Be patient and be consistent and you&#x27;ll have a success story like mine! I havent felt this good about myself in years!! Thank you Relogy!!!</li>
    <li> I literally started to see a difference within a day. I have been struggling with acne since high school and now 39, I still have break outs which I get worst on my chin and jawline - the major kind that is hard to cover with make-up.  At my age, I shouldn&#x27;t have this.  This stuff has been a life saver. Within 24 hours my skin felt better with less irritation. Within a week, my skin looked so much clearer.    One thing that I like is that I don&#x27;t find that it burns or causes over-drying my skin. I used all three products each application and I use them twice a day. Consistency is key.  If I get lazy and don&#x27;t apply I will get a breakout or more within a day or so!  It doesn&#x27;t take lone to apply, I just keep up with it.  I think in my case, switching to better foundation really helped too.    I have combination skin with dry and oily T-zone.  I think this cleanser actually helped with reducing pore size in those areas.  If you usually have a problem using moisturizers - you will love the lotion- but use only a very small amount as a little goes a long way. I actually only wash the acne prone areas of my face, then use the moisturizer on the dry parts. Then I actually apply the on the spot to my entire chin and any problem areas - it is not too harsh to do so.  Everybody&#x27;s skin is different, but I would say this product is worth a try for anyone.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this product once I read the directions and I saw the foamy formula. It says to only use a quarter size and I thought with the foam that it wouldn&#x27;t be enough to cover my face. When I put it on I was surprised to see that it covered my face and even seemed to get more foamy before finally soaking up into my skin. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works GREAT! I used it a couple of times on my chin and cheeks and I noticed a difference in just a couple of days. My skin looked more clear and it wasn&#x27;t as oily as normal. It wasn&#x27;t dry either. The lotion that comes with it smells great and feels like silk. My skin feels so soft and smooth now. I definitely found my new GO TO product for any acne outbreaks that I might have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I received this product free of charge for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> When I was 21 I started to have an acne problem, I tried EVERYTHING including proactive and even prescription washes but nothing worked for me. After 2 years of battling with my adult Acne I found a prescription gel that helped keep my acne at bay, however it never truly cleared up my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 25 my Husband and I found out we were pregnant. During my pregnancy I had a very hard time controlling my acne, since so many products contain harsh chemicals that are unsafe for the baby. My Aunt suggested I try Relogy because not only is it natural and safe to use, it&#x27;s for acne. I tried it and within 4 weeks my unattractive acne had lightened up and each week after less and less blemishes were on my face. After I had my son I decided to stop using Relogy and go back to my prescription acne gel and within 2 weeks my face broke out so terribly it looked like I had a beard of zits! I decided to go back to Relogy and within 3 weeks my skin was back to normal! My son is now 6 months old and my face has NEVER looked this good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have been battling with Acne or if you just want to use a product that is genuinely healthy for your face I HIGHLY recommend trying Relogy!</li>
    <li> This did not work for my daughter it actually made her acne worse, Disappointed!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely an amazing product!! I am so happy I tried Relogy, it has made a huge difference in my skin issues. I would definitely recommend Relogy Natural Acne Treatment to anyone with an acne problem.</li>
    <li> This product is great - at first I did not believe it could be applied to the face without washing it off (the cleanser) I thought it would dry my skin out, but it didn&#x27;t. The cleaner is very mild but effective. The lotion is great if you have sensitive skin and break out easily due to oily compounds in most lotions.&lt;br /&gt;On another note, if you have clogged skin this system will take a while to work. I recommend combining this treatment with an enzyme peal and micro dermabrazion.</li>
    <li> My 16 yr old is battling with hormonal/teen acne and we have pretty much tried every product out there. We have baskets full of acne stuff including proactive/cleasil/burt bees/neutrogena/murad and some I cant even pronounce -  stashed under the bathroom cabinet to prove. Reviews were good and glad we tried. new pimples are controlled and blemishes seem to lighten up slowly. It&#x27;s not a miracle product but consistency &amp; routine is the key. Try explaining that to an impatient 16 year old who loves make up and forget to wash face on some nights! We are about a little over 4 weeks in, blemishes/acnne are slowly but steadily clearing up. Dry skin may appear with regular use so a good moisturizer is a must. Shea Moisture Face cream we found at Target works well with product. I like that they stand behind the product and offer refund within 60 days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from adult hormonal acne since I gave birth to my son at the age of 19. That was 12 years ago, and I&#x27;ve tried every single product under the sun to no avail. I never had acne or any skin problems when I was a kid. My acne was moderate to severe and this product works! The best thing I can tell u is DO NOT RINSE OFF STEP 1. Just rub it in your face and then the same with step 2. U don&#x27;t even need the last tiny tube of spot treatment unless u have big swollen acne. Because it doesn&#x27;t really work on open or closed comedones. But step 1 &amp; 2 are by far the best products I&#x27;ve used in 12 years.</li>
    <li> Sadly this product did not work on my acne.  I am very sensitive to chemicals on my face and this just made my acne worse and I gave it a good trial time too.  I would have never bought this system if it had (ALL) the ingredients listed and not just the natural ones.  If they are going to state it is natural thats fine but they should post all the ingredients in their products online so we the costumers are not mislead.  Be aware that the face wash has Sodium Laurel Sulfate, Propylen Glycol, Methyl Paraben, Propyl Paraben and FD&amp;C Blue#.  If you are good with these ingredients then give it a try this might work for you. I think the ingredients are not that bad compared to some acne lines but they should list all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/23/14 Company contacted me in regards to not posting all the ingredients and they have updated their product page with all the ingredients listed now and I did want to say that I appreciate them doing this based on my review.  They also refunded me back with no problems.  I give them five stars for correcting the list of ingredients and having great service.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this based on the reviews I read here but unfortunately this system does not work for me. It gave me awful, painful, ugly cystic acne. I tried it for over a month. The first week was good (and this stuff smells good enough to eat!) but then my face started breaking out and got worse and worse. The pump also got stuck on the face wash which was annoying. I switched to the Aveeno Clear Complexion line and my face looks so much better (and all that cystic acne is gone).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently in college, recently I have been breaking out. It could have been the stress or the weather, either way I needed a fix. I had tried many different acne cleansing products and nothing has worked. I decided to try Relogy and within the week I saw results.It also doesn&#x27;t take a lot of time to use, you just lather it on and continue on your way. Although the price is somewhat high, it is definitely worth the extra money. Customer service is also amazing, if you send them an e-mail they get back with you within the half-hour no matter what time it is. Everyone should try this product and if worst comes to worst you can always return it for a free refund.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what my deal is, 30-something and acne has come flooding back like I&#x27;m a teenager again. I&#x27;ve tried just about everything but what&#x27;s worse is I can&#x27;t use really harsh products like I did when I was younger or my skin gets blotchy red, extremely dry and flaky. My face responded positively to this product within the first week. But alas, in about 2 weeks, during &amp;#34;that&amp;#34; hormonal period in every woman&#x27;s life, everything flared back up and didn&#x27;t matter what I did. I left seller feedback lamenting as much and the company emailed me back and made some suggestions on how to use the soap as a lotion, i.e. just leave it on, not wash off. That actually helped. I would wash &amp; rinse my face, towel dry with a paper towel...then apply the foam on the areas of my face with acne, lotion over the areas of my face that are normal/dry.  I still had some breakouts, but not nearly as bad as what I&#x27;ve been plagued with in the past 6 months. The lotion is fantastic. Never, ever have been able to wear face lotion without instant breakout. This lotion has no negative impact on my skin, is very light and neutral smelling. But again, I am very careful to only target my eye area and forehead where I experience the least amount of breakouts and drier in general so I need the lotion there. The &amp;#34;spot treatment&amp;#34; stick did absolutely nothing for me. Let me tell it, if I put it on a pimple, it made it worse by end of day, so I just stopped fooling with that thing altogether. The foam soap and lotion alone worked fine on their own to control my breakouts overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; At this point I&#x27;m out of the foam soap, but I&#x27;m opting to try one other facial wash product before giving this a go. If that doesn&#x27;t pan out, and when I run out of the lotion, I will opt to give this product another shot.  It&#x27;s a shame you can&#x27;t buy the items individually or I would probably by the foam right now but I can&#x27;t justify spending that much to get the set and I still have plenty of the lotion from the first kit I purchased.on from the first kit I purchased.</li>
    <li> I tried other acne products like Proactive and they never worked for me. Relogy worked wonders on my skin and I love that it&#x27;s a natural product. Not to mention, it smells great! I highly recommend Relogy!</li>
    <li> I suffer from bad forehead acne and dry skin. Relogy has cleared my acne pretty well, but not all of it. Plus this product has made my skin super dry. I now have these skin flakes on my face because it is so dry now. Plus when I put the product on my face, it burns my skin!! Totally trying something else.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this stuff to treat my adult acne. Sadly, this stuff has caused a break out each time I have used it. Huge dissapointment. Over the years I have tried a lot of products, most work initially then stop down the road, this one didn&#x27;t do much at all. May want to skip this one or just use water for cleanser.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily and am very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the Relogy products.  I have mild rosacea and can&#x27;t use every brand,but the foam leaves my skin so soft and fresh.  Step 2 is so soothing.  I don&#x27;t get hormonal acne anymore, and my skin is never dry. Best products ever!!</li>
    <li> Great product.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin or make it feel irritated like some acne cleansers.  The lotion is nice also.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy on your skin.</li>
    <li> So far so good! This stuff really seems to be working. I have been using it for a little over a month for adult hormonal acne and my face has really cleared up and without irritation. I have very sensitive skin and have not had any problems with it.</li>
    <li> After a lifetime of no-problem skin, I hit my mid-thirties and adult hormonal acne hit my jawline and cheekbones. Yay? I tried everything, from salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide creams and face washes, to commercial and natural exfoliants, to facial steams and DIY masks, to the Dr. Dennis Gross at-home chemical peel (disaster). Until Relogy, the best results I got were from putting tea-tree oil on my face twice a day, and at night using a toner of water and vitamin-C powder followed by smearing vitamin-E oil and vitamin-A drops on my face. This cleared up the acne a bit, for sure, but really dried out my skin, and the vitamin E/A solution produced some blackheads. I was hesitant to cough up $50 for this product, but I was also desperate. I&#x27;m so glad I did! It really helped, and quickly—I saw noticeable reduction of the jawline acne and almost total clearing of the cheekbones within four days. Oh, the relief. Both steps 1 and 2 dissolve right into the skin, no residue or greasiness, and I&#x27;m all soft and moisturized. Plus, great customer service. The first bottle of step 1 that I received had a defective pump. I contacted Relogy via Amazon, they responded immediately, and they sent me a new pump right away, which works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I typically just use Olay facial moisturizer, but I get the occasional breakout, and thought trying something like this would be beneficial.  (I am 33, so using the over drying acne treatments would destroy my skin.)  Since starting with this, my face has broken out like I have never seen.  I looked like a teenage boy, with blemishes literally covering every inch of my skin where I used the moisturizer.  I am back to basic Olay, and my skin is clearing up nicely.  I hate leaving a negative review, but this stuff destroyed my skin.  It might be different for others, but I was beyond disappointed.</li>
    <li> Made my skin breakout in a red itchy rash and made acne worse. Stuck with it for a month but it was just getting worse. I have sensitive skin but this was horrible.</li>
    <li> My son was breaking out and needed something to help him keep his face clean and free of blemishes. Seems to work good at his acne, has reduced it. Hasn&#x27;t entirely cleared it up , but I think that has to do with how much he uses it.</li>
