      <li>Great Price!</li>
      <li>fragrance was/is delightful.</li>
      <li>The staying power for Stella is not that great though.</li>
      <li>This is a great summer fragrance.  </li>
      <li>You won&#x27;t smell it on yourself, which is a good thing; if you did it means you&#x27;re drenched.</li>
      <li>Makes you feel good all day.  </li>
      <li>The bottle is gorgeous too.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with purchase and the smell is a summery scent of orange blossoms/honey along with others.</li>
      <li>Love the bath and shower gel and body lotion as well!</li>
      <li>Both my wife and I LOVE the fragrance of Stella!  </li>
      <li>I am in love with this scent!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I love it too and am so mesmerized by it - I am putting it on every chance I get!</li>
      <li>Love It!</li>
      <li>but my husband thought this smells amazing</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s warm yet citrusy, n&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>After wearing the sample, I thought it smelled really nice.  </li>
      <li>nice.\\&quot; I&#x27;m not that \\&quot;into\\&quot; perfumes but, it is really nice.</li>
      <li>It is warm and sensual with the sweetness of fragrant orange blossoms.</li>
      <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
      <li>Love the perfume.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this fragrance.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>Nice, light spring scent</li>
      <li>One of my favorite perfumes ever</li>
      <li>increases, you can smell it more.</li>
      <li>Initially, this perfume smells absolutely wonderful.  </li>
      <li>Would love to try them out.  </li>
      <li>Will be on the lookout for more Tocca scents.  </li>
      <li>Stella is such a wonderful scent.  </li>
      <li>I sampled this at Sephora and it smells lovely.</li>
      <li>knows many of the fragrances [both men and women&#x27;s]).  </li>
      <li>This is the best scent in the world; I can&#x27;t get enough of it!</li>
      <li>this is one of my favorite parfum in the world</li>
      <li>Most of the Tocca perfumes are very unique and smell so lovely.</li>
      <li>I love this scent-a bit flowery but not too sweet at all-has a modern sharpness to it-Tocca perfumes are good!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a mature scent, if you even seen a beautiful woman, walk by you and you smell her perfume in the air and wonder what she is wearing, this is that type of scent.</li>
      <li>Not a young girl fragrance but perfect for a sensual woman.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if I have ever been this excited about a perfume before!</li>
      <li>My preference is for uncommon scents and this definitely is one.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great pick-me-up when I&#x27;ve had enough of winter and looking forward to spring and summer.</li>
      <li>Now, I have a new love in my life and it is Stella!</li>
      <li>Sweet and citrusy and light.</li>
      <li>Light but full of body.  </li>
      <li>She was excited to receive it.</li>
      <li>It was a perfect present for a twenty something year old.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a citrus and lily fragrance that is sweet and rich.</li>
      <li>The scent lasts a good 4 hours and at the 8th hour, only someone kissing you would smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love the scent but wish they made a real perfume instead of just cologne.  </li>
      <li>I ordered the full size and got another \\&quot;thumbs up&#x27; from him.  </li>
      <li>Even my hair doesn&#x27;t smell like hairspray (it smells like good shampoo, actually).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be saving this for special occasions that warrant a more sophisticated scent than my daily fragrance oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Her new favorite scent.  </li>
      <li>Warm scent that last.</li>
      <li>After reading so many positive reviews and being a fan of certain citrusy smells and notes, I was certainly intrigued.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light and romantic.  </li>
      <li>The description was correct in saying that it&#x27;s fresh, and I certainly should&#x27;ve listened to that closer.</li>
      <li>It is meant to be worn by a lovely and romantic lady.</li>
      <li>Haha!</li>
      <li>Most commercial colognes/par fumes/blends etc send me into sneezing fits.</li>
      <li>Scents can&#x27;t be described in a review, but I would suggest you go to your nearest sephora, get a sample, and buy on amazon ;)</li>
      <li>Stella is such a lovely perfume.</li>
      <li>Who wants to smell like chemicals?  </li>
      <li>it smells really</li>
      <li>However, I really think you need to smell these in person.</li>
      <li>The staying power appears to be decent, and that&#x27;s the reason I gave it two stars rather than one.</li>
      <li>I must be the first one b/c I certainly dislike this perfume with gusto -- enough to write a review!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very sensitive to odors and smells.</li>
      <li>I have worn this fragrance for years and was no longer able to obtain it from my usual site.  </li>
      <li>My husband loves it and it drives him wild!</li>
      <li>Soft and clean...one of my favorites.</li>
      <li>Really stays on your skin, especially if you layer it with the shower gel and body lotion.</li>
      <li>My husband loves it on me, and I love to small it, just open the bottle and take a smell...</li>
      <li>It is indeed fresh, not sweet or powdery, or musky.</li>
      <li>Very few women I&#x27;ve met wear this scent so it&#x27;s unique.</li>
      <li>Love the subtle layers and lasting power of this perfume.  </li>

<li> I, too, thought that the scent didn&#x27;t last very long</li>
<li> For years my signature scent was Hugo Boss Woman, but it has discontinued for a long time.</li>
<li> I have to say I haven&#x27;t tried that pungent of a smell in a long time.</li>
<li> I am typically drawn to natural, singular fragrance oils and this is a complex, mature scent.  </li>
<li> The scents are so complex and differ from others in the same Tocca line.</li>
<li> I wish I had figured this issue out before I used half the bottle</li>
<li> It is not your typical perfume like you find these days.  </li>
<li> Bottle is tastefully designed and heavy in weight.  </li>
<li> The scent it&#x27;s hard to describe.</li>
<li> Stella-a-a -- rude, obnoxious, and is here to stay.</li>
<li> The orange that I smell is so synthetic that it almost makes me dizzy and nauseated.</li>
<li> It is VERY subtle, but the scent is there.</li>
<li> However, after a few hours, it begins to smell like bad hairspray!  </li>
<li> I hate the other Tocca scents, they smell pungent and disgusting.</li>
<li> The bitterness in it is also unpleasant to me.</li>
<li> After all, who can hate blood orange?</li>
<li> after about 3 hours, they smells like BAD hairspray!  </li>

    <li> Great experience with this seller!  Love the perfume.</li>
    <li> Purchased for daughter-in-law. She was excited to receive it.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of the tocca stella.  After wearing the sample, I thought it smelled really nice.  My boyfriend smelled it (he&#x27;s a perfume efficiandoand knows many of the fragrances [both men and women&#x27;s]).  He immediately said, \\&quot;mmm, what is that!  it smells really nice.\\&quot; I&#x27;m not that \\&quot;into\\&quot; perfumes but, it is really nice. I ordered the full size and got another \\&quot;thumbs up&#x27; from him.  I, too, thought that the scent didn&#x27;t last very long but, when you move around and your body temp. increases, you can smell it more.</li>
    <li> Stella is such a lovely perfume. Most of the Tocca perfumes are very unique and smell so lovely. The staying power for Stella is not that great though.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite perfumes ever</li>
    <li> Really stays on your skin, especially if you layer it with the shower gel and body lotion.</li>
    <li> I sampled this at Sephora and it smells lovely. Scents can&#x27;t be described in a review, but I would suggest you go to your nearest sephora, get a sample, and buy on amazon ;)</li>
    <li> After reading so many positive reviews and being a fan of certain citrusy smells and notes, I was certainly intrigued. After all, who can hate blood orange? I must be the first one b/c I certainly dislike this perfume with gusto -- enough to write a review! I have to say I haven&#x27;t tried that pungent of a smell in a long time. The description was correct in saying that it&#x27;s fresh, and I certainly should&#x27;ve listened to that closer. It is indeed fresh, not sweet or powdery, or musky.

The staying power appears to be decent, and that&#x27;s the reason I gave it two stars rather than one. Stella-a-a -- rude, obnoxious, and is here to stay.</li>
    <li> fragrance was/is delightful. Light but full of body.  Makes you feel good all day.  I always get tons of compliments on the way I smell even from strangers who are walking next to me.  It&#x27;s a keeper!!</li>
    <li> Initially, this perfume smells absolutely wonderful.  However, after a few hours, it begins to smell like bad hairspray!  Who wants to smell like chemicals?  Even my hair doesn&#x27;t smell like hairspray (it smells like good shampoo, actually).  I wish I had figured this issue out before I used half the bottle, otherwise I would have returned it to Sephora and exchanged it for Stella McCartney&#x27;s Stella perfume, which smells like heaven in a bottle!  I will never buy another Tocca perfume.  I&#x27;ve bought two and the issue was the same for both: after about 3 hours, they smells like BAD hairspray!  Yuck!  I definitely recommend you look elsewhere for perfume.</li>
    <li> This is the best scent in the world; I can&#x27;t get enough of it! The initial note is spicey blood,orange which fades into a floral scent. It is VERY subtle, but the scent is there. You won&#x27;t smell it on yourself, which is a good thing; if you did it means you&#x27;re drenched. The scent lasts a good 4 hours and at the 8th hour, only someone kissing you would smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this perfume for the rest of my life. However, I really think you need to smell these in person. The scents are so complex and differ from others in the same Tocca line. I hate the other Tocca scents, they smell pungent and disgusting.</li>
    <li> this is one of my favorite parfum in the world</li>
    <li> My preference is for uncommon scents and this definitely is one. Very few women I&#x27;ve met wear this scent so it&#x27;s unique. It&#x27;s a citrus and lily fragrance that is sweet and rich. Not a young girl fragrance but perfect for a sensual woman. (Blushing a bit but my husband thought this smells amazing and he keeps me well stocked!)</li>
    <li> I have worn this fragrance for years and was no longer able to obtain it from my usual site.  I searched on Amazon and found a seller who sent it promptly and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
    <li> It was a perfect present for a twenty something year old.  Her new favorite scent.  I might buy one for myself.</li>
    <li> Stella is such a wonderful scent.  Will be on the lookout for more Tocca scents.  Would love to try them out.  Bottle is tastefully designed and heavy in weight.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Love the subtle layers and lasting power of this perfume.  I have worn it every day since it arrived. It may just become my signature scent.</li>
    <li> Great Price! Love It!</li>
    <li> This is my go to fragrance. I absolutely love it. Sweet and citrusy and light.</li>
    <li> Warm scent that last. The scent it&#x27;s hard to describe. It&#x27;s warm yet citrusy, n&lt;br /&gt;But not fruity. It&#x27;s a mature scent, if you even seen a beautiful woman, walk by you and you smell her perfume in the air and wonder what she is wearing, this is that type of scent. My husband loves it on me, and I love to small it, just open the bottle and take a smell... Feels like summer.</li>
    <li> I love this scent-a bit flowery but not too sweet at all-has a modern sharpness to it-Tocca perfumes are good!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this scent! For years my signature scent was Hugo Boss Woman, but it has discontinued for a long time. Now, I have a new love in my life and it is Stella! My husband loves it and it drives him wild! I love it too and am so mesmerized by it - I am putting it on every chance I get! Haha! I don&#x27;t know if I have ever been this excited about a perfume before!</li>
    <li> Soft and clean...one of my favorites. Love the bath and shower gel and body lotion as well!</li>
    <li> This is a great summer fragrance.  It&#x27;s very light and romantic.  It&#x27;s a great pick-me-up when I&#x27;ve had enough of winter and looking forward to spring and summer.</li>
    <li> Both my wife and I LOVE the fragrance of Stella!  It is not your typical perfume like you find these days.  It is meant to be worn by a lovely and romantic lady.</li>
    <li> I took a risk on this without testing.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with purchase and the smell is a summery scent of orange blossoms/honey along with others.</li>
    <li> I am typically drawn to natural, singular fragrance oils and this is a complex, mature scent.  It is warm and sensual with the sweetness of fragrant orange blossoms. The bottle is gorgeous too. I&#x27;ll be saving this for special occasions that warrant a more sophisticated scent than my daily fragrance oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very sensitive to odors and smells. Most commercial colognes/par fumes/blends etc send me into sneezing fits. This product does not have that synthetic smell that cheaper scents on the market have.</li>
    <li> Love the scent but wish they made a real perfume instead of just cologne.  It seems to fade quite a bit with time.  I&#x27;ll still keep buying it though!</li>
    <li> Nice, light spring scent</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this fragrance. Every time I step out on the town, I am constantly complimented by my scent. It has an amazing smell.!!!</li>
