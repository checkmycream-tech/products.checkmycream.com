      <li>Just wish CVS and Walmart would carry more than 8 colors where I am</li>

      <li>It was one of her top picks.</li>
      <li>I really love this foundation and if any of the shades match you, go ahead and try it!s</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Based on makeup geek&#x27;s review,  Neutrogena seemed a safe and affordable product to get me through this time.</li>
      <li>Now I am waiting with some nervousness to see if it causes breakouts after a week or so, but I have to write the review now because I LOVE this foundation.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have scars, but i do love the fact that it does have SPF in the formula as well.</li>
      <li>I have tried loads of foundations and this one has been my favorite for a couple of months now.  </li>
      <li>What do I love about it?</li>
      <li>I found that neutrogena foundation is perfect for yellow toned skin types.</li>
      <li>Most of the make up I come across in a drug store like maybelline, loreal, cover girl &amp; etc.</li>
      <li>I really love it.</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>and hopefully the lighter options will work too, because I will most definately be using this from now on.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I end up using hands and brushes most times, sponges gives me literally zero coverage with this one.</li>
      <li>It  provides good coverage ,feels lovely and rarely needs to be touched up .</li>
      <li>I love neutrogena foundations.</li>
      <li>When I first bought this I thought that all Neutrogena products would be \\&quot;good\\&quot; for skin since they make a lot of good acne medications.</li>
      <li>sun protection, light, sheer coverage, and best of all</li>
      <li>Absolutely worth the money, smooth coverage, beautiful finish, even and sort of silky with a very soft nice shine on your highlight areas.</li>
      <li>This would probably suit most light olive skintones, with neutral undertones.</li>
      <li>I like the texture, but the color doesn&#x27;t much with  my skin , seems really light on the web site, but in real more darker...</li>
      <li>I have very fair super sensitive, combination skin and tons of allergies.  </li>
      <li>I usually only splurge on foundation and powder, but maybe saving on this was a good thing!</li>
      <li>It goes on easy and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>I prefer pumps because it&#x27;s easy for me to spill with the minimum time I have in the mornings.</li>
      <li>The only one I could say I liked more was by Prescriptives, and that was a custom blend color that cost almost 6 times more!  </li>
      <li>The first one lasted over 3 months of daily use, which is awesome!  </li>
      <li>And Neutrogena has a fine balance of both.</li>
      <li>when I used this it seemed ok, it was very hydrating and had pretty good coverage.</li>
      <li>gives you light to meduim coverage and that coverage is got for day to day use</li>
      <li>It applies smoothly, but goes where you put it and stays on.</li>
      <li>This make up is good for a natural dewy look.</li>
      <li>I can see on the normal areas of my skin (not oily not dry) where the finish of this product could be incredible!  </li>
      <li>I usually wait a good 3 weeks before writing a review on any face product because sometimes it takes a bit of time to see how really good</li>
      <li>(See My Review) to apply and it gives me a nice glow with almost airbrush finish, I highly recommend this foundation.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great for long wear under powder.</li>
      <li>Normally some foundations are good for oily skin, some are good for dry skin, etc.  </li>
      <li>Amazing natural look!</li>
      <li>It covers my new sun damage beautifully as well as some old spots I have had for awhile.</li>
      <li>I need a very light color (I&#x27;m a natural redhead with blue eyes), so to find one that works for me and doesn&#x27;t leave a line at my jaw is great.  </li>
      <li>After hearing several good things about this makeup product, I decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it would work just as well on face, but I use pressed foundation instead because I have very oily skin.</li>
      <li>I find myself reaching for this product far more often than my MAC liquid foundation that was easily 4 times the price.</li>
      <li>It is super creamy.  </li>
      <li>this may not be enough coverage for you, it&#x27;s light to medium but buildable, One coat is all it takes for me to get a nice coverage</li>
      <li>So this is why I like this product so much: It is affordable, stands up to the sweaty rigors of my job, looks really nice and smooth on skin and feels touchably soft.</li>
      <li>The two go hand in hand very well!!</li>
      <li>myother brand and skin looked really pretty!</li>
      <li>This foundation simultaneously stuck to my dry areas and made them way more noticeable AND made me oily areas look 10 times more shiny.  </li>
      <li>I recently discovered L&#x27;oreal visible lift smooth absolute and LOVE it!</li>
      <li>It is yellow but nor overwhelming and has the slightest hint of pink, so I think it is a great neutral shade.&lt;br</li>
      <li>love that it looks natural and that it gives a dewy complexion.</li>
      <li>was somewhat pleased with Healthy Skin foundation, but I wasn&#x27;t so blown away as to throw out my other foundations.</li>
      <li>This foundation looks the most natural and wears really well.</li>
      <li>I sometimes have a hard time finding the regular Healthy Skin makeup (not Skin-Clearing) at drugstores, so I&#x27;m happy I can order it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Love it and would definitely re purchase.</li>
      <li>Also, this has sunscreen but make sure to put on your on broad-spectrum sunscreen prior, there is no way that a person can use the required amount of sunscreen as a foundation.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s light and not heavy</li>
      <li>This foundation is my first</li>
      <li>I absolutely recommend this to everyone!</li>
      <li>As for it promoting healthy skin, I don&#x27;t think any foundation can actually do anything like they claim except even the skintone on application.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a very fresh and natural looking foundation..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have tried loads of foundations and this one has been my favorite for a couple of months now.  I have very dry skin, so in the winter, a foundation like this is fantastic.  It is super creamy.  A tiny bit of foundation goes a very long way. It has a dewey finish and it lasts all day even without setting my entire face with powder.  The packaging is good. It comes in a heavy glass container.  It doesn&#x27;t have a pump, but not many drug store products do.  The foundation comes in a range of colors, so I have a couple different tones on hand to mix together throughout the year.  I find myself reaching for this product far more often than my MAC liquid foundation that was easily 4 times the price.</li>
    <li> Drugstore foundations are a total bust. There are no try me&#x27;s or color matches, so you kind of just go in hoping the drugstore gods will have a color for you. This is  no different, there are 12 total shades; obviously, the human race will never be able to match only 12 shades and so the darker skin tones will not find a match with this foundation unless they mix it with another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, that is the only flaw I can see in this foundation ( a common one for drugstores). I did find a match for my skintone and it was number 40, nude. This would probably suit most light olive skintones, with neutral undertones. It is yellow but nor overwhelming and has the slightest hint of pink, so I think it is a great neutral shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application is simple and easy, you can use any make-up tool you wish: hands, brushes, sponges, etc. I end up using hands and brushes most times, sponges gives me literally zero coverage with this one. It blends very well, and is almost like applying silk to the skin. It feels great and light on the skin. I have dry skin, and the only part of me that this leaves a non-matte finish is my nose, but I still powder my face to set it. Also, I only apply one layer because most liquid foundations emphasize the dry patches on my skin, but it is build-able to a medium coverage if you so desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell of this foundation, most foundations usually have this weird cheap waxy scent to them. This one, has a pleasant scent on application. It might bother some, but I rather like it. As for it promoting healthy skin, I don&#x27;t think any foundation can actually do anything like they claim except even the skintone on application. Also, this has sunscreen but make sure to put on your on broad-spectrum sunscreen prior, there is no way that a person can use the required amount of sunscreen as a foundation. Also because it has sunscreen, do not wear this at night; it will give you a ghost white appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this is my everyday foundation when I wear it for casual purposes. I really love this foundation and if any of the shades match you, go ahead and try it!s is my everyday foundation when I wear it for casual purposes. I really love this foundation and if any of the shades match you, go ahead and try it!</li>
    <li> When I first bought this I thought that all Neutrogena products would be \\&quot;good\\&quot; for skin since they make a lot of good acne medications. Wow I was so wrong, at first when I used this it seemed ok, it was very hydrating and had pretty good coverage. However after about two or three weeks of this, I started to develop these little bumps all over my face, which I have never had before. They weren&#x27;t inflamed at all but during midterm and finals week (i.e. stress) they became full blown cysts and red zits! I couldn&#x27;t figure out what caused it until I started looking at everything I used before my breakout. If you look in the ingredients there&#x27;s something called \\&quot;Ethylhexyl Palmitate\\&quot; which is derived from coconut oil. Look it up and you&#x27;ll see that it&#x27;s comedogenic i.e. causes acne. Now some people may use this and not have breakouts at all but if you&#x27;re like me with sensitive, acne-prone skin please look at the ingredients beforehand and don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did...</li>
    <li> It goes on easy and lasts all day. The color is as expected and I love the SPF20 in it.</li>
    <li> This make up is good for a natural dewy look. I have this in 120 Tan and it is awesome. The consistency is quite runny... and it feels more like a lotion. I try to apply it with my normal make up brush but it doesn&#x27;t work well. This foundation is something like a lotion and well... Imagine trying to use a make up brush to put lotion on your face.. It just doesn&#x27;t work well with brushes for some reason... And Idk why... So, for me, this foundation needs to be applied with hands. It&#x27;s like a tinted moisturizer that provides a little bit more coverage than the average tinted foundation. I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t cover my blemishes and acne scars but it did... Really well. It also keeps your face moisturized and hydrated. I would definitely recommend this product for dry or combination skin. As far as the color and tone... I love it! It blends with my skin nicely and it never looks like I am wearing a mask of make up with the wrong shade. I found that neutrogena foundation is perfect for yellow toned skin types. Most of the make up I come across in a drug store like maybelline, loreal, cover girl &amp; etc. has way too much of a red tone for me. My skin is pretty neutral like it&#x27;s not red toned but it&#x27;s not overly yellow either... And Neutrogena has a fine balance of both. It doesn&#x27;t settle in my laugh/smile lines... It&#x27;s just a very fresh and natural looking foundation.. I love it. I would purchase this product again..</li>
    <li> This is a great foundation  but this particular shade has a yellowish undertone .  It  provides good coverage ,feels lovely and rarely needs to be touched up .</li>
    <li> Granted, everyone&#x27;s skin is different. I am very fair-skinned with a clear (but sensitive and slightly dry) complexion. My skin is so light that any imperfection becomes apparent, so I use a liquid foundation just to even things out a bit. This foundation looks the most natural and wears really well. I&#x27;ve tried a number of more expensive products but they all seem to dry out my skin. So, for anyone who has fair, sensitive, and dry skin, I would recommend this over products that cost 2-3 times as much. Whatever works, works...despite the price!</li>
    <li> For my very sensitive combination skin, my dermatologist recommended I wear Neutrogena makeup, or no makeup at all. I&#x27;ve been using the Healthy Skin makeup for over 10 years. It&#x27;s everything I want in a makeup: sun protection, light, sheer coverage, and best of all, it doesn&#x27;t aggravate my skin. I sometimes have a hard time finding the regular Healthy Skin makeup (not Skin-Clearing) at drugstores, so I&#x27;m happy I can order it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this foundation, but it is just too hard to use. It feels very thick on my face and it&#x27;s very hard to spread it evenly around your face. I tried using my fingers, a sponge, and a brush but nothing helped. I may add a little bit of water to thin it out? The color was a nice match though... I am very pale so it&#x27;s hard to find foundations that match.    I also don&#x27;t like the smell of this foundation. I recently discovered L&#x27;oreal visible lift smooth absolute and LOVE it! So if u had similar problems with this foundations, I recommend trying that:[...]</li>
    <li> I bought this because I read it was recommend for dry skin and I found it clung to my flaky patches pretty bad (which may just be because my skin is way to dry for any drugstore fondation. I have some pretty bad dry flaky spots). I&#x27;ll keep it for summer because I really like it otherwise. But if you have similar problems its not for you</li>
    <li> Feels good on and does not aggravate my acne prone skin.  Provides enough coverage to even out skin and offers some sun protection.  Have been using this for years (recently the packaging changed.)  Tried other drug store brands and other Neutrogena bases but I always come back to this.  Just wish CVS and Walmart would carry more than 8 colors where I am --- I ended up buying two colors and mixing.  It&#x27;s a bit of a pain and more expensive in one go.  Other stores used to carry more colors but, even then, Neutrogena colors tend to be too pink for me --- I don&#x27;t love my yellow-y complexion but I want my makeup to blend rather than look like a mask with a different skin color from the neck down.</li>
    <li> Loving this makeup. I was stuck between buying this and my good ol&#x27; Revlon Colorstay. I wanted to try something new, but this is a new favourite! I apply it after i wash my face and moisturize, with an elf foundation brush. It applies smoothly, but goes where you put it and stays on. Color stays nicely, and is amazing at holding onto powder. I have oily skin and use Clinique powder on this, and Almay smartshade to tone down my blush. I usually only splurge on foundation and powder, but maybe saving on this was a good thing! Amazing natural look!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this foundation. Bought it initially because it was suggested to me as a dupe for a much more expensive foundation and it truly is. Absolutely worth the money, smooth coverage, beautiful finish, even and sort of silky with a very soft nice shine on your highlight areas. Love it and would definitely re purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few Neutrogena products in the past...facewash, sunblock, you name it. I hadn&#x27;t tried any of their make-up before and since I loove their other lines, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was somewhat pleased with Healthy Skin foundation, but I wasn&#x27;t so blown away as to throw out my other foundations. I thought it was too runny and a strange consistency. It provides very light coverage..almost too little. (I had to wear concealor under it). The shade does blend nicely and matched my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I will buy this in the future, but I don&#x27;t think its all that bad either. Just a so so foundation.Give it a try, you may like it.</li>
    <li> Amazing consistency. Long lasting but not too dry. Dewy but not too oily &amp;#60;3 I absolutely recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> Normally some foundations are good for oily skin, some are good for dry skin, etc.  I have combo skin, so I have one or two dry areas on my cheeks and between my brows, but an oily nose area.  This foundation simultaneously stuck to my dry areas and made them way more noticeable AND made me oily areas look 10 times more shiny.  I tried it with primers, tried applying it with fingers, beauty blenders, and buffer brushes and still none of it worked.  Even when my skin isn&#x27;t dry and flaky, the formula of this foundation just seemed to really emphasize oiliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really a shame that this product did not work for me.  I know it does work for a lot of people.  Also, what I can say great out this foundation is the finish.  I can see on the normal areas of my skin (not oily not dry) where the finish of this product could be incredible!  When they say liquid skin, they mean it, that is the texture this foundation could finish to for normal skinned people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As one of the more expensive foundations on the drugstore shelves, I say proceed with caution if you have anything other normal skin.  But I am aware that makeup is personal and everyone has different experiences with these products.  Which is why I won&#x27;t give it only 1 star, because I could see where this product could work for someone else, it just did not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to note, my shade is classic ivory.  Other foundations that DO work for me are Revlon Colorstay, the one for oily skin, and Covergirl Outlast 3-1 (when it doesn&#x27;t oxidize).  Hope that helps some of y&#x27;all out.</li>
    <li> It is a bit thick for my liking (I don&#x27;t like wearing make up) but with a horrible habit of picking at my face, it covers blemishes wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I just bought my second bottle of neutrogena healthy skin, classic ivory 10, last night.  The first one lasted over 3 months of daily use, which is awesome!  I had used Bobbi Brown for nearly 15 years and decided I could not justify. pending nearly $40 for half as much product.  I have very fair super sensitive, combination skin and tons of allergies.  I have tried other drug store foundation but could never get the right combination of color and non irritating ingredients.  As a teen, I thought that I had acne prone skin and when to the dermatologist and everything, and nothing worked.  When I finally went to a allergist and stopped using all the harsh cleansers my skin cleared up.  Buying makeup at the drug/grocery store can be challenging but, check out the return policy and sometimes it takes a couple tries to find what works for you.  Some grocery stores are setting up cosmetics counters more like&lt;br /&gt;department stores to make the process easier.  I would recommend buying your first bottle locally to make the testing process easier and after that shop the deals.  This time I bought at target ($11.99 &amp; a buy 2 get $3 off coupon.)  For those that are \\&quot;acne prone\\&quot; test a little on the inside of your wrist first, try to leave it on as long as you would wear it on your face.  If it irritates your skin don&#x27;t use it on yoru face.  At least that way you can limit some of the potential for breakouts.</li>
    <li> I use this liquid makeup only on my chest to help even skin tone and provide sunscreen. I&#x27;m sure it would work just as well on face, but I use pressed foundation instead because I have very oily skin.</li>
    <li> Gives good coverage of age spots and acne without feeling like anything at all. Also not oily and won&#x27;t break your skin out. This stuff is great for long wear under powder. love it.</li>
    <li> Its soo amazing for school , work , or every day use it&#x27;s light and not heavy gives you light to meduim coverage and that coverage is got for day to day use simply it&#x27;s AWOSEME  you should  get it ...</li>
    <li> I have used quite a variety of foundation over the years, and this one takes the cake for being a drug store brand.  The only one I could say I liked more was by Prescriptives, and that was a custom blend color that cost almost 6 times more!  I need a very light color (I&#x27;m a natural redhead with blue eyes), so to find one that works for me and doesn&#x27;t leave a line at my jaw is great.  Plus it&#x27;s got spf20 built in,  which always helps me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m reviewing on my dad&#x27;s account. This foundation is my first and it&#x27;s really great. It smells lovely and i find that if i pat it on like i do with BB creams, the coverage is even better. Sadly, this doesn&#x27;t work well with my forehead since it&#x27;s darker and dryer but it still works wonders. I don&#x27;t have scars, but i do love the fact that it does have SPF in the formula as well. I just use the number 80 which i think is Medium Beige just about every day. It does however, smear in the summertime and when you sweat, so i would recommend it in the winter. I set it with a Maybelline dream matte powder. The two go hand in hand very well!! Would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love neutrogena foundations. I consistently go back to using this one but will also use the shine control one at times. I have explored high end foundations but for the money this is perfect. I also have a few makeup &amp;#34;snob&amp;#34;  friends that use a lot of department store makeup but use this as their base. Thumbs up from me!</li>
    <li> I usually wait a good 3 weeks before writing a review on any face product because sometimes it takes a bit of time to see how really good a product is. I am writing this after wearing foundation 2 days! I have worn Lancome and Clinique. Any other foundation has either looked awful on my skin or caused allergic reactions. I have been using Clinique the last 4 years but I haven&#x27;t been happy with the color or the look of it on skin. Plus it felt heavy to me. I have a strenuous job in Texas heat and after working  you could see that sweating was causing foundation to get real blotchy. So i read about this Neutrogena product on makeup geek&#x27;s website. It was one of her top picks. I was looking for a temporary affordable foundation because a trip to Cabo left me so dark and my over 50 skin suffered serious hyper pigmetation all over face. I needed a quick fix to blend and cover these areas until I lost the tan and came back to my usual fair skin. Based on makeup geek&#x27;s review,  Neutrogena seemed a safe and affordable product to get me through this time. I usually know right away if my sensitive skin will have a problem with new product. So far, in 2 days, no reactions. Now I am waiting with some nervousness to see if it causes breakouts after a week or so, but I have to write the review now because I LOVE this foundation. What do I love about it? It covers my new sun damage beautifully as well as some old spots I have had for awhile. It feels so soft on skin and not heavy or sticky. I put it on with fingers and patting motion. Color is acceptable but I look forward to being fair again and hopefully the lighter options will work too, because I will most definately be using this from now on. The feel of it is sooo nice!  After unloading trucks tonight in Texas heat i did use a towel to gently mop perspiration from face and i did not see too much color transfer. What really sold me was what I looked like after checking face in mirror. I didn&#x27;t have that spotty look as with myother brand and skin looked really pretty! Foundation didnt settle in creases !&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;m cooled down my face feels silky soft! I usually feel so salty and dirty on face, but this still feels nice! So this is why I like this product so much: It is affordable, stands up to the sweaty rigors of my job, looks really nice and smooth on skin and feels touchably soft. I have paired it with Neutrogena face powder as well because it is a little Dewey looking, which I normally love.However, when I know I am going to perspire I use a powder over it. The powder beats my Clinique powder too! LOVE THIS PRODUCT! Will update if  any problems!</li>
    <li> I like the texture, but the color doesn&#x27;t much with  my skin , seems really light on the web site, but in real more darker...</li>
    <li> It took me allot of reviews later but I finally tried this for myself and man I love this stuff. I have combination skin, Mostly dry with hormonal acne. This foundation gives me medium coverage and makes my skin look great!!! This has not broken me out so far even with the SPF (SPF in makeup tends to break me out) I don&#x27;t have acne all the time and my skin is pretty clear but I do have large pores around my nose, chin and forhead and this covers them. I use the Sonya Kushuk Flat Top Kabuki brush (See My Review) to apply and it gives me a nice glow with almost airbrush finish, I highly recommend this foundation. Will never go back to a high end again and I have tried them all! I will say if you have allot of dark marks and acne this may not be enough coverage for you, it&#x27;s light to medium but buildable, One coat is all it takes for me to get a nice coverage but I don&#x27;t have problem skin. I have fair skin with pink undertones and this line is built around my skin color, But if you have yellow undertones, It may not be the foundation for you. They really need to come out with more shade selection for you olive toned and dark skin beauties, That is the only issue I can come up with. But for me it&#x27;s AMAZING!</li>
    <li> This product has Titanium Dioxide, I had ordered one without that and got this.</li>
    <li> This was the perfect match for my face (I always end up going too dark). It isn&#x27;t too greasy and has a nice thick creamy feel to it, plus it protects my face from the sun! My only problem with it is the bottle, a lot of it comes out quick and it can get messy if you&#x27;re not careful!</li>
    <li> I have adult-onset acne on my forehead and cheeks, so I bought this because it was advertised as non-comedogenic. I really love it. I don&#x27;t see flare ups or blemishes with this product like I did others. Also, I am as white as they come, so to finally find a truly &amp;#34;ivory&amp;#34; product that wasn&#x27;t dark on me was a blessing. Will continue to buy it and use it.</li>
    <li> After hearing several good things about this makeup product, I decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it looks natural and that it gives a dewy complexion. Those are both things I crave.&lt;br /&gt;I actually have had no problems applying this with a makeup brush. It does feel like a lotion, so it will make your skin super soft. Coverage is minimal, so concealer would be needed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have is the bottle. I prefer pumps because it&#x27;s easy for me to spill with the minimum time I have in the mornings. I like to put it on my wrist to warm the makeup up, so this was a bit tricky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it in Classic Ivory, and it seems to match my skin tone well.</li>
