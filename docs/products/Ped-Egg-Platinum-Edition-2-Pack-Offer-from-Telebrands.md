      <li>I am pleased.</li>
      <li>and they look better than they have in years.  </li>
      <li>My suggestion is to by a better product.</li>
      <li>The finishing pads are a very nice addition and work very well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good thing to have handy if you get dry feet, and this is as good a deal as any when you&#x27;re looking to buy them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I feel like this is a pretty good value considering the number of emory pads you get along with the two Ped Eggs.</li>
      <li>And are very easy to clean.</li>
      <li>This is a great product to have if you care about your feet being smooth and soft, it does the job.</li>
      <li>This product has worked really well with making feet look nice really easily and safely.  </li>
      <li>I no longer have callused feet and the Ped Egg is easy to use/clean out.</li>
      <li>They work fine</li>
      <li>Each blade works fine, though I have a feeling that I won&#x27;t need to replace the blade that often.</li>
      <li>my feet are happy once more, and I&#x27;m elated that it&#x27;ll probably be a long time before I have to buy another.</li>
      <li>Black color might not be the best, however, because it shows the skin dust and filings ...</li>
      <li>Price is outstanding, and shipment was quick.</li>
      <li>Filed away immediately after receiving it in the mail and my heels are smooth with feeling again.</li>
      <li>The ped egg is absolutely worth the $10 at the store but who doesn&#x27;t love getting something cheaper when you can?</li>
      <li>use on clean feet and sooo portable and easy to use.</li>
      <li>My feet have NEVER been this smooth.  </li>
      <li>Just have to make sure you don&#x27;t overdo it and reduce the right areas.</li>
      <li>and soaking your feet first helps some as well; they work fine.</li>
      <li>I absolutely loved ped egg when I first starting using it over 5 years ago.  </li>
      <li>i originally purchased the item when it first came out and couldn&#x27;t find it.  </li>
      <li>I had bought a Ped Egg back when it had first made its debut, and it was possibly the best thing that could have happened to my feet.</li>
      <li>When you cannot get to the salon or cannot afford it my feet are smooth and summer ready.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money</li>
      <li>I then use a good quality foot cream and my heels are now &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; versus rough.</li>
      <li>My husband is not one to use extra things such as this or lotions or what have you, but when he tried the Ped Egg on his calloused feet he loved it!</li>
      <li>Very pleased with these ped eggs - they are additional ones to the single I have had for some time.</li>
      <li>feels just right in my hand</li>
      <li>get 2 items right out of the box(no need to order 2 of them since anyone rarily does it untill one gets lost</li>
      <li>Price is right.  </li>
      <li>I ordered and received 3 new Ped Egg Platinums in a very quick shipping window.  </li>
      <li>Used it for about a week or two, easy to clean, use it gently as it is easy to overdo it when getting those callouses pared down.</li>
      <li>I have a job where I&#x27;m walking around most of the day, and I tried all sorts of things to decrease the obvious wear on the feet without much success.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s something that I very much neeeded.</li>
      <li>The top and bottom pieces to the ped egg do not stick together so it constantly falls apart in your hand while you&#x27;re using it.</li>
      <li>The buffer-like emery side that is black (like fine grade sandpaper) is what keeps my heels and big toe area nice and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Ped Egg!</li>
      <li>But my foot was really peeling (TMI I know!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>It works very well and for those that are runners, hikers, and very active, it really helps keep your heels nice and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Much more effective than regular pumice pads, stones and rough stickers on plastic handles!  </li>
      <li>I expected this product to work a lot better than it does, I think that it work well on less calloused feet however it doesnt work well on fairly calloused feet.</li>
      <li>I use to buy a new ped egg after maybe 6 months of use, to replace it with a newer one that would generally work better.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s when I decided to buy a new one, and I&#x27;m glad I found this one, because it not only brought one of the miraculous Ped Egg, it brought two!</li>
      <li>We have been getting Ped Egg for 3 years and absolutely swear by them.</li>
      <li>Thanks,</li>
      <li>Because it is a real &#x27;blade&#x27; /</li>
      <li>These work very well.</li>
      <li>This product works very well (on humans) and is inexpensive.  </li>
      <li>My feet are so much softer now.</li>
      <li>This really does work.  </li>
      <li>File wears out fast.</li>
      <li>These ped eggs are actually smaller than the original Ped Egg that I purchased.  </li>
      <li>I guess all good things must eventually come to an end, because after many years of loyal service from my little Ped Egg, it bid me its farewell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time kept passing without my Ped Egg, and soon enough, my feet were thoroughly missing it!</li>
      <li>Good product--it does exactly what it claims to do--remove dead, dry skin from your feet.  </li>
      <li>Be careful because it would be easy to overdo it.  </li>
      <li>My feet were no longer rough and were as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
      <li>--it is a &amp;#34;micro-planer&amp;#34; for the feet, but the design is cute &amp; the &amp;#34;collection&amp;#34; tray for the dead skin is a clever/pleasant solution to disposing of the &amp;#34;dead</li>
      <li>They shipped out 2 new sets within a day or two, and fortunately these replacements were sharp.  </li>
      <li>I have found this Ped Egg to be like the professional version I first bought several years ago.  </li>
      <li>The item took the full amount of time to be shipped to my house and it came with extra blades which I wasn&#x27;t expecting (possibly missed reading this when ordered so I was suprised!)</li>
      <li>The newer ped eggs do not seem to work as well as the old ones.  </li>
      <li>I have one ped egg that is old but still working well.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know how my daughter&#x27;s and my feet could survive and be presentable without them!!  We have been getting Ped Egg for 3 years and absolutely swear by them.</li>
    <li> I expected this product to work a lot better than it does, I think that it work well on less calloused feet however it doesnt work well on fairly calloused feet.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of the Ped Egg products.  I have a job where I&#x27;m walking around most of the day, and I tried all sorts of things to decrease the obvious wear on the feet without much success.  This product has worked really well with making feet look nice really easily and safely.  My only warning is that I would recommend to use it over a towel or tub because not 100% of the filings get caught by the case.</li>
    <li> I like to walk around on my bare feet and there are consequences for that in the way of rough heels. Filed away immediately after receiving it in the mail and my heels are smooth with feeling again. I can&#x27;t praise this enough. The filings can fall back out through the micro-plane if you hold it filing downwards, but that isn&#x27;t a big deal. It&#x27;s still cleaner than the traditional stones you would normally use for this purpose. The finishing pads are a very nice addition and work very well. Price is outstanding, and shipment was quick. If you have rough heels, just get this.</li>
    <li> I ordered and received 3 new Ped Egg Platinums in a very quick shipping window.  Unfortunately, 2 of the 3 blades were pretty dull (also experienced similar quality from other B&amp;M retailers; must be the manufacturer).  I emailed customer service, and they responded within an hour.  They shipped out 2 new sets within a day or two, and fortunately these replacements were sharp.  I would definitely buy from this retailer again; they provide great customer service!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Good product--it does exactly what it claims to do--remove dead, dry skin from your feet.  Nothing glamorous about it--it is a &amp;#34;micro-planer&amp;#34; for the feet, but the design is cute &amp; the &amp;#34;collection&amp;#34; tray for the dead skin is a clever/pleasant solution to disposing of the &amp;#34;dead skin&amp;#34;--YUCK !  Because it is a real &#x27;blade&#x27; / a cutting tool, you need to be careful how much you &amp;#34;plane&amp;#34; off your feet/callouses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a really good treatment in the ongoing battle of taking care of your feet.</li>
    <li> This product works very well (on humans) and is inexpensive.  My great dane has hyperkeritosis of the pads of her paws and it seems to be helping her as well.</li>
    <li> My husband is not one to use extra things such as this or lotions or what have you, but when he tried the Ped Egg on his calloused feet he loved it! This is my second purchase of the Ped Egg for him as he uses it alot. It definitely takes off the dry dead skin and leaves your feet baby soft. Thanks Ped Egg!</li>
    <li> At first I was very skeptical to buy this product. I had been contemplating buying it in the store for a week or so but couldn&#x27;t bare spending $10 on an item now knowing if it would work! I got on Amazon and found it for a great price (under $3) and it had the majority of good reviews. So I jumped on it with only $2 shipping! The item took the full amount of time to be shipped to my house and it came with extra blades which I wasn&#x27;t expecting (possibly missed reading this when ordered so I was suprised!) I was a little scared to use the product at first, I mean who really wants to put a sharp blade on to their feet PURPOSLY?! But my foot was really peeling (TMI I know! Sorry!) and it was itching like crazy! I it and LOVE IT. It is very soft doesn&#x27;t feel like a blade at all, and it gets the skin off in tiny particles (which can be a little messy if you accidently flip the ped egg over the wrong way). The ped egg is absolutely worth the $10 at the store but who doesn&#x27;t love getting something cheaper when you can? Great job I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> I had bought a Ped Egg back when it had first made its debut, and it was possibly the best thing that could have happened to my feet. My feet were no longer rough and were as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. Hooray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I guess all good things must eventually come to an end, because after many years of loyal service from my little Ped Egg, it bid me its farewell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time kept passing without my Ped Egg, and soon enough, my feet were thoroughly missing it! I hadn&#x27;t realized how essential it had become to keeping my feet looking and feeling wonderful. That&#x27;s when I decided to buy a new one, and I&#x27;m glad I found this one, because it not only brought one of the miraculous Ped Egg, it brought two! And the price was totally great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my feet are happy once more, and I&#x27;m elated that it&#x27;ll probably be a long time before I have to buy another.</li>
    <li> I have found this Ped Egg to be like the professional version I first bought several years ago.  I will pack one in my travel bag now.  It works very well and for those that are runners, hikers, and very active, it really helps keep your heels nice and smooth.  I use the metal portion when my heels are getting rough and then the buffing side to finish smoothing over the surace.  The buffer-like emery side that is black (like fine grade sandpaper) is what keeps my heels and big toe area nice and smooth.  I then use a good quality foot cream and my heels are now &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; versus rough.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted for my feet.  Price is right.  No fancy colors.  Emerald pad good to smooth out after use.</li>
    <li> This really does work.  Be careful because it would be easy to overdo it.  Finally, a product that does what they claim!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as advertised or expected. Wish I would have not purchased as iris terribly ineffective.  My suggestion is to by a better product.</li>
    <li> Item works well, blades are sharp enough to reduce dry skin.  Just have to make sure you don&#x27;t overdo it and reduce the right areas.</li>
    <li> . use on clean feet and sooo portable and easy to use. feels just right in my hand so I don&#x27;t get carried away and do damage</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Ped Egg for a while now.  I thought this was a really great buy until I received the product.  These ped eggs are actually smaller than the original Ped Egg that I purchased.  They work fine, I just  wished they were bigger.  Probably the perfect size for a woman though.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved ped egg when I first starting using it over 5 years ago.  However, in the last few years it seems like the design of the ped egg as changed.  The newer ped eggs do not seem to work as well as the old ones.  I use to buy a new ped egg after maybe 6 months of use, to replace it with a newer one that would generally work better.  In the last 2 years when I tried to buy a new one, it seemed like the new ones did not work as well.  I have one ped egg that is old but still working well.  I can&#x27;t replace it because the new ones just don&#x27;t seem the same.  However, I do buy replacement emery pads because the effectiveness of those decreases with use.</li>
    <li> I received this 2-pack as expected.  I got them at an excellent price and I like the color.  They work well.</li>
    <li> I am terrible to my feet - spend as much time barefoot around the house as possible.  Needless to say, I build up callouses fast.  The Ped Egg Platinum is the best product I have ever used for removing callouses!  Much more effective than regular pumice pads, stones and rough stickers on plastic handles!  And you do it while your feet are DRY instead of standing on one foot in a wet shower!  Took a few minutes to do both feet and they look better than they have in years.  The only thing I have had comparable was a couple $75 pedicures where someone worked on my feet for at least 20 minutes AFTER they had soaked in a tub!  Well worth the money and I plan to buy a couple more to have as backup!  I did find them for less than listed here though.</li>
    <li> This is a good buy, for cost reasons and for effectiveness. I no longer have callused feet and the Ped Egg is easy to use/clean out. I disagree with a lot of the negative comments regarding the refill blades being dull (I have test each blade as recommended on forums). Each blade works fine, though I have a feeling that I won&#x27;t need to replace the blade that often.</li>
    <li> I love the product and it does work.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I agree with some reviews that mentioned the total degradation in the quality of this product. In short, they are useless and do nothing the fist generation of Ped Egg did.</li>
    <li> I had a regular ped egg, and it got lost, so I bought this set so my husband and I could each have one. The top and bottom pieces to the ped egg do not stick together so it constantly falls apart in your hand while you&#x27;re using it. Defeats the purpose of the &amp;#34;catcher&amp;#34; part.</li>
    <li> Works well enough. Not quite like the commercials. Got a better finish from using my pumice stone. File wears out fast.</li>
    <li> These ped eggs are amazing. When you cannot get to the salon or cannot afford it my feet are smooth and summer ready. I am so thankful for this product. They even match my bathroom lol!</li>
    <li> Worked okay but had to get a pumis stone to get smaller areas that are hard to reach with this.</li>
    <li> i originally purchased the item when it first came out and couldn&#x27;t find it.  Glad it was offered in a pack of two!  I leave one in a suitcase and one at home!!!  Don&#x27;t travel without it!!  works great when you can&#x27;t make it get a pedi before you take a trip</li>
    <li> This works good and does the job it was made for.</li>
    <li> easy to use and handy, just what I was expecting. Used it for about a week or two, easy to clean, use it gently as it is easy to overdo it when getting those callouses pared down. and soaking your feet first helps some as well; they work fine. I am pleased.</li>
    <li> Good value for all that&#x27;s included.  Black color might not be the best, however, because it shows the skin dust and filings ...</li>
    <li> I am a little obsessed with having foot care.  This is a great product to have if you care about your feet being smooth and soft, it does the job.</li>
    <li> gets all the dead skin helps prevent calluses. price for these are much better on here than in retail stores</li>
    <li> Great purchase did everythng that I wanted..Can not wait too wear my open toe shoes....ready for summer..great buy..worth waiting for</li>
    <li> It is just the same product as regular pedEgg but with 2 key things thet did the trick for me&lt;br /&gt;You get 2 items right out of the box(no need to order 2 of them since anyone rarily does it untill one gets lost and  you have to wait for second one to arrive)&lt;br /&gt;It is different from the reagular white one&lt;br /&gt;If you have one in the family - without marking it you and everyone else knows which one is yours</li>
    <li> This works great! I gave the extra one to my father and we are both liking it. It&#x27;s something that I very much neeeded.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a waitress, so I&#x27;m constantly on my feet and low on budget for pedicures.  After reading a few reviews, I settled on buying this instead of the regular ped-egg.  Not sure what the difference is, but I can tell you this platinum edition does just what it says!  It was easy to use, although taking it apart was difficult without it flying apart... do it over a trash can.  The buffer is a great to use after filing!  My feet have NEVER been this smooth.  I only wish I&#x27;d bought it sooner!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with these ped eggs - they are additional ones to the single I have had for some time. Thanks,</li>
    <li> I feel like this is a pretty good value considering the number of emory pads you get along with the two Ped Eggs. We use them a few times on week, and so far our feet feel a lot softer. It&#x27;s a good thing to have handy if you get dry feet, and this is as good a deal as any when you&#x27;re looking to buy them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that shortly after purchasing these on Amazon, we saw the same item and a few other cute colorful options of Ped Eggs in a Ross store for about a third of what these cost. It might be worth your time to check somewhere like that before ordering these on Amazon, but either way it is a great product and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Product is great, however use caution not to overuse and injure your feet. Product was shipped timely manner. Thank You! Sometimes I&#x27;m just looking for the file pads that I use 2nd.</li>
    <li> After years of neglect, I have finally started focusing on my feet.  I purchased the Ped Egg Platinum after reading the reviews on here.  LOVE IT.  My feet are so much softer now. I use it and then I put coconut oil on my feet.  I let the oil soak in and then put socks on...my feet have never looked or felt this good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why I thought they ran on batteries....they don&#x27;t.  These are kind of like mini cheese graters.</li>
    <li> This item works so well and makes my feet look so much better! Before they were so caloused to the point that they were white, dry, and disgusting but after using this, always look so much better!</li>
    <li> These must be &amp;#34;seconds&amp;#34; or didn&#x27;t pass quality control because they are duller than the ones I wanted to replace.  Will never buy again.</li>
    <li> These work very well. And are very easy to clean. I&#x27;ll be recommending these to anyone who is looking for a similar product.</li>
