      <li>but my skin..that is what I am looking for good skin reviews</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m as fair skinned as one can be...</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>Thankfully I decided to get this one (opal), perfect for medium to golden tan skin.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the shine that it gives your face!</li>
      <li>I am so in love!</li>
      <li>It works like magic!</li>
      <li>Anyhow, I love it!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s amazing..</li>
      <li>simply amazing</li>
      <li>I mix 1 pump with my tinted moisturizer for a nice glow.</li>
      <li>I picked Opal which blends really nicely with my skin.</li>
      <li>but you don&#x27;t need too much on your face to get a flawless look!</li>
      <li>The color is a warm, champagne nude with the finest shimmers.</li>
      <li>Kind of made me look like I&#x27;d rubbed my face in butter.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!</li>
      <li>Having said that, it is VERY pretty and gives a gorgeous glow, but damn it&#x27;s tricky to work with.</li>
      <li>/matte any gives a more \\&quot;lit within\\</li>
      <li>I definitely want to buy more Becca products as they so great for make up!</li>
      <li>it gives you that healthy glow</li>
      <li>Love that Amazon has it in stock now that Sephora quit carrying it.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m in love with it.  </li>
      <li>The packaging is okay, but my Split two days and having it with no refuse.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this stuff; it mixes with any tinted moisturizer (I use Nars), any CC or BB creme (I like Ole Henrickson, Dermadoctor DD creme, and Miracle Skin Transformer), or any foundation ( I like By Terry, Allison Raffaele, Rouge Bunny Rouge among others) and makes it BETTER.</li>
      <li>Love this product although it is overpriced.</li>
      <li>For a more pronounced contouring highlighting I would go with Moonstone though.</li>
      <li>Outstanding.. love it use and mix with my foundation.</li>
      <li>So glad I found this product</li>
      <li>It makes my skin look so healthy and smooth, without looking like</li>
      <li>I look much more fresh with it.</li>
      <li>I have a light to medium complexion and chose between Opal and Moonstone.</li>
      <li>Much to light</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll last me for a good while.</li>
      <li>I also love that this particular color goes with most skin tones.</li>
      <li>love it in my late 50&#x27;s and am told my skin is beautiful..</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really absorb into this skin, it just kinda sits on top, meaning your foundation will slip from the area its applied after a couple unless you use the TINIEST amount and put powder over it, though even then it might not hold.</li>
      <li>This nice, have a soft texture and make my skin shiny.</li>
      <li>great accent make up for evenings as well as special other times...</li>
      <li>love it, mix it with your regular foundation to add glow :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a big make up girl, but this is simple and effective and because its effective its worth the price  </li>
      <li>Overall, this is a nice product</li>
      <li>Not quite worth the hype.</li>
      <li>and I rarely leave reviews.</li>
      <li>The good thing is that you don&#x27;t need to use the full pump whenever you pump it out, I just use half of that</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, it highlights nicely, and I believe it&#x27;s worth the price if you have dry her skin that isn&#x27;t Dewy.</li>
      <li>and I can honestly say it will find a place in my makeup drawer ( a notoriously fickle place) for a long time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to pump out too much product if you only want to use it sparingly.</li>
      <li>A little bit goes a long ways, it gives you that perfect shine.</li>
      <li>Such a lovely liquid highlighter.</li>
      <li>I was hesitant to get this product at first since i wanted to see first hand the &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34; on the product.</li>
      <li>It blends into my medium skin-tone easily and gives it such a pretty sheen.</li>
      <li>You appear to have a healthy glow, without all the trouble of highlight and contour with powder and special creams, which can be drying.</li>
      <li>I recently bought this product after watching Jessy Decker post it on her YouTube page, and it&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
      <li>It really perks up and finishes your make-up.</li>
      <li>Once it dries it doesn&#x27;t really blend or budge.</li>
      <li>I was so tired of searching for a highlighting foundation that didn&#x27;t make me appear to have glitter on my face (!), and this is perfect in that respect.</li>
      <li>all year round is normal for me but for some it might be more for a fresh summer complexion look.</li>
      <li>The only thing is that it&#x27;s pretty pricey but definitely worth it.  </li>
      <li>I do find that it makes my foundation slightly darker, which is odd but not necessarily a problem because I think it&#x27;s only slight and is perfect for summer months, but since I bought this to add a &amp;#34;photo finish&amp;#34; to my favorite foundation, I think I will also try to the whiter (pearl) version for the winter months ahead.</li>
      <li>I live in Florida so having a non-matte texture on the skin</li>
      <li>When I used this alone it left my face greasy, but when I used it over foundation it worked really well.</li>
      <li>I mix this with my foundation and it offers a dewy, glowing finish all over my face, which was the purpose I bought it for.</li>
      <li>All the professional makeup artists use this brand.</li>
      <li>It makes your skin glow just enough to make it look younger and fresh.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had mine over 6 months and still have a half a container full.</li>
      <li>but, no, it&#x27;s not that subtle or natural and considering the price, there are definitely better options out there.</li>
      <li>Now I do live in Memphis TN and the heat does add an extra dewey look to it</li>
      <li>It adds a warm glow without being fake.  </li>
      <li>This is also pretty moisturizing; it hasn&#x27;t dried or irritated my skin yet.</li>
      <li>But this product came so highly recommended by Lisa Eldridge and other sites.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ok. let me just say that I order from Amazon about 10 times a month and I rarely leave reviews. However, I wanted to give my two cents about this product. I love it!! I do not wear foundation everyday but I wear this product every single day. Now I do live in Memphis TN and the heat does add an extra dewey look to it but it is a great product! I also love that this particular color goes with most skin tones. I am an AAF on the lighter skin side but my cousin is darker and it blends well with her skin to. I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! A little pricey but you don&#x27;t need too much on your face to get a flawless look! So glad I found this product, it&#x27;s everyday go to!</li>
    <li> This nice, have a soft texture and make my skin shiny. Also, have a small matting effect.</li>
    <li> This skin perfector does cover all skin imperfections and feels great when you are wearing it.  The color is perfect to wear alone or under your makeup.  It is a bit shiney when you have just it on.  Love that Amazon has it in stock now that Sephora quit carrying it.</li>
    <li> This is a great highlighter. I only gave it four stars because I prefer the colorization of the Josie Maryn on Argan oil highlighter. The packaging is okay, but my Split two days and having it with no refuse. I would also say that it&#x27;s a little bit more difficult to blend into your foundations then other highlighters I&#x27;ve used particularly because of the thickness of the liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it highlights nicely, and I believe it&#x27;s worth the price if you have dry her skin that isn&#x27;t Dewy.</li>
    <li> When I used this alone it left my face greasy, but when I used it over foundation it worked really well. It makes your skin glow just enough to make it look younger and fresh.</li>
    <li> Amazing! this shimmering perfector changed my look of constantly tired working mum. I look much more fresh with it.</li>
    <li> Poduct generally is very good, it gives your sin that healthy glow,smells nice!Unfortunately,it has parabens and other chemicals in it like i suspected!So i wold not go back for it!</li>
    <li> Saw Lisa Eldridge recommend it. Was looking for something to bring some radiance back to my 40 year old boring un-co operative skin. Have tried powder illuminators before on my cheekbones but this is in another ballpark all together. Works however you choose to use it under foundation, over, sparingly, everywhere etc. if you use it as a highlighter at the end of your make-up application you have to be careful to put it spot on though. Once it dries it doesn&#x27;t really blend or budge. You have to use powder to bring it down. Easiest is putting it before foundation or mixed with it. I live in Florida so having a non-matte texture on the skin all year round is normal for me but for some it might be more for a fresh summer complexion look. Anyhow, I love it! It doesn&#x27;t make me feel or look sweaty or oily but evens my complexion to the point where I hardly need foundation nor concealer at all. It works like magic! I am so in love! I have a light to medium complexion and chose between Opal and Moonstone. I picked Opal which blends really nicely with my skin. For a more pronounced contouring highlighting I would go with Moonstone though.</li>
    <li> This is a very flattering makeup base</li>
    <li> Becca is Becca.....simply amazing</li>
    <li> Lots of people rave about this product ...li don&#x27;t like it ....I prefer my sephora shimmer product for glow. This fails for me....may be useful for lighter skinned people</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really absorb into this skin, it just kinda sits on top, meaning your foundation will slip from the area its applied after a couple unless you use the TINIEST amount and put powder over it, though even then it might not hold. Having said that, it is VERY pretty and gives a gorgeous glow, but damn it&#x27;s tricky to work with.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to get this product at first since i wanted to see first hand the &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34; on the product. I didnt want to get the glittery look on my face. But this product came so highly recommended by Lisa Eldridge and other sites. Also, I was not sure if i should get the pearl (white variation). Thankfully I decided to get this one (opal), perfect for medium to golden tan skin. It does not &amp;#34;glitter&amp;#34; or shimmer in a very weird way on the skin...its just gives the skin that luminosity, like you&#x27;re just radiant from within. I dont know how to describe it but its definitely a keeper.</li>
    <li> Overall, this is a nice product and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. I mix this with my foundation and it offers a dewy, glowing finish all over my face, which was the purpose I bought it for. I don&#x27;t use it for spot highlighting, so I can&#x27;t speak to that. I do find that it makes my foundation slightly darker, which is odd but not necessarily a problem because I think it&#x27;s only slight and is perfect for summer months, but since I bought this to add a &amp;#34;photo finish&amp;#34; to my favorite foundation, I think I will also try to the whiter (pearl) version for the winter months ahead. I was so tired of searching for a highlighting foundation that didn&#x27;t make me appear to have glitter on my face (!), and this is perfect in that respect. It&#x27;s a flattering shimmer, no glitter in sight. This is also pretty moisturizing; it hasn&#x27;t dried or irritated my skin yet. You appear to have a healthy glow, without all the trouble of highlight and contour with powder and special creams, which can be drying.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected ... so I am not using it ....</li>
    <li> Such a lovely liquid highlighter. The color is a warm, champagne nude with the finest shimmers. It blends into my medium skin-tone easily and gives it such a pretty sheen. Oily skinned people may want to set it with a setting spray to keep it lasting longer. I like to use it on the &amp;#34;outer C&amp;#34; of my cheekbones/temple, the bridge of my nose, cupid&#x27;s bow, and inner corners of my eyes. It makes my skin look so healthy and smooth, without looking like I have glitter sitting on my face. It does not break me out either (keep in mind that this is not an oil-free highlighter). The only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; for me is the pump it comes with. It&#x27;s very easy to pump out too much product if you only want to use it sparingly. I can&#x27;t believe I found this on Amazon for less than $30. It typically sells at Sephora/Nordstrom for over $40. Beautiful, beautiful highlighter.</li>
    <li> Love this highlighter!!  Becca has the best highlighter going on now. All the professional makeup artists use this brand. You get tons for your money and it will last forever. I&#x27;ve had mine over 6 months and still have a half a container full.</li>
    <li> I am a woman that buys a ridiculous amount of products every month, plus I receive several subscription beauty sample boxes on a monthly basis as well. At 46 years of age, very few items really get my attention and get me to change my daily routine. I LOVE this stuff; it mixes with any tinted moisturizer (I use Nars), any CC or BB creme (I like Ole Henrickson, Dermadoctor DD creme, and Miracle Skin Transformer), or any foundation ( I like By Terry, Allison Raffaele, Rouge Bunny Rouge among others) and makes it BETTER. For aging skin, it makes every foundation/TM/CC appear less flat/matte any gives a more \\&quot;lit within\\&quot; appearance. Truly a game changer for me. I use it every day and I can honestly say it will find a place in my makeup drawer ( a notoriously fickle place) for a long time.</li>
    <li> Kind of made me look like I&#x27;d rubbed my face in butter. Worked as such too, and now I&#x27;ve broken out like a pizza.</li>
    <li> Good product. Excellent Job.</li>
    <li> Outstanding.. love it use and mix with my foundation. and it&#x27;s amazing.. love it in my late 50&#x27;s and am told my skin is beautiful..not my make up but my skin..that is what I am looking for good skin reviews.. found winner in this one..</li>
    <li> love it, mix it with your regular foundation to add glow :)</li>
    <li> I saw this on Pixiwoo and decided to try it.  I am 47 and wanted to add some radiance to my cheeks without looking too sparkly.  This perfector is perfect.  I mix alittle with my face lotion and add alittle extra to the apples of my cheeks.  It adds a warm glow without being fake.  I&#x27;m not a big make up girl, but this is simple and effective and because its effective its worth the price  I suggest you give it a try.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I just put it on cleansed and moisturized skin. It made my skin look flawless and glowing.  I won&#x27;t even need to wear foundation if I choose not to.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE the shine that it gives your face! It really perks up and finishes your make-up. I learned about it from a segment on the Today show.</li>
    <li> great accent make up for evenings as well as special other times...great product for that not so shiny finish to makeup</li>
    <li> Not quite worth the hype. Yes, it gives you a glow but, no, it&#x27;s not that subtle or natural and considering the price, there are definitely better options out there.</li>
    <li> I just recieved it couple days ago and I&#x27;m in love with it.  It&#x27;s the best highlighter for my skin and it&#x27;s not too shimmery it gives you that healthy glow and it stay on all day long.  The only thing is that it&#x27;s pretty pricey but definitely worth it.  The good thing is that you don&#x27;t need to use the full pump whenever you pump it out, I just use half of that and it&#x27;s just enough and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll last me for a good while.</li>
    <li> Would not purchase again. Much to light and I&#x27;m as fair skinned as one can be... red hair, green eyes.</li>
    <li> Love this product although it is overpriced. I mix 1 pump with my tinted moisturizer for a nice glow. A bottle lasts a long time</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Making my skin color radiant and hides skin imperfections! I definitely want to buy more Becca products as they so great for make up! I took Opal. It adds a bit tanning effect to the skin.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this product after watching Jessy Decker post it on her YouTube page, and it&#x27;s my new favorite. A little bit goes a long ways, it gives you that perfect shine.</li>
