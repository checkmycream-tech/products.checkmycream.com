      <li>Great stuff - really works.</li>
      <li>For more info, look up &amp;#34;potassium alum&amp;#34;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This GVP deodorant product works better than it&#x27;s more famous Stone Deodorant brother, and it lasts longer without splintering at the end of it&#x27;s life.  </li>
      <li>It is a great natural deodorant.  </li>
      <li>Easily eliminates odor all-day.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend the product.</li>
      <li>By day 3 or 4 you will notice that it has kicked in and is working just fine.</li>
      <li>Have been using it for a few weeks now and find that it works great!!</li>
      <li>our health is the most important thing&amp;#34;; apparently they don&#x27;t use their own products, but use some of the profits to buy something healthier - maybe mainstream deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;(While</li>
      <li>No odor, no irritation, one stick lasts YEARS, works great on preventing the BO, easy to apply (just wet first).  </li>
      <li>It probably would work better if I applied it more regularly.</li>
      <li>It works very well, is easy to apply -</li>
      <li>I wanted a all natural produce, It worked so so, It may work better for someone else.</li>
      <li>It is worth it.</li>
      <li>I have had some success with &#x27;Superglue&#x27;, but if&lt;br /&gt;it drops, throw it away.  </li>
      <li>It does not make you feel sticky and even after a hot day, I still smelt shower fresh 😃</li>
      <li>This is my first time using mineral salts.</li>
      <li>While there are some minerals that belong right next to vitamins, there are others that most certainly don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>so many links between aluminum and various health conditions, I&#x27;d avoid this product... for health reasons and also for their advertising practices.</li>
      <li>This really works!  </li>
      <li>This deodorant illuminates the sweat smell, hope its true about all natural ingredients in them.</li>
      <li>On a standard day it holds up fine though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Ammonium Alum is actually Ammonium Aluminium Sulfate and is a form of aluminum (as it&#x27;s real name indicates), although some claim that its molecules are too large to be absorbed by the skin.</li>
      <li>main problem is how the smoothed mineral is attached into the screw lid / handle.  </li>
      <li>CONSIDER THIS IF YOU HAVE HIGH ACTIVITY LEVELS.</li>
      <li>It is a pure natural product and I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have that issue, but it is a bit of different feeling moving from an antiperspirant as I rarely felt sweat under my arms before.</li>
      <li>Incidentally, the main stream deodorants have the same \\&quot;molecule too big to be absorbed through the skin\\&quot; argument regarding Aluminum Zirconium and Cholohydrate.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend to anybody with sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;\\&quot;Potassium alum is a naturally occurring form of aluminum salt.</li>
      <li>if it is &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;, remember that mineral oil is purely natural, lead is a natural mineral, mercury is a mineral found in nature.</li>
      <li>Have used this for 2 years just bought a new one not long ago.  </li>
      <li>For beginners like me, I would recommend not using this on fresh shaven skin because it stings a little.</li>
      <li>I love how this leaves no residue behind.</li>
      <li>You do need to give it a few days, so don&#x27;t give up if you feel it isn&#x27;t working right away.  </li>
      <li>I broke my first one, but it also lasted over a year and a half.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have used other deodorant stones for years in order to avoid aluminum, but then found out that they contained \\&quot;potassium aluminum\\&quot; (some as much as 60%!), just not aluminum chlorohydrate or zirconium (usually 10-18%). Here&#x27;s how one article described the difference:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Potassium alum is a naturally occurring form of aluminum salt. The difference between potassium alum and aluminum chlorohydrate is that potassium alum is a much larger molecule, not thought to be absorbable through human skin.\\&quot;  Article in MNN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are buying deodorants specifically to reduce your possible intake of aluminum, why not eliminate all aluminum?  Incidentally, the main stream deodorants have the same \\&quot;molecule too big to be absorbed through the skin\\&quot; argument regarding Aluminum Zirconium and Cholohydrate.  Why not just eliminate all aluminum no matter what size the molecule?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, enough negativism. This GVP deodorant product works better than it&#x27;s more famous Stone Deodorant brother, and it lasts longer without splintering at the end of it&#x27;s life.  Give it a try and report back if you have the same results.</li>
    <li> The Mineral Salts Deodorant Stone Works just as advertised. I have had no reactions to the mineral salts stone like I have with other deodorants and it controls odor quite well. It appears that the stone will last for a long time.</li>
    <li> I have been using the same Mineral Salts Deodorant Stone from Green Virgin Products for over a year. It works very well, is easy to apply - just wet the stone and rub it under your arms.  Instead of masking odor with scents, this stick prevents odor.  It is a pure natural product and I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using mineral salts. My usual deodorant was a $7 &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; 20% aluminum zirconium trichlorohydrex type but not anymore. As one reviewer stated, for best results apply more than once. For beginners like me, I would recommend not using this on fresh shaven skin because it stings a little. I also recommend to let your pits dry before wearing a long shirt since the stone has to be wet when applied so this may not be for people on-the-go. The only ingredient stated on this is ammonium alum mineral salts. I love how this leaves no residue behind. I have been using this for a month and I don&#x27;t plan to use anything else.</li>
    <li> Best natural deodarant.  Lasts for years!</li>
    <li> This is the best deodorant I have used.  I like it better than the popular Thai Crystal brand that I used to use.  It lasts over a year for me and has no odor to it...and neither do I!  I strongly recommend the product.</li>
    <li> This is a deodorant, not an antiperspirant, so if you tend to sweat through clothes this won&#x27;t help you. I don&#x27;t have that issue, but it is a bit of different feeling moving from an antiperspirant as I rarely felt sweat under my arms before. I wouldn&#x27;t call this long-lasting though. It tends to wear off about mid-way through the day if I&#x27;m doing anything active. On a standard day it holds up fine though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find it misleading to advertise this as not having aluminum and then to receive the package and see that the ingredients list say &amp;#34;ammonium alum mineral salts&amp;#34;. Ammonium Alum is actually Ammonium Aluminium Sulfate and is a form of aluminum (as it&#x27;s real name indicates), although some claim that its molecules are too large to be absorbed by the skin. Regardless of the claims, the misleading product listing is why I&#x27;ve given this 2 stars.</li>
    <li> This really works!  I am saving a ton of money not only on deodorant, but on my clothes as well!  I was so tired of deodorant with aluminum leaving stains on my clothes and ruining them, so I gave this a try and it works!  You do need to give it a few days, so don&#x27;t give up if you feel it isn&#x27;t working right away.  By day 3 or 4 you will notice that it has kicked in and is working just fine.</li>
    <li> No odor, no irritation, one stick lasts YEARS, works great on preventing the BO, easy to apply (just wet first).  I would recommend to anybody with sensitive skin.  Stay away from the chemically loaded formulations, go with this instead.</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant stone! The only thing is you have to be careful not to drop it!</li>
    <li> Love it !! Have been using it for a few weeks now and find that it works great!! It does not make you feel sticky and even after a hot day, I still smelt shower fresh 😃 they should make a smaller one for those who travel or go to the gym. If you perspire a lot, just reapply it&lt;br /&gt;like you would with regular deodorant. I love it !!!!</li>
    <li> I wanted a all natural produce, It worked so so, It may work better for someone else. Try it you may like it.</li>
    <li> Have used this for 2 years just bought a new one not long ago.  It is a great natural deodorant.  I have recommended it to lots of people,  gave it as gifts and everyone loves it.</li>
    <li> not sticky, keeps me from stinky, and no stains on shirt. like it! try one and see. oh yeah it last a LONG time too!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: WORE IT FOR SOME TIME AND MY WIFE SAYS IT WASN&#x27;T KEEPING UP, SO IT WORKED FOR A WHILE. BUT I PICKED UP MY ACTIVITY LEVEL AND SHE SAID IT WASN&#x27;T WORKING AS WELL. CONSIDER THIS IF YOU HAVE HIGH ACTIVITY LEVELS.</li>
    <li> It works - although I found it took some getting used to.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product! Works great! Just be careful. If you drop it, it will shatter. I broke my first one, but it also lasted over a year and a half.</li>
    <li> Thank you. It works well.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I thought it would be healthy (and also because it kills the germs!). However, it says &amp;#34;Ingredients: potassium alum mineral salts&amp;#34;, at the same time as saying &amp;#34;No Toxic Chemicals, No Aluminum, No Carcinogens&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t know if Potassium Alum (another name for Potassium Aluminum Sulfate) is or contains a carcinogen, but it indeed contains aluminum, which is toxic! (That&#x27;s how it kills the germs.) At least two of the big print claims are false!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under the brand name, it says &amp;#34;Because our health is the most important thing&amp;#34;; apparently they don&#x27;t use their own products, but use some of the profits to buy something healthier - maybe mainstream deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;(While mainstream deodorants may contain some toxic chemicals, the human body can get rid of those things, but not aluminum. Aluminum builds up over the years, and causes a lot of diseases - especially for women. For more info, look up &amp;#34;potassium alum&amp;#34;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if it is &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;, remember that mineral oil is purely natural, lead is a natural mineral, mercury is a mineral found in nature. While there are some minerals that belong right next to vitamins, there are others that most certainly don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This deodorant illuminates the sweat smell, hope its true about all natural ingredients in them.You have to repeat applying it several times a day for the best effect.</li>
    <li> Label states \\&quot;No aluminum\\&quot; and the only ingredient listed is potassium alum (potassium ALUMINUM sulfate).  I&#x27;m amazed that this product advertises the way it does and gets away with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With so many links between aluminum and various health conditions, I&#x27;d avoid this product... for health reasons and also for their advertising practices.</li>
    <li> The best-working deodorant I have ever used. Easily eliminates odor all-day. Does not stain clothes. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Great stuff - really works. No more chemicals for me.</li>
    <li> I like this and i think it works, though sometimes my girlfriend disagrees.  It probably would work better if I applied it more regularly.</li>
    <li> This product is effective.  I apply it to a larger underarm area than I used to smear antiperspirant, but it is great.&lt;br /&gt;The main problem is how the smoothed mineral is attached into the screw lid / handle.  It becomes looser after&lt;br /&gt;several weeks of &#x27;wetting&#x27; it to apply, and eventually drops out.  I have had some success with &#x27;Superglue&#x27;, but if&lt;br /&gt;it drops, throw it away.  The sharp salt crystals will be too painful to rub on your underarms.  I just purchase&lt;br /&gt;another one.  It is worth it.</li>
    <li> Works like I thought it would.</li>
