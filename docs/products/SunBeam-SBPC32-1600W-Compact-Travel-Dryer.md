      <li>She can hold it easy and it is small enough to take anywhere.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Purchased this for my last trip to Seattle.  Perfect, small, fits in suitcase and makeup bag.  Great for a guest bath too.</li>
    <li> This product was listed as compact, but it is definitely too large to be considered a \\&quot;Compact Travel Dryer\\&quot;</li>
    <li> For a very small travel hair dryer, it has a lot of power. Works for me...</li>
    <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the Travel Dryer is the plug.  I must carry an adapter because it is too big to fit into some sockets.  I have been licky though, because the hotel had another I could use.[[ASIN:B000PY1726 SunBeam SBPC32 1600W Compact Travel Dryer]]</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light weight &amp; has plenty of power! The price was great &amp; it came straight to my home.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 77 year old mother. She can hold it easy and it is small enough to take anywhere.</li>
    <li> I needed a travel dryer, and wanted the smallest one I could find.  Since I was buying on-line and couldn&#x27;t see or try one out, I bought two dryers off Amazon, this one, and the Andis 33805 Micro Turbo, so I could compare.  Both of them turned out to be great small dryers, and when on High, have move heat and airflow than some full size dryers I have used.  However, the Andis is smaller, even though it does not fold, and is the one that I prefer of the two.  But, either one is a great little dryer and I would recommend them both.</li>
    <li> This item was returned for credit.  It seemed poorly constructed.  The voltage power switch did not work properly and and seemed quite loose.  I was not comfortable taking it on a recent trip to Ireland.  As a side note ... every hotel and B&amp;B during the 10 day trip provided a hair dryer in the room.</li>
    <li> This was a good product for the price.  I use it daily and am pleased with this dryer.  (But I don&#x27;t think that Amazon should require a minimum number of words for reviews.)</li>
    <li> I had this hair dryer for two years.  As a guy who use it everyday (2-3 minutes each time) it works very well.  No accessory comes with that such as hopper :)</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful hair dryer.  I use it all of the time, whether I&#x27;m traveling or not.  It&#x27;s incredibly easy to use, and the volume of air is perfect.  In fact, it&#x27;s my main styling tool.</li>
    <li> Handy hook to hang hair dryer.  Folding allows it to travel easily.  Drys hair quickly.  I needed a hair dryer to dry my hair quickly in cold weather.  This one fits the bill and is very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> small, lightweight and powerful.  great product.  when using 220v, there is a safety switch so it will only operate in \\&quot;low\\&quot; speed. this is the equivalent of \\&quot;high\\&quot; speed in 110v so i understand all the horror stories of people frying their hair when they use the \\&quot;high\\&quot; settings on their dryers/straighteners in europe.</li>
    <li> I wanted a good, basic travel hair drier that included a loop to hang it.  This fit the bill and was cheaper than any local alternatives.  I spent many hours searching local stores for one.  Should have just gone online first and saved the trouble.  Produces plenty of hot air and hasn&#x27;t given me any problems.  Can&#x27;t ask for anything more for the price!</li>
    <li> I wanted a small hairdryer to fit easily in a drawer. This is a nice compact dryer and is sturdy. There are two speed settings; low and high. High blows harder than low. I prefer to blowdry my hair on a lower velocity setting so I can style as I dry. The problem with this machine is that the low setting doesn&#x27;t put out any heat. It just blows air. I still want to dry my hair, just not at a high wind velocity. I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> THIS DRYER IS LIGHTWEIGHT AND EASY TO HANDLE. I WENT TO THE HOSPITAL FOR SURGERY, IT WAS PERFECT.  I HAVE ARTHRITIS IN MY HANDS AND IT IS EASY TO HOLD.</li>
    <li> I bought this about 2 or 3 years ago. I needed a small dryer. It is perfect. It has good air flow, even heat, and the fan is not too noisy. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This seemed like a fine little blow dryer until it started shooting sparks a couple of weeks ago. I had no complaints about this dryer, it did its job and was easy to pop into a suitcase or backpack for travel. Would have easily given it four or even five stars. There&#x27;s really no excuse for a such poor quality appliance, even an inexpensive product should last at least one year. I bought it in April 2010. I won&#x27;t purchase another Sunbeam hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I tend to review product after I buy it for a long period to report reliability. I have been owning this item for over one year and I am very pleased with it. It is compact and heats up reasonably fast. It may over heat a little so you do not want to keep it too close to whatever you want to heat for a very long time. I guess you need a little time to \\&quot;customize\\&quot; the way to use it. I guess it is a trade off between convenience and price so I have no complains about it. I&#x27;m happy with what I have paid for.  Just one small suggestion: it can be of great help if there is a option to provide blow with room temperature air, which can make it much more useful. But I hope it will not increase the cost too much, though.</li>
    <li> Small, lightweight, folds well for packing, dual voltage makes it practical for travel.  You can&#x27;t really go back and forth on the voltage setting a lot, so just set it for Europe and leave it that way.  Not terribly strong, but it&#x27;s tiny so just be patient.</li>
    <li> This was a fine hair dryer. I really enjoyed having it. It was easy to pack for trips and worked well at home. But it had a life shorter than I had expected. I realize we&#x27;re in a throw-away world, but this little guy gave up life after just over three years. Too bad.</li>
