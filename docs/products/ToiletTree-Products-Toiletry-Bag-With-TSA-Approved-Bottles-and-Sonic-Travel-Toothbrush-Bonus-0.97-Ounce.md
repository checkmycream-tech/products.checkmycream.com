<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This bag is a water resistant leather material and was much bigger than I realized. The electric tooth brush is great along with the 3 plastic bottles that come along with it. Fits nicely into my luggage bag. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> its not as i though it would be. bigger than expected</li>
    <li> Nice size but the strap that holds the zipper broke two days after receiving it.</li>
    <li> Product was just what I thought.  Fine product for the price.  Delivery was less than 24 hours.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my son to take to camp and it was perfect.  It arrived in two days using my free Prime shipping.  It looks exactly how I expected - nice quality.  I love that the bottles are labeled shampoo, conditioner, and body wash.  The blue circle expands into a cup which is very handy.  The top section had plenty of space for a washcloth, sunscreen, toothpaste, and bug spray with room to spare.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with my ToiletTree toiletry bag. It is very strong and durable, plus it has lots of room for holding my razors, soap, toothbrushes, and other necessities. The TSA-approved travel containers are nice, and already labeled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy sample-size shampoos to take on trips, but now I can just pour some of my normal shampoo, conditioner, and body-wash into the containers and I am good to go. It is nice having container&#x27;s that are made specifically for my bag, and I like knowing that nothing in my bag will result in problems or scrutiny from the Transportation Security Administration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bag is the perfect size for traveling and it holds pretty much everything I need as far as toiletries and medicines. I recommend this bag to anyone, especially since it ships free! It is a great value and of course would make a wonderful Father&#x27;s Day Gift for some deserving Dad.</li>
    <li> My family are huge fans of ToiletTree Products. They are always made with amazing quality and have been very useful products in our household. I&#x27;m excited to share with you their new Toiletry Bag with Travel Accessories.&lt;br /&gt;The black bag has two different zipper large compartments. The top compartment has a double zipper opening making it easier to access and place your travel items in. The other compartment is on the bottom. It contains 3 bottles to hold your shampoo, conditioner and body wash in. Plus a tooth brush holder and a collapsible cup to use for brushing your teeth or getting a quick drink from(part of the lid comes off to hold pills, like pain relieves or vitamins). The bottom compartment also has a zippered mesh section for even more organization, maybe your toothpaste or a small comb.&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say I can&#x27;t wait to fully use this for my summer travels, from using this at home, I&#x27;m loving it and I know it&#x27;s going to be really handy to use for our vacation.&lt;br /&gt;As with ALL ToiletTree Products, I would totally recommend the Toiletry Bag with Travel Accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------&lt;br /&gt;* Disclaimer / Disclosure: I received a free sample to facilitate my review. This post reflects my honest, personal opinion and experience with the product which may differ from yours. Product information courtesy of the sponsor.

    <li> Most awesome toiletry bag I have bought for the price.  Fits all my stuff and comes with a bunch of cool addons.  The cup is pretty sweet.</li>
    <li> Very nice toiletry bag.  Large enough to hold needed supplies with room for several medication bottles for those that need them.  The double zipper on top opens the bag up so you can see and access the contents then quickly closes with the pull that activates both zippers simultaneously.Then bag is ready to go securely by grabbing the zipper pull and handy handle on the end.  Nice!</li>
    <li> Good size, reasonable quality</li>
    <li> Great cosmetic bag w zippered department on bottom holds tree bottles of shampoo, conditioner and moisterizer.</li>
    <li> All around a great product. I love it and am happy to travel with it. The bottom half is perfect for your shampoo and everything.</li>
    <li> Excellent exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> Not what I expected for the price!  I am tempted to return it.  Poor quality :(</li>
    <li> Great bag! I finally have room for every thing!</li>
    <li> Zippers are the drawback</li>
    <li> I have traveled a lot over the past few months and it&#x27;s always a pain having to find small containers to carry my shampoo and soaps in. Now I have a bag that I can carry everything in and I don&#x27;t have to worry about having the right size containers. This is a great quality bag and large enough to carry your make-up or medicines in.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect travel bag! I love that it even comes with TSA approved containers for shampoo and conditioner.  It&#x27;s compact and holds all my bathroom necessities.  Great quality too!</li>
    <li> This was a really nice bag.</li>
    <li> The bag has good quality zippers that move smoothly and will likely last for a long time. The leather is a bit cheaper then i was expecting and feels like it might be vinyl coated. Does look great just not sure how it will stand up to being crammed in a bag for years to come. For the price i would gladly recommend this to others unless they are expecting high quality leather.</li>
    <li> Good product - good price. Came with a couple of refillable bottles in the bottom compartment that I wasn&#x27;t expecting. Big enough for everything a man would need to bring with him while traveling. Not sure about women because they are insane but its pretty big. Feels like it will hold up but only time will tell. I&#x27;d recommend this for anyone who was looking for a good bathroom bag in the $20 price range.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t travel a whole lot but this toiletry bag has been useful when I go camping on weekends.  I use the top compartment to store my makeup and the bottom compartment holds the travel accessories that I use when I take a shower at the shower house.  Rather than having to take full-size bottles of shampoo, conditioner and body wash to the shower house with me, I just put small amounts of each into the marked bottles and take them with me.  The toothbrush holder and compact cup are also nice to have.  My load has been eased by taking this toiletry bag with me to the shower house.  When I&#x27;m not using the travel accessories, they are strapped in place by elastic, ensuring they are secure.  The top compartment is roomy enough that it holds all of my needed makeup.  There&#x27;s a mesh zippered pocked in the bottom compartment and that&#x27;s where I store my hair pieces.  I&#x27;m travelling next weekend and staying in a hotel.  This toiletry bag will definitely be going with me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclosure: I received product for review.  The opinions are of my own.*</li>
    <li> I got the chance to review this toilet tree product and I have to say that it is a great bag to help keep your toiletry products organized. If you are a flyer I could see how this would be especially beneficial. However, for anyone who travels, this is a great way to keep your bathroom products organized for those of us who are not prone to be super organized :). This is great for short trips so you can take your favorite products with you. For someone who has sensitive skin and who is particular about hair products, it&#x27;s nice to be able to take the products that I normally use in travel size bottles instead of having to find room for the full size product. Relying on hotel products are a risk too because you never know what you will get. I recommend this product for anyone who wants to stay organized when they travel. Who doesn&#x27;t need that?</li>
    <li> I returned the product as I was not satisfied with the stitching nor the vinyl pull tab which held the 2 zipper pulls together. It appeared the stitching had no final QC to remove loose ends and excess thread where the stitches terminated.</li>
    <li> I bought this bag for myself and my wedding groomsmen and I&#x27;m very pleased with it. It has a lot of room for storage on both sides of the bag and includes plastic storage bottles etc as shown. I would purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t travel too much but when I do I like to have things ready.  A good toiletry bag is a must since I don&#x27;t want my stuff falling out or apart while away from home.  I also want things organized since I live out of my bags while traveling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ToiletTree Toiletry Bag is great because it contains a great assortment of products to keep my toiletries organized and in convenient travel sizes.  The bag is black, heavy duty and easily cleaned too which is a must!  It features a toothbrush holder and three small bottles approved by the TSA.  It is perfect for your shampoo, conditioner, and body wash - so no more bringing regular-sized bottles or buying all those travel-size bottles.  The collapsible cup with pill holder is something I never thought of but it is a great idea.  No more using cups from hotels or worse having them not having cups in the room.  I take a daily pill so having a collapsible cup is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love the size and durability of the ToiletTree Toiletry Bag.  It fits everything I need and it is built to last.  It would be a perfect gift too for the traveler in your life!  Even if you are not a traveler this is a great makeup bag!  ToiletTree is a brand I have good luck with in the past and so far so good!</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with this bag!  It is a good size and it really holds more than I thought it would.  The included travel sized containers are perfect, both for the gym and for flights.  This bag will get much use!</li>
    <li> Great bag larger than my old dopp bag. Well worth it and can fit everything</li>
    <li> Terrible product.  The bag is multi-purpose and has great storage space.  The handle broke within weeks.  Don&#x27;t waste your time</li>
    <li> I looked at a dozen or so bags before ordering this toiletry kit for my boyfriend.  I liked its size (neither too big or too small). I didn&#x27;t want too many individual compartments, because I knew that my boyfriend would have little patience with  putting everything in the kit in a particular spot.  Having just a few individual holders in the bottom compartment is perfect. The accessories (bottles, etc) are particularly useful. The toiletry bag came quickly as promised.</li>
    <li> The product was a gift for our son.  Though he has not used it yet, he is very pleased with the quality and the product as a whole.  I had a very positive experience with customer service and very pleased with this transaction - thank you!</li>
    <li> I gave this bag to my son as a Christmas gift.  He really liked the separate compartments for soap, shampoo, etc.  Great bag for the price.</li>
    <li> Totally Satisfied.Very well constructed bag.</li>
    <li> I loved this at first.  Ordered one for myself and one for my husband.  For the price, i expected a high quality item.  However, after not much use, the threads are coming apart and soon it will not work.  I have never filled this to capacity and i&#x27;m very surprised it is coming apart.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my picky son and he uses it all of the time.</li>
    <li> As a past repeat traveler, I know how it is to travel and how important it is to have your products arrive safely with you.  With the requirements from the TSA when boarding planes, this makes it a bit more tedious when packing.  I found with the ToiletTree Products Toiletry Bag with Travel Accessories, it makes packing and traveling much easier.  The two separate compartments are ideal just in case there was damage and one of the TSA approved bottles leaked, the rest of the items wouldn&#x27;t be contaminated with the spilled or leaked product(s).  Each side is also not too deep thus making locating the items easier as some times, when traveling, space is limited and you don&#x27;t have the luxury of being able to take the products out to find them.  It&#x27;s made of a water resistant inner liner to keep your items dry and both the inside and exterior are easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s the perfect traveling bag whether for a man or woman. I think having the TSA approved bottles will definitely ensure a smoother transition through security since the bottles are the approved size.  Having everything in one area and secure will simplify use as well.  The toothbrush holder and pop up cup also enables an ease when brushing your teeth.  Given the convenience of use, the protection against spills or leakage and the ability to clean both the interior and exterior with ease, reinforces the worth of the Toiletry Bag with Travel Accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0081JG2T0 ToiletTree Products Toiletry Bag with Travel Accessories (TSA Approved Bottles)]]</li>
    <li> I zipper part on the bag has already broke.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day.  He travels often and needed a new one.  This bag is so nice and well put together.  It has plenty of space inside for everything he carries and the added travel bottles are perfect.  I jut know it&#x27;s going to last him for a good period of time.</li>
    <li> Finally got to use my new kit this week. It&#x27;s a great size! I love the bottom storage which leave a lot of room up top for my glasses case, deodorant, etc. I used the included electric toothbrush which worked fine. The toothbrush has a very small head on it, so it seemed to take me longer to brush my teeth but at least it worked!&lt;br /&gt;This was set at a great price point, and worth every penny!</li>
    <li> My husband recently traveled over to Europe with this bag. I love the TSA approved bottles that are included as it makes traveling through security a no brainer and not only that, it saves so much room in your suitcase when you don&#x27;t have to bring big huge shampoo bottles along. The quality is great and I&#x27;m happy that we received this for review. This bag has become an essential anytime we travel now.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a Christmas present for my husband.  He likes it a lot and is perfect for traveling.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for a reasonable price.  Exactly as advertised.  Very happy I purchased it and very helpful for my vacation.</li>
    <li> Quite satisfied with this toiletry bag - nice quality material and I really like the separate lower compartment for liquids and toothbrush case.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this as a gift, but once I saw the packaging and the material, I decided it looked rather cheap so I didn&#x27;t give it as a gift. But, it is roomy and useful so I kept if for myself to use for overnight trips.</li>
    <li> Exactly the item my adult son wanted; material, craftsmanship, TSA approved bottles, all were exactly as described..definitely worth the price...</li>
    <li> I would say that this travel bag is way better than my last one. The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the two zippers, which was connected by a piece of leather has some how come loose and now I have to unzip each side one by one. It&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me, but some people might get mad at the fact that small things like that breaks on the third use.&lt;br /&gt;-Eddie</li>
    <li> All in all it is a pretty good bag. There is one major defect that I would like remedied . The pull strap on the zipper is already broken on one side. I have only used it once !!! I would have given it a high rating otherwise. I think it only fair to hold my review until I am contacted and instructed on what recource I have .</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for a friend who is very particular about what he wants and he just loved this.  It is exactly what he wanted.  He didn&#x27;t want one of the regular brown leather &#x27;dopp&#x27; kits as they were too small for his necessities. This one is the perfect size for all his items and still small enough to fit nicely in his luggage.  He wasn&#x27;t sure he would use the travel accessories when I showed him the picture but after getting it and seeing how nice they are he is sure he will use them.  The bag is made very well made and a big hit.</li>
    <li> Good bag. Sturdy with a lot of room. Arrived on time and package is good. would recomend</li>
    <li> Great bag.  Large enough to carry all items.  The bottom compartment is useful for shampoo, liquid soap, etc.  It appears durable and well constructed.  Will fit most standard-sized items (shaving cream, etc.).  Great buy!</li>
    <li> As described with plenty of room.  Nice compartment underneath for quick access to travel items.  A+A+A+A+A+</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband. Love the quality and the style.</li>
    <li> He loves this.  For those times when it is necessary or him to spend the night.  Good quality and a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> So far, I really like it.  The reason it got 4 stars instead of 5 is because the bottom section is rather odd to access.  I do like the labeled and properly-sized bottles for shampoo, conditioner, and whatever the third one is.  The toothbrush holder is also nice.  Just kind of an odd place for them, though.  Good quality, good size, and very nice looking.</li>
    <li> Two different compartments are great for separating your toothbrush from your deodorant /cologne.  Fits a lot of stuff.  Would purchase again.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Just the style that hubby thinks he will like.  Opens wide at the top and easy to access what&#x27;s inside.  The bottom compartment holds small travel bottles, toothbrush, toothpaste, lip balm, etc. easily.  Leaves plenty of room in the upper compartment to hold all the rest ... and still easy to find everything ... not jam-packed (yeah)!</li>
    <li> Mt husband forgot his bag in a hotel room so he got and earlier V-day present from me before his next trip.  He loves it.</li>
    <li> Was expecting a better quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Bought this toiletry bag for my husband for Christmas (Dec 2014), to replace the old, broken zippered one he&#x27;d had for years. He loves how roomy the main compartment is, being able to fit all the normal travel toiletry items plus his electric razor and accessories as well. The lower compartment was a real bonus, especially with the toiletry containers it came with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, it&#x27;s survived a few trips and is holding up nicely.</li>
    <li> Great product arrived as expected!</li>
    <li> The groomsmen will love these!</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I travel by plane frequently and has always found it difficult to keep all of my toiletries together. This bag has plenty of space for Toiletries and the bottom compartment along with the TSA Approved Bottles, definitely made flying a bit more convenient. The only downside, was that I still had to take the bottles out and have them in a plastic bag, but other than that, they met the requirements and made going through security fast and easy. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap toiletry bag!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0081JG2T0 ToiletTree Products Toiletry Bag with Travel Accessories (TSA Approved)]] My toiletry Bag arrived today and I have to say that it is one of the nicest travel bags I have owned. I do a lot of traveling and have a lot of various styles. I love the roominess of the main compartment and the orderly stylish travel sized bottles, toothbrush holder and collapsible cup. I adore having quality matching items at an affordable price and this bag meets all my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can tell that this bag is well made and I would not be afraid to give this to anyone as a gift. It has a sexy, rich look that is, great for a man or a woman.</li>
    <li> This ToiletTree Toiletry Travel bag is awesome!  It is so roomy inside and has an additional zipper compartment with TSA-approved bottles, a toothbrush case, &amp; a collapsible cup.  It is very sturdy, too.  You can tell it&#x27;s high-quality.  I would recommend this travel toiletry bag to anyone!</li>
    <li> Really nice.  Zipper is super smooth, capacity of main pocket is more than sufficient for all my stuff, and the bottom zippered pocket is a nice hiding place for &amp;#34;leaky&amp;#34; items, like soaps, mouthwash, etc.  Looks a lot smaller than it really is.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed by the quality of this product. The 3 plastic bottles provided are not hermetic enough and will very likely leak, the electric tooth brush also provided is a joke and the overall bag is made of a low quality plastic.</li>
    <li> I received this bag at no cost in order to review it.  I was surprised by how thick &amp; sturdy the bag was, and I love how the double zipper allows you full access to the inside of the bag.  The separate area on the bottom allows you to find things without digging, and the mesh pocket is perfect for additional storage.  The includes accessories are an added bonus!</li>
    <li> A really nice large and roomy bag with a unique design.  It was a Christmas gift for my husband and he was delighted with it.  I would highly recommend this as a travel accessory.</li>
    <li> We bought this as a gift for a family member who travels quite frequently.  It is great for any traveling person you may know!</li>
    <li> The product looks unisex.  Also it&#x27;s functional enough for basic use.  The bag quality is decent enough for the price.</li>
    <li> I won this travel bag in a giveaway and quickly gave it to my husband.  He quickly switched everything over and had room for more.  The travel containers are very convenient and airplane approved sizes.  The separate compartments are not only cool, but durable and keep things that could spill/leak, tucked away.  It is well made w/ a durable zipper.  We, I mean he, has had it for over 6 months now and have no concerns on having to replace it any time soon.</li>
    <li> I needed a new Dopp kit and saw the ToiletTree ad that described what I wanted. I ordered the Toiletry Bag and received it promptly.  It is exactly as described and I am well pleased. It is well made, roomy and looks good. Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This toiletry bag has a large capacity with upper and lower levels.  Also capable of withstanding wear and tear.  Fits well into suitcase.  Also includes TSA-safe containers for essential liquids.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to first start off by saying my name is Donovan and I live in Canada. To get something that is real nice is really hard due to the fact that not everything comes into Canada and when it does its usually cheaply made or super expensive, so much so that its not worth buying it. A product like this here would cost twice to three times the price payed here and the quality would be much lower. My review is a lot like many that have done this previously. The bag is black, its got great white stitch lines and its solid as a rock and no this is not another Chevrolet ad.... I&#x27;m just kidding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag is made of really nice leather and is huge on the inside. I picked mine up from the states while my wife and I visited her mother, and i only picked it up there because we were already going there and amazon prime would have it there in two days for free, really couldn&#x27;t beat that. I brought all my supplies with me thinking I wouldn&#x27;t be bringing any more back with me. ( toiletries/ shaving supplies) I have to tell you this product gets five stars. I got this bag and in the main compartment it held all the stuff I brought with me initially and then it also held my new safety razor, 250 razor blade refills (5 blades to a pack), a new jar of after shave, a new tub of shaving cream by Taylor of Old Bond Street and shaving oil with enough room to compress it for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above mentioned the main compartment, there is actually two compartments. The second one comes with a toothbrush holder, large enough to hold new spin brushes that go for like 10 dollars, so pretty much not the super expensive dentist ones, but the still hold large then average toothbrushes. Then it also came with three empty 100ml bottles to store what ever you like however if you are like me there I used them for what they are labeled for, and yes they have little labels on them. Lastly this bag comes with one more little surprise which ranks it pretty high on my nifty scale, it comes with a small disk shaped container, which when the lid is taken off it turns into a handy cup for rinsing ones mouth out. This is going to be my primary travel bag from now on, it is amazing on how great the quality it is for such a small price, and when my bag does finally decide to break down I will be coming back and ordering another, hopefully in a different color. ( would prefer to have brown instead of black)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for making such an amazing product and not cheaping out on cheap zippers, the ones you did use for the bag are smooth, they never kink and they are a nice low noise when opening and closing.</li>
    <li> I had reservations about it not being made of leather, but it is a good product and works great.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an old beatup shaving kit that had served years past its time.&lt;br /&gt;This one is VERY nice and even better than the picture indicates.  I especially like the zippered compartments inside the main part as well as on the bottom.  I don&#x27;t have any use for the supplied travel bottles for shampoo, etc. so I took them out until the next time I have to fly somewhere as they are approved for security checks.  This makes room for cell phone chargers, etc.  The leather is supple and looks great.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great bag with plenty of space. High quality and durable with a convenient carrying handle. I love the lower compartment with shampoo/lotion bottles and space to keep items separate from the main bag. I would recommend this bag!</li>
    <li> Bought this three times.  I travel a lot and perfect size with bottom are to store shampoo bottles.  Great product except the straps break after a few months.</li>
    <li> Too much space taken up by the bottom pouch.  Would have preferred it were all one pocket.  Overall, does well.</li>
    <li> The quality appeared good from photographs on Amazon and the reviews seemed OK.  However, the strap that zips the 2 zippers closed, broken literally the 1st time I pulled it shut.  I did not pull too hard.  It broke from 1 side.  Just to check I pulled on the other side which quickly broke as well.  At least this part of the design (the strap the connects to the zippers) is VERY WEAK.</li>
    <li> I like the size of the bag and the containers that it comes with but the strap between the two zippers on the top portion broke after 5 days of use.  With a simple pull on it the strap snapped in half.  I&#x27;m going to have to run a shoe string or something between the two zippers to keep using it.</li>
    <li> Product arrived very fast, within 2 days of ordering. It is a great quality toiletry bag with plenty of room. The bottom pouch with the plastic bottles and travel toothbrush is also a great addition. The price can&#x27;t be beat for the product you are getting.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something for my husband to replace his current toiletry bag that is falling apart. While he liked the quality and style of this one, it is a little too big for his taste. The size is fine for a piece of checked luggage, but a little bulky for a carry-on. The size is as pictured, but based on reviews of other products, I focused more on the dimensions and think I was off in my calculations.</li>
    <li> I bought it because it has two compartments and because it appeared to be spacious.  It’s OK on both counts.  The one aspect I was uncertain about was the softness or rigidity of walls – I was hoping for the latter, to protect the contents rather than merely to contain it.  However, it’s rather soft;  the walls of my old toiletries bag are rigid and protect the contents well, but it’s also about 1/3 smaller than this new one.  For that reason, I’m keeping it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality appears to be OK, but I wouldn’t even try to guess its durability.</li>
    <li> Ok qulaity for the price. Functioality of good . i just dont think this bag willlast long with almost weekly business travel.</li>
    <li> If your looking for a bag to carry shaving gear while traveling perhaps you should consider this one. The company is great and the delivery was quick. This bag is large enough to put everything needed in it and then easy to retrieve the items.</li>
    <li> This bag is actually bigger than what I expected, a nice surprise when shopping online. I will be using this bag for the first time when I travel to the Philippines in January. Looking forward to being able to fit everything I need in this bag.</li>
    <li> It was bigger than I expected it to be but I&#x27;m very happy with what I got. The package got here early! That was even more great and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. Definitely recommend buying!</li>
    <li> This is a very handy toiletry bag. Its the perfect size and well made. The travel bottles/toothbrush case are a bonus.</li>
    <li> It was delivered in a timely manner.  It is as pictured and should work very well for future travels.  I like the way the zipper opens.  The opening is large enough to making packing easy.</li>
    <li> Good construction and material, design allows maximum space use. The included travel bottles are a nice touch. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Very roomy! With the bottles in the compartment on the bottom, no chance of spillage and that is great.</li>
    <li> This thing has got it all. Ample storage, travel sized bottles, a separate section for perfectly fits this company&#x27;s travel mirror (which I also bought). My husband was pretty pleased with it and has used it regularly and happily for a few years now.</li>
    <li> I bought this toiletry bag and the strap came off after opening and closing it twice. very disappointing....</li>
    <li> This is a very nice bag. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase. It isn&#x27;t as big as some reviewers here claim but it isn&#x27;t too small either. I&#x27;d buy this bag again.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a 20 year old bag that was tearing up, it seems to be working out great , enough room for every thing that I carry, stylish. The only thing i would change is instead of the cup I would make that area fit a soap holder of some type. I looked at more expensive bags and for the money and versatility this was the best value.</li>
    <li> My main traveling toiletry bag. Great space and the bottom pocket with 3 traveling bottles and a toothbrush is a nice addition.</li>
    <li> My son travels between Texas and South Carolina several times a year, not to mention any other flight he takes, and he wanted something light, well built and not too pricey. I found this on Amazon, looked like it fit the bill just right. I found it just that, no need for a high dollar leather kit this is made very well and the bottles are a bonus too!</li>
    <li> I purchased 3 of these bags for Christmas presents for the 3 men in my life (husband, son &amp; son-in-law).  My husband&#x27;s past toiletry bags have always been too small for all the things he requires for travel.  Upon opening these toiletry bags at Christmas all 3 of my men were very pleased with the roominess of the bag, the plastic bottles and folding cup included with the bag and the quality of workmanship. I made a hit with this item with all 3 men. I would recommend this to anybody who travels for pleasure or business. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> The bag is roomy and stands up on its own.  It is attractive.  Time will tell if it holds up with use.</li>
    <li> Sorry to have to return this because it&#x27;s very well made and looks good. But my husband says it&#x27;s too big for his needs.</li>
    <li> The bag itself is what I was looking for, however, the strap that controls the double zipper came apart.  One brad was gone, so opening the top of the bag is going to be inconvenient.  This was a Christmas gift and the recipient only removed from the box this week for use.</li>
    <li> Great bag, lots of room in top compartment and the bottom is easily accessible and functions well as designed, quick access to those frequently used items,  high quality bag.  Plenty of room.</li>
    <li> Looove this thing.  Fits all of my toiletries perfectly.  The bag is awesome zips around the bottom and holds 3 bottles good for shampoo conditioner mouthwash body wash, etc and has a tuthbrush tube.  Then there is a mesh spot for a small tube of toothpaste and I keep my tongue scraper in there.  Also has a telescoping cup for rinsing, mouthwash or whatever.  Top has plenty of room for shaving cream, soap, body wash, cologne, deodorant, etc.  the way it opens up top is pretty clever too, two zippers running down the side connected by a leather strap so you grab the tab at the end that has velcro and rip it off and pull up and the zippers roll back automatically then when you are done grab the leather strap and zip the two zippers closed which will automatically close the flap and the velcro just kinda catches by itself.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely bag and was delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> Good product, well designed and fair priced.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price. I like the extra compartment on the bottom for the small bottles that it comes with. Perfect for travel.</li>
    <li> This product is just ok, but not the stylish toiletry bag I was looking for for my husband.  I will keep for vacations when my kids overtake my own bag.  Now they have their own.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband who is a Flight Attendant. He travels quite frequently as you might expect, so he needs a toiletry bag that is durable and will hold all the essentials while also adhering to the guidelines of the TSA. This travel bag covered ALL those bases and even has the 3 oz bottles included for easy transport of the correct measurements for airline travel. It&#x27;s the perfect size for his carry on luggage as well as a full size bag if we are traveling non work related. The bottom compartment is for items such as toothbrush, shampoos, razors etc… and the top is very roomy for other items he finds necessary. He LOVES everything about this bag and would highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates an upscale bag at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> This product is good quality materials and convenient in that it includes TSA approved bottle sizes for shampoo, etc.  I gave it only 3 stars because of the large size.  I would be very pleased with the top portion being half the size because once the shampoo, etc bottles are used there are only a few more items needed in the bag, i.e. razor, comb, brush, toothpaste, etc.</li>
    <li> the bag arrived on time and in a good condition.it was a perfect size for carry on and it had plenty of room.</li>
    <li> I needed a new toiletry kit as the one I had was pretty much shot. This bag was perfect for me because of the size. Most bags are around 3 inches high so if you need to pack some larger items, it takes up most of the room. With the ToiletTree kit, the height is a good 6 inches which allows for plenty of space. The zippered compartment below containing 3 plastic bottles, a toothbrush holder and collapsible cup was perfect. For the price, this was just perfect!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my boyfriend to use on a 7 day trip.  He loved it, especially the bottom compartment with the travel sized containers.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was the material looks cheap however it is pretty sturdy and seems like it could survive a pretty decent beating from constant travel which is more important than looks.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet. It is a great size for carrying all toiletries. The compartment for the liquids is very nice - contains a toothbrush holder, 3 tsa compliant bottles, and a collapsible cup. I can&#x27;t imagine filling the main compartment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem is that it may be a little too big.</li>
    <li> When I opened my ToiletTree bag and filled up the included bottles, I could not shut up telling my wife how happy I was that I had this thing. I&#x27;ve never had a cool travel toiletry bag since I got one in my welcome pack at college eight years ago. Getting this bag makes me feel like I&#x27;ve made it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a guy with many hair products, shaving items, and more bottles than most guys would ever use, the bag has plenty of space in the up top storage. The below storage - designed for a toothbrush and three bottles of your choice - is well designed and spacious for your bathroom goodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, it makes me feel cool when I&#x27;m traveling and aren&#x27;t stuffing all my crap in a gallon size ziploc bag like I&#x27;m 14 and going to camp.</li>
    <li> This bag seems to be made much better than my old travel kit that finally wore out after 20 years of use.  If it lasts half as long, I&#x27;ll be satisfied.</li>
    <li> Purchased to replace one I had for 15 years when the zipper broke . This one is much larger looks very nice has a double zipper closer as well as a bottom compartment for TSA shampoo bottles included .the bag looks well made and should last many years .</li>
    <li> Great size for everything needed, especially shaving gear.  Nice zippered underside pouch with bottles and convenient folding cup. Zipper action on topside is excellent.</li>
    <li> First, I&#x27;m impressed and surprised how much capacity I have to hold my things besides the bottom half that holds the bottles and the cool sonic care like brush.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to open and use. Good quality all around.</li>
    <li> The Toiletry Bag with Travel Accessories is without a doubt the best kit I have ever owned. It has plenty of space to put all of my bathroom products. I especially like the bottom compartment which contains TSA approved bottles for shampoo, conditioner, mouthwash, etc.&lt;br /&gt;The people at ToiletTree are excellent to work with. They are easy to get in touch with and are quick to answer your questions and take care of any needs regarding their products.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product and this company to anyone. In the future I will not hesitate to order from ToiletTree.&lt;br /&gt;George Prewett</li>
    <li> Well made!  It can hold a lot of items that you will need.  I like that it came with small travel bottles and it is in a separate compartment.  Size is perfect!  Price is reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually bought another one for my son.  So, Yes, highly recommendable!</li>
    <li> This product is perfect. Its a little big for my husband but for myself with my makeup and soaps its perfect. I love this bag. I travel globally and it is a perfect fit with my Samsonite hardshell 28\\&quot; suite case.</li>
    <li> The great thing about this is that it is really spacious when you need to to be but it can also squish down pretty flat when it&#x27;s empty or only partly full. It also comes with shampoo containers and a pill holder/collapsable water cup. I would recommend this to anyone who travels for periods of a few days to a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Great Shaving Kit. Large enough to carry all my items</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with the 3 bottles and toothbrush case it comes with. I think it will last many many a trips.</li>
    <li> great for travelling. comes with tsa approved bottles.</li>
    <li> Great case, a bit bigger than I was expecting but it turns out it was a good thing to have a bigger case, I now can put all my small items in the toiletry bag rather than constantly looking for them lost in my luggage. Very durable as well, and easy to open and close and stays closed.</li>
    <li> The toiletry bag is really very nice.  I had tired for years to get the husband to change out of a really cheap plastic one but he would not change.  When he saw this one he could not wait to move his items over.  He loved the storage compartment with the bottles and the collapsing cup is great for taking his medications.  With the storage compartment he has more room than most bags have.  The construction is very good and should last for several years.  So glad to see the old one go.</li>
    <li> The product is so good, it fits a lot of things and it looks good as well</li>
    <li> Here is a great holiday gift for that traveler in your life! This Toiletry Bag from ToiletTree Products has loads of room inside for all those necessities that have to go with a traveler on a trip. There are two sections for storing all your goodies like makeup, razors, hair clips, deodorant, and more. Honestly, it&#x27;s big enough I could probably put a pair of shoes in it too. The top zips open with a double-sided strap zipper with a velcro closure tab, plus it has a carry handle on one end. The bottom section zips open to reveal even more storage. There is a zippered section made of mesh, plus loops that hold the included TSA approved accessories for a toothbrush, shampoo, conditioner and body wash. There is even a pop-up plastic water cup included where you can store your pills too. It&#x27;s incredibly well-designed with the traveler in mind! I love this Toiletry Bag and will be using it over and over when we travel. Disclosure: I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> This travel bag came exactly as described.  Good size, and nice bottle design.  Only downfall I can see it that the bottles do not have capacity listed on them, so im not sure how these fare with the airlines security check. In my past experience, they always want to see the volume/capacity listed on the bottles, and its not listed or printed on any of my bottles.  I guess I will find out soon enough.  I would be curious to hear from anyone who has used them if they had any issues because of this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise great bargain, and nice bag.</li>
    <li> So...Five stars just for the brand name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Plenty big without being too big, sturdy, access is good.  To me it&#x27;s the perfect size for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Yes, the bottles are TSA approved for size (3 oz), but you&#x27;ll have to take them out of the elastic holders and put them in the clear zipper bag (not provided) to be able to bring them on a plane with you.  With the bottles out of the elastic holders, the cup seemed more likely to fall out of its holder.</li>
    <li> Nice shaving kit.  Useful, functional, good materials. Added bonus: Small bottles for shampoos and other liquids. Great service. Will buy again from this company</li>
    <li> Really good product, sweet bag that have couple of bottles inside which is convenient for people who love traveling!  They also have good customer service that really consider customer&#x27;s needs! I really recommend products by ToiletTree!</li>
    <li> I have just completed by first trip with this bag and it went well.  There isn&#x27;t a whole you can say about a toiletry bag.  It is nice to have a separate compartment for liquids.  The bulk section is plenty big for me to bring enough for 2 weeks out of country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest plus to me; my last bag failed because the zipper fell apart, and the plastic divider between the liquid and dry side failed.  I see this bag being better in both regards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why it lost a star; It&#x27;s a nice product but not perfect.  The leather isn&#x27;t the best and the way the bottles are secured into the liquid side somewhat limits how you can pack it and get other stuff in.</li>
    <li> This travel toiletry bag is spacious and appears to be made of quality materials.  The bottles are the perfect size and accepted by the TSA.</li>
    <li> Kinda wish the leather was tougher.</li>
    <li> I was a huge fan of this bag when I first got it, and I really still am. The top section is perfect for any big bottles that might leak and things that can get wet, and the bottom section is perfect for things that should be stored dry like razors and tooth brushes. To top off a perfectly sized bag, it comes with travel bottles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I can drum up is that the strap between the two top zippers broke about a month after I got it, but the zippers still work.</li>
    <li> This bag is great.  Its a very good size that will hold all my husbands toiletries on our vacation and the bottom compartment is wonderful</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  I travel often and I&#x27;m constantly looking for the best luggage and other types of travel bags.  I won&#x27;t need to look for a toiletry bag anytime soon.</li>
    <li> The bag was a lot smaller than I originally thought it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price of the bag no doubt most of it goes towards the included electronic toothbrush and three small bottles that can be found in the bottom portion. I think the included items are really extra and shouldn&#x27;t be included, you can buy a much better toothbrush elsewhere for less and the bottles are a good idea but unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag space itself in the top portion is not much, I can&#x27;t fit a majority of my items in there. I&#x27;m in the US Navy and when on the ship in berthing I need to be able to take my shower stuff in addition to shaving, tooth care, and deodorants to the head from my rack. This bag is too small for that. The quality of the bag is great, however the zippers on top broke after a couple uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that the zipper is broken I have to take extra care to make sure stuff doesn&#x27;t fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t recommend the purchase of this item.</li>
    <li> This travel toilet kit was exactly as advertised, and I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I like the size and layout of the bag, but the stitching around the zipper came loose on my first trip so I don&#x27;t think I can recommend this product based on it&#x27;s current level of quality.</li>
    <li> Good size and quality material. You can fit a lot of toiletries in this bag!! I would definitely recommend this product for traveling.</li>
    <li> Love this bag, I&#x27;m a guy and it fits all my shaving cream, face wash, toothbrush, electric shaver and really anything else. The bottom zipper is nice to have and is great for organizing. I bring it everywhere.</li>
    <li> Just a good quality bag for a reasonable price.  The zippers seem like good quality and it really helps me keep my stuff organized.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This bag is perfect. Although there was a small issue with the order ToiletTree customers service was great. I have ordered other products from this company, and so far so good.</li>
    <li> Nice quality, Holds travel products very nicely.</li>
    <li> exactly what I wanted the cloth between the large compartment and the lower area tore but I am ok with that because I wanted the larger area. I travel a lot and with this bag I can pack the regular size toiletries.</li>
    <li> We received our bag just in time for our upcoming trip. I love the way it opens at the bottom and comes with approved travel bottles, collapsible cup with pill holder, and toothbrush case. The 3 bottles are individually marked as Shampoo, Conditioner and Body Wash. With their items in one of these containers it&#x27;s simple for him to locate everything immediately when needed. There is nothing more frustrating than having to search through your whole bag looking for your toothbrush! The inside compartment of the bag is rather large to fit cologne, a razor, shaving cream etc.</li>
    <li> larger than I thought, very useful.</li>
    <li> i like the style of this case for travel. it is not leather but is still fairly well made. like the compartments. quick delivery</li>
    <li> Great bag which I&#x27;ve used on two long trips thus far. It holds everything I need and then some! I like how it came with bottles, a collapsable cup, and a toothbrush holder. The bag is high quality and waterproof.</li>
    <li> Just as it looked online. Perfect for my husbands needs.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s bigger than I thoughts.  Takes up a lot of room if you are only using it with an overnight bag.</li>
    <li> I was given my toiletry bag as a gift. The bag I used previously I had for about five years and I was happy with it. I gave the new one a try and believe me it&#x27;s hard for me to change my habits. I&#x27;m thrilled with this product. I&#x27;m retired and go on vacations regularly. This bag zips open so easily and with the different compartments helps organize my hygiene supplies rather than my previous bag where everything was all mixed together. Thanks Toilettree for a great product.</li>
    <li> My family and I love to travel!  I love the excitement of being able to go somewhere to visit.  My toiletry bag from ToiletTree couldn&#x27;t have arrived at a better time.  I took my bag on our recent vacation to Disney World and Myrtle Beach, SC.  I used my bag for my makeup and other things I needed.  The toiletry bag is a nice size bag that can hold my beauty products.  I love using the bag because all of my things were in one place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toiletry bag is sturdy and easy to clean.  I love the handles and the zippers are easy to find and use.  The toiletry bag stores easily in my luggage and doesn&#x27;t take a lot of room.  I am very satisfied with the product as far as size, color, storage, and reliability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toiletry bag comes with 3 TSA approved travel bottles for Shampoo, Conditioner and Body Wash.  A toothbrush case and collapsible cup with pill holder makes traveling easy.</li>
    <li> This is a nice bag. It was priced right and was exactly what was pictured. It was well made and seem quite durable. I am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> The perfect toiletry tote for a man&#x27;s essentials!!! Plenty of room to store the extras, just in case!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second to none!</li>
    <li> I needed a bag like this to hold my beard trimmer and razor. A fine product that comes with TSA approved bottles for traveling. I like it very much.</li>
    <li> Talk about ORGANIZED!!!  Not only is this ToiletTree Travel bag sleek looking but it&#x27;s VERY organized and roomy!! Fully water resistant and I&#x27;ll say it one more time ROOMY!! I love the double stitching and the heavy duty zippers!&lt;br /&gt;To see my full review go to [...]</li>
    <li> Well made and not to big. Better than one I had which didn&#x27;t, fit a lot. Like the different apartments to hold items from each other.</li>
    <li> Holds all of my med bottles and most of my vitamin bottles all in one place in the large compartment.  Beats the heck out of a plastic bag.  Will work great for travel by air.  Easy open/close.  Haven&#x27;t had for a long period but it seems that it will last.</li>
    <li> Planning on some overseas travel, my old shaving kit was looking a tad shabby.  An Amazon.com search turned up this potential replacement.  Excellent choice!  Right down to the the TSA approved containers.  Plenty of room, simple but elegant looking, I am most pleased with my choice out of the many presented on the Amazon site.</li>
    <li> Not as big as i was expecting it too be. Im thinking i might buy another bag to fit in some of my stuff..</li>
    <li> Left my last bag in a hotel and needed to get a replacement in a hurry. This bag is great. I like the opening on the bag, that it comes with a few containers, a separate section in the bottom, and very spacious bag in general. The build quality is solid. Recommended to a friend and he likes it as well.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my dad - his old one looked very similar to this. He loves it - likes the bottom zip part and the size of the main compartment. The only change would probably be to remove the embroidered label. Detracts from the attractiveness of the bag.</li>
    <li> purchased this toiletry bag. It&#x27;s exactly as advertised. It works great for traveling that I do (7+days per months). I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really needed a new toiletry bag, and found this one to be just perfect for my needs!  The price was just right, and the bag is compact, but with enough accessories to travel just right!  Thank you so much for this item, which arrived very quickly!</li>
    <li> This case is well made and has plenty of room for the products I want to carry.  It is not oversized and will fit well into a small suitcase or a carry-on.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This bag was just what I was looking for. Too many of these bags were cheep or had one big pocket that would leave a jumbled mess. ToiletTree&#x27;s bag divides the space up so there&#x27;s an area for larger items, and a separate spot for the smaller ones. I highly recommend this bag.</li>
    <li> Great product Fast service would buy again</li>
    <li> Great quality product!</li>
    <li> It is fine, but I was expecting something that actually looked like leather. More like &amp;#34;pleather&amp;#34; but it gets its job done.</li>
    <li> Its a nice bag, roomy and the bottles in the bottom and toothbrush case are nice extras.  Quick service and delivery.</li>
    <li> I received this bag last year to review and it has been an absolute essential for me ever since. I am finicky about my hair and skin care products, so using hotel product when travelling isn&#x27;t an option for me. Having the convenient bottles which are small enough to take in an airport carry-on and yet hold enough for a 2-3 day trip is so nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the large upper compartment, which easily holds my razor and makeup with room to space. All my skincare, haircare and makeup supplies fit into this bag without a problem and I haven&#x27;t gone on a trip without it since I received it. A must-have for any frequent traveller!</li>
    <li> I liked the functionality of this product based on the description online.  However, when it arrived, the second my husband and I touched, we knew it wasn&#x27;t for us.  The leather feels horrible, soft, but very fake, and flimsy too.  I went to Target and bought the Swiss Army brand for $16, it&#x27;s super good quality, and far superior to this product here.</li>
    <li> Amazing bag, with convenient nooks and crannies to hold all your stuff.  Unfortunately, one of the straps broke, oddly.  However, I called up their customer service, and explained the issue.  They sent a new one in two days!  Bar none customer service.  10/10 would recommend.</li>
    <li> These there a huge hit for the guys I gave them too and I plan on ordering more.</li>
    <li> I like the separate zip up part on the bottom for wet stuff . Have plenty of room to put everything i need for traveling.</li>
    <li> I chose this one because of the accessories and looked well made. When I received it, it was as expected and I was very please with my choice. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I really like the toiletry bag.  Has plenty of room for my personal items and the \\&quot;TSA approved\\&quot; size containers make it easy when flying.</li>
    <li> I already used it on a trip and it was just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> My husband rec&#x27;d this item on time and used it right away for a trip that following week.  He feels it is a great product in that it is very organized and easy to access and travel with.  Loves the containers that come along with it and he feels it will hold up as well and long as his last travel toiletry bag which was about 25 years!  :)</li>
    <li> Great Product, Roomy. Toothbrush is a little smaller than expectations but still a great extra item. Really cool opening design.</li>
    <li> This was briefly described in my original massage. Nice quality material. Without a double bottom, the unit should be deep enough  to cover your bottles in a stand-up fashion. Also a ridged flop-open top that stays open for easy access. Edward</li>
    <li> This is a well-designed toiletry bag.  I especially appreciate that it has two separate compartments, one that&#x27;s smaller for items like shampoo, conditioner, etc (complete with mini bottles), and another that&#x27;s larger for makeup or other items.  The leather is nice as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to Orlando, Florida in a little less than two weeks. Since I&#x27;ll be traveling by car, I will need something to place my hygiene and toiletry products in. When I was contacted by ToiletTree about their new Toiletry Bag, I immediately said yes. The opportunity couldn&#x27;t have came at a more appropriate time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Toiletry Bag is great to keep all of your items organized and protected. The water resistant bag is of really nice quality and is quite durable. It has a large zipper compartment for easy access. There is even a separate zipper compartment located at the bottom of the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that everything is kept in place. The toiletries are strapped down so they are unable to rattle about, which might could cause a mess. Included in this bag are three TSA approved travel bottles, collapsible cup with pill holder and toothbrush case. I like that the travel bottles are specially marked - shampoo, conditioner and body wash. While I&#x27;m not flying to Florida, this will still come in handy. I don&#x27;t like using hotel shampoos, conditioners or body washes. I prefer to use organic, sulfate-free products, and we all know most hotels don&#x27;t carry that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could even use this as a makeup bag. I&#x27;ve always needed one of those ;) I can&#x27;t decide what I&#x27;d prefer to use it for, but for right now...I&#x27;ll use it for it&#x27;s intended purpose. To keep toiletries safe, organized and protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since Father&#x27;s Day is just around the corner, this would make an excellent gift for dad!</li>
    <li> This is a great travel bag! It&#x27;s ergonomically designed to neatly accommodate and protect liquids with a nice sized storage compartment for other items. All of the provided liquid containers are also TSA approved and the fit and finish of the bag itself is very well done.  Highly recommended purchase for frequent travelers.</li>
    <li> This is a very durable bag. I bought it for my husband who works for the railroad and is constantly traveling back and forth form place to place. He is very pleased with the containers that are stored at the bottom of the bag. The bottles eliminated the need to carry bulky shower gel and shampoo bottles, leaving plenty of storage space in the top for other items. This bag fits nicely in the bags he has to carry on the train and doesn&#x27;t take up to much space. I would recommend this bag for men on the go who need a durable bag that can withstand abuse.</li>
    <li> I bought this toiletry bag for my husband as a gift.  He really likes the styling.  The top zipper opening was a real plus.  It makes it easier to find items that have been tossed about during airplane travel. The TSA approved containers in the bottom are used for vitamins and aspirin.  No need to take extra bottles for those items.  It is constructed very well.</li>
    <li> I thought this bag was bigger than my older bag but it wasn&#x27;t. Had it been just a little bigger, I would have rated it a 5 star.</li>
    <li> Man of the house says it is quite roomy and great price. Enjoyed the free toothbrush and bottles too!</li>
    <li> I love this bag. I can now carry all of my makeup, toothbrushing needs, shampoo, conditioner, feminine product, and everything else without fear of spilling anything, losing anything, or havinga sticky mess in the middle of my bag. I highly recommend it. You will love this bag. The top zipper is so convenient and easy for those on the go.</li>
    <li> Love this bag! I ordered one for myself, and I&#x27;m going to order a 2nd one for my husband. It has 2 compartments...one to put things like makeup, toothpaste, etc, and a separate compartment with bottles for shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and a toothbrush holder. My favorite part is the little collaspsible cup. Perfect for traveling!</li>
    <li> I got this bag for my husband for a trip that we have coming up in the next week and we both love it.  It has plenty of storage space and the size of the bottles is just perfect.  We&#x27;re planning to check our luggage, but it&#x27;s nice to know that we could bring this on the plane with us.  I especially like that they bottles are kept in a separate compartment in case of spills.  And unlike his old travel bag that fell apart within days of getting it, this bag is clearly made to last with quality materials.  We look forward to traveling with this bag for years to come!</li>
    <li> This was an excellent purchase.  The bag is nicely made and looks classic. I think the best part is the compartments in the bag force me to stay organized and put the items back in there place after using them.  It&#x27;s a great way to separate out the liquids from the dry tolietry products. The shipping was quick and efficient.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my fiance so he can stop using a zip lock bag. He loves it. He is now truly a man.</li>
    <li> This produce was Ok. It was as advertised. My concern is that the strap on the band that is used to open broke after only one use. I did not send it back because this kit resides in my gym bag. I would have been not too happy if I had given this as a gift.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift and it was a lot bigger than expected. Definitely won&#x27;t have a problem fitting everything inside the bag. It&#x27;s a little too big for a weekend bag or small carry on luggage. It could fit a brush, full size bottle of toothpaste, those big electric razors that guys use...I think the overall quality of the bag is very good.</li>
    <li> Great bag, it&#x27;s been on several trips to Europe with me.</li>
    <li> We were looking for a Men&#x27;s toiletry bag to replace my husband&#x27;s that he&#x27;d had for years! This is the roomiest one I found, and it is very sturdy. Having the toothbrush holder, bottles we filled with shampoo, body wash &amp; conditioner on the bottom saves room for more in the top compartment. He didn&#x27;t want the little expandable cup that came with it, so we store a little floss container, toothpaste &amp; travel mouthwash in that compartment instead.</li>
    <li> A little bigger than I expected but like the TSA approved bottles.</li>
    <li> Great product and service. The size was perfect and the additional bottles were a plus.  Good quality so I believe it will hold up for a while.</li>
    <li> Great leather bag, great amount of space</li>
    <li> My husband travels weekly for work so he goes through his bathroom bags almost monthly. This bag is better made than most of the ones we have tried before. With the inside being waterproof it makes it very easy to clean out if something spills or leaks. The outside is leather so that is easy to clean as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is sturdy and has a lot of storage room. Great travel bag!</li>
    <li> My husband works in the airline industry and is always looking for luggage items that will make travel easier while at the same time allowing him to take all he needs with him. For several years he was using a tiny toiletry bag that was beginning to show a lot of wear and tear. Plus it truly was tiny! He mentioned how he&#x27;s like a bigger bag but didn&#x27;t really have time to look. So I did the looking for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bag really takes traveling light to the next level by giving you more room w/o being cumbersome. Being able to keep the necessary always travel with items in a separate area is GENIUS! He was very happy with this purchase. The outside is sturdy and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this bag to all who travel and need more room for things like electric shavers, etc.</li>
    <li> High Quality Bag-  we were very Happy. We used it with travel tickets for a gift and it worked great</li>
    <li> It is not fine leather but it suits its purpose. Love the lower compartment with the three small bottles for shampoo, conditioner and body wash. Absolutely love the toothbrush carrying case, super convenient. The only downside is I happened to over fill the main carrying case and when drawing the zippers closed the tie between the zipper ends popped off...more than once. Appreciate the green accent in the ToiletTree branding on the side. We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> Innovative design with good use of space.  it is exceptionally easy to open and close.  Nice to have the extra compartment under the bag.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, and he loves it!  He was surprised that the bag had small bottles inside, which is something he really liked.  I definitely will buy another should the need arise!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the Toiletry Bag as it is large enough to hold regular size products versus trial size. The bottom zipper compartment come with three bottles and toothbrush holder which is useless to me, however my wife made quick use of them. The zipper compartment is sizeable and will hold many items. The bag is very will made and arrived in two days through Amazon prime. This is a very good buy versus many of the competitors I looked at.</li>
    <li> Too good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the divisions in the bag. The TSA approved bottles are also excellent. It the best toiletry bag you can ever get.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and simple. A great toiletry kit. Extra compartment ensures that your oddly shaped containers will not be crushed or deformed.</li>
    <li> I needed a Christmas gift for both my husband and my father - both are business men, and both frequent travelers. Although both had good quality luggage to travel with, I noticed that neither had a toilet bag for their toiletries - my father was simply using a ziplock bag! This ToiletTree product was exactly what I was looking for, and suited both men beautifully. It is made of good quality leather, and has a masculine shape and style. It came with a toothbrush cover, and a small foldable plastic cup (which neither of them uses - but I personally considered handy!). The best part about the shape is it packs nicely into their suitcases, making for easy packing in preparation for travel. My husband sometimes uses it even when he is home between trips! Highly recommended. :)</li>
    <li> I trusted the positive reviews I saw for this product and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. I&#x27;m especially impressed by the quality of the case materials. The opening and closing method is great.</li>
    <li> Love the quality of this product. Made out of materials that are sure to last some time. Looking forward to traveling with it.</li>
    <li> Plenty of room and the airline sized bottles take all the guess work out of carrying your favorite shampoo etc on board. I especially liked the dual compartments. ToiletTreeProducts does it again!</li>
    <li> The stitching near the zippers began unraveling after a day or two of my first trip with it. The bottles opened in my luggage after I checked it in for my flight and made a huge mess of shampoo, gel, and mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Wonderful travel bag.  Holds a lot of stuff.  Fits in a suitcase.</li>
    <li> Lots of room for all the necessities for Traveling and than some. You can fit a regular size medicine bottles along, it comes with travel size bottles, but you can use your own. Arrived in Original box and packing material.</li>
    <li> Perfectly compact with ample storage room pus bottles for carrying your favorite shampoos and soaps,,easy to pack and store,great price.</li>
    <li> Just as I am packing for our trip this amazing travel bag arrived and saved us from stuffing our necessities in plastic bags. The compartments are so clever and the approved TSA bottles are perfect. I highly recommend this bag to anyone who leaves their home for a night or more. I intend to keep ours full with the things we need since we are always \\&quot;on the go\\&quot; visiting our grandchildren who live in a different state!</li>
    <li> The product is perfect for holding everything my husband needs for traveling</li>
    <li> My husband loves this, says it is the perfect size and doesn&#x27;t look or feel cheap at all.  He liked the extra toiletry containers that came with it too.  We will be going on a trip soon for 10 days and he was able to get everything he needs to bring with in this bag easily, didn&#x27;t feel cramped or that he couldn&#x27;t find anything in the bag.</li>
    <li> This is the best toiletry bag I ever had and I love the private compartment at the bottom of the bag.&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying another one for a gift!</li>
    <li> Is an improvement on my old bag, and has room for what I need in it.</li>
    <li> Tons of space for how small it looks! Easy to transport and fits very well in a small suitcase/duffle bag.  Zipper stays in place unless you are really rough, unlike the last couple totes I had which lost zipper pulls or just stopped working altogether. The only thing I would change is to substitute a bar soap container for the collapsible cup. The elastic band currently in place doesn&#x27;t stretch far enough to accommodate a bar soap holder.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, courteous service, arrived earlier than expected. Purchased the toiletry bag to replace an old one I inherited. Use it to shower after an intense workout. Large enough to accommodate towel, shampoo, soap, and all my other needs. Like the easy zipper on top. I&#x27;ve seen other guys using the same product so you know it&#x27;s got more than my stamp of approval. You&#x27;re always going to find negative reviews. If customers have problems, they should contact the company and I am confident ToiletTree would resolve them. Buy this bag. You will be pleased!</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I took this on my first trip and have been using it for about 4 months now. It is a great piece of gear. Has multiple section to separate shampoo , conditioner and body wash as well as have a toothbrush holder and little collapsible cub. It is not made of cheap materials and hasn&#x27;t broken on me... worth every penny.</li>
    <li> My husband travels for his job and when he travels he can be gone for a week or more. He had one he thought was a good size, but it really didn&#x27;t hold that much. It was stuffed full with just the basic items and we bought the biggest one the store had. When we received the ToiletTree Toiletry Bag with Accessories we were surprised at the size, it&#x27;s huge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one my husband had was the same length and width of ToiletTree&#x27;s but their was taller by about almost 2 inches! He transferred everything of his to the new one and still had plenty of space to add more in there if he chooses. Personally I think it would make an awesome makeup bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband is loving ToiletTree&#x27;s Toiletry Bag, it will definitely make easier on the road for him. He can easily store full size products in it.</li>
    <li> I had been searching for a toiletry bag for my husband, but didn&#x27;t have much luck finding one at the store. There were certain features I was looking for and ToiletTree Products Toiletry Bag had them all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The double zipper, dual compartments, easy carrying handle and the soft, yet durable material are all things that make this the perfect toiletry bag. There are two compartments to the bag, the main zippered area which is the largest of the two and has been great for storing contact solution, eye glasses, floss and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom compartment comes with three TSA approved travel bottles, collapsible cup with pill holder, and toothbrush case. There is also a zippered pouch which is nice for keeping anything little that may get lost in the larger compartment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a new toiletry bag this is one I would recommend.</li>
    <li> The handle on the zipper broke off completely after only having it a month.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, nice, and convenient. Great for my son to travel with and appreciate the accessories included that are conducive for airport travel.</li>
    <li> Very well constructed.  Roomy, with nice access of double zipper opening.  The separate storage on the bottom is a great bonus space!</li>
    <li> This bag was exactly what my husband needed on the road for all his medicines,as he travels the 48 states. However I choose that rating because the rivet fell off strap that unzips and zips the bag opened and closed.we sewed buttons where the rivet belongs so he could use it.  We did not have the time to return it and wait for a new one. He is very happy to have all the stuff in it, and not in a plastic Walmart bag.</li>
    <li> If you need a toiletry bag ,you have to have this one. I love the design of this bag. Believe me this has it all. The double zipper is my favorite feature. Great product ,and a good price.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband and he loves it. This is much nicer than the one we replaced, this one is very durable and will last a long time.  He likes the travel accessories it comes with.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty big.  Its easy to tell that it has nice quality.  It won&#x27;t break for awhile.  Pretty well satisfied.</li>
    <li> Great bag for traveling. Everything I need fit perfectly. The bag itself is well made and has plenty of room in the top compartment.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift.  The item was packaged nicely and arrived on the promised date.  The recipient had requested a toiletry bag with double zippers for easy access to what was in the bag.  These are hard to find!  He was very pleased with his gift...especially the bonus travel bottles and toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price. Roomy with a separate compartment on the bottom for the small bottles that it comes with. Perfect for travel. Zippers work without sticking. Side handle makes it easy to carry. Fits perfectly in a large gym bag.</li>
    <li> I bought this bag for my husband (who&#x27;s super picky) for a week long business trip.  Normally he couldn&#x27;t fit everything in his old bag, but this one has PLENTY of room and extra compartments.  He&#x27;s bald so he gave the little shampoo/conditioner bottles to me, but other than that it is perfect!  Nice quality leather too!  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> 👍 It was just perfect, exactly what I expected!</li>
    <li> Perfect bag for my needs.</li>
    <li> I was very fortunate recently to recieve this great bag because we are actually going on vacation starting on the 26th of July, so my husband was very excited to get this travel bag to put all of his things in! He said now he would not have to share the same bag with me and have to go thru all of my makeup and medicines to find what he was looking for! Mmm, very ungrateful sort of thing, don&#x27;t you think? I did laugh though, because he is right, when we used to go places the toiletry bag ended up being almost as big as a carry on! We got this product from Toilet Tree and my husband says to send you a big THANK YOU!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really is a nice soft black leather and is very roomy inside and I have no doubt that all of hubby&#x27;s things will all fit in there. He thinks I carry alot of stuff, but so does he! And we are gonna be gone a little over 2 weeks so he is gonna have to stuff that thing plum full! As you can see from this picture, the top part of the bag unzips and there is a place for a can of shaving cream and a small towel in there. Course, hubby does not use shaving cream but his electric shaver will go in there nicely with his bottle of mouthwash. (he never leaves home without mouthwash, it&#x27;s almost a sin to him talk about it!)</li>
    <li> This bag is cheap and plastic...big disappointment. My husband continues to use his old dop kit instead of switching to this poorly made one.</li>
    <li> I like it , it has good space and quality product , I liked the stitching of the product .&lt;br /&gt;Overall value for money</li>
    <li> Husband loves this bag, great for traveling for work.</li>
    <li> Very nice but broke a bit too soon.</li>
    <li> Pretty good size shave kit. Made from high quality material.  Seems very durable.  I don&#x27;t use the bottles provided but put all of my shaving gear in the bottom.</li>
    <li> The lining ripped after 1 day of use. I actually filled the bag a quarter to half full at MOST. Sales price should be $5 vs $30. Definitely not worth it.</li>
    <li> Great bag. Holds everything.</li>
    <li> Great product, quick service.  I don&#x27;t think I should be required to say a certaqinh number if things  or I will quit reviewing at all.</li>
    <li> I was recently given the opportunity to use and review this great Toiletry Bag with Travel Accessories. This toiletry bag is designed to organize all the toiletries you might need while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a separate compartment on the bottom of the bag, which is specially designed to hold airline approved travel bottles and other travel accessories. The main portion of the heavy duty bag has a rather roomy, double zipper compartment, perfect for storing makeup, face lotion and shaving supplies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I don&#x27;t do a lot of traveling, I have found a great use for this product. I have found it&#x27;s absolutely perfect for carrying items I need when I go to the gym. I can throw my makeup in the double zip top compartment, along with a travel sized toothpaste, some lotion, add my shampoo, conditioner, body wash and extra toothbrush in the bottom compartment, and just grab the bag and carry it to the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having my shampoo, conditioner and body wash stored in their own separate compartment also helps them stop getting lost when carrying them loosely in my gym bag. And, knowing that this bag has an easy to clean nylon fabric interior, which is completely water resistant, now I no longer have to worry about my toiletries spilling on my workout gear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in need of a handy travel bag, be sure to check out the ToiletTree Products Toiletry Bag with Travel Accessories (TSA Approved Bottles) . I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find it as useful as I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free from the company that makes this product.</li>
    <li> Nice for frequent travellers..Fits lot of things..</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Excellent customer service. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I ordered this bag to replace one I have had for many, many years. It holds a lot of stuff and has a nice storage place in the bottom.  The only drawback I have with this bag is that you have to lay the bag on it&#x27;s side to get to the bottom storage area. If you forget to zip the top first (Like I have done a couple of times) you will dump the stuff in the top out.  I&#x27;m sure I will get used to it in time. It seems to be made of good material and I expect it to last a long time. Probably longer than I will.</li>
    <li> fits all essentials great!! no mess!</li>
    <li> Nice bag and a lot bigger than I thought it would be. I&#x27;m a wet shaver and as many of us do, I have a plethora of shaving equipment to use and I can for my normally used items nicely in the bag to unclutter my counter to make room for SWMBO&#x27;s clutter. Plus the bottom half is plenty big enough to fit my other travel toiletries when it&#x27;s time to pack up and go. I agree that it is not a back pack sized bag. It&#x27;s sturdy and probably wouldn&#x27;t do well getting squished, but that&#x27;s not what I was going for. Soft lined and sturdy, modern leather bag. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this as gift for my dad who loves it!  Bag is well made with enough space for everything.  The electric toothbrush was a bonus and my dad was thrilled.  I may need to buy one for my husband too!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loved his new cosmetic bag. He travels so this helps keep everything in one place. Its nice quality and lots of room for storage.</li>
    <li> This bag is very nice and holds a lot of things.</li>
    <li> Looks great, compact but lots of room.</li>
    <li> I love this item it&#x27;s a prefect product for anyone that needs to keep there items in order. Recently, my friend was going on a trip and after buying all of of  the small bottle Toilet Tree products for her trip. At the last minute she found out she could not bring them on the plane due to  TSA regulations. She was very stress and in a panic, however, I was able to give her mine to take on her trip. Once she came back and return my bag,I was still able to reuse all of my items for my next trip. In addition the bag is durable. I would recommend this bag if you are needing one for your next vacation.</li>
    <li> Great product but not the best feeling leather. Has plenty of space for what I need plus much more</li>
    <li> Holding up quite well, as promised by other reviews. Now I smell good, feel good, and look good all at the same time without rummaging through every pocket of my suitcase.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t come with a travel sonic toothbrush, but that&#x27;s neat.&lt;br /&gt;The bottles aren&#x27;t very high quality and better ones can be found.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice lining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this bag because a) I wanted it to contain a leak, b) has lots of room, c) looks nice, d) has a clever pun (ToiletTree.. cute).&lt;br /&gt;It has flown over 30,000 miles in my bag and will hold everything I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the more expensive bags are upwards of $50, but I think this one is a good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with quality of product.</li>
    <li> Good looking bag and  the size is great.  However, the zipper broke so while it still holds, things fall out making it really unusable for traveling.  And that&#x27;s what it was bought for.  I bought it as a birthday present 1-2 weeks prior so cannot be replaced because the 1 month window just ran out this past weekend.  So it was really only used for about 3 weeks.  So to wrap it up, zipper broke, used for about 3 weeks and a few days past the 30 day return window.</li>
    <li> I purchased this bag and the zipper broke the first few days I had it. I do not recommend this purchase because of the poor quality.</li>
    <li> Perfect bag for the husband who travels for work all the time. Holds his clarisonic, toothbrush, toothpaste, lotion, cologne, and deodorant. The bag looks amazing and is large.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  We recently went to New York, and I was able to give this bag a huge run.  It is a great bag!  I love how much this thing holds!  I also love that it is airport safe, so you can put your liquids in the containers and get through security without having to buy special small stuff.  This is will the only bag we will travel with again.</li>
    <li> One of my habits when I go on vacation is to take everything with me ... clothes, makeup, hair products, etc.  ToiletTree was kind enough to let me try out their Toiletry Bag with TSA approved bottles in it. I love this bag!  It actually fit my big hair straighter in it, as well as all my makeup that I think I&#x27;ll take to Jamaica! As I said, I take a lot of stuff.  This is almost nothing compared to what I usually take. I need to remember to add my other hair products to my checked bags or else I&#x27;ll be lost! I put all my powdered products into a small makeup bag, but if you do not want to it is fine.  The interior is  easily cleaned by just a damp cloth!This bag is made of high quality materials, with a leather like outside.  The inside is made of a canvas type of material, so it is perfect if you take makeup and it accidentally spills - easy to clean up.  It is stitched in white, which allows for an expensive quality to it.  The top compartment holds many things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom has the bottles to out your shampoo, conditioner, and body wash in.  I use a ton of conditioner at the beach, so I will more than likely take the entire thing in my checked luggage.  I hate having dry hair and salt water does it to mine  but also makes it look so nice when it is wavy!</li>
    <li> We used this bag on our most recent trip to visit family. It held everything we needed with no worries of our shampoo or body wash accidently leaking on our clothes. There was plenty of room for all our toiletries, hair accessories, hair brush, medicines and a few other small items we didn&#x27;t want to loose track of. This bag came in very handy and will definitely be used on all of our future trips!</li>
    <li> This toiletry bag is well-made and spacious! The top zipper compartment holds brushes, shaving cream and makeup and the little bottles are perfect to use when flying. I just took the bottles out and put them in a gallon sized Ziploc bag, since that&#x27;s the speedy way to get through the checkpoint (if you&#x27;re not checking your bags). Makes an excellent gift for the frequent traveler.</li>
    <li> I bought this item on Amazon Prime for my husband as one of his Christmas gifts. He had been on the lookout for a travel case which would be able hold all of his toiletries and accessories. Needless to say this item turned out to be the perfect one for him. It not not looks elegant but also holds all his items including his big can of body spray very easily. Both compartments are roomy and can be used for storing various sorts of bottles, cans and gadgets. The zipper is smooth and works like a charm.  My husband used it recently on our 9-day trip to Disneyworld and claims that it is the most convenient travel case he has ever owned. I&#x27;m glad I found this on Amazon and would recommend it to everyone looking for a similar product.</li>
    <li> Not the highest grade leather but then again a very well made . The bottom storage area leaves plenty of room in the top of kit for bulky items. I am diabetic so I must carry many different items and they all fit nicely in the top. The double zipper is nice also. Wish they had more colors so my wife could get one. She does not wany black.</li>
    <li> My nephew loves it he just went into army and this will be going every were with him!</li>
    <li> I got this one for hubby and love it!  This is a great little addition for traveling and keeps everything neatly organized and easy to get to.  The quality is exceptional and I love that the inner lining is water-proof.  He likes all the individual bottles and how easy it is to keep it clean.</li>
    <li> Looks great, is nice in terms of size, can fit quite a bit of stuff for the guy&#x27;s out there like myself. There is nothing I don&#x27;t like about the bag. I think it&#x27;s well made, and should last quite some time. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
