      <li>I liked the bin but from pictufrde of it thought i would get not just one bin but one ontop of another .</li>

      <li>They break very easily.  </li>
      <li>which makes me a very happy old timer</li>
      <li>Wow, these are wonderful.  </li>
      <li>That pulls against my neck and isn&#x27;t very comfortable.</li>
      <li>Very secure.  </li>
      <li>I have never used one of this type of thing, and found it a bit too bothersome to have those rubber things touching my face sometimes, and now the retainer is in my clutter drawer.</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing more.</li>
      <li>I am going to order another one just to make sure I never have to do without one on hand.  </li>
      <li>I have used many different glass retainers and this is the best because once the part (do not know to call it)</li>
      <li>Slide on easy and have a good strong grip so they won&#x27;t break easily.</li>
      <li>So I felt safe ordering some more.</li>
      <li>and I would not hesitate to get more.</li>
      <li>These are the perfect length and manly enough for him!</li>
      <li>They arrived very timely and in great shape as did the three pack.</li>
      <li>I will need more days to come.&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
      <li>/&gt;Saving one pair from breaking/loosing, will more then pay for my peeper-keepers.</li>
      <li>The plasticized ends that are inserted onto the limbs of the eyeglasses are hold the ends safely.  </li>
      <li>The rubber is much more durable.</li>
      <li>what more could you want?</li>
      <li>Much better than retail stores.</li>
      <li>Already bought more.  </li>
      <li>Fast and reliable (and great product: much better than Crokies.</li>
      <li>The best and longest lasting retainers around.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t know how happy this  eyeglass Retainer has made this old timer!</li>
      <li>I use the peeper-keeper everyday and am most impressed with it&#x27;s durability.</li>
      <li>Easy to slip on, and they have stayed on.</li>
      <li>I used these for my reading glasses and they worked just fine until I caught the retainer on my winter coat collar  during a storm.  </li>
      <li>I contacted the seller and they quickly sent my order out again!</li>
      <li>For the price this little thing is one of my best purchases.  </li>
      <li>Length is good, cord is fine as far as thickness and comfort</li>
      <li>I wanted something that would stay on well and would fit any of my glasses - these are so great that I bought a back up.</li>
      <li>I liked these so much, I ordered a three pack.</li>
      <li>These are my new favorite item!  </li>
      <li>I have always had difficulties because the temple and earpieces of my specs are very narrow but the Peeper Keepers fit and stay in place perfectly.</li>
      <li>It looks like the cord was originally glued when connected with the rubber holder.</li>
      <li>This is not a user friendly purchase.</li>
      <li>Positioned in the right place to not touch my face, THEY DON&#x27;T MOVE!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true that it gets lose with time, and it may even break.</li>
      <li>Great value!&lt;br /&gt;Bought other fancy eyeglass holders at doctor.</li>
      <li>My first order got lost in the mail!</li>
      <li>Finally a retainer that does not allow the glasses to slip off--so glad to have found these--I&#x27;ve tried many kinds and usually the ends break, don&#x27;t hold in place and are useless--I&#x27;m stocking up on more of these, for sure!</li>
      <li>Just love them instead of those yucky things with the little plastic &amp;#34;rubber band&amp;#34; kind of thing on the ends.</li>
      <li>The glasses do not slip out, it is light weight and reasonably priced.  </li>
      <li>so not that don&#x27;t get it and get something that worth the money.</li>
      <li>Clearly, this one was defective, but how many are?</li>
      <li>Another thing is the length of the string is 26 inches, which I like because it does not feel like the glasses are right under my chin.</li>
      <li>The price is right, too.</li>
      <li>In one the rubber part that holds the glass frames tore right where the frame slides through the holder.</li>
      <li>They are easy to apply and just as simple to remove, all the while holding my eyeglasses securely.</li>
      <li>I had these in the past and was happy with them.</li>
      <li>Nice looking and convenient, but didn&#x27;t take long for them to break.  </li>
      <li>Most retail outlets do not have this simple but well manufactured retainer.  </li>
      <li>One broke the first time I used it</li>
      <li>These were a lot higher than ebay and junk store</li>
      <li>DOES EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Helps to keep track of glasses.  Works great.</li>
    <li> BROKE WITHIN 2 WEEKS, WOULDN&#x27;T PURCHASE THIS ITEM AGAIN</li>
    <li> they actually stay on the glasses and save me from misplacing by glasses yet again. They are inconspicuous because I ordered black.</li>
    <li> These are the best eyeglass retainers I have ever owned. Others are softer and wear out much faster</li>
    <li> Since I found these cords, I have never used anything else! I couldn&#x27;t use any pair of glasses that hadn&#x27;t a \\&quot;two-parted\\&quot; side (always metal frames), otherwise the cords would slide off all the time (with regular cords, the frame must have that narrower part on the sides, where the cord will stay without sliding). I was frustrated because I would find many stylish eyeglasses that were in plastic, with wide sides without any narrower part. I tried to wear them, but it was a waste of time. The cords would always slide off, and the glasses would fall down. That was until I found THESE cords. No more boring, fragile metallic frames since then! I buy whatever frame I want, hold them with my Peeper Keeper cord, and it lasts for a long, long time, without ever sliding off! It&#x27;s true that it gets lose with time, and it may even break. But be assured that you&#x27;ll have them for a long time before that happens.</li>
    <li> Very high quality, but they are just a little too small to use. Needs to be about 2 to 3&amp;#34;s longer, then they would be great.</li>
    <li> I adore these eyeglass holders.  They are easy to apply and just as simple to remove, all the while holding my eyeglasses securely. The plasticized ends that are inserted onto the limbs of the eyeglasses are hold the ends safely.  This is a terrific item for my sun glasses here in the California Central Valley where sun glare is common even in winter. Protect your eyes, ladies and gentlemen, use sun screen, and moisturize to prevent aging wrinkles around the delicate skin surrounding one&#x27;s eyes.</li>
    <li> Excellentm- holds eye glasses</li>
    <li> It aready came apart....waste of money!!!!!!!!!  It lasted for about 2 weeks and the rubber came loose from the rope.</li>
    <li> I find this keeper to be the correct length for my body. The little rubber doolies on the ends went over the ends of the temples of my readers easily, and then stayed put: not slipping forward or backward...but rotating a bit under stresses. I have never used one of this type of thing, and found it a bit too bothersome to have those rubber things touching my face sometimes, and now the retainer is in my clutter drawer. That said, for what it&#x27;s intended to do, this seems like a good product.</li>
    <li> Good enough for the price but not long wearing. Rubber split after a few months. Very thin cord.</li>
    <li> Never lose your glasses again!</li>
    <li> holds ordinary glasses very firmly. not meant for sunglasses with wider frame. It is rather expensive as  it is meant for limited use only.</li>
    <li> Great value!&lt;br /&gt;Bought other fancy eyeglass holders at doctor. Fell apart. These show no sign of any problems. Plain Jane but do the job!</li>
    <li> These work well. Easy to slip on, and they have stayed on.</li>
    <li> The best and longest lasting retainers around. Just love them instead of those yucky things with the little plastic &amp;#34;rubber band&amp;#34; kind of thing on the ends.</li>
    <li> These are the only eyeglass holders that really work and last.  They don&#x27;t wear out and drop your glasses.  A permanent element of my wardrobe since I wear contacts and readers.</li>
    <li> Best eyeglass retainer I have used.</li>
    <li> I have looked all over for a simple eye glass retainer.  Most retail outlets do not have this simple but well manufactured retainer.  Shipped on time and packaged correctly.  I recommend them to my friends when they ask &amp;#34;where did you buy your retainer&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I have still not seen this product at this great price in ANY retail stores.</li>
    <li> Wow, these are wonderful.  I put this item on my glasses and now never lose my glasses.  I had the regular ones previously and my glasses fell off twice without my knowing it.  I was very lucky in retracing my steps to find them, but these solved my problem entirely.  Won&#x27;t buy anything else.  My glasses slip off my nose, but never off my neck.  Ten stars and VERY highly recommended for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to keep a pair of reading glasses in every room of the home (which doesn&#x27;t work anyway).</li>
    <li> The tips are too bulky.  Of course, if they were smaller, they might not stay on the glasses as required.</li>
    <li> We have searched high and low for this type of eyeglass retainer for months.  He bought one as the eye doctors office but then they stopped selling the kind with the rubber end.  I will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this twice. Both times the black rubber holding the glasses disintegrated and weakened. Eventually broke both times.  I sent email to the seller and they said the problem was my glasses Not true. The arm of my glasses is not very wide, so this was not the problem. They would not send me another pair or refund me  I ordered something similar on amazon and with much better results. The rubber is much more durable. Also was as inexpensive as these</li>
    <li> this thing doesn&#x27;t hold up, and after using them for 2 weeks the rubbers came off. so not that don&#x27;t get it and get something that worth the money.</li>
    <li> The overall low quality might have been OK, if it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that they&#x27;re also too long! I&#x27;m a tall guy - and these hang down below my sternum. I&#x27;ve had to shorten the length (without cutting) by tying a portion at the back of my neck. I didn&#x27;t realize that something this simple could be screwed up this bad. They also came packaged in individual, unlabeled zip-lock bags - they did not include any \\&quot;Peeper-Keeper\\&quot; packaging as the photo implies.</li>
    <li> If you want an eyeglass retainer that really does the job  this is it</li>
    <li> granted, it was used everyday - but two weeks?? Ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;a simple dollar store one i had previously lasted 3 months!</li>
    <li> I have used many different glass retainers and this is the best because once the part (do not know to call it) that connects to the glasses never needs to be re-adjusted. Actually, it never needs to be tighten the first time since the glass frame is put in a glove like holder that grips the frame and never loses it tension.    Another thing is the length of the string is 26 inches, which I like because it does not feel like the glasses are right under my chin. I use them on all of my glasses including sunglasses.     One warning: if you have a big dog (Lab or similar size) that can put their paws on your chest, the glasses need to be removed because these holders have no give and any downward pressure will pop the rubber end off the string. There is no way to fix that because the rubber glove is not designed to re-thread the string back into the hole. It is a small price to pay for the comfort of these holders, though I lost a couple of pair before learning to simply take my glasses off around the dog.</li>
    <li> I just got a couple of  pairs of these less than a week ago. I like the longer cord. I tied a knot in it to get the length I wanted. Unfortunately one of the two pairs failed already.  The cord just pulled out of the rubber end and it is not repairable.  I had a pair of Croaker&#x27;s that lasted for a year. I will stick with them.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t slide off the frames like others do.</li>
    <li> Great item to help me not lose my glasses.</li>
    <li> Holds on well to my lightweight plastic reading glasses.  The length is perfect so the glasses stay out of the way when they&#x27;re &amp;#34;down&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Complete garbage- the plastic pieces came off/separated from the cord at the slightest pull ! This retainer is a sure way to lose your glasses !</li>
    <li> Exceeded all of my expectations (that&#x27;s why I had to go back and order several more)!  Will order again if necessary!  Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months. Length is good, cord is fine as far as thickness and comfort but I caught it on something a few days ago and the cord pulled out of the rubber holder. I was able to push it back in but it won&#x27;t stay. :( Too flimsy in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I use the peeper-keeper everyday and am most impressed with it&#x27;s durability. I highly recommend this product to those who wear eyeglasses.</li>
    <li> I am using it and helpful for me.&lt;br /&gt;Good quality.I will need more days to come.&lt;br /&gt;Look small but helpful.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyeglass cord i ever bought.. Good product,good price..thank you</li>
    <li> For the price this little thing is one of my best purchases.  I frequently take my glasses on and off.  With this little device I now always know where the are, on my neck.  Absolutely will not slop off as most of my far more expensive holders always seemed to do.  I couldn&#x27;t believe their cost. I am going to order another one just to make sure I never have to do without one on hand.  Bet Buy!</li>
    <li> did not feel the quality of the product was very good. It always felt like a black string. the nice part of it is the clasp used to hold them on.</li>
    <li> The Peeper-Keepers work. They keep my cheaters&lt;br /&gt;close by. I used to drop my glasses or could not find them.&lt;br /&gt;Saving one pair from breaking/loosing, will more then pay for my peeper-keepers.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my dad. He&#x27;s always losing his glass&#x27;s but now he doesn&#x27;t thanks to these wonderful retainer. He&#x27;s had it for a while now and its still in great condition</li>
    <li> I wanted something that would stay on well and would fit any of my glasses - these are so great that I bought a back up.</li>
    <li> These really grip the arms of my glasses and don&#x27;t slide around at all. They stay where you put them.  I go through a lot of eyeglass retainers and these are the best I&#x27;ve found.  The price is right, too.</li>
    <li> These really work on keeping glasses in place.  In addition, they do not slip off as so many other types do</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this product. It only lasted a little over a week and one of the rubber ends came off.</li>
    <li> Have these for little more than a week and one side is now not holding the glasses due to expansion. Once the hole expands they are useless because you can&#x27;t adjust them to be tighter. The glasses now just fall off my face at the worst of times. These things are worthless, not worth a penny. Would never again buy this junk.</li>
    <li> Pretty basic, but it works.  Difficult to remove, if ever want to.  I&#x27;ve bought other varieties of Peeper Keepers that were easier put on and take off.</li>
    <li> Cord disconnected from eyeglass connector in  week with not even a hard accidental tug!  Since there are 2 cords in the package, I tried the other one - same thing happened in another few days.  A waste of money!</li>
    <li> I bought the cord eight month ago, and use it every day. The frame holders still as tight as they were on the beginning. I would recommend this item to everybody who uses glasses with plastic frame. I do not think it will work for thin metal frame as good as for wider one.</li>
    <li> While these retainers work well (the rubber is sturdy and secure), the actual length of the rope is too long and gets in the way. For example, they continuously get caught under the handle bar on a grocery cart (or Target cart, etc.). The glasses are then compromised because they get pulled on. I am 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; tall and while I do like the way they&#x27;re made, I find I have to throw them over my shoulder onto my back when not in use. That pulls against my neck and isn&#x27;t very comfortable. The rope length can not be adjusted so buyer beware.</li>
    <li> Fell apart the day it arrived.</li>
    <li> The minute I hooked it onto my reading glasses it felt great and snug. Unfortunately it lasted two days an snapped from the cord. I recieved a new set but this broke also.</li>
    <li> Low quality (you get what you pay for, I guess.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rubber frame grips split after a few months of easy use.</li>
    <li> I really like these Peeper Keepers. They are strong and seem like they will last a long time. The length is good too. I liked these so much, I ordered a three pack. I use reading glasses and it seems I have a pair in almost every room. They arrived very timely and in great shape as did the three pack.</li>
    <li> These are the answer to the regular ones that always get loose and slide off the arms. These do not slip at all and will last a long time.</li>
    <li> These could have been perfect except the rubber tips grasp onto my hair and won&#x27;t let go.  It&#x27;s very painful to get off and on.  I can&#x27;t use them in any practical way.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I have used retainers for years and have always had trouble with the tabs becoming loose.  These are the best I have found.  They do not come loose and I would not hesitate to get more.</li>
    <li> Well it worked fine for a few days but after awhile the holders were not functioning.  This is not a user friendly purchase.</li>
    <li> The straps work good, but the clips that hold them on are a little bulky and if not positioned properly are a little uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> The rubber grips on the sides of glasses hold on to glasses so much better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried!  I have glasses on and off and on and off all day long at work, and it is better to avoid misplacing or losing glasses, or worse, sitting on them, by having them hang around the neck!</li>
    <li> This is the best design for an eyeglass cord you wear to work.  Doesn&#x27;t slide around and doesn&#x27;t need to be cinched.</li>
    <li> These are my new favorite item!  I don&#x27;t leave home without them!&lt;br /&gt;They hold my glasses perfectly, and when on my face, I don&#x27;t feel the holder at all.</li>
    <li> Nice looking and convenient, but didn&#x27;t take long for them to break.  They were nice while they lasted, but I won&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
    <li> I use these for my surgical loupes.  They are study enough to hold their weight and have enough rubber where it counts for me to be confident the&#x27;ll last longer than the cord that came with the loupes.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> Now, I do not have to prop my glasses on my head or tuck the ear piece into my clothing.  It is very convenient.</li>
    <li> I have used similar products for several years but the Peeper Keeper is superior to the others, by far. I have always had difficulties because the temple and earpieces of my specs are very narrow but the Peeper Keepers fit and stay in place perfectly. Try &#x27;em, you&#x27;ll like &#x27;em.</li>
    <li> The glass holders work, but they tend to hold the earpieces open instead of allowing them to lie flat when not in use.  But it&#x27;s a small price to pay to keep your glasses around your neck instead of on the floor when the tip breaks or slides off the earpieces.  It works well.</li>
    <li> My first order got lost in the mail! I contacted the seller and they quickly sent my order out again! This one came within the time frame stated.The design of the Keepers is nice they don&#x27;t pull my hair or poke me in the side of the head, like rubberband and spring type do!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks! Peeper Keepers</li>
    <li> Finally a retainer that does not allow the glasses to slip off--so glad to have found these--I&#x27;ve tried many kinds and usually the ends break, don&#x27;t hold in place and are useless--I&#x27;m stocking up on more of these, for sure!</li>
    <li> One of the rubber ends broke after a week.  Just tore in half.  I wasn&#x27;t tough on it.  I put this on my glasses and a week later one of the ends tore open while pulling my glasses from a pocket in my bag.  Clearly, this one was defective, but how many are?</li>
    <li> I bought these after I broke the second or third pair of glasses in a year. I can&#x27;t see to read wearing my glasses, and hated bifocals- plus can read fine without any glasses at all. Unfortunately, to read, look at iPhone or iPad, I have to take glasses off, and I have a tendency to just toss them anywhere- see above re broken glasses! I wanted to try a cord on them, thinking if I kept them around my neck, they would be safer . Getting to the point, while I have not had these long enough to test my theory, these are made out of such bulky cord they are uncomfortable. They do seem well made, and the gizmo that connects cord to glasses is one of the best I have seem, but that doesn&#x27;t help much if they are too uncomfortable to wear. If you routinely use a cord on your sunglasses, that might not be a problem for you.</li>
    <li> Very nice keeper. Now I don&#x27;t  have to worry about fixing my sliding eyeglass holders all the time. What else should I say?</li>
    <li> these really grip, don&#x27;t come off the glasses and the line is long enough to take off without messing up your hair.  I mistakenly told someone they were adjustable.  They are not.  The cord is 28\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Great price. Much better than retail stores.</li>
    <li> They break very easily.  Pop loose with small tug.  I was very disappointed with these.  Good idea.  Doesn&#x27;t hold up.</li>
    <li> I had these in the past and was happy with them. So I felt safe ordering some more. I bought 3 retainers of 3 different colors. All three of them broke within a week. And they all broke at the junction of the rubber holder and the neck cord. In one the rubber part that holds the glass frames tore right where the frame slides through the holder. So they could no longer hold any glasses. The other two broke when the cord pulled out of the rubber holder. It looks like the cord was originally glued when connected with the rubber holder. Both times it looked like the glue just let go and out popped the cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend these to anyone unless they are a do-it-yourself repair person. Otherwise, I am sad to say these are of poor quality and little use.</li>
    <li> It definitely grabs onto your glasses!! The opening is very tight, and snug. And yes: it can fit any size: skinny or larger. It is very flexible, made of soft rubber that adapts to the thickness of your glasses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend, mainly after having to throw an expensive leather one, away.</li>
    <li> I used these for my reading glasses and they worked just fine until I caught the retainer on my winter coat collar  during a storm.  I lifted the collar and broke the retainer.</li>
    <li> I bought one and have now bought a Peeper-Keeper for all my readers.  The grips work GREAT.  They do not loosen or slide around and they really do fit on multiple size glasses.  Try these.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I will never buy another kind of eyeglass retainers! They don&#x27;t slip or slide, and the bonus is that the cord is longer than the usual ones allowing me to wear my favorite necklace without it scratching my lenses! Positioned in the right place to not touch my face, THEY DON&#x27;T MOVE! Whomever designed these, Thank You!</li>
    <li> On plus side they have sturdy, grippy rubber ends with an aperture 9/32\\&quot; long by 2/32\\&quot; wide, so think they would work on wide frame glasses like safety glasses and sun glasses(haven&#x27;t tried) but still hold fine on regular thin readers. Also the cord is plenty long enough, unlike the croakie \\&quot;tite end\\&quot; I just tried. Actually too long for me, which leads to the downside. Too shorten just tie a knot except this is pia to do and keep both ends same length, so they should have put an adjuster in. Main negatve issue is, the rope feels fragile, just thin soft material. Doubt it will hold up long for active people. Of course, you could buy two of these for what my next purchase/trial, the Chums \\&quot;slip fit\\&quot;, will cost so not a bad choice and it just depends on your priorities. I&#x27;m personally looking for something sturdier to buy several of but will keep these.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  The glasses do not slip out, it is light weight and reasonably priced.  what more could you want?</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these eyeglass retainers.  One broke the first time I used it and I had to send it back.  The company replaced it.  Since then a second one has broken--same way as the first.  The rope pulls out of the rubber attachments when any pressure is put on it.  Would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Tried a bunch of other styles. I like the way that these work the best. Easy to put on and holds the glasses well w/o slipping.</li>
    <li> The rubber grippers held the thin plastic earpieces of my glasses very well.  But the attachment of the cord to the rubber grippers depends entirely on friction--it&#x27;s just a slippery nylon cord held by a tight hole in rubber.  So there&#x27;s nothing to prevent the cord from pulling out with a moderate pull.  This happened within a few weeks with both of mine, despite handling the 2nd very carefully after it happened to the 1st.  Then it&#x27;s really hard to get the cord back into the hole--an icepick might work, or might just destroy the cord &amp; tear up the hole.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Already bought more.  They do not stick into my head or ears.  In fact you don&#x27;t know they are there.  Slide on easy and have a good strong grip so they won&#x27;t break easily.</li>
    <li> These work like they are supposed to.</li>
    <li> Good product; good value</li>
    <li> These work as described, and being I have thicker side thingys..... can&#x27;t think of the name of the bar that goes from glasses to ear..... anyhow these slide onto them and are made of rubber so they hug tight the glasses and make it easy since I only need mine to read but do that constantly so on and off and thus this retainer as they call it keeps them around my neck and help them from getting scratched.by being on me and not on a desk or tossed on a table.</li>
    <li> Fast and reliable (and great product: much better than Crokies.</li>
    <li> These are the best eyeglass retainers EVER.  I bought several, to keep on-hand because I expected them to fall apart as other retainers have in the past.  Well these retainers last a long time.  I have been wearing the same one, every day,  for a year-and-a-half!!!</li>
    <li> DOES EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED I NEED FOR WORK BRILLIANT THANK YOU</li>
    <li> The subject line said it all.  I recommend the product.  I&#x27;ve brought this one after purchased (3 Apex Eyeglass Holder Fashion Cordsz) and have it all broken within 2 weeks.  This one last :).</li>
    <li> My hubby was always misplacing his glasses at home and when he was out in the field. These are the perfect length and manly enough for him!</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t know how happy this  eyeglass Retainer has made this old timer!.. if I didn&#x27;t have access to&lt;br /&gt;a computer, I&#x27;d never ever know about this terrific eyeglass retainer, for thats how I learned about it!.. this little do hickey ; doesn&#x27;t slide around like most of them do. It  stays put  which makes me a very happy old timer indeed!..&lt;br /&gt;And, I&#x27;ll be ordering another one soon!..</li>
    <li> Met all my expectations. My glasses&#x27; stems are smooth all the way along, and other retainers slipped off. The Peeper Keepers grip well, even on my skinny stems, and stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added 3 months later: The rubber pieces that grip the stems has absorbed some skin oil (I&#x27;m extra oily), so they&#x27;ve stretched some and don&#x27;t grip so tightly. But they all do that, in my experience. The way these are designed, though, means they still don&#x27;t slip off easily--I&#x27;m still using them. Also, they&#x27;re thick enough that they don&#x27;t break the way other leash grippers have. So I&#x27;ll still give them five stars, relative to other leashes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Basically good product. Under strain the rubber ends separate from the cord. I was able to poke it in a few times, and the strain required is considerable, but not enormous.</li>
    <li> The darned thing broke the first time my husband used it - the cord came out of the rubber piece. I tried to push it back in but it came out a hole in the rubber plug, and the rubber stretched and broke.&lt;br /&gt;I have not yet contacted the seller - hope I can get a refund.</li>
    <li> These are half to one third the price of other eyeglass retainers I looked at. The product is simple, unobtrusive, and gets the job done. Unless you want to make a fashion statement, I think this is the product.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE THE BEST GLASSES HOLDER I FOUNDER I GO TO SLEEP IN MY RECLINER SOME TIMES AND THESE HOLD THE BEST WHEN I DO THAT.&lt;br /&gt;BILL MARTIN</li>
    <li> I bought this item because I wanted something to keep my glasses from slidng down my nose why I sweat. I live in Phoenix Arizona so when I ride my bike or jog, keeping my glasses on is a real and continuous problem. However this product fails to do that because the strap is way to long and can not be adjusted. This product is intended to be used by someone who needs to take their glasses off on a regular basis and wnats them to hang on their chest. It&#x27;s great for that. But only for that. I thought about cutting the strap and tieing it off to make it snug around the back of my head, but the way the ends mount on the glasses would make it too difficult to take off and put on again. If the postage would not have cost me almost as much as what I paid for it to begin with I would have returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;</li>
    <li> I liked the bin but from pictufrde of it thought i would get not just one bin but one ontop of another . now will have to order an ther to make it swork for me.</li>
    <li> These were not cheap, and it is a strange item to buy in the first place. These were a lot higher than ebay and junk store versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the design and execution of this version of the product made up for it, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, they were shipped in a reasonable amount of time and packaged well to prevent damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Amazon for items like this!</li>
    <li> For my glasses the usual retainers with elastic nooses simply didn&#x27;t work.  After a day or two the glasses always fell off and the elastic thingies had to be re-tightened.  Peeper-Keeper is great!  It solved the problem.  Very secure.  Slightly bulkier than the usual retainer but really grips tightly and hasn&#x27;t loosened at all after several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I put a knot in the middle of the string to shorten it, no problem.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the Peeper Keepers</li>
