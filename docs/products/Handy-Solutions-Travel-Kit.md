      <li>I bought this item to add to our emergency go-bag for my husband (if we have to leave our house suddenly we have everything we need for 3-4 days in one bag each) its the perfect size for an emergency bag.</li>
      <li>shaving cream razors everything a a man needs to clean up and more.</li>

      <li>It has pretty much all I need for quick out-of-town trips.</li>
      <li>good to have all these things together, but after buying this I found it at my local wallmart for less, probably not this exact kit by the same company but would have worked just the same, It fit nicely in the suitcase.</li>

      <li>I mainly wanted this for the case itself.</li>
      <li>I would highly recomend packing another razor though.</li>
      <li>Very convenient for short trips.</li>
      <li>I bought these travel kits for my two grandsons (ages 12 and 16) who visit frequently.  </li>
      <li>that I purchased for my 13-year old daughter.</li>
      <li>If all you need are the basics for a week-long business trip, vacation, or family camping excursion, though, this is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this kit for my 11-year old son.</li>
      <li>; I just want to make other buyers aware!</li>
      <li>I received the Men&#x27;s Travel Kit from the same company I ordered the Women&#x27;s Travel Kit and without going into too much detail, it&#x27;s the same situation....</li>
      <li>I did not receive what was pictured, but other reviewers made me aware that this could happen.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great little kit for travel. Comes exaclty as described. I would highly recomend packing another razor though.</li>
    <li> I was going to fly to NC and plan on going to CA soon and having this kit was a great help!&lt;br /&gt;The plastic bag is filled with hair gel (I left that out along with the shave kit and substitute for cologne and an electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it had sunscreen in it but whatever, I can add that too...</li>
    <li> I bought these travel kits for my two grandsons (ages 12 and 16) who visit frequently.  They also sleepover at friends homes quite often.  They were always forgetting their hygiene items.  With this kit, all they have to do is grab and go. Great products included.</li>
    <li> I received the Men&#x27;s Travel Kit from the same company I ordered the Women&#x27;s Travel Kit and without going into too much detail, it&#x27;s the same situation....advertisement is false 10pc when you only get 7 (8 counting bag) and not same products as shown.....</li>
    <li> Very convenient for short trips.</li>
    <li> Nice supplies.  I didn&#x27;t care for the Ladies version at all!</li>
    <li> Wish this was less expensive.</li>
    <li> You could call this little kit your \\&quot;starter\\&quot; kit. It&#x27;s got all the basics included in it, and it is cheap. If you are a infrequent traveler and just need a little something to take with you on those trips you take a few times a year, this is about perfect for you. If you travel all the time, you will probably want to get a more rugged and stylish travel kit. If all you need are the basics for a week-long business trip, vacation, or family camping excursion, though, this is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this kit for my 11-year old son. It made him feel pretty grown up to have his own little travel kit and he was excited to get it. There is a similar travel kit for women ([[ASIN:B0030HMRGA Handy Solutions Premium Women&#x27;s Travel Kit]]) that I purchased for my 13-year old daughter.</li>
    <li> The deodorant came all broken apart, the toothbrush was open and had deodorant all over it. Bag was ruined&lt;br /&gt; Guess I have 11$ shampoo and shaving cream and its not 10 pieces.?</li>
    <li> This was a perfect solution for a men&#x27;s gift for the homeless shelter.  It&#x27;s contained, easy to carry, and all the personal sized products were ready for use.  We are hoping the recipient fares better soon.</li>
    <li> good to have all these things together, but after buying this I found it at my local wallmart for less, probably not this exact kit by the same company but would have worked just the same, It fit nicely in the suitcase.</li>
    <li> way to expense of for what you get and all products in it are cheap! waste of money.</li>
    <li> Every product in this My husband would normally never use. I was in a pinch on time to head out of the country and needed to purchase this for my husband. If I had more time I would have spent the money on each item and still would have saved. Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> I am going on a 4 day trip this October. I was searching for a nice toiletry travel bag so it would be easy to pack and get through security. This bag has everything I need and conveniently in a package for security. Will fit in my carryon. Could not find something similar in stores.</li>
    <li> Nice little travel kit it contains everything that I needed for my vacation</li>
    <li> I mainly wanted this for the case itself. The products were a side benefit. I&#x27;d had a case like this that lasted for years and was perfect for dealing with TSA checkpoints. Unfortunately, there&#x27;s a paper lining at the bottom designed to advertise what the product is -- that &amp;#34;10pc Premium Men&#x27;s Travel Kit&amp;#34; part. That didn&#x27;t remove cleanly. I&#x27;ve got a case with all this sticky paper crud along the bottom sides.</li>
    <li> I bought this item to add to our emergency go-bag for my husband (if we have to leave our house suddenly we have everything we need for 3-4 days in one bag each) its the perfect size for an emergency bag. Arrived in good time and in good condition.</li>
    <li> Very good....thakn you, la entrega estuvo bien y el producto me gusto mucho, espero y tengan mas ofertas para comprar mas y mas...</li>
    <li> I did not receive what was pictured, but other reviewers made me aware that this could happen. That being said, it is still a travel case with men&#x27;s essentials. Including the bag it came in and the ziplock bag included, there were only 9 pieces. Again, not a big deal since I never could find a list of items included; I just want to make other buyers aware!</li>
    <li> This little kit has a few items that my hubby won&#x27;t use as he is bringing his electric shaver on our trip.  However, the space made by removing the un-useful items, is now filled with more appropriate items, such as body wash and moisturizing lotion  Yup...guys over 60 need a little moisturizing...just like the ladies!  This is a great, compact case, which will be perfect for taking with us to the beach for the showers that will follow.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband to use at the hospital when our son was born, it came in very handy.</li>
    <li> Gave one to each son for there trip to Europe.&lt;br /&gt;The perfect size and aproved by TSA.&lt;br /&gt;The razor has to come out of kit for carryon.</li>
    <li> used this for my recent trip and it did what it was made for. no complaints, everything came in good order with a little space to add a little more items.</li>
    <li> Price is right, all items are quality items, perfect for travel and for addition to all my families emergency car kits</li>
    <li> shaving cream razors everything a a man needs to clean up and more. AbReally great for the traveler who&#x27;s on the go all the time.</li>
    <li> Most of whats inside is crappy stuff, bad razor. I really dont know where is this 10 items!!! kept lookin, couldnt findmore than 7 or so..but, anyway, I dont recommend it at all</li>
    <li> Arrived just as pictured.  Real nice and handy.</li>
    <li> It has pretty much all I need for quick out-of-town trips. I haven&#x27;t had an opportunity to use it as of yet, but I am sure it will come in very handy.</li>
    <li> This is what the person wanted for travel.  He says it does the job.  Very happy that I found this for him.</li>
