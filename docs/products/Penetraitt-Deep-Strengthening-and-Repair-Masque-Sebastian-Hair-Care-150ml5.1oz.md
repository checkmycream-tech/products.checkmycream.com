    <li> Just good. This is not the profissional one.</li>
    <li> My fav repair masque ever. It works better in my hair (which is a hit oily) than Kerastase.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Having dry hair is a constant battle. There are a lot of products that don&#x27;t work. It has taken years of TLC to get my hair where I wanted it. I learned about Sebastian products from a friend. After just 2 uses of the deep strengthening &amp; repair masque, my hair is so soft and smells great. This product is a must for those that heat style very often! Love it!!</li>
    <li> Work great, my hair is more shiny and manageable.</li>
    <li> I just loved it! It arrived very fast! Thank you!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser (who happens to represent Sebastian in his spare time) recommended this product to me, claiming it was comparable to Kerastase options for a fraction of the price. Since he had given me the best combination of my life during another visit (a mix of some or all of [Kerastase Ciment Thermique + Kerastase Fibre Architecte + Kerastase Elixir Ultime + Sebastian Potion 9 Lite*] - I took a photo of the products) and the price difference, it seemed a risk worth trying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried the product in place of my conditioner, and another time after it (ie. shampoo, rinse, conditioner for a few minutes, rinse, this product for a few minutes) and honestly, couldn&#x27;t see a noticeable improvement either time. If anything, possibly the second time where I basically double conditioned, but without the lasting effects that my miracle combo above gave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the price, it didn&#x27;t hurt as an experiment, but I&#x27;ll be hunting down the real deal and making my hair feel like silk again, soon! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Edit - forgot \\&quot;Lite\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom she really likes it. It hydrates her hair and leaves it shinny plus it comes in a big bottle so it last a while.</li>
    <li> leaves hair soft and hydrated . I love</li>
    <li> Use this at least once a week on fine, wavy hair.  Hair feels soft, looks shiny, and the product does not weight my hair down.  Has a very pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Sebastian products are generally good and this was no different. It smooths the hair shaft and makes the hair feel moisturized while adding shine. I change conditioners regularly but I will always go back to this.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. Perfectly met my expectativa. This is THE BEST. Was simply an amazing experiente, because my hair was silky and disciplines.</li>
    <li> Very nice, i loved it.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair so soft</li>
    <li> I bought penetraitt to be delivered in my friend s houve,  who bring to Brazil for me, but she said, the mask was not delivered.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this product and she is satisfied with the results. ...  I will recommend to all my friends</li>
    <li> Does everything it says - great product!</li>
    <li> It works well for my hair, which is quite fine and frizzy, it gives some weight and a nice bounce.</li>
    <li> The greatest stuff EVER! My hair is super long and this stuff keeps it nice and healthy.</li>
    <li> I been using this product all my life n it&#x27;s very good for the hair and it&#x27;s future growth it&#x27;s great</li>
