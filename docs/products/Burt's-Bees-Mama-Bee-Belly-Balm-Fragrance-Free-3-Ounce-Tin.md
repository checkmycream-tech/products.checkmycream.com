      <li>However, there is an added benefit, I have a couple of post-surgery scars and it works great on them as well!</li>
      <li>This product is still AWESOME</li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome.  </li>
      <li>It helped minimize stretch marks GREATLY!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy too.</li>
      <li>If you like Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s products, then you already know how great the products are for baby.  </li>
      <li>this product along with Bio-Oil or good genes, but regardless -- no stretch marks and helped relieved my itchy belly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Bert&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s products and this is no exception.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It also feels good.  </li>
      <li>It takes a while to rub this all the places I want it, but it&#x27;s very nice and very light.</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!  </li>
      <li>Over 6 weeks using it, and love it!</li>
      <li>I loved it because it did not have an over powering smell &amp; it melted easily into the skin and felt good.  </li>
      <li>this is an amazing product, which I used during my 1st pregnancy and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is really nice.</li>
      <li>I contacted Neon &amp; Noble - Ships from UK</li>
      <li>I loved this balm while I was pregnant!  </li>
      <li>I loved this product when I was pregnant.</li>
      <li>The best part is that the products are natural and fragrance free.  </li>
      <li>If not, all I can tell you is that you will love this belly balm for Mama.  </li>
      <li>I simply love this product.</li>
      <li>This was my favorite and the one that I used the most.  </li>
      <li>Make sure when you use it, you don&#x27;t plan on wearing any restricting clothing or the balm gets all over it.</li>
      <li>Simply love it</li>
      <li>This balm is safe to use and I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>and so far it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>(and yes, there&#x27;s a huge difference).  </li>
      <li>and she confirmed what I thought, the balm was causing me to break out.</li>
      <li>You rub your fingers on the surface and it lightly coats them.</li>
      <li>, the ingredients are great, all-natural, and it is relatively affordable and lasts quite awhile.</li>
      <li>This balm did an excellent job of actually keeping my belly moistorized and really helped with the itching.  </li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find this seller (Neon &amp; Noble - Ships from UK) offering the balm and quickly ordered.  </li>
      <li>It also lasts for a long time (you won&#x27;t go through the 3 ounces as quickly) and has a pleasant fragrance.</li>
      <li>I started using it when I was 9 weeks pregnant.</li>
      <li>Since being pregnant, I have done a lot of research on anything that I put on my body and the Environmenal Working Group</li>
      <li>The other thing that I think is good about this product is that it is fragrance free, which is a must for the first three months, when you&#x27;re almost all the time dealing with morning sickness, you don&#x27;t need strong smells to make you feel sicker.</li>
      <li>I payed only 9.99 when they still made this but loved it so much that i had to have it with this pregnancy.  </li>
      <li>I tried this out for the first time when I was about 3 months pregnant in order to keep my skin resilient and as an attempt to avoid stretch marks.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m typing this review on my iPhone right now</li>
      <li>I got this item very fast via usps, three days before it&#x27;s estimated delivery</li>
      <li>It has hardly any smell at all, but I liked the light and fresh smell from before.  </li>
      <li>and I actually came here to Amazon to buy more ...</li>
      <li>It also is fragrance free and the ingredients are all natural</li>
      <li>I DID appreciate that it has no scent, as in my first trimester I could not stand the smell of anything.    </li>
      <li>However, I do get itchy on my tummy occasionally, so I got this because I love Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; products and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
      <li>I am 33 weeks now and have had no skin discomfort or stretch marks (although it seems that hereditary has more to do with stretch marks than what you actually put on your skin).  </li>
      <li>My friend who first gave it to me said she put it on 3 times a day and never had a stretch mark.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried using it right out of the shower, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to help much.  </li>
      <li>rated this product as having the safest score on their cosmetic database - this made me feel comfortable slathering it on both morning and night without the worrying about the risk of any funky chemicals being absorbed and potentially affecting our baby.  </li>
      <li>Overall, the Burt&#x27;s Bees Mama Bee Belly Balm feels really good on the skin and is a non-sticky way to keep your skin - especially during pregnancy - well-hydrated.  </li>
      <li>It could have been a bit less waxy, and more creamy, but maybe that&#x27;s what&#x27;s doing the trick!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the balm can get full credit since I didn&#x27;t gain very much weight with my pregnancy, but I will use again for sure.</li>
      <li>but I used it the whole 9 months and didn&#x27;t have 1 stretch mark.</li>
      <li>and it did absolutely NOTHING</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like the consistency</li>
      <li>and I was really scared that I will get them as well</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also pretty sticky--it did not leave my skin soft, but rather I could feel exactly where I had the balm and where I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m starting early :)</li>
      <li>At first, it was a little hard to get out of the can, but I figured out the best way to use it</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant smell and is only slightly greasy.</li>
      <li>The small is medicinal, but didn&#x27;t seem to bother me, overall, it&#x27;s a great product, but did not help me with the stretch marks.</li>
      <li>I started using this early in my pregnancy to comfort my tight skin while my tummy was growing and couldn&#x27;t recommend it more!  </li>
      <li>Also, the product before the change was more of a solid-like vaseline, which really melted well under your fingers and quenched that thirsty, tight belly skin.  </li>
      <li>My husband bought this for me after researching several products so that I could treat my skin while I am pregnant.</li>
      <li>that i&#x27;m pregnant with my 2nd baby</li>
      <li>When I was pregnant I tried several belly butters, lotions, stretch mark cream &amp; oils.  </li>
      <li>and I highly recommend</li>
      <li>I have tossed the tin and plan on looking for another product once my skin returns to normal.</li>
      <li>It is also worth the money, and lasted me the entire 9 months.  </li>
      <li>Although cream is a little pricey, definitely worth every penny because I did not even get 1 stretch mark!!</li>
      <li>I put it on a night, before bed, because it can get on clothing and, as I said, is very thick, but it was such a great relief while going through pregnancy.  </li>
      <li>you really have to work your fingers on it to get anything to actually rub on, but once you do, it works really well.</li>
      <li>So far, I like it!    </li>
      <li>I decided to try this product in my second trimester, i had used \\&quot;Basq\\&quot; belly butter for the first trimester</li>
      <li>It also made me itch more, which with oily skin made scratching that itch more difficult and gross.</li>
      <li>I never had problems with stretch marks throughout my first pregnancy, and now that I&#x27;m on my second</li>
      <li>The previous product, in my opinion, had a nicer smell where this product&#x27;s scent is ok but doesn&#x27;t necessarily smell &amp;#34;light and fresh&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>It makes my tummy so soft and the itchiness hasn&#x27;t bothered me since...</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have even one stretch marks so far.</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend it to women with itch belly&#x27;s, or itchy, dry skin anywhere really.</li>
      <li>I really like other products by Burt&#x27;s Bees, especially the baby line and of course the lip balm, so I was surprised not to like this very much.</li>
      <li>, I search high &amp; low for the belly BALM (not Butter) but found out it&#x27;s been discontinued.  </li>
      <li>and I actually like the feel of Burt&#x27;s better than the other, more expensive, brand.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this balm for a few weeks, and I&#x27;m only 14 weeks pregnant, so I can&#x27;t really say whether it&#x27;s helped to prevent stretch marks or not.  </li>
      <li>Being pregnant I cherish any little thing that is pleasurable or that makes me feel pampered, and putting this balm on just feels like another chore (in fact, this morning I just used regular old lotion).  </li>
      <li>This new product is more of a thick lotion, which didn&#x27;t seem to last as long as the last formula.  </li>
      <li>I used this cream everyday in the morning and at night and sometimes during the day if my tummy felt itchy and it made the itch go away right away.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a typical balm, very greasy and oily.</li>

<li> Enough of my lamenting about missing the old product.  </li>
<li> My skins feels soft, hydrated and firm.</li>
<li> as long as I remember to put this on every morning.  </li>
<li> Overall, it is not sticky (even for being oily), has minimal ingredients, and is virtually odorless.  </li>
<li> My skin often felt dry and itchy and this soothed it.</li>
<li> I was surprised with how thick the product is that it isn&#x27;t greasy and soaks into my skin without leaving residue on my clothes.</li>
<li> I am due in June 2011</li>
<li> But It might work for other expecting mommies.</li>
<li> Other than that</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have a family history of really bad stretch marks and I was really scared that I will get them as well but I did not even get 1 stretch mark. I used this cream everyday in the morning and at night and sometimes during the day if my tummy felt itchy and it made the itch go away right away. I also drank lots of water bc it is supposed to help keep your skin hydrated. Although cream is a little pricey, definitely worth every penny because I did not even get 1 stretch mark!! Yay!!</li>
    <li> No strong odor, and no rashing like with other products.  Don&#x27;t know about stretch marks yet, I&#x27;m only 7 months along and still have growing to do.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> I have never been one of those people who thought that some cream, ointment, or lotion could keep me from getting stretch marks, my mother had them, so I was convinced I would too - and I did.  This balm did an excellent job of actually keeping my belly moistorized and really helped with the itching.  When the itching got really bad for me, I just added a little cortizone to the balm and slathered it on.  The small is medicinal, but didn&#x27;t seem to bother me, overall, it&#x27;s a great product, but did not help me with the stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I was dying of itching and wanted something to help. One of my friends suggested the belly butter by BB, but it has been discontinued. I saw this and thought I would give a try. I&#x27;ve used half of the tin and it&#x27;s going in the trash. It&#x27;s a typical balm, very greasy and oily. Make sure when you use it, you don&#x27;t plan on wearing any restricting clothing or the balm gets all over it. I put it on at night because I wasn&#x27;t worried about getting my pajamas gross, but I wouldn&#x27;t consider doing it during the day. After a few days of using it, I noticed that I was breaking out with little zits and red bumps. I consulted with my OB/GYN to make sure nothing was wrong and she confirmed what I thought, the balm was causing me to break out. It also made me itch more, which with oily skin made scratching that itch more difficult and gross. I have tossed the tin and plan on looking for another product once my skin returns to normal.</li>
    <li> I never had problems with stretch marks throughout my first pregnancy, and now that I&#x27;m on my second I doubt I will this time either.  However, I do get itchy on my tummy occasionally, so I got this because I love Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; products and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I LOVE IT!  It makes my tummy so soft and the itchiness hasn&#x27;t bothered me since...as long as I remember to put this on every morning.  I&#x27;d buy it again and again and I highly recommend it to women with itch belly&#x27;s, or itchy, dry skin anywhere really.</li>
    <li> When I was pregnant I tried several belly butters, lotions, stretch mark cream &amp; oils.  This was my favorite and the one that I used the most.  I loved it because it did not have an over powering smell &amp; it melted easily into the skin and felt good.  I continue to use it even now when I am not pregnant.  No stretch marks with this baby either, so something must have worked!</li>
    <li> I loved this balm while I was pregnant!  It helped minimize stretch marks GREATLY!  It is very thick and feels like it is making a difference.  I put it on a night, before bed, because it can get on clothing and, as I said, is very thick, but it was such a great relief while going through pregnancy.  It is also worth the money, and lasted me the entire 9 months.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I found this a bit hard to use....you really have to work your fingers on it to get anything to actually rub on, but once you do, it works really well.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product in my second trimester, i had used \\&quot;Basq\\&quot; belly butter for the first trimester and it did absolutely NOTHING, i still got stretch marks all on my belly. The balm is quite hydrating i used it at night religiously after i showered. However, my stretch marks continued to grow &#x3D;[. I&#x27;m now convinced that my skin is just cursed, and no matter what I&#x27;m getting stretch marks. But It might work for other expecting mommies.</li>
    <li> I started using this early in my pregnancy to comfort my tight skin while my tummy was growing and couldn&#x27;t recommend it more!  Since being pregnant, I have done a lot of research on anything that I put on my body and the Environmenal Working Group rated this product as having the safest score on their cosmetic database - this made me feel comfortable slathering it on both morning and night without the worrying about the risk of any funky chemicals being absorbed and potentially affecting our baby.  I am 33 weeks now and have had no skin discomfort or stretch marks (although it seems that hereditary has more to do with stretch marks than what you actually put on your skin).  At first, it was a little hard to get out of the can, but I figured out the best way to use it is to just use the back of my fingernail to scoop some out, rub my hands together and apply in a circular motion.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have been using it for about a week at night on my boobs, belly and hips. I was surprised with how thick the product is that it isn&#x27;t greasy and soaks into my skin without leaving residue on my clothes. It also is fragrance free and the ingredients are all natural so you don&#x27;t have to worry about breaking out or getting a rash.  I will continue to use this product through my entire pregnancy and afterwards!</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for me after researching several products so that I could treat my skin while I am pregnant. However, there is an added benefit, I have a couple of post-surgery scars and it works great on them as well! This is not greasy at all, just put it on and give it a couple minutes to soak in before dressing. I have tried Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter and Mederma and neither of them work as well as Mama Bee Belly Balm. It also lasts for a long time (you won&#x27;t go through the 3 ounces as quickly) and has a pleasant fragrance. I am due in June 2011 and I will continue to use this well after my baby boy is born.</li>
    <li> Have had the belly balm for a few days now, but can already feel the itching on my 26 weeks belly subside. Use it as often as I feel like. It could have been a bit less waxy, and more creamy, but maybe that&#x27;s what&#x27;s doing the trick! So far, I like it!    UPDATE: Over 6 weeks using it, and love it! No stretch marks yet (am 32 weeks) and no itching.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend using this product because I firmly believe it is the reason I didn&#x27;t have stretch marks with both of my 8 1/2 pound babies.  However, they changed the smell and consistency from the product from 5 years ago.  The previous product, in my opinion, had a nicer smell where this product&#x27;s scent is ok but doesn&#x27;t necessarily smell &amp;#34;light and fresh&amp;#34;.  It has hardly any smell at all, but I liked the light and fresh smell from before.  Also, the product before the change was more of a solid-like vaseline, which really melted well under your fingers and quenched that thirsty, tight belly skin.  This new product is more of a thick lotion, which didn&#x27;t seem to last as long as the last formula.  Enough of my lamenting about missing the old product.  This product is still AWESOME and I highly recommend mama bee belly skin products.  However it can be found cheaper at Target.</li>
    <li> I simply love this product. I started using it when I was 9 weeks pregnant. I&#x27;m now 23 +5 days and I don&#x27;t have even one stretch marks so far. My skins feels soft, hydrated and firm. The other thing that I think is good about this product is that it is fragrance free, which is a must for the first three months, when you&#x27;re almost all the time dealing with morning sickness, you don&#x27;t need strong smells to make you feel sicker. Simply love it and I actually came here to Amazon to buy more ...</li>
    <li> This stuff is really nice. I&#x27;ve always loved Bert&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s products and this is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tin was much larger than I thought it was going to be for 3oz. The product is a solid and not a liquid, lotion or thick cream. It&#x27;s very similar in consistency to their hand salve. You rub your fingers on the surface and it lightly coats them. It takes a while to rub this all the places I want it, but it&#x27;s very nice and very light. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s greasy or oily.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even have to wash my hands after applying it. I just used it and I&#x27;m typing this review on my iPhone right now and it&#x27;s not all over my screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It keeps the skin on my belly moist for a while (which is what you want!) so I put it on before bed.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t smell it at all and so far it&#x27;s great. I just started using it this week. Hopefully, it will help prevent stretch marks during my pregnancy! I&#x27;m starting early :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this balm for a few weeks, and I&#x27;m only 14 weeks pregnant, so I can&#x27;t really say whether it&#x27;s helped to prevent stretch marks or not.  I don&#x27;t really like the consistency--it is very thick and difficult to spread over a large area.  I&#x27;ve tried using it right out of the shower, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to help much.  It&#x27;s also pretty sticky--it did not leave my skin soft, but rather I could feel exactly where I had the balm and where I didn&#x27;t.  I DID appreciate that it has no scent, as in my first trimester I could not stand the smell of anything.    I&#x27;m going to try something else.  Being pregnant I cherish any little thing that is pleasurable or that makes me feel pampered, and putting this balm on just feels like another chore (in fact, this morning I just used regular old lotion).  I really like other products by Burt&#x27;s Bees, especially the baby line and of course the lip balm, so I was surprised not to like this very much.</li>
    <li> Overall, the Burt&#x27;s Bees Mama Bee Belly Balm feels really good on the skin and is a non-sticky way to keep your skin - especially during pregnancy - well-hydrated.  I tried this out for the first time when I was about 3 months pregnant in order to keep my skin resilient and as an attempt to avoid stretch marks.  I switched to another brand just for comparison but found it to be rather sticky.  I recently switched back to the Burt&#x27;s Bees balm and I actually like the feel of Burt&#x27;s better than the other, more expensive, brand.  Overall, it is not sticky (even for being oily), has minimal ingredients, and is virtually odorless.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I wish it had the cocoa butter... which is supposed to help \\&quot;prevent\\&quot; stretch marks.  Other than that, the ingredients are great, all-natural, and it is relatively affordable and lasts quite awhile.</li>
    <li> I got this item very fast via usps, three days before it&#x27;s estimated delivery date.&lt;br /&gt;The ointment is moisturizing, without scents!  I always get mosquito bites when I put scented skin care products on. With this mama bee belly balm this problem&#x27;s gone. (Also recommend Aveeno products, no scents)</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  Plan and simple. It does work as stated.  We used this everyday and she could not be happier no stretch marks.  I&#x27;m happy too.</li>
    <li> If you like Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s products, then you already know how great the products are for baby.  If not, all I can tell you is that you will love this belly balm for Mama.  It is soothing and works well before and after baby arrives.  It also feels good.  I use on belly, legs, thighs, arms, wherever I need.  The best part is that the products are natural and fragrance free.  So, you do not have to feel bad about using this before or after your baby comes.  This product is a must-have for Mama!</li>
    <li> I use this one for hands and it does a difference. This balm is safe to use and I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> I loved this product when I was pregnant. I greased my belly every night with Mama Bee. I could tell if I forgot because the itchy skin returned. This balm definately relieved the uncomfortable stretch and itch sensation from my expanding belly. My friend who first gave it to me said she put it on 3 times a day and never had a stretch mark. I put it on every night and I also do not have any stretch marks. I&#x27;m not sure if the balm can get full credit since I didn&#x27;t gain very much weight with my pregnancy, but I will use again for sure.</li>
    <li> this is an amazing product, which I used during my 1st pregnancy and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks.  Not sure if it&#x27;s from the slow weight gain, this product along with Bio-Oil or good genes, but regardless -- no stretch marks and helped relieved my itchy belly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now that i&#x27;m pregnant with my 2nd baby, I search high &amp; low for the belly BALM (not Butter) but found out it&#x27;s been discontinued.  I was pleasantly surprised to find this seller (Neon &amp; Noble - Ships from UK) offering the balm and quickly ordered.  Well, they sent me the WRONG ITEM (from the UK no less) -- they sent the Belly Butter, not Balm.  (and yes, there&#x27;s a huge difference).  I contacted Neon &amp; Noble - Ships from UK and they sent me a return label -- but I have to pay the shipping costs!!! I basically have to pay for the error THEY made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ugh, don&#x27;t order from this company. False advertising!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t even do a review on the seller, very annoying.</li>
    <li> So sad that they do not make this anymore.  I payed only 9.99 when they still made this but loved it so much that i had to have it with this pregnancy.  I gained 40lbs and I&#x27;m only 5&#x27; 1&#x27;&#x27; I used tons of this product and i never had one stretch mark.  i tired other products but nothing is like this and nothing is this thick and i think that&#x27;s the key to this product.  Burt&#x27;s Bees PLEASE BRING THIS BACK!!!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was this balm or my skin but I used it the whole 9 months and didn&#x27;t have 1 stretch mark. My skin often felt dry and itchy and this soothed it. I used it morning and night. It has a pleasant smell and is only slightly greasy. I&#x27;d just rub the excess into my hands!</li>
