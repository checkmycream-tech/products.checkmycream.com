      <li>I cant not tell u how much I love this product I hope they never stop making it after coloring my hair last week</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my first bottle of Split Remedy from my mother in law.</li>
      <li>This split end remedy does exactly what it says.  </li>
      <li>But if you follow the directions it gives in the back, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll not regret your purchase as I didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>You won&#x27;t regret it, and I&#x27;m positive you will be hooked on it.</li>
      <li>Add a bit in after towel drying your hair; you can also add more (sparingly) after your hair is dry to make your hair non-frizzy.</li>
      <li>This product left my hair smooth and reduced the fray from my split ends.</li>
      <li>no longer embarrassed of my hair thank you so much.</li>
      <li>This product seems to really help with both issues.</li>
      <li>so much that I have been buying it for myself ever since -</li>
      <li>Be sure you apply it when your hair is still wet.</li>
      <li>I think it compares with Giovanni Direct Leave-In Conditioner, although the latter leaves more curl in the hair.</li>
      <li>Long, fine, wavy hair that reaches 5 inches from my waistband.</li>
      <li>I tried so many different products to bring my hair back to life and nothing worked.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After sleeping on it, my hair seems to have tons of volume - so much that it almost looks like I just got a professional</li>
      <li>The only time ive experienced the heavy/weighed down feeling that other reviewers describe is when ive used too much.</li>
      <li>I rarely use heat on my hair and let air dry</li>
      <li>Pretty good on shine, which, with body, usually suffers with anti-frizz products.</li>
      <li>It will leave your once brittle hair soft and</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally curly</li>
      <li>wow what a difference it made my hair .</li>
      <li>Works well, makes my hair soft and my split ends have reduced.</li>
      <li>After using different hot tools, my hair is prone to split ends, but since using this product, I barely have them</li>
      <li>I actually think this did give me the appearance of less split ends, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s full of silicone and just glues them together!</li>
      <li>I straighten my hair using a flat iron spray, then after that I rub this in the palms of my hand and smooth it down my hair especially on the ends.</li>
      <li>Not only Did it help my split damaged ends it left my hair so silky and soft!</li>
      <li>I like this product because I live in a dry climate area and it keep my hair end moisturized</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty dry in the morning with no real change to the moisture in my hair.</li>
      <li>Would recommend to ladys who live in a dry climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
      <li>My hair feels much smoother and less frizz since I started to use it.</li>
      <li>so.. only for the first few hours</li>
      <li>This definitely helped during the cold, dry winter months during which I used this daily (and will still continue to do so until I’ve finished the bottle), but I feel there may be something out there also at a reasonable price which might do it better.</li>
      <li>It smells fine and works to cut down on frizz, but it dulls down hair.</li>

<li> My thick and lush  african hair can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
<li> recently cut my once long hair short in september</li>
<li> After bleaching my hair to go blonde my hair was left so dry</li>
<li> She always gives me little things like this, and I usually do not get around to testing them out, but I ran out of mousse one day and used this instead.&lt;br</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t get my hair cut that often and blow dry it daily</li>
<li> I love this product please continue to make this saved me from cutting my hair again .i</li>
<li> Using a professional straightener did not even tame the frizz</li>
<li> I had results similar to other reviewers when I didn&#x27;t follow the directions on the bottle.</li>
<li> I keep trying other brands but keep coming back to this.</li>
<li> If you have dry and frizzy hair due to constant coloring.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t work for me even with the blow dry: the brush got sticked on my hair with it and difficulted the brushing.</li>
<li> My hair has been really dry and lots of split ends since my son was born.</li>
<li> not so dry.</li>
<li> so it starts looking dry and fly-away.  </li>
<li> I use a generous amount (a mound the circumference of a quarter) and massage into my towel dried hair (on the last 12 inches or so only)</li>
<li> and it left my hair feeling coated and weighed down.  </li>
<li> I have hair down to my derriere, and I get by on only 3-4 pumps of Split Remedy on any day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> U only need a little bit cause it goes a long way.</li>
<li> It is not very sticky and not oily.</li>
<li> With that being said, a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> but I still want to try other products to compare.</li>
<li> It smoothed out the rough ends and did not weigh my hair down.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> A bit thick, sticky on hands.  Aside from that if you use sparingly it does improve the look of my hair.</li>
    <li> It smells fine and works to cut down on frizz, but it dulls down hair.</li>
    <li> Works well, makes my hair soft and my split ends have reduced.</li>
    <li> I use this product on both wet and dry hair with wonderful results in detangling, conditioning and taming my frizzies. The best thing about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t make my fine wavy hair greasy. It seems to seal the cuticle temporarily providing great shine and a surprising boost of body. For frizzies however, you may have to reapply after a 3-4 hours.</li>
    <li> Best product for Split ends and keeping your hair smooth and static free.... LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This was a waste of money.  This product did not help my split ends at all and it left my hair feeling coated and weighed down.  Another failed product that ends up in the garbage can *sigh*.</li>
    <li> I like to use this product because it does not weigh my hair down or look greasy.  It helps reduce the &amp;#34;fly away&amp;#34; hairs caused by static build-up as well.</li>
    <li> I wish I had been more hair smart before, but I guess everyone has to start somewhere. I actually think this did give me the appearance of less split ends, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s full of silicone and just glues them together! The only things that reduce split ends are regular trims and treating your hair well. There&#x27;s nothing that can fix them once they&#x27;re there. If you like &#x27;cones, give it a try. Just know that it&#x27;s an illusion. As soon as I stop using any kind of &#x27;cone, the splits showed up again and I just had to trim them off.</li>
    <li> The leave in conditioner serum was nice, but I knew I could find something with better results. Didn&#x27;t do enough for me to keep, so returned it.</li>
    <li> This was the worst hair product I have ever used. It made my hair feel greasy and dirty at the scalp and totally dried out and frizzy at the ends. Using a professional straightener did not even tame the frizz this product left behind. Does nothing to detangle either.</li>
    <li> I have relaxed hair. I apply this after i wash my hair, I lay it down for the night and then comb it out in the morning. It&#x27;s pretty dry in the morning with no real change to the moisture in my hair.</li>
    <li> This is an inexpensive leave-in that is light and works great to calm my curls and prevent fly-aways and frizz!</li>
    <li> I like this product because I live in a dry climate area and it keep my hair end moisturized&lt;br /&gt;and not so dry. Would recommend to ladys who live in a dry climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> My hair has been really dry and lots of split ends since my son was born. This product seems to really help with both issues.</li>
    <li> I have short color damaged split end hair. I&#x27;ve used this product after every shower for about 6 months now. I just put it on the brittle flyaway ends. It seems to make my hair very greasy in a few hours and frizzy looking still.. so.. only for the first few hours im okay..</li>
    <li> I bought this not a long time ago and since the first time I used, I noticed how smooth my hair became and my split ends were visibly better. Of course none of hair products you buy, work by themselves. But if you follow the directions it gives in the back, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll not regret your purchase as I didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I love it, it makes my hair so soft and smells really great. My thick and lush  african hair can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I keep trying other brands but keep coming back to this. The only time ive experienced the heavy/weighed down feeling that other reviewers describe is when ive used too much. I have shoulder length thin-medium hair, and use 1.5 pumps.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! And the scent is marvelous!!!</li>
    <li> My hair feels like it is made of silk after using this product for a week! I love it and highly recommend it! My hair is naturally curly so I have a lot of split ends, not anymore!</li>
    <li> Does an excellent job of smoothing hair. Pretty good on shine, which, with body, usually suffers with anti-frizz products. I think it compares with Giovanni Direct Leave-In Conditioner, although the latter leaves more curl in the hair. Tresemme does a bit better on the split ends though.</li>
    <li> I straighten my hair using a flat iron spray, then after that I rub this in the palms of my hand and smooth it down my hair especially on the ends. I then take the hairdryer and comb through it while drying for a second. I think it works great!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely manner and packaged well. This product is awesome if you have dry/frizzy/curly hair. Add a bit in after towel drying your hair; you can also add more (sparingly) after your hair is dry to make your hair non-frizzy. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair looking oily or crunchy. Great product!</li>
    <li> Long, fine, wavy hair that reaches 5 inches from my waistband. I rarely use heat on my hair and let air dry normally so it is not in bad shape. I found Kiehl’s Argan oil oddly drying and have experimented with a bunch of other serum types of conditioning treatments. This is the first leave-in of this kind that I’ve tried. It’s ok. I use a generous amount (a mound the circumference of a quarter) and massage into my towel dried hair (on the last 12 inches or so only) just minutes after I get out of the shower. I do this after I’ve sprayed in Nexus leave in spray conditioner. It is lightweight and has no discernable fragrance, is not sticky and does not do anything weird to your hair. It does provide added moisture but I still want to try other products to compare. This definitely helped during the cold, dry winter months during which I used this daily (and will still continue to do so until I’ve finished the bottle), but I feel there may be something out there also at a reasonable price which might do it better. Not committed but I would probably repurchase if I found a good deal again.</li>
    <li> great leave in conditioner</li>
    <li> I cant not tell u how much I love this product I hope they never stop making it after coloring my hair last week it fried My hair was so fried couldnt style it  fix it or anything it was brittle look like straw looked horrible all I did was cry after looking at reviews I bought this last night and used it today wow what a difference it made my hair . Its looks alot better then what it did fried i could actually style and fix my once fried straw hair made it a bit stronger too. U only need a little bit cause it goes a long way. I love this product please continue to make this saved me from cutting my hair again .i recently cut my once long hair short in september and I thought for sure I would need another cut since I fried my straw hair but this product saved my hair and my life no longer embarrassed of my hair thank you so much.</li>
    <li> I love the smell, but honestly, it does nothing for your hair.</li>
    <li> I love it. My hair feels much smoother and less frizz since I started to use it. It is not very sticky and not oily.</li>
    <li> This product is the best leave-in conditioner. After 3 days of using this product my hair felt silky and smooth. its also great for relaxed hair or treated hair.</li>
    <li> I love volume so this is not for me. I makes my hair heavy and like greasy. I didn&#x27;t work for me even with the blow dry: the brush got sticked on my hair with it and difficulted the brushing.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but I had to for this! After bleaching my hair to go blonde my hair was left so dry and my ends were awful! I tried so many different products to bring my hair back to life and nothing worked. My sister recommended this product to me and I literally felt the difference in my hair after one use. Not only Did it help my split damaged ends it left my hair so silky and soft! It works and for the price it&#x27;s so worth a try.</li>
    <li> This product left my hair smooth and reduced the fray from my split ends. I loved the way it nourished my hair extra. Be sure you apply it when your hair is still wet. I had results similar to other reviewers when I didn&#x27;t follow the directions on the bottle. But when directions were followed, my hair was lovely and workable.</li>
    <li> If you have dry and frizzy hair due to constant coloring. YOU MUST get this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU HAVE TO APPLY IT WHEN YOU HAIR IS DAMP!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Place a dime size amount on your hair when damp and watch the transformation happen when you style it.  It will leave your once brittle hair soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLUS it smells like heaven!</li>
    <li> leave in conditioner works great for damaged or dried hair , which is my hair i just bleached the bottom so i am in need of using leave in conditioner it helps</li>
    <li> Okay,&lt;br /&gt;I have to rave about this product because I absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;I put this in my hair right out of the shower and my hair feels like pure silk throughout the day. Even my bed head doesn&#x27;t get too crazy the next morning, and I&#x27;m usually one of wavy, thick, frizzy haired girls who&#x27;s hair is nearly impossible to deal with after sleeping on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my first bottle of Split Remedy from my mother in law. She always gives me little things like this, and I usually do not get around to testing them out, but I ran out of mousse one day and used this instead.&lt;br /&gt;It gave me all day control over frizz and roughness, so much that I have been buying it for myself ever since - and that was 7 months ago!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have honestly seen nearly 75% of my split ends disappear. After using different hot tools, my hair is prone to split ends, but since using this product, I barely have them anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is thicker than a serum, but thinner than a conditioner. With that being said, a little goes a long way. I have hair down to my derriere, and I get by on only 3-4 pumps of Split Remedy on any day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After sleeping on it, my hair seems to have tons of volume - so much that it almost looks like I just got a professional blowout!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just do yourself this favor and try this product ONCE. You won&#x27;t regret it, and I&#x27;m positive you will be hooked on it.</li>
    <li> This split end remedy does exactly what it says.  I don&#x27;t get my hair cut that often and blow dry it daily so it starts looking dry and fly-away.  Buying the two pack on Amazon Prime is cheaper than buying it at the store and it&#x27;s delivered right to the door.  This product DOES what it says, and you don&#x27;t have to rinse it out.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This product worked well. It smoothed out the rough ends and did not weigh my hair down. Great buy with the coupon.</li>
