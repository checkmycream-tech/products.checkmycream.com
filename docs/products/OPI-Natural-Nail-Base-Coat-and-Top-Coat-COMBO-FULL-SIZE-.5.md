      <li>I love these</li>
      <li>I just end up using the pedicure&#x27;s top coat for shine because is actually lasts two weeks &amp; sometime more!!!!</li>
      <li>Always a love product, no questions asked</li>
      <li>Works better than opi&#x27;s base/top coat in one.</li>
      <li>Would not recommend top coat.  </li>
      <li>Perfect - as expected.</li>
      <li>They are as advertised, they are both easy to apply and work well</li>
      <li>BEST QUALITY BASE AND TOP COAT ON THE MARKET!!!!</li>
      <li>But aside from that, worth the buy for the package of two!</li>
      <li>goes on smooth and dries quickly</li>
      <li>top coat has beautiful hard shine.</li>
      <li>My toes are full looking in a matter of days.</li>
      <li>The top coat dries really tacky.</li>
      <li>Thickened too quickly, rendering it unusable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used them together now a few times on my toes and my polish never chips and stays as beautiful and glossy as the day it was applied.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and dries very fast.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Totally worth the purchase.</li>

      <li>Love, love these base &amp; top coats!!</li>
      <li>This base coat and top coat the best ever..</li>
      <li>fast shipment product exactly as shown</li>
      <li>VERY good base and top coat combo</li>
      <li>It even makes the cheap nail polish last longer.</li>
      <li>package came fast.</li>
      <li>my nails are much healthier.</li>
      <li>however I think Essie has a slightly shinier top coat.</li>
      <li>It also came in a cute little package.</li>
      <li>They go on smoothly with the help of OPI&#x27;s wide brush and if you wait about 4 minutes between each coat of color in manicure..</li>
      <li>They were also quick to send me a replacement bottle of the top coat when it arrived broken in the mail.</li>
      <li>Try a quick dry one, that&#x27;s what I did.</li>
      <li>using this with funny bunny for a natural looking American tip</li>
      <li>This base coat/top coat combo is awesome!</li>
      <li>Top cost made my nail application thick and gloppy.  </li>
      <li>I was really glad to find the O.P.I base coat and top coat in a set of two like this.  </li>
      <li>May last a little longer than some others, but still comes off fingernail tips easily after only a few hand washings  or doing dishes.</li>
