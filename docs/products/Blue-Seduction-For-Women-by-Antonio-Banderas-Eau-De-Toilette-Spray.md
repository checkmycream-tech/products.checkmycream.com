    <li> Great, the best undoubtedly brought everything indicated by the publication, is great quality, has exceeded my expectations. Great buy. From Venezuela recommend</li>
    <li> excelente perfume ...</li>
    <li> Already purchased this fragrance of my smelled much better than this so I doubt that this is the original</li>
    <li> This item was shipped quickly and undamaged.  It&#x27;s exactly what my wife wanted!!  I would use this shipper any time.</li>
    <li> My mom loved this perfume. It&#x27;s more of a mature scent and aquatic. I like that. Not for everyone though.</li>
    <li> If you are a woman and like the men&#x27;s Cool Water, you may likely find this a match. It is refreshing, spicey, earthy maybe some bergamot and citrus...all I know is that since I have been wearing Blue Seduction, once I run out, there I am ordering another bottle!</li>
    <li> I love the men&#x27;s version of this cologne (which I bought for my husband).  I was expecting/hoping the women&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;version would be similar.  But buying a fragrance without smelling it in person first is not a good idea.  This is&lt;br /&gt;spicy and sexy - I prefer soft and romantic myself.  If I&#x27;m in the mood to be a little flashy I will use this.  It&#x27;s a scent&lt;br /&gt;to get you noticed (warm, sweet, with a peppery under note).</li>
