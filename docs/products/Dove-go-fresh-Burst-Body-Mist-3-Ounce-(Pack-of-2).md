      <li>It does smell like the soap, but waaaaay too strong.</li>
      <li>I decided to try it because my two favorite Dove Go Fresh scents weren&#x27;t available.</li>

      <li>ive been using this scent for a while now and cant find it too much in stores...found it in a two pack and bigger than what was found in stores...</li>
      <li>I personally didn&#x27;t like this particular scent.  </li>
      <li>I have not had any in quite some time since it is apparently off the market.  </li>

    <li> I was so pleased to find this body mist again at such an extremely reasonable price.  This fragrance is extremely difficult to find.  Of all the fragrances Dove has marketed this is my favorite body mist of all time.  It is such a lovely fragrance I want to always have some on hand.  I have not had any in quite some time since it is apparently off the market.  It seems every time a fragrance I like and can wear without it affecting my respiratory issues is made available, it is taken off the market soon after and that irritates me.  So if Dove can stick with a fragrance I like, this is the one to stick with.  I am a fan for life of this lovely scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other products that contain ginger seem over powering and attack my respiratory system.  Dove go fresh Burst Body Mist-nectarine and white ginger scent is a perfect mix of ingredients that make the most of each without drowning out the other.  The scent fades to a lovely light refreshing summery fragrance that lasts and lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely happy with this item and wish it could be made more readily available to consumers at such a reasonable price.  With free shipping, either by the seller or for Amazon Prime members, buyers can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
    <li> I personally didn&#x27;t like this particular scent.  It was too sweet and fruity for me.  I decided to try it because my two favorite Dove Go Fresh scents weren&#x27;t available.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine, but not quite as good as the original citrus.  And, of course more expensive</li>
    <li> love the product. arrived quickly. great price. i highly recommend this product from this company. i will reorder if available.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this after shower spray for about a year now and it smells great. Some people have said I smell like cinnamon but it&#x27;s this product after it&#x27;s been on a while. I love the Burst bath soap so this just makes the lovely scent last a little longer.</li>
    <li> My local grocery has stopped selling this staple of my life but shopping on Amazon is easier than going to the store.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to be able to find my favorite Dove Body Mist. This is a lightly scented mist that is just right for every day wear. It is refreshing and sends a beautiful fragrance to everyone you encounter during your day. I don&#x27;t leave home without it!</li>
    <li> I can no longer find this product in stores so I bought it on line.  I love this scent.  I pair it with the body wash.</li>
    <li> Love it.. Its one of my favorite scents</li>
    <li> Love this product!! Can&#x27;t find it in stores anmore</li>
    <li> Light and fresh scent! Smells really nice, I use this as my main fragrance as opposed to my other perfumes. I have received many compliments on this scent. I will purchase more once I complete my last bottle, for some reason I cannot locate this at my local stores.</li>
    <li> nice scent and can&#x27;t find this body spray locally.  thanks</li>
    <li> Purchased this item for my daughter. She loves the Dove Body Mist sprays.</li>
    <li> It smells fresh and lingers on your skin. I love this product. I wish I could find a good deal on the body wash as well.</li>
    <li> The item was not as appears - it was the new packaging and has a slight variation in scent.  Really wanted original.</li>

    <li> ive been using this scent for a while now and cant find it too much in stores...found it in a two pack and bigger than what was found in stores...very happy and definately would recommend</li>
    <li> It does smell like the soap, but waaaaay too strong. I can&#x27;t put it on without smelling like I loaded up on cheap perfume.</li>
    <li> For many years I wore pricey Eau de Parfums such as \\&quot;Shalimar\\&quot;, \\&quot;Arpege\\&quot;, \\&quot;Donna Karan\\&quot; and \\&quot;Chanel&#x27;s Allure\\&quot;, that is until I discovered the \\&quot;Dove Body Mists\\&quot;. There are several fragrances available from Dove, but, \\&quot;Nectarine and White Ginger Scent\\&quot; is my favorite...&lt;br /&gt;Have found AMAZON to be the BEST Source for finding products that have been on the market a while, and become rather scarce on store shelves...the \\&quot;Dove Body Mist\\&quot; is a perfect example. Much as I enjoyed the costly Eau de Parfums, I resented having to use them so sparingly. I keep a bottle of \\&quot;Dove Body Mist\\&quot; on my dressing room counter, one in my purse, and another in the console of my car...and I spray, spray, spray whenever I want to! If you find another of the \\&quot;Dove Body Mists\\&quot; you prefer, Please let me know! Blessings to You!</li>
    <li> I purchased this because it is my favorite Dove scent and it was discontinued. It was wrapped in the original packaging and was like new. I am so glad I ordered this! I keep one in my gym bag, car, and at home.</li>
    <li> Love these light fragrences from Dove, so happy to finally find somewhere to order them since our local Wal-Mart no longer stocks them.  Thanks for the prompt service and the affordable price.</li>
    <li> I like all of Dove&#x27;s body mist products.  It nice to spray on you right after you get out of the shower.  Very refreshing.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mother. She loves it and uses it every day.</li>
    <li> So glad that amazon sells this love it will be ordering more</li>
    <li> Awsome, came before expected date</li>
    <li> This is the best body mist I have ever used! Perfect for every day use. Cost friendly, skin friendly (for those with sensitive skin like myself), crisp clean smell, and not too heavy. Will be ordering more! :) Just another reason I love Dove. ♡</li>
    <li> Love the fresh and fruity scent.  Very clean and crisp!</li>
