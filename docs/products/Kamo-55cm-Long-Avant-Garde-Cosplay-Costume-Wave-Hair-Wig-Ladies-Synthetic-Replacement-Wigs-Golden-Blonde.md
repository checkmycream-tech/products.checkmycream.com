      <li>It is easy to put on and take off.  </li>
      <li>Nice quality mannequin wig--it maintains its shape very well!  </li>
      <li>so... I hope whoever buys this also finds this wig very worth it.</li>
      <li>Very sarifiedcrhe curls hold great and don&#x27;t tangle so far.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for daily wear, but it&#x27;s good for a change, spicing things up or for a costume.</li>
      <li>True to the color and style in the photo.</li>
      <li>The item arrived promptly and was of good quality as described but instead of the blonde</li>
      <li>Its a very nice wig, only on the first day you wear it.</li>
      <li>The hair is thick, it doesn&#x27;t show through to the tracks and the bangs are perfect for making the hairline more realistic.  </li>
      <li>I love the highlights and low lights of it. :)</li>
      <li>I got my product  quick</li>
      <li>It might have been good for a different sort of costume, but wasn&#x27;t at all right for my purposes.  </li>
      <li>The curls look realistic and the color shading is pretty and unique.  </li>
      <li>feels real and is very pretty;</li>
      <li>It is pretty</li>
      <li>I always buy this exact wig.</li>
      <li>Idk if I look good as a blonde but for those of you that definitely do get it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great as an everyday wig, doesn&#x27;t tangle easily and brushes out well with very minimal hair loss.</li>
      <li>It looks nothing like the picture, the ends get nappy fast (like the first couple days).</li>
      <li>Love it, exactly what I expected</li>
      <li>The blonde is a bit chunky and the bangs are a bit long, but other than that, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
      <li>I am not used to long hair and this wig is comfortable and not to hot.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this wig!</li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>I wore this wig for halloween and everyone thought it was my real hair.</li>
      <li>Looks and feels real.</li>
      <li>I love this wig very much I wear it almost everyday..</li>
      <li>I will warn, however, that the high lights are chunky towards part as seen in the picture.</li>
      <li>but I was pleasantly surprised!!</li>
      <li>depends where u live im in massachusetts</li>
      <li>The highlights are very dramatic, but  I am happy with it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like looks like old</li>
      <li>It looks and feels natural.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so soft.</li>
      <li>Kind of on the thin side,</li>
      <li>The highlighting is gorgeous, not to chunky that it looks fake.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive wig with which to have a little fun!</li>
      <li>Still worth buying, just handle it carefully!</li>
      <li>The highlights aren&#x27;t blended very well &amp; the hair is a bit thin, but then again it&#x27;s a cheap wig.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that there were no instructions on how to adjust the fit.  </li>
      <li>i have bought it multiple times and i like them minus how quicy they go south and how much of the hair falls out.</li>
      <li>but I will shorten it as I am too old for long ones</li>
      <li>, it tangles so quickly, and a track is already hanging off on one side, half empty.  </li>

<li> , it tangles so quickly, and a track is already hanging off on one side, half empty.  </li>
<li> On me, the wig is very long, to the small of my back (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;4&amp;#34;).  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s such a pretty wig though, but at such a cheap price I&#x27;m not too disappointed.  </li>
<li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the bangs look grey</li>
<li> I expected the wig actually looked like gray hair with white streaks.  </li>
<li> I did trim the bangs, because they were a bit long.</li>
<li> I like it but the coloring is not as pictured; bangs are a different color and the highlights are extremely chunky.</li>
<li> Yes bangs are a little long and the bang color is off some but enough to bother me.</li>
<li> The hair got a little ratty though the night but can be easily brushed out.</li>
<li> A little too big for me.  </li>
<li> Very thick, looks like real hair, has adjustable straps.  </li>
<li> The hair sheds like crazy if you even try to lightly brush it (with a wig brush)</li>
<li> Be careful do not click one day shipping</li>
<li> I was hesitant due to the price</li>
<li> My only complaint is that it sheds a little, but that is to expected.  </li>
<li> Not worth it</li>
<li> it looks very realistic now after  the curls I found were a little too fake looking</li>

    <li> very cute costume wig</li>
    <li> This wig is excellent and well worth the price.  Very thick, looks like real hair, has adjustable straps.  I would highly recommend this wig!</li>
    <li> Very long and beautiful wig! It&#x27;s perfect for a Halloween costume!</li>
    <li> It looks so fake trust me</li>
    <li> Love it, exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like looks like old</li>
    <li> Nothing is wrong w product. I just don&#x27;t like what it looks like on me</li>
    <li> Love it got so many compliments if your thinking of getting it get it it arrived in time two day shipping</li>
    <li> It is pretty but I will shorten it as I am too old for long ones</li>
    <li> Beautiful appearance, natural.. I trimmed with no problems.</li>
    <li> Bangs not cut even and some hair fell out while trying it on.</li>
    <li> feels real and is very pretty; bangs are NOT the same color!!!</li>
    <li> I always buy this exact wig. i have bought it multiple times and i like them minus how quicy they go south and how much of the hair falls out. but upon receipt of the last two i bought together....i noticed they were disasters. the hair was a tangled mess and one even looked as if it had been opened and something spilled on it. i needed them and tried to cleab them up...but it was of no use. so disappointed :(</li>
    <li> I got my product  quick and it was great</li>
    <li> This is a gorgeous wig! The hair is thick, it doesn&#x27;t show through to the tracks and the bangs are perfect for making the hairline more realistic.  On me, the wig is very long, to the small of my back (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;4&amp;#34;).  It also is a bit darker than it appears in the photo, which is actually and improvement.  The highlighting is gorgeous, not to chunky that it looks fake. I can&#x27;t believe I only paid $15 for it! I have worn wigs before, and this is as good of quality as the ones I pay about $80 for.  I have a larger head, and it fits me well.  My only complaint is that it sheds a little, but that is to expected.  The hair is soft and silky, I&#x27;m just so happy with this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I had to come back and take a star off because I have worn the wig three times, and it&#x27;s already falling apart.  The hair sheds like crazy if you even try to lightly brush it (with a wig brush), it tangles so quickly, and a track is already hanging off on one side, half empty.  It&#x27;s such a pretty wig though, but at such a cheap price I&#x27;m not too disappointed.  Still worth buying, just handle it carefully!</li>
    <li> Its a very nice wig, only on the first day you wear it. haha</li>
    <li> Love this wig! The blonde is a bit chunky and the bangs are a bit long, but other than that, it&#x27;s perfect. I was hesitant due to the price but I was pleasantly surprised!!

    <li> Very sarifiedcrhe curls hold great and don&#x27;t tangle so far. Yes bangs are a little long and the bang color is off some but enough to bother me. For 16.99 I&#x27;m very happy. I would have gave it 5 stars if it was thicker</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the best looking wig I&#x27;ve bought, but you can&#x27;t beat it for the price! The highlights aren&#x27;t blended very well &amp; the hair is a bit thin, but then again it&#x27;s a cheap wig. It fits well and the hair has a good feel to it. It is much better than the wigs in the party stores that would be 2-3 times the price of this one. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for daily wear, but it&#x27;s good for a change, spicing things up or for a costume.</li>
    <li> Everything happened as advertised - I will be a returning customer for sure.</li>
    <li> Worst wig I have ever!!!!! It looks nothing like the picture, the ends get nappy fast (like the first couple days). I have never been so disappointed, and I will never buy this again.</li>
    <li> Looked great but was super itchy.</li>
    <li> Styles well, heat resistant and washable. The bangs are a different shade of ash blonde from the rest of the hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great wig for the price. The color is nice, the bangs are cut well and its a light wight wig. I will warn, however, that the high lights are chunky towards part as seen in the picture. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for everyday use for I feel it would tangle and shed a lot. Aside from that, I would recommend for cosplaying and sparse use.</li>
    <li> The wig is OK.  A little too big for me.  But OK.  It was for Halloween.</li>
    <li> I like it but the coloring is not as pictured; bangs are a different color and the highlights are extremely chunky. Needs to be altered a bit.</li>
    <li> I love this wig. For the price to be a wear out on the weekend is amazing! The highlights are a bit chunky but hey I am okay with it. ðŸ˜Š</li>
    <li> Kind of on the thin side, but I haven&#x27;t found a long style that has been thick yet. I did trim the bangs, because they were a bit long. The highlights are very dramatic, but  I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> Looks nothing like the picture. If you want to be Rogue from the X Men it&#x27;s great. Those streaks aren&#x27;t highlights though. They&#x27;re giant white patches.</li>
    <li> Good wig I washed it with warm water and. Conditioner no shampoo.  And thined it out cuz I don&#x27;t like thick hair but it is confterbil.  Idk if I look good as a blonde but for those of you that definitely do get it</li>
    <li> Loved it!  I received lots of complements.  My only complaint is that there were no instructions on how to adjust the fit.  I would definitely buy this brand again!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to go with a halloween costume.  The item arrived promptly and was of good quality as described but instead of the blonde I expected the wig actually looked like gray hair with white streaks.  It might have been good for a different sort of costume, but wasn&#x27;t at all right for my purposes.  Happily I was able to return the item within the prescribed time frame for a full refund.</li>
    <li> i good deal for price</li>
    <li> Nice wig for the price! Looks cute!</li>
    <li> Love love love it, I get complements every time I wear it. made great</li>
    <li> Nice quality mannequin wig--it maintains its shape very well!  It is easy to put on and take off.  The curls look realistic and the color shading is pretty and unique.  I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I love this wig very much I wear it almost everyday.. it looks very realistic now after  the curls I found were a little too fake looking but once I straightened it  much much better. Be careful do not click one day shipping it says on the box that it has shipped from kentucky therefore it is not possible to arrive in one day depends where u live im in massachusetts so... I hope whoever buys this also finds this wig very worth it. Cant go wrong with the price either... Enjoy ladies &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This wig is amaaaaazing. True to the color and style in the photo. I have only used it once on a client but there was almost NO shedding or tangling and it was not overly shiny. For a synthetic, this wig is absolutely wonderful and I would highly recommend any Kamo wig.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is simply fabulous and you can tell that so much care was put into making sure it was going to arrive in the condition that which it was shipped.</li>
    <li> It is a good wig. I was pleased with it</li>
    <li> Really poor quality. Not worth it</li>
    <li> Great wig for the price!</li>
    <li> I wore this wig for halloween and everyone thought it was my real hair. I am not used to long hair and this wig is comfortable and not to hot. The hair got a little ratty though the night but can be easily brushed out.</li>
    <li> It looks and feels natural. I love the highlights and low lights of it. :)</li>
    <li> I love it. It&#x27;s so soft. Looks and feels real. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the bangs look grey</li>
