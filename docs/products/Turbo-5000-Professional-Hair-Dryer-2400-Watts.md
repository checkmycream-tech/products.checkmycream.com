      <li>This does NOT get hot and it just \\&quot;blows\\&quot; your hair.  </li>
      <li>and for someone who does not want too much heat!</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>but this is pretty &#x27;turbo&#x27;.</li>
      <li>ugh, another dryer that does not provide hot air.  </li>
      <li>I used it this morning for the first time, and behold, no frizzed up hair, only shiny locks and smooth, bouncy style.</li>

      <li>so u have to hold it to use &#x27;high&#x27;.</li>
      <li>It is twice a fast as my old dryer</li>
      <li>For you New look if you didnt go to saloon.</li>
      <li>It has a removable filter for easy cleaning and weighs less than 2 pounds, but it works so efficiently  </li>
      <li>Light weight, very hot, same as my old one but for less the price.</li>
      <li>Heavy duty and very powerful.</li>
      <li>/&gt;A bit heavier than most dryers, but likely due to larger motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> /&gt;A bit heavier than most dryers, but likely due to larger motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Takes a little while to heat up to a decent dry temperature.</li>
<li> The product is not heavy, with less noise,and the head it tiny(which I like).</li>
<li> but it only gives medium to almost no hot air.</li>
<li> and since I have to straighten my hair after I dry it, it saves me a lot of time.  </li>
<li> The 2400 watts are by no means gentle, it’s a serious blast…  </li>
<li> It just &#x27;blows&#x27; the hair dry.  </li>
<li> But if someone just wanted to blow their hair dry, this one will do it.</li>
<li> It  use to take me 45 mins to blow dry my hair...</li>
<li> But if you depend on the heat to style and dry your hair-</li>
<li> I can blast my hair dry, leaving it straighter and easier to style with my styler.</li>
<li> Well with the Turbo 5000, my hair is dry in 5 min!</li>
<li> Professional dryer.really does the job on long thick hair.</li>
<li> Use it to dry the dog and it cuts dry time in half.</li>
<li> straight thick hair that requires very little styling…  </li>
<li> This dryer dried my hair in a fraction of the time of usually takes me with my old one.</li>
<li> I only tried it once, so I&#x27;m not able to comment on its durability.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t care about attachments, ions, or any of that other stuff.  </li>
<li> I have been searching and researching this for the past month, and I finally found the one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> have long (past my bra strap)</li>
<li> but usually takes FOREVER to dry  </li>
<li> My hair usually takes forever to dry</li>
<li> people hair is less time.  </li>
<li> Having thick curly hair, it usually takes me forever to dry my hair..</li>
<li> In fact I’ve cut my drying time in HALF!  </li>
<li> Plus I think it&#x27;s very heavy.</li>
<li> It cut my drying time by almost 1/2, in spite of my thick hair.</li>
<li> and i have THICK hair.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s impossible to style your hair with such a hair dryer.</li>
<li> I have very thick hair and struggled a lot with it.</li>
<li> If anything were to go wrong with this</li>
<li> I&#x27;m returning it - very disappointed.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It  use to take me 45 mins to blow dry my hair... Now I took 30 mins! LOVE IT.. Love this product! Totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> Chose this product specifically for the 2400 Watts power and didnt disappoint.  Very powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit heavier than most dryers, but likely due to larger motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a dryer with exceptional power - this is it</li>
    <li> I had no idea what a difference a dryer makes!  This dryer dried my hair in a fraction of the time of usually takes me with my old one. I used it this morning for the first time, and behold, no frizzed up hair, only shiny locks and smooth, bouncy style. I love this dryer. It has a removable filter for easy cleaning and weighs less than 2 pounds, but it works so efficiently  that could be much heavier and not make any difference. You research is finished. This is the dryer you&#x27;ve been looking for all your life.</li>
    <li> Professional dryer.really does the job on long thick hair. and for someone who does not want too much heat! bargain price!</li>
    <li> This dryer is very powerful, but it doesn&#x27;t get hot!  It just &#x27;blows&#x27; the hair dry.  You need heat to set your style.  Very disappointed. But if someone just wanted to blow their hair dry, this one will do it. But if you depend on the heat to style and dry your hair- DO NOT BUY. Plus I think it&#x27;s very heavy.</li>
    <li> I just received the Turbo 2400 hair dryer and I&#x27;m impressed with it&#x27;s power. It cut my drying time by almost 1/2, in spite of my thick hair.

    <li> It is so powerful! Having thick curly hair, it usually takes me forever to dry my hair..that&#x27;s why I needed something very powerful. Well with the Turbo 5000, my hair is dry in 5 min! That&#x27;s great! I would definitely recommend it to a friend!</li>
    <li> The product is everything I was expecting from it.  The power is good it help me straight my hair fast</li>
    <li> I always wanted a jprofessional hair dryer like my hairdresser uses, but thought I could not afford it.  This is a great buy and it dries my hair quickly and without leaving it fuzzy.  It is twice a fast as my old dryer and since I have to straighten my hair after I dry it, it saves me a lot of time.  Great buy for the money.</li>
    <li> Really good product! I have very thick hair and struggled a lot with it. This hair dryer works for me. It&#x27;s super powerful :)&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great dryer, especially for the price. My hair usually takes forever to dry but this is pretty &#x27;turbo&#x27;. My only issue is the speed button sticks on &#x27;medium&#x27; so u have to hold it to use &#x27;high&#x27;. Might just be a glitch in my dryer, though. Overall, I love it!</li>
    <li> Great Hair Dyer, Dries Fast, light weight, Great product. I run in the morning so, I dont have time to spend to much on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It dries super fast.....</li>
    <li> This is very powerful. It will blow the cobwebs off the ceiling (literally). Would like one speed lower on the blower for styling. Takes a little while to heat up to a decent dry temperature. Use it to dry the dog and it cuts dry time in half.</li>
    <li> ugh, another dryer that does not provide hot air.  Sure its 2400 watts but it only gives medium to almost no hot air. I will go back to buying Babyliss Pro BABNT5548 2000 Watt Ionic Nano Titanium with Integrated Ion Generator Hair Dryer this thing gets HOT HOT HOT HOT and been a cosmetologist I dry people hair is less time.  I tried the 2400 watts thinking it would be more powerful with air and temperature.</li>
    <li> So, I rarely write reviews… but this hair dryer has really impressed me!  I have been searching and researching this for the past month, and I finally found the one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long (past my bra strap) straight thick hair that requires very little styling…  but usually takes FOREVER to dry  I really wanted a fast hair dryer, one with a lot of power.  I didn&#x27;t care about attachments, ions, or any of that other stuff.  I simply wanted a super short drying time, and the Turbo 5000 has not disappointed!  The 2400 watts are by no means gentle, it’s a serious blast…  In fact I’ve cut my drying time in HALF!  I timed myself, it’s right under 3 minutes.  I cannot say enough about this hair dryer, I may even buy another to have as a backup just in case this goes out of production!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I can think of is that because it’s so powerful, it does create more tangles.  Understandable though, with all that wattage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you’re looking for a fast drying, powerful hair dryer, this is it!</li>
    <li> This is so powerful I love it. I can blast my hair dry, leaving it straighter and easier to style with my styler. Great value for the money which I rate highly when looking for an Amazon bargain. Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Light weight, very hot, same as my old one but for less the price. Iam very please with the product!!</li>
    <li> this dryer is so powerful that it drys my hair in three minutes and i have THICK hair.  i recommend this to ANYONE with hair!  LOL</li>
    <li> I recommend this product for me has been on of the most wonderful tools that I ever had.&lt;br /&gt;Good tool</li>
    <li> One of the reviewers here was right - This does NOT get hot and it just \\&quot;blows\\&quot; your hair.  It&#x27;s impossible to style your hair with such a hair dryer. I&#x27;m returning it - very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great hair blower! Heavy duty and very powerful. If anything were to go wrong with this I hope it will still be available to purchase again. Whoops just went in to do my hair and the heat has gone out. So upset this should have lasted longer&lt;br /&gt;Than this.</li>
    <li> Excelent! I like it because my hair look smooth and beautiful. For you New look if you didnt go to saloon.</li>
    <li> i received my hair blow drier this week but tried it yesterday. I love it a lot. Dries my hair faster. The product is not heavy, with less noise,and the head it tiny(which I like). This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
