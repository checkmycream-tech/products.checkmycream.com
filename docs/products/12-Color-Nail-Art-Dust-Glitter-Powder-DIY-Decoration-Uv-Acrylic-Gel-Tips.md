      <li>Price is good and shipping was very fast.</li>
      <li>Good for the price, but the colors were nowhere as pretty as the picture.</li>
      <li>So far it seems great.  </li>
      <li>All of my glitter tubs were full, it has cute packaging and</li>
      <li>The colors are bright and I got all 12 different colors :)</li>
      <li>Was looking forward to the light neon looking ones.</li>
      <li>Super fun and cute to use</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok pretty colors</li>
      <li>I ordered this and was so excited for it to come</li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>Expected it to be bigger and have more glitter, but for the price it was great!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the glitter twice, over colored polish AND clear, and they remove relatively easy with non acetone remover, but better with an acetone remover.</li>
      <li>But still very pretty</li>
      <li>Trying to find the ones I had with a case that came with it and was completely full with colorful glitter for gel cover tips.</li>
      <li>Pretty colors!</li>
      <li>Definitely worth what you are paying for.</li>
      <li>Shipper immediately sent me some replacements right away, though.  </li>
      <li>I wish it had more glitter , the containers are half full.</li>

      <li>Please help I really want these.</li>
      <li>my order came really fast</li>
      <li>I got them about two weeks early!!!</li>
      <li>Go to walmart and buy super fine glitter, you&#x27;ll get ten times the amount of cute glitter for the same price AND you wont have to wait a month for it to ship from the other side of the world.</li>
      <li>Small container, but nice colors.</li>
      <li>The colors are nice, but half of the microscopic tubes (each tube is about the size of a quarter) were already more than half way empty.</li>
      <li>But its fun to use and stays on for long.</li>
      <li>Came WAYYYY early.</li>
      <li>So, naturally I ran out of glitter.  </li>
      <li>I recommend but not for someone who wants to get multiple uses out of each color.</li>
      <li>Product was ok, very small containers.</li>
      <li>Packaging smaller than expected but glitter was pretty!</li>
      <li>Was shipped very fast then what was expected thank you!</li>
      <li>Almost all the containers were super loose when they finally showed up and half the glitter was all over inside of the packaging</li>

<li> Was shipped very fast then what was expected thank you!</li>
<li> Almost all the containers were super loose when they finally showed up and half the glitter was all over inside of the packaging</li>
<li> So much for such little cost!</li>
<li> As I figured they would be quite small but the little containers are actually full of glitter</li>
<li> The containers are fall empty and some were open and spilled all over the inside of the bigger bag they came in.</li>
<li> One dark blue, one dark yellow, and one bronze.</li>
<li> only the darker pink glitter was not screwed tightly.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not complaining I expected it by looking at the price</li>
<li> There&#x27;s not much there, but it&#x27;s inexpensive also.</li>
<li> There was a little loose glitter in the box, but the containers were all tightly closed and not leaking.</li>
<li> It shipped way faster than I expected!</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t get colores I wanted and some of them were half empty.</li>
<li> The only thing that was bad was that one of the containers with the glitter came in a little open, so it did spill on its way here, but not by much.</li>
<li> Its not worth your money.</li>
<li> Average glitter.</li>
<li> the inside which I did not like, very few glitters were just the slightest open and created very small mess when you took them out the package but wasn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
<li> Expected delivery b/t Feb 5th 2015 and Feb 24th 2015, I got in Jan!!</li>
<li> Not the standard glitter but very small</li>
<li> They are very small, about the size of a quarter if not smaller.</li>
<li> Black 2.</li>
<li> I JUST MADE A MESS WITH IT.</li>
<li> Green 7.Red 8.</li>
<li> Neon Green 6.</li>
<li> They are about a quarter size round and four quarters sized thick.</li>
<li> each glitter container is very small</li>
<li> mmmm its not good ...</li>
<li> Poor Product!</li>
<li> I was very confused</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t get the colors that are shown in the picture all dark colors very disappointed.</li>
<li> Delivered in about 3 weeks, wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
<li> but the packaging is terrible.</li>

    <li> Good for the price, but the colors were nowhere as pretty as the picture. Out of the 12, four were all an orangy-red. Three were different shades of gold. Two different shades of purple. One dark blue, one dark yellow, and one bronze. It shipped way faster than I expected!</li>
    <li> each glitter container is very small I&#x27;m not complaining I expected it by looking at the price just letting you know overall I love the glitters the colors were so beautiful and very cheap I recommend but not for someone who wants to get multiple uses out of each color. It arrived in this ver flimsy packaging without the bubblewrap lining on the inside which I did not like, very few glitters were just the slightest open and created very small mess when you took them out the package but wasn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
    <li> The product it good but the packaging is terrible. The containers are fall empty and some were open and spilled all over the inside of the bigger bag they came in.</li>
    <li> Came WAYYYY early. Expected delivery b/t Feb 5th 2015 and Feb 24th 2015, I got in Jan!! Anyway! All of my glitter tubs were full, it has cute packaging and only the darker pink glitter was not screwed tightly. For having come from Hong Kong, it was in good shape! I&#x27;ve used the glitter twice, over colored polish AND clear, and they remove relatively easy with non acetone remover, but better with an acetone remover. Super fun and cute to use, I love the way they catch the light!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get colores I wanted and some of them were half empty.But its fun to use and stays on for long. For this price it&#x27;s quite good dial.</li>
    <li> These glitters are great! The only thing that was bad was that one of the containers with the glitter came in a little open, so it did spill on its way here, but not by much. Still a very nice product! I would&lt;br /&gt;Buy it again!</li>
    <li> Expected it to be bigger and have more glitter, but for the price it was great!</li>
    <li> Love this. They are very small, about the size of a quarter if not smaller. The glitter stays on well and you get multiples of the same color. Definitely worth what you are paying for.</li>
    <li> Didnt receive the correct colors! Multiples of the same color. Don&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> Packaging smaller than expected but glitter was pretty!</li>
    <li> Almost all the containers were super loose when they finally showed up and half the glitter was all over inside of the packaging</li>
    <li> As I figured they would be quite small but the little containers are actually full of glitter so I do not feel cheated out of it. Nice colors love the pinks, and the pastels.</li>
    <li> Pretty colors! My order came today and I was impressed how bright the colors are,, I really like the bright Pink glitter! I wish it had more glitter , the containers are half full. It&#x27;s okay my order came really fast and I didn&#x27;t have any spilled glitter in the package so I&#x27;m very happy. I look forward to ordering more soon! Good price for 12 glitters!!</li>

    <li> These glitters are nice. Small container, but nice colors. You can create a lot of different looks with this set.</li>
    <li> I JUST MADE A MESS WITH IT. I&#x27;M SURE SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE DOING COULD DO GREAT THINGS WITH IT.</li>
    <li> Average glitter. Nothing special. Looks like all tiny glitters do &amp; is cheaper than buying in stores.</li>
    <li> i wish more businesses were like this one, excellent customer service and great products, will definately do business with them again in the future, thank you so much</li>

    <li> mmmm its not good ...it gets stiky ..</li>
    <li> I ordered this and was so excited for it to come but when I went to go track it it wasn&#x27;t in &amp;#34; my orders&amp;#34;. I was very confused so I searched it to see if it was out of stock but it wasnt . Please help I really want these.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened the first time but without any doubt they gave me another thanks for being there</li>
    <li> Arrived with containers opened and glitter spilled all over the place.  Shipper immediately sent me some replacements right away, though.  There&#x27;s not much there, but it&#x27;s inexpensive also.</li>
    <li> My kid thinks that the tooth fairy spews glitter all over the house.  So, naturally I ran out of glitter.  So I bought this stuff.  So far it seems great.  I&#x27;ve only used a bit.  Love it. My kids thinks that she&#x27;s been sprinkled by fairy dust.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t give you the colors shown</li>
    <li> Product was ok, very small containers. They are about a quarter size round and four quarters sized thick. But still very pretty</li>
