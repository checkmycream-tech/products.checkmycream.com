      <li>Saw the commercials for the product, but wasn&#x27;t sure.</li>
      <li>My favorite eye shadow, ever, is [[ASIN:B004X8LBS0</li>
      <li>The eyeshadow was much more glittery than metallic.</li>
      <li>Its really lovely.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d like it a lot more.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>:)    </li>
      <li>I love the color.</li>
      <li>but okay for going out at night.  </li>
      <li>However, when it arrived, the top to the case was cracked/broken.  </li>
      <li>I also love that they give you the 4 shades that you should use for the &amp;#34;smokey&amp;#34; eye impact.</li>
      <li>more so I have one in each of my homes and my travel bag.</li>
      <li>so it definetly makes them stand out more with this eyeshadow.</li>
      <li>Its been a year and the color is still pretty good.</li>
      <li>What I love is their smooth, silky texture.</li>
      <li>This is a great combination of natural colors that I like.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to apply and comes off easy.</li>
      <li>Just one sweep across the lid and the makeup spreads easily.</li>
      <li>Good colors, very natural with a bit of a shimmer to it.</li>
      <li>This eye shadow is great for blue eyes, and every day wear.</li>
      <li>Find the colours too light.</li>
      <li>The 4 colors and super and easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the perfect amount of sparkle without going overboard.</li>
      <li>Glitz\\&quot; colors albeit slightly less brilliant.  </li>
      <li>very glitzy, very glittery, and stays on surprisingly well.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t imagine a better bang for my buck, given that this is so reasonably</li>
      <li>You have to use quiet a bit to get good color</li>
      <li>, it comes off pretty easy.</li>
      <li>(I thought it would be more pink), still it is a nice pack</li>
      <li>Luckily, none of the shadow was damaged because of this</li>
      <li>The colors were fine, just all the glitter was too much, it looks like you borrowed a 13yr.</li>
      <li>Color are good but not very pigmented.</li>
      <li>I love the colors, as a natural redhead</li>
      <li>The colors in this set are not quite as bright, and have less shimmer than Bronze Glitz.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good especially for work, where I don&#x27;t want to wear too loud of an eyeshadow.</li>
      <li>I love the colors, but for a total of $9.96, I think it&#x27;s better to just wait and buy it at the store next time.</li>
      <li>it looks exactly like it does in the picture</li>
      <li>in all I like the set, and if I didn&#x27;t already have a favorite by Maybelline that is similar to this set</li>
      <li>Price was better than the local stores</li>
      <li>this was perfect because Its not too dark or heavy.</li>
      <li>I use this set a lot, and I am certain that I will continue to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>these are very flattering.</li>
      <li>It does not have the creamy texture that I really like</li>
      <li>I received my eye shadow in a very timely manner, considering that I am deployed to an overseas location (ordered Feb 11, received Feb 21).  </li>
      <li>I really like this eyeshadow.  </li>
      <li>, I just keep re-buying it after I use the whole thing up.</li>
      <li>The combinations are very spot-on.  </li>
      <li>The highlight is fabulous and brightens your eyes with just a dab in the inner corner and a touch on the brow bone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I was able to make a quick fix to the lid with a little scotch tape!  </li>
      <li>Nice shimmery colors, long lasting hold.</li>
      <li>Colors are vibrant and blend well together.</li>
      <li>Very affordable yet professional result.  </li>
      <li>It has deeper colors than the photo, but they are richer than normal eyeshadow colors for this price.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite quad color grouping and I found this on amazon one day after i spent countless hours and fuel searching store after store and despairing when no one had this product.</li>
      <li>That is true however the guide is printed on the back for future reference!</li>
      <li>The colors are neutral so they work well with almost anything, you can also use this set and match it to other to make fun colors.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not too dark or harsh, but gives nice definition to my blue/grey eyes.</li>
      <li>I like especially the high lighting color.  </li>
      <li>They all look great together, and I am mad about how they compliment my red hair!</li>
      <li>Subtle and easy.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t smudge, but will leave glittery dust on your cheeks if you&#x27;re not careful in the application</li>
      <li>/&gt;The shadows are fantastic and subtle for workday wear, and can be built up for a night out.</li>
      <li>it is a little shiny, but not too much.</li>

    <li> I received my eye shadow in a very timely manner, considering that I am deployed to an overseas location (ordered Feb 11, received Feb 21).  However, when it arrived, the top to the case was cracked/broken.  Luckily, none of the shadow was damaged because of this and I was able to make a quick fix to the lid with a little scotch tape!  :)    I love the colors, but for a total of $9.96, I think it&#x27;s better to just wait and buy it at the store next time.</li>
    <li> like this product colors  are nice</li>
    <li> works great, came on time</li>
    <li> this was perfect because Its not too dark or heavy. i didnt mind the glitter, it comes off pretty easy.</li>
    <li> This did arrive with a broken seal- as some other reviewers mentioned. I don&#x27;t think someone had used it, just that it wasn&#x27;t packaged properly (Had nothing to cover it, was just loose in the box). The eyeshadow was much more glittery than metallic. The colors were fine, just all the glitter was too much, it looks like you borrowed a 13yr. olds makeup.</li>
    <li> My favorite eye shadow, ever, is [[ASIN:B004X8LBS0 Maybelline Expert Wear Shadow Trio, Bronze Glitz]] hands down.  None of my local stores are carrying it anymore, and it&#x27;s starting to look like Amazon won&#x27;t be either.  Currently you can only buy it from a 3rd party seller - for a jacked-up price when you consider the shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this compact and found the lid, crease, and brow colors to all be quite reminiscent of the \\&quot;Bronze Glitz\\&quot; colors albeit slightly less brilliant.  The colors in this set are not quite as bright, and have less shimmer than Bronze Glitz.  They do blend well and wear fairly well.  Not as well as Bronze Glitz though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you are getting much less lid and crease color in exchange for the liner color, which I don&#x27;t use anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I like the set, and if I didn&#x27;t already have a favorite by Maybelline that is similar to this set I&#x27;d like it a lot more.</li>
    <li> Color are good but not very pigmented. You have to use quiet a bit to get good color but the shimmer is good.</li>
    <li> Subtle and easy. I always keep this on hand for myself -  dark blue eyes. It&#x27;s good especially for work, where I don&#x27;t want to wear too loud of an eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> Its been a year and the color is still pretty good. Good product for something that is a good price. I have chanel eye cream makeup and this powder lasts longer that $30 eye cream makeup!</li>
    <li> Nice product, good seller!</li>
    <li> I love the color. It looks different online (I thought it would be more pink), still it is a nice pack</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow is a must have for a nature and beautiful look. it is a little shiny, but not too much.</li>
    <li> It has deeper colors than the photo, but they are richer than normal eyeshadow colors for this price. Its really lovely.</li>
    <li> I guess I should have seen it in the picture or because it&#x27;s called &amp;#34;Modern Metallics&amp;#34;...but this eyeshadow is all glitter and no pigment. I regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> The colors are neutral so they work well with almost anything, you can also use this set and match it to other to make fun colors. Mix with Irish mist to make gold and fall colors. Mix with pink to make a red hue that screams sun. Love this product.</li>
    <li> I love the colors, as a natural redhead these are very flattering. I use them as instructed and it&#x27;s not too dark or harsh, but gives nice definition to my blue/grey eyes. Definitely a buy-again!</li>
    <li> the color isnt what it looks like&lt;br /&gt;it is a little too orangy for my liking</li>
    <li> I love these eye shadows! Great price! Make&#x27;s a perfect smokey eye and the colors are perfect!!! A must try!</li>
    <li> This is the best!  I wanted shimmer and I got it!  The 4 colors and super and easy to apply.  This comes with the necessary 2 applicators for the colors to each have a side.  I have since purchased more so I have one in each of my homes and my travel bag.</li>
    <li> this stuff is great it looks exactly like it does in the picture and I have blue eyes so it definetly makes them stand out more with this eyeshadow. I would recommend to anyone looking for a nice brown coloring.</li>
    <li> If you want &amp;#34;blue eyes&amp;#34; to stand out use Maybelline &amp;#34;sands-shimmer-bronze of colors&amp;#34; is perfect. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Maybelline products.</li>
    <li> This eye shadow is great for blue eyes, and every day wear. The combinations are very spot-on.  I just wish that it lasted a little bit longer.</li>
    <li> Somewhat disappointed with the fact that this eye shadow is too light and sparkly.  Definitely not something I would wear to the office but okay for going out at night.  The darkest brown in the set isn&#x27;t dark. It is easy to apply and comes off easy.</li>
    <li> Good colors, very natural with a bit of a shimmer to it.</li>
    <li> Find the colours too light.</li>
    <li> Like this product. Saw the commercials for the product, but wasn&#x27;t sure. It works for me. Price was better than the local stores so I&#x27;m on the wagon!</li>
    <li> I really like this eyeshadow.  This is a great value.  It lasts a long time.  Looks nice when applied.  I would buy it again</li>
    <li> I love all the eye shadows from Maybelline!  This last all day and come in all different shades to match everything!</li>
    <li> very glitzy, very glittery, and stays on surprisingly well. Doesn&#x27;t smudge, but will leave glittery dust on your cheeks if you&#x27;re not careful in the application</li>
    <li> I like this product. It is easy to apply and has good staying power. Great price and you can rely on Maybelline.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin and a lot of eye shadows are too dark to look anything but clownish but this eyeshadow is perfect!</li>
    <li> These are great colors in a neutral palate. Someone mentioned previously that the guide to wear the colors is printed on the shadow themselves so disappears after a couple of uses. That is true however the guide is printed on the back for future reference!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this eye shadow nearly every day for the past 5 years. It&#x27;s the perfect amount of sparkle without going overboard. I also love that they give you the 4 shades that you should use for the &amp;#34;smokey&amp;#34; eye impact. It&#x27;s the perfect set for day to night wear.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite quad color grouping and I found this on amazon one day after i spent countless hours and fuel searching store after store and despairing when no one had this product. Thank you Amazon!! I only wish I would have thought of looking online sooner, but just in case... I bought two, lol!</li>
    <li> This has very nice colors,  easy to apply.  And i like it has an explanation on the back how to do it.</li>
    <li> My duaghter loves this eyeshadow.  The colors are beautiful and coordinated well.  She was very impressed with how the shadows are defined by area of use.  She will be buying other color blends made by Maybelline Quads.</li>
    <li> my wife bought this item for party style makeup even thought she haven&#x27;t use it yet, it seems to be placed with it</li>
    <li> It does not have the creamy texture that I really like but it is great. The color stays for hours.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a very happy customer</li>
    <li> This is a great combination of natural colors that I like.  Very affordable yet professional result.  I like especially the high lighting color.  It has tons of simmering effect and I can&#x27;t get enough of it.</li>
    <li> I totally love this beautiful bronze set of eye shadows. They all look great together, and I am mad about how they compliment my red hair! The instructions on the package are a bonus, but you can play around and use them any way you like. I use this set a lot, and I am certain that I will continue to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shadows also have a great deal of staying power, so this is the type of product that you might have to pay much more for in another brand.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute go-to eye palette for everyday wear. I&#x27;ve been using this same palette for 5+ years now, I just keep re-buying it after I use the whole thing up. I couldn&#x27;t imagine a better bang for my buck, given that this is so reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shadows are fantastic and subtle for workday wear, and can be built up for a night out. What I love is their smooth, silky texture. Just one sweep across the lid and the makeup spreads easily. It lasts all day long and holds a delicate shimmer. I&#x27;ve never had this eye shadow crease on me, even when worn without a primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the Lid and Crease colors can be worn all over the eyelid for a simple look. The highlight is fabulous and brightens your eyes with just a dab in the inner corner and a touch on the brow bone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge applicators that come along with this product deposit color very nicely, so no need to splurge on expensive brushes. You won&#x27;t regret giving this palette a try.</li>
    <li> Nice shimmery colors, long lasting hold. Colors are vibrant and blend well together. Good quality for the price.</li>
