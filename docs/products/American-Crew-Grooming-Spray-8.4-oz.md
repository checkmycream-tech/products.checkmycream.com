      <li>I&#x27;ve used the crew spray for many years.  </li>
      <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite hair product</li>
      <li>Works best for me if sprayed on wet hair then combed out after hair dries.</li>
      <li>If I kept the \\&quot;empty\\&quot;, it works out fine.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good enough, but I&#x27;m still looking for something better.</li>
      <li>Love the product and will choose a more dependable vendor on my next order.</li>
      <li>Overall, very satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>Buying it on Amazon was easy, fast and uncomplicated.</li>
      <li>Great hold without making my husbands hair look stiff.</li>
      <li>Four stars for the new spray nozzle which is not as fine of a mist.</li>
      <li>I have to say, it works pretty well.</li>

      <li>It seems to hold my hair (fine and thinning) in place without feeling as if it were varnish and becoming stiff.</li>
      <li>&gt; The price is somewhat high- much higher than one would want to pay for this type of product</li>
      <li>He really likes it.</li>
      <li>Then vendor sold at a at very competitive price</li>
      <li>This 1 star review is due to the fact that the bottle is made of the most flimsy plastic I have ever encountered.  </li>
      <li>American Crew Grooming Spray, 8.45 oz  is not a heavy substance but a light mist spray that really holds your hair in place.  </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t like concrete hair, this is the stuff you&#x27;ll want.</li>
      <li>It almost looks fake lol.</li>
      <li>This pretty much lasts all day long.</li>
      <li>The barber uses this stuff on my hair after each haircut, and it is not excessively aromatic.</li>
      <li>I just transfer the sprayer from the old to the new.  </li>
      <li>I would say this is (was) my second most fragile possession, second only to the carton of eggs in my refrigerator.</li>
      <li>American Crew does the job very well.</li>
      <li>I was sad when Crew stopped making the shaving cream I liked, so I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed about this product.</li>
      <li>All one has to do is pass a comb through it after it has dried and most of that &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34; look goes away while still providing firm holding.</li>
      <li>A little pricey but still good stuff and not to difficult to use.</li>

<li> A little pricey but still good stuff and not to difficult to use.</li>
<li> This results in one very specific part of your hair getting doused in spray and the rest staying dry.</li>
<li> Any other hairspray will do the same thing.</li>
<li> This stuff not only works, but when I hit the highway with the windows down my hair doesn&#x27;t move.</li>
<li> I wish they would apply a little extra QA check on that part of the product.  </li>
<li> The spread isn&#x27;t wide.</li>
<li> About what I expected.  </li>
<li> Not strong enough as a stand alone product, but works well when used with a stronger hairspray.</li>
<li> and I know I got other product they got lost</li>
<li> I purchase ii regularly but not often as it lasts due to the small amount required to use.</li>
<li> will not let you down.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if my bottle is defective or if it&#x27;s just a terrible spraying design, but the actual spray cans seem to do a much better job of evenly applying the product to hair.</li>
<li> The hair salon sells it for $16 and got it for half that here.</li>
<li> Instead of spraying a little cloud of mist that covers your hair, it shoots out like a little spritzer bottle.</li>
<li> I use lots of American Crew products when the prices aren&#x27;t prohibitively expensive.</li>
<li> but then charged $11 to ship 3 bolltes in a small box.  </li>
<li> It always seems hard to find the spray version in stores and when I do the price is way up there.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s too expensive!</li>
<li> /&gt;That said, the spritzer bottle itself is terrible.</li>

    <li> This stuff holds excellent and actually helps with the sun.  I&#x27;m a big American Crew fan and this hair spray will not let you down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the crew spray for many years.  About 1 in 6 bottles I purchase has a defective spray mechanism.  If I kept the \\&quot;empty\\&quot;, it works out fine.  I just transfer the sprayer from the old to the new.  I wish they would apply a little extra QA check on that part of the product.  Then vendor sold at a at very competitive price but then charged $11 to ship 3 bolltes in a small box.  Watch these guys.  Their profit is in the shipping charges.  I will not use them again.</li>
    <li> Works best for me if sprayed on wet hair then combed out after hair dries. The hair salon sells it for $16 and got it for half that here. Even paying postage it is a savings.</li>
    <li> We Love this product! Great hold without making my husbands hair look stiff. Would definatly recommend it for all men!</li>
    <li> I use lots of American Crew products when the prices aren&#x27;t prohibitively expensive. I use the Forming Cream every day to give my hair some volume and shape. However, the forming cream doesn&#x27;t have a great hold so I thought I&#x27;d get this stuff to supplement it. I have to say, it works pretty well. Whipping winds are no match for the hold this product provides and it doesn&#x27;t make your hair too stiff/crunchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the spritzer bottle itself is terrible. Instead of spraying a little cloud of mist that covers your hair, it shoots out like a little spritzer bottle. This results in one very specific part of your hair getting doused in spray and the rest staying dry. I don&#x27;t know if my bottle is defective or if it&#x27;s just a terrible spraying design, but the actual spray cans seem to do a much better job of evenly applying the product to hair.</li>
    <li> package arrived torn from the bottle leaking!</li>
    <li> This grooming spray always works well for me and this bottle seems even better than the last one I purchased.</li>
    <li> The barber uses this stuff on my hair after each haircut, and it is not excessively aromatic.It seems to hold my hair (fine and thinning) in place without feeling as if it were varnish and becoming stiff.</li>
    <li> Not strong enough as a stand alone product, but works well when used with a stronger hairspray.</li>
    <li> Great Product - this was a reorder</li>
    <li> This is excellent stuff but totally expensive</li>
    <li> Very light hair hold and is not sticky and will work well in almost all conditions.&lt;br /&gt; The price is somewhat high- much higher than one would want to pay for this type of product</li>
    <li> The spray itself works pretty well. About what I expected.  This 1 star review is due to the fact that the bottle is made of the most flimsy plastic I have ever encountered.  I bought this last week, and after knocking it off my 3 foot tall dresser, the bottle shattered and it spilled all over the floor.  I would say this is (was) my second most fragile possession, second only to the carton of eggs in my refrigerator.</li>
    <li> Love it, best I have used.</li>
    <li> Any other hairspray will do the same thing. It&#x27;s too expensive!</li>
    <li> This product works well, I have used it for years.</li>
    <li> This product continues to be a favorite. I purchase ii regularly but not often as it lasts due to the small amount required to use.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years... I hope they never stop making it. I was sad when Crew stopped making the shaving cream I liked, so I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed about this product.</li>
    <li> This is not what was shipped. I got a squeeze bottle gel not the spray..</li>
    <li> Great product, price and delivery!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good enough, but I&#x27;m still looking for something better. The spread isn&#x27;t wide. 4/5 4/5 4/5 4/5 4/5 4/5</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few years now and been very satisfied.  I was very happy with my purchase on Amazon and intend to re-up with them again.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite hair product</li>
    <li> American Crew Grooming Spray, 8.45 oz  is not a heavy substance but a light mist spray that really holds your hair in place.  My hair is styled short and will stick out like a burr, especially on the sides, if not managed. It is un-scented. American Crew does the job very well.</li>
    <li> It always seems hard to find the spray version in stores and when I do the price is way up there. The price is cheaper at Amazon AND it ships in two days for Prime members. Four stars for the new spray nozzle which is not as fine of a mist.</li>
    <li> This stuff not only works, but when I hit the highway with the windows down my hair doesn&#x27;t move. It almost looks fake lol. This pretty much lasts all day long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered seven items and I received only one the one I pay $30 for and I know I got other product they got lost I don&#x27;t know what to happen and how to track it</li>
    <li> I use this product every day. I think it is beneficial to good hair care because it seems to give mine a healthy shine. I also apply it to my hair to help thicken it while it is drying.</li>
    <li> Ordered by dad to control flyaway hair. He really likes it.</li>
    <li> Love the product and will choose a more dependable vendor on my next order.</li>
    <li> Have used this product before.  If you don&#x27;t like concrete hair, this is the stuff you&#x27;ll want.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating as this is my husband favorite grooming spray. Buying it on Amazon was easy, fast and uncomplicated. I would recommend this product to anyone who likes this kind of product!!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product but I don&#x27;t like paying salon prices. We&#x27;ve been happy with the product and the company.</li>
    <li> Great hold but no scent.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  used many products over the years and this is the best. Find my wife using this too.</li>
    <li> The spray provides very good holding without that &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34; feel or look. All one has to do is pass a comb through it after it has dried and most of that &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34; look goes away while still providing firm holding. Overall, very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> A little pricey but still good stuff and not to difficult to use. I will continue to purchase and use.</li>
