    <li> I have used allot of foundations and Mary Kay gives me a natural, smooth cover with zero skin break outs. This is my brand!!! I have no intentions of ever changing. Very Satisfied customer on this foundation</li>
    <li> Been using MK for years.  Medium coverage does a great job of evening out the color variations on my face.  looks natural.  Freckles show through but are tempered.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Only thing that was off was the cylinder box it&#x27;s in was open.</li>
    <li> I am 57 years old and still have breakouts. This product has always kept me from breaking out without drying my skin. Don&#x27;t know how it does it but I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup I have been using it for a little over a year now and amazon is the cheapest place to get it.</li>

    <li> product was more than 10 years old</li>
    <li> From what I can tell this product was 10 years old. Not exaggerating - 10 years old.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Great price.  No problems using it.  I would buy it again.  I would recommend this to a friend</li>
    <li> I have used Mary Kay products for at least 25 years and have always loved them. This medium coverage foundation covers up all my blemishes but isn&#x27;t too heavy.</li>
    <li> Yes I would recommend this product to anyone... I have been using Mary Kay for about 20 years now and have never had a problem with anything I ever bought from them.... this foundation is not heavy.... it has sunscreen incorporated in it.... it goes on smooth and even..... thank you Mary Kay</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for some older foundation  Medium Coverage Foundation Beige 300. The replacement was a much lighter color than the original foundation. I guess that Mary Kay has changed their colors. This is the only reason it earned 4 stars. The change was nothing to do with the seller.</li>
    <li> It was good as always and came quickly as I was going out of town for a week and needed it ASAP</li>
