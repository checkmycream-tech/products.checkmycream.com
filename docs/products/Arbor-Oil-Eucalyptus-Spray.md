      <li>I love the smell, my family doesn&#x27;t</li>
      <li>My saline nasal spray with eucalyptus oil works much better than Dulera, so I&#x27;ve decided to stay on the substitute inhaler.</li>
      <li>I really love this product it makes breathing easier.</li>
      <li>Just a couple of sprays in the shower and my entire upstairs smelled wonderful and the shower had that spa affect.  </li>
      <li>It sure helps with colds and allergies</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for many years after coming across it at a Health Expo.</li>
      <li>Have already purchased a couple more for gift giving.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find anywhere except Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Eucalyptus has a strong scent to begin with.</li>
      <li>I have also used Eucalyptus oil and water to clean and refresh surface in my home.</li>
      <li>I have given away so many bottles and recommended it to so many people, so I always make sure I have at lease one full bottle or two all year long.  </li>
      <li>Even when not sick I spray some on the edges of pillow case for a relaxing off to sleep experience.</li>
      <li>This one seems more pure.</li>
      <li>Well, I think it claims to be more pure..  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s potency lasts for a long time and I keep this in my personal medicinal arsenal it is excellent.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it to see people you care about get relief from their ailments without prescription drugs.  </li>
      <li>The sprayer is fine enough to give a great mist and the eucalyptus really helps open the&lt;br /&gt;bronchial passages.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>OK but arouma does not last for me</li>
      <li>I like the item and the smell is great, however each bottle I have owned has broken at some point with regards to the sprayer.  </li>
      <li>All I have to say about this product is that I feel I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
      <li>It opened up my stuffy nose and seemed to help clear my chest congestion as fast as over the counter medicine.</li>
      <li>If you rub it on right when you feel it tingling through the skin, and then some lip balm to keep it from evaporating, it will be gone the next morning and will not erupt!  </li>
      <li>Pure &amp; natural and much higher quality than similar products.</li>
      <li>I purchased this item to help control my sinus, it works great, sinus remains open up and not clogged, with just a small spray into the palm of our hands, a few rubbing of the hands together, then place over your nose with both hands closed together away from the eyes, breath in vapors and your sinus remains open,breathing is so much better, try it, it works</li>
      <li>I use it topically for first aid.</li>
      <li>and it comes in a clear glass spray bottle</li>
      <li>Most other Eucalyptus Oils don&#x27;t work, they often seem to contain some other aggravating odor.</li>
      <li>and apparently it Is.</li>

<li> Highly recommend and a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> Wow, whenever i feel sick or anybody (Co-workers) just spray on a napkin &amp; smell the aroma &amp; you will feel better in no time.</li>
<li> And I&#x27;ve tried other brands from the health stores when they were out of Arbor Oil brand, but it&#x27;s just not the same quality and pureness.  </li>
<li> It now shoots out in a straight line instead of a mist which is annoying, and had the same problem w earlier bottle.  </li>
<li> I put about 2 drops of eucalyptus oil per each half ounce in the spray bottles.</li>
<li> First time using it for cold and cough and didn&#x27;t need to use any over the counter medicines.</li>
<li> I had to return this spray oil because the scent was a little too concentrated for my taste.  </li>
<li> I use a few sprays in the corner of my shower where the water won&#x27;t wash it away for a relaxing treat.</li>
<li> Helps clear the sinuses during cold and allergy seasons.</li>
<li> I have used it in hot steam for the grandkids when they were sick and sprayed the room where they were sleeping when they coughed through the night, and it works wonders for cold sores.  </li>
<li> If it has already erupted, it will halt it from getting worse.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I used it on my pillow case when I had a cold.</li>
<li> I have asthma, and I&#x27;ve found that spraying the Eucalyptus Arbor Oil on my pillow when I have a cold or allergies -- or just any time, for that matter!</li>

    <li> Smell delicious .I spray on the bed when my kids are sick,to help them to breathe,very effective.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Using to help with flea repelling. I love the smell, my family doesn&#x27;t but it helps with seasonal allergy stuffiness too! We have 9 rescued animals and fleas are ALWAYS a problem in Florida so I hope it does the trick.</li>
    <li> OK but arouma does not last for me</li>
    <li> I have asthma, and I&#x27;ve found that spraying the Eucalyptus Arbor Oil on my pillow when I have a cold or allergies -- or just any time, for that matter! -- helps me sleep. Most other Eucalyptus Oils don&#x27;t work, they often seem to contain some other aggravating odor. This one seems more pure. Well, I think it claims to be more pure..  and apparently it Is. The eucalyptus scent is very pleasantly crisp &amp; clean.</li>
    <li> Great to spray under your pillow before bed.</li>
    <li> I was fed up with OTC and prescription meds that did not relieve my nasal passage irritation and congestion. Bought Eucalyptus Arbor Oil in a health food store after the store worker recommended to me. I spray into a tissue and inhale and this works so well to soothe my nasal passages and the congestion. Helps me sleep. I have also used Eucalyptus oil and water to clean and refresh surface in my home.</li>
    <li> Wow, whenever i feel sick or anybody (Co-workers) just spray on a napkin &amp; smell the aroma &amp; you will feel better in no time.</li>

    <li> I use this in my diffuser at night and it helps the air quality.</li>
    <li> Pure &amp; natural and much higher quality than similar products. I use a few sprays in the corner of my shower where the water won&#x27;t wash it away for a relaxing treat. Just a couple of sprays in the shower and my entire upstairs smelled wonderful and the shower had that spa affect.  I use it topically for first aid. I used it on my pillow case when I had a cold. I put a tiny bit on a cloth and breathed it in when I had a cough. First time using it for cold and cough and didn&#x27;t need to use any over the counter medicines. It opened up my stuffy nose and seemed to help clear my chest congestion as fast as over the counter medicine. Even when not sick I spray some on the edges of pillow case for a relaxing off to sleep experience. Highly recommend and a little goes a long way. Have already purchased a couple more for gift giving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I spray it on my pillow at night or on myself after a shower or on my wrists during the day</li>
    <li> Put on feet for cough in anyone in your family!&lt;br /&gt;Miracle worker!</li>
    <li> helps loosen up my sinuses</li>
    <li> I really love this product it makes breathing easier. It is very pleasant.</li>
    <li> I had read online about anecdotal accounts of persons using diluted eucalyptus oil as an inhalant for respiratory problems. So I thought I&#x27;d try it. I have chronic bronchitis and moderately severe allergy and sinus problems.  I have been using for years an over-the-counter nasal saline spray. I put about 2 drops of eucalyptus oil per each half ounce in the spray bottles. I use the modified nasal spray several times each day, breathing deeply about 50 times to move the inhalant to my lungs. I have been using this method in place of a prescription Dulera inhaler. My saline nasal spray with eucalyptus oil works much better than Dulera, so I&#x27;ve decided to stay on the substitute inhaler.</li>
    <li> I spray this on my pillow anytime I feel allergies or sinus congestion coming on. And by the morning I&#x27;m all cleared up.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff..won&#x27;t be without...immediately clears a stuffy nose and chest congestion. ..love the smell.</li>
    <li> I like the item and the smell is great, however each bottle I have owned has broken at some point with regards to the sprayer.  It now shoots out in a straight line instead of a mist which is annoying, and had the same problem w earlier bottle.  If they improved the sprayer this would get 5 stars</li>
    <li> Work very good on stuffy nose! I bought for my kids, and I spray couple times on the corner of the pillow and they can have a calm sleep at night.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> All I have to say about this product is that I feel I can&#x27;t live without it! I have used it for flu, colds, congestion, to freshen the air and to kill bacteria in motel/hotel rooms when we travel, also have used it when I had shingles on the left side of my face.  I have used it in hot steam for the grandkids when they were sick and sprayed the room where they were sleeping when they coughed through the night, and it works wonders for cold sores.  If you rub it on right when you feel it tingling through the skin, and then some lip balm to keep it from evaporating, it will be gone the next morning and will not erupt!  If it has already erupted, it will halt it from getting worse.  I have given away so many bottles and recommended it to so many people, so I always make sure I have at lease one full bottle or two all year long.  It&#x27;s pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it to see people you care about get relief from their ailments without prescription drugs.  And I&#x27;ve tried other brands from the health stores when they were out of Arbor Oil brand, but it&#x27;s just not the same quality and pureness.  You can smell the difference and there is no color and it comes in a clear glass spray bottle so it&#x27;s so handy to use and you can see it it gets low so I can order more.  It&#x27;s a must to have for anyone!</li>
    <li> I spray these on my pillow and in the air as a relaxant. It smells great but it only lasts for a short while.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb.  The sprayer is fine enough to give a great mist and the eucalyptus really helps open the&lt;br /&gt;bronchial passages.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find anywhere except Amazon.  Love You Amazon</li>
    <li> This is good stuff! I use it as bathroom spray. It works very well eliminating odors and gives the room a clean , fresh smell!</li>
    <li> It sure helps with colds and allergies</li>
    <li> I had to return this spray oil because the scent was a little too concentrated for my taste.  Eucalyptus has a strong scent to begin with.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years after coming across it at a Health Expo. It&#x27;s potency lasts for a long time and I keep this in my personal medicinal arsenal it is excellent.</li>
    <li> Helps clear the sinuses during cold and allergy seasons.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never tried this, you should!  It&#x27;s wonderful to spray in the shower or a steam room...&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it!</li>
