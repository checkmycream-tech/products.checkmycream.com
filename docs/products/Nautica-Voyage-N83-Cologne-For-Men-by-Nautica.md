      <li>but my lady thinks its just ok</li>
      <li>Love the smell of this cologne.</li>
      <li>Nautica Voyage N-83 Eau de Toilette Spray, 3.4 Ounce sells for 50% more, gift wrapped by Amazon for around $22 which is not a cologne, it is Eau de Toilette.</li>
      <li>and I was not disappointed!</li>
      <li>Smell nice and refreshing and very favorable price</li>
      <li>Not too strong and overpowering.</li>
      <li>I would not recommend this cologne, it&#x27;s cheap and it also smells cheap.</li>
      <li>Both are great buys especially considering any Voyage sells for $63 at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Nautica stold all of the nice scents from Nightflight and added their own citrus to it taking it to the next level.</li>
      <li>Worth the price!</li>
      <li>Once was good enough for N-83.</li>
      <li>Not as sweet smelling as the NAUTICA Voyage which I also like.</li>
      <li>Got this for a gift, new package and authentic.</li>
      <li>Worth the expense.</li>
      <li>so I know this one is on the right track.</li>
      <li>Got this for my husband as a gift without smelling it first</li>
      <li>First spray got me my first compliment</li>
      <li>It lasts only about 4 or 5 hours but that just means I get to spray more on.</li>
      <li>you cant go wrong with nautica products not to strong nice and light</li>
      <li>He absolutely adores this fragrance.</li>
      <li>I really like it a lot, and it&#x27;s deserves 5 stars in my eyes.</li>
      <li>My wife likes it so that&#x27;s really all that matters here.</li>
      <li>The price on Amazon is reasonable and the shipping is fast.</li>
      <li>No third party sellers, only Macy&#x27;s or Amazon gift wrap are the sellers I trust for either Voyage cologne or Eau de Toilette which invigorates rush to rouse the mind and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a long lasting smell, read the information provided in the comment section but regardless of the brand the smell has to be good.</li>
      <li>I am sticking to the beast Voyager, the high selling, the regular Voyager.</li>
      <li>the regular Nautica is so clean and long lasting, I spray all the time especially before my workouts and the smell stays on my clothes even till next day in my laundry basket.</li>
      <li>I have only used it for my bathroom so far...</li>

<li> It doesn&#x27;t last long in the cold since it is an aquatic scent.</li>
<li> It won&#x27;t overpower the senses of people standing next to you and leave them dazed!</li>
<li> Not good</li>

    <li> My girlfriend loves this on me. Its a very nice scent. Not too strong and overpowering. It has a distance of about 4 feet on me. It lasts only about 4 or 5 hours but that just means I get to spray more on. At $20, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>

    <li> If you like Joop Nightflight this will be for you. Nautica stold all of the nice scents from Nightflight and added their own citrus to it taking it to the next level. First spray got me my first compliment so I know this one is on the right track.</li>

    <li> Great scent.  I had bought the body spray at an outlet mall.  The same bottle of cologne was $68.  I am completely satisfied with this seller and will be spreading the word!</li>
    <li> Voyage Cologne by Nautica for men sold by Amazon is a great cologne which has been selling for around $16 for years and years. Nautica Voyage N-83 Eau de Toilette Spray, 3.4 Ounce sells for 50% more, gift wrapped by Amazon for around $22 which is not a cologne, it is Eau de Toilette. Both are great buys especially considering any Voyage sells for $63 at Macy&#x27;s. the regular Nautica is so clean and long lasting, I spray all the time especially before my workouts and the smell stays on my clothes even till next day in my laundry basket. At Macy&#x27;s I could get a free bag which is a beautiful bag for the beach but one is plenty enough for me. No third party sellers, only Macy&#x27;s or Amazon gift wrap are the sellers I trust for either Voyage cologne or Eau de Toilette which invigorates rush to rouse the mind and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a long lasting smell, read the information provided in the comment section but regardless of the brand the smell has to be good.

    <li> This was a birthday present for my nephew. He absolutely adores this fragrance. I could not find it in the stores. I found it on amazon and screamed. This is his favorite. I will be reordering for his birthday present next year!!</li>
    <li> Original product, smells good</li>
    <li> Has a mild but pleasant smell! I like using it especially as it isn&#x27;t overpowering and pungent like some EdT sprays out there. It won&#x27;t overpower the senses of people standing next to you and leave them dazed! I really like it a lot, and it&#x27;s deserves 5 stars in my eyes.</li>
    <li> I like it but my lady thinks its just ok</li>
