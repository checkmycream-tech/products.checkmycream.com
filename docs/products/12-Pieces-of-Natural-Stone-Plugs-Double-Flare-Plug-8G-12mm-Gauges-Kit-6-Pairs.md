### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>These are very beautiful.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall this set is awesome!</li>
      <li>Very beautiful, good stone gauges!</li>
      <li>Excellent colors and great price.  </li>
      <li>Either way beautiful earrings.</li>
      <li>Very cute!</li>
      <li>All the pieces arrived in great condition except one of the Tiger Eye pieces.</li>
      <li>but all in all great buy for the quantity of gauges.</li>
      <li>These earrings are very nice looking in person and closely resemble the picture.</li>
      <li>5 out of the 6 pairs looked awesome but the 6th pair were supposed to be a purple color (which of course is my favorite color)</li>
      <li>I love all the varieties!</li>
      <li>He was SO excited by the quality of the stone and the variety - it was an amazing deal and the stones are really beautiful and eye-catching.</li>
      <li>Fit great.</li>
      <li>-out discomfort aside, they look very nice, and are easy to clean.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s probably safe to say they aren&#x27;t stone</li>
      <li>, I got 0 gauges and they fit nice.</li>
      <li>so I had to wait when I moved up to a 0 to be able to wear all of them.</li>
      <li>Pretty nice gauges</li>
      <li>All mine came in tact and quickly and the opliate and tigerseye are really stunning.</li>
      <li>Received these items quickly and they are absolutely gorgeous and high quality!</li>
      <li>Nice assortment for the price, do not believe these are real stone</li>
      <li>Such a great deal for guages.</li>
      <li>Love these but the striped multi colored stone could have been matched better one is beautiful with all colors and the other has no green at all and is just pink and orange, other than that they&#x27;re awesome and a great buy</li>
      <li>I was really excited to get this set until it came in.</li>
      <li>Worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth it though.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping though!</li>
      <li>All of these plugs look exactly like they do in the picture.</li>
      <li>Knocked off a star since I&#x27;m not sure if they are all real stone but a great deal regardless for a large set.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend is a professional piercer and I was looking for something unique for Christmas.</li>
      <li>Regardless they are very pretty and the size 0g seems accurate and the flares were not too large, though they seem to be on the larger end of 0g.</li>
      <li>and there&#x27;s multiple sets available</li>
      <li>so I really wanted that set.</li>
      <li>Inconsistently sized flanges, most being a touch bigger than standard.</li>
      <li>And of course, if your ear lobes aren&#x27;t super stretchy: don&#x27;t buy double flares.</li>
      <li>High quality plugs</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like a clear green than an opal.</li>
      <li>That being said they were a slight bigger fit but not by very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They seem a little cheap</li>
      <li>I thought I&#x27;d be able to get them in after a shower but the flare is at least a size higher than the center of the plug.</li>
      <li>By pure observation, you can tell some of these are not real stone.</li>
      <li>Overall not a bad purchase for the price but beware missing sets and it not appearing like the picture</li>
      <li>One of my pairs was broken and one pair is smaller than the others, but otherwise I&#x27;m pleased with them</li>

<li> but I expected that</li>
<li> These can be pretty hard and uncomfortable to pop in and out when your ears (or other fleshy bits, I guess) are used to standard</li>
<li> but I notched down to four star rating because of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It was shaved down on one side but maybe still usable.</li>
<li> Like others have mentioned the saddle is a little big on these, if you&#x27;ve had some earrings in or don&#x27;t sleep with earrings in these might be hard to get in, but they didn&#x27;t make my ears bleed or anything.</li>
<li> Sizes may vary a little bit.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
<li> there were very few consistencies</li>
<li> It is completely missing the amethyst set and the Opal is disappointing.  </li>

    <li> Received these items quickly and they are absolutely gorgeous and high quality!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend is a professional piercer and I was looking for something unique for Christmas. He was SO excited by the quality of the stone and the variety - it was an amazing deal and the stones are really beautiful and eye-catching. He loves it. Fit great.</li>
    <li> Love these but the striped multi colored stone could have been matched better one is beautiful with all colors and the other has no green at all and is just pink and orange, other than that they&#x27;re awesome and a great buy</li>
    <li> All of these plugs look exactly like they do in the picture. They are some of my favorites now</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my step sister. All the pieces arrived in great condition except one of the Tiger Eye pieces. It was shaved down on one side but maybe still usable. Would have been a five star rating but I notched down to four star rating because of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are stone so they have no give when trying to put in! That being said they were a slight bigger fit but not by very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this set is awesome! Very beautiful, good stone gauges!</li>
    <li> Very cute! Such a great deal for guages. I love all the varieties! They seem a little cheap but I expected that and it doesn&#x27;t even matter cuz no one can tell in ur ears.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the tapers vary in size so I had to wait when I moved up to a 0 to be able to wear all of them.</li>
    <li> Nice assortment for the price, do not believe these are real stone however, esp the purple and rainbow ones. Regardless they are very pretty and the size 0g seems accurate and the flares were not too large, though they seem to be on the larger end of 0g. All mine came in tact and quickly and the opliate and tigerseye are really stunning. Knocked off a star since I&#x27;m not sure if they are all real stone but a great deal regardless for a large set.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this set until it came in. It is completely missing the amethyst set and the Opal is disappointing.  It&#x27;s more like a clear green than an opal. That&#x27;s my birthstone so I really wanted that set. Overall not a bad purchase for the price but beware missing sets and it not appearing like the picture</li>
    <li> Inconsistently sized flanges, most being a touch bigger than standard. These can be pretty hard and uncomfortable to pop in and out when your ears (or other fleshy bits, I guess) are used to standard plugs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Change-out discomfort aside, they look very nice, and are easy to clean.</li>
    <li> These are very beautiful. Worth the purchase. Sizes may vary a little bit. Definitely worth it though.</li>
    <li> One of my pairs was broken and one pair is smaller than the others, but otherwise I&#x27;m pleased with them</li>
    <li> Excellent colors and great price.  High quality plugs</li>
    <li> By pure observation, you can tell some of these are not real stone. And of course, if your ear lobes aren&#x27;t super stretchy: don&#x27;t buy double flares. I thought I&#x27;d be able to get them in after a shower but the flare is at least a size higher than the center of the plug. Fast shipping though!</li>
    <li> These earrings are very nice looking in person and closely resemble the picture. Like others have mentioned the saddle is a little big on these, if you&#x27;ve had some earrings in or don&#x27;t sleep with earrings in these might be hard to get in, but they didn&#x27;t make my ears bleed or anything. Because they&#x27;re so close to the picture and there&#x27;s multiple sets available it&#x27;s probably safe to say they aren&#x27;t stone but maybe glass? Either way beautiful earrings.</li>
    <li> So these arrived on time, but only one pair made it in one piece. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> Pretty nice gauges, I got 0 gauges and they fit nice. They do fall out when I sleep so I took a star for that reason. 5 out of the 6 pairs looked awesome but the 6th pair were supposed to be a purple color (which of course is my favorite color) but it came with a dark purple one and the other was practically clear so they don&#x27;t match, which is why I took another star off.... but all in all great buy for the quantity of gauges.</li>
    <li> there were very few consistencies</li>
