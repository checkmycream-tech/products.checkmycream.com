      <li>I love this cream.</li>
      <li>The Lot of 4 was a great price and delivery was fast.</li>
      <li>I love this firming cream.  </li>

      <li>i really like the product.</li>

      <li>but like all creams be reasonable about expectations.</li>
      <li>Smells good,gives your skin a nice firm feeling while making it glow</li>
      <li>like I said I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that permanent, but it does work, especially if put on between uses of other firming, tightening or wrinkle removing creams, I definitely recommend this, works great on your body</li>
      <li>90 years old and not a wrinkle on my face.</li>
      <li>Ok, the results from this stuff aren&#x27;t to permanent, but I DO NOT use it as a face cream, for that I have something else, with this dramatic firming cream I put it on my whole body and problem areas</li>

<li> Not sure it does what they claim, wont be ordering anymore</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is authentic.  They don&#x27;t come sealed like Avon sends them. I Planned on returning them but never got around to it.  Each jar I open smells looks and feels a little different.  I fear this is a rip off.</li>
