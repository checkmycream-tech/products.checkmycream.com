<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Best comb you can find on amazon.</li>
    <li> Well made and good looking product. Purchased one of these years ago when I was in Europe andf the airline lost my luggage. Was not able to find it here in the states so I am happy with this piurchase.</li>
    <li> Like the style and feel.  For me not as massive an improvement over cheapo combs but is an improvement.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> no seams, no sharp edges, doesn&#x27;t pull, poke nor  hold dirt, oil and product. the  perfect comb. seems strudy -- rides in my back pocket just fine and I&#x27;m not light.</li>
    <li> Beautiful comb.  Good quality too</li>
    <li> Works very well. Smooth teeth and sturdy.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent comb for those with short cropped thin hair, or thinning hairline. It feels good on the scalp and is just the right size to carry in a suit or pants pocket.</li>
    <li> Agree 100 pct with the amazing reviews.. It&#x27;s what a comb should be, not a hard plastic scratching machine, breakable Any moment..&lt;br /&gt;Perfect size for back pocket and amazing how heavy it feels.. BEST Comb ever!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really believe a comb could make that much a difference until I purchased this comb. It doesn&#x27;t scratch your head or pull your hair like the cheap Ace comb i was using before. Stylish and actually useful, I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I got this comb for my dad to replace his old one he had for about 40 years, and he said that it is like the one he had before, he love the comb. It feel great in his pocket and it has the great feel when he comb his hair.</li>
    <li> Like all Kent products, great quality.  Delivery was prompt without incident.  My favorite comb.  No probelm with purchase or delivery.  Now if I could just stop losing them</li>
    <li> Great comb. Its a much sturdier quality then a cheap plastic one from the drugstore. I keep it in my back pocket all the time and its not bulky at all</li>
    <li> My only gripe is that the &amp;#34;KENT&amp;#34; logo on the middle off the comb wore off easily. I&#x27;d buy it again though.</li>
    <li> Great simple comb. Very smooth. Everything you want in a comb and nothing else.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite comb EVER. I&#x27;ve always used cheap pieces of crap from the drug store for years. I have no idea why I originally wanted one. I like nice things and I think I may have bought into the whole &#x27;oh, this is handmade and handmade means its better&#x27; bullsh*t but honestly I really like this comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I covet it and pet it while no one is looking. I take it for long drives to see the country side and for walks on the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a name, its Combie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The courthouse has denied mine and &#x27;Combie&#x27;s&#x27; marriage certificate twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to purchase another soon.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these. They are as good as their reputation, vastly better than the cheap drugstore versions that are available. Now I just have to be careful not to lose them.</li>
    <li> Seriously the greatest comb ever made. Feels sturdy and smooth and goes through your hair like butter. Not that it leaves butter in your hair or anything, because that would be weird and gross.</li>
    <li> This is a very sturdy and fine comb. It came on the second day of the estimate. It&#x27;s great i love it.</li>
    <li> Nice comb, not much else to say</li>
    <li> good size for travel bag - love the quality because they do not scratch and have a good balance/grip in hand</li>
    <li> I also purchased the smaller pocket comb, so this one says in my bathroom drawer and I use it every day.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s a bit longer than a pocket comb.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband. He really likes it and says that it feels great on his scalp and is a joy to comb with. Kent hair products are great! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Nice comb until it broke in half. Lasted about a month.</li>
    <li> Combs aren’t anything to get to excited about but I do have to admit I was a little impressed.  I think there handmade claim is a bit of a stretch but the craftsmanship was good.  The polymer they used is hard with very little flex which not everyone may be a fan of but I am sold. I pomade and find the comb is easy to clean and I find it glides comfortably across my scalp.  If you are looking for a comb to replace that freebie you got for a photo shoot I would I highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Top notch quality comb. A little pricey but should last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> love it very smooth ,  there is no pulling of the hair</li>
    <li> This is a high quality comb and will probably out live me. I use it every day and have bought some as gifts. The teeth are great for fine hair and do not bend. I even take mine with me whenever I travel and it still looks brand new.</li>
    <li> I fancy myself a comb connoisseur especially as I like to get the pomp look in my hair. Solid quality and feel. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I would have given 5 star if it costs only $3 - 4.  This is good comb but I dont&#x27; see anything special to pay eight dollars. I had to buy this only as I couldn&#x27;t buy another good comb in Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see any difference between this and similar $ 3/4 comb I bought sometime ago in local shop.</li>
    <li> This is a very well made comb. It doesn&#x27;t have sharp edges or points to scratch your scalp. The comb is saw cut, with smooth surfaces on the teeth, so it glides smoothly through your hair, without catching. It&#x27;s a convenient size too.</li>
    <li> Solid construction, usual high quality expected from Kent.  What can I say?  It&#x27;s a comb and it does its job.</li>
    <li> Better than the cheap combs at walmart</li>
    <li> These are a pleasure to use every time I take one out of my pocket.  Yes, it&#x27;s more expensive than a drug-store comb, but it&#x27;s one of those nice things that&#x27;s a joy to own.</li>
    <li> The comb is sturdy and smooth (it doesn&#x27;t scratch my scalp like another comb I recently tried).  BUT, the teeth are too big and don&#x27;t grab onto the hair.  When parting my hair I have to try several times to complete the operation.  I don&#x27;t expect I&#x27;ll waste time every time I comb my hair much longer, as this Kent comb will end up in the garbage soon. I didn&#x27;t return it because I don&#x27;t want to be bothered. The no name cheap comb with missing teeth I&#x27;ve had for decades is still the best. I won&#x27;t buy Kent again.</li>
    <li> Top quality comb, no sharp points to dig into your scalp. Tha best</li>
    <li> Most amazing comb you could ever buy for a beard</li>
    <li> Worth it.  Grocery store combs are junk.  This comb doesn&#x27;t scratch my scalp or catch in my hair.  It actually feels good!  Also doesn&#x27;t have the irritating two sizes to deal with, just one useful medium/fine pitch.  Perfect for a person with short hair and little patience for messing with it (like me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model is on the smaller side.  143mm (for those us us who don&#x27;t use metric daily) is a bit over 5 inches.  It&#x27;s also slim.  Good for short to medium hair, probably wouldn&#x27;t keep up with long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ditch the Ace, Unbreakable, junky sharp combs and try this when you&#x27;re ready to spend $10 on a good comb.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t expect much from a comb, but this was better than expected. I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my husband, who keeps breaking &amp;#34;unbreakable&amp;#34; combs. I decided to try it myself to see if it was worth the price. I have waist-length hair, and this ran through much smoother than the cheaper combs and did not create static. It also felt a lot smoother in the hand with no sharp points. Color me impressed! The only thing that disappointed me was the look. The picture shows a faux tortoiseshell and this was just a rather blah looking solid brown comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also a bit large for a pocket comb. It is almost 6&amp;#34; long and will stick out a good inch from his pants pocket. I didn&#x27;t deduct for that because I read the description and converted mm to inches before buying. The 113mm is just a little too small and this 143mm is just a little too long. I wound up buying an old school black comb for his pocket and will keep this one for home. Or, it might just magically wind up in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit--I recently bought another to keep in my purse. I should have inspected it before I threw it into my purse because it is not the same quality. The second comb had a few rough tips and a small chunk of plastic that is holding two teeth together and causing knots in my hair. I removed a star because of it. This one does have the faux tortoiseshell stripes instead of a solid brown, but the stripes are an ugly brown/gray color. The comb is pretty useless, so I would strongly advise people to inspect their combs as soon as they get them and not rely on the manufacturer&#x27;s quality control.</li>
    <li> I too used only cheap combs over the years.  I bought this model just on a whim, knowing that Kent is a good name.  WOW!  I can&#x27;t even describe the feeling, but the smooth, even pull through one&#x27;s hair is great!  The hand sawn teeth DO make a difference.  I am so glad I made this purchase, and will stick with Kent combs, when (and IF) this one ever gives out.</li>
    <li> The comb I received was defective. The spacings between the teeth were not uniform. There were two teeth that were too far apart than they should. Unacceptable for a $8 plastic comb.</li>
    <li> I have only used low quality combs until now. I&#x27;ll never go back. I&#x27;d say I&#x27;d order a few more, but there&#x27;s no need to. The durable craftsmanship is evident whether you&#x27;re just holding it, using it, or deliberately attempting to bend it. Easy on the scalp. Looks cool. Buy it already.</li>
    <li> I did not received the comb in the picture. The Kent logo was different, the lettering rubbed off, and the color wasn&#x27;t even close.</li>
    <li> great comb..best ever</li>
    <li> I bought this very nice comb for a man at Christmas. [[ASIN:B000YB1XRO Kent Hand-Made 113mm All Fine Pocket Comb - FOT]]    He liked it and was impressed with the quality.</li>
    <li> The Gold lettering rubbs off while in my pocket (no comb holder) Looks classy and bristles don&#x27;t bend out of place. I would want to pay $4 for the brush so I took off one star.</li>
    <li> I own several Kent combs and this one is a nice as the others.  Small enough to fit in your back pocket.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Comb is very solidly built &amp; works well with a corse beard.</li>
    <li> My Beard Is Very Happy. This Is Truly A Supreme Comb. I Will Be Ordering A Smaller One As Well. This One Is Perfect.</li>
    <li> I would recommend these combs to anyone with fine hair.  The combs are good looking and last without breaking.  This pocket comb is a little bigger than the FOT pocket comb.  Probably better suited to a female.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price; worked perfectly. Recommend.</li>
    <li> These are very high quality combs. And for the price, they&#x27;re the bargain of the century. Cheap rubber combs get nasty, break teeth, warp. These combs are easy to clean, stay nice and hard, straight, and the teeth don&#x27;t just fall out for no reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say I will always buy these, but really, I probably never will need to buy another unless I lose it.</li>
    <li> This is a very smooth durable comb that is hard to find anywhere else.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product.</li>
    <li> This is a well made pocket comb. Nothing fancy, just well made for general uses.</li>
    <li> I always have a kent comb on me.  Have tried all sizes.  My wife managed to break one, not sure how, because these have lasted me years and i havent had any issues with bent or missing teeth.  I have thick hair, and I like the all fine teeth.  I dont have to worry about using only one side of the comb.  The dressing or styling combs are great, but the pocket sized kents do the job and are easy to carry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks nice, works great, its hard to mess up a comb but when you compare this to a dollar store comb, it doesnt scratch your scalp, it lasts a long time, the teeth stay straight and its easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Quality all around. By far the best brand in combs.  No moulding lines the catch on, no sharp edges.  The difference is amazing.</li>
    <li> Just a great comb.  Bought one years ago and couldnt find them until Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Try one of these combs and you will have them in your toilet bag for life</li>
    <li> After reading the &amp;#34;Combie&amp;#34; review, I couldn&#x27;t not buy this comb. I don&#x27;t think my boyfriend will leave me for it anytime soon (I hope) but he loves it nonetheless</li>
    <li> While the fellas were waxing romantic about this little comb, I was reading and giggling, until I GOT mine.This one fits into my tiny purse/wristlet (men just read on) and so I can comb my hair in the ladies room. He snatched the first one, so I bought another. He sports a moustache and a beard in winter (I dunno?) and he LOVES his little comb! It was hysterical! Last year for Christmas he asked for $500.00 worth of outdoor gear to keep him warm and toasty on days he had to work in awful weather, this year he got the comb for Valentine&#x27;s day and I assure you, He practically cried in delight about the comb. The other stuff, not so much.</li>
    <li> The 143mm is a good length for a pocket comb.  The next on down in length is a bit small for an adult man.</li>
    <li> This comb is very sturdy, very well built. Craftsmanship is superb.&lt;br /&gt;This Product is worth your money, A buy it for life product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I expected this comb to be slightly better than the drug store combs that I have been using but this comb blew my exceptions out of the water. It makes styling and shaping my hair much easier and I get the style I want.  Buy this comb!&lt;br /&gt;FIY: I have thick wavy hair and use pomade.</li>
    <li> Unlike virtually all other combs, which are molded from plastic, Kent combs are handmade. The manufacturing process begins with a blank piece of high grade plastic from which craftsmen hand cut each comb with a saw, which is then polished to a smooth finish. The resulting comb has a quality feel, pulls smoothly through your hair/beard, and the teeth feel comfortable rubbing against your scalp. In my opinion, the 143mm all fine pocket comb is the best all around pocket comb that Kent offers with only fine teeth. If you are looking for a similar pocket comb with both coarse and fine teeth, I recommend the Kent R7T (link: [[ASIN:B000YB70PS Kent The Handmade Comb - 143 mm Fine and Coarse Toothed Pocket Comb Sawcut R7T]]). The company (G B Kent &amp;amp; Sons Ltd) has been manufacturers of brushes since the eighteenth century and is one of the oldest established companies in Great Britain. It has royal warrants as &amp;quot;Best British Brushes&amp;quot; from every British monarch going back to George III. Considering its quality and heritage, this comb is an exceptional value. Treat yourself to the best!</li>
    <li> I was sad at first to discover that the manufacturing of Ace pocket combs had been transferred to a crap factory in China that puked out terrible hard plastic junk, but in doing so I have discovered the best pocket comb I have ever owned. A great deal of research resulted in me trying several different products, and all but one (Kent) was a huge disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;  I sincerely believe my head is the best head ever, and the hair I have left is the best hair ever, and I will never again pass anything through my locks except a Kent hand made comb that is definitely the BEST EVER.</li>
    <li> not exactly what I wanted but thanks</li>
    <li> Handsome, solid little comb. This thing definitely beats out my old flimsy black plastic comb. One solid piece, and doesn&#x27;t have a seam down the middle.</li>
    <li> Kent are the gold-standard of combs. Great quality for years of use. The tines aren&#x27;t pokey, the weight feels good. Runs through hair like a breeze.</li>
    <li> this is a strong comb like the other reviews says it does not Poke your head and you can tell and feel that it will last very long.</li>
    <li> My husband has high expectations, therefore can be hard to please.  The comb he replaced, he had for 25+ years!  Other combs we tried he immediately didn&#x27;t like.  With the Kent Hand - Made comb - he immediately loved it!  That says a lot.  Am sure IF he ever needs to replace a comb again, it will be Kent Hade- Made!</li>
    <li> It probably doesn&#x27;t seem like a big deal to many people but these combs are the best. I have one for my mustache/beard and also a medium sized one for my head. The teeth are rounded so no worrying about poking your head. Although on ones I&#x27;ve had for a longer amount of time the gold lettering does fade after a few years but overall the comb is usable indefinitely. I would definitely suggest trying this out if you&#x27;ve got a few extra bucks. It is a great product.</li>
    <li> Your hair will thank you for buying KENT combs. They&#x27;re handmade and saw-cut and the teeth are super sturdy which makes it really easy to comb through your hair. I am never going back to the cheap combs you would find at a pharmacy or something.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. Lost my first one and bought it again.</li>
    <li> The perfect pocket comb for fine to medium thickness hair.</li>
    <li> Love the look of this comb first off. Beyond that though it is a quality piece of craftsmanship. Sturdy and smooth, feels good running it over your scalp. The size is good too. I could maybe use a bigger comb as well but this one for me is a great all around size.</li>
    <li> A perfect compliment to the hairbrush. Excellent quality and exactly what I was looking for. I highly recommend this comb.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of these combs. They&#x27;re made really well and I love the look. I carry around the pocket comb wherever I go. These make great gifts, especially for groomsmen. This will be the comb you pass on to your children.</li>
    <li> a little bit on the smaller side I purchases this for a comb that I will keep at home wish it was about an inch longer but that&#x27;s my fault for ordering the smaller one overall great comb if you&#x27;re on the fence about it just buy it you&#x27;ll be happy</li>
    <li> This comb is easily the nicest I&#x27;ve ever owned, and it should be, considering the price. If you want a smooth, well-made tool that will do its job properly and comfortably, go ahead and indulge yourself. You won&#x27;t regret the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of notes:&lt;br /&gt;(1) I have hair of average thickness. The fine-toothed comb is almost too fine for my hair. If you&#x27;ve ever considered yourself to have thicker follicles or lots of volume, I would encourage you to look for a Kent medium comb.&lt;br /&gt;(2) The gold lettering on the handle of my comb is quickly wearing off. I thought the lettering detracted from the elegance of the acetate anyway, so I&#x27;m not concerned about this, but you may be.&lt;br /&gt;(3) There is a risk to owning this product: Your significant other may accuse you of having gone &#x27;hipster&#x27; when she finds out how much the comb cost.</li>
    <li> I bought this comb on amazon for my husband and loves it. The comb is really nicely made, smooth, and easy to use. Its definitely better than your typical drugstore comb. I am buying 2 more!</li>
