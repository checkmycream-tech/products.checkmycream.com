      <li>A dear friend gave it as a gift to me many years ago</li>
      <li>HAD PURCHASED THE FIRST TALC IN MEXICO AND HAD LOVED IT.</li>

      <li>and it wasn&#x27;t available in the states.  </li>
      <li>Love Maja, when I first had the product my husband brought it to me from Spain</li>
      <li>Your service was super.</li>
      <li>THE CANISTER IS NOT AS COLORFUL AS THE OLD ORIGINAL.</li>
      <li>It was rough feeling and the scent was not as nice.  </li>

      <li>I just have to keep my husband out of my supply because he wants to wear this too.</li>
      <li>Really.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
      <li>This was more than natural settlement of the product and combined with the different appearance, it made me think that the product was not new although it was sold as such.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t think I can find it in a local store anymore.</li>
      <li>It does not have the same scent as the older Maja powder.  </li>
      <li>Having searched for this product in the UK for some time for my mother-in-law I gave up and purchased from a US company; this resulted in having to pay 3 times what the product was worth in postage even though it weighed so little.</li>

<li> Slightly musky and floral, but not at all overpowering.</li>
<li> I received in just a few days.</li>

<li> So sad we can not purchase at our drugstore&#x27;s here anymore.</li>
<li> I wonder if it was a fake?  </li>
<li> I was very disappointed is this powder.  </li>

    <li> MYRURGIA MAJA FOR WOMEN.  PERFUMED TALC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HAD PURCHASED THE FIRST TALC IN MEXICO AND HAD LOVED IT. HOWEVER, I LET OVER 20 YEARS GO BY UNTIL I DECIDED I REALLY WANTED IT. SO HOW?? I AM HOUSE BOUND BUT I CAN USE INTERNET SO I DID A PRODUCT SEARCH AND SENT MY ORDER THROUGH AMAZON.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT WAS A REAL PLEASURE TO HAVE THIS TALC AGAIN. THE CANISTER IS NOT AS COLORFUL AS THE OLD ORIGINAL. BUT THE GIFT BOX TALC IS GREAT.</li>
    <li> Love it. I wear the spray also.</li>
    <li> *** I can&#x27;t remember where I found this the first time - probably at a Marshall&#x27;s but I was hooked from the start. The fragrance is enchanting and lasts a long time, especially if I use the lotion with the powder. I&#x27;m depending on Amazon to make sure I can continue to get this. I really don&#x27;t think I can find it in a local store anymore. I just have to keep my husband out of my supply because he wants to wear this too. There&#x27;s nothing like this delicious fragrance at this price. Try it !</li>
    <li> Having searched for this product in the UK for some time for my mother-in-law I gave up and purchased from a US company; this resulted in having to pay 3 times what the product was worth in postage even though it weighed so little. It arrived promptly but the product did not appear as it had on the web page. The picture on the front was different. My mother in law was pleased as she had been looking for this talc for a long time. I was, however, disappointed to see when she held it up that it was only 3/4 full. This was more than natural settlement of the product and combined with the different appearance, it made me think that the product was not new although it was sold as such.</li>
    <li> Very nice aroma. Good price</li>
    <li> Love Maja, when I first had the product my husband brought it to me from Spain and it wasn&#x27;t available in the states.  I missed it for years cuz he didn&#x27;t go back as it was a military stop for him.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years. Nothing more needs to be said. fragrance of choice since I lived in Spain.</li>
    <li> This powder brings back memories from my childhood. I&#x27;m so glad I found it here and that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;hecho in Mexico&amp;#34;. Really. The writing on the container is in Spanish. It just makes it feel more authentic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the powder itself, it&#x27;s great! Slightly musky and floral, but not at all overpowering. And, it&#x27;s talc...no cornstarch in it. Beats baby powder!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was just as promised. Unfortunately, it isn&#x27;t a Prime product, but that&#x27;s ok. I received in just a few days.</li>
    <li> Thank-you Myrurgia for not letting me down. It was what I had ordered, and as advertised exactly what I needed. If I could subscribe to your products with a monthly fee I would gladly pay the difference to be able to purchase your products.</li>
    <li> Everyone you pass will say, Oh you must have just gotten out of the shower.&amp;#34;  Nope it&#x27;s the powder  So sad we can not purchase at our drugstore&#x27;s here anymore.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  This talc doesn&#x27;t smell like the tradition Maja, for some reason, but it is pleasant.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed is this powder.  It does not have the same scent as the older Maja powder.  This one has just an ordinary talcum odor</li>
    <li> The bottle looks different from the item pictured on Amazon.  The formula is also different.  It doesn&#x27;t seem as soft and silky as the original but the scent is the same, perhaps a bit less pronounced.  I just started using this bottle and will have to use it for a while to give a better opinion.</li>
    <li> A lovely scent with a silky smooth feel when applied.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  A dear friend gave it as a gift to me many years ago and I have been using it ever since.  Your service was super.</li>
    <li> My wife was looking for this powder..found it here she is happy!!....arrived sooner than expected....would definately buy again...no problems at all.</li>
    <li> This is not an overwhelming product but a nice long lasting gentle fragrence that will work well in an office.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product for years, but when I got it in the 7 oz. bottle, it did not smell or feel like the same product.  It was rough feeling and the scent was not as nice.  I wonder if it was a fake?  Considering that this offering is so less costly than the other offerings of the boxed version, I&#x27;d be careful.</li>
