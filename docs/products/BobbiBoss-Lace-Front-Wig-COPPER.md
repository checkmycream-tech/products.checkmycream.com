    <li> Love this hair I have been wearing for a month now.</li>
    <li> Great wig.  No tangles or shedding</li>
    <li> This unit right here is absolutely amazing!! I was skeptical as most people are especially when buying a wig you haven&#x27;t tried on before! I am blown away at the quality of this hair and the REALNESS of it. I am a new wig wearer and was looking for something chic and natural and this fits the bill! It is safe for heat styling and great for every day wear. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on this wig I am definitely going to buy it again and possibly in other colors. I hope this does not go out of stock because I KNOW I will be wearing this one for a long time. The cut is super cute what more can I say?? If you are wondering whether or not this will be worth the buy worry no more. This one is the truth! Looks just like the one in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Safe for flat ironing&lt;br /&gt;- Great for long lasting wear&lt;br /&gt;- Has combs inside for securing on head&lt;br /&gt;- Adjustable straps&lt;br /&gt;- Natural hair line&lt;br /&gt;- JUST FAB!!!</li>
    <li> Not happy...it looked to fake!</li>
    <li> I purchased this in 2015-16 and LOVED it.  However, the manufacturer has  diminished the quality.  If you do decided to purchase this wig, open the package immediately, inspect, and determine if it is what you want.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Get this wig!!! The hair looks exactly like relaxed African American hair. It has a low luster so as not to appear to &amp;#34;wiggy&amp;#34;. I am always baffled when i see people walking around with these wigs that are like shiny helmets. .. absolutely no one believes that grew out of your head. This wig however, will definitely get mistaken as your real hair. It is very natural and chic and stylish. Trust me...you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love it! Gotten so many compliments since I started using it.</li>
    <li> It doesnt look anything like this when i put it on. Disappointed i really like Bobbi Boss.</li>
    <li> This unit is thick and full of body. It such an amazing wig. I love it so much. The texture is awesome. I ordered the colors 1140 and 99J and OMG they&#x27;re so beautiful. You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This wigs looks and feels like real hair. I needed a break from doing my hair and want something easy. You can also curl this wig.  Very natural looking. For for women who loves wigs and want something that looks more realistic, this is a great wig for you.</li>
    <li> All I can say was it was just stunning! !</li>
