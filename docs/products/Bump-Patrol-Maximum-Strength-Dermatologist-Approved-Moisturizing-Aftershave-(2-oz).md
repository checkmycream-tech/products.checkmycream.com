      <li>Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried many after shave gels or lotions to help with razor bumps and none came close to this product.</li>
      <li>Works like magic in my opinion.</li>
      <li>still it worked better (I thought).</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve dealt with more ingrown hairs with this version of the product.</li>
      <li>Love It.</li>
      <li>Is it better than most products ...absolutely.</li>
      <li>This product takes care of the ingrown hair problem that causes razor bumps and cleared mine right up as well as moisturizes and smells good.</li>
      <li>This is pretty good stuff.</li>
      <li>It honestly worked the very first time I used it.  </li>
      <li>I can honestly say that for me the results after using this product were positive.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even know how I stumbled upon this, but it works fabulously.</li>
      <li>seems even more effective in preventing and minimizing bumps or inflammation post shave than the regular formula was (which already was better than anything else</li>
      <li>Overall the price is great</li>
      <li>Now my head is smooth as a baby&#x27;s ......</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several lotions and didn&#x27;t seem to work that great.</li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>We have tried many different products over the years and this seems to be a good one.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Now when I shave my head the skin is squeeky clean smooth with zero irritation,</li>
      <li>Used for past 5 years band my skin is as smooth as a babies boittom!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Always use a clean razor.</li>
      <li>I decided to purchase this product after hearing and reading so many positive comments concerning the effectiveness of its results.</li>
      <li>The extra strength has a better texture than the regular and smells more pleasant AND dries quicker.</li>
      <li>I have found that shaving daily (before the hair can curl back into the skin) combined with applying this immediately after shaving works best.</li>
      <li>Just dribble a dab in the palm of your hand and slap it on your skin quickly distributing throughout the desired area.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty good product, its definitely been enhanced compared to the original one.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this stuff,,, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please</li>
      <li>I noticed the difference on the very first application.</li>
      <li>Have tried other products and all the Bump Patrol formulations, this is by far the best.</li>
      <li>This max bump patrol really does the job and the clean smooth faces in my house</li>
      <li>I bought this for my husband, he really likes it!!</li>
      <li>His head is perfectly smooth and irritation-free, so I readily heeded his advice.  </li>
      <li>have to use it more frequently.</li>
      <li>You need this, and your skin is worth it.</li>
      <li>do want to mention that this is a clear liquid - more like an aftershave and not a lotion which I thought it was when I bought it.  </li>
      <li>However I dont really see much of a change, bumps and blemishes worked better</li>
      <li>really clear up my ingrown hair problem on the back of my head, especially right at the hook of my bald head (making to many passes with the razor).</li>
      <li>For some reason this version isn&#x27;t as strong as their normal version.</li>
      <li>This one on the other hand worked really good.</li>
      <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried this product, I suggest you start right away.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and get irritated easily.</li>
      <li>but I am glad I got duped as this extra strength formulation</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s funny because I bought it for my head</li>
      <li>I feel the regular strength works better.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Multiple blade razors work by gripping the hair, pulling it out of the skin and slicing it such that when the hair retracts, it is beneath the surface of the skin.  </li>
      <li>Maximum Strength formulation cured my problem after the first application.  </li>
      <li>When I first applied it, it stung a bit itself</li>
      <li>The regular bump patrol works much better.</li>
      <li>This does an okay job, but it does not give the &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; like regular bump-patrol to reassure you no bumps will form.</li>
      <li>I first bought this product at a pharmacy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Use hot water to prepare your skin.</li>
      <li>I incurred a lot of razor bumps within the first month that I started shaving with an electric razor.  </li>
      <li>Up under my nick, it dried them out where you able flex them out smoothly.</li>
      <li>This one is better because it is clear and smells okay where as the regular strength one is blue and stinky...</li>
      <li>It does dry out your skin so be sure to apply some lotion about 30min afterwards</li>
      <li>Tweeze, lather up, shave, pat dry, and then apply this magic.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There is no need to apply large amounts.  </li>
      <li>I was getting certain spots on my face that when I would run the trimmer over it, I would see stars.</li>
      <li>If you have a problem with bumps you HAVE to get the good razors and replace when they get dull.  </li>
      <li>this stuff really works.</li>
      <li>Works really fast in getting rid of unsightly razor bumps.  </li>
      <li>This product seems to work real well for him.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s helped me out so much</li>
      <li>I have given it to people, some in the military, to get their reaction and they love it too.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Had razor bumps 1 month later I have none what,else is there to say?</li>
    <li> This is a very good product, I have used it for over four years now and I have never ever regreted it.  I will always recommend this product to anyone who cares</li>
    <li> This stuff seems to get rid of the bumps in a matter of hours. Even though it&#x27;s extra strength, it hardly burns/stings even on nicked skin. I don&#x27;t have bump patrol products in my area so I will keep ordering from this seller.</li>
    <li> Worked better than I thought it would. I have very sensitive skin and get irritated easily. I&#x27;ve tried several lotions and didn&#x27;t seem to work that great. This one on the other hand worked really good. No razor burn of bump 5+ stars from me</li>
    <li> Didnt really work for me but for the price it wasn&#x27;t bad. In my case it actually made the bumps worse. I stopped using it. However some say it works so procceed with caution. Overall the price is great unfortunately it didn&#x27;t do the job</li>
    <li> This is works wonders for keeping bumps off of your bikini line after shaving. Personally, I like the regular formula better.</li>
    <li> I feel the regular strength works better. I&#x27;ve dealt with more ingrown hairs with this version of the product.</li>
    <li> Great stuff keeps ingrown hairs to a minimum.</li>
    <li> I would like to re-iterate the review that sold me on this; IT ACTUALLY WORKS! (And I normally don&#x27;t have luck with this stuff)</li>
    <li> I have been plagued with ingrown hairs at the nape of my neck for years.  Like clockwork, the painful, ugly bumps would show up within two days of shaving my neck.  Additionally, my occupation requires I use a stethoscope so I frequently sling it around my neck and this only intensifies the ingrown hair problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Caucasian, and while Bump Patrol seems to be marketed to men of African descent, it is only because black men typically have a higher incidence of ingrown hairs (pseudofolliculitis barbae). This is because of the fine, curly nature of black men&#x27;s hair. It more readily curls back into the skin and forms a painful bump.  That said, anyone can get an ingrown hair and those with curly hair (white or black)are more likely to be plagued with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I have decided to shave my head.  As a result, I developed multiple ingrown hairs, not only on my neck, but all along the back of my head.  It was a huge disappointment, and I expected I would not be able to continue with having my head shaved due to the unsightly and painful bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine, who was the inspiration to shave my head in the first place, recommended I pick up Bump Patrol found at the local Walmart. His head is perfectly smooth and irritation-free, so I readily heeded his advice.  I used it like any other aftershave and noticed improvement within three days (I shave my head daily).  However, I was still getting a few new ingrown hairs, so the Bump Patrol was not completely eliminating the problem.  In my research, I discovered on Bump Patrol&#x27;s website that they offer \\&quot;Original Strength\\&quot;, \\&quot;Maximum Strength\\&quot;, \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot;, and \\&quot;Extra Strength\\&quot;.  Walmart only had \\&quot;Original Strength\\&quot;, which in of itself is a good product, but it wasn&#x27;t perfect for my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered \\&quot;Extra Strength\\&quot; contains aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), while \\&quot;Maximum Strength\\&quot; contains aspirin and witch hazel. I could only find \\&quot;Maximum Strength\\&quot; online, so I bought a couple bottles from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Maximum Strength formulation cured my problem after the first application.  After a full week of daily use, there have been no ill effects. I am in awe of this product&#x27;s effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few hints for first-time users:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no need to apply large amounts.  If you do, your skin will feel sticky.  The consistency of the product out of the bottle is like that of gasoline.  If you apply it the way the manufacturer recommends, you cannot go wrong.  They discourage applying with cotton balls and the like, because you will only waste the product as the cotton will absorb most of it.  Just dribble a dab in the palm of your hand and slap it on your skin quickly distributing throughout the desired area. A dime-sized puddle is plenty for my entire meaty head. If you only have a limited area that is problematic for you, you can just spot-treat if desired. My friend just dabs it on his finger and traces it along his hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product stinging, that has not been my experience unless I have nicks and, of course, razor burn.  Otherwise, when you apply this to skin that has been nontraumatically shaven, the only sensation you will have is a soothing coolness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As per the included FAQ, you can apply your favorite moisturizer approximately 2 minutes after applying the Bump Patrol Maximum Strength without negating the effectiveness of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As should be the case for any similar product, before trying Bump Patrol, make sure you are not contributing to your ingrown hair and razor burn problem with poor grooming habits:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always use a sharp razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always use a clean razor. Dip the blade in, or spritz the blade with 91% isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol to assist with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prepare your skin and hair prior to shaving: The hair and skin needs to be wet and even soaked for at least 2 minutes before shaving.  This softens the hair and makes it easier to cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use plenty of lubricant (shaving oil, gel, cream, etc.) and allow whatever medium you use to soak on your head for a few minutes before shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving in the shower is a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use hot water to prepare your skin. Use cold water to rinse when you are done shaving.  Heat opens pores, cold closes them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make as few passes with your razor as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For really stubborn areas, as far as bumps go, try to compromise with a less close shave by shaving with the grain as opposed to against the grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Multiple blade razors work by gripping the hair, pulling it out of the skin and slicing it such that when the hair retracts, it is beneath the surface of the skin.  This will give you a very close shave, but it will likely increase your chances of ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, if you have done all the aforementioned things and still have problems with ingrown hairs and razor burn, try simpler products first, such as witch hazel, a natural astringent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did all of these things, and still had bumps for years.  Bump Patrol Maximum Strength eliminated them.  There is no better testament to the effectiveness of any product than that.</li>
    <li> At least for me, it didn&#x27;t work as well as the regular version. I went back to using the regular one after about 2 weeks of use.</li>
    <li> The regular bump patrol works much better. This does an okay job, but it does not give the &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; like regular bump-patrol to reassure you no bumps will form.</li>
    <li> This is pretty good stuff. Works well at keeping bumps to a minimum.</li>
    <li> Product was quickly received, and identical to what I purchased at a local pharmacy.  The pric, however, was lower than what was posted on the manufacturer&#x27;s website.</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction to the High Times products. This product really works. I also use it on my shaved head and ahhh, nice and soothing.</li>
    <li> Husband swears by this. Says it really helps to reduce those ingrown hairs</li>
    <li> I first bought this product at a pharmacy. There is the Shave Gel and the After Shave&lt;br /&gt;Bump treatment. Both the Gel and Bump After Shave Treatment are excellent. I am someone who cuts himself every time I shave and razor burn is common. These products are THE BEST I have ever used. The Bump Patrol aftershave comes in different strengths--Intense, Extra Strength, Original Formula, and Maximum Strength. The only one I could locate in stores was Original, so I ordered the Max Strength thru Amazon. If you are someone like me who is tired of cuts and burns after every shave, then I truly recommend you try this.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, I figured this product would work great (I am a woman). However I dont really see much of a change, bumps and blemishes worked better</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and it works like a charm.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this after shaving.  He is African American and prone to bumps and ingrown hairs on his neck.  This product really works.  He is totally happy with it and is a loyal customer.  He uses it everyday and has NO bumps.  You must use a good razor as well.  He uses Mach 3. If you have a problem with bumps you HAVE to get the good razors and replace when they get dull.  If you do that and use this product... you will see results.</li>
    <li> I started going bald at a very young age and decide to go the completely shaven route. However i constantly used to get nasty shaving bumps and ingrown hairs on the back of my neck &amp; head. needless to say it was very uncomfortable for me and it looked nasty. so after trying just about everything i could think of i found bump patrol, i have used almost all of their after shaves and they all work extremely well. would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great Stuff, keeps my ingrown hairs in check.</li>
    <li> Product achieves workable  result.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, he really likes it!!</li>
    <li> So far so good.  It appears to be working on the facial areas as expected..</li>
    <li> If I could give it a 0 star I would! Makes any bumps really red and is really liquid</li>
    <li> I love it.  Works really fast in getting rid of unsightly razor bumps.  Now my head is smooth as a baby&#x27;s ......Well.... You know what I mean....</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t really an effective product in preventing razor bumps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different things to get rid of my unsightly razor bumps. I have found that shaving daily (before the hair can curl back into the skin) combined with applying this immediately after shaving works best. Now my neck finally looks normal and isn&#x27;t sensitive to the touch.</li>
    <li> I got duped!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I should have realized from the color of the packaging that it was not the normal treatment but I am glad I got duped as this extra strength formulation seems even more effective in preventing and minimizing bumps or inflammation post shave than the regular formula was (which already was better than anything else I&#x27;d ever used).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This formulation looks more like a golden color and has a different aroma to it than the regular formula which is on the blue green side and smells differently but aside from the color and smell this formula seems to really seriously kill the bacteria that is the culprit to all manner of  bump formation be it from razor bumps or just razor irritation due to having a blade scrape your epidermis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten after nearly 20 years of shaving to a system where I rarely ever get any bumps and it is due to protactive and consistent application of bump control after I get out the shower and then covering with moisturizer to serve as barrier to bacterial invasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now when I shave my head the skin is squeeky clean smooth with zero irritation, even the crease at the back of my head is clear of any bumps due to the sudden angle changes in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been applying the maximum strength formulation exclusively to my head and face since receiving the package last week...even though I have the regular strength supply still ready...the difference in improvement was actually noticeable between the two products...I guess owing to a lot more of the active ingredient being in this product and thus really killing off  the bacteria in my case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Muy Bueno!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I got this by accident...it will be the default purchase from now on!</li>
    <li> Highly recommended.  Have tried other products and all the Bump Patrol formulations, this is by far the best.</li>
    <li> Great product i recommend it to anyone&lt;br /&gt;who is having razor bump issues it works.</li>
    <li> So let&#x27;s start with I have repurchased this item. It does seem to help with redness and bumps. Is it perfect ...no. Is it better than most products ...absolutely. However, it stinks. It smells like I covered my face in vinegar. Clearly not a small you want to have if you were say going on a date or to a meeting. Even after putting something on to mask it after the small still seeps through.</li>
    <li> Cheapest price for this great product. The only thing that keeps my neck from breaking out terribly after shaving.</li>
    <li> This did not work at all for me. I usually have a breakout when I shave and I tried applying Bump Patrol soon after shaving but still the breakout happens and I still get the nasty razor bumps. This might not be good for tough skin maybe. It was uncomfortable and itchy at application and smelled bad. I am black male and although it might have worked for some of my friends for me its not working.</li>
    <li> I am a woman, I use this on my bikini line. It works okay but I actually found that the regular strength worked better. This one is better because it is clear and smells okay where as the regular strength one is blue and stinky... still it worked better (I thought).</li>
    <li> If your face bumps up, this is a great product! I have it very bad! Without Bump Patrol, I would have a bump for every hair! This has been the only product that can tame my shaving problems. I have used all three strengths and this one works for me. If I use it twice a day, on clean skin, I have great results. I have given it to people, some in the military, to get their reaction and they love it too. Take it from a guy who for many years has had to deal with shaving issues, USE THIS AND YOU WILL BE HAPPY WITH YOUR FACE!!!</li>
    <li> I brought this product for my sons and they loved it.  This max bump patrol really does the job and the clean smooth faces in my house are smiling again.  I mean that there is no more complaints about ,&#x27;Oh man look at that razor bump..&#x27;.  This product really does the &#x27;trick&#x27; for men of colour.  The shipment was on time Would highly recommend</li>
    <li> This product is magical. it is as effective as the supplier made it to be. I&#x27;m loving it.,</li>
    <li> This product is great. It has little to no scent and rubs on easily. It got rid of all of my razor burn after just a few applications. I love it because it ended up replacing a lot of the other products that I normally would use.</li>
    <li> God&#x27;s gift to African American Men - my skin is ridiculously sensitive and this product clears up my skin within 3 days.</li>
    <li> This stuff definitely helps to reduce the appearance of razor bumps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with razor burn and bumps on and off for several years so was looking for a product to help me out.  I came across Bump Patrol and decided to give it a shot based on the reviews.  I was very skeptical when I made this purchase as I really didn&#x27;t think any kind of product would truly help.  To my complete amazement, this stuff worked! It honestly worked the very first time I used it.  Not only did it help but it completely eliminated all of my razor bumps and burns.  When I first applied it, it stung a bit itself so I really had my doubts about it working at that point thinking it would actually do more harm than good. But like I said, it worked extremely well and I&#x27;ve been using every since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to mention that this is a clear liquid - more like an aftershave and not a lotion which I thought it was when I bought it.  This makes it a little trickier to apply, but still easy to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying another bottle when mine runs out.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is best aftershave I have ever used. I never had to worry about razor bumps with this on the cheeks and neck. The only reason its not a five star product is because the smell. This needs a nice cologne scent</li>
    <li> I suffer from razor bumps bad like painful to the touch bad. I used the regular strength and it worked well. I tried this and my painful bumps were gonna in hours. I now use this after every shave.</li>
    <li> It prevents bumps both on my face and the back of my head, which the regular strength bump patrol didn&#x27;t do.</li>
    <li> Works like magic in my opinion. It&#x27;s helped me out so much</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin as well as very coarse hair..double whammy. This product takes care of the ingrown hair problem that causes razor bumps and cleared mine right up as well as moisturizes and smells good.</li>
    <li> I have used the regular strength for a while with a mixed success and decided to try the maximum strength. It didn&#x27;t notice any improvement at all. It&#x27;s also very oily.</li>
    <li> tl;dr. It doesn&#x27;t matter the color of your skin. If you get razor bumps, you need this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the suave lookin&#x27; brotha on the box get you confused, this is the *best* razor bump/ingrown hair treatment available without a physician&#x27;s prescription for anyone of any color, race, or ethnicity that gets bumps and ingrown hairs. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re shaving your face, you head, your arms/legs, or more...intimate areas, this will prevent bumps and with repeated use, take care of the ones that you already have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BP Max comes in a plastic squeeze bottle. Tweeze, lather up, shave, pat dry, and then apply this magic. Don&#x27;t use a rag or a cotton ball; apply directly to your palms and then to wherever you just shaved. This is a thin liquid, so like an old commercial said &amp;#34;just a dab will do ya&amp;#34;.  It will leave a not so great smelling, slightly sticky/oily feeling on your face, and (depending on how you shaved) a little sting. Just let it sit and do its work. As soon as it has dried you can go about your day, or apply your favorite moisturizer (if you&#x27;re not using it, you should start, your skin will thank you later!) or fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should notice far fewer bumps and ingrown hairs as your hair grows back in. Some times, especially for those of your with kinkier hair, you may still get an ingrown from time to time. I shave every other day, and this stuff lasts a good long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, don&#x27;t balk at the price. You need this, and your skin is worth it.</li>
    <li> My husband gets alot of ingrown hairs and has been dealing with it all his life, as many black men do. This product seems to work real well for him. We have tried many different products over the years and this seems to be a good one.</li>
    <li> Yes for me this is a good product, greatly reduces the rash, ive been using it for 3 years now</li>
    <li> I USE THIS PRODUCT ALL THE TIME,BUT IT IS NOT ALWAYS IN STOCK IN MY AREA.IT REALLY,REALLY WORKS GREAT.I WILL BE ORDERING MORE.</li>
    <li> Used for past 5 years band my skin is as smooth as a babies boittom!!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE this stuff,,, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be aware that Afro American men MUST use PROPER procedures when shaving daily: Such as Following these shaving instructions can help prevent razor bumps from forming:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a hot shower before shaving, to soften the hair and open the pores.&lt;br /&gt;Use a thick shaving gel.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t stretch the skin when shaving, and always shave in the direction your beard grows. Use the fewest razor strokes possible. Rinse with cold water.&lt;br /&gt;After shaving, press a cold wet cloth against your face for 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, smooth Bump Patrol on EVERY part of your face where a razor was cutting your hair!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If not done Consistently,  African American ARE susceptible to a African American skin disease called: Pseudofolliculitis Barbae, small, irritated bumps on the skin. They develop after shaving, when strands of hair curl back on themselves and grow into the skin &amp; cause irritation. Razor bumps are common among African Americans and people with tightly coiled hair.</li>
    <li> As a long-time sufferer of in-grown hairs, I had originally tried out the &amp;#34;Regular Strength&amp;#34; brand, and found that it was mostly, but not completely, effective, but before restocking I noticed that Amazon postings about the &amp;#34;Maximum Strength&amp;#34; variety, so I bought one of each (figuring at worst the Max would be too strong or react poorly on my skin and I could just go back to the Regular)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, the bottle of Regular is getting used on areas less prone to in-growns, and I will be using the Max Strength from now on exclusively. Like other posters have mentioned, proper grooming techniques are still critically important, but the addition of this product has completely resolved any issues related to razor bumps on the areas I shave. Regardless of ethnicity or style/grade of hair, if you get razor bumps or irritations from shaving, you need to try this, regardless of the cost.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what to say other than this stuff really works. It&#x27;s funny because I bought it for my head but then didn&#x27;t need it for that. I ended up using on my face. I don&#x27;t shave my beard, I only trim it but I do keep it at stubble length. I was getting certain spots on my face that when I would run the trimmer over it, I would see stars. So I figured what the heck I already bought this stuff, let&#x27;s give it a whirl. After using it a few times, no more stars. My only issue is that to me it smells like mustard on your face, but it goes away after like a minute or less, so I don&#x27;t care. So now I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
    <li> I incurred a lot of razor bumps within the first month that I started shaving with an electric razor.  This was due to the direction that I was shaving-in (note: I am an African American with very curly hair).  Once I started using this product, I observed a noticeable difference within a day.  Now, I can shave in any direction and still forgo the inconvenience of unsightly razor bumps/ingrown hairs.  Awesome product... I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> To completely prevent razor bumps you have to continue to use the product up to 3 days after shaving. But once you do that there will be no razor bumps. It does dry out your skin so be sure to apply some lotion about 30min afterwards</li>
    <li> I used this product for two weeks now. I shave my head with a razor, my face and neck with clippers.&lt;br /&gt;It really clear up my ingrown hair problem on the back of my head, especially right at the hook of my bald head (making to many passes with the razor). Up under my nick, it dried them out where you able flex them out smoothly. Maximum clear that up after two application,I put it on then a few hours later wash my head, neck apply Bump patrol  maximum again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It Even Clear Up Some Dark Blemishes from picking &amp; squeezing  with tweezers.  Having a bald head some, new baseball caps or skull caps even have broken me out. Bump patrol  maximum cleared my break outs by morning, red swelling bumps or ingrown hair bumps, whitehead bumps or whitehead ingrown hair bumps. Maximum clear that up.</li>
    <li> i have always liked bumb pator</li>
    <li> I use to buy product in the 80&#x27;s - 90&#x27;s and it worked great!!&lt;br /&gt;I find this recent purchase of the Bump Patrol product watered down and as productive&lt;br /&gt;I have to use it more frequently.</li>
    <li> This product was definitely two steps up from the regular Bump Patrol aftershave lotion. I particularly like that fact that it does not have the alcoholic feel and smell to it; it is actually an effective lotion.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good product, its definitely been enhanced compared to the original one. Definitely a good product for preventing bumps.</li>
    <li> Great product. Would definitely recommend. I noticed the difference on the very first application. Thank you Bump Patrol.</li>
    <li> Ever since I was 16 and started to grow facial hair, little white bumps would ALWAYS appear after I shaved. I knew something was up, and my dermatologist gave me a cream that didn&#x27;t work. I don&#x27;t even know how I stumbled upon this, but it works fabulously. I am white, but I have very coarse facial hair that grows in multiple directions and, as a result, makes me prone to razor bumps. The extra strength has a better texture than the regular and smells more pleasant AND dries quicker. I wish they made a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> For some reason this version isn&#x27;t as strong as their normal version. And I know that because the regular version basically burns my face off but I get no ingrown hairs. With this, it doesn&#x27;t hurt, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to prevent ingrown hairs/razor burn either. Somewhat confusing that maximum strength does nothing and normal strength seems to be super-maximal.</li>
    <li> works really well for razor bumps.</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase this product after hearing and reading so many positive comments concerning the effectiveness of its results. I can honestly say that for me the results after using this product were positive.</li>
    <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried many after shave gels or lotions to help with razor bumps and none came close to this product. I saw instant results. If you haven&#x27;t tried this product, I suggest you start right away. It will make you get throw away whatever you&#x27;re using. And there is no after smell after all. Love It.</li>
