      <li>It&#x27;s clear that the polish was new because the polish was still liquidy and hadn&#x27;t hardened at all around the brush.</li>
      <li>It is a true red - tomato/cherry red.</li>
      <li>If you want any brand of nail polish to last make sure your nails are clean and wipe them down with a small amount of alcohol before you apply the polish.</li>
      <li>True blue color will last about 7 days with two coats no clear needed have 43 of this product in different colors</li>

    <li> Very nice color. Fast and great packaging.</li>
    <li> love the color cherry red matches exactly with my red lipstick!!</li>
    <li> I live this nail polish. In the past, I would chip my polish within a day. This polish is amazing. I can go a full day without a nick AND this dries super fast! Really, I&#x27;m impressed. I can wear this all week with just a couple touch ups. Very low maintenance and it doesn&#x27;t ruin your nails like shellac or gel nail polishes. It also comes off super easy with regular nail polish remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package was delivered with little lots of bubble wrap to protect and when I expected. Overall, great buy.</li>
    <li> I use this for fly tying.  It puts a shiny durable head on my flies.  Stands up to water, rocks and teeth and still looks good. Keeps the tying thread from coming undone. Works great.</li>
