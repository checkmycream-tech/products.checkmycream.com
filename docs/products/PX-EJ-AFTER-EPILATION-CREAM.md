      <li>I just love it because it works well!</li>
      <li>the smell is nice,  </li>
      <li>I am very happy I got this product and highly recommend it to anyone who uses an epilator.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described, works great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this after every treatment and the hair is no lighter, thinner or more stunted in growth.</li>
      <li>Love it, will be buying more to keep using.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still trying and learning how to make it feel better.</li>
      <li>I can deal with the pain because I love not having to shave as often.  </li>
      <li>It helps sooth the irritation from using the epilator and makes my legs look even better.</li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t have to use a lot on your legs to make them more comforatable and it lasts longer.</li>
      <li>If you are suffering from redness and bumps, do try this, you will love the results.</li>
      <li>I just love the moisture.</li>
      <li>this one I wasn&#x27;t too sure about when I got it</li>
      <li>I was not so sure about this product when I purchased it but now having used it for 3 months.</li>
      <li>but I noticed that it works more as a calming cream for after immediate epilation.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that the best way to deal with ingrown hairs is to 1) exfoliate well, and 2)moisturize with a plain, unscented lotion (St. Ives or tons of drugstore brands have inexpensive good ones), and 3) use tea tree oil  </li>
      <li>It was pretty good, but Emjoi works much better.</li>
      <li>First of all,I decided to buy this product thanks to the excellent reviews.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think it was anything special, and it seems kind of overpriced to me.</li>
      <li>now they grow slower than molasis and come out much more easily.  </li>
      <li>the best part it hurts less :).</li>
      <li>Sweet!</li>
      <li>Not greasy, easy to use.  </li>
      <li>The cream is easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I bought this because my body hair grows very quick</li>
      <li>it seems to be pretty cost effective for my purposes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for legs, underarms, upper lip and bikini.  </li>
      <li>Since I started epilating ingrowns had become a problem and my leg was not as smooth as it used to be when I used to wax.</li>
      <li>This is a great product, not only does it moisturize epilated areas well</li>
      <li>This lotion however, is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>I like the smell, my legs felt awesome using just this lotion everyday.  </li>
      <li>still testing but so far so good</li>
      <li>Works nice, smells nice, wish it came in a bigger bottle.</li>
      <li>The cream does what it states and is well worth the price!  </li>
      <li>Anyways, about the product, I didn&#x27;t find that it was anything special.</li>
      <li>I use it right afterwards, and the irritation and bumps have gone almost 100% away!  </li>
      <li>However, I shall need more experience with it to tell whether it really inhibits regrowth.  </li>
      <li>It is good enough</li>
      <li>Hair came out very fast and easy.     </li>
      <li>It really does decrease the ingrown hairs and red bumps, plus leaves your skin so very nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t how many ounces the bottle holds, but I wish it held more for the same price.</li>
      <li>I believe the hairs become softer and remove easier w/ regular epilation itself, not so sure about the magic of hair growth slowing.</li>
      <li>It does not smooth on as easily as I would like, but does make my skin feel good.</li>
      <li>I use this cream every time I epilate and it leaves my skin very silky and smooth.</li>
      <li>so im not crazy abt it...</li>
      <li>but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>It is worth the try...</li>
      <li>It is pricy, but totally worth it, IMHO.  </li>
      <li>it never irritates my skin and it&#x27;s invisible once it&#x27;s applied and then seems to be completely absorbed into the skin after a half-hour or so.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this seller for this product and many others, they certainly know how to treat the customer</li>
      <li>right.  </li>
      <li>I used a couple of different liquid products to reduce bumps, but they were very drying and not all that effective.  </li>
      <li>you don&#x27;t have to use very much (I&#x27;ve been using for three months and am just over halfway through the bottle), and it absorbs well into the skin without making you feel greasy the rest of the day.</li>
      <li>as I&#x27;m most likely not going to go without just to get a comparison.</li>
      <li>I used it after using my epilator and my legs are so soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>and I used it exactly as directed.</li>
      <li>After applying this cream as the instructions suggested for more than four weeks, I didn&#x27;t notice any change; in fact, the only thing I noticed was that I started having an ingrown hair problem.</li>
      <li>Sorry, couldn&#x27;t give a better explanation. ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !</li>
      <li>I give this high marks!!</li>
      <li>it goes down much more quickly.</li>
      <li>One of the reviewers billed this as the solution to the problem of ingrown hairs, one of the main disadvantages of epilating (besides the pain, of course!).</li>
      <li>I bought the After Epilation Cream when I bought the Emjoi epilator, and it really does what it says.  </li>
      <li>It moisturizes the skin very well.</li>
      <li>I do like this product but don&#x27;t really see the hair growth process being effected by it.  </li>
      <li>The cream was soothing after the epilation process, but I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in the appearance of my hair.  </li>
      <li>I recieved it in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t really comment on it.</li>
      <li>This after-epilation cream is very soothing.  </li>
      <li>It really soothes your skin after epilation.  </li>
      <li>it really dose work, I had problems with ingrown hairs since I started using an epilater.</li>
      <li>It really helps relieve the pain that comes with using an epilator</li>
      <li>Probably won&#x27;t ever really find out,</li>
      <li>I will be buying more in the near future!</li>
      <li>I used it after my first use of my new Epilady hair remover and my rash is gone overnight.</li>
      <li>I gave four stars because your legs don&#x27;t stay stubble free for as long as they say it will</li>
      <li>My only reason for not giving a full 5 stars is that I do not like the consistency of the lotion.  </li>
      <li>I bought this cream to use in conjunction with epilating, and certainly by now, the end of 2012, it would seem that I shouldn&#x27;t have hair growing back at all, right?</li>
      <li>and I seriously never get ingrown hairs when I do that.</li>
      <li>Although the cream has a pleasant feel, I&#x27;m not sure that it actually reduces hair growth.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it for after epilation.</li>
      <li>With my epilator, my hair is hardley growing back and my ingrown hairs surfaced after the first use!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!! it really dose work, I had problems with ingrown hairs since I started using an epilater. This cream solved the problem and I can&#x27;t imagine using an epilater without it.</li>
    <li> I began using an epilator about a year ago.  I can deal with the pain because I love not having to shave as often.  However, the bumps on my skin for days afterwards were not acceptable, and I was about to give up.  I used a couple of different liquid products to reduce bumps, but they were very drying and not all that effective.  This lotion however, is fantastic.  I use it right afterwards, and the irritation and bumps have gone almost 100% away!  Cannot imagine using an epilator without this stuff now.  It is pricy, but totally worth it, IMHO.  If you are suffering from redness and bumps, do try this, you will love the results.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a short time ago, so I have not had the time with it as other have, however I have used it after epilation and it works well on the skin, and lasts a long time - most of the day unless you are wearing tight fitting clothes. I have also noticed that it helps to reduce the ingrown hairs as well.    I&#x27;ll have to see if it actually works as it says, but the nice part is that so little goes so far, you only need to put on a very very small amount for a large area.    As a side note, the seller I bought from, [...], was exceptional to deal with! I had a small issue, and they made things 300 percent right with me!  I would highly recommend this seller for this product and many others, they certainly know how to treat the customer right.  They have earned a client for life.</li>
    <li> This product is really good. Results in 10 days max... Since I started epilating ingrowns had become a problem and my leg was not as smooth as it used to be when I used to wax. I tried the expensive creams and lotions for ingrowns with no results but this product really works. Ingrowns are so much controlled, hair growth is slow and legs feel smoother.. the best part it hurts less :). It is worth the try... I loved it...</li>
    <li> I recieved it in a reasonable amount of time. I am not sure if the product is actually working yet or not because I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough, but it smells great and leaves my skin feeling really soft and smooth. A little does go a very long ways, so the bottle will last a very long time.</li>
    <li> I am overseas, and the order and shipping was easy and flawless. It&#x27;s supposed to hinder hair re-growth after epilation. I guess it&#x27;s working cuz it&#x27;s been 2 weeks still no hair! Sweet!</li>
    <li> One of the reviewers billed this as the solution to the problem of ingrown hairs, one of the main disadvantages of epilating (besides the pain, of course!). I found it helped for ingrowns, but didn&#x27;t solve the problem completely. I had fewer itchy red bumps a week or two down the line, but there were still a few. Where it does help a lot is with the redness after epilating - it goes down much more quickly.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product for its purpose.  This cream does help skin stay smoother, with less ingrown hairs after epilation.  It also smells very nice and soothing.  My only reason for not giving a full 5 stars is that I do not like the consistency of the lotion.  It is very thick and doesn&#x27;t rub completely into your skin, instead it just leaves behind a white pasty mess.</li>
    <li> This after-epilation cream is very soothing.  However, I shall need more experience with it to tell whether it really inhibits regrowth.  It seems to, but I&#x27;m a little unsure whether the hair wouldn&#x27;t grow back at the same rate without it.  Probably won&#x27;t ever really find out, as I&#x27;m most likely not going to go without just to get a comparison.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very scary, the sound of grinding only to be followed by pain upon each and every touch to your skin. It seems to be effective but difficult to justify with so much discomfort. I&#x27;m still trying and learning how to make it feel better.</li>
    <li> Nice thick cream.  I used it after using my epilator and my legs are so soft and smooth.  I love that it doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell.  I actually couldn&#x27;t really detect a smell at all.</li>
    <li> The cream is easy to apply. It gives a silky and not greasy feeling. The key here (and as with any other products) is to use it according to instructions. I saw less in-grown hair, but since one needs to use it very often, the small bottle won&#x27;t last that long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never shave again.  This is a great product.  I recommend this to everyone who dreads shaving every other day to get rid of unwanted hair.  It&#x27;s great for legs, underarms, upper lip and bikini.  Its a great investment.</li>
    <li> cream good epilation bad!</li>
    <li> I gave four stars because your legs don&#x27;t stay stubble free for as long as they say it will but it does work wonderfully!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion on my face for about 4 months even though the label says it&#x27;s not for facial use. it never irritates my skin and it&#x27;s invisible once it&#x27;s applied and then seems to be completely absorbed into the skin after a half-hour or so. i use it twice a day sometimes.  i decided on to try permanent hair removal because i don&#x27;t want a beard and i don&#x27;t want to shave either.  i&#x27;ve only epilated part of my face and in those areas where i have, the hair is just barely growing now. at first the hairs were so tough it was like pulling teeth. now they grow slower than molasis and come out much more easily.  of course it&#x27;s well known that the epilation itself does damage to the follicle and slows down the regrown hair, even without the lotion. i don&#x27;t have enough epilating experience to say how much effect the lotion has in itself. but the bottle was less than $20 and i&#x27;ve only used about $5 worth in 4 months, so it seems to be pretty cost effective for my purposes.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, not only does it moisturize epilated areas well, it&#x27;s easy to use, and a little really goes a long way.  It has ended my search for the perfect solution to ingrown hairs- I have a nasty problem with those... And it&#x27;s replaced my supply of Tend Skin and PFB Vanish! With Tend Skin and PFB my skin became extremely dry and flaked horribly, even liberally exfoliating and moisturizing the areas couldn&#x27;t get rid of the peeling.  Emjoi&#x27;s After Epilation Cream does a great job of freeing trapped hairs under the skin, softening the skin, and making the hairs easier to remove, and much less painful.  I bought the set with 2 bottles, but after opening one I can tell that it will last me a long time even though they are only 4 oz. each.  I was reluctant to give five stars, but bearing any unforseeable reaction to the cream, I think it deserves it... Buy it!</li>
    <li> Working well for soothing after epilating, if you are going to epilate you absolutely should have a soothing cream I found that out the hard way this one works well for that&lt;br /&gt; I will have to wait and see if it helps to slow down or prevent the growth of hair I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week</li>
    <li> The cream does what it states and is well worth the price!  I will be buying more in the near future!</li>
    <li> First of all,I decided to buy this product thanks to the excellent reviews. I bought this because my body hair grows very quick so I thought that this product would help me to slow the process; however it didn&#x27;t do it at all. After applying this cream as the instructions suggested for more than four weeks, I didn&#x27;t notice any change; in fact, the only thing I noticed was that I started having an ingrown hair problem. Additionally, I disliked the smell of this cream because it was as if I were using a type of hair salon product. Another bad thing was that when I received this product by mail some of it was poured in the box because the container wasn&#x27;t complete sealed.</li>
    <li> Now THIS is some miracle stuff. WHY didn&#x27;t I discover this 10 years ago when I initially started epilating?! It really does decrease the ingrown hairs and red bumps, plus leaves your skin so very nice and smooth. Don&#x27;t Epilate Without It!!!</li>
    <li> still testing but so far so good</li>
    <li> Smells so horrible, I can&#x27;t even use it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to use after doing home waxing.  I use Brazilian bikini body hard wax on my bikini area.  I was hoping that this would really help my thick, coarse, pubic hair to thin out.  I&#x27;ve been using it for three months now.  I think it has helped incrimentaly with reducing the rate of growth but not a whole lot.  I do plan to continue buying the product however, because I have MUCH less of a problem with ingrown hairs since I&#x27;ve been using it.  I used to be covered in red, itchy spots when my hair started to grow back, now I only get a few spots, which I can immediately relive with the use of tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;Other pluses of this product:  the smell is nice,  you don&#x27;t have to use very much (I&#x27;ve been using for three months and am just over halfway through the bottle), and it absorbs well into the skin without making you feel greasy the rest of the day.</li>
    <li> Works. I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of the scent though.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, works great. Really does slow hair regrowth. If you are looking for a product simply to do this then give them a try it is far easier than going for hot waxes so much.</li>
    <li> This was not in my Epilady kit nor did it come as a bonus as stated</li>
    <li> Reduced number of ingrown hair drastically</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the epilator so didn&#x27;t use the cream</li>
    <li> I just love it because it works well!</li>
    <li> I like the smell, my legs felt awesome using just this lotion everyday.  Just one week of use before I used the Epilator again.  Hair came out very fast and easy.     Love it, will be buying more to keep using.</li>
    <li> You have to use a lot to get the job done. It does leave the skin feeling smooth and the smell isn&#x27;t too terrible.</li>
    <li> Using this cream doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference after using my epilator. You should probably redesign the bottle to have a pump top, because it&#x27;s a pain to stick your finger in the bottle to get any out since it&#x27;s so thick you can&#x27;t hardly beat the cream out into your hand and when you do you get way too much.</li>
    <li> i dont use the stuff religously so i cant complain but i didnt really find it made such a difference and i didnt like the feel of it or the smell so im not crazy abt it...</li>
    <li> This product arrived exploded in the box...I&#x27;m not sure why, as the cap was screwed on tight and the flip top was securely closed, so I don&#x27;t really know how it could have gotten out besides the person packing saw that it was leaking, closed it up, and send it off with cream everywhere...?  Anyways, about the product, I didn&#x27;t find that it was anything special. It didn&#x27;t help with ingrown hairs or moisturize any better than using a plain unscented lotion from the drugstore. It definitely didn&#x27;t help slow hair grown, in my opinion. I don&#x27;t know, maybe my hair grows freakishly fast or something, but I&#x27;ve found I get maybe 2 weeks, certainly not 4 before having to deal with regrowth. I didn&#x27;t think it was anything special, and it seems kind of overpriced to me. I&#x27;ve found that the best way to deal with ingrown hairs is to 1) exfoliate well, and 2)moisturize with a plain, unscented lotion (St. Ives or tons of drugstore brands have inexpensive good ones), and 3) use tea tree oil  I apply it with a cotton ball and I seriously never get ingrown hairs when I do that.</li>
    <li> With my epilator, my hair is hardley growing back and my ingrown hairs surfaced after the first use! I have extremely sensitive skin so I am so tickeled that i can use this and have beautiful looking skin! My partner also enjoys it on me!</li>
    <li> For the past 16 years, I&#x27;ve only used an epilation machine for my legs.  In the beginning it was an Epilady, but for the past 3 years or so, I&#x27;ve used the Emjoi epilation machine (which I really love, by the way.)  I bought the After Epilation Cream when I bought the Emjoi epilator, and it really does what it says.  The skin is smoother, hair grows back slowly, and my major concern -- no in-grown hairs.  In-grown hairs were always a problem when I used drug store body lotions.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products over the years, and I used Shepards Lotion for the longest time.  It was pretty good, but Emjoi works much better. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only reason I might not give the product 5 stars is that it seems expensive to me.  I don&#x27;t how many ounces the bottle holds, but I wish it held more for the same price.</li>
    <li> Bought, but don&#x27;t use. Sorry, couldn&#x27;t give a better explanation. ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !</li>
    <li> I bought this along with a Epi Slim.  I am waiting to use this until I get someone to come over and help me use this on my legs and use the Epi Slim on my legs.  Am, disabled and not able to do myself.</li>
    <li> Not only did this not mention it wasn&#x27;t for faces, but it doesn&#x27;t even work anyway. waste of money. A lot of money, too.</li>
    <li> See no real use for this cream, and the cost is excessive.</li>
    <li> I used it after my first use of my new Epilady hair remover and my rash is gone overnight.</li>
    <li> It helps sooth the irritation from using the epilator and makes my legs look even better. It moisturizes the skin very well. It claims to slow down the regrowth of hair but I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to know about that yet. I just love the moisture. It really helps it relieves dry itchy skin where other moisturizers have failed. This stuff says to apply a small amount to the skin and a little really does go a long way so you only need a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the smell of it or that I have to use it every day for 10 days before I can start using it only 2 or 3 times a week but I think it&#x27;s worth it. You can find this product cheaper and unopened at walmart.com this one I wasn&#x27;t too sure about when I got it but it appeared to have been previously opened.</li>
    <li> Although the cream has a pleasant feel, I&#x27;m not sure that it actually reduces hair growth. The product is rather pricey</li>
    <li> I was not so sure about this product when I purchased it but now having used it for 3 months. I love it! It really helps relieve the pain that comes with using an epilator and it really does make your hair grow slower and come back less course. It&#x27;s thicker than normal lotion so you don&#x27;t have to use a lot on your legs to make them more comforatable and it lasts longer. I am very happy I got this product and highly recommend it to anyone who uses an epilator.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product!!!! this may have your next option if you have the epilator already...it feels great in your skin...</li>
    <li> This cream is good, but not wonderful, and is a bit expensive.  It does not smooth on as easily as I would like, but does make my skin feel good.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with my Epilater.  I returned my eplilator, however still have the lotion.  I use it after I shave, so I don&#x27;t know if the lotion has the same affect.  It is good enough I guess.  Don&#x27;t know if I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> i guess it does slow down the regrowth of the hair. it&#x27;s nice, smells very nice too. i like the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this after every treatment and the hair is no lighter, thinner or more stunted in growth. This dream doesn&#x27;t even help irritation...</li>
    <li> This seems the help with my ingrown hairs. Doesn&#x27;t prevent every one but helps after epilation and shaving. I&#x27;ll continue to use it. A little pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> This product clams that it slows the process of reaccuring hair growth but I noticed that it works more as a calming cream for after immediate epilation.  I do like this product but don&#x27;t really see the hair growth process being effected by it.  The epilation itself is what is making the hair grow in less.</li>
    <li> Good for the skin after epilation. Softens the skin and reduces the chance of getting ingrown hairs.  Would recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> It is my go to product.  Works well.  Not greasy, easy to use.  I would highly recommend it for after epilation.</li>
    <li> Which surprised me.  When I was using it consistently, I did notice that the hair re-growth was less, however the results don&#x27;t last when you&#x27;re not using it.  Considering it&#x27;s kind of expensive, it&#x27;s a little much to ask to be using it everyday for the rest of your hairy life.</li>
    <li> Gave me two abscesses.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product.  It really soothes your skin after epilation.  I recommend this especially for people new to using an epilator.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream to use in conjunction with epilating, and certainly by now, the end of 2012, it would seem that I shouldn&#x27;t have hair growing back at all, right? That&#x27;s not the case in my situation. It doesn&#x27;t seem to have had any effect at all and I used it exactly as directed. Also, I&#x27;m not a fan of the fragrance. Why must fragrance be added to EVERYTHING these days?</li>
    <li> Thinner and finer hair with a few months use.love it!</li>
    <li> Bought item for my gf for her new epilator. Works nice, smells nice, wish it came in a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> I have only ever epilated and used this cream but this is an excellent moisturizer. I have been amazed that after waxing, I could have stubble again at 2 weeks. With this cream and my epilated I might have a few persistent hairs but at 3 weeks my legs are amazingly soft and stubble-free. And I appreciate that a little bit goes a long way. Not sticky or greasy either. I give this high marks!!</li>
    <li> I use this cream every time I epilate and it leaves my skin very silky and smooth. A little goes a long way. Will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I wax and epilate my legs, and used to get a lot of ingrown hairs. With the use of this product, I barely get any compared to before. I can notice a HUUUUUGE difference between when I didn&#x27;t use this cream and now. I didn&#x27;t  buy it for the &#x27;hair growth inhibition&#x27; so I can&#x27;t really comment on it. A MUST if you have a problem with ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> I used the entire tube after groin epilation sessions until it was gone, I believe it helped ameliorate some ingrown hairs and it was a quality soothing lotion, but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m convinced it slowed regrowth.  Been epilating all regions for 10 months now, haven&#x27;t used this or any other &amp;#34;epilation cream&amp;#34; since this ran out, and don&#x27;t feel drawn to invest in it again.  I believe the hairs become softer and remove easier w/ regular epilation itself, not so sure about the magic of hair growth slowing.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use it because it burned a little after using my epilator.</li>
    <li> The cream was soothing after the epilation process, but I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in the appearance of my hair.  It also had a strange aroma to it.</li>
