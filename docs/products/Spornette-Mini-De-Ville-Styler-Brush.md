      <li>The absolute perfect size for traveling.</li>
      <li>Good quality hairbrush and perfect to take along for touch up when it is not convenient to take a larger brush.</li>
      <li>Her hair is very fine too so</li>
      <li>This is a great size to keep in a purse but works almost as well on my hair as my large brush.</li>
      <li>I should have read the information better.</li>
      <li>It feels fine but make sure it is the correct size that you need.</li>
      <li>I would love to see this Deville Rectangle in a medium size, the mini is fine for purse use</li>
      <li>I have a 20 year old boars hair brush that is still great.</li>
      <li>Love this type of brush,boar bristle is the best type of brush I have bought them in the past, would recommend to any one.</li>
      <li>I purchased the Spornette Mini Deville boar bristle brush for my husband who has fine hair.</li>
      <li>so I am good for the next 30 years.</li>
      <li>Brush is good quality but  the boar bristles wreak of a boar smell (much like javalena) -- soaking in ammonia and soap solution for an hour or so nearly eliminated the stink.</li>
      <li>It will do a good job with my long hair-</li>
      <li>This is a great little brush.</li>
      <li>Soft boar bristles, good wooden handle.</li>
      <li>I decided I needed a smaller brush and one better for travel.&lt;br</li>
      <li>exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I love the natural wood handle because it creates less static than plastic.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy with any of the baby hair brushes on the market, they were flimsy and just didn&#x27;t seem to actually brush all the hair down to the scalp.  </li>
      <li>Nice little brush my mother is bedridden</li>
      <li>Every time I use the brush, there are one to three bristles in the sink, and the &#x27;wood handle really feels like plastic.</li>
      <li>First it is small at about six inches so it fits nicely in my travel case.  </li>
      <li>The bristles are firm enough to replace my comb, and smooth enough to brush my hair to a nice sheen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My daughter is 15 months old and has a decent amount of hair.  </li>
      <li>Smaller and thinner than what I thought, which is exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>Second, at about one inch wide it is easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Typically boar brushes are not recommended for people with thick hair like mine, but I use this brush to smooth the top layer of my hair after teasing.</li>
      <li>I have a large boars hair brush for myself and noticed how it does not pull at tangles, so I got this smaller one for my toddler.</li>
      <li>The brush is very small, but okay for travel size I suppose.  </li>
      <li>I have thin, fine, straight hair and almost always use a natural bristle brush.</li>
      <li>It creates a smooth surface without disrupting the teasing underneath and the small size gives me the control I need.</li>
      <li>I know its supposed to be for fine hair, but it really just wont go through my hair, and my hair is thick and straight, not curly or anything hard really.  </li>
      <li>This one, while it is small enough to fit in a back pocket, isn&#x27;t as well made as my old one.</li>
      <li>big enough to do the job - yet small enough to easily fit in my travel bag.</li>

    <li> the bristles aren&#x27;t that sturdy, they are already starting to get bent out of shape, and it cannot get through my hair at all.  I know its supposed to be for fine hair, but it really just wont go through my hair, and my hair is thick and straight, not curly or anything hard really.  The brush is very small, but okay for travel size I suppose.  The bristles just aren&#x27;t that good of quality.</li>
    <li> I have a 20 year old boars hair brush that is still great. This one, while it is small enough to fit in a back pocket, isn&#x27;t as well made as my old one. Every time I use the brush, there are one to three bristles in the sink, and the &#x27;wood handle really feels like plastic. Still, does the job though.</li>
    <li> Brush is good quality but  the boar bristles wreak of a boar smell (much like javalena) -- soaking in ammonia and soap solution for an hour or so nearly eliminated the stink.</li>
    <li> .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Spornette Mini Deville is an excellent product.  I have used the larger model of the Deville for several years, and I like it. The large Deville is, however 3.5 inches wide and 10 inches long, so it is not very good for travel.  I decided I needed a smaller brush and one better for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Spornette Mini Deville is perfect for me.  First it is small at about six inches so it fits nicely in my travel case.  Second, at about one inch wide it is easy to use.  The handle has a grip that allows my fingers to get a firm hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are a great size and firmness for brushing my hair.  The bristles are firm enough to replace my comb, and smooth enough to brush my hair to a nice sheen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any of the problems mentioned by other reviewers.  My brush does not smell, and the bristles are great.  Maybe they improved the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this brush.  It is the best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This is a great little brush. I love the natural wood handle because it creates less static than plastic. Typically boar brushes are not recommended for people with thick hair like mine, but I use this brush to smooth the top layer of my hair after teasing. It works wonderfully for that. It creates a smooth surface without disrupting the teasing underneath and the small size gives me the control I need. I&#x27;m thinking of buying another to keep at the office.</li>
    <li> I just received the brush from Amazon. It is 6 &amp; 1/4 inches and is smaller than you might think. It feels fine but make sure it is the correct size that you need. I should have read the information better.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Spornette Mini Deville boar bristle brush for my husband who has fine hair. He wanted a brush to put in his travel kit. He is very happy with the quality as well as the size of the brush.</li>
    <li> You can stow this in a jacket pocket and have a good boar bristle brush while you&#x27;re out on the town.</li>
    <li> Love this type of brush,boar bristle is the best type of brush I have bought them in the past, would recommend to any one.</li>
    <li> Good quality hairbrush and perfect to take along for touch up when it is not convenient to take a larger brush.</li>
    <li> came before planned. exactly what I wanted. It will do a good job with my long hair- and it fits in my waist wallet.</li>
    <li> Soft boar bristles, good wooden handle. Just perfect to tuck into a suitcase for travel. There is no odor at all so I don&#x27;t understand what other reviewers could be referring to.</li>
    <li> My daughter is 15 months old and has a decent amount of hair.  I wasn&#x27;t happy with any of the baby hair brushes on the market, they were flimsy and just didn&#x27;t seem to actually brush all the hair down to the scalp.  This brush isn&#x27;t marketed as a baby&#x27;s hairbrush, but it is perfect for the job.  It isn&#x27;t too rough but it still brushes her hair.  We use it after bathtime and in the morning.  It is a quality product, the handle has a very nice feel.  My daughter loves to use it to try to brush her hair and mom&#x27;s &amp; dad&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Nice little brush my mother is bedridden so it is the perfect size to take care of her hair without hassle.</li>
    <li> I would love to see this Deville Rectangle in a medium size, the mini is fine for purse use but I need a larger brush with bristles.  I could not find the Deville medium size, though.</li>
    <li> I wanted to replace my 15 year old small Goody hairbrush and since I am significantly balding a small brush would work. This is very good quality with wood handle and boar bristles.  I may purchase another so I am good for the next 30 years.</li>
    <li> The perfect hair brush. I adore boar bristle hair brushes and this one fits in my Coach Penny bag so I have it with me always.</li>
    <li> I have a large boars hair brush for myself and noticed how it does not pull at tangles, so I got this smaller one for my toddler. Her hair is very fine too so his type of brush works well. If you have thick hair, boars hair will not comb through the hair. For us this works great!</li>
    <li> The absolute perfect size for traveling. Smaller and thinner than what I thought, which is exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine, straight hair and almost always use a natural bristle brush. This is a great size to keep in a purse but works almost as well on my hair as my large brush.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t change a thing about this brush:  big enough to do the job - yet small enough to easily fit in my travel bag.</li>
