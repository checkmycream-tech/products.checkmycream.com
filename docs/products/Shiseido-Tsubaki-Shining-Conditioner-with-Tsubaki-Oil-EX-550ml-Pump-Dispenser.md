      <li>I really like this conditioner-</li>
      <li>it really smoothes my hair.</li>
      <li>This conditioner makes your hair look like the conditioner commercials for reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Going through various different conditioners, in order to find what makes your hair the most soft, I originally settled with Aussie.  </li>
      <li>After the 3rd day, I started noticing my hair was becoming extremely soft and felt noticeably healthier.  </li>
      <li>For most of my life I&#x27;ve been buying typical drugstore hair products.</li>
      <li>I will definitely order more of this product from this seller in the future.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product and it&#x27;s actually cheaper than most asian stores in the US.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>My hair is fine and straight and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down but leaves it silky.</li>
      <li>It also really absorbs into my hair and keeps it soft post-shower as well.</li>
      <li>All the other conditioners that I&#x27;ve tried have not come close to how good this one is, and from the other reviews it sounds like it works for all hair types.</li>
      <li>In other words, my hair feels fabulous because of using this conditioner after shampooing.</li>
      <li>br /&gt;It untangles without weighing down my hair and it is very soft and full of health !</li>
      <li>It makes my hair silky, and the scent is very soft.</li>
      <li>br /&gt;Also, delivery was very fast and earlier than planned.</li>
      <li>Great smell but too heavy, left hair feeling limp and greasy.</li>
      <li>It is reasonably priced compared to similar salon products.  </li>
      <li>I ALWAYS use hair products made in Japan &amp; Korea because they have natural ingredients &amp; has no harmful chemical ingredients.</li>
      <li>However, this conditioner keeps my hair moisturized, soft, and shiny.</li>
      <li>Also I am Ukrainian, I moved to the USA about 10 years ago and this product so far it one I am still using.</li>
      <li>Shiseido completely suprised me.</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally curly and wavy - which also means it boycotts moisture.</li>
      <li>If you flat iron the shampoo along with the conditioner will make the task much easier.  </li>
      <li>, now I use it everyday and my hair is always super silky and soft.  </li>
      <li>Although I think I need something more as my hair is coarse and dry due to perming etc.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a male with normal hair.</li>
      <li>My hair is very coarse but after one wash, my hair came out so soft and bouncy.  </li>
      <li>I have went through numerous salon brand conditioners, and none of them have ever made my hair this soft or manageable.  </li>
      <li>keep my hair sily soft and no more frizzy hair first day after the wash.</li>
      <li>I have thin, medium length, straight hair - which tends to be dry and a victim to static.</li>
      <li>But if you have normal unprocessed hair</li>
      <li>After you fall in love with this silicone-based conditioner, buy the refill pouches which are less expensive (just search &amp;#34;tsubaki refill&amp;#34;), and eco-friendly to boot:</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got hooked on this shampoo and conditioner during a trip to Tokyo last year.  The hotel had the product in the shower and I used it for 10 days.  After the 3rd day, I started noticing my hair was becoming extremely soft and felt noticeably healthier.  Now, I&#x27;m a guy...I don&#x27;t buy hair products...ever.  I usually use whatever is in the hotel and then I keep extra shampoos for my home use.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve bought shampoo in 10 years!  But I was blown away by this product.  I gave away all my \\&quot;hotel\\&quot; shampoos and invested in this product and I can honestly say I&#x27;ve been greatly impressed by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this shampoo and conditioner.  It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> For most of my life I&#x27;ve been buying typical drugstore hair products. However, a few years ago I was introduced to the Tsubaki Oil Conditioner. I was already familiar with the Shiseido make-up line (which is one of my favorites) so I decided to give the conditioner a try. I was blown away by how amazing it is. I have thin, medium length, straight hair - which tends to be dry and a victim to static. However, this conditioner keeps my hair moisturized, soft, and shiny. All the other conditioners that I&#x27;ve tried have not come close to how good this one is, and from the other reviews it sounds like it works for all hair types.</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with this conditioner. The shine and softness is really noticeable. I experiment a lot with conditioner and I&#x27;ve been using this brand for months. Far longer than any other purchase. I&#x27;m a male with normal hair. I heard if you have oily hair this may not be the best choice, but I cannot speak to that. This conditioner makes your hair look like the conditioner commercials for reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I was happy to find that Amazon carries the Shiseido hair products after initially purchasing at an Asian grocery store.  It is reasonably priced compared to similar salon products.  If you flat iron the shampoo along with the conditioner will make the task much easier.  The shampoo has a great lather and the conditioner will make your hair shine.  Also, there is a damage repair version of hair care available.  Only reason not rated a 5 is there&#x27;s always room for price improvement.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff. Even in humid weather, my hair feels light and shiny. I will certainly purchase this item again</li>
    <li> Great quality conditioner for dry and very dry hair. Makes hair feel light and soft, leaves the shiny but not greasy. I use it a few times a week and it makes my hair healthy and happy.</li>
    <li> As my hair has been getting longer, I&#x27;ve been having issues with tangles. Soon after I would detangle my hair and put conditioner on it, I would find my hair tangled again. But this conditioner is DIFFERENT!&lt;br /&gt;Not only did this keep my hair from getting tangled, it helped with the dryness and left my hair smelling great! I just ordered another bottle of this recently. Had I&#x27;d seen this when I was in Japan last summer, I would have brought a ton of it back with me! (--_--;)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an African American with thick 3c/4a hair.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to another shampoo that contains tsubaki oil in it and thought it couldn&#x27;t get better than that for my hair. However, it was hard to find and almost double the price at half the amount to purchase it through HSN. I ordered the Shiseido Tsubaki Shampoo and Conditioner with the pump dispenser 550ml and fell in love. Shiseido completely suprised me. It works far better than anything I have tried and it smells wonderful. Would advise to anyone to try. My hair is naturally curly and wavy - which also means it boycotts moisture. The Shiseido product has given me shiny, healthy and easily manageable hair for the first time in my life.</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely THE BEST!!  I have went through numerous salon brand conditioners, and none of them have ever made my hair this soft or manageable.  I have very long hair that tangles and gets matted very easily.  Since using this product, my hair no longer requires as many brushing throughout the day.  My hair also used to \\&quot;poof out\\&quot; and get flyaways, but no longer.  Your hair will feel like silk!</li>
    <li> I was amazed that I received my order so quickly.  I have bought the Tsubaki regular conditioner before, but not the Shining conditioner.  I have very long hair and was very pleased with how silky and shiny my hair looked after using it.  It smells very nice, too.  I use hot rollers in my hair and the curl stayed in just fine with this conditioner.  I will definitely order more of this product from this seller in the future.</li>
    <li> Ever since I bought this conditioner last year in Japan I haven&#x27;t used anything else since.  Going through various different conditioners, in order to find what makes your hair the most soft, I originally settled with Aussie.  However once in Japan my hair got rather out of control with the humidity and was in need of something with a deep moisturiser.  Thusly I did some research and found this product and promptly bought, now I use it everyday and my hair is always super silky and soft.  I highly recommend this product and it&#x27;s actually cheaper than most asian stores in the US.</li>
    <li> For years I have been searching for the right hair conditioner for my thick, course, Asian hair. I have wasted so much money trying on different products, and have always used only a small portion of the bottles before getting some other new conditioners. At last.....I finally found a conditioner that is perfect for my hair. I am currently using the 2nd bottle of Shiseido Tsubaki Shining Conditioner. This product is amazing! It gives me back the hair I had when I was in my 20&#x27;s. I am now 43, and my hair feels extremely soft &amp; it looks healthy and shiny. I don&#x27;t think you necessarily have to use the Tsubaki shampoo. I was using Aveda Shampure shampoo w/ the 1st bottle, and I am now using the Tsubaki Shining Shampoo. Frankly, I cannot tell the difference. In other words, my hair feels fabulous because of using this conditioner after shampooing.</li>
    <li> I bought the shampoo/conditioner together. My hair is very coarse but after one wash, my hair came out so soft and bouncy.  The conditioner did not make my hair feel heavy.  The smell is heavenly.  I wish they would make a  body wash to go with it.</li>
    <li> Really love this product. Wish they would label in english</li>
    <li> I bought this product in Japan on a trip because it was inexpensive there. I absolutely love it and wish that I had bought more. It really makes me hair silky and smooth and it smells really good!</li>
    <li> it really smoothes my hair. i really love it. i think it should be used everyday with other Tsubaki products.</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t want anyone buyng this product because I want it all for myself. It&#x27;s just outstanding!</li>
    <li> I really like this conditioner- it has great slip, creamy in texture, and smells heavenly. Up there with the top conditioners that I have used.  Just ordered my 2nd bottle...</li>
    <li> When my hair gets dry this is my go too product. I have very thin hair and I had 3 times done Japanese hair straitening . Also I am Ukrainian, I moved to the USA about 10 years ago and this product so far it one I am still using.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is very thick and does an excellent job moisturizing my hair. It also really absorbs into my hair and keeps it soft post-shower as well.</li>
    <li> keep my hair sily soft and no more frizzy hair first day after the wash. I don&#x27;t even need to blow dry or iron flat my hair anymore to keep it in place.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and it does make my hair feel softer.  Although I think I need something more as my hair is coarse and dry due to perming etc.  But if you have normal unprocessed hair I think it works great.  A little goes a long way.  I will try the one for Damaged hair and see if it is better for my hair texture.</li>
    <li> makes my hair smell really nice and it makes my hair pretty soft. i only need 2 pumps to condition all of my hair so i feel like it will last longer than my current conditioner. i am currently also using biolage&#x27;s conditioner.</li>
    <li> I am happy this conditioner works well on my hair - I have about 100 gray ones.  I like the pump in my shower.</li>
    <li> I first tried this Tsubaki at a friend&#x27;s place (who happened to be a heterosexual male), and loved how it made my hair feel. After just one wash with the shampoo and conditioner, My hair actually did feel softer, silkier and more manageable. My flyaways even seem improved. I did find the same product at my local Korean market, so I bought the shampoo there. It&#x27;s pricier than the shampoo/conditioners I&#x27;ve used in the past, but compared to other salon products, it&#x27;s quite reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> made my hair fall like crazy</li>
    <li> Great smell but too heavy, left hair feeling limp and greasy. Arrived quickly and came as described but just not for my fine hair, might be better for thicker coarse hair.</li>
    <li> Fake! I have bought the same conditioner before and they are totally different!</li>
    <li> It makes my hair silky, and the scent is very soft. I like it and will not turn to other conditioner in the future.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair a little to weighed down for my liking</li>
    <li> After you fall in love with this silicone-based conditioner, buy the refill pouches which are less expensive (just search &amp;#34;tsubaki refill&amp;#34;), and eco-friendly to boot: [[ASIN:B0016KARKQ Shiseido Fitit Tsubaki Conditioner 400ml Refill]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have fine/flat hair, this is not for you. It&#x27;s works better on unruly/coarse/frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If travelling to Asia, pick up a refill pouch at any drugstore---one refill fills up an entire empty Tsubaki container, with no leftovers to worry about.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every expensive shampoo and conditioner out there. This actually works. It makes my hair soft and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  They are reasonably priced for fantastic results and a nice smell too. My hair is fine and straight and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down but leaves it silky.</li>
    <li> Works wonders for thick asian hair. Loosens it up so it can actually be styled. Have just started using it so haven&#x27;t noticed any long term side effects. Will post if I do.</li>
    <li> I have relaxed hair that tends to get very dry.  This conditioner is very effective.  I usually leave it on for 30 minutes or so while sitting under a hood dryer.  I then rinse and put a bit more on in the shower, which I leave on for three minutes or so and then rinse again.  It works very well and the scent is marvelous.</li>
    <li> Shiseido is a good product beauty line to begin with. I ALWAYS use hair products made in Japan &amp; Korea because they have natural ingredients &amp; has no harmful chemical ingredients. It works amazingly good with my hair.</li>
    <li> I have highlighted hair, which tends to dry out. This conditioner used with Tsubaki shampoo has revitalized my hair. My&lt;br /&gt;hair is much more hydrated, soft, shiny and gets better with each use. Great product.</li>
    <li> The only shampoo my granddaughter will use, the price is unbeatable</li>
    <li> I always used  a quality conditioner on my long curly hair but this one is the best of all !&lt;br /&gt;It untangles without weighing down my hair and it is very soft and full of health ! (No need to put a lot)&lt;br /&gt;I love it and I recommend it !&lt;br /&gt;Also, delivery was very fast and earlier than planned.</li>
