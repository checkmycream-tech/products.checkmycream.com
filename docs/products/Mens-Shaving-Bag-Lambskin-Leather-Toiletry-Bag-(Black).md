      <li>This is a great bag with more than enough room for everything I need!</li>

      <li>At 10&#x27;&#x27; it&#x27;s larger than what I would call a standard toiletries bag, taking up more room than you might want in your carry-on bag.</li>
      <li>the old one was thrown out the moment he said that he likes the new leather toiletry travel bag.....and wants to keep it!</li>
      <li>my son-in-law loves his new &amp;#34;man-bag&amp;#34;.</li>

      <li>Very soft texture.</li>
      <li>Has several pockets within the bottom large pocket.</li>

      <li>I have a razor in a DriBlade case, shaving cream, face wash stuff, comb, hair product (in quite a big tube), toothbrush and paste, plus a few more items here</li>
      <li>The leather is yummy and soft, and despite it&#x27;s rather small size, it holds many necessary things.</li>
      <li>It is well made, feels soft but looks very durable and should last a long, long time....</li>

    <li> We had been looking for something like this for a while, and this one fits the bill. The leather is yummy and soft, and despite it&#x27;s rather small size, it holds many necessary things. My husband is happy! Amazon again came through with the best of the best!</li>
    <li> Very soft texture. Came packaged nicely as well. Has several pockets within the bottom large pocket. All outside pockets have zippers on them. This was a gift to my husband.</li>
    <li> I bring it on all my trips. Fits EVERYTHING</li>
    <li> It has a really strong odor to it. I have kept it in the garage to try and air it out.</li>
    <li> A gift for dah hubby......the old one was thrown out the moment he said that he likes the new leather toiletry travel bag.....and wants to keep it!</li>
    <li> Good material but a bit bulky...</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Nice and roomy and well made.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this travel bag. The leather is soft and the bag is super roomy. He also loves the extra compartment at the bottom. Anyway, longevity is the best measure of quality in my book so hopefully this lasts many years. I&#x27;ll update this review if it doesn&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> Nice size, genuine leather, but thought it was going to be larger.  Zippers stick a little.  The bottom compartment has elastic loops for holding items, and there&#x27;s mesh/elastic pockets as well.  Main compartment has a zippered inner compartment that wasn&#x27;t mentioned anywhere, but is a nice touch.  Leather is nice and soft, has a good feel to it, but stitching leaves a little to be desired.</li>
    <li> Nice bag and nice construction. Was a great gift for my guy.</li>
    <li> This is a great bag with more than enough room for everything I need!

    <li> What a great travel bag.  My husband loved it.  He hasn&#x27;t had a new one in 20 years (old one was good too).  This one had a very good amount of space and a bonus zippered bottom where he could put some extras.  Leather is very nice.  Shipping was excellent.</li>
    <li> Read the description to make sure it&#x27;s what you want. Very soft leather, somewhat shapeless, arrived folded flat in an envelope. At 10&#x27;&#x27; it&#x27;s larger than what I would call a standard toiletries bag, taking up more room than you might want in your carry-on bag. Bottom has  useful separate parts. Made in India.</li>
    <li> Toiletry bag is exactly as described--soft, durable, and good-sized.</li>
    <li> We needed a replacement toiletry bag.  We are very satisfied with this purchase.  Would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Well constructed and soft leather.</li>
