      <li>The straightener wasn&#x27;t that great.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it even works as great as everyone says it does.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even own a curling iron, but with this, my curls come out perfectly.</li>

      <li>I love making curls with it!</li>
      <li>I recommend it for sure!</li>
      <li>Btw, this was my first attempt to purchase anything from Amazon, and it wasn&#x27;t very a great experience.</li>
      <li>Love it, I had no idea my kinky, frizzy hair could ever look this good.  </li>
      <li>I have used a chi and own a babyliss pro.</li>
      <li>And best of all super easy to use.</li>
      <li>I got pretty ideal results</li>
      <li>Great really like this product never will use another flat iron great product to have and use happy happy cusyomer</li>
      <li>Buy this iron in the mall a few years ago for $ 120 works perfectly, the problem was that used before a trip and forget to turn it off luckily was within its protective cover because I spend 3 days on, still works just that aspect not the best</li>
      <li>It is beyond excellent leaves my hair perfectly straight and smooth.  </li>
      <li>It works great, my hair comes out pretty shiny and it flows.</li>
      <li>but it works too well to mind that :)</li>
      <li>hope I can save you a headeach :)</li>
      <li>My sister, however, has curly hair, so this doesn&#x27;t work as magically for her.</li>
      <li>I love how I never get split ends from this straightener.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had the item for, the more hair it snags off.</li>
      <li>I only needed one pass per section for perfect smoothness.  </li>
      <li>but this product is not a miracle worker (I, for one, say the CHI is better).  </li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this straightener.</li>
      <li>but if you have the cash, go for something better.</li>
      <li>Then I decide to buy one for myself and I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still working great-- though not as amazing as when I first got it, but hey, still pretty fantastic.</li>
      <li>They make my hair feel super soft and I can creat beautiful curls with them.</li>
      <li>It may work fine for someone who has straighter hair to begin with,</li>
      <li>It worked wonderful at first but by a year or two later it stopped working well.  </li>
      <li>You can understand my anxiety about my other purchases, but today I received them both in great condition, new and un-used, and happy with my choices.  </li>
      <li>I was appauled at the cheap quality of the iron.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s honestly fantastic.</li>
      <li>But the cool thing about it is that it curls your hair pretty nice</li>
      <li>I have also noticed, whenever my hair is more full (from not being able to get a hair cut) and is at a medium length, it doesn&#x27;t pull out so much hair.</li>
      <li>Very nice flat iron.</li>
      <li>For the first time, I was even able to curl my hair with this.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best brand of flat iron that I have every used.</li>
      <li>I brought this straightner online about 2-3 years ago for $120 and the thing that caught my attention was the pink color and watching the youtube videos about it lol</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t believe this is a true Corioliss.  </li>
      <li>In short, if you are going to make a purchase at amazon, buy from a vendor who got good ratings and gets shipped through Amazon.</li>
      <li>so I needed a quick, inexpensive replacement.  </li>
      <li>All the reviews I read were pretty 50/50, so I assumed the people writing reviews couldn&#x27;t ALL be paid salespeople!  </li>
      <li>I also think it leaves my hair more frizzy looking than my old Corioliss.  </li>
      <li>It gives me the result that I want and it was worth every penny.</li>
      <li>The iron&#x27;s heat settings were really hot and it would easily glide through my hair making it sleek and very glossy.</li>
      <li>Worked quickly and very well.</li>
      <li>I have own a real Corioliss for over 6 years, till it finally was dropped and ran over by a car (accidentally, of course)</li>
      <li>I got exactly what I paid for.  </li>
      <li>Only when I get shorter cuts and thinned my hair by having tons of layers, that&#x27;s when I lose more hair from the straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, my hair is already pretty straight/wavy, I just have A LOT of it.</li>
      <li>I made this purchase three years ago and wish I bought another one as a back up, but seeing the price has tripled since my purchase, I need to take better care of the straightener!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I was amazed the first time my stylist used it.</li>
      <li>First, the product came in pieces, yes the plates were no longer attached to the handle.  </li>
      <li>This is not something new to me; it has always snagged off my hair, but more frequently now than before.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m Chinese with thick semi-course hair, so the temperature the tool is perfect for the texture of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I give it four stars only because after that I think it is important that after a certain time of use auntomaticamente turn off.</li>
      <li>Well too this day i still have this straightner but don&#x27;t really like it cause you can&#x27;t adjust temperature</li>
      <li>The plates didn&#x27;t heat up as much and never made my hair straight.  </li>
      <li>(Mine is natually curly) but I would have expected better with the name brand of Corioliss.  </li>
      <li>but please dont bother buying unless you have straight hair.</li>
      <li>Works better than any other I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
      <li>Now I know why the flat iron does not work like the original which I did purchase one from the mall.</li>
      <li>I would say this is a decent purchase for the price</li>
      <li>I will keep it as a back up, but plan on looking into purchasing something better in the future.</li>
      <li>Only dislike, the heat has no setting and the iron get VERY hot.</li>
      <li>And the thing that it gets a little too hot if left on for so long lol</li>
      <li>and I am looking for a new one.   </li>
      <li>but my sister wanted exchange for a new one.  </li>
      <li>I doesn&#x27;t seem to smooth it over as well as I would expect that it should even with several passes over the same section of hair.  </li>
      <li>The plates are very small and do not get hot enough to be effective.</li>
      <li>all, I would definitely repurchase this tool again (if it goes back for the price I originally paid for) and recommend it to family and friends.</li>
      <li>I contacted the Corioliss company directly and was advised by a representative that the Corioliss brand is only available to purchase through local malls.</li>
      <li>My hair gets a little frizzy while using it, but it&#x27;s manageable and easy to fix.</li>
      <li>The packaging looked very generic leading me to believe that this flat iron was a replica of the original.</li>
      <li>I love this iron enough to track it down before mine dies.  </li>
      <li>I have owned a Corioliss flat iron before exactly like the one I purchased.  </li>
      <li>All I can say is do not waste your money on this product.  </li>
      <li>my old one did.  </li>
      <li>I really like this flat iron.</li>
      <li>I brought the flat irons to use on my daughter since I really like the way her hair came out when the stylist at the salon flattened her hair.  </li>
      <li>My friend bought the same straighter from a temporary booth in a shopping mall and mine works exactly the same as hers.</li>
      <li>I have very fine, thin hair</li>
      <li>Hopefully the next one we get it will be brand new.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Buy this iron in the mall a few years ago for $ 120 works perfectly, the problem was that used before a trip and forget to turn it off luckily was within its protective cover because I spend 3 days on, still works just that aspect not the best and I am looking for a new one.   I give it four stars only because after that I think it is important that after a certain time of use auntomaticamente turn off.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron a month ago...and I absolutely love it. I use it everyday, and after straightening my hair in the morning, it lasts for the entire day without looking too flat or greasy at the end of the day. My hair gets a little frizzy while using it, but it&#x27;s manageable and easy to fix. For the first time, I was even able to curl my hair with this. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I got this flat iron for christmas one year.  I believe it is one that they sell in kiosks in the mall if it isn&#x27;t then my mistake.  It worked wonderful at first but by a year or two later it stopped working well.  The plates didn&#x27;t heat up as much and never made my hair straight.  I have thick natural curly hair so it was just  a pain to have to use.</li>
    <li> I was not satisfied with the product. The packaging looked very generic leading me to believe that this flat iron was a replica of the original. I contacted the Corioliss company directly and was advised by a representative that the Corioliss brand is only available to purchase through local malls. I am very disappointed that I was sold a replica of this item. Now I know why the flat iron does not work like the original which I did purchase one from the mall.</li>
    <li> I bought mine off Ebay for $40 and it&#x27;s honestly fantastic. I don&#x27;t flatiron my hair often because it&#x27;s a pain to do it, but I do prefer using this iron to my Herstyler flatiron. It works great, my hair comes out pretty shiny and it flows. Just always use a heat protectant, and this flatiron is your best friend. I also use this to curl my hair. I don&#x27;t even own a curling iron, but with this, my curls come out perfectly.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a christmas present for my teenage daughter.  Deliverly was swift and the price cant be beat,  Thank You</li>
    <li> This iron was a great item for the price! I love making curls with it!</li>
    <li> I had tried this iron in my friend&#x27;s home and I loved it! Then I decide to buy one for myself and I&#x27;m in love with it. I recommend it for sure!</li>
    <li> I bought the Pink Corioliss Flat Iron *seven years ago* at a kiosk in the mall. It&#x27;s still working great-- though not as amazing as when I first got it, but hey, still pretty fantastic. I like that it doesnt make my hair feel like plastic like the $20 ones you can get at Walmart. It feels hydrated and lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;However, my hair is already pretty straight/wavy, I just have A LOT of it. I can get great results with towel drying and straightening. My sister, however, has curly hair, so this doesn&#x27;t work as magically for her. She has to spend hours blow-drying and straightening by section.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great investment for me. :)</li>
    <li> With in the fist month this item started smelling like smoke and it almost caught up on fire. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE.</li>
    <li> My hairdressser uses one of these on my hair every time I get a cut and style.  I have very fine, thin hair and I was amazed the first time my stylist used it. My hair didn&#x27;t look flat at all.   So, I bought this one but was not successful with it.  Plus, this one does not have a temperature control. It&#x27;s probably a great product, it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> My Cricket flat iron had cracked plates so I needed a quick, inexpensive replacement.  I had never heard of the Corioliss before and was alarmed by the shifty mall kiosk marketing stories and lack of website info (see for yourself!). All the reviews I read were pretty 50/50, so I assumed the people writing reviews couldn&#x27;t ALL be paid salespeople!  I took a chance and bought it.    **NOWHERE ON THIS PRODUCT DOES IT SAY \\&quot;PRO FIX\\&quot;** It could be just mine but I looked the product up on youtube and my packaging and box look NOTHING like the one in the video (mine only says \\&quot;pro\\&quot; and pink box instead of black). I don&#x27;t know or care what \\&quot;FIX\\&quot; means but it is unfortunate that the product being advertised is not the one being distributed.  Also, it made a few little hissing noises when heating up and smells a bit like Play-Doh.     That aside, this iron worked well for my very thick curly/wavy hair.  I only needed one pass per section for perfect smoothness.  The fact that there is no temp dial does not bother me because I always use my flat iron on the highest setting or my hair will not straighten. I got pretty ideal results but this product is not a miracle worker (I, for one, say the CHI is better).  I would say this is a decent purchase for the price but if you have the cash, go for something better.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this straightener. Works better than any other I&#x27;ve used before. My only complaint is that it left a little bit of a static cling to my hair. Worked quickly and very well. Colors not so great either, look like pepto pink... but it works too well to mind that :)</li>
    <li> I bought a Corioliss Pro Fix Iron in the past.  When I received this iron I knew it wasn&#x27;t the same one.  First of all, it doesn&#x27;t even come in the black Corioliss Prof Fix box.  It comes in a pink one &amp; it&#x27;s the classic Corioliss.  Don&#x27;t advertise that it&#x27;s a Pro Fix when it&#x27;s NOT!</li>
    <li> Not happy with the purchased of this product. It was a gift for my sister for Christmas.  I will have return the merchandise back and get my money back but my sister wanted exchange for a new one.  The Flat Iron never reached the temperature to be used and it smell like it was burning.  Iron also looked like it was used or even damaged. Hopefully the next one we get it will be brand new.</li>
    <li> I have owned a Corioliss flat iron before exactly like the one I purchased.  When I ordered this one, I was skeptical about how inexpensive it was.  I got exactly what I paid for.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to heat up as well as my old one did.  I also think it leaves my hair more frizzy looking than my old Corioliss.  I doesn&#x27;t seem to smooth it over as well as I would expect that it should even with several passes over the same section of hair.  It may work fine for someone who has straighter hair to begin with, (Mine is natually curly) but I would have expected better with the name brand of Corioliss.  I don&#x27;t know if this is a factory second or reclaimed from the scrap pile, but it isn&#x27;t what I was hoping I would get.  I will keep it as a back up, but plan on looking into purchasing something better in the future.</li>
    <li> Love it, I had no idea my kinky, frizzy hair could ever look this good.  And best of all super easy to use.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because my sister has a Corioliss and works great. I can tell you this is either a fake or on of the cheapest that corioliss has but please dont bother buying unless you have straight hair. I have thin curley hair with little frizz. The iron will iron my hair but the next day is waivy. ALSO IT DOESNT have temperature control so you turn it on and thats all you get. I found out that my sister has the Tourmaline Corioliss and maybe that makes a diference or this is a fake. DO YOUR RESEARCH! hope I can save you a headeach :)</li>
    <li> Great really like this product never will use another flat iron great product to have and use happy happy cusyomer</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe this is a true Corioliss.  I would not order this again.  I don&#x27;t think it does not work as well.</li>
    <li> I have used a chi and own a babyliss pro. I really like this flat iron. I only use it to curl my hair though. It needs a way to control the heat temp but works great and it was a wonderful price.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for the same iron I bought 7 years ago.  I love this iron enough to track it down before mine dies.  It is beyond excellent leaves my hair perfectly straight and smooth.  I would recommend without hesitation.  It also got here on time had no delivery issues.  It&#x27;s all good!</li>
    <li> I brought this straightner online about 2-3 years ago for $120 and the thing that caught my attention was the pink color and watching the youtube videos about it lol Knowing back then i was clueless about straightners so i didnt think twice and bought it. Well too this day i still have this straightner but don&#x27;t really like it cause you can&#x27;t adjust temperature so you just have to stick with whatever it has. And the thing that it gets a little too hot if left on for so long lol But the cool thing about it is that it curls your hair pretty nice but the straightning is not so awesome. I&#x27;ve used better straightners then this and are much less expensive then these.</li>
    <li> I was appauled at the cheap quality of the iron.  It did not straighten my hair. I don&#x27;t know if it was defective or if this is just how it is made.  All I can say is do not waste your money on this product.  The plates are very small and do not get hot enough to be effective.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron over 8 years and I use it every week it  is perfect.  It gives me the result that I want and it was worth every penny. My hair is not damaged from using the iron.  Good buy!</li>
    <li> The advertisement I saw said this was a $200+ flat iron going for around $36.00  I thought I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.  I was wrong!  This flat iron is not a good deal, even at that amount.  It doesn&#x27;t heat up well.  I am now going to keep it just as a spare.</li>
    <li> Very nice flat iron. Salon quality. Only dislike, the heat has no setting and the iron get VERY hot. I would buy this brand again but look for one with heat settings</li>
    <li> I made this purchase three years ago and wish I bought another one as a back up, but seeing the price has tripled since my purchase, I need to take better care of the straightener!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was recommended to me by a coworker who already owned one for two years. This keeps my hair straight for at least 5-6 hours throughout the day (my hair tends to curl out at my neck no matter what I do to it). I love how I never get split ends from this straightener. There might be a lot of straighteners claiming to have ceramic plates, but few actually keeps your hair from getting too much damage. Other buyers complains about the non-adjustable heat setting but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. I&#x27;m Chinese with thick semi-course hair, so the temperature the tool is perfect for the texture of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that bothers me about the straightener is the longer I&#x27;ve had the item for, the more hair it snags off. This is not something new to me; it has always snagged off my hair, but more frequently now than before. I have also noticed, whenever my hair is more full (from not being able to get a hair cut) and is at a medium length, it doesn&#x27;t pull out so much hair. Only when I get shorter cuts and thinned my hair by having tons of layers, that&#x27;s when I lose more hair from the straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I would definitely repurchase this tool again (if it goes back for the price I originally paid for) and recommend it to family and friends.</li>
    <li> I actually used to work at the mall selling these. I paid $90 for one and it was suppose to last for \\&quot;life\\&quot; and have a \\&quot;warranty\\&quot; it was a waste of money. It was great for the first few months, but after that it was horrible, the curls never held, and after a year the plate fell out for NO reason. POS.</li>
    <li> This is my third corioliss flat iron. This is by far the best brand of flat iron that I have every used. I keep one in both of my travel bags so that I can always have great hair days. This iron works on all grades of hair, and doesnt burn.</li>
    <li> The straightener wasn&#x27;t that great. It doesn&#x27;t come with the heat settings. I don&#x27;t think it even works as great as everyone says it does.</li>
    <li> I love these flatirons!! They make my hair feel super soft and I can creat beautiful curls with them. I would definitely recommend them. I just wish you could adjust the temperature</li>
    <li> My friend bought the same straighter from a temporary booth in a shopping mall and mine works exactly the same as hers.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from private seller, what a waste of time and money. Btw, this was my first attempt to purchase anything from Amazon, and it wasn&#x27;t very a great experience. First, the product came in pieces, yes the plates were no longer attached to the handle.  On top of that, even if the product wasn&#x27;t broken, it was well used, by the seller before a sucker like me took it off her hands. Mind you, the Corioliss flat iron was listed as new but there was a side note that did mention few scratches. As a hardcore shopper that I am, in consecutive days, I had also purchased an Izunami KTX 450, and the Onei MK Halo from Amazon.  You can understand my anxiety about my other purchases, but today I received them both in great condition, new and un-used, and happy with my choices.  I brought the flat irons to use on my daughter since I really like the way her hair came out when the stylist at the salon flattened her hair.  In short, if you are going to make a purchase at amazon, buy from a vendor who got good ratings and gets shipped through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have own a real Corioliss for over 6 years, till it finally was dropped and ran over by a car (accidentally, of course) The iron&#x27;s heat settings were really hot and it would easily glide through my hair making it sleek and very glossy. it would also give me the perfect curls... THIS IRON which is a replica of the same model that I originally owned, sucks! It is just horrible and i am sending it back...  I wish there was a way to confirm if this product was legitimate &#x3D;/</li>
