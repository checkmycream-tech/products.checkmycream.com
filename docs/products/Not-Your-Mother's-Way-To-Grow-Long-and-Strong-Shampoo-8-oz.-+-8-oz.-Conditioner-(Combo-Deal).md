      <li>great product and easy transaction.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i thought smeled really nice</li>
      <li>It was like a very strong version of Bed Head&#x27;s Rock Star shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was like a very strong version of Bed Head&#x27;s Rock Star shampoo.  </li>
      <li>bought this for my 10 year old and it has made her hair very healthy and helps great with tangles.</li>
      <li>I literally used this once, and my hair feels 30000 times better than it did before I got in the shower.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell stays in your hair which is a nice light smell.</li>
      <li>Will be ordering more.</li>
      <li>This product is magical.</li>
      <li>i was very happy with it,will definitely order again</li>
      <li>smells very clean.</li>
      <li>but the chemically made apple smell was nice at first</li>
      <li>and I feel a huge difference in my hair ...</li>
      <li>Bought it for my daughter because it makes my hair look absolutely healthy and shiny, and it&#x27;s grown so much!</li>
      <li>I think the problem is twofold: 1) the shampoo is too strong, drying the hair, and 2) the conditioner doesn&#x27;t sink into the hair as much as the Humectress conditioner I was using before, so when I would brush my hair, the brush didn&#x27;t slide through as easily, which put stress on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so I have do them more often because of how fast my hair is growning.</li>
      <li>I use mostly just the shampoo and my hair grew really fast</li>
      <li>But when I actually used it in the shower, it was very overwhelming.</li>
      <li>Very pretty smell that lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>But my hair feels healthier from the first two washes!</li>
      <li>So far I love the way my hair feels after using the products.</li>
      <li>which is made with natural indredience that is much better for your hair and</li>
      <li>I record length on my calendar to keep track of what changes the amount of growth, so I figured I would be a good test subject for this product.</li>
      <li>i got in  the shower and used it for the first time.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love the smell and the fact that its sulfate-free, but it leaves my hair feeling like there is leftover product in it, especially when I try heat styling after washing.</li>
      <li>Then I started noticing that the conditioner had a funny smell to it.</li>
      <li>Within two weeks, my hair has grown about an inch, which is an absolute record for me!</li>
      <li>love my long hair.</li>
      <li>After giving 11inches of hair to locks of love I really missed my long locks.</li>
      <li>My hairdresser even commented on the new hair growth that I have!</li>
      <li>The first time it happened, I actually rewashed my hair because I thought I had accidentally missed washing some of it out the first time.</li>
      <li>It was kind of slimy i noticed and hard to rub</li>
      <li>first I used the NYM without the Aphogee, went back to my regular products for 2 months, and then used the NYM again with the Aphogee just to make sure that it was actually the NYM and not the lack of Aphogee that was hindering the growth.</li>
      <li>For the rare times I do need a lather (usually because I have dye or product buildup), I use the Acure Organics Morroccan Oil Shampoo and Conditioner, which is very gentle.</li>
      <li>For the rare times I do need a lather (usually because I have dye or product buildup), I use the Acure Organics Morroccan Oil Shampoo and Conditioner, which is very gentle.</li>
      <li>Also the conditioner does not leave my hair feeling sleek or soft which I prefer from my conditioner.  </li>
      <li>When I used the Aphogee with the NYM, I had just barely over an inch in growth, so the Aphogee did improve the results.</li>
      <li>Have only used once so far.  </li>
      <li>Previous to using this my hair felt like straw, this morning I have never ever felt it so silky and smooth, havnt used it long enough to report on the growth part of it, but the moisturizing effects of this product are miraculous</li>
      <li>Thin, easily breakable hair to start and after a month or so its the same.</li>
      <li>it is so soft even after I blow dry and flat iron</li>

    <li> I have only washed my hair twice and I feel a huge difference in my hair ...it is so soft even after I blow dry and flat iron my hair it was so silky. ..I think I&#x27;m going to use this shampoo and conditioner from now on!</li>
    <li> For the growing, this product definitely did help me.  I have thick medium-long hair.  However, this product dried out my scalp.  Also the conditioner does not leave my hair feeling sleek or soft which I prefer from my conditioner.  I only would buy this again if I got a bad haircut and wanted to grow my hair out quickly.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner were great for about a week. Then I started noticing that the conditioner had a funny smell to it. A few days later it was completely rancid and I could not use it anymore. Sad because I did really like it.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I have been using both of the products for 3 months. After giving 11inches of hair to locks of love I really missed my long locks. This product is magical. My hair was up to my ears and now it&#x27;s to the tops of my shoulders. I get highlights too so I have do them more often because of how fast my hair is growning. Love this you should get it!</li>
    <li> Great product. I use mostly just the shampoo and my hair grew really fast</li>
    <li> My husband bought this to grow out his hair, and he is also taking Biotin vitamins.  I love it! I want to get some for myself!  It smells like flowers and he doesnt seem to mind it.  If he walks by I can smell a scent of roses or something.  Very pretty smell that lasts all day.  Good deal for the set of 2. Used for a month and very happy with it.  Will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the fact that its sulfate-free, but it leaves my hair feeling like there is leftover product in it, especially when I try heat styling after washing. Not sure if that&#x27;s a result of them together, or shampoo/conditioner separately though. The first time it happened, I actually rewashed my hair because I thought I had accidentally missed washing some of it out the first time. Same result when I began blow drying and then straightening was out of the question - my hair just felt really weird like I hadn&#x27;t washed it at all. Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen a difference in the strength or length of my hair, either. Thin, easily breakable hair to start and after a month or so its the same. Too bad :(</li>
    <li> Purchased shampoo and conditioner recently. Shipping was on time if not earlier than expected. So far I love the way my hair feels after using the products. Smells good too! I&#x27;m hoping by the end of the month or the time I use them up i can tell a difference in length. But my hair feels healthier from the first two washes!</li>
    <li> this product is AMAZING! I had really long hair already. it was past my breasts. I wanted longer hair that grew to my hips so I tried this out and used it for a month and it grew 3 inches!!!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my daughter because it makes my hair look absolutely healthy and shiny, and it&#x27;s grown so much!</li>
    <li> Ordered this 4 days ago and it&#x27;s already here yay...let&#x27;s see how this works...</li>
    <li> bought this for my 10 year old and it has made her hair very healthy and helps great with tangles. her hair has looked the healthiest using this conditioner. commercial, salon shine. smells very clean. thumbs up!!</li>
    <li> I literally used this once, and my hair feels 30000 times better than it did before I got in the shower.

    <li> It is yet to be determined if this shampoo works as promised, but I do not like the smell!!!!!  It smells like those My Little Ponies that smelled like Strawberries. And you can smell it ALL. DAY. LONG.</li>
    <li> Been using the shampoo and conditioner for months, and loving it!</li>
    <li> Works aweome! My hairdresser even commented on the new hair growth that I have!</li>
    <li> Love the feel &amp; smell it gives to my hair!!!!</li>
    <li> I have just receive my package i was very happy with it,will definitely order again</li>
    <li> All it claims to do is strengthen your hair so it can grow longer without getting split ends. It doesn’t actually make your hair grow. It says this on the back of the bottles, so don&#x27;t downvote me. After using for about 9 months, I DO think that it does what it claims, but not as well as the products I was using before, which were: the Generic Value Product Clairol purple shampoo and Nexxus Humectress conditioner every fourth day, partnered with the Aphogee Two Minute Keratin Reconstructor (NOT the two step protein treatment!) once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my long hair. I measure my hair every 2 weeks when I color/trim. I record length on my calendar to keep track of what changes the amount of growth, so I figured I would be a good test subject for this product. Before using the NYM, I had an inch and a half of solid growth each month. After, it was CLEARLY growing less an inch a month. I went through testing the NYM twice- first I used the NYM without the Aphogee, went back to my regular products for 2 months, and then used the NYM again with the Aphogee just to make sure that it was actually the NYM and not the lack of Aphogee that was hindering the growth. When I used the Aphogee with the NYM, I had just barely over an inch in growth, so the Aphogee did improve the results. Over this period of time I kept my diet the same, measured before/after trims, didn&#x27;t skip any hair growth vitamins, and stuck to my color regime, which I do religiously every second Saturday. I think the problem is twofold: 1) the shampoo is too strong, drying the hair, and 2) the conditioner doesn&#x27;t sink into the hair as much as the Humectress conditioner I was using before, so when I would brush my hair, the brush didn&#x27;t slide through as easily, which put stress on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also did not like the smell of this. At first smell, it’s like artificial strawberry, but not unpleasant. But when I actually used it in the shower, it was very overwhelming. And even after the hair dries, the smell lingers. It was like a very strong version of Bed Head&#x27;s Rock Star shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I was in a pinch, I might buy it again. Otherwise, no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1 (10/30/15): I replaced the GVP Humectress with the Aussie 3 Minute Moist and have an additional 1/4 inch of growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2 (03/17/16): I now have a solid 2 and a quarter inches of growth per month. I have been using the DevaCurl NoPoo and OneCondition when I wash my hair (every 4th day). This has made my hair much less prone to damage/breaking off. I avoid lathering shampoo like the plague now. For the rare times I do need a lather (usually because I have dye or product buildup), I use the Acure Organics Morroccan Oil Shampoo and Conditioner, which is very gentle. I use a Wet Brush and Wet Brush Shine to brush my hair. I take Natrol Biotin 10,000mcg twice a week.rs. It was like a very strong version of Bed Head&#x27;s Rock Star shampoo.

    <li> My hair has been damaged from constant bleaching and dying for 5 years now, which seemed to stunt my hair growth. Within two weeks, my hair has grown about an inch, which is an absolute record for me! My hair also seems to be healthier than ever.</li>
    <li> great product and easy transaction.</li>
    <li> i have been trying to grow my hair out and i saw this product. i got in  the shower and used it for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;i thought smeled really nice and it felt really good on my hair. but when i got out, i looked at the back of the bottle&lt;br /&gt;and it has all of these really harsh chemicals, types of acid, and so unatural stuff. my friend said the same thing&lt;br /&gt;and she said if this stuff gets in your eyes it will BURN! her eyes were in pain for the next few days.it was a week before i knew these bad chemicals were in the bottle, and i did not see any difference in my hair growth. i will recommend the&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;organix&amp;#34; brand. which is made with natural indredience that is much better for your hair and ill bet your hair will grow much&lt;br /&gt;quicker if u use it. i do not recommend THIS.</li>
    <li> Have only used once so far.  but the chemically made apple smell was nice at first but when i opened it in the shower it was so overpowering. It was kind of slimy i noticed and hard to rub in.&lt;br /&gt;The smell stays in your hair which is a nice light smell.</li>
