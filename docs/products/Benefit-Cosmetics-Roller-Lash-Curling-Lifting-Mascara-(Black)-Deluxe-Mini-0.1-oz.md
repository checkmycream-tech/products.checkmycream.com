    <li> This mascara is seriously the best I have tried.  It is very easy to apply and grabs your lashes and coats them in this wonderful dark coat from root to tip.  I apply 2 coats and my lashes look AMAZING.  Also it seems to hold up well with my watery eyes and doesn&#x27;t form dark spots under them.  I have tried a LOT of other mascaras, some very expensive.  This is a pricey mascara too but you will not want to buy another one after trying it.  It seems to be all in the unique brush and the great formula of the mascara itself that applies the perfect black coat to your lashes without flakes/clumping and makes them look both longer and thicker.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this mascara.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my lashes so I gave it to my daughter who loves it.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly.  Does not cake. For full coverage one has to apply twice. I will purchase when I run out of my sample.</li>
    <li> This mascara is simply amazing! I&#x27;ve tried every kind made and this finally blew me away. Love love love it.</li>

    <li> The best mascara I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I like the way my lashes look with it on, but I notice it will smudge pretty easy throughout the day. I don&#x27;t wear a powder based foundation but rather a creamy foundation, that may be why.</li>
    <li> I have medium length straight lashes. I have a horrible time trying to keep them curled even with multiple uses of a lash curler plus heated lash curler. This does not curl. Great brush but mascara is too wet. Didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> I have super straight eyelashes and it did lift my eyelashes without needing an eyelash curler.  However, when I curled them and applied the mascara my eyelashed dropped and didnt&#x27; retain their curliness like when I use Guerlain mascara. This will do when I don&#x27;t have my eyelash curler around.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. Mostly I love the applicator. I&#x27;ve tried so many different brands and all the applicators make the mascara glob up on my lashes. This has just a slight bend &amp;  it goes on perfectly.</li>
    <li> Finally, a mascara that is not waterproof, stays on and lengthens without clumping.  It&#x27;s a little pricey, but worth it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely no clumping. Makes lashes long and natural, and it lasts all day. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Most amazing mascara I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
    <li> Great mascara.  Really does curl your lashes!! I would also like to say how much I love Amazon😀</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product. It&#x27;s expensive, but it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> love this even more than the they&#x27;re real mascara. It curls on its own as if you used an eyelash curler! Doesn&#x27;t clump or flake.</li>
    <li> I saw a slight difference in size. It would be great if  .  It was waterproof .</li>
    <li> Colors are cute, but it&#x27;s a little drying..</li>
