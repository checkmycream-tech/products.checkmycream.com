<li> It&#x27;s a total natural product that doesn&#x27;t burn my scalp like other tints do.  </li>
<li> I will buy only from Naturtint as long as they contunue to sell on Amazon.</li>
<li> This product is also extremely drying, and even with professional conditioners I get from my stylist, my hair feels dry and brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> it doesn&#x27;t contain ammonia ,but it  still dry my scalp and hair.</li>
<li> For 10 years I spent a lot of money on salon coloring and highlighting.</li>
<li> It does still have PDA in it, but not as much apparently as other colors in the US do.</li>
<li> I save the other developer for another coloring.</li>
<li> have to add that I mixed half 7G and half 8N for a little deeper color</li>
<li> Worse, after the color drops out, I&#x27;m left with orangey-gold, brassy blonde hair.</li>
<li> a little pink saying that this wheat color</li>
<li> i am sensitive to fumes and smells and, after use, i hardly noticed any respiratory reactions like i have had in the past with store chemical brands.</li>
<li> Maybe choose the color you like and then go down one tone.</li>
<li> This product will come out a little darker than the picture and the variation will depend on your haircolor.</li>
<li> The harsh chemicals irritated my scalp and motivated me to try a product with fewer harsh chemicals.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m not sure what to do.</li>
<li> I tried buying from a secondary seller and got stung!  </li>

    <li> I use this haircolor for years and I am very satisfied. And the price in Amazon is unbeatable.</li>
    <li> works great and natural</li>
    <li> Excellent product and price. Thanks!</li>
    <li> A great hair coloring product without the harsh caustic chemicals you find in so many products.  My wife loves Natrutint and has been using it for years.  She particularly likes 8n Wheat Blonde Colorant.  She has also begun using Naturtint Shampoo and Protective Cream which are made to enhance and prolong the effect of the colorant.  Dealing with Naturtint USA via Amazon is a pleasure!  This company goes out of it&#x27;s way to satisfy the customer.  I tried buying from a secondary seller and got stung!  I will buy only from Naturtint as long as they contunue to sell on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Excellent color, no odor easy on the hair. My hair never looked so natural, lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> this is the best product outside of the salon that i&#x27;ve used so far.  In fact my stylist added highlights and a little pink saying that this wheat color&lt;br /&gt;would provide the low lights and it did.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a total natural product that doesn&#x27;t burn my scalp like other tints do.  It does not have that strong ammonia smell.  I get complemented on the color of my hair a lot.  I would recommend this product to anyone who tints their hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best Hair Color product on the market as far as I am concerned.  I have used this product 3 times.  I love the color and it is easy to use.  It does a great job on covering gray.</li>
    <li> I love this hair color.  The price here vs at a store is great.  And time from shopping saved priceless</li>
    <li> Love this color, very natural, I am 50% gray and it does a great job of covering! My hair grows fast so have to do the roots every three weeks, and it doesn&#x27;t sting the way others do. It does still have PDA in it, but not as much apparently as other colors in the US do. I will continue to use it, it feels much gentler and the price is right on Amazon!!! Whole foods sells it for $17. a box</li>
    <li> PROS: I have a problem with regular hair color in that it burns my scalp. This is the only product that does not burn, so I am able to leave the color on for the designated time. The initial color looks beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: However, after about 1-2 weeks, the color is gone. I&#x27;ve discovered that it rubs off. I have a white clip-on hair bow that I use, and the part of the bow that rests against my hair has turn beige. I can&#x27;t wash it off, as the dye color from my hair transferred to the fabric. Worse, after the color drops out, I&#x27;m left with orangey-gold, brassy blonde hair. This product is also extremely drying, and even with professional conditioners I get from my stylist, my hair feels dry and brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a shampoo for color-treated hair and condition religiously, but I get the same result: the color rubs off and my hair feels like straw. I have fine hair that is not quite shoulder-length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried any other colors from this line, but at this price ($17.98/box) where I buy it, I don&#x27;t consider it worthwhile. While it may be a \\&quot;permanent\\&quot; hair color, the actual shade is not permanent.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product, it doesn&#x27;t have ammonia, and it doesn&#x27;t destroy your hair.</li>
    <li> great hair color. i am in my 30s and 75% or more white. this hair color is a medium sandy beige. amount in package is enough for a short hair (to the ears) length hair. good quality ingredients.... when mixed, it looks like clear, tan jelly. it smells like wet cardboard and a mild cat piss order (but that is my opinion).... i am sensitive to fumes and smells and, after use, i hardly noticed any respiratory reactions like i have had in the past with store chemical brands.</li>
    <li> I love the color, it looks natural . I like it doesn&#x27;t contain ammonia ,but it  still dry my scalp and hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and much cheaper here than at the local health store.  This product covers my very gray hair, does not fade and is kind to my long hair.</li>
    <li> Naturtint is a great product. For 10 years I spent a lot of money on salon coloring and highlighting. The harsh chemicals irritated my scalp and motivated me to try a product with fewer harsh chemicals. Naturtint gives me great color with natural highlights and no need for another color process. The Amazon price is unbeatable!</li>
    <li> I love this color! A light brown/dark blond.</li>
    <li> This stuff works and feels great. It covers most of the grey, it feels and looks great.. only wish it lasted longer but you can&#x27;t have it all..</li>
    <li> Have been using this for many years. The colors are true to the photos and it&#x27;s easy to mix and match colors to create your own shade.</li>
    <li> This hair color is so much better than other toxic name brands. Right away, you can smell the difference. Just a tip - you need to leave it on longer to cover gray areas.  I switched to this product a couple of years ago, and I&#x27;ve always been very happy with it.</li>
    <li> The product is great and the cost is less if you buy it direct. I use one every six weeks because it all natural. I received it in 6 days.</li>
    <li> I bought the 6 pack from the seller Naturtint USA. Buying in bulk gives you a reasonable price for a great product.Of course you have to know what color you prefer before doing so.This product will come out a little darker than the picture and the variation will depend on your haircolor. I would say to start lighter as it&#x27;s easier to darken your hair the next time. Maybe choose the color you like and then go down one tone. 8N is a light golden brown. I actually think it is very pretty but I was thinking of mixing it with something to give it a little more depth. It is just easier to use one box and I&#x27;m not sure what to do. So you can mix the colors. The peroxide is in one bottle and then you pour the color in, so if you want to save some for the next application, you would have to use a separate mixing bowl.It doesn&#x27;t fade quickly even though it is a  more natural product, although it eventually will.There is no bad chemical smell,  but I did feel a slight sting at the end of the process. I had no irritation and it doesn&#x27;t stain your skin like the harsher products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to add that I mixed half 7G and half 8N for a little deeper color and I like the results. 8N was just too light for me. I have a separate haircolor bottle with measurements on the outside. Then I pour it in the developer. I save the other developer for another coloring.</li>
