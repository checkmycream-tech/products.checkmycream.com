<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> the body scrub is not really different than others I have used, except the scent is very pleasant to me. It is soft and feminine. The scrub has oil to it so be careful using in the shower it can make your shower floor slippery. My skin feels soft and smooth after using.</li>
    <li> Disappointing product. The salt scrub I tried in the mall Had more oil base so it lubricated as it sloughed dead cells. This is too dry and just falls off because there&#x27;s nothing holding that the salt granules together</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my Dry hands from being here in the Desert.  One day I tried it on my feet and I love how soft they feel after.  It will now be just for my feet, scrubs are great for all dry skin.</li>
    <li> I mix this with my facial cleanser &amp; it helps exfoliate better than other stuff I have used in the past.25-30$ at my mall, this is a great deal on Amazon</li>
    <li> I like this but it came damaged and it was oily all over.. Didn&#x27;t want to waste my time sending it back..</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of dead sea salt products and this everything that I wanted and more.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This product works great! my skin feels clean and soft afterwards. been noticing some scars diminish a bit after a months use. Prolly from all the layers dead skin its been knockin off?</li>
    <li> Wonderful!!! Totally addicted. Smells divine, works great! Hooray for my new favorite scrub...and I can actually afford it. Kudos</li>
    <li> We were introduced to this product at our local mall. We were stopped by a salesman asking if any of us had dry skin. Well, yeah, I mean it&#x27;s winter! :)    I only stopped to see his demonstration because my 10yo son has a problem, every winter, with extremely chapped, cracked and dry skin on the back of his hands, due to washing his hands. I have tried all kinds of lotions, creams and ointments to protect his skin and correct the moisture imbalance. The morning we were given the opportunity to sample the products, I had joked with my son that he was turning into a dragon because the back of his hands felt like lizard skin.    My son used the salt scrub, rinsed and followed up with the cream. His hands were instantly softer! The next morning his hands were remarkably improved and within 2 days they were back to normal. We only need to use the salt scrub once a week and we apply the cream as needed, which is approximately every other morning (or when I can remember to ask him how his hands are doing... he used to come to me daily, due to the pain and discomfort of his dryness!)    I would highly recommend this product. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the Dead Sea salts, the oils or all of the above, but whatever it is it works for us! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Way too oily and not enough salt. The oil and the salt would not stay together so you would just get a hand full of salt that did not stick together and was ultimately ineffective at exfoliating. You end up just feeling oily and smelly. I can see what other people are saying about it smelling expired. I don&#x27;t believe that the product is expired. I believe that it is supposed to smell like something your grandmother used. Regardless, it does smell rank and the rank smell sticks to you. It legitimately smells like death. You can&#x27;t get rid of it with soap. I have incredibly dry skin and I was left with clogged pores, greasiness and zero exfoliation. Not worth the little money I spent on it. I could have bought a better scrub from the drug store for the same price. I wouldn&#x27;t use this product again even if I were paid to do so.</li>
    <li> I was sold this product initially at the mall - I was in the market for a salt scrub (after being fed up with the sub-par job sugar-scrubs do on my winter skin).  The salesperson demonstrated the salt scrub and body moisturizer and I was totally sold!  Purchased both and, after using it for several months now, I am almost out of the scrub (barely even NEED the moisturizer, this stuff is so good!!).  My \\&quot;maturing\\&quot; chest and neck area looks like a 20 year-olds again!  I was noticing some creasing between my breasts (I sleep really scrunched up on my side which doesn&#x27;t help!).  It was pretty obvious, I felt.  GONE!  Just totally gone.  I look smooth, healthy and glowing from my neck and shoulders and chest to my hands, elbows and feet!  I LOVE LOVE this stuff!!!  I am ordering three of these now so that I never run out!  :)  Amazon&#x27;s price is out of this world!</li>
    <li> Vivo Per Lei product is excellent for all.  I Love this mark.</li>
    <li> i bought this at the mall for $80 about a year ago i was introduced to the product. I was so angry becuz, i could of saved so much money. I wanted to buy all the products that come as a set. i think i bought 2 for $150. i got the lotion. Now i order online only. its always better to get it online.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one to write reviews, however, when I received my scrub it was very apparent that my product had gone bad. The scent, Devotion, smelled musty and the color of scrub was slightly gray.  It should be white, I have another tub of the scrub at home to compare it to. I was very disappointed with my order. After reading my fellow reviewers I now realize my  mistake, I originally purchased the scrub from my local mall, and loved it. I was so excited to find it on Amazon for less then half the price, but now I know that it&#x27;s a fake. Next time I&#x27;ll read the reviews more diligently.</li>
    <li> sticky even after many, many rinses.  Best scrub ever is from hsn perlier white almond.  So, on this save your money.</li>
    <li> This made my skin breakout and I will not by any more of these anywhere.. I didnt not like this product</li>
    <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve played with many body care products and never really liked them or enjoyed them. That is, until I found Vivo Per Lei! I&#x27;ve tried time and time again to find a really good exfoliant... something that I felt got the dead skin off my body without being so abrasive I might as well have just used sandpaper. When I stumbled across this I was sold. I didn&#x27;t buy it right away at the mall kiosk but I went back a few months later because it was Christmas time when they showed it to me and I didn&#x27;t have the money at the time to spend on myself and this stuff at mall kiosks tends to be pretty expensive.  Used this when I got home and it&#x27;s been wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, mineral oil does not nourish the skin like other oils can and do, however mineral oil has been used for a long time to soften up and help slough off the dry dead skin in spas and baths throughout the ages, so while this isn&#x27;t going to really moisturize your skin it sure will help all those dead skin cells come off which is what you want.  Follow up with a shea butter based soap or body wash and moisturize afterwards and you&#x27;re good to go.  The salt is supposed to help bring blood flow to the surface of the skin to help give you that glow and healthier skin.  At least is this is what my general research of salt based body scrubs has turned up (and they were just salt scrubs in general, not anything from Vivo Per Lei or any other brand so not much in the way of bias there).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels great, and exfoliating with this before shaving has given me a much smoother and closer shave than I&#x27;ve previously gotten.  My skin also not only feels great but it looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this stuff and use many other Vivo Per Lei products. Already after only two weeks worth of use my skin is looking younger and firmer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Buy it here on Amazon, it&#x27;s MUCH cheaper than buying it from the mall kiosks or from vivopl.com. I love these products enough that I would spend the money but it&#x27;s always nice to save a bundle!money but it&#x27;s always nice to save a bundle!</li>
    <li> The price through Amazon is fantastic.  This scrub leaves my skin feeling good.  The fragrance is awesome.  I would definitely  tell anyone to buy this product.</li>
    <li> A great body moisturizer and its fresh Smeling and not heavy.. I like the entire line as far as products go.</li>
    <li> Wish I could give negative stars. Totally dislike this product.  The perfume they put in it destroys any goodness it may have. The smell is ridiculous, and does not wash off very easily, I had to deal with the headache, my own fault I guess. Why ruin your product with such a strong scent? It seems to me if a person wants to smell a certain way, they will put on a perfume independently, why do our shampoos, conditioners, hair products, lotions, creams, and deodorants all have to be scented and then compete against one another? I don&#x27;t want the product, but I don&#x27;t want to give it to any one I associate with, since I cannot stand the smell,I don&#x27;t want anyone around me smelling this way either. :-(</li>
    <li> Very disappointed would like refund! When it arrived it was all over the box leaking oils everywhere and when I opened it smelled rancid!  I tried the same one in the kiosk at the mall and it smelled so nice and clean and flowery nowhere near like this one!  I CANT EVEN OPEN IT WITHOUT WANTING TO PUKE IT&#x27;S BEEN RANCiD From THE MOMENT I RECIEVED IT. I would like a refund! DISGUSTING!!! I  Do not recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a very expensive and wonderful product. Received this as a Christmas present last year and searched like crazy to find it at an affordable price! Finally found it! I&#x27;m very happy. It arrived in tact, ahead of time and the price was simply outstanding. Will re-order soon!</li>
    <li> the best scrub&lt;br /&gt;always one at home</li>
    <li> Great for your hands during winter when they are drying and cracking. A couple of treatments and the moisture is back.</li>
    <li> A year ago when I paid about 90 dollars from vivo&#x27;s site for the same thing. This stuff is great to soften and gentle enough to use on your face. I have very mixed skin, and nothing has cleared my face like this product has. I love it, you should love it too.</li>
    <li> Looooove this product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Dead skin goes away  and soft smooth no greasy feeling is left&lt;br /&gt;Great to have several to give as gifts</li>
    <li> Heavenly body scrub that that leaves your skin feeling rejuvenated.</li>
    <li> Especially good on feet - keeps them soft and reduces callous buildup.  I definitely plan never to be without it; expensive in the mall but very reasonable on Amazon.</li>
    <li> All of the Vivo products I use are superb. My skin has never looked as youthful and have had comments on it.</li>
    <li> This is a spa-like experience. This body scrub smells great, moisturizes your skin and delivers a deep down clean. I would purchase this again. The only negative is that it makes your bath tub slippery, so for you older folks, be careful. But this happens with almost any body scrub but this one really does moisturize.</li>
    <li> fiancé swears by this stuff, must be good? Always having to reorder.</li>
    <li> Three starts because it seems to work and not five because of being ripped off. I got this product today at the kiosk and I&#x27;m always too tired as I have a disabled child that takes away a lot of my energy. I&#x27;m the kind a person that doesn&#x27;t buy products before researching online because I know you always find them online for cheaper. As I said, I really believe it was me being tired because on top of all I have the effects of a cold just started today. Well, I paid $89.99 for the face peeling mask. I&#x27;m kind of upset at myself because I just saw this  product on Amazon for $70+ less. I say I&#x27;m kind of upset because I think the product actually works. Because of that I don&#x27;t feel so bad. If it helps me on not getting so many breakouts it will be worth it. I&#x27;ll see with time. If I hadn&#x27;t bought it I wouldn&#x27;t even be researching it online because I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the products, the brand etc, (I was out of it) the salesman was showing me so I wouldn&#x27;t have known what to search online for and I would have never bought this product and would&#x27;ve had to continue with the problematic skin on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I tested the product on a couple of non skin surfaces and it just doesn&#x27;t peel.  I tested it on top of a tablet skin protector and the peel just turned greyish watery. the grey must have been the dirt. I also tried the peel on my feet and skin did seemed to come off. Then I tested it on the second surface, the back of a remote control, again no peeling no matter how hard I tried. Went to another part of my foot and peeled again, I think it is dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do hope no one falls for this at the kiosk when you can get it cheaper at Amazon. By the way, the salespeople tried to sell me many other products and offered me free products if I was to buy such and such product but I didn&#x27;t care for them because my main problem is my breakouts. If I could stop my breakouts that&#x27;s all that matters to me. Therefore,  they couldn&#x27;t convince me with anything else. Plus I already knew I was spending $89.99 and that was more than enough. I was a bad girl for spending $90 in hopes of clearning up my acne but the way I see it it&#x27;ll be just unacceptable on my part to buy even more products and spend more money.</li>
    <li> This body scrub removes a lot of crud and leaves my skin looking smooth and moisturized. It also has a hydrating effect. I really do love it.&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived quickly and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I saw this in a mall in Texas,would have bought it ; the price was outrageous.So got on Amazon and bought this and it&#x27;s fantastic! It does work.......Thank you</li>
    <li> The price is great, especially when compared to what they want at the mall. The scrub seems okay. I&#x27;m just not sure it is for me. Now the Vivo Body Butter is a different matter. That I absolutely love!</li>
    <li> I loved this product when I was able to sample it at a mall kiosk. I got the exact product in the mail for a fraction of the cost. The shipping was very prompt and the jars still had all of the safety seals/unopened. I love this stuff. Makes my skin so beautiful. You really can&#x27;t beat this price. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the best skin care product I ever used! Skin get soft and smooth after used once! Love this!</li>
    <li> Bought this item at a mall, which was my first mistake. I&#x27;ve had it all of three months and the product stinks,literally.  It smells bad.  Also leaves your skin feeling greasy,not soft.  Wont waste my hard earned money on it again.</li>
    <li> I find this product is very helpful after using it for several months my skin feel silky and soft I would recommend this product that anyone who have dry skin and problems of there entirely whole go for it you will love it</li>
    <li> Usually when I get scrubs, I quit using them not to long after the purchase as they tend to dry out my skin.  I have had no such problems with this product.  My skin is soft and smooth after using and the smell is pleasant.  This is a scrub I intend to repurchase.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I would recommend to everyone who wants that salon facial at home without the salon cost. Its incredible.</li>
    <li> Really love this product. Good value. My skin literally shines after using it and it feels and smells so good after showering.</li>
    <li> I love the salt scrub, but one out of the two I ordered leaked all over the box they came in, so a lot of the oils were out of the scrub making it dryer and less scented.  That was disappointing</li>
    <li> so, what you need to know is that the first ingredient is SALT, the second is MINERAL OIL, then comes deadsea salt, fragance and parabens..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in other terms, although the product is cheap (if bought around 12$) and can may improve some skin conditions (everything is always possible).. its composition is purely and simply rubish...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#62; u&#x27;d rather buy real dead sea salt, an organic oil of your choice (almond, argan, etc.) and blend your own scrub :p&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote this review because the description says &amp;#34;Enjoy this divine combination of salts from the Dead Sea with luxurious natural oils&amp;#34;.. THIS IS NOT THE CASE ! it is salt, mineral oil (which cannot have any nutritive property of any sort), and eventually an amount of deadsea salt that may be as low as 5%..</li>
    <li> I bought this think it was the orginial but I was overly disapointed. This product is a huge rip off. Dont waste your money!!!</li>
    <li> I love the way it smells and it really does a nice job cleaning the skin-it&#x27;s effective and I&#x27;d buy it again.  I recommend this if you like body scrubs.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Keep it close. Does a good job</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my husband&#x27;s elbows that always seem to be super dry.  Product works great.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I recieved this today. I used it on both my hands and feet.  This product really works.  I feel as if i just had a mani pedi. Incredible!</li>
    <li> It works great, I love to use it on my feet. It leaves them so smooth. Works great on any rough areas.</li>
    <li> This is a good moisturizer and sells for $60.00 a can in the mall!  I needed more for my daughter too.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product and I will buy it again. Don&#x27;t buy it at a mall kiosk. Much cheaper on line.</li>
    <li> Love the product when I purchased it at the mall. It works great and smells heavenly... I saw this at Amazon for an amazing price. I thought it was too good to be true, and it was. I received the scrub, opened it up, and immediately noticed that there was no fragrance. In fact, it turned out to be oily salt crystals. I even tried adding my own lavender oil to avoid a complete loss, but nothing helped. I must say that Amazon was extremely responsive and issued me a credit.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I retail it at my wax shop.</li>
    <li> Excellent, it actually works pretty good, you can see the difference on the skin, my wife and I use it, and it worked form me too.</li>
    <li> I tried it and like it the first few times but then ended up going back to my old products because the match was not good with my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this but I believe it&#x27;s a fake... It says made in Japan. The real stuff does not come from Japan</li>
    <li> I first used this scrub at my sister&#x27;s home. I was so impresses I had her order some for me from Amazon.  It turned sour shortly after receiving it and I had to throw all of the jars away.  I think it was expired or old when I received it. I would not suggest buying it without knowing the expiration date in advance of ordering it.</li>
