      <li>kind).</li>
      <li>kind -- not the &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>After a week it is still going strong, nice!</li>
      <li>The Sonic Fresh electrical toothbrush manages to reproduce perfectly that just-out-of-the-dentist’s-office clean feeling.</li>
      <li>I love the size and portability of it with the nice carrying case.</li>
      <li>It does good job and my teeth feel clean.</li>
      <li>I got so caught up in the features that I guess I should have mentioned that first, lol.</li>
      <li>Just know that for many of us, there may be issues with tolerance.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had electric toothbrushes before (mostly the &amp;#34;spinning&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>/&gt;While I think the Sonicare is a better, product, I am still fairly pleased with the Remington SFT200 Sonicfresh.  </li>
      <li>Love this tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Since he began using this electronic brush, his teeth have been cleaner and his orthodontist has even praised him for better oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the handle feels like it&#x27;s buzzing more in my hand.</li>
      <li>type of cleaning better than the &amp;#34;spinning&amp;#34; type of cleaning.</li>
      <li>, now I love it, cant be with out It.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, a worthwhile alternative.</li>
      <li>I bet it doesn&#x27;t weigh any more than a manual toothbrush either.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d like that.</li>
      <li>method works for me much better then using the whitening strips, and does not leave my teeth sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has just vibration on the brush head so that all of the bristles vibrate vigorously and help with better cleaning.  </li>
      <li>I have had this for about 4 yrs or more, and love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a Sonicare toothbrush ever since my grandmother saw it on Oprah, and I love it.  </li>
      <li>I think the oral B cleans more thoroughly.</li>
      <li>It would be perfect for a younger person, or perhaps someone with arthritic hands, etc.  </li>
      <li>No making sure it&#x27;s seated correctly or anything like that</li>
      <li>LOVE</li>
      <li>but I LOVE that.</li>
      <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I used a Phillips Sonicare toothbrush for years and was pleased with its performance.</li>
      <li>You can pick Clean, Sensitive, and Massage cleaning modes to find the best cleaning cycle you prefer.  </li>
      <li>I love this clean feeling!  </li>
      <li>The sensitive mode decreases some of that intensity to a more pleasant level, and that&#x27;s the one that I use most often.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;So far, this toothbrush has been great.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a good quality case and the brush really does hold charge.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Charging the brush is easy: you literally just stand it up in its cradle and plug it in.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;There are three 3 cleaning modes that can be easily changed just by pushing a button.  </li>
      <li>The integrated 2-minute timer in the SonicFresh also makes it easy to brush for a set period of time.</li>
      <li>It got here, it was easy to unbox, and I immediately charged it up.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s easy to handle.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to turn on, no sliding, just a push button.</li>
      <li>The battery has been going strong for a week already.&lt;br</li>
      <li>this is a good product that feels good in the hand, lasts a long time on a charge and (really what you want most in a toothbrush) cleans my teeth</li>
      <li>This is a huge plus because you don&#x27;t have to leave it</li>
      <li>It is great on the gums, actually.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re someone who needs to pay extra attention to your gums,  this is a great toothbrush for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It uses a round, dental hygienist-style brush head, and it does an excellent job.</li>
      <li>The handle is comfortable to hold, and it doesn&#x27;t take up a huge amount of counter space.</li>
      <li>(it comes with two, but additional heads are available).</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re supposed to let it move lightly over the surface of the teeth.</li>
      <li>I received this product free of charge, in exchange for my review.</li>
      <li>It gets the job done and does it comfortably and efficiently.</li>
      <li>I would recommend it as a travel brush, as a supplement, or as your primary.</li>
      <li>First of all the Remington is sleeker and fits more easily in my hand.</li>
      <li>Kinda reminded me of some tool the dentist would use to clean your teeth from the whirling sound it makes.</li>
      <li>The Remington SFT200 Sonicfresh Rechargeable Toothbrush is not my first electric toothbrush, but has become a favorite.</li>
      <li>gave a review on this when I first got this from amazon, and truthfully didn&#x27;t care for it</li>
      <li>It charges up in 16hrs - lasts for about 2 weeks, and when used it leaves your teeth feeling CLEAN.  </li>
      <li>I feel my breath being fresher and teeth squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>My mouth feels so clean afterward even on the lower</li>
      <li>My teeth felt clean after use, but I prefer my rounded oral B electric toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I have been using the sensitive and it has been leaving my teeth nice and clean.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a nice little unit, that will be enjoyed by many.  </li>
      <li>It was a good suggestion, as we all feel our teeth are cleaner than ever, especially my daughter, who had been having difficulty cleaning beneath the wires.  </li>
      <li>so I think even with future replacement costs added in there&#x27;s still good value here.  </li>
      <li>I would still recommend the Sonicare over this product, but if you opt to buy this toothbrush, it is not a bad product.</li>
      <li>I will say, post use, your mouth will feel ultimately fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>middling three star rating reflects only my own inability to comfortably use this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The Sonic Fresh electrical toothbrush manages to reproduce perfectly that just-out-of-the-dentist’s-office clean feeling. I also love that its base is rechargeable; no more running out of battery mid-brush! The toothbrush times your brushing, breaking it into four thirty-second intervals.  It can be irritating to skew the toothbrush’s timekeeping because you have to stop and spit, but unless you insist upon brushing your teeth for two minutes on the dot, it’s only a small nuisance.  I’ve never used an electric toothbrush for more than a few weeks before abandoning it, but this one’s a keeper!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been hesitant to jump on the sonic toothbrush bandwagon. They&#x27;re just big, unwieldy, and pricy. The size where this brush stood out to me. Not only is the handle fairly small, the base also has an incredibly small footprint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, this toothbrush has been great. It has three speeds, normal, sensitive, and message. I&#x27;ve been using sensitive to get acostomed the high power. My mouth feels so clean afterward even on the lower setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m the only one using this, though it does have an extra head, and the battery life seems to about live up to the advertised 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush..  It charges up in 16hrs - lasts for about 2 weeks, and when used it leaves your teeth feeling CLEAN.  The extra settings to choose from Clean, Sensitive, and Massage cleaning modes is an extra special feature of this toothbrush.  It has the 2 minute setting to ensure that after 30 seconds you switch quadrants as per the established normal brushing time.  It comes with an extra head and the charger which doubles as a stand for the toothbrush.  It has a lightweight design.  I have used oral b in the past and this definitely is comparable.  For the price, I do not see how you can go wrong on this one.  5 stars.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is so light and small that it feels like a regular toothbrush. I have another electric toothbrush that is much bulkier. I like this one much better because it takes up a lot less space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to my other one, it also vibrates as opposed to a brushing action. I, personally, prefer the brushing action. It has three speeds: regular, sensitive and massage. The sensitive speed is handy for people like me who have sensitive teeth, and the massage setting can be used to clean your tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It charges up nicely, and lights up red when it is still charging. The battery has been going strong for a week already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with a case, two heads and colored bands to help you identify which head is yours.</li>
    <li> I have been using this toothbrush for a few weeks now, and I absolutely LOVE it. My teeth feel like I just came from the dentist, and I have gotten over my dislike of electric toothbrushes! I have used my husbands in the past (with the extra brush head) and it always felt funny. This Remington gives you the benefits of the massaging brush without that funny tickling feeling of a brush that vibrates too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It runs for 2 minutes with pauses at every 30 seconds so you can alternate top and bottom. I found I had to change my grip on the brush handle itself because I was changing it to sensitive or massage in the middle of brushing. I also used it without the charging stand for 5 days when I went on vacation and it was absolutely brilliant. It never lost its charge, and the case for traveling has little vents by the brush head so it can dry properly. It did take a while to charge when I returned home, but it never lost its charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one tiny complaint is that the cover on top of the charging station does collect moisture from the brush that drips down, regardless of how well you try to dry the brush. I leave the cover off occasionally to dry it out- that moisture trapped in there can&#x27;t be good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that is only one small complaint. Otherwise, I love this toothbrush!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had electric toothbrushes before (mostly the &amp;#34;spinning&amp;#34; kind -- not the &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; kind). Although my husband still uses his, I stopped and &amp;#34;went manual&amp;#34; a few years back. When this came up for review via the Vine program, I thought I&#x27;d try it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am actually quite a big fan of this toothbrush for several reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. You can charge it and then it stays charged for quite a long time. I&#x27;m on my second week after the initial charge and still going. This is a huge plus because you don&#x27;t have to leave it plugged in all the time like my husband&#x27;s Braun Oral-B toothbrush (which hogs up one of the two outlets in our bathroom). I also like that you can charge the toothbrush and take it on a vacation. It comes with a very nice travel case. I used it this weekend for a 3-day getaway and it worked wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The other thing I like about this toothbrush is that isn&#x27;t big and bulky like my husband&#x27;s. It is about the same size as a regular toothbrush. And, because I don&#x27;t have to keep it charged all the time, it doesn&#x27;t take up all this room on the bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I like that there are three settings -- Clean, Sensitive, and Massage. I really only need &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; but I think it is great that there is a sensitive setting. If I convince my husband to try this toothbrush, this would be a good setting for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I like the &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; type of cleaning better than the &amp;#34;spinning&amp;#34; type of cleaning. It is less messy (not as much drool and mess generated) and it feels good  -- kind of tickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t see any downside to this toothbrush. It is portable, slim, lightweight, rechargeable and doesn&#x27;t need to always be plugged in. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> I have always wanted to try an electric toothbrush, and this one seemed to fill the bill. It got here, it was easy to unbox, and I immediately charged it up. The package contained the charger, a washable cover for it, the handle, three different color bands, two brushes and a vented travel case. The handle is nice and slim giving it the feel of a regular toothbrush. It has three settings, regular, sensitive, and massage, I chose sensitive because my teeth are. It is easy to turn on, no sliding, just a push button. I am ready to go! I loved it, it is so easy to use, all I do is slowly work my way across my teeth, how simple is that? After a week it is still going strong, nice!</li>
    <li> I own another rechargeable toothbrush. It uses a round, dental hygienist-style brush head, and it does an excellent job. Even after all the years of using it though, I still want to &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; my teeth with it, and you&#x27;re not supposed to do that. You&#x27;re supposed to let it move lightly over the surface of the teeth. One of the things I love about the Remington SFT200 is that I can actually brush my teeth with it. The brush head doesn&#x27;t actually move - it pulses. It really does combine the best of both worlds. You get to busy your hands with old-fashioned manual brush movements (which for me is like scratching an itch, it feels good and natural.) And you also get the deep, truly clean feeling that only an electric toothbrush can provide. Also, the Remington is incredibly light weight and holds a charge for a very long time. I would recommend it as a travel brush, as a supplement, or as your primary. It fills all those roles.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting a good quality rechargeable tooth brush for a long time now- and I finally got one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I adore this brush. The heads are on the smaller side- I noticed this is a complaint to some other customers but I LOVE that. I have a small mouth (my dentist said so) and because of it it makes reaching the back of my rear molars hard to do with a standard sized tooth brush.  The compact size of these tooth brush heads is perfect for my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base is very compact for the smallest of bathrooms and takes up only a very small amount of counter space. LOVE THAT since I have a tiny bathroom. I don&#x27;t tend to leave my base plugged in all the time- I keep  my brush in the travel case when I am using it unless I have it charging it. The charging base is easy to use- you just stick the brush in the designated area and viola. No making sure it&#x27;s seated correctly or anything like that is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of the travel case- it&#x27;s a good quality case and the brush really does hold charge. I used it on my recent vacation and while I brought a manual one in case it ran out of battery I never needed the standard brush.  The travel case snaps shut and has airvents near the head to prevent mold build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit that I initially found the fact that it shuts off and back on every thirty seconds to remind you to move to the next section of your mouth a little odd- because I tend to brush my mouth as a whole not in sections but I have gotten use to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I can see being an issue is that the replacement heads do not come in a soft option. I would like that but I can live with the medium.</li>
    <li> This electric toothbrush had a thin and sleek design. It comes with two replaceable heads with various colorful bands to allow for personalization. The brush&#x27;s vibration is too powerful. Even on sensitive mode, it was a bit strong. The head is ovoid. It pauses every 30 seconds to notify you to move to next quadrant. Ensuring that you brush for the recommended two minutes. My teeth felt clean after use, but I prefer my rounded oral B electric toothbrush. I think the oral B cleans more thoroughly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Sonicare toothbrush ever since my grandmother saw it on Oprah, and I love it.  I&#x27;ve had to buy a few different ones when the battery died, and I&#x27;ve always been happy.  Obviously, I can&#x27;t help but compare this model to that one.  While Grandma bought me the version with all the bells and whistles, I&#x27;ve since downgraded to one that cleans, and does nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like my older Sonicare models, this one pauses when it&#x27;s time to switch sections.  It&#x27;s a nice feature, but one that I don&#x27;t think is make-or-break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feature I did like was the multiple settings for sensitive versus regular cleaning.  This toothbrush is probably a little harsher than my Sonicare, so I&#x27;d probably be considered &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34;.  There is also a massage setting, but I can&#x27;t really figure out why I&#x27;d want that.  I guess it&#x27;s nice to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a long time to charge this toothbrush up, but that&#x27;s for taking it on trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a worthwhile alternative.</li>
    <li> This is my first and will be the last non-manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Although conveniently battery-powered, it&#x27;s simply too much for my old teeth to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A middling three star rating reflects only my own inability to comfortably use this product.</li>
    <li> This rechargeable toothbrush isn&#x27;t big or clunky, and it brushes the dickens out of my teeth, and especially my pop-on dentures. Hand brushing never seems to quite do the job, and neither does soaking, so fewer teeth actually means more brushing, and an electric toothbrush really helps.</li>
    <li> I have been a Sonicare user for many years and have been very happy with that product.  However, I wanted to try a different high end electric toothbrush to see how the products to compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial impressions of the Remington SFT200 Sonicfresh were favorable.  The toothbrush has 3 modes, regular, sensative, and massage modes.  The sensitive mode could be beneficial to people just starting using a product like this as the initial transition can be slightly painful when coming from a manual brush, at least that was the experience I had with Sonicare.  The brush pauses slightly every 30 seconds so you know when you should move from one quadrant of your mouth to the next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size of the Remington SFT200 Sonicfresh is one of the major pluses for this product.  The brush is roughly as big around as a Sharpie marker.  The length seems to be about the same as a regular brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging base is thinner than the Sonicare, but still takes up about the same footprint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the major negative for this product is that I just don&#x27;t think it did as good of a job cleaning as the Sonicare.  I think it did a pretty good job overall, but when I as using the Remington SFT200 Sonicfresh, my teeth seemed to feel gritty and sticky much faster than when I was using my Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I think the Sonicare is a better, product, I am still fairly pleased with the Remington SFT200 Sonicfresh.  Personally, due to its more compact size, this is now my travel toothbrush.  I would still recommend the Sonicare over this product, but if you opt to buy this toothbrush, it is not a bad product.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a lot to like about this toothbrush.  It&#x27;s relatively smaller and lighter weight than competitive products so it&#x27;s easy to handle.  The brush head is a bit smaller too. Some have commented that the size of the toothbrush makes it harder to hold onto but for me that&#x27;s not an issue and I find that the smaller brush head makes it easier to reach and clean my back teeth.  if you have a smaller mouth you&#x27;ll know what I mean.  It takes a while for the initial charge but that enables about 2 weeks of brushing twice a day.  The smaller size and long charge make this a great product to pack away for a trip and, bonus, it comes with it&#x27;s own travel case too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is a bit stiffer than I&#x27;d like but there are three settings and I find that the sensitive setting offsets this concern.  There&#x27;s a unique two minute timer that alerts the user every 30 sec. to switch mouth quadrants. At the end of the fourth quadrant (2 min.) the brush turns off.  At first I didn&#x27;t like this feature but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it and actually it&#x27;s quite convenient.  Give it time and I think you&#x27;ll find it useful too.  And of course you can turn the brush off before then or immediately turn it on again if not done using it yet.  Included is a second brush head (for someone else or as your first replacement brush) and if sharing there are colored rings that let you know which brush is yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note: I believe the replacement brushes only come in medium and I would like to see a soft brush option as well.  But the price ($14.99 for two brush heads on Amazon) is reasonable to me so I think even with future replacement costs added in there&#x27;s still good value here.  All-in-all this is a good product that feels good in the hand, lasts a long time on a charge and (really what you want most in a toothbrush) cleans my teeth well. I got so caught up in the features that I guess I should have mentioned that first, lol.</li>
    <li> I used a Phillips Sonicare toothbrush for years and was pleased with its performance. There are several features of the Remington Sonicfresh that I like better. First of all the Remington is sleeker and fits more easily in my hand. It does good job and my teeth feel clean. My son has used the extra toothbrush head. He&#x27;s fourteen years old and has braces. Since he began using this electronic brush, his teeth have been cleaner and his orthodontist has even praised him for better oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds a charge for at least a week while I&#x27;ve been traveling and the included traveling case is compact and convenient. The charging station is small and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space on the counter.</li>
    <li> I guess this is Remington&#x27;s alternative to the Sonicare.  I&#x27;ve been using the Sonicare for years and the biggest differences I see are the handle is a tad thinner than the newer Sonicare models but the handle feels like it&#x27;s buzzing more in my hand. Maybe the wand has less weight?  This does not seem to impact the quality of the teeth cleaning. That part seems about the same.  Shifting modes (Clean, Sensitive, Massage) is a bit more intuitive though.  Overall if this brush is a few bucks cheaper then it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
    <li> Never knew I was always doing it wrong and you were supposed to brush for at least two minutes. I guess that&#x27;s why I always have cavities when I visit the dentist!&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about this brush is how loud and powerful it is compared to anything I ever used before. Kinda reminded me of some tool the dentist would use to clean your teeth from the whirling sound it makes. It will pause for a second ever 30 seconds for you to switch the teeth you are brushing. According to the instructions you are supposed to spend 30 seconds on the outside and 30 seconds on the inside of your teeth top and bottom for a total of 2 minutes. It has 3 modes: the normal clean, sensitive and massage. When I first started using it I had to use sensitive which seems to slow it down because the normal clean felt too strong and was too intense for me. It definitely cleans and my teeth have never felt cleaner except after getting a professional teeth cleaning at the dentist! The only concern I have is that it may be too harsh or hard on the teeth and be wearing down the enamel. Have no clue how you determine that though. Oh and one last nice touch that really stood out is the different colored rubber bands you can put on the brush so you can tell them apart if multiple people are using it.</li>
    <li> I love this clean feeling!  My first toothbrush that wasn&#x27;t hand powered, and I&#x27;m very impressed.  Trying the lowest settings right now but hopefully I can take the more intense ones later after I become used to this.  I used to be really good at brushing daily but somehow fell out of the habit as I got older and more busy.  This sonic system is new and interesting so I&#x27;m not forgetting to brush.  I feel my breath being fresher and teeth squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> The Remington Sonicfresh pumps out 31,000 pulses per minute, but is the size and handling of a manual brush. Its&#x27; also rechargeable and dentist recommended.  You can pick Clean, Sensitive, and Massage cleaning modes to find the best cleaning cycle you prefer.  The integrated 2-minute timer in the SonicFresh also makes it easy to brush for a set period of time.</li>
    <li> This electric toothbrush really is very lightweight and handles like a manual toothbrush. I bet it doesn&#x27;t weigh any more than a manual toothbrush either. It&#x27;s like there&#x27;s no weight or bulk to it at all. I have used several different Sonicare toothbrushes over the years, as well as Oral B electric and the complaint that I always had with them was that they&#x27;re bulky. This Remington has no bulk at all. It is a slim, sleek body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other electric toothbrushes typically have moving parts in the brush heads and there is a lot of movement in the brush head. With this Remington,  there are no moving parts. I wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d like that. It has just vibration on the brush head so that all of the bristles vibrate vigorously and help with better cleaning.  It is great on the gums, actually. I always thought my Oral B got my gums really good, but I like this vibrating alternative a bit better. If you&#x27;re someone who needs to pay extra attention to your gums,  this is a great toothbrush for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 3 settings and while I mostly just use the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; setting,  they are all good. The sensitive setting is good for people with sensitive teeth or gums and the massage setting is great for gum care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a handy travel/storage case that is pretty much the same size as a regular manual toothbrush travel case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging station is about the same size as other electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve owned and this one can go a week or two on a single full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like it, even compared to my current toothbrush which cost over 100 dollars more.  This Remington is a great value. It performs well with great results and has a nice slim, easy to handle body.</li>
    <li> The Remington SFT200 Sonicfresh Rechargeable Toothbrush is not my first electric toothbrush, but has become a favorite. The brush head itself is a nice size, it&#x27;s not bulky or too big so I can get my back molars comfortably and the sides of my mouth as well.&lt;br /&gt;It has three cleaning settings, clean, sensitive and massage. I have been using the sensitive and it has been leaving my teeth nice and clean. The two minute timer is also a nice touch. I like that it comes with a second head, so I gave that one to my husband.&lt;br /&gt;You can charge this toothbrush, an hour charge lasts two days, sixteen hour charge lasts for a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a really nice, quality rechargeable toothbrush! I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> Battery lasts forever, which is great for travel-you don&#x27;t need to bring the charger with you. The slim design makes it feel like a basic toothbrush, but you can certainly notice the difference with the 3 cleaning modes.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a &#x27;sonic&#x27; toothbrush, since spending a lot of money on one of the top brands a number of years ago (purchased from my dentist), with nothing but disappointment.  It would hardly hold a charge through the four quadrants of my mouth before putting along.  That&#x27;s not the case with this model. It runs like a boat motor.  That should be good, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for me, I have sensitive teeth with some receeding gums from overbrushing with a firm toothbrush, throwing on some powdered baking soda and abrasives when younger -- for whiter teeth before bleaching became popular.  Over the years, I&#x27;ve gone to soft brushes and Sensodyne to control symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I have several teeth that are screaming today, after a few brushings with this system.  I suspect this may be partly because the brush is &#x27;medium&#x27; but feels hard, to me.  It literally bounces of my teeth, even when selecting &#x27;sensitive&#x27; mode.  I&#x27;m not sure why this is necessary, when softer bristles are recommended by ALL dentists now to protect the gums.  Softer bristles with sonic pulses should cover all bases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like that the unit is very lightweight, and easy to handle.  It would be perfect for a younger person, or perhaps someone with arthritic hands, etc.  It also has a nice case for the brush for travel and claims to hold charge for up to two weeks.  So, for short trips, we should be able to avoid toting the charger.  I haven&#x27;t tested to see if it actually would stay charged for two weeks, but as powerful as it is now, I think I could scrub my whole house with it, before it would give up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a nice little unit, that will be enjoyed by many.  Just know that for many of us, there may be issues with tolerance.  It does say in the instructions that time is needed to adjust.  I&#x27;m not sure time will change my opinion, when my teeth are so uncomfortable, at the moment. I will say, post use, your mouth will feel ultimately fresh and clean.  Definitely more so than after using the standard toothbrush.finitely more so than after using the standard toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Nice tooth brush for the price. I prefer electric toothbrushes so this is a nice lower end brush.</li>
    <li> Our dentist recommended we use an electric toothbrush for improved cleaning. This was especially true for one of my kids, who wears braces. It was a good suggestion, as we all feel our teeth are cleaner than ever, especially my daughter, who had been having difficulty cleaning beneath the wires.  The multiple heads and color bands make it easy for us to share the toothbrush (it comes with two, but additional heads are available). The handle is comfortable to hold, and it doesn&#x27;t take up a huge amount of counter space. I appreciate the travel case, but we haven&#x27;t had occasion to use it yet, as we have been keeping the toothbrush on its base on our bathroom counter. The only disadvantages that I&#x27;ve found are that the brush is a bit strong at its basic speed, and although sharing the brush is great, traveling can be problematic unless we&#x27;re traveling together. I will be keeping regular toothbrushes handy for sleepovers.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush. It works pretty much like other electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve owned, but there are some things that make this one my favorite. I love the size and portability of it with the nice carrying case. Also, the 3 cleaning modes make a difference for me and allow for some extra gum massage. It gets the job done and does it comfortably and efficiently. I received this product free of charge, in exchange for my review.</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with this brush.  My son&#x27;s dentist recommended he use a sonic brush, and the timer is an added bonus for him to make sure he spends enough time on each side.  He liked it so much I ordered a second for myself.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it has different settings.  The vibration was too strong on the &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34; setting for my son, so we switched his to &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; and he says that works great.  I like the cleaning setting on mine.  It does take quite a while to charge the first time you plug it in, but after it&#x27;s charged it lasts nearly two weeks with twice daily brushing. It&#x27;s nice that it doesn&#x27;t have to be plugged in all the time, especially on vacation.  The brush itself is about the same size as a &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; toothbrush and fits nicely in my carry-on.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a comfortable, handy sonic brush, especially with the different settings and timer.</li>
    <li> I have had this for about 4 yrs or more, and love it. Still works perfect.&lt;br /&gt;It does Not vibrate ( cant think of another word?)  against your teeth, it feels good.&lt;br /&gt;I just do not think it gets in-between my teeth!! So I brush  first, then put on&lt;br /&gt;Kiss my face triple action toothpaste (amazon)  use this  Remington sonic, and my Dentist and hygienist thought i went and had my teeth whitened. Honest.&lt;br /&gt;I use this about every one to two weeks, not everyday.&lt;br /&gt;This method works for me much better then using the whitening strips, and does not leave my teeth sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a coffee drinker, but I&#x27;m a herbal tea drinker, and I&#x27;m a older women.I also have my teeth cleaned every 6 to 8 months, but&lt;br /&gt;My teeth only look White from using it this way for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave a review on this when I first got this from amazon, and truthfully didn&#x27;t care for it, now I love it, cant be with out It.</li>
    <li> The Remington Sonicfresh toothbrush is very slim and easily held.  With up to 31,000 sonic pulses per minute, teeth and gums feel extra clean.  Mine came with only one brush head and a travel case.  The charging base is also small and takes up minimum space.  The supposedly 30-second timer between intervals is sometimes only 25 seconds. The charge does last approximately two weeks.  I use the first cleaning mode only, although there are three.  The buttons are slightly difficult to press when in the middle of brushing, as they are flat and smoothly lying on the toothbrush.  This brush has a quick-charge function of one hour that can be used when you are in a hurry to get it charged.  Compared to my other brand of sonic toothbrush, this one is much easier to use and I get the same or better results.  I will use the Remington instead, as it takes up less space and cleans well.</li>
    <li> Last a long time without charging. My bathroom lacks an electrical outlet so that is a nice perk. Does an excellent job and has three settings. Love this tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist recomended I get an electric toothbrush to help my receeding gums. This is good feeling and helps my dental health. Yay!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll begin this review by getting into the technical aspects of the product and my experience with the charging, usage, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging the brush is easy: you literally just stand it up in its cradle and plug it in.  Once the light encircling the top of the base turns from red to blue, it&#x27;s done.  The instructions state that before its first use, it should be charged for 16 hours. (That&#x27;s also how long it takes to fully charge it each subsequent time, though a quick charge of 1 hour yields about four 2 minute brushing sessions.)  I wound up having to unplug mine after 4 hours (not because of the toothbrush, but because I had to unexpectedly leave my house).  When I tried to resume charging it the next day, the light was blue and stayed that way, so I thought I&#x27;d go ahead and begin using the toothbrush, thinking that the charge would likely only last for a short while.  By the time the light began blinking from blue to red (which indicates it needs to be charged), it had lasted through almost 50 two minute sessions, much to my surprise.  So it really holds its charge for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is slim and not at all bulky, and the brush head is on the smaller side, so I wondered if I would really feel like it had cleaned a lot of surface area before the brush indicated either that the section was done or that the entire 2 minute session was.  (The instructions indicate that it&#x27;s helpful to brush your teeth in quadrants, allowing 30 seconds per section, with the brush pausing in its vibrations at each 30 second mark, and then shutting off entirely after 2 minutes.)  As for results, the brush head may be relatively small, but I do feel like it really cleans my teeth, and I can also say that it looks like it&#x27;s removed some surface stains, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three 3 cleaning modes that can be easily changed just by pushing a button.  The clean mode can be a little intense.  My teeth and gums are fairly sensitive, so this mode with its really strong vibrations isn&#x27;t something that I can use all the time, but when I do, it gets the job done very well.  The sensitive mode decreases some of that intensity to a more pleasant level, and that&#x27;s the one that I use most often.  The massage mode is very gentle, and is supposed to be used on the gums, which is something I haven&#x27;t done, as of yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other things of note: this unit does come with a replacement brush head, so all told, this is supposed to be enough to get one through for a full six months.  It also comes with a slim travel case, and little colored bands that can be used to differentiate between brush heads if the base is being used by multiple people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my overall take on this, I&#x27;ve been very pleased.  I&#x27;d looked at a rival company&#x27;s product that was *insanely* expensive, and I simply couldn&#x27;t justify spending that much on a toothbrush.  This one is a fraction of that price, and in my experience (and from what I&#x27;ve read of the more expensive one) this one does pretty much all the same things and works just as well.  It really cleans the teeth; the timer function comes in very handy so that you know exactly how long to spend on each quadrant; and it holds a charge for a very long time.  It&#x27;s a good quality, effective product, and I think prospective buyers will be pleased with it.</li>
