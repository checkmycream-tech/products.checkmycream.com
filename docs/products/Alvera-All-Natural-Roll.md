### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>but this one is just perfect.</li>
      <li>Smells great!</li>
      <li>I also regret telling all of my friends to purchase this product because I thought it was the best \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorant out</li>
      <li>as all men know, if she is happy.....I am happy.</li>
      <li>Works great and no aluminum-</li>
      <li>Great to use instead of those you buy in grocery stores.</li>
      <li>I lead a nature hike on the weekends and this product works great without needing to reapply after the hike!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great alternative to the chemical deodorants.</li>
      <li>I purchased this deodorant almost a year ago in a health food store and found it to be the best and most effective \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorant I have ever used.</li>
      <li>(it smells good).</li>
      <li>I was so glad to see it on sale online!</li>
      <li>but so glad that this product works for me!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>grocery store stopped carrying them, so I was made happy again when I found them available through Amazon.</li>
      <li>so he are happy it is still available from Amazon.</li>
      <li>I make my own deodorants now.</li>
      <li>This is a nice product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, and haven&#x27;t liked</li>
      <li>aloe herbal by far the best deoderant of all time!!!</li>
      <li>bottle advertises: SAFE AND EFFECTIVE, ALL-NATURAL, \\&quot;Our Unique lotion formula conditions your skin as it works to provide a safe and non-irritating, yet effective alternative to chemical deodorants.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>That was many, many years ago</li>
      <li>It lasts most of the day.</li>
      <li>The almond reminds me of a danish:)</li>
      <li>This fragrance lasts all day and is safe to use - no antiperspirant.</li>
      <li>The scent is okay and diminished thru the day.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It comes in an unscented version, which works just as well, and personally I love the smell of the aloe herbal one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this deodorant.</li>
      <li>I found much better alternatives to this product at bubbleandbeecom and etsycom/bathlife .</li>
      <li>Great for sensitive skin!!</li>
      <li>Best deodorant I&#x27;ve used in a long time.</li>
      <li>I was so happy when I discovered Alveras roll-on herbal deodorant in my grocery store (New Seasons).  </li>
      <li>There are better prices available than through Amazon, shop around</li>
      <li>Always a favorite of mine the light scent and easy application of Alvera roll ons is desirable in any deodorant product.  </li>
      <li>It is all natural, smells very mild and good</li>
      <li>scent is mild, and while it&#x27;s nothing to get really excited about, I&#x27;d rather have a working deodorant that I know is ethical, than a really good smelling deodorant that has animal ingredients or tests on animals.</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t prevent you from sweating because it&#x27;s aluminum free, but you don&#x27;t get stinky when you sweat.</li>
      <li>Smells so good and is all natural</li>
      <li>Enter this deodorant; it does it all, naturally, and I&#x27;m very pleased with how it works.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve used this roll-on product for many years and find it is not only effective but also non-irritating.  </li>
      <li>No aluminum in it, and it lasts, e.g., no body odor after full day of activity.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if Aluminum in a deodorant is a true risk, or at what concentration it risks being a hazard, but in any case, the Alcloxa in this product is also known as ALUMINUM CHLORHYDROXY ALLANTOINATE, according to the EWG cosmetic database, http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/700214/ALCLOXA/&lt;br /&gt;The (arguably over-cautious)</li>
      <li>and I have loved and constantly used it since then.</li>
      <li>However, that smell quickly disappears and leaves you with neutral smelling underarms.</li>
      <li>I work out daily (about an hour of intense sweating) and even then it&#x27;s held up great.</li>
      <li>It feels cool on the skin and smells fresh.</li>
      <li>Naturally Fresh but</li>
      <li>Ok, I decided to try and use a natural deodorant that didn&#x27;t have any antipersperants or aluminum in it.</li>
      <li>My daughter recommended this product, and she was right.  </li>
      <li>It worked well for me for about a month, then stopped working in my right</li>
      <li>Nothing will help much when you are working out or in the heat for hours though!</li>
      <li>On its ingredient list is the antimicrobial astringent called Alcloxa, which contains Aluminum and is chemically related to the Aluminum Chlorohydrate that many people try to avoid in deodorants.  </li>
      <li>definitely like this one better.</li>
      <li>I may need to reapply when it gets really hot out as I do sweat a lot.</li>
      <li>I smell good everyday for years.</li>
      <li>It left my underarms bright lobster red and VERY itchy.</li>
      <li>If you tend not to smell much / at all, I&#x27;d probably recommend the Kiss</li>
      <li>This is the only thing that keeps me feeling comfortable.</li>
      <li>I really like this deodorant.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used both the almond and herbal, but much prefer the herbal.</li>
      <li>i alternate different brands on different days because in the first years when i started experimenting with natural deodorants, i learned that a good one can eventually &amp;#34;stop&amp;#34; working.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you are not allergic to aloe vera or any of the other ingredients!</li>
      <li>You want to be careful about what kinds of strong chemicals you put in that area of glands right around major hubs of your lymphatic system, but you want a product that works well, too.  </li>
      <li>I started using this after a doctor told me to switch to a natural product when I was in high school, and this was one of the first products I tried.</li>
      <li>This product cleverly hides the fact that it contains aluminum hydroxide by cloaking it under the tradename of \\&quot;Alcloxa,\\&quot; which is a combination of allantion and aluminum hydroxide.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other natural deodorants when Alvera has been sold out and haven&#x27;t found one that works better than this one.</li>
      <li>None of them lasted for more than a few hours before I had to reapply.&lt;br</li>
      <li>even so, most of the natural ones fall down on the job.</li>
      <li>ONLY I USE RIGHT NOW.</li>
      <li>This is very effective for me, and I&#x27;d like to give it a high rating, but it&#x27;s true that, as other reviewers have noted, this deodorant deceptively advertises itself as &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; and as an &amp;#34;alternative to chemical deodorants&amp;#34; (a generally absurd claim, but that&#x27;s another story).  </li>
      <li>My friend who normally uses traditional antiperspirant started using this from time  when wearing certain outfits because it doesn&#x27;t stain her clothing.</li>
      <li>They all wore off quickly and left me smelling less than fresh.</li>
      <li>I like it, but it does not hold as well as an over the counter regular deoderant, but it does hold for a certain period of time.</li>
      <li>and because I thought it was all natural.</li>
      <li>I will keep using it because it is a natural product.</li>
      <li>i was surprised</li>
      <li>This is the only cruelty-free deodorant I&#x27;ve tried that actually keeps me fresh and non-stinky, even after use for over a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Ok, so I&#x27;ve used just about every drugstore deodorant out there from Secret Clinical to Dove, Degree, and even the Thai Crystal Rock Deodorants-they all left my clothes smelling like sweat covered up by a fake fragerance and didn&#x27;t help me smell very nice.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t a complete masking of scent, and you do have to get used to sweating if you&#x27;ve work anti-perspirant for years (you do get used to it), but it is gentle on my skin and gives me extra protection on regular days.  </li>
      <li>Used to have to get it at a specific store in New York, then I moved away.</li>
      <li>i have at least 9 different brands because of so many trial and errors.</li>
      <li>I have been using all natural deodorants for the last 10 years because I have a lot of cancer and Alzheimers in my family</li>
      <li>apparently this has aluminum in it.</li>
      <li>a big sweater:( goes on and feels wet for a bit but is natural and way better for you:)</li>
      <li>After discovering the potential dangers of aluminum I tried various natural deodorants unsuccessfully.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve searched all over --- tried the most expensive natural products and this is the only one that works.  </li>
      <li>When I&#x27;m in hot climates, I reapply it a few times during the day just to freshen up.</li>

<li> I can&#x27;t say the same about other all naturals.</li>
<li> always look for keywords in deodorant like \\&quot;anti-perspirant\\&quot; and aluminum; instead this bottle just says \\&quot;designed to keep you dry and odor</li>
<li> Aside from the alcloxa, for me this product worked for about 4-8 hours, does not irritate, &amp; takes time to dry.</li>
<li> They were also generally hard to soap off right away since they were so &amp;#34;caky.&amp;#34; I ended up having to let my armpits rest for a few days without chemicals, or apply aloe gel to help with the irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It is becoming almost impossible to locate in our local stores</li>
<li> not many natural deodorants work for me, but this one does.</li>
<li> This stuff didn&#x27;t keep me dry, it kept my underarms wet!  </li>
<li> MINUS 5.&lt;br</li>
<li> It went on wet and sticky and it stayed that way.  </li>
<li> I found that task was harder said than done.</li>
<li> the other store deodorants just didn&#x27;t work anymore...</li>

    <li> No aluminum in it, and it lasts, e.g., no body odor after full day of activity.</li>
    <li> My wife has been trying product after product for years and years now and when she purchased this one she said: &amp;#34;This is it!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;And, as all men know, if she is happy.....I am happy.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I&#x27;ve used just about every drugstore deodorant out there from Secret Clinical to Dove, Degree, and even the Thai Crystal Rock Deodorants-they all left my clothes smelling like sweat covered up by a fake fragerance and didn&#x27;t help me smell very nice. Enter this deodorant; it does it all, naturally, and I&#x27;m very pleased with how it works. I&#x27;m really not self concious about smelling bad anymore! The only thing is that you&#x27;ll have to re-apply this after a workout.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve searched all over --- tried the most expensive natural products and this is the only one that works.  Lasts forever!</li>
    <li> My daughter recommended this product, and she was right.  It does work, and will last a lot longer than the cake or spray products.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant I&#x27;ve used in a long time. I&#x27;m allergic to metal, yet unfortunately have hyperhidrosis, so I&#x27;m very limited by deodorant/anti-antiperspirant options. This is the only thing that keeps me feeling comfortable. Been using it for years &amp; won&#x27;t switch ever if I can help it.</li>
    <li> Ok, I decided to try and use a natural deodorant that didn&#x27;t have any antipersperants or aluminum in it. I found that task was harder said than done. Then I discovered this at my local health food market. I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before finding this product, I tried Toms of Maine deodorant which I was severely allergic to. It left my underarms bright lobster red and VERY itchy. I tried one of those crystal things and a variety of other natural type deodorants. They all wore off quickly and left me smelling less than fresh. None of them lasted for more than a few hours before I had to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The initial smell when putting it on reminds me of a toilet cleaning product. :( However, that smell quickly disappears and leaves you with neutral smelling underarms. It lasts most of the day. I am no longer worried about smelling badly. I lead a nature hike on the weekends and this product works great without needing to reapply after the hike!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So 4 stars because I dislike the \\&quot;herbal scent\\&quot; But thankfully it goes away quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy this again, but I think I will try the unscented one next.</li>
    <li> ..threw all the store bought deodorants away....will never use anything else again, and lasts forever</li>
    <li> Always a favorite of mine the light scent and easy application of Alvera roll ons is desirable in any deodorant product.  I also use the liquid roll on as a hair conditioning liquid and topical balm for skin irritations.</li>
    <li> After going vegan a year ago, I&#x27;ve tried about ten different deodorants. This is the only cruelty-free deodorant I&#x27;ve tried that actually keeps me fresh and non-stinky, even after use for over a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is mild, and while it&#x27;s nothing to get really excited about, I&#x27;d rather have a working deodorant that I know is ethical, than a really good smelling deodorant that has animal ingredients or tests on animals. If you tend not to smell much / at all, I&#x27;d probably recommend the Kiss My Face roll-on deodorant instead. It worked well for me for about a month, then stopped working in my right armpit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to note, this not an antiperspirant and as such will not stop you from sweating, it isn&#x27;t designed to.</li>
    <li> Have always used this brand once I quit using the non-natural deodorants.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used this roll-on product for many years and find it is not only effective but also non-irritating.  It is becoming almost impossible to locate in our local stores so he are happy it is still available from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I used Mitchums for 20 years because nothing seemed to hold me. After discovering the potential dangers of aluminum I tried various natural deodorants unsuccessfully. I started using Alvera&#x27;s [[ASIN:B0014ARGVG Deodorant-Aloe Herbal - 3 oz. - Roll-on]]Aloe Herbal Unscented Deodorant about 2 years ago and it holds me. I have recommended it to family members and friends. There are better prices available than through Amazon, shop around but I buy at [...]&lt;br /&gt;Update 8-8-12 see comments apparently this has aluminum in it. Will be looking around for something else.</li>
    <li> I have been using this deodorant for years.  I started using it when the commercial ones began causing pain under my arms.  This fragrance lasts all day and is safe to use - no antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> Works great and no aluminum- yay! A friend introduced me to this and as an athlete and gym-goer I was so doubtful, but as it turns out, this product works better than BAN, Secret Clinical Strength and several others while also reducing the chemicals.</li>
    <li> My brother and I are both unable to use traditional antiperspirants (we get terrible rashes). I started using this after a doctor told me to switch to a natural product when I was in high school, and this was one of the first products I tried. That was many, many years ago and I have loved and constantly used it since then. This doesn&#x27;t prevent you from sweating because it&#x27;s aluminum free, but you don&#x27;t get stinky when you sweat. When I&#x27;m in hot climates, I reapply it a few times during the day just to freshen up. It feels cool on the skin and smells fresh. My friend who normally uses traditional antiperspirant started using this from time  when wearing certain outfits because it doesn&#x27;t stain her clothing. I&#x27;ve tried other natural deodorants when Alvera has been sold out and haven&#x27;t found one that works better than this one. My brother uses this now too and it works for both of us. I&#x27;ve used both the almond and herbal, but much prefer the herbal. The almond reminds me of a danish:)</li>
    <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t keep me dry, it kept my underarms wet!  It went on wet and sticky and it stayed that way.  Not good!</li>
    <li> ITS THE ONLY I USE RIGHT NOW. PROTECT ME AT ALL.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great alternative to the chemical deodorants. I may need to reapply when it gets really hot out as I do sweat a lot.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year.  I like it, but it does not hold as well as an over the counter regular deoderant, but it does hold for a certain period of time. I will keep using it because it is a natural product.</li>
    <li> Mmmm. I smell good everyday for years.</li>
    <li> i saw this product at a friend&#x27;s house and decided to give it a shot...the other store deodorants just didn&#x27;t work anymore...i was surprised but so glad that this product works for me!</li>
    <li> Works well for me on an every-other-day basis in the summer and daily in the winter.  Great for sensitive skin!!</li>
    <li> I had been using this for probably 6 months. While I hated the smell, I stuck with it cause it was doing its job and because I thought it was all natural. I input the ingredients into the cosmetic database and it scores a 4 for this product which in this case I might as well use Secret deodorant or something! The reason for the score is for the allantoin. I found much better alternatives to this product at bubbleandbeecom and etsycom/bathlife .</li>
    <li> not many natural deodorants work for me, but this one does. i alternate different brands on different days because in the first years when i started experimenting with natural deodorants, i learned that a good one can eventually &amp;#34;stop&amp;#34; working. so i alternate to keep the bacteria from developing a resistance if that&#x27;s what you call it. i have at least 9 different brands because of so many trial and errors. so i use a diff one every day. even so, most of the natural ones fall down on the job. ALVERA IS AN EXCEPTION.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant. It is all natural, smells very mild and good and I have never smelled like perspiration. I can&#x27;t say the same about other all naturals.</li>
    <li> aloe herbal by far the best deoderant of all time!!! im a big sweater:( goes on and feels wet for a bit but is natural and way better for you:)</li>
    <li> Great to use instead of those you buy in grocery stores. Did not see any aluminum on it. Smells great! Just make sure you are not allergic to aloe vera or any of the other ingredients!</li>
    <li> MINUS 5.&lt;br /&gt;this product is not natural, it has  alcloxa  which is Aluminum.&lt;br /&gt;Description does not say this. You want to use natural product not this chemical base roll on.</li>
    <li> I really like this deodorant. I have very sensitive armpits and hated using the other name brand options since they either itched, irritated my skin or stained my clothes. They were also generally hard to soap off right away since they were so &amp;#34;caky.&amp;#34; I ended up having to let my armpits rest for a few days without chemicals, or apply aloe gel to help with the irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant works well for me to apply once I get out of the shower, and it lasts all day. I work out daily (about an hour of intense sweating) and even then it&#x27;s held up great. I&#x27;ve noticed for running I need a t-shirt with sleeves since the friction of my skin isn&#x27;t as protected as it would be with the other &amp;#34;sport&amp;#34; name brand ones, but I don&#x27;t mind wearing sleeves so that&#x27;s not a big deal. I&#x27;ve bought the aloe and the almond and prefer the almond one (it smells good). I&#x27;ve also tried the crystals, Tom&#x27;s, Kiss My Face, Arm N&#x27; Hammer and Naturally Fresh but definitely like this one better.</li>
    <li> I found this deodorant years ago when I discovered that regular deodorant irritated my skin and made me itch.  This deodorant keeps me fresher than any other natural deodorant I have found.  It isn&#x27;t a complete masking of scent, and you do have to get used to sweating if you&#x27;ve work anti-perspirant for years (you do get used to it), but it is gentle on my skin and gives me extra protection on regular days.  Nothing will help much when you are working out or in the heat for hours though!</li>
    <li> This is very effective for me, and I&#x27;d like to give it a high rating, but it&#x27;s true that, as other reviewers have noted, this deodorant deceptively advertises itself as &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; and as an &amp;#34;alternative to chemical deodorants&amp;#34; (a generally absurd claim, but that&#x27;s another story).  On its ingredient list is the antimicrobial astringent called Alcloxa, which contains Aluminum and is chemically related to the Aluminum Chlorohydrate that many people try to avoid in deodorants.  I don&#x27;t know if Aluminum in a deodorant is a true risk, or at what concentration it risks being a hazard, but in any case, the Alcloxa in this product is also known as ALUMINUM CHLORHYDROXY ALLANTOINATE, according to the EWG cosmetic database, http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/700214/ALCLOXA/&lt;br /&gt;The (arguably over-cautious) EWG deems Alcloxa a moderate health hazard.</li>
    <li> I was so happy when I discovered Alveras roll-on herbal deodorant in my grocery store (New Seasons).  You want to be careful about what kinds of strong chemicals you put in that area of glands right around major hubs of your lymphatic system, but you want a product that works well, too.  This one does both!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in an unscented version, which works just as well, and personally I love the smell of the aloe herbal one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My grocery store stopped carrying them, so I was made happy again when I found them available through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this deodorant anymore after discovering it had aluminum in it.  I make my own deodorants now. I don&#x27;t trust store bought ones.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product.  I am trying non-toxic/natural deodorants again.  I found myself still needing to reapply later in the day.  Soothing and not too fragrant.</li>
    <li> I have been using all natural deodorants for the last 10 years because I have a lot of cancer and Alzheimers in my family and I try to use all-natural products anyway. I purchased this deodorant almost a year ago in a health food store and found it to be the best and most effective \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorant I have ever used. I went online to order another and just noticed one of the ingredients. After a little googling, and reading other negative reviews, I realized that Alcloxa (with Allantoin) is really an aluminum compound and many people are outraged at the deceptive quality of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle advertises: SAFE AND EFFECTIVE, ALL-NATURAL, \\&quot;Our Unique lotion formula conditions your skin as it works to provide a safe and non-irritating, yet effective alternative to chemical deodorants.\\&quot; However, I am so sorely disappointed in this false advertising! I regret ever having bought this product, and using an aluminum compound on my body (FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR) UNKNOWINGLY!!! I also regret telling all of my friends to purchase this product because I thought it was the best \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorant out there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always look for keywords in deodorant like \\&quot;anti-perspirant\\&quot; and aluminum; instead this bottle just says \\&quot;designed to keep you dry and odor free.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel thoroughly deceived and outraged by false advertising, causing me to unknowingly allow a harmful compound into my body multiple times every day. SHAME ON THIS COMPANY. I hope that no one else falls into the same trap as I did. THERE IS ALUMINUM IN THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product cleverly hides the fact that it contains aluminum hydroxide by cloaking it under the tradename of \\&quot;Alcloxa,\\&quot; which is a combination of allantion and aluminum hydroxide. But instead of admitting that, the label reads that Alcloxa \\&quot;contains allantoin.\\&quot; Shady tactics at best; unhealthy product at worst.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, and haven&#x27;t liked them- but this one is just perfect. Can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough. Used to have to get it at a specific store in New York, then I moved away. I was so glad to see it on sale online!</li>
    <li> This deodorant works well BUT I have discovered 2 troubling ingredients.  One is Alcloxa and the other is T.E.A.  Look them up and decide for yourself.</li>
    <li> I am sad to learn that the alcloxa ingredient is a derivative of aluminum, albeit organic and low toxicity per www.ewg.org, but I want to avoid aluminum. I used this product for 6 months before realizing it&#x27;s ingredients. Aside from the alcloxa, for me this product worked for about 4-8 hours, does not irritate, &amp; takes time to dry. The scent is okay and diminished thru the day. Often I would apply in morning and afternoon because I would begin to smell bad. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> My Bad - I thought there was only the one product aloe &amp; ALMOND.  So be careful this product is the aloe only and not nearly as good as the aloe and almond!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Smells so good and is all natural</li>
</ol>
