      <li>Nice light scent.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this cleanser.</li>
      <li>Not to mention it&#x27;s not oily and leaves your face feeling really smooth!</li>
      <li>Overall love the product!!!</li>
      <li>At first I got it because I read so many good review of it on Amazon a year ago.</li>
      <li>My skin face is getting brighter and brighter without using any whitening cream thanks to this amazing product!</li>
      <li>For $11, it&#x27;s a pretty good cleanser..</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m super loving it.</li>
      <li>I originally tried it while I was in Korea and immediately fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>the Asian culture uses rice for a lot of things and after years of seeing the majority of the women with beautiful skin, I figured&lt;br</li>
      <li>Paired with my electronic scrub brush and my skin is free of dirt and oils.</li>
      <li>It has a light neutral odor when you&#x27;re using it</li>
      <li>but it is a great regular face soap.</li>
      <li>But overall great product.</li>
      <li>Has a light flowery perfume smell which is alright.</li>
      <li>like i said, worth 450 pennies, and not one more.  </li>
      <li>At first I thought it was working pretty good.</li>
      <li>I just feel very fresh afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i love this so much!</li>
      <li>It keeps my face clean throughout the day and helps a bit with my sometimes oily skin.</li>
      <li>My skin felt clean almost squeaky while rinsing but not too drying.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is noticeable yet washes off without lingering and is pleasant enough.  </li>
      <li>it smells great, not fake-chemical-bathandbodyworks kind of smell, but a subtle clean rice scent.</li>
      <li>My face feels super clean without drying or tightness.</li>
      <li>Left a clean refreshing texture, no oily skin!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many like St. Ives, Neutrogena, Clean and clear, etc.</li>
      <li>Give this product a try; it has a light smell and s gentle foam.</li>
      <li>for the price it would be worth my while to try it..</li>
      <li>Totally worth it</li>
      <li>but it did seem to brighten up my skin right away.</li>
      <li>i love korean products in general, but this makes my skin feel like a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
      <li>mild n gentle</li>
      <li>It has completely transformed my skin, in such a good way.</li>
      <li>Doesnt make your face tight and lasts for a good amount of time.</li>
      <li>Very gentle but still gets my makeup off.</li>
      <li>I am curious about the other face shop cleansers but this was great!</li>
      <li>First let me start by saying that just because a beauty product isn&#x27;t $30+, doesn&#x27;t render it ineffective.</li>
      <li>and it really does make your face brighter/lighter!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it!!</li>
      <li>It feels like it cleans pretty well, but if you have blackheads or pimples, I don’t know if this will help you.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin so soft and clean without drying your skin.</li>
      <li>Not to mention it only takes an incredibly tiny amount to work up a good lather.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t make much foam when I first used it, and the smell wasn&#x27;t as nice as other people have described.</li>
      <li>Rice is rich in a complex of B vitamins called ‘inositol’ that helps promote cell growth, slows down the aging process and stimulates blood flow – the perfect recipe to tighten pores and brighten the face.</li>
      <li>and you follow the cleanser up with a really soothing cream or something.</li>
      <li>I am an Esthetician (skin care specialist) and I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>What I like most is how you only need a tiny dot of cleanser to do the trick.</li>
      <li>It is an effective, creamy cleanser that completely washes off face makeup and sunscreen (haven&#x27;t tested its efficacy on washing off eye makeup however), smells delicately powdery, floral, and fresh, but most importantly, is not abrasive or overly stripping on the skin.</li>
      <li>Came a week early!!</li>
      <li>But it seemed brightened my face a little bit after i used it, so I guess after all, it was an okay cleanser to use</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> the Asian culture uses rice for a lot of things and after years of seeing the majority of the women with beautiful skin, I figured&lt;br /&gt;that for the price it would be worth my while to try it.. and it panned out. my skin loves this cleaner. ( I have the T-zone, combination&lt;br /&gt;skin type. I am also 50 years old and have been very skin  conscious all my life. My skin is considered exceptional , esp for my&lt;br /&gt;age from both doctors and peers. I beleive prevention has been the key!,</li>
    <li> when I first used this product, i was a bit disappointed, it wasn&#x27;t as good as i thought it would be. It didn&#x27;t make much foam when I first used it, and the smell wasn&#x27;t as nice as other people have described. But it seemed brightened my face a little bit after i used it, so I guess after all, it was an okay cleanser to use</li>
    <li> I tried this product due to a sample given in a gift. At first I thought it was working pretty good. But a month or so later my skin got extremely dry and had an insane break out. Based on my experience with this product, it may work if you have ridiculously oily skin and you follow the cleanser up with a really soothing cream or something. Yet , I would not recommend this to someone with sensitive skin (like me.)</li>
    <li> I really love this cleansing foam</li>
    <li> I have always love this product. Paired with my electronic scrub brush and my skin is free of dirt and oils.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Unlike other cleansers from The Face Shop, it is powerful but NOT DRY AT ALL. I love its scent.</li>
    <li> My face feels super clean without drying or tightness. Nice light scent barely noticeable but somehow very pleasant.  Seller was very thoughtful in how they packaged it up for shipping and sent along some nice samples along with it . I will be repurchasing unless by some miracle I come across  an even nicer cleanser.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a licensed aesthetician and Panchakarma therapist, and will share with you some wonderful information about this amazing product. First let me start by saying that just because a beauty product isn&#x27;t $30+, doesn&#x27;t render it ineffective. Keeping that in mind, for someone to achieve certain skin care results, isn&#x27;t so much a matter of a specific dollar amount in a product, as much as it is a specific ingredient in a product.&lt;br /&gt;  I purchased this product when the Clinique product I normally used was on backorder, and I needed it stat. How I could not have found this product before, is beyond me,... Geishas have known about the benefits of rice water for centuries!!&lt;br /&gt;  Rice is rich in a complex of B vitamins called ‘inositol’ that helps promote cell growth, slows down the aging process and stimulates blood flow – the perfect recipe to tighten pores and brighten the face. Besides this, rice water also has moisturising, antioxidant and UV-absorbing properties, along with an ability to bind to naturally occurring copper in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;  The Face Shop&#x27;s Rice Water Cream has a wonderful emolliency and provides a rich lather/foam. I use it working with my fingertips in the morning, and use it in conjunction with a konjac sponge at night. I recommend this to clients wanting to improve their complexion and skin texture, as part of their at home treatment. I also pinned* this product to my &amp;#34;Must Have&amp;#34; product for 2015. I will exclusively make future purchases from this seller only!</li>
    <li> I originally tried it while I was in Korea and immediately fell in love with it. This stuff is really good! It considerable brighten my face and helped with black spots as well. Highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I really like how well this removes makeup, yet it leaves my face feeling moisturized and not dry and tight like most cleansers do. I don&#x27;t know how much it actually brightens my face, but it&#x27;s what I&#x27;m looking for. Not to mention it only takes an incredibly tiny amount to work up a good lather. This is gonna last awhile.</li>
    <li> It smells really good and it foams well. It&#x27;s a little awkward to screw open while your hands are wet, put into your palm, screw cap back on, and start scrubbing but you get used to it after awhile. It feels like it delivers moisture and it does not leave my skin dry at all. It does not help prevent acne but it is a great regular face soap.</li>
    <li> Came a week early!! Left a clean refreshing texture, no oily skin! I could see the possibility of having dried skin if some sort of moisture isn&#x27;t used afterward- if the product is used daily. Has a light flowery perfume smell which is alright. Maybe just my imagination but it did seem to brighten up my skin right away. Overall love the product!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best cleansing product out there.&lt;br /&gt;It truly leaves your face not oily and soft! I have tried lots of things that tend to leave my sky dry but this one is marvelous.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.</li>
    <li> quality is good and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, takes a while to ship and has a strong fragrance which is kind of a mix of sweet perfume and baby lotion</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cleanser. It leaves my skin so soft and clean without drying your skin. It also has a very light but nice smell.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser! I use it once a day in the morning, and I&#x27;ve noticed that my face has brightened over time since using it.</li>
    <li> Loveliest face wash&lt;br /&gt;Best results&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
    <li> This is currently my everyday cleansing foam. At first I got it because I read so many good review of it on Amazon a year ago. Well, it really is a nice product. This is now my second tube already and I&#x27;m super loving it.</li>
    <li> So smooth and so clean !!!</li>
    <li> i would love washing my face with this cleanser! It has a nice smell, and leaves your face feeling nice, bright and soft. a little of the product goes a long way. I have don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about this cleanser. Love it and i will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I wish I could purchase this locally; but now I know to order in advance.&lt;br /&gt;I was gifted to find this in a magazine where it peaked my interest. I&#x27;m always looking for ways to make my skin look and feel better and THIS product does just that!&lt;br /&gt;My face is softer, smoother, cleaner, and younger looking! My skin GLOWS! I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about it. It has completely transformed my skin, in such a good way. This is MY secret and I don&#x27;t tell many people about it because I want to keep it ALL to myself (kidding I do tell a select few ha ha). You could NEVER buy this size or this quality locally and that&#x27;s a shame....however, THE FACE SHOP has my business LONG TERM. Give this product a try; it has a light smell and s gentle foam. It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> Really nice. I like it!</li>
    <li> I use this at the end of my day. It give you a squeaky clean feeling but not too tight and uncomfortable like other products. I also use it with the Arsainte Eco-Therapy line. After I wash my face I use the face shop arsainte eco-therapy tonic along with the daily moisturizer. If my face could kiss me it would. It reveals a brighter skin. I&#x27;ve tried many like St. Ives, Neutrogena, Clean and clear, etc. the St. Ives Green Tea Moisturizer works for my exfoliating purposes but I&#x27;m out so I wanted to try something different &amp; I Love this I would recommend this product along with the eco-therapy line because after you wash you will need to moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck&lt;br /&gt;XOXO&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> i was hoping a creamy, foamy cleanser would be perfect for me... my skin is oily, but very sensitive to drying cleansers.  and i wanted to brighten my skin and fade my summer freckles.  i have no idea how well it brightens because i&#x27;ve only used it for a few days, twice a day, but i CAN tell you that it is extremely drying to my skin.  like i said, worth 450 pennies, and not one more.  i will not even finish the tube, let alone reorder...</li>
    <li> I used my hub account to order&lt;br /&gt;Very mild n gentle&lt;br /&gt;it does not dry out your face&lt;br /&gt;smells like flower - my bro said&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not for makeup cleaning&lt;br /&gt;maybe for morning</li>
    <li> For $11, it&#x27;s a pretty good cleanser.. it smells great, not fake-chemical-bathandbodyworks kind of smell, but a subtle clean rice scent. The product is a little greasy when you squeeze some out (and you only need a tiny bit!), but it washes off so very cleanly. I just feel very fresh afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However! I think the product is so watery that it always, always gets into my eyes and it STINGS! I try to avoid washing my eyes with it now, but I wish it would help wash away eye makeup. But no matter how much I rinse and how much I thought it is gone.. a tiny bit gets into my eye and stings like hell and I scream a little afterwards. Kinda ruins the &#x27;ahhh so fresh&#x27; experience.</li>
    <li> I just started using this. I haven’t noticed any major differences but my skin is a little softer.  What I like most is how you only need a tiny dot of cleanser to do the trick. A little goes a long way my friend! It feels like it cleans pretty well, but if you have blackheads or pimples, I don’t know if this will help you. I have dry skin and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s stripping away at my skin. But it does have a flowery smell to it. So if you don&#x27;t like fragrances you may want to rethink purchasing this.</li>
    <li> very smooth. a little whiter after use.</li>
    <li> Loved this face wash, it gives great results.</li>
    <li> I have tried various types of cleansing foams and I have to say this one is one of the best I have used. It keeps my face clean throughout the day and helps a bit with my sometimes oily skin. Doesnt make your face tight and lasts for a good amount of time. I also love that you only have to use about a dime size, so it lasts for a long time.</li>
    <li> Gentle and smells great! I&#x27;ve used it almost everyday and I&#x27;m in love with it!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, fast shipping. Thank you</li>
    <li> If you want something that can don your hair and your skin and is so concentrated that a TSA sized bottle will last your entire vacation, you just found it.  It has a light neutral odor when you&#x27;re using it but it doesn&#x27;t leave any odor on you. It cleans your hair and skin with out drying or greasing. It rinses away easily and works well even in cold or hard water.  It is not suitable as a disinfectant.</li>
    <li> Size provider and a good price</li>
    <li> i love korean products in general, but this makes my skin feel like a baby&#x27;s bottom! soooo soft! i love this so much! would recommend to anybody!</li>
    <li> One dab onto your brush with a little water and you&#x27;ll have a blanket of pillow soft bubbles coating your face.  I love this product and it&#x27;s paraben-free. The fragrance is noticeable yet washes off without lingering and is pleasant enough.  It felt gentle enough; I will update my review if this causes irritation/break-outs or if there are any problems.  My skin is hyper sensitive and acne-prone (although thankfully you&#x27;d never guess); I work hard to keep my skin looking soap-commercial porcelain clear.</li>
    <li> I am curious about the other face shop cleansers but this was great! My skin felt clean almost squeaky while rinsing but not too drying. My skin felt tight after but I do have combination to dry skin. I recommend a great moisturizer after use if needed. But overall great product. I recommend! :)</li>
    <li> Does its work. Acceptable Price.</li>
    <li> I love cleansers from the faceshop and I&#x27;d have to say, this was a great product! Totally worth it and it really does make your face brighter/lighter! Not to mention it&#x27;s not oily and leaves your face feeling really smooth!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin.  Did not work for me.  But my friend loves it.  Cleared up her cystic acne. Nice light scent.</li>
    <li> I am an Esthetician (skin care specialist) and I really like this product.  Nice, foaming cleanser...not too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Makes your skin soft and supple. Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. It is an effective, creamy cleanser that completely washes off face makeup and sunscreen (haven&#x27;t tested its efficacy on washing off eye makeup however), smells delicately powdery, floral, and fresh, but most importantly, is not abrasive or overly stripping on the skin. I use this in the shower at night and at the sink in the morning to wash my face, and personally I want a cleanser that is strong enough to get all that caked up makeup, or accumulated natural oils off. I stress that this product is not overly stripping--I have oily, acne prone skin (from occasional cystic acne, to white heads, and a few blackheads now and again) and this does not burn or aggravate it in any way. I should note that I do the double cleansing method of following this with Shea Moisture&#x27;s African black soap, just to feel like I&#x27;ve restored some moisture to my face, as I like to veer on the side of oily rather than dry feeling skin. Lastly, a little of this goes a long way because it lathers a lot. I got it last winter and am just now squeezing the last of it out.</li>
    <li> My favorite facial wash hands down. It have definitely brightened my face and made it illuminate. I will be using specifically this facial from now on. :) My face is even lighter as well. Your face may feel a bit flaky and dry after washing but apply some face moisturizer and you&#x27;re good!</li>
    <li> This and the Rice Cleansing Oil will be my go-to facial cleansers from now on. Very gentle but still gets my makeup off. I have sensitive skin and have had wonderful results with this product.</li>
    <li> Just 1 word : AMAZING !!! It does what it says. My skin feels so good and smooth after using it. My skin face is getting brighter and brighter without using any whitening cream thanks to this amazing product! I&#x27;ll sure purchase this thing again and again !</li>
