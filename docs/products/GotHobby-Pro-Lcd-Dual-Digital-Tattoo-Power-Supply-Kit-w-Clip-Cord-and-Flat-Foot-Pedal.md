<li> Just be careful plugging in the power cord.</li>
<li> The second one works for about 30 minutes, then loses power and dies.</li>
<li> Purchased this dual power supplu arrived on time opend it and the bad thing is when i tested the p.s after aprox 20 the voltage falls down at a lower voltage.</li>
<li> Nothing seemed to be wrong with any of the cords.</li>
<li> BAD BAD</li>
<li> BAD</li>
<li> I had to take it apart and fix it :(</li>
<li> BAD BAD!!!</li>

    <li> Keeps steady power, a decent set up for beginners.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t gotten it yet but it will work better then my last one</li>
    <li> Great deal ..very happy</li>
    <li> Feels a little cheap but works well. Just be careful plugging in the power cord.</li>
    <li> Broke after 4 days...please do not buy it&#x27;s trash</li>
    <li> the back power plug broke I didn&#x27;t even have it for two days. very cheaply made. I had to take it apart and fix it :(</li>
    <li> plugged in once and powered on&lt;br /&gt;tried setting it up to tattoo....wont even turn on. sent a request to exchange it, waiting for a reply at this point. will come back to update once I hear back from the source.</li>
    <li> I bought power supply as my second source and came in great time.  Shipping was perfect. Packing was great. It came with every item that was listed. Nothing seemed to be wrong with any of the cords. Plugged in and works great. Tatted 1 tattoo and put back into box and still using as back power supply.</li>
    <li> Way good. Powers&lt;br /&gt;Everything. Real good so if you need one get this. And that&#x27;s. All I have on that</li>
    <li> Arrived on time works better than expected!</li>
    <li> exelente producto hace 15 me llego en perfecto estado  exelente producto en exelente estado y todos sus componentes en perfecto estado</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still learning the tattoo life but I watch my tatoo man use this so I liked u got 2 clip corp out let &amp; foot paddle it  called my name</li>
    <li> But not much else I can say positive. When you plug the power cord into the back it feels like you could break the plastic if your not careful. The button to switch from line to shade feels hokie and loose. It is much lighter than I expected I don&#x27;t know if that is good or bad. Overall it just feels VERY cheep</li>
    <li> Everything&#x27;s great except that the clip cords did not come with it, and I&#x27;ve been waiting 3 weeks for the clip cords to arrive.</li>
    <li> it was nothing as shown in the picture.. i was very upset about it.. However i did get the cords and the pedal as shown. Not buying this item again..</li>
    <li> works amazing and is up to my standards no problems at all would recommend to anyone looking to buy one</li>
    <li> Purchased this dual power supplu arrived on time opend it and the bad thing is when i tested the p.s after aprox 20 the voltage falls down at a lower voltage. Turnd up voltage to aprov 9 works for a while then falls to a lower voltage.. so purchased a diffrent p.s</li>
    <li> This model is glitchy. I had two, and both are tempermental at best. One quit working entirely after about three weeks. The second one works for about 30 minutes, then loses power and dies. I do no recommend. I also missed the return cut off, so am stuck with two power supplies that can&#x27;t be used for my business. I liked the dual set up on this so I could easily switch between my liner and my shader, but if not working, it makes no difference. To stop mid tattoo to go back to my old power supply was worse than switching cords to begin with.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and expected&amp;#34;</li>
