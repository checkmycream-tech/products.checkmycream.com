### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The best part about it though is probably the price.</li>

      <li>sure if this craem lives upto its &#x27;anti-wrinkle&#x27; cliam.</li>
      <li>I love Avon products and have been using them for three years now.</li>
      <li>I love this item.</li>
      <li>I have paid much more for creams that do nothing.  </li>
      <li>gave this product 5 stars because i love how it leaves my skin feeling</li>
      <li>I like to think it is. :)</li>
      <li>My skin is smoother, more hydrated,brighter,tighter, and softer.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using both products and I love them both.  </li>
      <li>I really love this cream.</li>
      <li>Have reordered many times.</li>
      <li>I will keep buying to see a better result of my skin.</li>
      <li>I then decided to try one more....</li>
      <li>(thank you Grandma : )</li>
      <li>I love the Avon Anew Reversalist Night Renewal Cream.</li>
      <li>but the results are pretty good</li>
      <li>, always had that burning sensation most experience, but it would subside in about 30 minutes, leaving my skin smooth as glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until</li>
      <li>This is the best night moisturizer (for me) hands down.</li>
      <li>After 3 or 4 days my skin was fine.</li>
      <li>I went from tight, stinging skin to a wonderfully renewed, moisturized feeling, that was not at all greasy.</li>
      <li>It is on the thicker side in texture so if you are looking for a light moisturizer this is not for you.</li>
      <li>Now that the Ageless Solutions is no longer available...</li>
      <li>The samples are free so if you end up not liking the product, you haven&#x27;t put any money into it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not saying it perfect but for $30 it works great and it is definitely one of the few brands that gives me noticeably clearer and brighter skin.</li>
      <li>I have been moisturizing my skin and generally taking really good care of it since I was 16</li>
      <li>My daughter tells people she has good genes when they say I look younger than my age.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes though, to see how great it is, I try other products.</li>
      <li>arrived quickly, would recommend</li>
      <li>When I first used it, my face did have a mild reaction to it.</li>
      <li>i am only 21, and i have been using it for 3 months now, and it makes my skin so much more fresh and uplifting.</li>
      <li>I have used Anew before, purchased directly from Avon and noticed huge difference.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Avon Anew since it first came out about 21 years ago.  </li>
      <li>I tried it and on the first day nothing happened.</li>
      <li>It is beginning to look healthier and for the first time in years I am receiving complements about my skin.</li>
      <li>I have tried nearly all of the midlevel moisturizers and this makes my skin feel fantastic.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years, but be aware that an over sensitivity can happen at any time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Most recently, I tried Oil of Olay and L&#x27;Oreal and both of these products were over fragranced and clogged my pores.</li>
      <li>did nothing different in my routine, but the burning was seeming a bit more intense.</li>
      <li>I am a die-hard long time user of another well known brand of skin care products but I love the feel and results of this product.  </li>
      <li>I just wanted to note here that if you&#x27;ve never used this product before, you really should try a sample first.</li>
      <li>i would only recommend using this cream at night tho, because it is a little bit heavier and can be greasy depending on how much you put on, but in the morning your skin is beautiful.</li>
      <li>pores became large, color of skin was blotchy.</li>
      <li>This one is light enough to wear in the summer, and doesn&#x27;t burn my skin.</li>
      <li>I really like this night cream.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
      <li>But really ladies, there&#x27;s no stopping time with over the counter products.</li>
      <li>Not oily or greasy yet very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Its very moisturizing and hydrating which is what I look for in skincare.</li>
      <li>I really like this night</li>
      <li>Love the smell and texture, and how it makes my skin feel, but be careful, because it causes sun sensitivity.</li>
      <li>Really like this product.</li>
      <li>Avon has really stepped it up.</li>
      <li>There was so much swelling</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>It really does &amp;#34;RENEW&amp;#34; the appearance of my skin.</li>
      <li>Maybe older people with a much dryer skin will benefit from it.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money elsewhere unless your a movie star and want to try the high scale products and can afford them, however, Anew&#x27;s price and quality is better than the higher end brands from my point of view.</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt; Highly recommend these products.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>With sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve not been able to use other creams containing retin-based ingredients.</li>
      <li>I love all of them, however, this night cream is a little too fluent and oily.</li>
      <li>i have tried a few olay creams and find this cream has better and quicker results</li>
      <li>My skin looks smoother, more clear, and less blotchy using this night cream.</li>
      <li>But I had heard it can take a week for your skin to get used to a new moisturizer</li>
      <li>I had to give this 3 stars because although it made my skin feel very soft, it also caused breakouts all over my face.</li>
      <li>but this stuff has fixed it all!  </li>
      <li>but people say my skin looks like a 30 year old!</li>
      <li>This is such a rich and &amp;#34;Good Feeling&amp;#34;, Cream on my dry skin, I chose to call it &amp;#34;Delicious&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I have been using this nightly for one month and have really seen improvements with my overall skin tone and pores!  </li>
      <li>A Medical Spa has much stronger ingredients in their products</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Too sad to see this line being stripped of products that work... Please bring the serum back.  This is a great product.</li>
    <li> I love the Avon Anew Reversalist Night Renewal Cream. When I first used it, my face did have a mild reaction to it. But I had heard it can take a week for your skin to get used to a new moisturizer so I stuck with it. After 3 or 4 days my skin was fine. And now I just love it! If you have sensitive skin, I suggest getting with an actual Avon salesperson in your area and getting a trial size or even just a few samples. The samples are free so if you end up not liking the product, you haven&#x27;t put any money into it.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for two weeks.  No breakouts, irritation or negative reaction.  So far it&#x27;s very good considering the price.  I like Avon products.</li>
    <li> I am 40 years old with a normal skin type and a few lines on forehead and eyes, and this cream is extremelly greasy, it feels and looks like I covered my face in oil. Maybe older people with a much dryer skin will benefit from it.</li>
    <li> I am a die-hard long time user of another well known brand of skin care products but I love the feel and results of this product.  I will keep using it &#x27;cause it makes me look sooooo good.</li>
    <li> The quality of this product is different from buying it directly from Avon.</li>
    <li> This night cream is a lighter cream and didn&#x27;t see any difference for me.  I stepped up the avon anew to the ultimate.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to note here that if you&#x27;ve never used this product before, you really should try a sample first. I tried it and on the first day nothing happened. On the second day I noted some puffiness around my eyes, but chalked it up to a poor night&#x27;s rest. On the third day my eyes were puffed almost closed and my entire face was swollen and red! There was so much swelling I found it difficult to swallow! Needless to say it will be the last time I use this product. Fortunately I just bought a sample, so I&#x27;m only out a few bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  And my search for a good, cruelty-free, renewing moisturizer continues. If anyone knows of anything, let me know.</li>
    <li> I use this product with anew reversalist serum as part of my nightly skin care regime.  My skin is smoother, more hydrated,brighter,tighter, and softer.  I&#x27;ve been using both products and I love them both.  Thank-you Avon for affordable anti-aging skin care products.  This product is also a keeper for me.</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel!!!  it feels moisturized and not geasy...and my face doesn&#x27;t look shiney.</li>
    <li> I have tried many kinds of face cream with average to no change in dry skin patches. I then decided to try one more....in only 1 night I noticed a change!  My face had a smoothness that I havent had in years if ever!! I am very pleased with this product as well as most avon skin products.</li>
    <li> When using other creams, I almost always get piple like outburst on my face, thanks to my oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;Avon night craem is different. It gives the moisture without causing excessive oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if this craem lives upto its &#x27;anti-wrinkle&#x27; cliam. But nothing I have tried has lived upto it either..</li>
    <li> I love Avon products and have been using them for three years now. Now that the Ageless Solutions is no longer available...or it is in limited quantities, I&#x27;ve changed to the Anew products. I love all of them, however, this night cream is a little too fluent and oily. It isn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; as I would have expected the cream to be. I love the fragrance and it leaves my skin with a nice glow. Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so greasy. I will use it again though.</li>
    <li> arrived quickly, would recommend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so very sorry to say that, after having used this line of moisturizers and cleansers and loving it, I must discontinue its use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, always had that burning sensation most experience, but it would subside in about 30 minutes, leaving my skin smooth as glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the other evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did nothing different in my routine, but the burning was seeming a bit more intense. It subsided after a couple of hours, and I went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I woke up the next morning, my face was fushia, looking like I had steam burns, with open and weeping patches. I also had a pinpoint rash from my hairline to my chin. My eyes began to swell shut, my skin continued to weep, and eventually, my face blew up like a balloon. I had to get an emergency shot of Medrol (a fast-acting steroid) and will now be on prednisone for 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I must discontinue usage, for others this product, along with the daytime formula and eye cream, is one of the best out there. Just be careful, and if you develop any signs of rash, itching, or excessive burning, do be sure to cease usage. I&#x27;ve been using it for years, but be aware that an over sensitivity can happen at any time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to dearly miss this product. :(</li>
    <li> I use the night cream every night after I take off my makeup and it feels so nice on my skin! I usually have very dry skin in the winter, but this year I have not had any problems with my skin drying and flaking. I really love this cream.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  Product as expected.  I&#x27;ve been buying this for several years.</li>
    <li> I love this item. It makes me feel very good as a night cream. I will keep buying to see a better result of my skin.</li>
    <li> I used this product ..and am at the end of the jar. Made no difference. I suspect seller is trying to pass off ordinary cream as Anew. I have used Anew before, purchased directly from Avon and noticed huge difference. With same product sold on Amazon, no difference at all. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> Product is too heavy for my face (break-outs), but works a treat on my neck. Leaves it wonderfully moisturized and helps with the dreaded turkey-wattle.</li>
    <li> I have used Lorea, Oil of Olay, ecetera.  Had stopped using Anew for 8 months and went to the store brought brands.  Skin sagged, pores became large, color of skin was blotchy.Purchase Anew again and with three days noticed tightening in pores and skin lifting tighter.  No joke!   Anew is the Best!  Don&#x27;t waste your money elsewhere unless your a movie star and want to try the high scale products and can afford them, however, Anew&#x27;s price and quality is better than the higher end brands from my point of view.</li>
    <li> Great item as describe</li>
    <li> Works good, nice price</li>
    <li> I had to give this 3 stars because although it made my skin feel very soft, it also caused breakouts all over my face. From the time I started using it I started breaking out and it was continuous until i stopped. Very disappointing</li>
    <li> This product had change my acne laden skin to something of beauty. This in combination with the foaming cleanser have cleared some of the dark spots left by acne and overall improved the feel of my skin. It is beginning to look healthier and for the first time in years I am receiving complements about my skin.</li>
    <li> a little heavy cream but the results are pretty good</li>
    <li> I was hoping to see some changes.. finished entire bottle... still waiting.</li>
    <li> Great product. This is the only night cream that I use.</li>
    <li> Great price and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Have reordered many times.</li>
    <li> gave this product 5 stars because i love how it leaves my skin feeling and my skin has never looked better!</li>
    <li> I have now been using the anew products for the last couple months and I like the way my skin feels as well as I like the cost.&lt;br /&gt; I have always used expensive products for the last 20 years and decided to try to save some money and do not regret it.&lt;br /&gt; Highly recommend these products.</li>
    <li> This is such a rich and &amp;#34;Good Feeling&amp;#34;, Cream on my dry skin, I chose to call it &amp;#34;Delicious&amp;#34;. I went from tight, stinging skin to a wonderfully renewed, moisturized feeling, that was not at all greasy.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and texture, and how it makes my skin feel, but be careful, because it causes sun sensitivity.</li>
    <li> Really like this product. I use it along with the Anew Reversalist day cream and together I feel like my face is being protected and moisturized. And maybe it&#x27;s helping with the wrinkles...if that&#x27;s even possible. I like to think it is. :)</li>
    <li> Love this line....works great</li>
    <li> I was unsure about buying Avon. I had used it years ago and was not impressed. Avon has really stepped it up. I have tried allot of face products all with no results. This night cream is a good choice. You can always find it lower priced through Avon or Amazon.  When you use this cream your face feels refreshed and moisturized. It is on the thicker side in texture so if you are looking for a light moisturizer this is not for you.</li>
    <li> As usual Avon has not let me down. This product gives your skin a velvet feel to touch. Not oily or greasy yet very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I really like this night cream- i am only 21, and i have been using it for 3 months now, and it makes my skin so much more fresh and uplifting. my mother-in-law gave this cream to me from an collection of hers, she was just never used so she told me to give it a try, and within the first week of using it my skin wasn&#x27;t as dry anymore and i also had less break-outs. i would only recommend using this cream at night tho, because it is a little bit heavier and can be greasy depending on how much you put on, but in the morning your skin is beautiful. i was really impressed by this product and how cheap it is compared to some of the olay face creams- i have tried a few olay creams and find this cream has better and quicker results</li>
    <li> The products feels great going on. But really ladies, there&#x27;s no stopping time with over the counter products. A Medical Spa has much stronger ingredients in their products but alas, still no stopping time. But I do get noticeable results with their products vs. anything over the counter.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite face moisturizers!!!  Avon Anew is a great skincare line ....</li>
    <li> used it for years. like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for over 4 years now. Sometimes though, to see how great it is, I try other products. Most recently, I tried Oil of Olay and L&#x27;Oreal and both of these products were over fragranced and clogged my pores. I&#x27;m stickling to this product in the future.</li>
    <li> Not the miracle cure for wrinkles but does moisturizer well night or day.  I use it with the avon majix face perfecter.</li>
    <li> My skin looks smoother, more clear, and less blotchy using this night cream.</li>
    <li> I really like this night cream. Its very moisturizing and hydrating which is what I look for in skincare. The best part about it though is probably the price. I&#x27;m not saying it perfect but for $30 it works great and it is definitely one of the few brands that gives me noticeably clearer and brighter skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best night cream I&#x27;ve ever used. With sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve not been able to use other creams containing retin-based ingredients. This one is light enough to wear in the summer, and doesn&#x27;t burn my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Avon product for years! It is a great night moisturizer. Not greasy. I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Avon Anew since it first came out about 21 years ago.  I have used it faithfully.  My daughter tells people she has good genes when they say I look younger than my age.  I think it&#x27;s the Anew.  : )</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff I have purchased ever!  I just came back to buy the day cream!  THIS works!  I have been using this nightly for one month and have really seen improvements with my overall skin tone and pores!  NO BREAKOUTS!!  Here I thought they were hormonal but this stuff has fixed it all!  I can&#x27;t say enough!  I googled &amp;#34;best night creams&amp;#34; and this one was in my budget. You may notice a slight tingling when you start to use it especially with a newly washed clean face.  It only happened a couple times but if you have ever used ADHD in products it is the same sensation.  It really does &amp;#34;RENEW&amp;#34; the appearance of my skin. I have paid much more for creams that do nothing.  BUY this!  I hope the day cream is as good!</li>
    <li> This is the best night moisturizer (for me) hands down. I have been moisturizing my skin and generally taking really good care of it since I was 16 (thank you Grandma : ) I have tried nearly all of the midlevel moisturizers and this makes my skin feel fantastic. All of the lines that find their way onto my face through the day are gone by morning. I&#x27;m 42 but people say my skin looks like a 30 year old! Highly recommended.</li>
