      <li>This shampoo really leaves your hair super-soft.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years and really like it.</li>

      <li>Not a good combo for smooth hair all day.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t normally use conditioner due to that fact.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Infusium 23 Moisture Replenishment Shampoo cleans well and for those with short hair, a single washing is usually all that is necessary to get the hair clean.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Infusium 23 Moisture Replenishment Shampoo is a good product that helps those with dry hair by moisturizing the strands of hair, making them less brittle and hair more manageable. My hair and scalp are dry and I count on shampoo products like this to help alleviate the problem. Infusium 23 Moisture Replenishment Shampoo does exactly that- it adds moisture to dried- out hair strands and helps keep hair under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Infusium 23 Moisture Replenishment Shampoo cleans well and for those with short hair, a single washing is usually all that is necessary to get the hair clean. The product builds up a very good amount of lather- more than other shampoos and probably more than necessary. This fact concerned me at first, because I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t rinse out very easily. Fortunately, that isn&#x27;t the case. It takes little effort and the shampoo is gone in seconds. The final result is a head of hair that is shinier than average, feels moisturized, and is free from worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this Infusium product overall, but one area in which I am undecided is the scent. It is like bar soap with a small amount of perfume and while I am pretty sure the manufacturer intended the scent to be gender- neutral, it is more on the feminine side and some men will not like it. I find it tolerable and certainly not so bad that I would discontinue use. Still, it would be nice if it had a little more masculine scent or if there was another version available with an aroma more in tune with the needs of men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry hair is a problem and those who have dry hair know that it takes patience and special hair care products to get the dryness under control. Infusium 23 Moisture Replenishment Shampoo is a good product for this purpose. It makes hair feel more moisturized, adds shine, and adds to manageability. It is a little on the pricy side and the scent could be a problem for some users, but the product is still a good one that performs the way the manufacturer promises.es.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo, just cheaper elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;This is my 15 extra words.&lt;br /&gt;More of the same.&lt;br /&gt;And More of the same.</li>
    <li> Why does the seller show two bottles?  I thought I was getting two bottles when I opened up my box.  This is very MISLEADING to the customers.  I sure the seller have it like this on purpose to make customers think they are getting two bottles.  I&#x27;m not pleased about this at all, but it&#x27;s not worth sending the item back.  I haven&#x27;t used it yet, so I hope it works.  Beware, you&#x27;re only getting one bottle even though the picture shows two.  I&#x27;m giving this product only two stars because the seller was misleading by the picture.</li>
    <li> I used this a couple days ago, because I remembered from years ago that it worked well. My hair felt nice, but my scalp feels like it&#x27;s covered in zits or something. It&#x27;s like a painful rash. I must be allergic to something in this that isn&#x27;t in other shampoos. If I scratch my scalp, it almost looks like I have shimmery, glittery stuff on my scalp, which creeps me out. I don&#x27;t need a glittery, red, bumpy, gross scalp. I&#x27;ll probably throw this away or give it to a friend (and recommend a patch test).</li>
    <li> I love Infusium... especially here in the desert. I have found nothing that does what it does for my hair.</li>
    <li> My 83 year old husband uses this and hair never looked better</li>
    <li> I love this product. My hair was so damaged from highlights, ponytails, the sun... you name it.  I had so much breakage that my hair wouldn&#x27;t grow no matter how often I had it trimmed.  I started using this and within weeks my hair finally grew past my shoulders! So happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Infusium 23 Moisture Replenisher Shampoo, 16 oz  Idelle Labs.  Misleading advertising.  Picture shows 2 items, however, you receive 1 for the price.</li>
    <li> works best for my curse curly hair not greasy and easy to rinse. leaves hair light and shiny. can&#x27;t use anything like Pantene it builds up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years and really like it. It leaves my hair shiny and healthy-looking. I also appreciate the fact is it isn&#x27;t smelly. My allergies do not get along with perfumed toiletries.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying this FREE from Influenster. I was nervous to try it because almost everything makes my hair greasy or oily. I don&#x27;t normally use conditioner due to that fact. I just use shampoo and slowly brush my hair after the shower. This stuff helps me brush out my hair and also really makes it smooth. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy either! My hair is so smooth and soft when I use this. I even decided to try it on my daughter. She always has a huge tangle on the back of her head every morning from sleeping on it so brushing is a chore.When I apply this to her hair after her evening shower, her hair is still smooth and much easier to brush in the morning. We will definitely be buying more.</li>
    <li> They show a picture of two bottles though you only get one. Completely misleading and false advertising. Way overpriced just for 1 bottle. And it was very poorly shipped. Had to return it because the Shampoo had leaked out of the bottle because the top was not securely tightened.</li>
    <li> I used to use this before it was sold to another company and it was the best.  After it was sold the formula changed and now it is one of the worst shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used.  I strips away the moisture in my hair and leaves it feeling like plastic.</li>
    <li> Disappointed to get only 1 bottle when 2 are shown.&lt;br /&gt;I found the same shampoo locally for $5 less than this.</li>
    <li> Great combination for person&#x27;s with dry scalp and flakes. Have been on this brand for ten years or so. So buy hair the treatment with the shampoo for best effect.</li>
    <li> This shampoo really leaves your hair super-soft. After I use it (and the conditioner ) I can&#x27;t stop petting my hair because it&#x27;s so soft and silky (I&#x27;m not exaggerating, I love running my fingers through my hair right after i use it). It also smells fairly nice, it doesn&#x27;t really have any particular strong smell, it&#x27;s just a subtle nice fragrance. The appeal of the shampoo is really the texture it gives to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like to use the moisture replenishing treatment, when my hair gets a bit oily afterwards. It makes your hair very silky smooth as well.</li>
    <li> Good smelling, makes my husbands hair very fluffy...</li>
    <li> do not deal with this company  I have waited three weeks , changed address and they still cannot get it \\&quot;right\\&quot;</li>
    <li> My grandma bought me this shampoo since I have dry hair but it didn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;ve tried it a few times and it always leaves my hair very stringy. It worked for my grandma but definitely not for me. I have fine hair so maybe it&#x27;s not good good for that type.</li>
    <li> Infusium 23 is by far my favorite shampoo/conditioner! It smells great, and makes my hair soft and shiny without weighing it down. I have tried may other shampoo/conditioner combos (I&#x27;m looking at you Aussie, Herbal Essences, and Head &amp; Shoulders), and many of them leave my hair stiff, greasy, and make me have to take another shower. I believe it is because most shampoo/conditioners contain sodium lauryl sulfate, while Infusium contains ammonium laureth sulfate. This difference in ingredients makes a big difference in how it makes my hair look and feel! I will never buy another shampoo/conditioner duo! Customer for life...</li>
    <li> I work 13 hour shifts as a nurse and have curly hair. Not a good combo for smooth hair all day. But I just use this and a bit of hairspray and my hair stays frizz free all day. No sticky gel or mousse needed.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo for like a year. Wasn&#x27;t my favorite it was just cheaper and more convenient than some other similar ones I looked at. If you like this I&#x27;d defiantly try Joico Moisture Recovery. Its AMAZING. I will never go back.</li>
    <li> Love the Infusium products.</li>
