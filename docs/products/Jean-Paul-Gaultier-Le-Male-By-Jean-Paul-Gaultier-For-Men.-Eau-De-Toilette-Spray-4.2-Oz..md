<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Was as stated and contrary to other reviews, the product came professionally packages and had authentic serial numbers and the cologne lasts long.</li>
    <li> I purchase this May 2013. Was lose in can when ship. Also does not last longer the 1 or 2 hours. This is not what you get at macy&#x27;s .&lt;br /&gt;Wasted my money. Will only purchase at macy&#x27;s from now on. At least it will last all day.</li>
    <li> Not the original formulation a lot weaker and more alcoholic notes coming from this cologne. The original has harsh notes of mint and slight lavender and vanilla that comes through but this one has a very strong alcoholic opening at least that&#x27;s the most prominent notes i get you do smell vanilla and mint but its in the background. after about 10-15 minutes the old smell comes back but its weaker not very weak but if you had the original formulation you would notice the difference. Other than that the cologne lasts for a while.. its projection is about 1-2 feet from you and gets close every 4 hour. If you have not had this before its amazing always got complements when wearing this....The good thing about it being weak is that I can wear this to work without choking people out :)</li>
    <li> Not the original. Lasted for less than 2 hours</li>
    <li> Contents were complete, order arrived on schedule as advertised. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I had this back in the 90s and decided to finally re-up. I bought this from amazon so i didn&#x27;t get screwed over like others do buying from resellers of this cologne on here. Smells the same as the old stuff but wears off a little quicker like all colognes do these days to keep you buying more.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this perfume a lot. I bought it for him in France and then on amazon since i can&#x27;t find it in California.</li>
    <li> Great seller. Fast shipping. Very customer driven.  I highly recommend this seller.  My purchase arrived early and saved me over $30.00 off the retail price.  I&#x27;ll buy from them again.</li>
    <li> Great price and always rapid delivery.</li>
    <li> Fabulous repeat buyer I love buying if my boyfriend I love to smell it on him last long it&#x27;s delicious he received many complements.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really rate the scent yet b/c it&#x27;s a Christmas gift however it came in a &#x27;snowglobe&#x27; gift box (not the tin) where you push (2) buttons on either side which blows fake snow around &amp; in the box there&#x27;s also shave balm &amp; body gel.  Obviously a lot different than what&#x27;s pictured but it makes a nice presentation for a gift.  The price listed is $79.</li>
    <li> did not think i would like this fragrance as much as i do. one of my new favorites!</li>
    <li> Ordered on sale at $38.59.  Like another customer, I expected just the Eau de Toilette in a can but got a cardboard gift box including a 1.6oz Gel Douche and a 1.0oz L&#x27;Apres Rasage.  It came in an off white and black striped box which fit in a slide off plastic sleeve open on both sides with a retail price sticker reading $82.00.  Initially, I was a bit put off by the inability to match serial numbers between a can and the bottle, a minor scuff on the bottle as well as a slight tilt in the pump spray top.  I then compared to my existing department store bottle which I discovered also had a slight tilt in the pump spray top. Both tops will rest completely straight with minor adjustment.  All printing, color and embossing appears original.  I would also find it surprising that someone would bother reproducing the bonus items so perfectly in this pack if they were going to do a knock-off.&lt;br /&gt;The most important test is, of course, the smell test.  I had the product and my existing original applied blind to each of my wrists by my wife.  I have been using this scent on a daily basis for over 5 years and I have no doubt that the product I received that was sold and shipped by Amazon is the authentic Gaultier product.  Scents on both my wrists are identical both initially and hours later.&lt;br /&gt;I do not agree with those who say you must always buy such items through a reputable brick and mortar retailer, however, choosing your seller through Amazon and carefully examining the product should go without saying.  I am confident that Amazon would have taken this product back had I found any objections and always could have relied on my credit card company if I had any unresolved issues.&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day I had an awesome savings compared to the retail price.</li>
    <li> Great smelling product</li>
    <li> Thank you!! This perfume came with 2 products more, and I was surprised. I really loved it.</li>
    <li> I and my wife both like this.  smells nice.  But, careful not to put on too much.  the scent stays with you a long time.</li>
    <li> no fragrance remains the origianl perfume before use</li>
    <li> bought this colonge for valentine day. love it.</li>
    <li> Ive been wearing JPG for a lot of years. This is not the same as what I get in the dept store. Even my girl could tell right away after I put a little on. This will be returned. Is it a knock off, or just old? I can&#x27;t say for sure. The first review under &#x27;most helpful customer reviews&#x27; by &#x27;eza&#x27; is exactly my experience.</li>
    <li> Came in the sealed factory box with a body wash as well. What we received is the original product not a knock off and for under 40$ it can&#x27;t be beat. My husband ran out and I was glad to save a bit when getting more.</li>
    <li> I love this smell. The seller is also great, I was surprised to have received the after shave lotion as well! It also came a day early. All characteristics of the bottle are tell tale signs of a genuine purchase. Still smells strong on hour 4. Will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Smell very good!!! Thanks</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t smell like a hot-selling perfume. the $7 fake (polo black) perfume from walmart has a consistent smell. This one started off great. Two sprays were enough. but after a few days even 7 sprays are not enough. Smells more like the after-shave that shipped with it. Amazon is probably not the place to buy perfumes esp if you get free after-shaves.</li>
    <li> Smell&#x27;s great for a young man. I recommend this spray. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it truly is the same department store quality but it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> Great product, good fast shipping. Very happy</li>
    <li> Purchased for a friend as a birthday gift and he loves it.</li>
    <li> Like another reviewer said, we got the holiday gift version. Instead of coming by itself in a can, it came in a fabric covered box with bath gel and after shave cream. Boyfriend was thrilled all the way around, long-time fan of the fragrance, but the fancy gift pack was an unexpected super-bonus!</li>
    <li> I blind-bought the 0.11 oz EDT from the seller Beauty Encounter based on the five-star amazon reviews.  First, the product design is horrible to say the least and seems marketed towards women and gay men... I don&#x27;t need a teal glass male torso statuette sitting in my bathroom.  Second, the product is not sealed so I have no way of knowing if this is the real fragrance or not, especially when there are knockoff varieties out there.    And finally, to the scent itself.  I would personally classify it as a chemical warfare agent and not suitable as a fragrance for anyone.  The smell on my skin is similar to the way I smelled after three hours of swim practice... chlorine.  After the chlorine smell you will get the odor of a waxy vanilla candle and some vague spiciness.  The scent is powerful and unique, but a lot of awful smells are powerful and unique.  The smell isn&#x27;t cheap, but its not dynamic, and its limited smell may become sickening after some period of time.    The only tolerable excuse to wear this scent is if your wife/girlfriend/significant other insists on you wearing it.  And buy a sample before splurging on four ounces of this wretched concoction.</li>
    <li> Quite possibly the best smelling cologne ever. Only other cologne I can imagine that had such a unique smell for a man was CK One. Cool Water was another impact fragrance but with a completely different tone. Le Male can be worn at any time.</li>
    <li> Smells great, came with after shave which I didn&#x27;t even expect.</li>
    <li> Smells great I would buy it again!! Can came unharmed in great condition.</li>
    <li> Unique fresh scent that lasts.  Not overpowering and I  receive positive comments from the opposite sex on this fragrance.</li>
    <li> Awesome! I do recommend!!!</li>
    <li> 100% real. Best fragrance I own...</li>
    <li> This is not original this is fake&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have a old one and the it dont smell the same and the smell only last 1 hour&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So dont buy online and go to the fragrence shop</li>
    <li> Package came ahead of schedule. Product intact. Double the amount of cologne/aftershave expected! Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I really love this scent. It lasts all day. It is my new scent. Will definitely be purchasing again the future.</li>
    <li> smelled fake. i am almost certain these are. for 1/2 the price what can u ask for i guess.&lt;br /&gt;Probably mixed with cheap imitation+water.&lt;br /&gt;Wont buy again any cologne over the interent, too risky.</li>
    <li> I love this one too thank you</li>
    <li> Everyone was raving about this cologne so I had to add it to my collection.  Overall, not impressed.  It lasts longer than some, but isn&#x27;t as amazing as everyone made it out to be.  Same can be said for the projection.  If you take a shower with the stuff, sure...it&#x27;ll project like crazy and last forever.  At the same time, nobody is going to want to be near you as you&#x27;d absolutely wreak.  In normal &amp;#34;dosage&amp;#34; (1-2 sprays in the chest area) it&#x27;ll be OK.  Not something I&#x27;ll order again.</li>
    <li> Good product as expected!</li>
    <li> Definitely the genuine product. The ladies love the scent. im going to buy one more.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this scent. My husband has used it since college and the scent hasn&#x27;t changed.  Very masculine and cool bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne for my husband. Its not very expensive and it lasts a long time. It is not an over powering scent but still smells manly.</li>
    <li> my fav sent.  Comes as described</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is a fake cologne. it doesnt stay as long as the real thing and it smells like theres a lot of alcohol in it... also the markings on the bottle are different from the original one. DO NOT BUY ON HERE.</li>
    <li> this is very sweet cologne and i love it!!!  have used 2 bottles so far in past 3 years!!</li>
    <li> perfect winter smell !</li>
    <li> I live in germany and ordered the same stuff on german amazon and after a half year i figured out that this stuff doesn&#x27;t smell like it should at all anymore. It was like i put water on my shirt. I went to a local store with the bottle and there told me its a fake product!</li>
    <li> wonderful scent for a reasonable price. would make a great valentines gift for the man in your life. lasts a long period of time</li>
    <li> I recommend this to anyone looking to buy original, if you buy it you&#x27;ll regret not making a good investment</li>
    <li> This work&#x60;s awesome thanks !</li>
    <li> I have loved this cologne for at least a dozen years.</li>
    <li> this cologne is great i get compliments on it when i wear it to work my coworkers also ask what i am wearing (not that i tell them). it lasts hours on it. i spray it on while getting ready for work and 8+ hours later i still smell it. the bottle sprays out a good dense cloud of the stuff. it is a great sensual cologne my girl loves it and when i wear it she just keeps smelling me. im not a professional at scents incorporated in colognes but i know it has what i would think of as a good vanilla base with woody undertones and a few more scents in there</li>
    <li> Classic Gaultier. You can never go wrong with Le Male.</li>
    <li> Very good and smells nice</li>
    <li> Without over coming my sense of smell, Jean Paul Gaultier has created a scent that my wife enjoys...</li>
    <li> METAL CAN WAS SMASHED BIG TIME. BOTTLE WAS DAMAGED TOO. PACKAGE WAS NOT DAMAGED AT ALL WHICH LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT THE PERSON THAT PACKED THIS DID IT ON PURPOSE. NO WAY TO MISS THIS DAMAGE!!!!  SHAME ON THE AMAZON SHIPPING DEPT.&lt;br /&gt;THE PRODUCT IS GOOD. NOT QUITE THE SMELL I WAS EXPECTING. SEEMS TO BE MORE OF A FEMALE FRAGRANCE. MAYBE SHOULD HAVE ORDERED THE LE TERRIBLE INSTEAD?</li>
    <li> Absolutely authentic and the scent is divine!</li>
    <li> Genuine product.  Great price.  I got this for $41.  Certainly beats the $90 you&#x27;d otherwise spend at a department store.  Took two weeks to receive, but whatever... it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s possible to have a Gaultier emergency.  Well, maybe for some.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping....works well, so far so good, still too new to know for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: product worked really well, no major complaints!</li>
    <li> Love the stuff and quick shipping</li>
    <li> article of excellent quality</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and was exactly as expected</li>
    <li> I buy this perfume at  maces they have a big different what I understand this is not original one</li>
    <li> The odor of this cologne doesn&#x27;t stay for even good 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> It smells CLEAN like you&#x27;ve just gotten out of the shower, it&#x27;s not over powering.  One spritz is enough, I really love the scent &amp; the price was awesome compared to $90 at a department store.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this cologne!</li>
    <li> Always a great product.  If you never used this yet, try it, you will love it!!!</li>
    <li> Ups lost my package but they still send me another one after two day! They are awsome I&#x27;m very happy with them :)</li>
    <li> Its authentic and you can easily tell it the way packing is done.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon for delivering such a high quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys if you take any perfume the projection will decrease if you are having dry skin .....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of this perfume ....</li>
    <li> JEAN PAUL GAULTIER is a great product with a calm but. confident fragrance. This is actually my third bottle in the last year in a half. Keep up the successful work!!!</li>
    <li> I guess i should have listened to the past reviews this cologne does not last long. The scent is great and not complaining about that, but the cologne will only last for about 2 hours perhaps its not the real thing.. Really regret purchasing this.</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne and much better priced than the mall</li>
    <li> I received an open bottle and I think this is not the original one. I have received Le Male Terrible and the smell is like pachuli.</li>
    <li> This is a great cologne! I bought my husband a bottle after my brother had visited while wearing it. Love it!</li>
    <li> First off, I don&#x27;t know where some reviewers are purchasing their &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; colognes from, but it is NOT from Amazon!! This cologne is legit, 100%!! I am a cologne collector and order many different colognes/fragrances from department stores. I&#x27;ll be honest, I was a little hesitant to purchase a fragrance from Amazon as I didn&#x27;t want to get ripped off with a fake one. I already own a bottle of JPG&#x27;s Le Male, so I would know the difference between a real one and a fake one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was superb. Excellent job wrapping and then re-wrapping my purchase. Once I got to Le Male, the tin was properly sealed as is in department stores. The lettering, everything was on point. More importantly, I sprayed some on and BAM! LE MALE!!!! This is NOT a fake fragrance. I don&#x27;t know where some of you are coming up with that. Keep in mind that I purchased: &amp;#34;Jean Paul Gaultier Le Male FROM, I repeat, FROM Jean Paul Gaultier&amp;#34;, not from a 3rd or 4th party vendor. Also, mind that it says, &amp;#34;Ships from and sold by Amazon.com.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never caught a whiff of JPG&#x27;s Le Male, the small is incredible. The scent duration varies from person to person, but on me, it lasts about 12 hours, easily. I cannot begin to tell you how many compliments I get with this cologne. The hints of warm spicy vanilla drives women wild. Look, I&#x27;m not going to tell you that this cologne will change your life; that&#x27;s your job. However, if you wear some of this stuff, no matter where you go, women will not be afraid to come up to you and say, &amp;#34;you smell so good, what is that?&amp;#34; What you say after that is strictly up to you. On dates, this stuff will seal the deal. Every woman loves Le Male. Some women will even come back to get a second whiff. I cannot kid you guys, even some married women who are walking around with their spouse will come up and compliment. Guys also come up and ask, &amp;#34;hey man, what cologne are you wearing?&amp;#34; As rude as it may sound, I NEVER tell them what it is! I&#x27;ll keep the secret with me. Last thing I want is everyone smelling like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys, if you want a fragrance that is not overpowering, yet extremely aromatic, Le Male is for you. Ladies, if you appreciate your man and you love when he smells good, this would be a great gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re concerned with being a fake, pay attention to who you&#x27;re buying from. Make sure it says FROM Jean Paul Gaultier, AND &amp;#34;Ships from and sold by Amazon.com.&amp;#34; From then on, it&#x27;s nothing but GREAT compliments coming your way.</li>
    <li> The best fragrance for men, very fresh.</li>
    <li> I Have Loved This Men&#x27;s Fragrance Since 1st Smelling It In 2006! Clean, crisp, sexy! I cannot wait to see if my future man loves it and whether it works well with his chemistry!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this on my husband.  Very sexy smell.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s one of my favorite fragrances</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES this brand.  He gets lots of compliments on the way it smells.</li>
    <li> Several years ago this was the cologne I preferred out of many in a store in a mall. I&#x27;ve used this from then on. It was well worth the effort, to me.</li>
    <li> Both my Wife and the Ladies love the scent!</li>
    <li> tested it in the store. had to have it..</li>
    <li> Mine was not authentic, cap had gouge from where it looked like it was pried off.  I have purchased the same cologne from a department store and the fragrance would last all day with only 2 sprays.  I can&#x27;t even smell this one after an hour and I use 4-5 sprays.  The price is tempting, but in my opinion, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this cologne.</li>
    <li> I smelled a sample of this cologne in a magazine and bought it for my husband for an early Christmas gift. The Can it came in was hilarious though we had to open it with a can opener! It smells great and he is very happy with it!</li>
    <li> le male ,the name says it all , i get compliments all the time on this manly smell, i love it</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this fragrance I cant wait to buy its flanker ultra.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years &amp; it is always nice.</li>
    <li> when ever i use this Perfume to office, I have really got the best comment from Ladies, some of them also even was able to ask if this was ean Paul Gaultier Le Male By Jean Paul Gaultier For Men. Eau De Toilette...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this what make this one Unique. I luv this as my all time Faviourate.</li>
    <li> An old favorite that stands the test of time....</li>
    <li> Can had been broken in to. Seal was broken, bottle was loose in box. I fear I got a fake!</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to test this fragrance - loved it - and could not wait to give it as a Christmas gift</li>
    <li> Recommended by son.  Nice and clean smell.  Not overpowering.  Purchased 2 bottles as gifts and the recipients LOVED it.  Good for any age</li>
    <li> Legit. Smells terrific</li>
    <li> If you are going out clubbing, on one of those nice, warm, comfortable nights.....this is the one to put on.  Not only will other people like it....but you will wanna dance with yourself....have fun</li>
    <li> Good fragrance, despite I think is a very effective and masculine fragrance time.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed this seemed like a knock off product compared to department store it seemed weaker and doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
    <li> Great product and delivery.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne! The best!</li>
    <li> Product was delivered with the top either tampered with or damaged. Regardless, I packed it in my suitcase for  a weekend trip and 85% of the bottle leaked out onto my clothes.</li>
    <li> It was a gift that I knew they liked, so they were very pleased. Personally, I&#x27;m not a fan of cologne, men or women, but this was not over-powering or smelled like alcohol. I would definitely recommend this as a gift. You can tell it&#x27;s finer quality, the better perfumes and colognes come from France or Italy.</li>
    <li> While I really enjoy the scent and lasting power of this cologne and  and Amazon&#x27;s Top notch service; unfortunately, I am allergic to this cologne&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning on my way to work, I put on one spray on my chest and half a spray around my neck. After I get to work an hour later, I get an itchy sensation all over my chest where I sprayed it. It could be the musk or some of the other ingredients they use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first allergic reaction I&#x27;ve ever had with a personal care product because I am only allergic to cats (Something you don&#x27;t think is in colognes, but I&#x27;ve read in a few places that Cat Urine is used in some perfumeries, though I highly doubt that they used it in this)</li>
    <li> This  is the first time I ever had a problem with any product I bought from Amazon,  I&#x27;ve been buying stuff for years and never had a problem until now, I use this cologne and always get complements,  but this cologne is weak, it seem to be watered down and it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  I saw reviews of people saying the same thing, I really couldn&#x27;t believe it would have happen to me. I also ordered curve crush and instinct,  unfortunately the same thing.  For anyone who read my review the colognes that I mentioned are excellent they last long and you will definitely get complements, just  don&#x27;t buy them online go to the store and get them.  For those who didn&#x27;t have any problems you are lucky.</li>
    <li> Very weak. I have bought it before and it was way stronger than this. For the price you pay (which is like 30 bucks lower than any department store) you are buying water.</li>
    <li> I was told about this product from a girl who I respect her judgement. The words she used to describe this product were &amp;#34;Hypnotic, amazing, awesome, and mesmerizing&amp;#34;. After trying it I must agree 100%. Even my girlfriend agrees. The first person I hugged after using it gave good reviews with a &amp;#34;Wow, you smell amazing!&amp;#34;. In short the results are astounding. I even catch myself enjoying the scent throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Great price for a product I have always loved. Received in great condition.</li>
    <li> Be careful!  The top of the can the cologne comes in does not detach.  The bottom of the can is the part of the can that gets removed.  I almost broke the brand new bottom opening this can.</li>
    <li> i bought it for my husband. he really love it. long lasting, warm, sweet and suitable for winter. scent of luxury and glamor</li>
    <li> I never get tired of this scent. Everytime I wear it I get compliments. Girls tell me that I smell good, and guys ask me what I&#x27;m wearing. It&#x27;s strong though so 1-2 sprays is enough for the whole day!</li>
    <li> Smells great. Came fast. Smell lingers but not over powerung so you know its real. One or two sprays and you&#x27;re good to go</li>
    <li> I wear it everyday, and everyone always compliments it. It smells so clean and fresh. Soft and powdery, but masculine. It&#x27;s become my signature. I&#x27;ll wear it for the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> Item as described. Came in sealed packaging. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> bought for son. he likes this colonge.</li>
    <li> this is the only brand that i wear, and i love it....everytime i wear it someone compliments the aroma and asks what it is</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to any elegant man. I give it a five star because it&#x27;s no lie, the fragrance last all day.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome for both my sensitive nose and my husband&#x27;s picky taste</li>
    <li> Very good product, my husband is very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> You have met all expectations. the product was on time and i got what i ordered thank you&lt;br /&gt;Bob Snelling</li>
    <li> Not sure if this an authentic item but the sprayer on this stopped working after 1 month of use. Made from very cheap plastic.</li>
    <li> Best there is. Still looking for the runner-up - did not find any. Will be glad to hear from the other &amp;#34;Le Male&amp;#34; fans about their recommendations. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really know what all the hype is about. This cologne is overrated.</li>
    <li> Disappointed very I want my money back</li>
    <li> The fragrence is simply divne, everything is to it&#x27;s expectations, authentic, quality packaging, and an amazing price!</li>
    <li> Not much to add other than what others have already stated. You &amp;#34;WILL&amp;#34; get noticed and sniffed if you put it on. Get asked what it is you are wearing and get told you smell really good - the rest of the game .. it&#x27;s up to you</li>
    <li> Can go wrong for this smell this is probably my favorite cologne of all time it&#x27;s a must bye fellas</li>
    <li> I like so much this perfume</li>
    <li> the product exceeded my expectations</li>
    <li> The fragrance lasts the whole day.....Very fresh, and head turning, smell</li>
    <li> The container seems to be authentic, but the scent is flawed. I compared my Amazon bottle to a bottle at Macy&#x27;s and the scents were completely different. Very disappointed. DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> I have been using Jean Paul Gaultier for years and figured since I am an Amazon shopper would buy it here to save a trip to the store. THIS IS NOT GENUINE  Jean Paul Gaultier! I received what appeared to be the real product but this has a different color, a different scent, and doesn&#x27;t last as long as the original Jean Paul Gaultier . The authentic Jean Paul Gaultier has different writing on the bottle, the color of the liquid and the detail of the lines on the bottle are different, the seal at the top is different, and the of course they smell different. I have filed a dispute with the seller via amazon and requested a refund. I would suggest just going to a high end department store and getting the real thing. If you do get this fake product, I would only say you don&#x27;t know the real thing. Take it to a high end department store and compare. You will see and smell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: seller promptly refunded my money.</li>
    <li> My husband smells good in this! I plan to keep it in stock. That is all I am going to say.</li>
    <li> DONT GET ME WRONG ITS A EXCELLENT SMELL, ONLY THING I WISH WAS FOR IT TO BE MORE LASTING AND ALITTLE LOUDER.</li>
    <li> Love it! Always getting compliments on it.</li>
    <li> True product! Subtle smelling cologne for men!</li>
    <li> All I can say.thank you for the amazing product, it was well packaged and is exactly what I hoped for.</li>
    <li> So glad I bought this while the special was going on, I had ordered this on November 13, 2014 and I was just to assume it was going to be the 4.2 Oz spray but ALSO included was the shower gel and the after shave bottles included in a nice and well packed Christmas themed box with a 2-sided glass plate with snow in it to top it off showcasing all the products. The special deal at the time was also only $37.50 so it was great timing to get such a deal. I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne for 8 years and it&#x27;s my personal favorite, regardless if it was on sale or not, I still would have bought it ;). Its worth the buy!</li>
    <li> The wife loves it so what else there to say????</li>
    <li> Le Male gets a lot of hype and it&#x27;s a common fragrance. I really don&#x27;t like wearing the same cologne so many other men wear but I find myself always coming back to this one and using it anyway. It smells really good and that&#x27;s the bottom line.</li>
    <li> very good purchase, excellent and I came at the agreed time, in perfect condition and I highly recommend it for future purchases</li>
    <li> Got my order just fine and it came with after shave which was a pleasant surprise. Definitely better than dealing with traffic,  parking and high dept store prices.</li>
    <li> Best men&#x27;s cologne for the price!!</li>
    <li> I JUST LOVEEEEE IT!!!! WELL DONE JEAN PAUL GAULTIER!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great scent. This was a terrific buy. And I got the holiday gift version. Instead of coming by itself in a can. It came in a fabric covered box with bath gel and after shave cream.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this on my hubby.....he might get lucky.  We smelled it at Macy&#x27;s and it was $68 so I stepped away and looked it up on Amazon and got it for half the price. When it arrived it also had an after shave bottle that we didn&#x27;t even know we were getting. Score!</li>
    <li> Amazon is AWSOME! Full refund! Very nice and understanding!!! Will always shop with amazon when they treat me like this! How ever This is Fake! When I first sprayed it it smelled like alcohol then moments later it turned to pure vanilla, but the bottle and packaging looked so dam good! So I tool it to Macys and compared them side by side and I could see the different shade of white and the cap on mine was not nice and tight to the bottle, also there where no numbers on the bottle that matched the anything on the container! Not to mention the smell died with in an hour or so, this was purchased from Amazon through a third party by the name of &amp;#34; Red Label OutLet USA&amp;#34; I would not purchase anything from this company!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my bf and can&#x27;t get enough! It smells sooooooo good!! Very sexy smell that even a woman can get away with wearing.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume is the best&lt;br /&gt;good price&lt;br /&gt;arrive at the indicated time&lt;br /&gt;12 hours long lasting fragrance&lt;br /&gt;tanks amazon!!!!</li>
    <li> Will buy as a gift again!</li>
    <li> It is some of the best smelling scent u you will ever smell</li>
    <li> This scent is my absolute favorite. It&#x27;s soft rather than overpowering, and if you read the ingredients, the notes are complex. It&#x27;s an elegant scent...makes me want to cuddle up to whoever is wearing it.</li>
    <li> Came on time and in good condition.  Never smelled it before.  It&#x27;s OK, but not one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> Love the cologne but the cap broke after two weeks and my husband hasn&#x27;t been able to use since. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite masculine scents, you will not be disappointed! I bought this for my husband but I will wear it every now and again :) Arrived in about 10days</li>
    <li> It arrived with the damn cap missing!</li>
    <li> Best Men Perfume ever... Love it</li>
    <li> This stuff smells really good.  Wife loves it (when I use it).  And this price from this seller is great!</li>
    <li> This is not the real cologne! My husband put it on and i could  not even smell it. This fragrance is weak, smell disappears after only a few minute.&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased the real one for at least 15 years and i know the difference. Do not buy this as you will be dissatisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I got alot of compliments on this cologne. I like the way it smells, the girls do and even a few guys complimented me on it.  Its a bit expensive but it lasts a decent amount of time and its amazing.  I&#x27;ll be getting a second bottle soon.</li>
    <li> Limited Edition La Male&#x27;s are Le Males but packaged differently. Sometimes a design other than the white stripe will exist. Sometimes the bottle is accoutred with an armour or a kilt or something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seasonal La Male&#x27;s with slight variations in fragrance exist too - La Male Summer, for instance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I was hoping for one of the above by purchasing this item. What you get instead is La Male, NOT a limited edition La Male. There was nothing Limited Edition about the unit I received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plain and simple. Do not purchase if you&#x27;re hoping to get a Limited Edition La Male.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Amazon has since removed their sales page advertising the Limited Edition version of La Male and have consolidated the comments on that page with the comments over here for the regular La Male.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I will add one more chunk to the stew. It&#x27;s possible Amazon is getting diluted versions of genuine colognes. La Male is a potent loooong-lasting fragrance. The La Male I got from Amazon, Limited Edition or not, doesn&#x27;t last more than 30 minutes and is subtle to start with.</li>
    <li> I bought this cause I was really excited about the good price.  It is DEFINITELY not the real cologne.  It smells exactly like it, it may even be made by the same company, but something went wrong with it at some point, either it stored in some place too hot or cold, because the SCENT DOES NOT LAST.  I&#x27;m telling you, I have bottle that I bought from my local perfume store and it lasts a good 5 hours or so.  This scent from this online bottle is gone within in an hour.  This is also not a lone case.  I also bought a calvin klein cologne on amazon and had the exact same issue.  I would not again be swayed by the good prices and simply pay the 20% more at my local store for the real thing.  If you buy it here and notice the scent doesn&#x27;t last, you&#x27;ll know why</li>
    <li> I have gotten good compliments on this cologne. I am often asked by people I work with &amp;#34;What are you wearing? It smells really good.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Broken Bottle leaked when opened can.I love Jean Paul Gaultiers spray and will buy again but at a local store</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite scents to wear any time of the day. I find it fresh, clean, inviting and mellow as the day goes on. You will find that this cologne lasts all day which is another reason why I absolutely recommend and love it. If your looking for a clean, sophisticated manly man scent, then Le Male is the one for you.</li>
    <li> Nice parfum I always like it</li>
    <li> Excellent product will recommend a wonderful perfume and Venezuela came quite soon ..</li>
    <li> Smells just like I remember.</li>
    <li> I just love Amazon this website is so awesome, my husband love this Jean Paul Gaultier. The order is always on time and the quality of the item is good. Amazon is the first item on my list for Christmas</li>
    <li> I bought this item from Amazon to replace a bottle that I&#x27;d gotten from Macy&#x27;s several years prior.  This bottle from Amazon smells much weaker and not as nice.  This used to be my favorite scent but after wearing the suspected fake from Amazon I can hardly stand it any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to throw this new bottle away and take this as a lesson: Don&#x27;t buy fragrances from the Internet just to save a few bucks.  You&#x27;re much better off going to a reputable retailer and getting the real deal.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cologne as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend.  He works in an professional office and therefore cannot wear any offending heavy scents that is the reason why I got him this. The scent is very sophisticated and smells so sexy.  I even spray it on myself now again just to think of him.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth the price. You can look like s*** but when you smell like MANLINESS you will not mind your disposition.....</li>
    <li> Very happy with my order!</li>
    <li> Bought it in a store. It&#x27;s JUST ok! Not as classy/fanciful as the raves suggest. Doesn&#x27;t pull off the hype, smells like baby powder sorry.</li>
    <li> I like is good I will buy again. thanks</li>
    <li> I really am not sure about all of these 1-3 star peoples problem is with this item saying it isn&#x27;t the real authentic cologne. I have to say to those people you must of had gotten it from a bad seller or maybe just had bad luck with yours, because the one from I got it from which is SAI HOLDINGS WW INC the 2 day prime shipping,  is the real deal &amp; if not they make it smell and last like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do I know?  I use to pay $95 dollars at Macy&#x27;s for the same stuff I could of been getting here $55 cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very close to of not bought this from here due to all of the 1-3 star peoples saying it doesn&#x27;t last long and it doesn&#x27;t smell the same but I took the shot in the dark,  and am happy I didn&#x27;t miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cologne is liquid sex girls will die over at but you&#x27;ll love the smell of it too. So,  don&#x27;t let the price fool you in thinking highers better because it isn&#x27;t take a shot and try it out for yourself.</li>
    <li> Still one of the best!  At a price you can&#x27;t beat.  Almost 30 dollars less than Macy&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> Just ok. I think it&#x27;s the real deal but who knows. It&#x27;s strong so it will last a while.</li>
    <li> The actuall cologne is great, what I had a problem with was I was giving this as a gift, and they had packaged it in an oversized box so it must have been shifting around in transit, so when I recieved the cologne it had come open. The plastic wrap had torn, so now it looks like I am giving an open gift? Not happy. This stuff is not cheap, so it&#x27;s not like I can just buy a new one</li>
    <li> excellent perfume, strong and masculine scent, size larger than normal, the embajale was careful and appropriate for the product. thanks</li>
    <li> I have been reading alot about fake Le Male perfumes here. I own one from Macy&#x27;s and I also bought this one. This seems to be the same (authentic), the packaging was great, with sealed plastic around the metal box and the stamps under the bottle. Same description text and paint on the bottle as the previous one I have. The smell is the same and after 5 hours now, still remains strong.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Thought it was only the bottle alone but came in a gift set so definitely worth the money! thanks!</li>
    <li> Best scent I ever purchased.  Others notice and only positive comments.</li>
    <li> Top broke off within a few months.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing smell for any occasion. It&#x27;s a relaxing  and original scent that will have people asking you what are you wearing.</li>
    <li> This is a very good smelling cologne and I love when my husband wears it. It is one of the best men&#x27;s fragrance there is.</li>
    <li> my husband love this perfume, he ask me to order him 2 more and he just used that bottle. I find that funny but he said the smell stays all day on him.</li>
    <li> Showed up quickly and as expected. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love the scent. A friend was wearing it and I fell in love with it. Very happy with the fragrance</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it. It last all day.</li>
    <li> I found the scent to be fresh and summery. Love it during the winter.</li>
    <li> I like this Perfume is great, I feel in the paradise, This perfume you feeling fresh any time, is so good.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is very subtle and yet very classy. I use it during the day and even use it in my car through the cabin filter. Lasts about 4-5 hours.</li>
    <li> Bought From KaufmanFragrance and it is indeed legit. Smells great and unique. That is all and have a nice day.</li>
    <li> One day I was at the mall with my ex at our local mall, we walked into Dillard&#x27;s and I was going to buy her a perfume of her choice, as she was choosing one, I walked to the mens section, and saw this unique looking bottle, I have never heard of it, or scene it before (this was in 2010) and I asked the lady if there was another sample because the one they had on display was empty (right there I knew this had to be good stuff) so she got a fresh sample version of it, and I sprayed it on my skin right on my left wrist and all I could say was &amp;#34;WOW!&amp;#34; and she just chuckled. I immediately bought the bottle for almost $100 at a store like that. Come to find out Amazon has it for half the price! Well I walked out of the store, just still with that one spray on my wrist, and I got 4 compliments that day just in the mall itself. Guys this is some seriously good stuff! Get it! I woke up the next day at around 11am and the scent was still there and if I recall I had sprayed it at around 2pm. So this stuff has the best longevity I have scene on a cologne yet!</li>
    <li> After reading reviews on how great this fragrance is i decided to try it out myself but when i first tried it smelled too harsh and like medicine. Ill stick with creed.</li>
    <li> Truly great product. Fragrance is mild and elegant. My wife and children love it. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am not inclined to write product reviews. However, this product is a FAKE and no way compares to the Authentic &amp;#34;Le Male&amp;#34; by Jean Paul Gaultier. The people rating this product with 5 stars obviously have never purchased the product from a reputable department store. Those that rated 1 star have got it all correct. I have been purchasing/wearing this fragrance for over 2 years and know it well. This product doesn&#x27;t come close to the authentic fragrance. At best, the cologne lasts no more than a few hours. When I wear the authentic version, applied in the morning, I am still receiving compliments about how wonderful it smells late in the evening. I thought it strange that this product could be purchased at such a discounted rate, but now I know why. If you want to enjoy this great smelling fragrance - buy it at a reputable department store.  I will cost much more but worth every penny.  This product has got to be rejected by the reputable stores.  SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!</li>
    <li> It is not an original, but at this price, I&#x27;m satisfied with it :)</li>
    <li> Great seller and great products!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Smells great.</li>
    <li> I spent like an hour to see if this was the real thing. Mostly everything checked out except there wasn&#x27;t a product number on the lid of the tin. Which raised concern for me, I also noticed the smell doesn&#x27;t stay strong. Overall I love JPG and it smells great nevertheless.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my dad and he loves it.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this on my husband. Great packaging. Delivered on time great price.Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I met the man of my dreams 14 yrs ago wearing this.  He is to NEVER run out!</li>
    <li> Not the real deal, too good to be true</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend for Christmas, and it was FANTASTIC! The package delivered in time, before Christmas. The deal I got on it was remarkable for the size (largest size, and paid $45 for it). The scent lasts a long time. My boyfriend will put it on first thing in the morning, and when we meet up for lunch, it&#x27;ll still be smelling good on him. If you&#x27;re looking for a great quality cologne, I would say to go with this, for sure!</li>
    <li> after finally receiving it I was happy with this cologne, has a nice scent. I would definitely buy it again</li>
    <li> it is what i expected ....excellent fragrance ! will purchase again when i need it !!</li>
    <li> Same item in department stores but a better price.</li>
    <li> My husband loves cologne. This is one of his favorites.  I have no regrets with this purchase. Now I know where to make my cologne purchases</li>
    <li> Hello, first of all, I OWN THIS PERFUME, so you probably should read carefully, this item sold by Amazon and i&#x27;m not claiming its fake but from what i read on big fragrance website this is #1 perfume for men, YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTMENT if you but it from here, i got the biggest size because i believed in the reviewers and i really didn&#x27;t like it, it doesn&#x27;t project at all, the notes is just horrible, last for like only 30 minutes....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not sure if they changed the formula or it is fake so please save your money or buy different perfume or buy it from local store after you try it.</li>
    <li> I have bought this item a couple times and will probably keep buying it because my husband can&#x27;t get enough of it. I think the scent is nice too!</li>
    <li> I read some reviews from others that felt negatively about buying fragrances online. I decided to risk it and am very pleased with my purchase. The scent stays all day and I cannot get enough of it on my man! I bought this as a Christmas present, and will have to remember this vendor as I intend to search for a few other fragrances that I want.</li>
    <li> I got this cologne for my husband, he really like it</li>
    <li> This is the original product. I absolutely love it. Shipment was quick and easy. Smells great and classy. i would recommend it to everyone</li>
    <li> Smells amazing boyfriend loves it</li>
    <li> The best. I love this on my husband</li>
    <li> Unbeatable price FAST!</li>
    <li> I recently bought this for my husband for upcoming Father&#x27;s Day, however, after reading reviews I was a bit apprehensive, I didn&#x27;t want to give my husband a knock off because he wears the best, so he will definitely knows the difference and I will be quite embarrass to say the least. Anyway, I decided to check product out for its authenticity and hmmm- wow a total knock off. The cologne at first was very strong but within an hour faded, also the bottom of bottle had writing that was lean and lap-sided, also it had a fake stamp or writing that totally rubs off onto my palm, literally I had whitish silver sparkle all over my hand. The sprayer nozzle attached to mouth of bottle had no serial number and was raised a bit, this seriously could cut your finger and same thing for can item came in. Be fore warned, this was a total knock off, I was veeerry disappointed. I gave a star only for quick shipment and I bought item from Amazon, not third party.</li>
    <li> who doesn&#x27;t know that this is a great smelling Cologne . I mean you wouldn&#x27;t even need to sample it it&#x27;s a great name by itself is been in magazines this one of the top 10 greatest smelling Cologne sold. do yourself a favor if you haven&#x27;t already have this in your collection add it sweet smelling,  I will have to say on an everyday basis it&#x27;s always getting complement you can never go wrong with will recommenhis seller continue to buy</li>
    <li> Great deal! Very happy!!</li>
    <li> i have been cheated on and thats not cool&lt;br /&gt;i would like my money back or i will report it&lt;br /&gt;the product is not orginal is a fake item&lt;br /&gt;this is not cool , i am not happy at all i have spent that amount of money on fake Jean paul gaultier&lt;br /&gt; please can i have my money back or i will report</li>
    <li> Always smells great...</li>
    <li> OMG! The smell is just so sexy! Loved it!</li>
    <li> I went to a place that sells colognes an found it, was glad they had it cause this cologne stayed on my mind for the longest. This is worth buyin you will love it.</li>
    <li> Classic . This and Armani are the only too fragrances my husband has worn for the last two years. Never gets old. However, I too think it is a knock off: the bottle is not the same</li>
    <li> The perfume does not smell as the original one, i am dissapointed with this product.</li>
    <li> I recently received the fragrance in Venezuela, and I really think we need to improve the production of this perfume. Taking into consideration that it is a Eau de Toilette, I still think that the fragrance is quickly lost. No remains in the body. It is comparable with the perfume itself. And, despite coming sealed plastic container, one of the two packages, wine with 20% less than the other, which is certainly a mistake filling, which has had properly inspect the quality control department .</li>
    <li> Probably the most obnoxious and overbearing fragrance I&#x27;ve ever experienced.  Plus I developed a headache within seconds of putting this stuff on.  I definitely shouldn&#x27;t have bought this one based on all the great reviews here.  I couldn&#x27;t wash it off quickly enough.  Wearing this will get people&#x27;s attention alright, but perhaps not the type of attention you desire.  Definitely try this out in the store somewhere before you purchase.</li>
    <li> Came on time and my fiance loved it!</li>
    <li> Fast and great product</li>
    <li> Great, clean smelling eau de toilette for me.  Not overpowering, but just a subtle clean smell</li>
    <li> Great smelling juice. Vanilla,mint slightly powdery. wewe.Be careful from who you order from and do you counterfeit reseach before purchasing.</li>
    <li> All the women I&#x27;ve been around absolutely love it. I got a lot of great compliments. Definitely a attention getter.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my rugged Man&#x27;s Man kinda guy hoping he&#x27;d like it even though it has layers of vanilla, menthe and bergamot. He does! It smells great and is a great gift for that guy who also has multiple layers and intrigue just like the scent. The bottle is so aesthetic, too.</li>
    <li> This cologne is recommended to anyone that loves to smell a Manly smell on their mate.  Price was great as well.</li>
    <li> Ive been buying this perfume for 10+ years, I just keep coming back to it as its a classic, great fragrance</li>
    <li> Most amazing smell ever.</li>
    <li> 100% original, recomendado para todas loa ocasiones. Todo a tiempo sin inconvenientes. Vendedor 100 % responsable&lt;br /&gt;me llego el producto a tiempo</li>

    <li> My Husband wears this and it smells great I just purchased it for my 95 year old uncle. Great man the still drives sings in his church choir and cleans up very nice.</li>
    <li> One of the best smelling colognes available.</li>
    <li> Brought it for my grandson, he loves it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about this cologne, but it makes me nuts( in a good way). I can&#x27;t get enough of my man when he wears this. Its a great present for any man</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite male fragrance. Great deal, fair price, fast shipping, very satisfied.</li>
    <li> better than expected!!! I looooove the scent!</li>
    <li> One of the most head turning fragrances ever, Women notice this one.</li>
    <li> This is my son&#x27;s favorite.</li>
    <li> I wore this fragrance and everyone likes it! they say it smells beautiful,heavenly,. when I put this fragrance on , my wife goes crazy for it she says \\&quot;it smells delightful\\&quot; I recommend this for every one it is a great product</li>
    <li> Smells ok not, really my style but its different and worth the money. Curve, Realm and Fahrenheit are my favorites.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast, safe shipping. Very pleased overall..............Tommy Loreto</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. This company included the aftershave and shower gel, which was unexpected but wonderful.</li>
    <li> best price on this cologne anywhere. legit</li>
    <li> Le male is great for someone younger (under 30) and who likes to go out. The product came exactly as described and on-time, so no complaints. Le male has great projection, sillage, and longevity (noticeable for 4 hours, then sits on skin for another 6 hours). I bought 4.2 oz for under $50, which is a great deal (probably won&#x27;t find a better deal anywhere else).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 4/5 because the cologne is starting to give me headaches. At first, I really liked it, but now I&#x27;m starting to get worn down by it (maybe too much vanilla, too gourmand). Nevertheless, I still get complements all the time.</li>
    <li> Great scent. I got many compliments.</li>
    <li> Seems to be the real thing and the scent lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Thank you very much for the prompt service I am very much satisfied</li>
    <li> Good price for great fragrance.</li>
    <li> The best smell for me!</li>
    <li> My son suggested the Jean Paul fragrance and he was right. Its light and clean and not overpowering...good choice!</li>
    <li> I bought 5 musks and this is the only one that has made it into the (bottom) of my rotation.  Smells like English leather, but a little more complex.  As a bonus, they also sent me a bottle of aftershave which smells great as far as aftershaves go -- but I don&#x27;t really wear aftershave because I am more interested in my colognes.  If I was an aftershave guy, I would love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a frequent shopper on Amazon, with mostly positive experiences.  I bought this cologne for my son.  When it arrived, before it was even opened, a strong scent was emanating from the sealed package which wasn&#x27;t pleasant.  It was like being in an elevator with someone who wore cheap perfume.  When my son finally opened the package and wore the cologne, he found that the scent lasted for maybe an hour or less.  It was worthless and he threw it away.  The women&#x27;s version, which I purchased for my daughter-in-law, was authentic.  Save your money and don&#x27;t purchase the men&#x27;s version on Amazon.</li>
    <li> 1 spray from 1 foot away. i constantly and consistently get compliments on this. it smells sweet-ish and vanilla-y.</li>
    <li> Very nice product thanks.</li>
