      <li>It&#x27;s a great price for a product that works really well.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this shampoo.</li>

      <li>I purchased this shampoo looking for a gentle option to wash my hair daily and what a great idea!  </li>
      <li>My super-fine 3b curly hair absolutely loves this stuff!!!  </li>
      <li>so it feels very economical too.  </li>
      <li>If I skip a day of washing feels like my hair hasn&#x27;t gotten clean after one lather is I&#x27;ll do it twice</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite smell, but it&#x27;s pretty clean and not bad.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> While I can&#x27;t attest to this product&#x27;s curly hair benefits, I STRONGLY recommend it for color-treated hair maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always on the lookout for quality, sulfate-free shampoos for my short, straight, often color-processed hair; finding and LOVING this shampoo was a happy accident. A small amount goes a long way, giving you rich, sulfate-free lather, thoroughly clean hair and prolonged color. This is the ONLY S-F shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried where only a *faint* hint of color appears on lather—THAT makes me happy! Subtle coconut scent is a lovely bonus. The conditioner is a great, moisturizing match, too, leaving hair shiny. My sulfate-free shampoo search is over!</li>
    <li> My hair is very curly and the product keeps my curl and gives more volume to my hair...I recommend it to curly hair</li>
    <li> I use the L&#x27;Oreal EverCurl shampoo and conditioner.  Love them both, and they have no sulfates.  Leave my hair clean and manageable with just a small amount of product.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, great product!</li>
    <li> first off, love the smell,delicate but nice...I wear expensive perfumes every day and this rather complements the perfume not overshadowing it.I am very lucky at 66 to have beautiful long thick hair,never colored and it does as I wish so this shampoo for curly hair makes it super soft with well defined spiral like curls.just ordered the conditioner we shall see what the combination is like.</li>
    <li> BEST SHAMPOO I HAVE EVERY USED. I HAVE SUPER CURLY HAIR AND THIS PRODUCT HAS REALLY TRANSFORMED MY CURLS AND HAS HELPED DRASTICALLY WITH THE FRIZZ.</li>
    <li> Again the Loreal team hit the ball right out of the bueaty palor with this line with one problem.  I&#x27;m a 3 shampoo girl. .The size of this tube makes me have to purchase 3 shampoos and 3 conditioners per month or suffer someone going with unclean hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look finally Loreal has created something that my 15 year old and I both absolutely love. We love the scent, the way our hair cooperate more easily. Very manageable now.  I am planning on setting up a subscription to this particular line</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo.  And it&#x27;s Sulfate Free!</li>
    <li> This shampoo has changed my life! I bought this from walmart, not amazon, and I am so in love. I have shoulder length curly thick crazy hair, and i always have to use my Catwalk curl cream because my hair is a frizz ball with no definition if i don&#x27;t. This shampoo is a miracle! First off, it smells amazing ! I completely love the smell! Secondly, my curls have definition with zero product in them ! Girls with the curls, this stuff is my new holy grail!</li>
    <li> It smells amazing, my hair feels soft but still a bit frizzy. I will definitely be buying this shampoo again,</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo for fine hair.  It doesn&#x27;t suds up a lot but you need to use very little to get your hair really clean.  I like that I&#x27;m not harming my hair as well as the environment.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with another reviewer that this was a huge disappointment. First, let me say that the lather is great, really great. Lots and lots of very soft lather that is a nice experience in the shower. That&#x27;s all that&#x27;s good about it, though. First, there&#x27;s the smell. A very odd smell. Sort of reminds me the smell left on your hands when you pull up weeds in the yard: not horrible, but herbal in a not-nice way. Then there&#x27;s what it does to my long, wavy/frizzy hair: it takes all the wave OUT and gives me even MORE frizz. After using the shampoo (and the matching condition, btw), my hair was left poker-straight but with a layer of frizz in uneven patches over my hair. It looked really, REALLY bad. It looked like I have super-damaged hair (I do not). The texture of my hair was soft, but it looked so awful I didn&#x27;t really care about the texture. I tried all sorts of additional styling products for the three times I used this stuff but nothing made my hair right again until I went back to my regular shampoo (Amika). I really have to say -- and I&#x27;ve left this comment on other shampoos, too -- this no-sulfate kick that manufacturers are on is JOKE. I have yet to find a sulfate-free shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking like crap, or smelling awful, or is completely useless in terms of cleaning. I&#x27;m DONE with them. This EverCurl stuff was set to be the exception -- I liked the lather -- but I ended up disappointed once again with the what it did to my hair. I cannot recommend this stuff.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo. I have wavy to curly hair that frizzes very easily, and this keeps my curls bounces and keeps the frizz away. People are always commenting on how nice and soft my hair looks ever since I switched to this.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal EverCurl Hydracharge Shampoo and Conditioner work as well on my mid-back-length loose corkscrew curls as the Paul Mitchell Curl Shampoo and Leave-in Conditioner at cleaning, conditioning, hydrating, detangling, and frizz reduction. Not only is the price about a third as much as the salon version, I use a quarter-size amount of shampoo for a much better lather than a palm-full of the Paul Mitchell shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to both the shampoo and the conditioner (and the only major differences I have found to the Paul Mitchell Curls line) are the fragrances of the L&#x27;Oreal versions - they are not good. The shampoo has an almost ferret-like sickly sweet smell, and the conditioner is musky. Though my hair usually retains fragrances, these two do not seem to last over the styling cream I put in post-shower, so I will continue to order them, though I hope L&#x27;Oreal might change fragrances sometime soon.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner have been my favorite ever compared to every salon curling s&amp;c!!! It works for months of continuous use without the need for switching to others.  My super-fine 3b curly hair absolutely loves this stuff!!!  My hair does not need to be trimmed as often, due to fewer breakages and fewer split ends.  Great when you are growing your hair out or wanting more defined, no-friz curls.  I&#x27;ll use only these products as long as they continue to make it.</li>
    <li> The  shampoo and conditioner aren&#x27;t horrible, but did nothing for the curl or body of my hair. I don&#x27;t even remember the fragrance, so it seems not to have bothered me. Perhaps someone with extremely curly or corse hair would like it better, mine is fine and frizzy.</li>
    <li> I have 4B-C hair and I love this shampoo.  It&#x27;s inexpensive and it moisturizes very well.  I do wish that it came in a bigger size but that is okay.  The shampoo also has a very nice floral scent.  I&#x27;m just really glad that I could find a moisturizing sulfate-free shampoo that doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg and that is available in grocery stores and pharmacies everywhere.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo for curly hair I&#x27;ve found and a great price.  It&#x27;s a win, win.  Love this product line for my very curly hair. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found.  Make hair soft, but not limp.</li>
    <li> The product itself is fine...the problem is the lovely turquoise container both the shampoo and conditioner come in.  The paint, or whatever is used for the cover, comes off  when it gets wet...and it is certainly going to get wet when you shampoo and condition your hair, especially in the shower.  The flakes of turquoise ended up in my hair and was a real mess.  I contacted the company three times and suggested they find a different type of paint for the tubes and they didn&#x27;t even give me the courtesy of a reply.</li>
    <li> Have the conditioner as well. Love these products. They smell great and make my hair feel healthy. My bottles are empty and I am re-ordering them.</li>
    <li> I live in the caribbean, and the weather here is unpredictable to say the least!! I purchased this shampoo looking for a gentle option to wash my hair daily and what a great idea!  I also use the curl cream afterwards and I cannot tell you what an amazing difference this has made. My hair is soft, frizz free and I use a very small amount of product. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> My hair thinks this stuff is magic! I have just slightly wavy but fine hair and it gets frizzy easily. This helps make it super soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> OK, so I forgot about the tiny amount of liquid that may go on an airplane. The lady who took it was very nice, but she still tool my shampoo. New Orleans was fun, even with dirty hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for months on my thin &amp; curly hair. Strange combo I know...&lt;br /&gt;I use the complementary conditioner as well.&lt;br /&gt;Works great and doesn&#x27;t way down my hair at all - which is a nice change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d suggest using this with a cleansing shampoo once a week if you use any product though. I&#x27;ve noticed if I&#x27;ve done my hair it wont remove all the residue. I&#x27;m talking mouse, hair spray, texture creme etc... It takes a lot to make a thin, curly mane do what I want :)</li>
    <li> cant say enough about it, really works i have tried so many and this is the bomb.</li>
    <li> More cons than pros with this shampoo. My scalp itches constantly, never had this problem when I used Nexxus split end remedy shampoo, I was trying to save money and bought the evercurl shampoo.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful sulfate free shampoo for those of us with curly hair. It helps keep the curls instead of tangles.</li>
    <li> the product is amazing. Its a very creamy and gentle shampoo. Unfortunately mine was shipped and not packed very well and exploded in the box because the seam broke. I still have yet to find a way to really salvage my shampoo but i love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of sulfate free shampoos especially this one. I love the smell. It does wonders for my thick frizzy hair. I also recommend the leave in conditioner as well as the gel. The only thing is if you have longer thicker hair you will have to use just a bit more then the recommended amount for the gel. Other than that no complaints. I love it!!</li>
    <li> My hair likes it- but only every other day... so I rotate between this and another hair shampoo/conditioner</li>
    <li> I had my hair completely dry, and I was looking for the right shampoo/conditioner until I found this sulfate free baby. I&#x27;ve used it for a few days and I gotta say the results have been remarkable. Completely remarkable. Also, it creates a fair amount of lather and the sensation is quite enjoyable. I fully recommend this if your hair is fragile and dry, I mean it REALLY HELPS. At least that&#x27;s the result I got in my experience!</li>
    <li> Smells good. Nice thick lather, does not strip my hair, leaves it very soft.</li>
    <li> I love that I can get a product that is comparable to Bumble &amp; Bumble at about 1/3 the price..... But... I probably use about twice as much of it. That being said, I DO have very long (waist length and I am 5&#x27;11&amp;#34;) and thick wavy hair. Either way, I love the results and the price tag and have purchased it multiple times :)</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy hair and I have always had trouble finding shampoo with no sulphates that doesn&#x27;t completely leave my hair all frizzy. This stuff seems to work pretty well with both the shampoo and conditioner. My only grievance is that the smell isn&#x27;t all that great-smells kind of baby powdery to me, but I shall continue to use it because it works well. Everyone&#x27;s hair is different but this system is def worth a try !</li>
    <li> It works on my wavy hair and helps control frizz</li>
    <li> love the way it has makes my curls look nice!</li>
    <li> I love this line from loreal.  I&#x27;m excited to purchase more from it.  I have long curls and sometimes they can be just a pain to care for.  This shampoo helps keep the moisture in my hair without looking oily or greasy.  The shampoo works up to a thick, luxurious lather, which I really love.  It&#x27;s a great price for a product that works really well.  Will definitely purchase again, and would recommend this to anyone with curly hair.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for afro hair and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of product in order to clean your head because is very concentrated.</li>
    <li> Great for frizzy hair</li>
    <li> I have thick, blonde, and wavy hair. It&#x27;s usually pretty dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to use natural products when I can, and this appealed to me because it is sulfate-free. If I use a product intended for straight hair, my hair often becomes tangly and out-of balance. This product, however, gave my curls a little bit of bounce while keeping them hydrated. Two or three times a week, I shampoo with this before I go to bed. I wake up with soft, manageable waves. Success!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus: This stuff smells SO good.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Nothing bad for your locks in this shampoo.  Doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out like most shampoos.</li>
    <li> Left my hair flat and over conditioned to the point where it didn&#x27;t much curl.... sad. It has no fragrance at all.</li>
    <li> For the price this sulphate shampoo is so worth it, it feels glorious in the shower and it works well to make gloomy hair look a bit healthier ;)</li>
    <li> Soft, shiny hair!  I waited weeks to post this.  A hairdresser mentioned that shampoo and conditioner really matters.  Hair prone to frizz needs this kind of shampoo and conditioner and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  A little goes a long way so it feels very economical too.  My hair is so tamed I&#x27;m considering letting it grow long.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the best I have ever used! It is creamy and lathers up really good and leaves your hair soft and shiny. I love it! Seriously!!!</li>
    <li> Love it!  This whole line of products is great for my hair which is thick, coarse, curly hair. I have tried many more expensive products but this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> Used for two years and still love it.</li>
    <li> Bottle lasted about a month. I have dry, fine, thick wavy hair. I found this product dried out my hair.  The product did however help better define my curls but it also did add weight to my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine, but really wavy. It has gotten downright frizzy in the last few years, too. Anyway, this product along with the conditioner, has totally changed my hair game. It is way more manageable, silky, and has a nice wave to it while still feeling light and bouncy. I&#x27;m a total convert. Also it&#x27;s sulfate-free, and sulfates are a big no-no for your hair, especially if it&#x27;s colored. And the price is right! Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> Terrible smell, but I like the conditioner as it is. Just have to put some other hair products in to mask the chemical smell. Why does it smell like chemicals if it&#x27;s suppose to be free of most of those things that are bad for your hair.</li>
    <li> It was shipped really fast and on time. I like this product because is 100% vegan, doesn&#x27;t have parabens, sulfates or silicones. I recommend to anyone who is starting lo/no poo. I am reviewing right now the shipping and the product itself. I didn&#x27;t start to use yet, but as soon as I use I&#x27;ll post another review about the effect on my hair.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really know how bad this shampoo was until I stopped using it. I originally purchased it when I was on a sulfate-free shampoo kick and loved it because it smelled delicious and lathered so much better than many other sulfate-free shampoos I had tried. I noticed after using it for a while that my hair felt almost sticky (for lack of a better word) while I was blowdrying and took forever to dry. My hair was poofy and the texture was all wrong. I tried many expensive products in an attempt to make it softer and dry quicker before finally switching to the Loreal Total Repair 5 shampoo. I cannot believe the difference in my hair after one shampoo. It is soft, no frizz, dries in half the time, and feels so clean. I am even getting new hair growth around my hairline. Wish I had switched off this shampoo a long time ago!!</li>
    <li> Smells good. Cleaned my hair.</li>
    <li> Great product, I am loving the positive effects of sulfate free! I have medium thickness, long length curls and have damaged from over-dyeing at home. We live in a VERY&lt;br /&gt;DRY climate and this has done wonders for me. I use henna on my hair now, in connection with this shampoo and this helps to my red hair stay red for much longer between coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again. OH..and it works for my daughters, husband (he has psoriasis and it helps) and for me! Now I&#x27;ll be getting the conditioner as well!</li>
    <li> As my hair turned silver, it also developed curls.  I was baffled about how the manage curly hair, but the L&#x27;Oreal EverCurl has completely solved the puzzle.  The shampoo, rinse and leave in conditioner have given me soft, shiny, wavy hair.  I am so pleased with the results, and won&#x27;t use anything else.  Just follow the directions.</li>
    <li> Granted, I&#x27;ve only used this one, but let me say this: thus far it&#x27;s a HUGE disappointment!!!!  My wavy/curly hair is lifeless, limp, frizzy, and dry.  It has no shine, and very limp waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s downright silly that this is marketed to curly girls as moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were varied reviews on the smell.  It is a perfume-like smell, but I do not find it strong or offensive.  It&#x27;s not my favorite smell, but it&#x27;s pretty clean and not bad.  (Do note, of course, that I am accustomed to Nexxus products that are definitely scented.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous shampoo choices were Nexxus Weightless and Joico KPak.  I recommend either (the Kpak is more moisturizing, but I think the Nexxus is excellent for allow your hair to bounce).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use this product a few more times and update if there is any change in my impression.  I think I&#x27;ll be giving this away.  Would LOVE your best recommendations for curly girl products that work!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see the the full results until about 14 days, but I have cut down on use of all the other products I used to have to put in my hair! If I skip a day of washing feels like my hair hasn&#x27;t gotten clean after one lather is I&#x27;ll do it twice and it does the trick. That&#x27;s the only con. I think that&#x27;s why you don&#x27;t have to use as much product because it uses the natural oil in you hair. I also have the conditioner which I like as well.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo, it seems to extend the life of my hair color.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo. Sulfate-Free, Paraben-Free and Vegan. Cleans just as good as my Pureology did and costs 1/5 of the price per 8 oz bottle.</li>
    <li> My hair is curly in humidity and wavy in the winter. This shampoo is perfect for my hair type and better than the expensive salon shampoos I have tried. It does not dry out or flatten my hair. Nor does my hair feel like it has a coating on it.</li>
    <li> This is a good shampoo! I tried it because I wear my relaxed hair curly.  Because my hair is very dry, tangles very easily, and is prone to frizz I decided to try this system which promised to be non-drying and anti-frizz.  I liked the fact that is sulfate free.  It did do what it promised my hair was frizz free and soft after it air dried.  I just wish this was a detangling shampoo.  My hair felt kind of tight after I washed it. That&#x27;s why I did not give it the full 5 stars.  After I used the Ever Curl conditioner and the Ever Curl leave in conditioner spray my hair was fine. My hair had a nice slip while I was styling my hair.</li>
    <li> It is inexpensive but works really well!</li>
    <li> Best conditioner that I have used in a long while my hair is fine with natural curl and too much hair color and processing have dried it out and the conditioner brought my curls back to life my hair feels clean but moisturized love it definitely will buy more</li>
    <li> I have somewhat coarse curly hair and while this did make my hair soft, it did nothing for the curls.</li>
    <li> I do like the shampoo for my curly hair, really makes my hair soft &amp; manageable but I will not buy again until they change the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The coloring crumbled off the bottle everytime I squeezed the tube. It made a mess in my shower and in my hands.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair nice and waive. Unlike other shampoos this product doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy. Love the product and the price.</li>
    <li> No different from Garnier Fructis or any other household cheap brand - did not significantly or otherwise insignificantly revitalize my hair.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and this leaves it frizz free and soft.  Great formula!</li>
    <li> I was looking to get a new shampoo &amp; conditioner for my newly permed hair and it causes me massive chunk of hair loss - I hate it !&lt;br /&gt;I would give it a zero star if I could !!!!</li>
    <li> Made my curly hair even more frizzy and dry. Plus it smells awful.</li>
    <li> Shampoo smells nice.  My husband tells me all the time that he loves the smell of my hair.  I have wavy thick hair.  I also bought the conditioner for this line as well.  It smells just as nice but my hair is coarse as well.  My hair still feels a little dry...that&#x27;s the reason why I knocked off a star.  I haven&#x27;t tried the other products in this line.  Maybe it will work with hair that&#x27;s not like mine.  I still use this shampoo since it&#x27;s sulfate free.</li>
    <li> The Product was like any other hair shampoo. I purchased it with the L&#x27;Oreal Evercurl Sculpt and Hold Cream Gel, because It was my understanding that I needed this product for  the Evercurl Sculpt and Hold cream to work. However, even after following the directions, the Sculpt and Hold cream Gel did not work.</li>
    <li> best hair care for curly thick hair</li>
    <li> Does not, in any way, encourage my already wavy/lightly curly hair to be more curly or to stay curly all day.</li>
    <li> Wonderful shampoo. Thick and creamy, it moisturizes and eliminates frizz fairly well. It also smells delicious. A salon quality product for a fraction of the price. Defines my curls and gives them extra bounce.</li>
    <li> Adds moisture to dry and color treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again in the future and will recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> False advertising. It says it is sulfate free but what is one of the top 10 ingredients? Sodium laureth sulfate.</li>
