      <li>Great tweezers!</li>
      <li>These are the best I have found.</li>
      <li>GLAD I DID!!!</li>
      <li>It has a great grip and incredible precision not to mention the quality construction.  </li>
      <li>did the job and works great</li>
      <li>The ones I received are great, and I am ordering a spare pair.</li>
      <li>great tweezers, i bought these on the recommendation of Aaron Marino, who has a style and lifestyle blog/site, as well as makes youtube, i swear sometimes</li>
      <li>I use these for stray hairs around my eyebrows and they have worked great for about 2 months now with no problems yet.</li>
      <li>and I think the great grip will work well on my kid&#x27;s splinters this summer.</li>
      <li>Works great on those mutant eyebrow hairs, too.</li>
      <li>Finding these tweezers was a pleasant surprise</li>
      <li>We are very satisfied with our purchase.</li>

      <li>Excellent quality strong easy to grip and do a really good job.</li>
      <li>I love them!</li>
      <li>Love these tweezers!</li>
      <li>Ewww, I know, but most guys have been there!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy for those that found it was worth a 5 star review, maybe I got a defective one.</li>
      <li>So glad I did.</li>
      <li>The ApeX Tweezers are okay.  </li>
      <li>I have used many tweezers and none compare to these.</li>
      <li>What more to say.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good quality tweezer.</li>
      <li>I noticed that my husband was always borrowing my tweezers and really needed a pair of his own.</li>
      <li>The grips hold on to the finest of hairs so that a quick motion</li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t even mildly acceptable.</li>
      <li>It is worth the price &amp;#34;comes with a lifetime warranty&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Does not grip hairs very well!</li>
      <li>I have had better - hard to pull hair out - tweeze man better</li>
      <li>I have a pair of straight edged tweezers that I purchased for $3 at the local drug store that are MUCH better.</li>
      <li>I have NO idea where all these positive reviews are coming from, the manufacturer?</li>
      <li>[a long time ago] so I know how to use  tweezers, I&#x27;ve been through many tweezers, so I have no doubt,</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them and am glad I finally found some that do the job.</li>
      <li>I was able to successfully deploy these to pull out an ear hair that had been driving me crazy for weeks.</li>
      <li>I will definitely buy one for my travel bag and a few others as it makes for great gifts.</li>
      <li>very percise and painless for my eyebrows</li>
      <li>A real let-down after being sucked in by the ad.</li>
      <li>They are 4 inches long, very sturdy, and the ends are smooth and rounded.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t get every tiny hair that my other pair does, but the fact that the tip is rounded makes tweezing sensitive skin much more comfortable.</li>
      <li>Most tweezers are very sharp on the ends.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many kinds of tweezers, including some of the more expensive ones.</li>
      <li>I received this as a gift and was not sure about the round tip, but this is the most amazing tweezer I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend these to anyone.</li>
      <li>Works well, would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend these for anyone needing quality tweezers.</li>
      <li>It also comes with a cute little storing pouch.</li>
      <li>They will not pick up fine hairs without extreme effort.</li>
      <li>He said they are very durable and much easier to use than the tiny pair of mine.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t work as well as my 8 year old Tweezerman&#x27;s - which are lost.  </li>
      <li>so i know i got it all, really cant praise these tweezers enough</li>
      <li>These are good for a little larger area where you want to firmly grasp small groups of hairs, a sliver or some other particles where you don&#x27;t need to be as precise but want to be effective using less time.</li>
      <li>We had been looking for high quality tweezers and we definitely found them here.  </li>
      <li>These are good; round edges are hard to find ...</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have other tweezer purchases to compare them to, but these are pretty solid.</li>
      <li>These are by far the worst pair of tweezers I have ever bought and at $20 I expect these to be flawless.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately these tweezers just aren&#x27;t very &amp;#34;precision.&amp;#34; Don&#x27;t work on fine facial hair which is what i need them for.</li>
      <li>but they are larger in general than my tweezerman&#x27;s</li>

<li> I used to use my wife&#x27;s Revlon tweezers which came to a sharp point.</li>

<li> , I have to press down harder with these</li>
<li> I ordered these as have never tried the round tweezers.</li>

<li> it&#x27;s gone) and round tips</li>
<li> It was round tipped</li>
<li> No more ingrown hairs</li>
<li> After attempting to remove 12 hairs from my arm, I was not able to tweeze out even one of them.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews</li>
<li> Plus, these are a lot less scary looking to a toddler with a splinter in their hand!</li>
<li> Stop buy crap and by something that works and is gonna last.</li>
<li> They seem to be well-made, but, in fact, are totally useless.</li>
<li> If you hate drug store tweezers, and are desperate, give these a try.  </li>
<li> These are the worst tweezers I have ever used.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> did the job and works great</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have other tweezer purchases to compare them to, but these are pretty solid.</li>
    <li> Works well, would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> We had been looking for high quality tweezers and we definitely found them here.  We are very satisfied with our purchase.</li>
    <li> I have tried many kinds of tweezers, including some of the more expensive ones. These are the best I have found. They grab the hair every time, yet do not have any sharp points or edges like others I have tried. They don&#x27;t cut the hair, they get it out.  I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews - maybe there is a quality control issue. The ones I received are great, and I am ordering a spare pair. I needed tweezers that could pluck out tiny hairs on my eyelids that sometimes touch the eye. These work every time!  I highly recommend them and am glad I finally found some that do the job.</li>
    <li> These &amp;#34;GorillaKilla&amp;#34; tweezers are wonderful. They are 4 inches long, very sturdy, and the ends are smooth and rounded. I was able to successfully deploy these to pull out an ear hair that had been driving me crazy for weeks. Ewww, I know, but most guys have been there! Because of the shape, you don&#x27;t have to twist around in 14 directions to grab on and risk scratching the inside of your ear with a sharp end. Works great on those mutant eyebrow hairs, too.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift and was not sure about the round tip, but this is the most amazing tweezer I have ever used.  I no longer pinch myself.  It has a great grip and incredible precision not to mention the quality construction.  I will definitely buy one for my travel bag and a few others as it makes for great gifts.</li>
    <li> Awesome.  What more to say.  Most tweezers are very sharp on the ends.  The sof rounded tips are perfect for my needs.  Quality product.</li>
    <li> And that says a lot. They do not look it since the point is rounded and I have always thought that the slanted ones were optimal. Finding these tweezers was a pleasant surprise and I will order them again if I misplace this one or want another.</li>
    <li> I noticed that my husband was always borrowing my tweezers and really needed a pair of his own. I gave these to him and he couldn&#x27;t be happier. He said they are very durable and much easier to use than the tiny pair of mine. I would highly recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> I used to use my wife&#x27;s Revlon tweezers which came to a sharp point. I often pinched myself with them by accident. I love these tweezers as they have great grip, precision touch (it&#x27;s almost like I just swoop by the hair and poof...it&#x27;s gone) and round tips so I don&#x27;t accidentally pinch/prick my skin! I&#x27;d highly recommend these for anyone needing quality tweezers.</li>
    <li> No more ingrown hairs</li>
    <li> Great tweezers! Discovered them through the &amp;#34;Alpha M&amp;#34; website and thought I&#x27;d give them a try -- GLAD I DID!!!</li>
    <li> Does not grip hairs very well!</li>
    <li> I was turned on to this product by IamAlphaM.com I have used many tweezers and none compare to these. The round tip makes it so the hair doesn&#x27;t get clipped, cut, or torn. The grips hold on to the finest of hairs so that a quick motion and they are gone. Sturdy construction. Stop buy crap and by something that works and is gonna last.</li>
    <li> These are the worst tweezers I have ever used. After attempting to remove 12 hairs from my arm, I was not able to tweeze out even one of them. On the tweezer&#x27;s handle is etched the word &amp;#34;Gorillakilla&amp;#34;. They seem to be well-made, but, in fact, are totally useless. A real let-down after being sucked in by the ad. They are not worth the cost of shipping them back to the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several pairs of tweezers that didn&#x27;t work and one pair that did. It was round tipped so I wanted another round tipped as a back up in  case I ever lost my old pair. I couldn&#x27;t find any in a store so decided to try these. I love them! They will grip and tweeze the tiniest, shortest hairs. They work!</li>
    <li> The ApeX Tweezers are okay.  They don&#x27;t grip and hold well, so 2-3 tries are sometimes required.  They don&#x27;t work as well as my 8 year old Tweezerman&#x27;s - which are lost.  And I can&#x27;t find the same rounded tip anywhere.  Hence, I tried these.  If you hate drug store tweezers, and are desperate, give these a try.  I&#x27;ll keep looking for the elusive round-tip Tweezerman&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately these tweezers just aren&#x27;t very &amp;#34;precision.&amp;#34; Don&#x27;t work on fine facial hair which is what i need them for.</li>
    <li> I prefer a round tip to slanted. I do not regret this purchase at all. It is worth the price &amp;#34;comes with a lifetime warranty&amp;#34;. U can grab the tinyest if hairs with no slip or pain. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good quality tweezer. It also comes with a cute little storing pouch.</li>
    <li> I have NO idea where all these positive reviews are coming from, the manufacturer? These are by far the worst pair of tweezers I have ever bought and at $20 I expect these to be flawless. They aren&#x27;t even mildly acceptable. They will not pick up fine hairs without extreme effort. I have a pair of straight edged tweezers that I purchased for $3 at the local drug store that are MUCH better. I am returning these.</li>
    <li> great tweezers, i bought these on the recommendation of Aaron Marino, who has a style and lifestyle blog/site, as well as makes youtube, i swear sometimes i dont even feel the hair being plucked out but when i do i see the root so i know i got it all, really cant praise these tweezers enough</li>
    <li> Love these tweezers! very percise and painless for my eyebrows and I think the great grip will work well on my kid&#x27;s splinters this summer. My friend recommended them to me and I thought I&#x27;d give them a try. So glad I did.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers, better than any others we&#x27;ve used. Excellent quality strong easy to grip and do a really good job.</li>
    <li> I use these for stray hairs around my eyebrows and they have worked great for about 2 months now with no problems yet. Still get even the littlest hairs.  2 year update: I still have these tweezers actually. They are still working about as well as when I got them, no complaints.</li>
    <li> I ordered these as have never tried the round tweezers. These are good for a little larger area where you want to firmly grasp small groups of hairs, a sliver or some other particles where you don&#x27;t need to be as precise but want to be effective using less time. Quality item</li>
    <li> I have had better - hard to pull hair out - tweeze man better</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a tweezing expert... These are good; round edges are hard to find ... It does the trick, I have to press down harder with these but they are larger in general than my tweezerman&#x27;s</li>
    <li> These are my second favorite tweezers, just behind a black revlon pair I have. They don&#x27;t get every tiny hair that my other pair does, but the fact that the tip is rounded makes tweezing sensitive skin much more comfortable. Plus, these are a lot less scary looking to a toddler with a splinter in their hand!</li>
    <li> I always read the reviews before ordering, based on the reviews I did order. I don&#x27;t understand all the 5 stars! I&#x27;ve been using tweezers since I was a teenager [a long time ago] so I know how to use  tweezers, I&#x27;ve been through many tweezers, so I have no doubt, it&#x27;s not me not knowing how to use them. I&#x27;m currently using my Revlon tweezers bought years ago in the pharmacy for much much less than these. I&#x27;m happy for those that found it was worth a 5 star review, maybe I got a defective one.</li>
