<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The reviews are true ladies, I ordered this as my first nail Art set and so didn&#x27;t know much about sizes of plates or even how to do it. Now I&#x27;m experienced and realize how hard it is to make the small full nail designs work. The designs in this set stamp perfect and are detailed nicely, however the full nail designs are too small for an adult nail. I&lt;br /&gt;My wedding band is. Size 4, so I have little fingers, and the full nail designs are still too small. Bottom line, if you are buying this set for the single designs, then go for it. But if you are buying for the full nail design, you are better off going with the bundle monster sets made in later years because the size is enlarged for N adult nail</li>
    <li> DOES EVERY IMAGE ON EACH PLATE STAMP PERFECTLY?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, it doesn&#x27;t BUT most of them do! (if you stamp correctly.)&lt;br /&gt;For the price you get them for, I think they&#x27;re allowed one or two images than aren&#x27;t cut out as deep as the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the variety of the images and I was surprised they stamp almost every time without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHOULD YOU BUY THESE?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely!&lt;br /&gt;Personally I wouldn&#x27;t pay $5 (more or less) for 1 plate if I can get them at a much better price, about $10 for 21 of them.&lt;br /&gt;WOULD YOU?</li>
    <li> I have seen other plates like these that work wonderfully but they cost more too. I thought I would get these because it appeared to be a good deal. You get what you pay for! I really think that the problem with these is that the designs aren&#x27;t cut deep enough into the plate and they don&#x27;t work at all. I hate them!</li>
    <li> I got these for my first stamping experience with a Konad stamper and scraper. It took about two hours to do my nails. I figured it was because I was new or wasn&#x27;t doing it right. I just got a set of Mash plates and I used some mash and on BM plate. The images on the mash plates all worked on the first try. The BM image took multiple tries and required touch ups because the image didn&#x27;t transfer all the way. These just aren&#x27;t great quality.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t work out for me. I think that nail stamp is a waste of money. I would never buy one ever again.</li>
    <li> These stamps are just like or even better than konad. The designs are unique. At just under $18 this is a steal. You&#x27;d be spending six times more if you purchased twenty one stamps from konad. I find that with these image plates transfering the image to the stamp is much easier. I agree that the full nail designs are not wide enough to cover the entire nail. Nonetheless I love my new image plates and would like to see more in the future from this seller. I also feel that using an old credit or gift card works better when scraping off the excess nail polish. It is much more gentle and does not scratch the surface of the image plate as with the scraper that comes with the konad system. All in all I&#x27;d recommend this to everyone and I would repurchase if need be :)</li>
    <li> These plates are so great and are almost identical to the Konad ones that I had to pay $7 each for. This is such a good deal, and I hope they continue to make more nail art plates. I will definitely buy more when they are offered. The only thing that needs to be improved on is some of the edges of the plates can be a bit rough and scratch your finger if you were to rub around the edge. And the designs meant for full nail coverage aren&#x27;t quite big enough for the thumb nail, but some of the Konad plates are like that also. Overall, this is still a great deal.</li>
    <li> These plates aren&#x27;t the same quality as Konad, rough edges and some slight imperfections with the reliefs, but what a great value.  They were on sale and I paid $17 for 21 plates - that&#x27;s what I paid for 2 Konad plates!  Well worth it.</li>
    <li> Work Great,but I cut myself on the edges of the plates. Other than that no issues. I use LA Colors Nail Polish and Sally Hansen Xterme Wear on the plates and find the LA Colors to work the best.</li>
    <li> While I don&#x27;t think that these are of quite the same quality as the Konad plates, you certainly cannot beat this price! For how many plates and designs you get, it was worth every penny. Just be careful when removing the plastic, they are very sharp! I just filed the edges of mine with an emery board and that took care of the problem.</li>
    <li> I received the plates within days of ordering. The quality of the stamped image is comparible to Konad. Creative designs that are different than what is offered by Konad but the full nail designs are super narrow. I hope they offer more plates and designs!   The service costumer its great!! I have a little problem with my order and they resolved it so fast, they sent me the replacements for free, I would definitely buy from again and again!</li>
    <li> Very good product, works as it is supposed to and price was exactly right! I have had all types of lovely nails since I got these.</li>
    <li> This plates are so cool, i am so happy that i bought them. Price and quality are great, but there is only one problem. Edges on this plate are very sharp so if you buy them be very careful when you removing foil from plate because you can cut your self. But if you are careful there is no problem.</li>
    <li> Like others have stated in their review, the designs may not be as detailed as Konad but sometimes you don&#x27;t want a lot of detail - you want a simple design.  The full image designs fit most of my nails (all except the thumb) but these are totally worth it.  I hope they come out with more because I will definitely purchase them again and again.</li>
    <li> Great deal and great product. All plates work very well just as the Konad ones. We love these plates.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never played with nail art stamping before and I really love these plates.  So many choices and great designs from fun, flirty, themed, etc.  I was so excited to get these in the mail and used them right away.  They are a lot easier to use than expected and easy to clean.  They fit nicely in the Konad plate holder and work great with the Konad hand held stamper.  I love playing with all of the designs, mismatching, and combining.  I really enjoy doing my nails now and I get more compliments too.  And the great price for this bundle is hard to beat, psst main reason why I bought them.  Thought it was too good to be true, but they are great, all of the plates are in great shape and there are no faults in the designs.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, almost perfect, only that the full nail designs are a little small to fit the whole nail,so it sometimes ends up half stamped. But besides that, I love it.</li>
    <li> after 2 hrs of trial and error im getting the hang of it and its actually easy and semi-fool proof. yes you do need \\&quot;special polish\\&quot; china glaze&#x27;s chrome and romantique collection works well for the design plates, or... any good chrome would do. i have not encountered a design that does not transfer yet. but we&#x27;ll see  edge is sharp and cut my skin when i first receive it.but i guess, tats preventable if you&#x27;re careful when holding the plate  NOW THE REAL REASON WHY IM NOT GIVING IT FIVE STARS  shany offers what looks like the same product +3 more plate for 10 dollars here on amazon. DOH.... i found out right after i orderedit23</li>
    <li> I usually only use konad brand image plates...and pay 7 dollars each. When I saw these plates, I couldn&#x27;t let a deal like this pass me up. So glad I gave them a try! Wow, what a bargain!  I had no trouble getting the images to transfer and they work just as good as the Konad plates.  Here are a few minor differences I noted..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bundle monster plates are a bit sharp around the edges, so if you have small children....please take a nail file around the edges to dull them down to prevent the risk of being cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The full images are smaller than konad&#x27;s full images. So, if you have larger nail beds, you may have to complete the transfer in two steps to fully cover the nail. A bit tricky to do, but other&#x27;s have mastered it beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no paper backing on the bundle monster plates, but to me that&#x27;s no big deal really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and one last thing...each bundle monster plate is covered with thin plastic film that has to be pulled off before they will work...again, no big deal really, but if you didn&#x27;t realize this, the images wouldn&#x27;t transfer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love them! I can&#x27;t believe the price of these plates.  My friend and Neighbor also ordered her a set and she loves them too.  We can&#x27;t wait till they come out with a different set...and will be the first in line to place our orders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Stamping!!</li>
    <li> I was totally satisfied with my purchase, excellent product and seller correct. Received in less than 20 days in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I like these plates a lot and they&#x27;re almost as good as the name brand Konad. There is a ton of variety and designs to pick from. The full image designs fit most of my nails with the exception of my thumb which is okay. I can usually line the stamp up to repeat the pattern or cleverly hide the edge with a stamped french tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two reasons why they didn&#x27;t get a perfect 5 star rating...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, he plates are very thin with no backing like the Konad plates which makes them malleable... a bent plate is useless so definitely be careful there and watch your fingers. I would recommend backing them with cardstock or something similar, especially if kids will be using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And secondly, on one of my plates, the designs are flawed where they weren&#x27;t fully cut/carved out. Aside from the one, the rest had great craftsmanship and work like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the Monster Bundle is a great value for the quantity especially considering the Konad plates run about six dollars a piece. I would definitely buy these again.</li>
    <li> I said that I got my image plates in the mail today and saw that they were used but I forgot that I had to peel off the film before use with the film on it really looks used but it was very very new when I started peeling off the film you really cannot beat the price THANKS</li>
    <li> I purchased these stamps because I was doing a \\&quot;little princess\\&quot; party. I do a lot of abstract nail art, and time wouldn&#x27;t allow for that. These were the perfect solution, and very cost effective (wasn&#x27;t willing to purchase Konad because I don&#x27;t use them regularly, though I did use them with Konad polish, scaper, and stamper). They got the job done, and all the girls were able to find a design they liked. They take a little practice. You have to move fast, and make sure that the placement is good, or the design will be crooked. The only bad thing was a few of the designs seem to not be etched deep enough, and were a little harder to pick up. Other than that, good product, great price.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I received this in the mail. I had never heard of Nail Art Stamping, until I went on youtube and looked it up and I feel in love with it! I just had to buy it, and this was the cheapest one around. There is a ton a differnt designs so you won&#x27;t get bored. You can be creative with this too. I can&#x27;t wait to start working on these soon. But the only thing about it, is it doesnt have a backing on the plates, so its pretty sharp so becareful. So im going to have to put some backings on the plates to be on the safe side so I wont get cut anymore.</li>
    <li> I purchased this bundle because I felt it was a great buy. It is much cheaper than buying the bundle or individual plates from Konad. One major issue (which has been echoed a few times by others) is that the design is quite small. The bigger images meant to cover your entire nail only can do so for my pinky, ring finger and sometimes my pointer finger. Overall I still rate it as a good product. very easy to manage with many options. It takes some getting use to but with time and effort each design can and will have a polished look.</li>
    <li> Upon seeing so many tutorials on youtube on the Bundle master, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try these out. The shipement was extremely fast, and they arrived very well packaged. They plates are very pretty, but my only set back is the full finger plates still did not cover my whole nail bed. My fingers are not that small and the plates are only half an inch. The image is not big enough to stamp my whole finger. (thumb and middle finger- which the width is more then half an inch across). I really wish Bundle monster would make thier full finger image plates just a bit bigger. (this will make me and all the not so tiny people a whole lot happier) As for being satisfied, Yes, I am.        Please make images on your full finger plates bigger!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered the 21 pack of the bundle monster plates. They seem to have added a back to the plates. It had a protective blue cover, and I immediately removed them. I cannot get any of the images to transfer though. I have tried everything. My polishes that work with Konad plates won&#x27;t even work. Has anyone else had this problem?</li>
    <li> I ordered this set since I enjoy the new 25pc set so much. Some of the negative reviews on this made me skip on it before but since the price is right and shipping its free I decided to give them a try... OMG I&#x27;m so glad I did because these plates are awesome! The only negative thing I agree with is the fact that the full nail images are a little small for the thumb nail but I work around that by centering the image on my thumb. If you don&#x27;t like that idea there are many other designs here to chose from that its still a good buy for the french tips &amp; single designs.     Another gripe from part reviewers is that the plates are sharp &amp; don&#x27;t have a protective backing like the new set. Well this has been fixed and all plates now have it.    The biggest complaint that ultimately made me pass these up the first time was that many people had trouble getting the images to transfer. That was a big deal to me since that&#x27;s the whole point of buying them in the first place. Well I tested all images and have had no issues getting any of them to transfer. I have a few tips that might help:    ~ be sure to remove the plastic, blue film before doing anything else  ~ images transfer much better when your base polish color is still slightly wet  ~ try applying a top coat before stamping if base polish color is completely dry  ~ try using a thick, opaque polish, it is NOT necessary to use konad special polish  ~ be sure that you scrape ALL excess polish away with no extra goop left over the image  ~ pick up the image from the plate with the rubber stamp in a rolling motion  ~ look at the stamp to ensure the image transferred before applying to the nail  ~ apply image to the nail in a rolling motion as the stamp and your nails are slightly rounded    I hope those still skeptical will give the 17pc set a try. I&#x27;m glad I did! Good luck &amp; happy stamping!</li>
    <li> I found that a number of the designs won&#x27;t work for me.  It is like some of the plates aren&#x27;t etched deeply enough.  Some of them I was able to use a needle tool to clean the grooves and get them to work. some or them not so much.  The Halloween ones were the biggest disappointment since I was hoping to use them for a party and none of them work.</li>
    <li> I purchased these last week and got them pretty quickly. I couldnt wait to try them on so i started to pay around with them. They work great!! I would have given these a 5 star but i didnt because the plates that are for a full nail size. are very very small! They dont fit my thumb nails and fit just perfect on the other nails. But i will just do those on the index finger giving that they dont fit all my nails. Other than the full nail size plates being small, all the other designs are perfect and fit just fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m ordering the other set soon. Bundle Monster is amazing. I bought this in the beginning of September, and I use it every two weeks. It really takes practice, but it&#x27;s so entertaining and I love the designs. My nail beds are also a bit wide for these designs, but I hear that it&#x27;s fixed in the next set, and it&#x27;s really just a matter of matching up the patterns.   I would recommend these to anybody who is a nail-polish junkie like me. Just make sure that your nails are completely dry ( I usually wait a day just to be sure) and you&#x27;re good to go!   Great product, I would (and have!) recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> I am thrilled at the quality and variety of this bundle and will order again. I am amazed at how quickly the product arrived in Ireland from the U.S., a full 7 days ahead of the estimated delivery date and just in time to be a stocking filler for my daughter. Can&#x27;t wait to order more.</li>
    <li> the package was open inside the mailing envelope and 1 plate was missing from the set, the plates work as expected.</li>
    <li> It was nice to be able to find a cheap alternative to the Konad plates.  They do their job well.  I have had them for months now, and I have yet to use them all.  They have not scratched, and I have had no issues cleaning them off with my fingernail polish remover.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I bought these image plates! I have tried quite a few of the plates in this set and have not had any problems with them. The price was irresistible for me, I will order many more plates if BundleMonster comes up with more designs. I do wish they had some larger designs that would cover the whole nail (the largest designs in this set do not cover my thumb nail completely)  *I measured one of the full nail designs and it was approximately 1cm X 1.4cm. Hope this info helps!    Helpful hints;    -Make sure you remove the protective plastic cover from the front of the plates before attempting to use.  -Wet a cotton ball w/ pure acetone and hold it with tweezers in order to avoid ruining the designs on your nails. Use the acetone soaked cotton ball to wipe nail polish off of the plates and stamper. The plate should be dry before applying more polish.  -Use a thick highly pigmented polish for stamping.  -Work fast! If you take too long the polish will dry on the plate or stamper and you will not get it to transfer.  -If you are working fast and the polish does not transfer try another type of polish, some polished are extra quick drying.  -Be gentle when you apply top coat or you may smear your design.</li>
    <li> this product is very budget friendly,the plates are amazing shipping was super fast,so overall awesome product and seller!</li>
    <li> this product is awesome and the price is amazing, I will never buy another name brand image plate for 6.99 a piece again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve searched the internet high &amp; low for the best deal on Konad Image plates, and no one had an ofer that could best this one. It&#x27;s a super buy and the seller ships even faster than the Konad site that I had also ordered from that day.  The plates are brand new as advertised and come 3 to a package. Couldn&#x27;t ask for anymore.</li>
    <li> I didnt get the stuff first time, lost in postage, they resent me and I got it. Good comunication. Very happy customer.</li>
    <li> I like this product, not the greatest but good for the price.    PROS:  -Cheap  -You don&#x27;t feel bad about scratching them  -A lot of cute designs that are non floral unlike KONAD (a lot of floral)  -Full finger design fits me just fine except for the thumb (it&#x27;s a bit small)  -Plenty of designs to choose from    CONS:  -Edges are really SHARP  -The bigger designs tend to smear   -Disregarded some of the larger designs because it just looked like a blob even after I scraped it thin  -The metal is a lot thinner  -The designs are not as detailed</li>
    <li> I love this product, and think it&#x27;s great that there&#x27;s so many image plates included. I love stars, and there&#x27;s a lot of star-themed patterns in this set. I also like that the majority of these patterns aren&#x27;t floral, as opposed to Konad&#x27;s. However, with my order, I got a duplicate number 15 plate, and no number 16 plate. Also, the plates are so thin and sharp around the edges that I got cut. The last problem I have with this product is that, even though my nail beds aren&#x27;t very large, the images that are supposed to be for the full nails didn&#x27;t cover all the way.</li>
    <li> Love the product, and worked like a charm! Took a couple of tries to get it right, and practice makes perfect. Now I have flawless designs with so many complements! Now mom and sister wants one! Highly recommended! You get so many designs for a great price!</li>
    <li> While I am not disappointed in the quantity of images you get when you order the Bundle Monster Image Plates, I am quite sad with the quality of the images. Some of the images refuse to transfer regardless of what kind of polish I&#x27;m using. I&#x27;ve had mediocre luck with them at best. Also, I have pretty normal-sized nail beds, but the full-nail images don&#x27;t cover them at all. This, in my opinion, was a major oversight in production. Or they did it on purpose to fit more images on each plate. Either way, they don&#x27;t work, so there was no point in it. A metal scraper doesn&#x27;t really work with these, which is no big deal, but it&#x27;s nice for people to know what they&#x27;ll be getting. The plastic film is really hard to get off, so remember to be careful as these are just little discs of sharp metal.    PROS:  &#x3D;lots of images to choose from  &#x3D;good price compared to Konad  &#x3D;tip designs and single-image designs work well    CONS:  &#x3D;full nail is WAY too small for normal nails  &#x3D;some images are hard to pick up properly  &#x3D;plastic film is really hard to remove  &#x3D;edges are sharp    +/-  &#x3D;metal scraper doesn&#x27;t work at all with these plates</li>
    <li> They have some really nice images, easy to use and a lot cheaper than the konad ones. worth the money</li>
    <li> Theses nail plates are great quality. The larger squares are a little small to cover whole nail so just match up and stamp another tomatch up on nail. These work just as well as KONAD. Do not hesitate it is a GREAT purchase you willnot regret it. I will buy more for Xmas gifts.  *****IMPORTANT****** Remember to remove the protective covering, when they come in they all look scratched up. Do not freak...it is a protective clear sticker film over top each plate. Remove each one as you use. A good way to store is go buy a Card Collector clear plastic inserts for binders. You can buy at Walmart in photo section and buy adhesive velcro andcliptofit each pocket to hold in place and buy a coolbinder etc to store them in. Again BUY THIS SUPRDUPER Deal : )</li>
    <li> This \\&quot;bundle\\&quot; had a large collection of art; a little something for everyone.  These disks worked well.  There is a protecting cover that has to be peeled off of each disk.  This is easy to do.  I would be careful of the edges of the disks as they are rather sharp.  I may sand them down a little.  Younger children should be supervised due to the sharpness.  All in all, a good product at a good price.</li>
    <li> This was the first set of discs I purchased. I have done so many different designs with this. Wonderful purchase. Will buy more for Christmas presents...</li>
    <li> Description was right on.  I have had a lot of fun playing with this set!  I wish there were more!!</li>
    <li> Some designs don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> i got my plates sooner than expected and i really like them. Its worth the price...was spending too much for konads ips...just becareful with edges cause they r sharp and i got cut but other than that i love doing my nails and always get compliments.AMO!</li>
    <li> 21 Image Plates for under 20$! They work just like the Konad Stamping Image Plates, they just cost a lot less. Be careful the edges on the Image Plates are a little sharp. Great Value!</li>
    <li> bundle monster you are amazing my mom bought me these for christmas and I &lt;3 them the edges were a little sharp and they do seem to scratch easily so instead of the scraper I use a credit card like another reviewer said and I sanded the edges off to make the edges duller since they are a bit sharp just to be on the safe side.... amazing product hoping they come out with more!!!!!</li>
    <li> I liked almost all the plates, except two, so it&#x27;s a wonderful thing to buy! Now every week my nails have a different design.</li>
    <li> This item is worth its price. True the image does not fit the entire nail but that just allows now creativity in deciding how to go around it. But with the amount of images available, I don&#x27;t think I will get tired of this item anytime soon.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love my plates.  close to konad plates, except these r kinda sharp around the edges. but you can&#x27;t beat the price, especially for their quality.  i love, love, love these and definetly recommend them!</li>
    <li> For the price you paying you get great product. They dont have a lot of details but it has some nice designs.</li>
    <li> This was a great deal compared to Konads nail plates. Just remeber to remove the plastic coating on top of the nail plates. They offer a lot of different designs. Some of the full nail designs are a little small if you wear fake nails. I don&#x27;t know if Konads are that way.</li>
    <li> Since I am new to stamp art I didn&#x27;t want to spend $7 for a single tiny image plate so when I saw this deal I was so happy. These plates are a must have for a beginner. All the unique images give you the chance to see what types of design you will tend to use most so you can buy future plates wisely. One of my plates did have a line through two of the images but other than that I was happy with the quality and they worked just like the expensive image plates. Like other reviewers, I recommend you be careful with the edges and make sure you buy the proper stamper, scraper, and nail polish before using. It takes some practice getting used to stamping technique but if you practice enough you will get great images each time.</li>
    <li> Something went wrong with my order, but after an email to their CS everything was ok. Just got in the replacement, so that was quick!     CS is good and so are my products.</li>
    <li> the bundle monster nail art polish stamps are so cool they are very easy to use it can get a little bit messy but they make your nails come out great love love love them !!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this as I&#x27;d heard good reviews of it from several friends who have bought it and having just recently gotten into stamping thought I&#x27;d take a chance on it as it&#x27;s such good value! The plates have lots of choices of design on them and like everyone says ... make sure you take the plastic off the plate before you use it!    The shipping to the UK is reasonable and it came really quickly. My bundle had a plate missing and a replacement was sent and arrived really quickly so I&#x27;m super impressed!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this product because I think nail designs are cute. I&#x27;ve never done anything like it before and didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on Konad only to find I didn&#x27;t like it. Well, I think that the variety of designs you get with this are fab.     However, the full nail images are small. They may cover my full pinky nail, but that&#x27;s it. When testing them out I found it impossible to use regular nail polish for the image. I tried a nail art polish, as well, and it worked a bit better but I feel like stamping polish is probably best. Overall, I think it&#x27;s a really great deal for the money.    UPDATE 5/16/11  I&#x27;m changing my rating from 3 to 4 stars. I find that these stamps do work well and print with regular polish. However, the regular polish must pass the 1 coat to opaque test. Sally Hansen Insta-Dry works really well. So, it really is a great deal. I&#x27;m not making it 5 stars because the full nail images are still small.</li>
    <li> I received the plates within days of ordering.  The quality of the stamped image is comparible to Konad.  Creative designs that are different than what is offered by Konad.  I hope they offer more plates/designs!  Very much worth the price!</li>
    <li> I loved my Bundle Monster IP&#x27;s they are soo cool. Fast shipping I ordered Tuesday and received them on Friday. The images are soo many to pick from its like a kid at a candy store LOL. I think they are better than Konad I have 10 Konad IP&#x27;s and with Konad you can&#x27;t get every single part of the image BUT with the Bundle Monster you can with the very first try! I got my family and friends wanting to buy the Bundle Monster IP&#x27;s. I would really love to see what else Bundle Monster comes up with next they should consider making their own polishes and tools and more IP&#x27;s. I will defiantly keep buying from Bundle Monster!! GREAT PRODUCT!!!!!</li>
    <li> I received my package in THREE days - awesome. So when I was going through these I wasn&#x27;t expecting much because of the price difference, but I had good reviews and for the price, it was worth a shot. These are AWESOME. Some images better than others of course..but if you love nail stamping...this is the best deal you will find. This is the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a while and can&#x27;t wait to change my nails again! Thanks Bundle Monster!</li>
    <li> I order these image plates a few days ago &amp; they are great!!! I love all the designs. :D</li>
    <li> HI. I bought this image set and i love it. Everyone who see&#x27;s my nails loves them. they look like i went to a salon to get them done. one bad thing is that the whole nail images and the french tips DONT fit your thumb nail. those are probley the ones you&#x27;ll have to buy from konad. sort of sucks but whatever the rest are awsome! Have fun.</li>
    <li> This nail stamping kit is great. 21 nail stamping plates for the price of 3 Konad plates. My only complaints is that some of the designs aren&#x27;t etched in deep enough so they wont show up and the full print ones dont cover my entire finger but I still think these plates are well worth the price!!1</li>
    <li> Well when i first saw it here i thought \\&quot;well lets give it a try, whats the worst that could happen?\\&quot; but now that i have them its awesome, almost every image stamps and i love all the compliments about my nails well worth the money, great product for half the money compared with the other brand. I never had a problem with the edges of the product but I still created a backing for the plates and now i don&#x27;t worry about it.</li>
    <li> I have to say that the plates are a great deal. I mean when Konad plates are $6.99 each and you can get 21 of these for $[...], anyone would be a fool not to buy them. :)  There are a few designs that are made without clear detail and don&#x27;t stamp well and the full nail designs are too small for my thumbs but all in all still a good deal.  I hope Bundle Monster comes out with another set. I&#x27;d be the first to buy them.  Check my blog to see what designs I have made with them. They are listed under BM and the number of the plate.  Susie  [...].</li>
    <li> Pour de fausses plaques Konad elles sont juste supers! Les motifs sont très sympa; sur 21 plaques je n&#x27;en ai eu qu&#x27;une avec des défauts mais qui n&#x27;empêchent pas l&#x27;utilisation. Les plaques m&#x27;ont été livrées en 1 semaine environ!  Pour ce prix, ça serait dommage de se priver!!!</li>
    <li> these plates are just as good as the expensive plates.  thanks to all the chicks that posted reviews and pics using their great bundle monster purchase.</li>
    <li> I was frustrated at first but it was user error. A great tip I saw for the actual stamper was to roughen it up a bit. The plates work great, definitely need to play with them a bit but all frustration I experienced was my own fault. At first a couple of the bad reviews made sense but, again, user error. I cannot say this enough. The seller was extremely prompt. I cannot emphasize this point enough, before you get mad at the product play with it before just being unfair. Super product &amp; not just &amp;#34;for the price&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with my recent purchase of these image plates.  I have the Konad stamping kit and these plates work excellent!  When I received my order I had a duplicate plate of one style and was missing one of the image plates (as all 21 plates have unique images and are numbered 1-21).  I contacted the company and they apologized and promptly shipped me the missing plate.  I would definitely recommend buying these plates and ordering from Bundle Monster.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I have seen these on some beauty blogs, and i&#x27;m glad i found a good deal on Amazon for so many cute designs. They are quite easy to apply on which makes me save so much from manicures. I am just a beginner so of course, it will take me more time to practice for perfection, but so far, the quality is pretty good, the edges are crisp and the finish is quite clean. great buy!</li>
    <li> produit avec pellicule de protection à l&#x27;achat sur chaque plaque.  Coller un papier sur la partie de dessous ou utiliser un set de table lors de l&#x27;utilisation car raye la table.    Beaucoup de combinaisons possible. Un vrai régal et amusement.</li>
    <li> I have the Konad nail art and was leary about ordering this set but it is deffinately worth the money. Not as high a quality but they work as well and I love the designs. I have no regret purchasing them. they arrived quick and I have an issue at the start with shipping and they fixed it right away. I recommend these to everyone. They are worth it!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The full nail images are too small for most fingers</li>
    <li> product is great! easy to use and clean. all of my friends love it too!</li>
    <li> These plates are great - a wide variety of designs and nearly impossible to damage.  The only downside is that a lot of the smaller designs are hard to clean, which makes it difficult to pick the design up with the stamper.  If it weren&#x27;t for that, I&#x27;d give them five stars.</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking it was too good to be true, but hoping I would be wrong. Happily, I was! This product works great! I bought it along with the Konad two sided nail stamper and scraper, and the combo work great! I didn&#x27;t buy the Konad special nail polishes, but the higher end nail polishes have worked out well so far and even some cheap ones from Walmart. I suggest you try some alternatives out before you dive in to buy the expensive Konad stuff because there are others that work! Anyway, I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product and like everyone else, I&#x27;m hoping Bundle Monster will make another set!     Also, for the reviewers stating the plates were all scratched and they couldn&#x27;t get an image - there IS an *extremely thin* film over each plate! It won&#x27;t even look like it and the plate will still feel indented, but it&#x27;s there!</li>
    <li> i love these!!! the designs are great!!! love them!!    at the mall each plate is 7.00...i got a deal!!!</li>
    <li> Ok product. Some images are good. Some smudge everytime i try to use them. Full nail image too small for my nails and i dont have very big nails.</li>
    <li> I had previously purchased this set for myself, and purchased another set for my mother. It was delivered in about a week and there are many different patterns to choose from. Only downfall is that the full-print designs are a little to small for my nails (I have large nailbeds)</li>
    <li> Firstly I&#x27;d like to thank the seller for the speedy delivery of the plate, as the first delivery, they gave me a duplicate of one plate and when i emailed them for my missing plate, they apologized and told me they will send me a new one rightaway, which arrived in about a week or so. I&#x27;m pleased with my plates, only thing is the prints are too small in surface area, meaning when i do them on my big toes, i cant get the full picture unless i stamp more than once to fill in all the gaps.    It would be awesome if they could make the print area larger, that would be perfect.    A recommended buy! Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have searched everywhere for a better deal on these stamping plates and there isn&#x27;t one. I&#x27;ve even seen them at flea markets/swap meets for $6 a plate. They are in great condition when you receive them. There are just so many images to choose from they will match anyone&#x27;s personal style!      Now I just need to find a place to buy the special polish for less.</li>
    <li> When I ordered these plates, I was aware that the sizes were smaller than the current Konad plates.  I had also read that some people had problems picking up full images from these plates.  I haven&#x27;t tried every single image yet, but so far, I&#x27;ve only found 1 image that wasn&#x27;t properly etched.  Perhaps the quality on this run of plates is better?  At any rate, great price for a large selection of images.</li>
    <li> Great product. Very affordable. A lot of the images are from konad but without the expensiveness. It kinda has sharp edges but nothing to worry about. Works just as good as the original konad. I&#x27;d def recommend it especially if you don&#x27;t have the funds to splurge.</li>
    <li> Perfect product! Exactly what I was looking for, great variety and a terrific price. Very quick ship and in perfect condition!</li>
    <li> These are the first plates that I ever tried. I purchased the Konad stamper and blade and used these plates with some of my normal nail polish stash. There are a ton of designs and the whole nail designs tile nicely for those with long nails.    The first thing you will learn is that not all nail polish will work. It has to be thick and highly pigmented for it to work nicely. Anything that quick dries will most likely dry before you can get it on your nail and will leave you frustrated. If you are not having any luck with your polishes, you might want to suck it up and buy the \\&quot;special polish\\&quot; that Konad sells. I later purchased the black and white polishes and they are wonderful.     Once you get the hang of it, this system is really easy to use and very fulfilling. I love giving manicures to my family members now!</li>
    <li> So i bought this bundle monster&#x27;s stamping image plates, and i am not very satisfied with this product. I tried using normal nail polish and it always don&#x27;t work. Also, when i try to stamp the image on my nails, the image is not large enough to stamp the whole nail. I find it a waste of money as it really can&#x27;t stamp nicely and can&#x27;t make one image stamp the whole nail. I would go with Konad rather than Bundle Monster&#x27;s image plates as konad&#x27;s image plates images are much larger and hence, able to stamp the whole nail.    However, i had not tried the image plates using special nail polish such as konad&#x27;s nail polish as i do not have it. But i still find this image plates not really worth it. Although most image are similar to konad&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this product (as I am a nail art aficionado)...that was until the plates arrived. The plates arrived in the same condition that others have described in the other reviews (all in one package, stacked one on top of the other, and with plastic film on front and paper backing on the back). I removed the plastic film and used (Konad brand) special polish, (Konad brand) scraper, and (Konad brand) stamper. I&#x27;m only stating this so that if you are reading this you know that I did everything &#x27;right&#x27; and these plates had they been usable should have worked. I worked quickly as I always do and several designs failed to transfer to the stamper at all (and of course the ones that didn&#x27;t work were the ones I wanted this set for in the first place) and several of the other images only partially worked (only half of the design would transfer to the stamper). I know there are those who will say I didn&#x27;t work fast enough but that is just not true I scraped and stamped within seconds and I even tried the plates with regular nail polish (China Glaze, OPI, Finger Paints, and ORLY) and got the same result. Now before I continue I would like to state that this is not my first time to the dance. I have a bunch (30 or so) Konad plates and I have been doing nail stamping art for a couple months now (on myself and on others), I know all the ins and outs, tricks and tips of stamping nail art and still couldn&#x27;t get the plates to work. I am really upset that only 10 of the designs (designs not plates) have actually worked and the rest are useless. After I closely examined the plates I think the problem is that the image is not cut deeply enough into the plates. If I run my finger over the Konad plates, then over the Bundle Monster plates there is a distinct difference (the Konad designs are cut more deeply into the plates). I don&#x27;t know if I got faulty plates or they are all like this but I am left wanting my money back because right now the plates are $18 paper weights. I will not buy this brand again I&#x27;d rather spend my money on Konad plates because they actually work.I will not buy this brand again I&#x27;d rather spend my money on Konad plates because they actually work.</li>
    <li> I heard about Konad and really wanted to try, but these were just too good to be true price wize.  I bought and tried pink nails with little red lips.  While it took me a while to learn, I did get the hang of it and I love the designs and the cuteness of it all!</li>
    <li> I have a bunch of the Konad stamping plates so I was looking for some more and came across these. The shipping was fast and even came earlier than expected. They work really well and there are so many awesome designs to choose from. I would say to be careful because the edges are pretty sharp and it would be easy to cut yourself on them.</li>
    <li> not good!do not waste your time and money</li>
    <li> These plates have many designs and they&#x27;re not etched in too shallow making them very easy to use. The only possible downside is that you should have a stamper before ordering these because one isn&#x27;t included and you have to be careful when peeling the plastic film off, but you can&#x27;t forget that 21 plates for $18 is an awesome bargain. And the sellers shipping is very fast my plates arrived four days after ordering.</li>
    <li> Most nail stamping plates retail for around $7 a plate. These are 17.99 for 21, and they&#x27;re excellent!! I&#x27;ve had so much fun playing with them. 2 things: The edges are very sharp (so be careful!) and some of the full nail designs are a quite narrow. I find both of these things easy to work around but it may be helpful for you to know this before you buy. Also, this company has excellent customer service. There was a tiny problem with my order and they fixed it SUPER fast.</li>
    <li> Like most of the other reviews, I agree that the plates need to be a tad bit bigger. Even on smaller nails, they never cover the thumb completely. I would say to invest in some nail art pens to fill in the tiny bits that do not cover. I also felt that not all of the designs transfer super well. I tried several different polish brands including the Konad polish (Konad polish still yielded the best results) but some just didn&#x27;t transfer as great as the Konad plates do...they definitely are not as deeply etched. HOWEVER, for the price it is still a phenomenal deal for the variety you get and for all the designs that DID transfer great-worth it totally! OH...one more thing, I have two Konad scrapers and two different Konad stampers....I noticed that I got WAY better results with the plastic scraper than the metal. I also liked the single sided stamper because the shorter handle enabled me to get a more even pressure when transferring the design. SO...when you buy the scraper...try to get the plastic one (it even works better than using a gift/credit card).</li>
    <li> Once I figured out the film cover over the plates, I was really happy with how well they transfer.  But the full nail images are simply too small.  My nails are not super long, just past the tips of my fingers, but the full nail images will only cover my pinkies.  I&#x27;ve been trying to learn how to double stamp to cover the whole nail, but the trial and error is a serious process and I simply don&#x27;t have that kind of time.  It&#x27;s a shame, too, as I prefer the whole nail designs over the smaller designs.  Half of the images are useless to me thanks to the small size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see my entire Konad system collecting dust simply because I can&#x27;t do what I want to with them.</li>
    <li> what a variety! the designs are so beautiful and of such good quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love them ALL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lol I lack fingernails now, i wanna try them all! XD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they all are so stylish and beautiful, it works perfectly with the most basic kit of konad stamp and scrapper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didnt buy the base to hold the disc, I didnt consider it necessary, and i was right, it isnt necessary&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it works perfectly just like it is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;little, handy and easy to store! they weight almost nothing, and I dont get why it has some bad reviews. Its a really good buy, in my opinion, this set is pure win - it comes out a lot more cheap than to be buying each plate one by one separately&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am SO happy with my purchase I may order again as gifts to my girlfriends!</li>
    <li> A Wonder-filled value- uh-huh! In this Package of nail stamps you &#x27;will&#x27; find something for Any Occasion...&lt;br /&gt;If you aren&#x27;t familiar with Nail Stamping - there are many youtube videos to check out. It&#x27;s A FUN thing to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The edges on these fauxnads (faux-konads)are a bit sharp. nothing to worry about~ I filed the edges making them even easier to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this large assortment from MONSTER BUNDLE, my youngest daughter has included (Intruded?) herself into my fetish of nail stamping -&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s a lovely 10 year old :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special Konad polishes aren&#x27;t necessary. I usually use any polish from China Glaze to OPI for my stamps. The metallic polishes or holograms show up the best. A-lot of thick cremes work too...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An amateur nail stamper needs only a hint of imagination ~ in making your nails (long, short or young nails)&lt;br /&gt;Look like a $50-$75 fantasy work of art...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to search out what &#x27;you can do&#x27; by checking out some Konad nail stamping videos or pictures.  Amazing - these little stamps go from classy, everyday beautiful designs - or party fun!&lt;br /&gt;My hope is that lil&#x27; Bundle Monster is searching out new designs to sell!&lt;br /&gt;(P.S. You&#x27;ll still need a Konad transfer stamper &amp; a scraper...don&#x27;t forget!)</li>
    <li> I purchased this kit, a bit worried about the quality because it was so cheap! But really it is good quality. No problem so far with any of the plate tried.  In the 21 pieces of the kit, one plate was defective(no pattern relief). I contacted the customer service and they replace it right away.  I am very happy with this purchase and I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have no complaints about konad/bundle monster stamping, but I wish some of the designs had wider lasering/lines.  Some designs don&#x27;t show up if the paint can get into it.  I would also recommend buying the special konad paint in black and white.  Regular black and white polish fades, depending on the foundation color.</li>
    <li> ok so what am i doing wrong? i removed the clear plastic cover i applied white kodad polish to the plate i used the kodad tool to wipe off polish and the image did not go on the stamp.</li>
    <li> Some of the plates might not be as sharp as the Konad plates, but if you want to have more designs to choose from this is well worth the money. Tip; They come out better if you use a good nail polish.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a cheaper alternative to Konad stamps, these are it.    Bundle Monster has some very nice designs that Konad does not.    Cons:  I could not get all of the designs on the plates to work, especialy with regular nail polish.</li>
    <li> I bought these plates because my daughters spent the night at a friends and came home with the cutest nails.  When I asked about them their friend showed me her &#x27;name brand&#x27; set that she paid about $50 for.  It had two plates some polish, a stamper &amp; a scraper.  I thought it was adorable but was not going to pay that kind of money.  Bargain hunter than I am I searched for a better deal.  Which led me to Bundle Monster and another &#x27;off brand&#x27; that I found on ebay for similar value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought both sets.  The received the ebay ones first.  They were a great value came with some extras &amp; offered cute plates (a few with the same designs from one plate to the next).  They even offered the same designs and our neighbor girl had on her &#x27;name brand&#x27; plates (none of which were &#x27;full nail&#x27; or &#x27;french tip&#x27; images).  I was quite satisfied but have to say when I received the plates from Bundle Monster I soon realized I preferred their images better.  They were larger for the most part &amp; a much nicer selection over all (I hope they continue to add to their designs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY Con I would mention is that the edges seem a bit sharp (compared to both the name brand &amp; the other off brand I purchased) so I would keep them out of reach from young fingers even if they are just &#x27;looking at the designs&#x27;.  My teenage daughter cut herself on one not paying attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who are having problems with them here are some tips &amp; step by step instructions I use (mentioned by others but with so many reviews I will post it as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips to Know Before you get started:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) REMOVE the plastic film:  They come with a plastic film when you first receive them that sometimes can not be seen.  I used something sharp (tweezers) to cut a spot &amp; then removed the rest with my fingers.  If you do not remove the film the plates do not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Use THICK but NOT Quick Dry Contrasting Nail Polish for Images: If you do not have a &#x27;thick&#x27; polish &amp; do not want to spend $10+ on the &#x27;name brand&#x27; let one of yours dry out a bit or go to your local salon that does nails &amp; see if they have some &#x27;old stuff&#x27; that you can buy for pennies on the dollar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use quick dry you may not get the transfer done quick enough before it drys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a few variations of colors but for obvious reasons white &amp; black work best.  A dark color with a white or light pink print or a light color with a black or similar dark will have the best results.  Do some practice ones on something to see what you really like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Use one coat cover for Bottom Coat &amp; Top Coat: I recommend using nail polish that IS quick dry &amp; only takes one coat to cover for both the Bottom &amp; Top Coats (not images).  This is because the more nail polish you have on your nails the more likely it is to smear your images.  Using quick dry also helps with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Use a Good Acetone nail remover:  It seems this works best for cleaning the plates.  Some remover seems to thin out the polish &amp; make it more difficult to transfer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Let the Plates DRY completely: After each transfer you will need to clean the plate (if there is polish in the image you will not get a good transfer).  When you wipe the polish out let the remover dry before you put polish on it.  Again it will thin out the polish making for a poor transfer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) Use Cotton Rounds instead of Balls:  Cotton Rounds make it a lot easier to manage the nail remover without messing up your nails.  I use a nail polish remover with a pump so (one touch remover) I don&#x27;t have to do too much with my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7) Between EACH STEP let your nails dry for the best possible results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8) If you don&#x27;t have a plate holder (which I highly recommend) use double sided scotch tape to hold the plates in place on whatever you are scraping the extra paint onto.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9) I also recommend the two sided stamper with the smaller stamp.  It is much easier to ensure the best image placement for smaller images.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10) If you have larger nail beds you may want to overlap designs.  Everyone has different nail bed sizes so it would be difficult to accommodate everyone.  With practice one could learn to line up the designs for a fuller image but I would recommend either using more than one design or just overlapping them.  It can create a nice effect as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10) Clean EVERYTHING thoroughly when you are done: This will be important so that your future painting will be more successful &amp; so that the plates, stamper &amp; scraper last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My personal steps:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Wash hands &amp; gently push back cuticles that might be up on nail bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Get out all needed products &amp; items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Paint nails with bottom coat.  Let dry completely (VERY important for best results)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Prepare image plate, image nail polish &amp; cotton round with polish remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Working Quickly - Paint a nice coat of image paint over your image, scrape away extra, stamp with stamper, line up with nail bed, roll on fast, firmly &amp; carefully ensuring you get the entire image to transfer.  (If you have never seen this done check out a youtube video on it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) After each image you will have to clean the plate completely (especially if you are using the same image for each nail).  Be sure to do so carefully not to smudge your other nails.  Some recommend using tweezers - I find if I use a Cotton round instead of a ball I don&#x27;t need to.  Again let the polish remover dry on the plate before adding the polish again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7) I recommend doing all your images on one hand BEFORE putting on the top coat.  Just be gentle not to &#x27;bump&#x27; them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8) Once your first hand is complete put on your top coat &amp; let this dry Completely before starting your second hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9) Repeat for second hand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you get the hang of it use multiple designs &amp; colors.  We have used it to stamp our phones &amp; more (and change when we get bored)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you enjoy this as much as I did!  All the little Girls in my life (age appropriate of course) will be getting this for the next &#x27;gift giving&#x27; occasion!!want to overlap designs.

    <li> This was a wonderful deal, considering what the prices of just one image plate are from Konad. The designs are clean and come up well, with crisp edges to them. They arrived in record time thanks to the quick shipping from the supplier. Wonderful deal, I look forward to seeing what else they come up with.</li>
    <li> This item came fast and it was brand new! The plates are not sharp like it says because they are round lol&lt;br /&gt;If you want the designs to come out you have to buy the Konad polish because regular polishes don&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> Wow do I love these plates! I read the reviews before buying and was hesitant before ordering, but I decided that I would give it a try because I love to have cute nails. After using them multiple times I can say that I adore them. I always get complemented on my nails. I really like the stamps for the entire nail even though it doesn&#x27;t exactly fit all the way on my thumb (I fill the empty space with a smaller design to go along with the big one). All in all I love this product. It does have some faults, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s my nail polish or just the stamp. Some of the designs don&#x27;t pick up and some come out a little smudged, but I can&#x27;t complain because the ones that do come out right look fantastic. As the other reviews say, there is plastic on top of the plates so be sure to take it off. As far as the edges of the plates being sharp, I don&#x27;t think so at all. I only have a couple &#x27;expensive&#x27; nail polish&#x27;s and the rest I have is &#x27;cheap&#x27; stuff, and I don&#x27;t notice a difference in the way it stamps. Give them a try and see for yourself!</li>
    <li> These are awesome, so many designs to create. I could do my nails every day for three months and not use one design twice. Can&#x27;t wait to play...</li>
    <li> I started off with a couple Konad plates (from a starter set) and wanted more. I didn&#x27;t wanna pay $6.50usd a plate! When I found this Bundle Monster collection I was impressed with the price!    Pros: cheap cheap cheap!!!! If you want the konad look, but don&#x27;t wanna pay the high price, this is a great option! Even with official konad stuff, you&#x27;d still save instead of going to the salon, but this Bundle Monster pack is more of a deal!  Fun/funky designs, some similar to official konad plates (I&#x27;m so happy there was a cupcake design like Konad) There is so many designs, I have a hard time deciding how to do my nails every week.    Cons: The french-tip and full image ones are on the skinny side. I have narrow long nails, so my only problem nail is my thumb to stamp. One would need to double-stamp, or just space it just right.   The plates have sharp edges, enough to be tearing apart the inside package it came in. No biggie really, you won&#x27;t cut yourself - but be cautious if you are going to use this with children.    tools I used with them:   konad stamper (must have)   old credit-card like card as a scraper  paper towel or a couple layers of newspaper underneath the plate  Cream or any thick polish - Konad special polish works (and takes forever to dry), but thats expensive too (bundle monster please make some!). But any polish works, just stay away from ones that are sheer, look \\&quot;watery\\&quot;, or a polish that you&#x27;ve worn that you know takes a couple coats.  Top coat - do a top coat before you stamp (in case you make a mistake) and after once it dries completely  Nail polish remover/cotton swabs to clean plates and scraper while you are stamping  Watch tutorials online on how to use konad! Saying these are hard to use because it&#x27;s messy is just your own error.</li>
    <li> I have spent all the money I saved and then more in buying nail polish that transfers with these plates. Needs to be bright and thick.</li>
    <li> Shipping - fast!! Product - great!!!! Price - LOW!!!! Not as high quality as Konad, but totally worth bying! Plates work well and the designs are pretty!!!!!!!! I recommend! PS images for the whole nail are not for long nails - they are too small. But I dont think it is a drawback. You can use the pattern twice on the nail and the problem solved!</li>
    <li> I got my first konad set in October 2010 from my boyfriend after he noticed me looking at the nail designs i could achieve with stamping images on my nails. Soon after he brought it me, plates M2 and M3 bored me and i knew i needed more variety - i read up on a few nail blogs, and there was a lot of coverage on the monster bundle set with some examples of art the bloggers had achieved with the set. I live in the Uk, the set came within 6 days!! - which is just fantastic!, the price was fantastic for what you get, and the communication throughout my purchase has really impressed me!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Highly recommend this set! - yes everyone states the edges are sharp on the disks, but to date i&#x27;ve had no scratches&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy stamping &#x3D;)) x</li>
    <li> This product works as well as Konad nail art. You just need to take off the protective plastic on each disk and away you go...enjoy making all kinds of designs.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the product, edges too sharp for a product that is supposed to be used for kids,hard to be cleaned, bad compared with others that I know.</li>
    <li> it has enough designs you could wear a different one every day.&lt;br /&gt;they look just like the konad ones and the quality is the same, they work perfect with my nail stamp and i couldn&#x27;t be happier. glad i got this.</li>
    <li> I love it, but you do need to purchase a scraper and stamper.  It will not come with those things. Want to see a video of how to use it go to [...]</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about purchasing these plates having used Konad for a while. I must say I was pleasantly surprised when I tried them out. The images are small so I do not recommend them for long acrylic nails, but they are very cute!</li>
    <li> I did receive them quickly, couldn&#x27;t resist the price.  But the edges are sharp, and no matter what I did, several of the images would not transfer.  Was so excited to use the Spider Web design for Halloween, but it&#x27;s like the etching was too small, would not transfer at all.  And the full nail ones are quite small, they will not fit my thumbs.  Better to be slightly larger than too small.  I also found that they scratch very easily. Some of them worked, but some of the ones I was most excited about didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I recived every thing that was promised and in excelent condition.  Thank you very much</li>
    <li> PROs:   - fast shipping  - variety of designs  - really CHEAP, 2 Konads compared to 21 of same price  - some designs have same quality with Konad plates    CONs:  - some designs are not etched deep enough, like the spider web, i was soo excited for that for Halloween but much to my dismay it wont transfer even with special nail polish. I tried it 10x with different polish, i always end up being disappointed  - very sharp edge  - even after taking the plastic shield off, some plates are still scratched. No biggie..  - the full nail designs are not wide enough. Considering, I have a small nail, but it still wont cover my thumb and middle finger.    TIPS:  - when you take the plastic shield off, use an emery board. Works better than tweezer. Just buff the edge towards the center and peel it off..  - to avoid getting cut with the sharp edge, glue it with a thin cardboard before using. I just use a Cherios box. Lol.   - I didnt use the Konad scraper because plates scratched more easily compared to Konad plates but an old credit card cut in 2, works just fine..    Would I order another one if they have 2nd batch? YES  Would I recommend it to friends? Already Did!</li>
    <li> This is a really good product for the price! I recently bought 1 Konad plate and it was already $4-$5!!!   In addition, I don&#x27;t know if anyone else noticed this, but the edges are sharp and I&#x27;ve gotten a few cuts from holding the plate. So, be careful! Other than those edges, this is an amazing product :] Well worth the money</li>
    <li> I have so much fun stamping my nails!!! This is the best product for stamping nails. My friends are always telling me how pretty my nails are. And they can&#x27;t believe it when I tell them I do my nails myself. Thanks for this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I would buy this set over and over if they had more sets like this. Such a great buy, just a great as the Konad brand but so much cheaper and so much more for your money! I use them all the time and they are so easy to use! I take them over the friends houses and show them how to use them and they love it. You do need the STAMP and SCRAPER and its best you buy from Konad directly. The only problem I have had is that you have to have a really opaque nail polish to get a really great stamp. Glitter work if you just want a foil look but for most you need an opaque for them to work, which I don&#x27;t have a problem with! It gives me a reason to buy more nail polish!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter.  Great for quick accurate designs.  Make sure that you have a stamp and blade, sold seperately right here on amazon.  Shipping was quick.</li>
    <li> Plates are plates. These work just as well as the Konad plates, and are MUCH cheaper! Only reason I&#x27;m giving 4/5 is because the pattern designs are not big enough for nails, press ons, my natural nails, my friends nails, etc. If full nail patterns is what you are looking for get the KONAD plates.&lt;br /&gt;The little images on these BM plates are perfect though!</li>
    <li> These plates are very cheap as compared to Konad plates. However, the quality is slightly inferior. Some of the designs are not properly engraved. What a disappointment, but since the majority is working, it&#x27;s still a good deal.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s an extensive selection of designs however I found some of them were not very effective at transefering the image onto the stamp. It&#x27;s a bit trial and erorr-y. Also the whole nail designs were a little small. They were fine for my fingernails but only just. There are some really nice images to play with and for the price i still think this was an excellent deal.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered quickly and in good quality. Makes a great gift at a considerable price. Does not arrive in any sort of box or packaging besides plastic wrap. Metal plates are sharp around the edges and user should be wary.</li>
    <li> These plates are a great value compared to Konad plates. The images are cute and easy to use. I ordered both sets of bundle monsters at the same time and received a duplicate plate and missing another. Customer service was awesome. I just emailed them and they sent me a replacement!!! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a great deal,hard to believe I got this many plate for this price and they are all brand new thanks alot.</li>
    <li> These plates are just cheaper (price-wise and quality) versions of Konad plates. You get 21 plates for about $18, and shipping is free, so that&#x27;s quite an irresistible deal, but I have to say, these plates CANNOT compare to the Konad plates.   First of all, there is no safety backing on the plates, as many people have written already; the plates are very thin, and can be very sharp. I resorted to pasting the plates to index cards so it&#x27;s less likely to slice into my fingers, and to prevent the plates from scratching each other.   Secondly, the designs of the plates are not as intricate and well done as the Konad plates. I have a bunch of Konad plates, and the BM designs definitely don&#x27;t come close. The BM designs are not as detailed, and just are not as \\&quot;pretty\\&quot; as the Konad designs (but of course, you get what you pay for). Also, some of the plates I got, seems like there were manufacturing flaws. The designs on the plates appear smeared, or smudged, and when I tried to stamp them, the images do not transfer properly, if at all.   Thridly, the full nail designs don&#x27;t actually fit on your whole nail (unless you have really small hands, or are a child). I learned that if I&#x27;m very precise on how I stamp, I can get away with stamping the \\&quot;full nail\\&quot; designs from my index to my pinky. Thumb is definitely out of the question, lest you end up with a half stamped thumb, or you&#x27;re good enough to stamp in two halves (you have to really match up the designs). I&#x27;ve never had this problem with Konad designs.   Fourthly, some of my plates arrived with water and rust stains. I don&#x27;t understand how this happens, since there is a thin Saran type film ontop the plates when you first get them. This must mean that the plates have somehow gotten wet during manufacturing process, but before the packaging process. This doens&#x27;t interfere with the stamping process, but I just find it annoying to have rust and water marks on my plates.   Overall, these plates are dirt cheap (under a dollarfor each plate), compared to Konad which are between $4-7 per plate, but you get what you pay for, and Bundle Monster plates definitely do NOT compare to the quality of Konad&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I was so close to returning these today after having them a month and getting more and more irritated that they weren&#x27;t picking up the nail polish or working. I read a few reviews today to figure out why they were all talking about it working and finally got it through my thick skull that there is a PROTECTIVE LAYER on top. Peeled it off and all the scratches came off too of course. Now I&#x27;m itching to get back to painting. So please, peel off that layer.</li>
    <li> This bundlemonster is a perfect option for those that don&#x27;t wish to buy Konad plates. It&#x27;s a great variety of images, and they have good quality. No sharp edges! Shipping to scandinavia was super fast. In all, I&#x27;m very statisfied.</li>
    <li> some of the full nail designs/prints are a bit smaller than the Konad designs, but overall I like the variety of the designs.</li>
    <li> I love these plates! The images transfer perfectly and look gorgeous on. Some aren&#x27;t completely centered, but they still work great! Can&#x27;t wait to use them all. Would definately buy again! Better price than konads. I would recommend these to anyone looking for lots of fun designs to do on their nails.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this set of bundle monster plates. There are lots of new designs and many that coordinate to create a full nail design or use as small accents for those who want a minimal effect. The plates seem to be etched deeper than the last set I bought. I had good transfers from all I have tried so far. The biggest drawback I see is that the full nail designs are to small. I use them to make half nail design and still had to patch edges. There are a lot more holiday etchings but would like to see a new years one like a champagne glass with streamers although I can do that myself I love the extreme detail these image plates produce. The biggest issue for me is picking a polish that has enough contrast. I find myself wanting to try something else after a few days because there are so many fun ideas to choose from. I stopped using the UV topcoat so I could change polish more often.</li>
    <li> I bought these plates about a month ago &amp; I use them all of the time.  I have had nothing but good outcomes w/ all of the images that I have used.  In fact I&#x27;m also going to be purchasing the new set of 25.  If you are looking for high quality plates these are the way to go!  I have and will continue to enjoy these plates.</li>
    <li> I just got my Bundle Monster set from Amazon.co.uk and they are a huge disappointment!!! The designs are super lovely, the quality is ok, but the sizes??? Oh, don&#x27;t get me started on sizes... They look like they are made for kids nails. Since I am not a giant person myself, (I admit I have larger nailbeds) the full nail designs should have worked, you think.... But full nail designs only cover my pinkie and ring finger. I am so sorry to have bought this set... If you happen to have large nailbeds, please reconsider buying these plates.</li>
    <li> Hi.  I bought this item two years ago, and till now i have only one complaint: the size of the \\&quot;full nail\\&quot; prints are a bit small, and it doesn&#x27;t cover all my nails... so i must stamp twice some fingers. In the other hand, it&#x27;s verry easy to stamp with it, so now i do it verry fast that i don&#x27;t complain anymore. The stamps are verry cute and fashion. Realy worth it.  The seller offers a low cost shipping.</li>
    <li> The image plates arrived about 2 days ago and I was so impressed! They&#x27;re everything I hoped for! I haven&#x27;t had the chance to actually test them out with the Konad stamper but overall I&#x27;m extremely happy with the purchase I have made :) I can&#x27;t wait to use them ! :)</li>
    <li> I bought these knowing that the full nail images would be a little smaller than the Konad full nail images. I&#x27;ve always had very small hands/fingernails so I was hoping that these would work out well for me... but alas they did not. The full nail images are just a bit smaller than the size of my fingernail. (My fingernails are not long by any means) It is also difficult to try and fill in the gaps with another layer.. maybe with some practice it could be pulled off though. However, for the price of these it was worth it. I&#x27;m still glad (and a little dizzy from playing with these all day) about this purchase. :)</li>
    <li> My product has not arrived! so I can not say anything about it yet. Once the product arrives to express my opinion about it. thank you!</li>
    <li> The package comes all together. They seemed a lot larger than they were and the designs are a little small. Great for people with shorter nails but harder for people with longer nails because some of the designs may not fit. Overall very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I received these along with the second set for Valentine&#x27;s Day from my Husband and I truly Love them...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried each one and they all stamp extremely well...!!! :)</li>
    <li> If you are looking for lots with one bundle, this is it!  Great assortment and all new!  items were packed well with film on to prevent scratching and shipped quickly!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Great value and lots of great images. The only downside is that the edges of the plates are rather sharp - handle them with care.</li>
    <li> This had lots of images to choose from.Good for a beginner.Not to difficult to use and easy clean up.I would be advised I did find the edges to be sharper than I expected.I bought these to use on my girls(ages 2 and 5)and they love them!However some of the images are to large for their nails,but they&#x27;ll grow into them.</li>
    <li> estoi encantada con mi compra, llego mucho antes de lo esperado, me ha sorprendido gratamente, mi primera compra en internet con el miedo que me daba y sin ningun problema, en 10 dias en casa, y muy bien empaquetado, gracias por todo, a sido genial y muy comodo</li>
    <li> wow, quick shipping!!! i&#x27;ve been wanted to try nail stamping, but didn&#x27;t want to invest toooooo much money in a set of plates. these Bundle Monster plates were exactly what i was looking for. a set of different designs to experiment with...wow imagine my surprise when i found out how easy they are to use and such a variety of designs. i liked them so much i&#x27;ve now ordered the new set of plates as well. go Bundle Monster!!! ;D</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found that the images on the plates were very well designed, they scrape easily, and the image comes off well on the stamper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two flaws I found with my batch of plates were:&lt;br /&gt;I had a few plates which were not centered on the plastic backing, so those plates were causing sharp edges.&lt;br /&gt;The other flaw was all of my plates in this batch were already peeling away from their plastic backing before I finished opening the product from mailing packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to be very careful when I use them, because the blue plastic backing is peeling away from the metal plates. I feel that the plastic backings were not secured using the right type of glue... maybe because they were extremely warped when shipped that caused the backings to peel away from plates? I am able to use them, I just have to hold them down flat, to undue the warp, to scrape evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that when I bought these plates, they were just starting to get very popular... maybe my batch was made in a hurry??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased with the quality of the images, and how they transfer to stamper, I&#x27;m not too pleased on how they arrived; warped, and most uneven on protective backings.</li>
    <li> These where a great price first off! if you were to buy 21 name brand plates it would cost around $60-$100. So it takes some practice...at least for me. Some designs work better than others. Mostly the ones that are very fine and thin lined are hard for me to get on the stamper. But i really enjoy the product. So many designs you could go awhile with out having to repeat one. So you get professional looking nails at home with very little effort. Who can complain about that? I highly recommend... this is a great use of the money you wont be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I am so glad I got this prouduct I work outside my home and I get so many people telling me they really like my nails and it is so easy to do.</li>
    <li> These are great plates. The images come out nice and clean. However the one MAJOR flaw is that the full nail images are way too narrow. The only nail I can completely cover with an image is my pinkie nail. It is very disappointing and is why I can only give the product 3 stars. :(</li>
    <li> The plates have great images, which is why I ordered them. However, the images do not stamp neatly. The images are not as clear or crisp as the Konad plates. I have tried the plates with several different brands and color of polish with the same results. It could be a user error :). If anyone reads this and has any suggestions, please let me know.</li>
    <li> This was my first foray into nail-stamping. I&#x27;ve had this set for 9 months now, and my plates are in great shape. Granted, I made little paper pouches for each one.     Pro-tip! If you place these face-down on a scanner bed (but a sheet of acetate down to protect the glass from the edges!) and scan them then invert the image and play with the contrast, you can get a GREAT black-and-white image of each plate, similar to the item photo but high-resolution. I printed the plate design onto each pouch and that makes it easy to look through and pick out the plate I want.    Pros:   1. CHEAP. You get 21 for less than a buck a piece (as of my purchase time).  2. Comparable quality. Some plates don&#x27;t print amazingly, but with good polish and speed, they all work well.  3. Variety, themes. There are different designs on each plate and lots of holiday themes and the like.    Cons (the reason for 4 stars instead of 5):  1. Sharp edges. Don&#x27;t toss these plates in a purse with your iPod or cell phone!  2. Full-nail designs too small for even MY nails. I have very short nails and short nail beds. My nails widen at the tips and my thumbnails are normal-width, and I could not use the full-nail design. These would be perfect for childrens&#x27; nails, and I successfully used them by stamping in the middle and then painting a color to each side of the nail where the design didn&#x27;t reach.    Both cons have been corrected in the new set [[ASIN:B004XJNQXW Bundle Monster Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates Accessories Set Kit 25pc]], but this is still a good deal, especially if you have children (just don&#x27;t let them hold the plates!). I still use plates from this set, even with the new one.</li>
    <li> i was so so excited when i bought these.... i&#x27;m so disappointed now that i have received them. they are all really cute designs  i used them with the konad special polish and the mash scraper and transfer and most of them dont work. i tried and tried but it either doesnt transfer at all or a lil piece of it does. i am so disappointed i really wish they&#x27;d cut the designs deeper. they look so cute on those images i&#x27;ve seen but i cant get to use them at all. theyre just sitting there.... sigh</li>
    <li> I love the different designs Bunble Monster offers. The quality is Awesome too. I recommend this to everyone! especially those who love doing nail art</li>
    <li> I cant seem to get these things to work for nothing i have used about a million types of polish and none of them hold!</li>
    <li> These plates got great reviews so I bought them, they are very nice and work just as great as Konad brand for such a great price. I love them.</li>
    <li> This is my first set of stamping plates and after trying several of them, i must sya that they all work very nicely.  I used a variety of regular nail polishes and had no problems.  The plastic is super easy to get off of the plates and the designs have a nice variety of pasterns.  I love them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really kind of confused.  I ordered this, and it came very quickly, however I was not sent ANY of the plates shown.  Looking around, it appears they sent me plates from another listing.  It would be too much work to return them and ask for the ones I ordered, so I&#x27;ll be keeping them, but I&#x27;m kind of disappointed because there were some images I really wanted that I definitely ordered...but clearly did not receive. Maybe I&#x27;ll just stick with Konad stuff from now on.</li>
    <li> When I got these in the mail and peeled off the blue lining some of them had large/multiple scratches on them... making the designs they went thru not usable but luckily they were all designs I don&#x27;t plan on ever using.  Overall, however, these are pretty decent for the price!</li>
    <li> many thanks ! did not take long to arrive ! It was well wrapped and protected ! good quality stuff !&lt;br /&gt;to recommend !</li>
    <li> This is my first non-Konad stamping nail plates and I&#x27;m in love. They are super easy to use with some great and fun designs. Considering I&#x27;m a very new stamper, I&#x27;ve had great success. I do wish the full plates were a smidge larger. I have larger nail beds and have to double stamp with these. But, so far I&#x27;ve used them on every single manicure I&#x27;ve done since receiving them.    I hope they have a new set of 21 coming out soon! I&#x27;d also love to see them create and distribute their own line of polishes.</li>
    <li> I bought these to try them out since I own almost the whole Konad collection, and I love these! It&#x27;s a great deal, gave it a 4 not a 5 because the full nail designs are super narrow! The designs I have tried have come out wonderfully!</li>
    <li> I loved the bundle plates, and they were totally easy to use! you save a ton on manicures, and can create thousands of designs yourself. awesome!</li>
    <li> Great Product, fast delivery and I got exactly what I ordered by the photo! These are really great and brilliant idea!!  Really, the set has so many different etching, I wish I could try them all right away! One commenter stated that they didn&#x27;t work and were not etched enough, which I didn&#x27;t read until I had ordered my set(and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t) She was totally wrong!! The set works well with all my nail polishes except the High speed/fast dry one coat nail polish that I have and that&#x27;s understand able it just drys too fast to be used with the plates. I do believe that using a thicker polish is better but not necessary. This is a fun thing to do with friends and family, my friends loved it and are thinking of buying a set for themselves. My daughter is looking forward to trying it at well.  I&#x27;d recommend Bundle Monster to all woman that want something pretty and fun on there nails!!</li>
    <li> This was a great product. I will definitely buy more from you in the future. Thank you! I appreciate the quick service and high quality.</li>
    <li> This product worked flawlessly. I have never been big into doing my nails, but now I do my daughter and nieces nails all the time (usually twice a week) and these plates always work perfectly with the Konad stamper and scraper. The only time I ever had a problem was when I didn&#x27;t realize the protective plastic film had not been pulled off a disk I was using for the first time(it&#x27;s hard to tell if you haven&#x27;t already pulled it off) and I was getting really frustrated with it and thinking of a previous review I read, until I realized why and pulled off the plastic, then it worked brilliantly. Some of my polishes don&#x27;t work great with it (too sheer, shimmery, or fast drying) but most do. So many designs for such a low price! It&#x27;s a steal! I&#x27;m adding a few nails I did with the product to the images so you can see how detailed an image these can create on your nails.</li>
    <li> I ordered these image plates on August 13th and was told they were shipped on August 16th. They gave me an estimated delivery time of August 24th, but I received them today August 20th. So I received these plates in a week since I placed the order. &#x3D;) As soon as I got them I started stamping swatches. I used the Konad special nail polishes and had really good results. *you can see a picture of my swatches in the customer photos link under the image* There were a few designs that did not pick up perfectly, but that happens with Konad also and even though they weren&#x27;t perfect they were far from bad and I really dont think anyone but you would notice the imperfections. I did not think the edges of my plates were too sharp but I do agree with other reviewers that the full sized images can be bigger. These images plates have a wide variety of designs and you will be able to have a nail art for each holiday. I would reccomend these plates to anyone. These plates would be great for someone who just starting stamping, or for someone experienced to add to their collection.  This was definately the best purchase I made all year and I hope Bundle Monster continues to come out with new designs!</li>
    <li> I was super excited to receive this in the mail because I love Konad but the brand name plates are insanely expensive. So I came across  this Bundle Monster set and looked through the reviews. I thought it was too good to be true that such good quality could come from something so cheap, and boy was I right    The plates came in one thick stack in a plastic bag inside a mailer. They were not separated by any protective plastic or papers or anything, much like a stack of new mirrors would come packaged. They were just all in one big stack of plates. I tried peeling at the plate, hoping some protective plastic would peel off.    I grabbed some special polish, applied it to the design and tried to stamp. When I scraped off the excess, hardly any polish remained in the plate, and it didn&#x27;t go smoothly. When I scraped it down, it sounded like it was being scratched. I looked at all the plates before using, and they were COVERED in thick, nasty scratches, as if someone took sharp rocks and scratched up the plates.    Either I didn&#x27;t receive a new set, or they were damaged by scratching against each other in transit. Even the plate on the top was scratched, so it couldn&#x27;t have been scratched by another. I am very VERY disappointed. I have always gotten good products from Amazon, but this was not one of them.    I never return products cause it&#x27;s too much of a hassle, but these aren&#x27;t even in good enough condition to resell, so I went to Bundle Monster&#x27;s storefront page to see their return policy. I don&#x27;t mind paying for shipping for it to be returned, but if I am charged a crazy restocking fee, my bad review will stay on here. I will delete this and write a good review if BM isn&#x27;t a pain in the butt to return or exchange this item.</li>
    <li> The plates are really easy to use and there are many cute designs. Works well with regular nail polish. Great buy!</li>
    <li> So just like everyone else said. . . the whole nail images are too small to fit on you entire nail (unless you are 5 years old). But all in all it is a really good deal.</li>
    <li> I got these quickly and they are great...yes they are only slightly , almost imperceivably, thinner than the Konad plates, maybe it&#x27;s not so much the thickness as the type of stainess steel they use..Konad&#x27;s seem to be slightly more rigid, less apt to bend or dent the plate, but both brands of plates should be cared for and used gently, it can happen to either brand. Maybe they have improved their processess but I didn&#x27;t find the edges overly sharp or ragged, after all they are a thin piece of metal like the top of an aluminum can and it&#x27;s true, it&#x27;s possible, you could cut yourself on the plates but it&#x27;s not a toy and it&#x27;s more like a craft or makeup item and not intended for kids to handle carelessly. You wouldn&#x27;t want a toddler getting into glue or nail polish remover type of products either.&lt;br /&gt;As far as transferring the images goes I have only experimented a bit so far but had good luck. Just like the Konad plates there is a bit of practice and skill involved in applying the right motion and pressure to both the scraped imaged on the plate, to pick it up, and rolling it on your nail to transfer it to your nail nicely. Smearing of highly detailed images or skips in the image happens when not enough, or too much pressure is applied in both the plate and the nail stamping operations. Yes, work quickly for best results, yes, try different polishes, some work much better than others.&lt;br /&gt;As far as using the Bundlemonster plates their aforementioned, perhaps lesser quality, stainless steel makes them slightly more flexible. I found you couldn&#x27;t get a clean scrape when the plate was set on top of a mere double paper towel thickness on a table surface. The image would be smeary because you didn&#x27;t get all the excess polish off the image due to a very slight flex in the plate on the slightly poofy paper towels (this would be a huge problem on a regular cloth towel) and the plate . Maybe the plate holder would help but I found holding the plate down flat with your other hand while making the scrape does the trick. Also using an old cutting board or some kind of more solid surface would keep the plate absolutely flat for the scrape. Also the metal scaper, doesn&#x27;t flex at all so it doesn&#x27;t follow the slight flexing of the plate when you scrape. Try using a credit card or one of those really thin plastic rewards card from a store that will flex into the image as you scrape it. These slight adjustments to use the Bundlemonster plates, even though they are a bit lesser quality than the Konad, will transfer the more detailed images without smearing.while making the scrape does the trick.

    <li> I received my BM plates real fast and i love them!  The designs are great, and though the full nail designs are a little small,  they fit my nails perfect. Quality is amazing for this price.    I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this BM plate set because I just found out about nail stamping and looked into purchasing some plates. The konad plates were quite pricey for me and then I found these. I took a chance because most reviews were great. I am very pleased that I did purchase this set. I have used them and they work great. Since I have received them I have changed my nails/designs every two days. :-) I will be keeping my eye out for them to come out with another bundle! :-) Also I had to contact BM customer service and they were easy and pleasant to deal with!</li>
    <li> These are great for what I paid.  Shipping to Canada was also a good price.   My nails quite thin thin and they end just a sliver past the ends of my fingers.  The full design nail plates didn&#x27;t really cover my whole nail.  The french manicure plates worked so/so, but I hate french nails so I probably wouldn&#x27;t use them anyways.  The design plates work just as good as the Konad counterpart.  I&#x27;m happy to get a ton of designs that for a lot cheaper than Konad.  Konad is probably better if you want french and full nail designs, but these are definitely worth the money.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> These are incredible! Im still learning but after 3 tries starting to look professional! Getting heaps of compliments from people I know and strangers who want to know where I got my nails done! Although some of the full nail patterns i wish were slightly larger as my thumb nail seems to be strangely wide!!  I&#x27;ll def be buying more plates if they have them :)</li>
    <li> I love these plates, the service was great and the shipping was very fast. Everyone asks me where I got them and I tell them Bundle Monster.</li>
    <li> No review, I&#x27;m still waiting for my items. I purchased 1 month ago it&#x27;s impossible, I don&#x27;t know what to do</li>
    <li> I got my nail plates and they are great. I have a few of the name brand Konad nail art plates and they are exactly the same, but better. They have more designs per plate and they have a lot of different designs to choose from. They work just as well as the Konad plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest still using the Konad Special polish because like the Konad plates, a lot of regular store polishes don&#x27;t work so well with the stamper. Metallic nail colors of any brand work well. Also, you can make your nail polish thicker by placing it in the fridge, so that will also help with getting the image to transfer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have wide nail beds you&#x27;ll have to improvise on the full nail designs because they aren&#x27;t as wide as the Konad plate versions. I only have issues with my thumb and i&#x27;ve fixed it by just putting polish on half the stamp and doing the part that isn&#x27;t covered with the first stamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, The edges of the plates are kind of sharp, but you could probably take a metal file or dremel and file around the disc&#x27;s if it bothered you or you were concerned about it. They aren&#x27;t too bad and since I just set mine on a paper towel I don&#x27;t notice except when i&#x27;m putting it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They all come with a protective wrapping on them so MAKE SURE YOU REMOVE IT before trying to stamp. it&#x27;s plastic and i just used my nails to get it to come up off the plate for stamping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is amazing and the amount of stamp designs you get is awesome. It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> i bought the shanay cosmetics plates from amazon as well as these thinking that i would have a ton of stamps to choose from. these are the exact same with less plates, but cost more than shanays!! I am returning.</li>
    <li> I was a little turned off about how small the items were. They looked larger in videos and picture. Also the sides of the plate are very jagged and sharp so I would suggest wearing gloves when using. Otherwise, I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised to see the plates and also cheaper in large quantities. I bought some Konad plates and I confess that I love these monster bundle plates. They are easy to use and the designs are awesome!  I recommend it!  [[ASIN:B003ILUQPM Bundle Monster Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates Accessories Set Kit 21pc]]</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite nail-related purchases. It&#x27;s a great deal, and you get so many cute designs! As other people said, some of the designs aren&#x27;t carved perfectly, and the full-nail patterns are too small for my thumb nail. That being said, you&#x27;re getting these plates for a little over a dollar each! Konad brand plates are about five dollars a plate, so it&#x27;s worth it to buy these ones. A great way to start out your nail stamping kit. If you buy this, be sure to get a stamper and scraper, as well as Konad brand stamping polish. It&#x27;s the only brand that will show up perfectly clear when used with stamps.</li>
    <li> smaller than konad but the quality is the same. Edges are a bit sharp [cut my finger] so be careful, pop them on some kitchen towel to use them. Loved them, the quantity for the price is amazing, i would recommend them. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I saw that a few people complained about &#x27;scratches&#x27; on the plates, but that is just the thin protective film that covers them. Just gently scrape at the edge of the plate (GENTLY b/c these plates are sharp!) and you will see the plastc film start to come off. The only reason why I didnt give it 5 stars is because the edges of these plates are very sharp and you have to always be careful how you pick them up. Also, a few of the designs with smaller details (for example the peacock, or the flowers) are harder to see after they have been stamped. It also depends on what kind of nail polish you are using (how thick the texture is and the color). Your best bet is to experiment by pairing up a few of your favorite nail polish colors to see which ones the designs work with. Overall I really like this!!</li>
    <li> this is such a super deal.i dont know why any body would not give it 5 stars.i used to order konad image plates.i wish i would have found this sooner i could have saved allot of money.at first when you see the plates you see allot of scraches but when you take the foil off they are in a very good condition.i tried them right a way and they work very good.and the shipping wow it was super fast.thank you so much.will always order from again :)</li>
    <li> Delivery in minimum time. Plates as i wanted them, the only thing is that the designs that are supposed to cover the whole nail are way to small.. Don&#x27; t cover the entire nail surface..</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this order. I read the negative feedback; however it did not keep me from purchasing this product---and I am glad they did not.   There are many designs to choose from and they work just as well as Konad ( I have a few plates by Konad). The images are no smaller than Konad images. Each image that I tested did well. I used Konad nail polish (do not know of any polish brand that works acceptable each time with plates at this time). Being that I purchased these plates at a bargin :). I will purchased more Konad polish to use with both sets of plates.  If you are thinking about buying this set, Buy it.   Between me, my 9 year old and teenager there are designs for each of us.    My only regret is not buying it sooner.</li>
    <li> These are great! I would recommend to any nail artist. the variety is amazing, Some of the designs were a littler weird but I only use the ones I like so it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> Bought this set of nail plates, and started trying out my Konad stamper and scraper with them. Seeing as how it was the first time I&#x27;d ever attempted to use these, it was a little tricky at first, but got a lot better after repeated practice. The plates work perfectly well as long as you know what you&#x27;re doing. My only gripe is that the size of the designs are a little too small. I have small nails but the designs don&#x27;t cover all of my thumb. I can only imagine how these stamps turn out for people with larger nailbeds.  One nail plate arrived damaged, but the seller sent out a replacement right away as soon as I contacted them, so kudos to the seller.</li>
    <li> yeah, it was pretty much a good bargain than the konad ones for its cheaper price, but if you have bigger nails like mine, it would be a problem. The design plates where a bit smaller the konad ones (notice that bundle monster&#x27;s had 6 while konad&#x27;s had 4 - I&#x27;m talking about the full nail designs). i guess these plates are intended to use for small-sized nails, perhaps for kids. Also, i guess that the reason why they sell them with the clear sticker on, is because the plates doesn&#x27;t have that great aluminum quality and it get scratches on so easily. The sides where sharp unlike konad&#x27;s.  But i guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> There are so many amazing images and unlimited possibilities.  There are some really cute ones that would be perfect for Halloween, Christmas, and other holidays.  I will definitely be using this for years to come! Make sure you are careful with the edges, I cut my finger taking off the clear plastic the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> OMG!!!!This actually works!!!i love them and use them every time!It even works with my regular nail polish (at least some of them).I don&#x27;t ike all of the designs but there is a large choice.It is a buy you won;t regret!!!</li>
    <li> Great price,great images and fast service!   Much better than spending $7 plus on Konad plates. So recommended!!!</li>
    <li> I love these plates! I have so much fun mixing and matching so many plates for such a low price! The only thing wrong with these is that they don&#x27;t cover the full nail. It just causes me to be creative with the rest of the nail. I think they work just fine with the special polish. Have fun!</li>
    <li> I would shop here again ! fast shipping, great packing, great product and great price, did I say this seller is great ?</li>
    <li> I like more this set than the new one, but this has smaller images and can&#x27;t cover all my nail!!</li>
    <li> I am a Konad stamping newbie... be that as it may I am in love with this!!   I have received all 21 pictured pieces from Bundle monster.(7/17/2011)    Love all the possibilities and the designs!   I am so happy to save money and time not going out to get my nails done!  I use this on my natural nails.  My initial jump start fizzled pretty quickly and I become frustrated.   So I got my tush in gear and educated my self via ala You tube!! Once educated the difference in using this product was night and day.   Make sure you watch some tutorials people!!   As of now I am waiting on my order of the Konad special nail polish to try!!  In the mean time I am using the nail polishes I already own and so far they seem to work out. I found the darker the shade the better. Sally Hansen xtreme wear is working out for me.    Some tips...  Acetone nail polish a must  Have patients and a willingness to mess it up!  Apply polish to stamp plate and wipe off with scraper in one quick motion  Press the stamper into the design. Avoid the wiggle or roll. Use it like a dauber. One quick push straight down.  When applying to your nail be aware of the pattern direction  Must put top coat to protect that hard work!  Get creative with layers and glitter!  Most of all have fun!!</li>
    <li> i love all the images the plates came with but i have really long nails and they&#x27;re also wide. The designs were too small for my nails and it was hard for me to work with them due to the length of my nails (not a big deal, i can just file them down, but still). If you have short and narrow nails this should be great for you and a ton of fun!</li>
    <li> These work just the same as Konad plates. The only differences (and downfalls) are that the plates are thinner, not bendable but you have to be careful handling them; and the full nail designs are smaller than Konad&#x27;s, so depending on the size of your nail you may have to stamp twice for a full nail design, other than that they are great! Lots of cool designs, and about a dollar a piece, can&#x27;t go wrong. If only Bundle monster had special polishes too... :o)</li>
    <li> I love my new plates! So many designs to choose from!!! And priced at a great value!</li>
    <li> This product is great. I saw the videos on youtube and then decided to buy from Amazon. Now I change design on my nails every other day. And the prize is so cheap compared to the other places. Would definaley recommend this product from Amazon</li>
    <li> A great cheap set of plates. The quality is not quite as good as the original \\&quot;Konad\\&quot; plates but for such a big variety of images, it is completely worth getting these. The full nail images will be small for really long nails but they fit all mine fine except thumbs. When I got mine there was no backing on the plates so the edges were a little sharp but I hear that since then BM has started putting the backing on. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product about 2 wks ago and I just love it. So many plates and designs it is worth every penny!!!!! Wish they had more especially the larger designs.</li>
    <li> I love how there&#x27;s so many designs to choose from with all the plates. I think it was $17.99...? Of course I found some of the designs kind of weird but for the most part I love most of the designs. However just to warn everyone, the design aren&#x27;t as big as the regular Konads so if you have a wide nail bed then the \\&quot;entire nail design\\&quot; might not stretch over everything. The individual designs are fine since you don&#x27;t have to worry about putting it over the entire nail. Overall, great product!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! Great price for such a large amount of plates. Wide variety of stamps. I fine that these stamp quite a bit easier than the Konad brand plates. I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> PLEASE remove the plastic on top before using!! I cannot stress that enough! When using this at first, I though \\&quot;dang, this is horrible!,\\&quot; but really, I was the horrible one- I had forgotten to take the plastic covering off.  A tip for removing plastic covering:  Use the metal side of your scraper to peel off the side of it. Then, it makes it a lot more easier.  Also, the customer service is fabulous- there was a mistake and got two of the same image plates and one was missing- Bundle Monster allowed my to keep the extra one and is sending me the missing one. I thought that was pretty awesome!  AND another thing- I know at first they might look scratched and used, but you MUST remove the plastic covering- it will look better that way.  So, as said, PLEASE. Remember. To. Remove. The. Plastic. Covering. PLEASE!! It would make life so much more easier!</li>
    <li> This is such an excellent bargain, you really can&#x27;t beat it! The plates arrived in a very timely manner and they were well packaged. The plates are exactly the same size as the Konad brand plates and they are the same thickness as well. I mention this because I read some reviews saying the plates are a little smaller/thinner than the Konad plates, but they aren&#x27;t. They&#x27;re the same size. I&#x27;ve used several of the plates now and I love them. I do find that sometimes I have some trouble with getting some of the images to pick up on the stamper but the same is true when using the Konad plates. Sometimes just trying a different color of special polish seems to help with this - I have no idea why but it&#x27;s something I noticed. So if you have trouble getting one of the designs to transfer to the stamper, try a different color and see if that helps. I do agree with some of the other reviewers that the full-nail designs could be a little wider, I think they could be a bit longer too. The French tip designs could be wider, as well. But overall these are great, and the price is fantastic. I hope Bundle Monster is planning to make more plates in the future - I&#x27;d definitely buy them!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews but have used the Konad product for years and had no problems, so I figured I wouldn&#x27;t with these.  Wrong!  I tried 6 different plates, several designs on each and could not get even the smallest amount to transfer onto the stamper.  I was using my Konad polish and hardware.  I was so frustrated at this point that I switched the plate back to one of my Konad plates and had my nails done in less than 30 min.  I cannot recommend this product even though I really liked their designs.</li>
    <li> Great pack of Stamping Nail Art images plates for a very low price. I think that patterns are less detailed than Konad&#x27;s but they print very well on nails. I also find that patterns are too narrow to cover thumbnail. But I&#x27;m quite satisfied. ^^</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get these..    When I got them, they were much smaller then a thought. Alot of the prints aren&#x27;t ones I will ever use... how often will I need to put a lady bug on my fingers? I was looking for more flowers, and a french nail tip ones.     Also.. alot of the smaller detailed ones, even with konad special polish they are to small to work. No matter how fast you are.     I was into them, now and then. I don&#x27;t make it a regular thing I want to deal with though.</li>
    <li> I was so anxious to get these plates they had alot of images I couldn&#x27;t wait to use, and it was a great deal too! 21 plates! under 20 bucks! Amazing!!! The only thing that is a downer for me was I didn&#x27;t buy any of the special polish so I havent been able to use it yet &#x3D;[   I was more hoping my polish would just work. But once I get polish I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t be disappointed! One of my plates did get a scratch through the plastic though, when I saw it I was really hoping it was just on the film cover but when i pulled the film cover off it came off in two pieces so it was split and when I got the other piece off I tried cleaning but the mark was still there I can feel it too when I run my finger across it, so I&#x27;ll be contacting bundle monster and hope for a good resolution to the problem. &#x3D;]    So wanted to update my review. I emailed Bundle Monster about my plate and with no hesitation or hassle they are sending me a replacement for the plate that had a scratch! YAY!!!! Awesome customer service and an amazing product! Doesn&#x27;t get better than that!</li>
    <li> Not great like Konad plates but very good if you like nail stamping and want to have more options for a little money. Bundle Monster: next time please do the full nail designs bigger!</li>
    <li> Generally satisfied with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately stencils to cover the entire nail has a small size - it is not enough for my middle and index finger, so this estimate.</li>
    <li> I REALLLY love the bundle! its nearly perfect except for the size of the whole nail print which are kind of small. BUT considering the price i cannot complain.</li>
    <li> was sceptical on these, but after recieving couldnt wait to try. work just as well as konad discs, w/o the heavy price. more assortment on  designs too. just make sure you peel off plastic covering, and file edges from bottom out to keep from cutting yourself or child.(i used emeryboards from dollar store. these are great, cant wait to see if they come out with another set with more designs :)</li>
    <li> I just received this item about a week ago. I&#x27;ve been playing with it since. They take some practice but well worth it. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t get the Konad stampers as they are much more expensive. Get this bundle for a fraction of the cost. The hardest part is deciding which one you will use first.</li>
    <li> I love painting my nails and I was starting to notice on nail blogs people using stamping to add a fun touch. So, that&#x27;s when i decided to purchase this bundle pack. I&#x27;m still trying to get the hang of it, but I really like all the different designs.</li>
    <li> Not thrilled with the product.  Stamping the image is harder than it looks.  Many of the images are to large for little kids.  Doesn&#x27;t work with ordinary nail polish (to thin).  Must have to get konads or some other thicker polish.  Also you are limited with colors (because you are putting on on top another).      I am not a girly girl and don&#x27;t do my nails much, but I got these for my little girls.  I don&#x27;t think they will get much use out of the product.</li>
    <li> I ordered these plates on Dec. 3 and it was estimated that I would receive them no later than Dec. 14. They didn&#x27;t come and when I tracked the package they never moved. So I asked for a refund and received them and ordered the ones from Shany as they are cheaper and you get more plates. I received these quick but all of a sudden these plates come on Jan. 6. I contacted the company and they want me to pay to ship them back. This is crazy, they have inconvience me on many level. I would never order anything from them.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine showed me some Konad \\&quot;How to\\&quot; videos on youtube.  After watching them, I was so impressed, I bought two of these plate sets; one for my 16-year-old daughter and one for my 11-year-old daughter.  When we first used it, I was disappointed, the image wasn&#x27;t transferring well.  Then, I realized that we hadn&#x27;t removed the plastic film from the plates.  Now, they work great.  I would recommend this for anyone.  Great products.</li>
    <li> I know this isn&#x27;t Konad but for someone wanting to try out nail art stamping for the first time and not spend way too much money this bundle was great.  For $17.99 you get over 20 plates each having about 6 designs.  The designs range from huge block patterns that cover your entire finger or little designs like flowers or even a marijuana symbol which is random.  The edges are a bit sharper than Konad and some of the designs feel like they aren&#x27;t deep enough because the stamp doesn&#x27;t pick up the design right away.  Konad templates are about 6 bucks each so this is a super steal.  I can&#x27;t wait to get the Konad designs plates too. Its all super fun and pretty easy to use.</li>
    <li> For the price of three Konad plates you get 21 plates.  The full nail design plates are the big problem here. . . not enough to cover the full nail, but you can use them as patterned French tips, either straight across or on the diagonal for half a nail.  Just play around with it.  Read the reviews and I think you will agree. . . this may not be Konad and the etchings may not be as deep or well cut. . .and the full nail plates won&#x27;t do what they should. . . but it&#x27;s a great way to get your feet wet and even if you eventually get Konad plates, there are different designs here that Konad doesn&#x27;t have.  It&#x27;s definitely worth the money for me and I&#x27;m having alot of fun.  There are some great pages out there which can tell you which ordinary polishes work well, and youtube videos to show you how to get designs where you want them . . . this is a fun world waiting for you. Come on in!  I especially like multimedia designs which use not just Konad stamping but also freehand nail art and rhinestones. See my image. . . just my first try!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love using these nail plates. I have such fun with my niece who is always after me for new designs.</li>
    <li> The designs are diverse and the system is simple to use. I will never buy another Konad plate again. I really do agree with the other reviewers. BundleMonster needs to make more plates!</li>
    <li> i really have nothing bad to say about these plates. i had bought a konad set for my little sister for christmas i paid $40 for it. It came with 3 bottles of nail polish the stamper and scraper and only 4 plates. i puchased mine for half that price with the scraper and stamper but with way more plates. you can really use any nail polish at all the darker colors work best but the nail polish can&#x27;t be to watery it wont stick. for the best results you have to work fast and patient, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t come out quite the way you want it to. If it doesn&#x27;t then just lightly wipe it with cotton and nail polish remover and try again. the only real hard part is picking 2 colors you really want and a design :-)</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Please be careful of the edges as they are very, very sharp. I got my purchase quickly and found it was packaged very well. I am happy with my purchase!!</li>
    <li> I love these plates!  I just got them in the mail either yesterday or today, but I used some of the plates today.  I eventually stopped playing around and used the hounds tooth image for the tips of my nails.  It came out great!  I thought that there was a upload button so that I can show a picture of how they came out, but there isn&#x27;t, so I&#x27;m sorry...I guess you need to purchase the plates to see how great they will work for you!  I already get compliments on my nails (real and long until I decide to cut them; not fake), and I know I won&#x27;t be able to stop the kind remarks now!  I&#x27;m letting all of my friends know about this so they can start to do their own nails.  I do have to give Konad some credit, because if I didn&#x27;t hear about them first, I wouldn&#x27;t have done research on them and get some of their products, which in turn, pointed me into the direction of Bundle Monster.  I hope that this company makes other plates like Baby Phat, Playboy Bunny, dollar sign, Hello Kitty...You know...Just other designs that can be recognized at the drop of a dime and others that are nice as well.      Thank you BM!!!  I will be purchasing items from you again.</li>
    <li> Love this bundle of stamp plates, something for everyone here. Excellent value compared to buying each plate separately at my local store.</li>
    <li> SOOO many designs to choose from and extremely valuable! I absolutely love this kit! And the shipping!? It got to me in 3 days after processing!! Great stuff, great value, awesome quality and great customer service and amazingly fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a present for my little sister. She opens them up and all we see are scratches all over the plates. I did think getting 21 pcs for that price was great, but the scratches make the quality bad. I am just disappointed in the plates because of all the scratches.</li>
    <li> Bought this prior to Christmas for my two teenage daughters who love to paint their nails.  It cost much less than Konad plates and they are enjoying a wide choice of designs to choose from.  It was a great deal and the shipping was super fast!!!  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> They are very easy to use and they turn out so cute as long as you use thick nail polish.  The striping polish will work in a pinch too.  But here is a reason not to throw your old product away!</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant to buy this with some of the reviews but it worked really well!    I think the issue may have been that you need to peel the plates first.  Also, as some have mentioned, the edges do feel kind of sharp, so be careful with that.    Other than that these are an awesome price, especially as compared to the konad plates.  A lot of the designs were really cute and original. Some were a bit \\&quot;meh\\&quot; but that&#x27;s just a question of taste.    Awesome deal for some really nice plates!</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift from my hubby and I LOVE it! You have so many designs to chose from and they work great! I use regular nail polish but the thicker the polish the more it&#x27;ll show, of course, and these plates work just as good as Konad so it&#x27;s really a great deal especially considering the price! With this set, your options for designing nails are LIMITLESS!</li>
    <li> Incredibly fast shipping, I&#x27;m very pleased. As for the product, you can&#x27;t beat the price for 21 plates! I was apprehensive about the phrase \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; BUT this is an exception. The plates are made of very good quality polished metal. The designs are all interesting and pretty, it makes it hard for me to pick which one every time. This is a Konad dupe. The only difference is that the Konad full nail designs are wider so it covers the entire nail but that&#x27;s not a problem, just match up the rest if u have to. That&#x27;s the only possible con. I personally don&#x27;t mind at all when I remember the bundle I got for a fraction of the cost. I would of only had 2 konad plates and a stamper for this price :)</li>
    <li> I bought this product with all the negative feedback in mind. Now that I have received the product I can confirm that not all images are good. The plates are thin, but I didnt find them dangerous like some say. This feedback is base only on 3 plates I tested. As of yet, only 3 images out of about 21, (7 in each plate) successfully transfered. I was dissapointed, mostly cuz the one plate I wanted the most happend to be the one where ALL images were not transferable. &#x3D;( Then again,you get what you pay for. I do consider this an ok buy. It is 130+ designs. If I can get at least half to work, I&#x27;ll consider it worth the 18.00.</li>
    <li> Bought this despite the mixed reviews. Was going to return them because the full nail designs barely cover my pinkie much less any other nail. But the other designs work well and for 18 dollars it&#x27;s not worth returning if you can get some use out of at least a third of the designs. If you have wide nail beds or somewhat long nails you will lose the use of about 5 plates or more. The only other issue I have is that the designs are just okay. Wish they had more flowers. But not bad for what you pay for them.</li>
    <li> I had previously ordered MASH&#x27;s image plates, which I absolutely love and highly recommend, and was looking to expand my collection of images. This pack has wonderful, unique images and I&#x27;m excited to use them! My only complaint is that they look and feel cheaper than MASH&#x27;s plates. They seem flimsy. I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but the price is good enough that I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s worth it. Time will tell as to how well they hold up to painting and scraping! Either way, there are beautiful images here that I am excited to try!</li>
    <li> I was really stoked to get these.  But upon using them, there was a big gap at the top and the sides of my nails.  While the product works great, it&#x27;s not big enough for my entire nail.  It would be a nightmare to try to match up intricate designs like zebra or houndstooth to one another.  Definitely disappointed since the description doesn&#x27;t mention anything about the small size.  Hoping buying the real Konad product will solve this issue.</li>
    <li> I was not pleased with these at all.  They didn&#x27;t work.  Thank goodness I didn&#x27;t pay and arm and a leg for them.</li>
    <li> I bought these because i liked a lot of the pictures shown. IT&#x27;s not exactly what i received. I had about 4 duplicate plates of actual konad brand plates but the print was a lot smaller and the print was less detailed. There were some prints that just weren&#x27;t etched well so the print doesnt pickup at all. There are duplicate floral prints and there are also a lot of almost useless plates because the print looks like a giant blob and i have no idea as to what it is. With all that said there are some really good prints in these bundles and if you can get AT LEAST 2 good plates they have pretty much paid for themselves. Konad brand plates run for about 6.99 or so a plate so if you can find at least two or more plates that are good you&#x27;re golden. IF you&#x27;re expecting to get the exact plates of the pictures on here don&#x27;t get your hopes up. Over all I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> These are so much cheaper than Konad&#x27;s, and do the same exact job! Definitely recommend. I noticed a few reviewers said that they were sharp....we haven&#x27;t noticed, but my daughter is 15, so maybe wouldn&#x27;t be so good for younger ones??</li>
    <li> it came a reasonable time in the mail. very beautiful plates my daughter loves them and cant wait to try them! we are just waiting on the stamper to arrive and a great price for 21 plates.. she only wishes they came with a cheetah design (;</li>
    <li> Great product.  Received new as described.  Shipped fast.  Very happy.  Also bought more for teenage girls gifts.  They loved the gift.</li>
    <li> I originally  ordered the 21 plate set, knowing that the small full-nail images are only appropriate for small children&#x27;s nails or for the stamper who is really good at making two stamps match (the 25 piece is supposed to have helped this problem). I also read about other people getting damaged or misprinted plate images. Thus, the first thing I did was to check my plastes for size and damage. Yes,the \\&quot;rectangle\\&quot; images are small, though some would work if well-centered. I did find a dent in B08 that I knew would cause the images to stamp with flaws. I sent an email to customer support and figured I&#x27;d get a response in 24 hours (as I&#x27;d heard they had good customer service). Imagine my delight to find they&#x27;d responded within five minutes! AND, they&#x27;d already sent me a replacement plate! Assuming they hold up to their word, I&#x27;ll get it within 4-7 days. If I have further problems, I&#x27;ll amend this review, but for now I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I don&#x27;t expect any company or product to be flawless all of the time, but as long as mistakes are corrected, I have no problem.</li>
    <li> Great and responsible Seller...and selling at a very reasonable prize.   Plus...i received the items before the expected date.   Thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> i bought this plate last july.. it looks cheap.. designs shown is not the same design i got. you will realized it after u open the item when u can not return it. i was not happy about the design too some of them are the same design to other plates.</li>
    <li> I have three girls and thought this would be fun for us to have girls day.  I could not get them to work at all.   I am very disappointed in this item and do not recommend that you purchase this</li>
    <li> These plates are wonderful! The images are extremely crisp and nail polish comes off with hardly any acetone. The only downside is the edges of the plates are a bit sharp. I got my set yesterday and immediately sat down to try the designs. Worked like a charm along with the [[ASIN:B002MZ8BK2 Konad Nail Art Double Ended Stamper And Scraper]]. Will def keep buying image plates from this seller in the future!!!! :))  Just make sure you peel the blue plastic protective film before using the image plates :))</li>
    <li> Works great.  Do be careful of the sharp edges.  Great value.  Works well with Konad stamping polishes.</li>
    <li> I like all the designs i got but it is pretty hard and time consuming to use.  i have only used once since i bought them.  If you have time and patience this is a great buy.  I still have to invest in the Konad Nail Polish hopefully that makes it easier to use.</li>
    <li> I was quite impressed with the quality of the Bundle Monster nail design plates, especially for the price. They work well and I was able to create some super cute designs for my nails. The only thing I would change is the size of the full nail designs, they do not fit on my thumb. The manufacturer was perhaps too ambitious, trying to fit 6 full nail designs on 1 plate. This can be worked around with some creativity. Bundle Monster seemed to learn from their mistakes though, because the newer 25 piece set of plates has larger full nail designs. Over all, the product is awesome, and I would recommend these plates to everyone.</li>
    <li> These are absolutely great!  I bought them with very little experience in nail stamping.  I had only purchased ONE konad plate, and I didn&#x27;t want to purchase more, at $6 a pop!  so when I found out there were other brands, I was so excited!!!  I bought this set, and I plan on buying their new set soon.      They shipped SUPER fast!      I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the etchings being too shallow, like some others have, but I am not too happy about the size of the full designs.  I mean, if my nails were shorter, they&#x27;d be perfect, but I keep my nails pretty long, so the full designs don&#x27;t cover my entire nail.  But I&#x27;m sure with a little practice and some YouTube video searching, I&#x27;ll probably get the hang of matching up more than one stamp on a nail.  Also- I haven&#x27;t had any problems with nail polish. I just use whatever I have handy.  Though, the thicker your nail polish is, the better.  But there&#x27;s no need to go out and buy expensive brands or anything like that.      But definitely a great buy, considering this many brand name konad plates would cost well over $100!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this four days before I received it in the mail, needless to say the shipping time was super fast.  All the plates where very well worth the money paid for them and from the ones Ive tried, the designs come out crisp and clean with a little practice. Great stuff and I just purchased the second \\&quot;edition\\&quot; of them.  Would recommend for anyone who loves nail art and has some time to do it.</li>
    <li> A couple of the plates were scratched,but I suppose it was worth it for such a resonable price. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s so cute pictures and such a low price! And the plates are good quality also which is important of course &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I purchased the Konad  nail stamp a couple years ago and hid it!  Not till now I got introduced to Pinterest and found the wonderful nail designs used by these nail stamps.  Thank you,  It&#x27;s  beautiful and fun. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> She loved the idea of being able to do her own nails without having to go outside of her room. Thanks for the great idea of putting this together.</li>
    <li> i very very happy that i got bundle today..the design very very cute .  i think they Improve the plate .plastic cover is blue and easy pull off and the paper or sticker at the back..make it look nice..  after all i loveeeeeeeee they design ..  the plate a litter bit  scratches but no big deal. every thing else perfect..</li>
    <li> Easy to use and get wonderful results. Nice because it doesn&#x27;t leave a thick layer of polish so the design lasts longer on my nails.</li>
    <li> I must say i love this set..Its a great price and has so many cute designs. Delivered on time :) I will purchase more designs. I am extremely happy with the product(s)!!!!! :)</li>
    <li> For the amount of images and the cheap price, I thought this would be a perfect buy.  But in reality, I will be throwing them away, not only did i slice open my hand on the metal but none of the images stamp. I was not happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I recently received these as a gift from my boyfriend. I know how to use the nail art plates because I started off with konad. I cant get one image to show up on the stamp, and I wasted alot of my special nail polish trying to make it work. This product was a waste of money now I know to keep buying konad&#x27;s plates since they work way better even if they are more expensive. (I would give this 0 stars if it let me)</li>
    <li> I am having a tough time with the \\&quot;Bundle Monster Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates\\&quot; as the images are much shallower than the Konad brand and I can&#x27;t seem to get them to transfer out of the plates and onto the stamper. I am working really fast and still only partial images are coming onto the stamper.  I have had NO PROBLEMS with the Konad plates.  Thinking I might as well spend the money and be TOTALLY satisfied with the Konad plates.  Gonna toss the Bundle Monster plates ... they are too frustrating!!</li>
    <li> I paint my nails weekly and after so long you run out of colors. I was getting bored  with just plain painted nails so I bought the konad stamper and this set of plates.     These plates have some cute designs and they are easy to work with.  Other than the full nail designs, all the images  I used or practiced with came out just fine.  The full nail designs are just too narrow for me.  It&#x27;s a shame because there are some nice ones. I tried doing them  side ways then matching up and doing it again but that is not working for me.  If Bundle Monster comes out with more images  I&#x27;ll definitely buy again. These are well worth the price.  Hopefully the next set will come with a few larger full nail designs.</li>
    <li> I wasnt sure if Id like most of the designs but Im glad to say I like the majority of them. They (full nail designs) are a little smaller than Konad but since I have little fingers, it works out perfectly. I was hoping the snake skin design was in this set but no luck. The plastic was not difficult to remove but it didnt fit as snug to the konad nail plate holder, but it did fit. The plates are sharp but as long as you use the holder there are no issues of hurting yourself.</li>
    <li> When I first received these nail plates I was excited, until I started testing them out.  Not all designs tranfered to nails.  The full image plates are too small to cover a whole nail. The bundle monster plates are a good price, but considering how many do not transfer, stick with the brand name Konad plates, which are sizably larger and work much better.</li>
    <li> super fast! arrived well ahead of schedule. I have asked several times and in all the products arrived perfectly, but this time missed a plate.</li>
    <li> I purchased these plates thinking they would work like the konad plates and saves some money. I will never buy these again. none of the plates seem to work well no matter how fast I scrape them. I will be using my konad plates from now on.</li>
    <li> I bought this bundle to try out nail stamping for the first time with the Konad stamper, I&#x27;m really impressed with the amount of variety and the plates work fine as far as i know. Adds lots of fun to the typical painted nail!</li>
    <li> i love this because you get the most bang for your buck and i love the more updated stamps tip* use a chrome polish  it looks the best</li>
    <li> These are the old models, images are small for entire nails.&lt;br /&gt;Some are good like flowers, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m keeping them but I like BM 2 better.</li>
    <li> These plates are just as good in quality as konad plates. The images are not fake rip off copies but unique and interestingly different and can&#x27;t be found else where. I enjoyed finding these as I was looking for plates which had more gothic designs then the usual 1,000&#x27;s of different flowers images that most other sets have. This set is 5 stars for value, designs, and quality. I highly recommend. Shipping was fast too and the plates were well packaged.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves the nail stamps. Great value with many cute designs for stamping. Purchased a Konad set and use the Konad scraper, stamper, etc. with the Monster Nail Art with no problems. Like others have said, don&#x27;t forget to remove the plastic on the disc.</li>
    <li> Hi there, the bundle monster i bought from amazon is as great as it looks in the picture,,lots of nice pieces with a suitable price.</li>
    <li> Product is good value overall.  Compares to Konad brand with exception that some  designs are not etched deep enough and don&#x27;t stamp onto nail completely.  Metal plates do not have soft paper/foam backing like Konad.</li>
    <li> I loved these plates. So many options for nail art. Very easy and fun to decorate your nails. I will ve ordering the new bundle plates!</li>
    <li> I received my bundle monster nail art plates 2 weeks ago and I am very satisfied with it. I tried most of the plates and I think its all amazing and works very good. I say it works better then Konad the only thing is that the full nail designs are bit smaller so whoever has wide nails, i don&#x27;t suggest you purchase this set unless if you want all the other small designs. i have very small nails so it works really good :D overall i think its the best product to buy and it&#x27;s affordable because Konad plates are 7 dollars each while these are bit less then a dollar for 1. I am so satisfied with this set of plates that I already ordered another set I should be getting it today or tomo. I am so excited cant wait till I try those out :)</li>
    <li> for the price and the amount you get, you can&#x27;t complain. there is a thin sticker you need to peel off before you can use the actual product. some of the plates/ images don&#x27;t work but a majority of them do &#x3D;) some full nail images are too small for the average size nail so you&#x27;ll have to try to work around that but other than that theres no problem. plates may be a bit sharp but i&#x27;ve havent had the problem of cutting myself yet.</li>
    <li> This is such a great deal. You get a ton of plates and you spend about 85% less than you&#x27;d spend in retail stores. Also, you get super cute and clean designs..unlike some \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; alternatives out there. For anyone who loves nail stamping or wants to start out doing so, this is the deal for you.</li>
    <li> This 21 piece kit gives you a great variety of shapes, full-nail patterns &amp; tip designs, including a few for each holiday. My only complaint is that a few of the images (including the one that I originally picked this set for) aren&#x27;t engraved deeply enough. This makes it borderline impossible to get the entire image to transfer. The vast majority of them are great though!</li>
    <li> So I got both set from bundle monster. Only after buying and using and then looking for more plates I realized that this are dupes, with some images not seen before, by me. I am over all impressed by by quality of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From this set I got,BM03 plate the images are not centered a couple of mm and the designs would have gone of the plate. It also is missing a peace. It looks like it moved during etching/engraving and cutting process. Since none of the designs on this place are ruined It not that big of a deal to me, but it dose this out to me because it like that. The BM10 is baddy scratched. I do not care for that design so it not that big of a deal to me. Lastly the full nail designs do not fit my thumb nails. How ever this also is not a problem for me because I like to keep my thumb, ring or middle finger nails as ascents nails, different deigns and/or colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cheap, great value.&lt;br /&gt;Wide chooses of designs.&lt;br /&gt;Clear image transfer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Full nail designs are too small.</li>
    <li> I love this set..... I am a nail stamping newbie and I cant speak to much on this subject as to say I went on youtube viewed many vids and this set along with few others were most used. So I came on here and ordered several the sets this bundle monster(BM) set I recieved today is amazing  I found this set to have the most french tip designs outa all the sets i ordered and had no problems peeling off the top blue protective cover and the edges are not as sharp as other plates and they have a special backign with is awesume.</li>
    <li> i am very pleased, great product i completely recommend this everything new unused still in the plastic the stencils work great</li>
    <li> I was looking to get some great nail art but didn&#x27;t want to pay $5+ for one, so I thought I would try the Bundle Monster. Although I did read some reviews about the stamps not being wide enough or deep enough, I was very happy with the designs! It takes some trial and error to get the stamps to fit your nails but it is well worth it. I am happy with my Bundle Monster Stamping Plates, and would definitely buy more from them! They also arrived well before the estimated shipping day, which was a bonus for an impatient girl who wanted instant nail gratification! Thanks Bundle Monster for the great Stamping Set and fast shipping and thank you Amazon for carrying these great shops in one convienient place!</li>
    <li> It is a great product. I am very happy with it. Easy to use. works well. Money well spent. No need to go out to get nails done anymore.</li>
    <li> This has alot of great designs but it did not work out for me. I dont believe in returning certain things, so i didnt return this. I&#x27;m going to try some konad ploish, i didnt want to pay for it because i already have a bunch of polish of great quality such as opi, essie, and sinful colors. ill have to figure something out</li>
    <li> My daughter loves them. Some images will probably never be used and they are sharp around the edges but worth the price. Thank you they are awesome!</li>
    <li> The price was beyond right when it came to this item!  I had priced out &#x27;Konad&#x27; Image Plates &amp; I absolutely refuse to pay the $7.99 + shipping cost for just one Image Plate.  Bundle Monster had the very best deal I could find.  You receive 21 Image Plates for $18.00 &amp; Free Shipping and since their reviews were great, I figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.  I really like the Image Plates &amp; although like some have stated about the image sizes for a Full Nail Image.  I have managed to fit together the images stamping them twice to get a Full Nail Image, not perfect but very useable.  So, these Plates are still the best bang for your buck!  If Bundle Monster ever is able to get any more in different Designs (hopefully full nail size) for the Image Plates, I will be back to purchase them as well! I highly recommend these as an outstanding Konad alternative!</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service, had problem with initial order which was sorted promptly. I bought the bundle mainly for the full nail images, they fit all my nails perfectly except slightly bit too narrow for thumb nail. Amazing price for the number of images and delivered to UK within a week.</li>
    <li> This is great! Great stamp set, cute designs, great for every situation. Nail tips, full nail designs, and little pictures. This pack has at it all, and at an incredibly reasonable price!</li>
    <li> I really like these and they work pretty much as good as Konad once you get the handle of it my only problems is they come a little scratched even after taking off the protective seal they are still a little scratched. Also some of the images are very under detailed. I find myself looking at a few of them and asking what the heck they are. But then again there are other ones that are over detailed (like the full image leaf one) when you try to stamp them they just come out looking like weird blobs. But the majority of them are pretty good. And the last thing I&#x27;m not happy about is how sharp the edges are. I have to store them between a bunch of paper towels so they don&#x27;t scratched each other even more. With Konads I can just put them on top of each other because they have the little cardboard backs that prevents them from scratching the others. But all in all they are definitely worth getting if you like the Konads.</li>
    <li> Plates are beautiful. Grand Designs, which should be across the nail, as it is for plates of companies Konad, are small and are suitable for French. But as a whole is very nice product. Include innovative design and I am so glad that you own    Romana</li>
    <li> Just I loved the nail stamp it&#x27;s very easy to do by yourself and you can find great price</li>
    <li> This is a great buy! Good selection of designs - my girls loved the Halloween plate! As others have mentioned, the plates have very sharp edges. Would love to see the edges rolled a bit so I don&#x27;t have to be quite so cautious when handling them.</li>
    <li> These plates were just as described.  I received them really fast and packaged very well.  They work great (remember to remove the plastic on the top or they won&#x27;t work).  The only downside to them is the edges are sharp - I think some sand paper can fix it easily (just can&#x27;t quit playing with them to try it yet! lol).    Can not wait for them to come out with more plates and designs.</li>
    <li> When I saw such a great deal typing KONAD on the search bar I was very exited with such a great deal, I&#x27;m in love with Konad and after you get use to the product it gets easier, but this plates ARE NOT THE REAL STUFF! The designs on these plates are smaller than the ones in the real product and they won&#x27;t cover the whole nail and that is if you&#x27;re able to get the whole thing on your stamper, because just half of the design will stick to it.... DON&#x27;T RECOMEND IT AT ALL  &gt;&#x3D;[</li>
    <li> Encontré la recomendación de estas placas en un blog de belleza ( El beauty blog de Eli) y desde que las compré estoy encantada con ellas. Es verdad que algunas imágenes no tienen la definición de Konad pero son geniales para tener variedad de diseños a un precio más que razonable. Además me llegaron una semana después de pedirlas. Recomendadas!!!</li>
    <li> I was very impressed. Then again I figured with my luck I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get it to work at all. Some designs work better than others but it&#x27;s ok only like 3 or 4 don&#x27;t work very well. And it might have just been the polish I was using. Anywho I&#x27;d recommend this to everyone. I&#x27;m already gonna get a few sets for family and friends as gifts.</li>
    <li> I love how many different designs are available! They&#x27;re not as detailed as some other famous brands, but they have so many choices and the cat is really cute! Besides you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I had never heard of Buddle Monster before, and I was really surprised with the products!    The price was fair to the products&#x27; quality. I&#x27;ve already tested them and loved them!</li>
    <li> I just used these plates for the first time today, and my nails came out great! I&#x27;m very happy with the variety of designs and the quality of the plates. The designs transfer very well from the plate to the stamper, and they are also easy to clean.     I&#x27;d bought a starter nail art stamping kit that only brought one plate and the stamper and was actually more expensive than this bundle! So this is a very good deal, and I wish I&#x27;d seen it before I purchased the more expensive kit.     Overall, extremely satisfied. The plates have designs that would go with a great variety of colors and also for lots of different occasions.</li>
    <li> This is such a good price for what your getting! the only thing is that you have to get the scraper and stamper seperately but its great otherwise and super easy!</li>
    <li> I am a consultant that sells konad stamping nail art products. After my first home party, (for my sister), one of her friends had the nerve to go online and check things out. Well, she found this monster bundle online and then posted on my sisters facebook page that I was ripping people off, that they were 17.99 + tax through amazon. So I went out on the hunt, and found them and here we are. Tho they have some amazing designs this is what I found WRONG with them (and not just cuz I sell konad!  1. I got cuts from the edges!  2. They have a protective film over them that leaves a residue in the designs.  3. The designs are not as sharp as konad.  4. The designs do not stamp very clear and only half the designs transfers.  5. The french tip and full nail designs are too small.  5. The designs are very rough, when u scrape over them its very bumpy and u have to scrape multiple times.  There, I think that&#x27;s everything! Just like the title says, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!</li>
    <li> This shipped extremely fast and I love all the diverse designs. It is a much better price than the name brand konad discs! I have never purchased the name brand because they are expensive and this had great reviews. I am pleased to see that they work great and have very cool designs. Even my husband liked some of them and was trying to find things to stamp for him! (they say you can stamp your phone, mp3, etc). They are sharp around the edges so please keep that in  mind if this will be used with younger children. I am 26 and was surprised by how sharp they are! So use caution when handling! The protective film is a little tricky to peel off since they cover it with film before cutting out the discs so again, be careful with those edges! A couple designs seemed a little repetitive - they were different but very similar but for the price I really can&#x27;t complain! There&#x27;s enough diversity that I really could care less!     I also did not purchase the disc holder that you see for sale on amazon. I think its unnecessary. I placed the disc on paper towel and it never slid around at all. And then clean up was much easier anyways since all the paint I scraped off went on the paper towel to just be tossed away when done. I also heard that I would need to clean the disc in between each stamp to ensure it would transfer correctly on each nail. I never did this and it worked perfectly every time. I only cleaned after ALL of my nails were done. The paint never got stuck in the disc (make sure you do it quickly or I could see how it might). At the end I just wiped it with nail polish remover and it looks like new! :)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s birthday and was completely disappointed that it doesnt work.  It doesnt matter how we do it, following the instructions very carefully, the polish wipes right off of the stencil.  It was a large waste of money and half of her birthday gifts are useless.</li>
    <li> plates BM16, BM19, BM20, and BM21, have images that do not cover the entire fingernail and they should! That is annoying. Other than that, the plates are good.</li>
    <li> I ordered this package on Monday morning and I got it Friday morning...I only got one duplicate disk I dont have my stamper yet so I cant say whether or not they work excellent.</li>
    <li> Got the order fast.. First i have trouble using the plates, but once i learn how to do it , its easy.. Now im even doing my mother inlaws nail with the design i got.. Thanks you so much!!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I first entered the nail stamping hobby. I LOVE bundle monsters nail plates. most of these reviews say that there are sharp edges and such, but BM changed the old set and the set i received has the paper backing now. I just ordered the second set from BM and i&#x27;m very excited for new patterns and larger images. MOST patterns stamp well but some patterns are etched too shallow, making it difficult to stamp. This does not deter me from ordering again. I have a few konad plates, however the price is what prevents me from going back to konad. BM is amazing. well worth my money.</li>
    <li> The product itself seems to be decent. I&#x27;ve never used or seen how nail stamps work. (I purchased them because they just looked interesting. I came across them while searching for other \\&quot;stuff\\&quot;.) Because I&#x27;ve never seen or used nail stamps, I did not realize there were other tools needed. Also, the stamps didn&#x27;t come with any instructions...it appears the seller just assumed everyone knew what nail stamps are and how to use them.I had to use \\&quot;google\\&quot; to search for instructions which led me to \\&quot;YouTube\\&quot;. There, others created and posted instruction videos. These videos were very helpful. This is where I learned I needed the others tools. Now I&#x27;m waiting for those to arrive, then maybe I can actually use the product that I purchased and could then make/give a more informed review.</li>
    <li> My order arrived super quick and in good shape.  I was thrilled with the plates.  They were exactly like the Konad brand just less expensive.  I plan on purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> These are not like the konad plates.  Don&#x27;t get them. You&#x27;ll be disappointed!!! I bought the monster bundle thinking I was getting a good deal.  Tried to use it at home and it didn&#x27;t work.  I thought it was my technique.  Then I realized the product was defective.  My friend has the konad plates that say KONAD on them and they work great and application is simple.  Now I realize the plates that I have  are  worthless.</li>
    <li> Very good product. The price was reasonable. Arrived in a timely matter. I would definitely recommend this product to friends who were interested.</li>
    <li> As a first set of stamps these are really good, there are a wide selection of designs and the image plates are good quality.  These are a great alternative to the more expensive but very similar Konad plates.</li>
    <li> All around great service. It was my first time using Amazon, and I will def. use it again!   Bundle Monster was fab...QUICK, NO HIDDEN FEES!...exactly what I wanted :)</li>
    <li> I LOVE Bundle Monster! Everything I buy from bundle monster is exactly as described and is resonably priced! This plates are just as good as konad plates and way cheaper (price wise)</li>
    <li> It came a day earlier then stated which made me super happy! I have ordered the other set from bundle monster as well and I am just as please with this order. One of the plates were not made properly and they said they would send me another one in a few days- as long as they keep their word- they are awesome and so are the plates!</li>
    <li> Product was delivered quickly and in good quality. I received my bundle monster nail art plates and I am very satisfied with it. The designs are definitely interesting. I did find a dent in  plate that I knew would cause the images to stamp with flaws. I sent an email to customer support. Already sent me a replacement plate!  I don&#x27;t expect any company or product to be flawless all of the time, but as long as mistakes are corrected, I have no problem.   Super Seller!!! Can&#x27;t wait to order more. Pozdrawiam z Gdyni. Urszula</li>
    <li> I love the variety of images in the stamping kit &amp; I enjoy being able to do my nails at home.</li>
    <li> THEY ARE SO EASY  TO USE AND THERS ALL DIFFERENT SO I  HAVE MANY TO CHOOSE FROM AN I LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> Very sturdy plates. Very excited to try this stuff out once my stamper comes in!! This is definitely a diverse bundle!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it works that well.  I&#x27;ve used it a few times but,  save your money and buy decals.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried different polishes and different images to transfer and just can&#x27;t seem to get it right. Do you really need those special polishes to get this to work right?&lt;br /&gt;Is there a special technique I&#x27;m not doing? Is it possible to put to much pressure on the scraper and scrape all the polish off?&lt;br /&gt;I need lots of help with these things.</li>
    <li> I recieved my purchase on time. I was somewhat happy&lt;br /&gt;with it a few of the plates were already scratched up&lt;br /&gt;but the ones that weren&#x27;t worked out fine.</li>
    <li> Theses where good had a lot of the same shapes and some of the shapes did not stamp on the nails completely over all ok.</li>
    <li> My order came in fast and the images look great! Already used with the konad polish and the images transfer great! Super cute designs... very happy!!!</li>
    <li> Good product.Wasnt able to found this product in my area, only online.Lots of choices of differents design.I like the productLots of choices.</li>
    <li> This set is fantastic. Konad is way too expensive and these are great quality just like the expensive ones. I tested each plate and all images come out crisp and perfect. Shipping was so fast! Best $12 I ever spent :)</li>
    <li> I&#x60;m quite disappointed in this set. The whole nail images are to small for my nails. And Im not a big hand girl. The single images are okay but wish the others were bigger. But these were made in 2010. Before they made them bigger. Because my other Bundle Monster sets are the perfect sizes. Anyways.. Going to keep them just for the small images.</li>
    <li> I bought these so that I could do my own manicure. They are great. It does take a little bit to learn how to use them. I got the hang of it after the fourth or fifth nail. The only real complain I have is that I wish some of the patterns were a little wider. I have pretty wide nails and I have to put two stamps on some of them. The stamps are easy to line up though, so this isn&#x27;t really a big deal. These are great if you want a salon manicure look.</li>
    <li> These are ok stamping image plates. The problem with them is that not all images works. I have tried stamping all different ways and still can&#x27;t get images to work. It&#x27;s a shame cuz there are some really cute images I would love to use.</li>
    <li> Every plate I&#x27;ve tried from this set stamps clearly and works great. Only con I have is that I did receive one set of doubles. The rest of the plates were all unique.</li>
    <li> these shipped much faster than estimated. They are sharp around the edges as some other people have mentioned. There are some nice designs, but many that I will probably never use. However, since you get so many for this low price, it&#x27;s still better than buying a few disks at a more expensive price to get specific designs. The full nail designs fit my fingers, just not my thumbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m glad I got them and would consider buying other sets.</li>
    <li> These plates are fun to decorate nails with. I have received a lot of positive comments when I use them.</li>
    <li> You get a lot for your money and it&#x27;s a nice gift for a girl.  Might be a good idea to buy Konrad nail art double stamper and scaper.</li>
    <li> These stamping plates are great. I wish there was a little more variety, there&#x27;s a lot of the same &amp;#34;themes.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Lots of variation and a good value for your money.  Plates are etched well.  Have had no problems picking up the images.</li>
    <li> I love this set because it has almost anything you can imagine! From flowers to stars to more. The only issue I had with some figures (not many) was the depth of the plate which makes stamping harder to transfer but overall, good buy.</li>
    <li> I like them very much.  They are nice and durable.  So many choices on each disk.  I was pleased with them.</li>
    <li> I loved these IP&#x27;s for the price. There are a lot of designs to choose from, however, the larger designs that are supposed to cover the entire nail fall completely short for me. They are no where near wide enough for us with larger nail beds. If they were just a bit larger, I would LOVE the entire set, however, they aren&#x27;t. I hope they consider this when/if they create new sets. If so, I would definitely buy from again and again!</li>
    <li> I been watching Konad nail stamping art videos forever. I been wanting a kit for a long time now, but since each KONAD image plate is like $6.99 I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to buy one. BUT when I found this I saw HEAVEN, lol. I was like, even if it doesn&#x27;t work (which was doubtfull since most people put good reviews) I wanted to try it since it was only $17.99 for 21 IMAGE PLATES.....AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! BUT THEY DO WORK! I thought about it too much at first, so I couldn&#x27;t figure it out. But if you watch a YouTube video on it, and do just exactly what you would do for a Konad image plate (as shown on videos, I wouldn&#x27;t know bc I don&#x27;t own any) then you should be fine! I used about 7 image plates already, they all work. I used the Konad stamper and scraper, and they work PERFECT. I also bought the white princess Konad special nail polish to use with this. LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!! SO CUTE!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this pack of image plates because the Konad plates are so expensive.  I wondered if the quality would be good, if the images would be deep enough, etc.  I shouldn&#x27;t have worried, these are great!      BE CAREFUL THOUGH!  The edges are sharp and I accidently sliced my finger while cleaning the plate.  Each plate comes with a thin plastic layer over the entire plate to keep the plates from getting scratched.      The only differece between these plates and the Konad plates are A) there is no paper backing stating where the plate is from and B) the full sized nail images are a bit smaller than the Konad ones.  Still, they should be big enough for most nails, as they fit my fine.  Longer nails (depending on the length) won&#x27;t be stamped in one stamp, as the images are only so big, however, the same can be said for the Konad plates as well.    All of the images are nice and clear.  There is a nice varity to them all.  I love that they include a Halloween plate and a Christmas plate, and there are lots of lovely flower and feminine designs as well.    I am SO happy I bought this BundleMoster pack!  If you have any questions about this plate or how to use it, etc., you can contact me on my blog [...] (I don&#x27;t want to give out my email address as I hope you can understand!)</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase, fast shipment overseas. I think it arrived within 2 weeks. The designs are great and great variety to choose from with its irresistible price. Wish the designs are slightly larger so can cover bigger nails. And that the edges of the plates are really sharp, so be careful!!!</li>
    <li> These plates work just as well as the pricer ones!! Good looking designs on plates.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of the quality of the bundle monster plates vs. the konads.  These plates are equal is quality but are so much cheaper!  They are a bit smaller than the konads, but I have small fingers to it&#x27;s great for me! :)</li>
    <li> JUST TRIED OUT MY STAMPS VERY HAPPY WITH THEM HAVING FUN WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT PATT. NEW TO THIS   NEVER TO OLD TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT..  THANK YOU MUCH GREAT PRICE..</li>
    <li> they usually sale each of the stamp plate for $6 or more...I got 21 plate for this awesome price! can&#x27;t believe it. The only thing is that the older plates I bought online come packaged individually and therefore after each us, I can put them back in the package safely  This ones come stacking on each on with a layer of protective plastic on each of them making storage a little more difficult .If you want to protect the plates, I suggest you put a layer of perhaps paper between them after removing the plastic protective layer</li>
    <li> I love this plates, they are very beautiful and they work perfectly.  I got them at home on the day that I was nominated, I loved the service, excellent seller.  Recommend this seller  Tk you</li>
    <li> I Love It  It&#x27;s Amazing ... Me &amp; My Sisters We Have A Small Nails &amp; BM Was So Perfect 4 Us  Big Thankx .. LOVE IT &lt;33333  But 2 of them are the same :/ .. but still love it &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> these are great for starters and perfectly priced ..   the other individual plates that i looked at are about $7 a piece.  so many different designs and very unique.  LOVELOVELOVE these</li>
    <li> These image plates are perfect. I bought one set, but my friends wanted it too, so I bought yet 2 sets and then 7 and I will must buy next 2 :D  Plates have very nice designs and my customers are very satisfied.  And shipping time ist very short. To Czech Republic 7-8 days..   Thanks for this item...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been told this company makes really great image plates... but the ones I received have NEVER worked for me.  Tried many different polishes and no designs ever came out.  Tried other brands of image plates with the same stamper and the same polishes and they work great.  Maybe I just got a bad bundle...?</li>
    <li> Lots of really unique and cute designs. Works great with any stamp polish.</li>
    <li> Grooves are of a good depth to trap polish into the designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that there are so many options to choose from, and that each disk came covered with a plastic film to keep them from scuffs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend slightly thick polish that is not so transparent so the designs show up on your nails. Do experiment with the polish you&#x27;ve got to see what combinations look best. Also, to minimize scratches, try using an old gift/credit card instead of the metal scraper that comes with most stamp kits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s great about using these is that it makes having patterns on your nails easier to do yourself, especially if you&#x27;re the kind of person that does better on one hand than the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The disks are borderline sharp, being so thin as they are. Definitely handle with care. Do not kung-fu grip these unless you plan on stamping with your own blood.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I invested in these plates, the only thing I regret is not buying these before i bought konad plates. These plates are wayyyyy better!!!!</li>
    <li> These were a super buy. You get alot of image plates and designs for the money. There are soo many different designs that are really cute . Easy to use too. The only down fall to these is that the full nail art designs or alot smaller than Konad image plates full nail designs...so they will usually not fit your whole nail unless you have really small nails. You can double stamp some of them though..that works.   I would defantly buy these if you are into nail art!</li>
    <li> Fun way to dec out your nails... The stencils work perfectly. The only downfall is that the edges are a bit too sharp</li>
    <li> Granddaughter and her friends love trying them all out.</li>
    <li> OK, so not all of them are my favorite, but, its a bundle, and I had a girls night a few weeks back and some of the ones I didn&#x27;t like my friends did. Defiantly worth the money for me.</li>
    <li> Some things are shallow and don&#x27;t stamp correctly but a lot of nice ones in this bundle</li>
    <li> The quality of these plates is better than some other off-brands I&#x27;ve tried.  However, they&#x27;re still not Konad quality.  Maybe one out of three images I&#x27;ve tried is messy, even after multiple attempts to stamp it \\&quot;clean,\\&quot; and with different polishes (including Konad stamping polish).  My biggest gripe is the size of the \\&quot;full\\&quot; nail designs, they only fully cover my pinkies.  If it wasn&#x27;t for that, I would give these 4 stars instead of 3.  But for the price it&#x27;s a nice set to supplement a few pricey Konad plates.</li>
    <li> I bought the Bundle Monster image plate set as my first attempt at stamping nail art. I had wanted Konad for ages but didn&#x27;t want to pay the price for their plates.  This is a great value and all the images I have tried so far have transferred great and with ease. Make sure your base coat has completely dried and stamp firmly to guarrantee complete transfer of the image. I highly recommend this product and it was packaged well and delivered fast.</li>
    <li> There are 21 image plates with great pictures. Transport was perfect and very fast. But there are two points to think about when you want to buy these: first de egdes of the plates are pretty sharp so you have to be carefull. second on some plates are already, deep, scratches so these lines will come with the picture when you want to stamp. I don&#x27;t mean the scratches you get after working with them, but real scratches as deep as the images itself. Would I buy it again or recommend it to someone. Yes I do, but don&#x27;t have very high expectations of the quality and be careful when you pick it up.</li>
    <li> This was such am awesome value. I bought my daughter a Konad starter set for Christmas and with only 2 plates she was limited on designs. These came and were perfect!! I removed the thin plastic film on top right away and we have been stamping ever since!! So glad we found this!!!</li>
    <li> I got these plates for Christmas after raving about konad to my aunt. She decided to find something much cheaper then konad cause their plates are 6.50 each. After I received my plates i was ecstatic and ready use them for my nail art designs. Unfortunately none of my polishes that i have worked on them, I even purchased konad&#x27;s special polish to if that worked but it didn&#x27;t. So now i have 21 image plates-all useless. My thing is if your going to make the plates why didn&#x27;t Monster Bundle make their own special polish? That didnt make any sense,Im not going out to get more polish to see if it works cause if it doesn&#x27;t then that will be more money wasted. I try it again later to see if works but im still very upset.</li>
    <li> The plates are good.  Only problem I have come across is that the images are not large enough to transfer over the entire nail thus leaving gaps on the sides... Other than that, their good...</li>
    <li> A good variety of patterns. Easy to use, can easily be used with konad stamp. Very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This is super duper cool i love it. if you love getting your nails done and hate taking for ever using a tooth pick and some nail polish definetely buy this stuff its great. I didnt know what it was till i youtubed it and wow its so cool and so useful. i think every girl should have this. There is a huge variation of designs you get and i tried using other nail polish beside the conad one and it works just fine. its great and i five props to who ever invented this stuff.i think you get what your paying for with this product and i love it and cant live without it. at school people ask me where i get my nails done and i&#x27;ve been telling everyone about these nail art plates and how they are so easy and amaizing. my personal favourite is the one the has zebra and cheetah print on it, its super dope i love it. i would recommend this product to any girl out there older that 13 because one of the tools is like a blade thingy and its dangerous for kids. but im 16 and i know how to handle it fine and never gotten hurt or anything. The shipping was fast and safe all my things made it ok and new. Amazon it the way to go when you want something online. it great. i will keep raving about this stuff cuz its good for real im not lying its awesome and sooo helpful, way better than buying little jewelery for you nails or stupid stickers that fall off. i would recommend this product and buy it again if i had too.</li>
    <li> I definitely recommend the purchase it is worth it, all the plates work and they were pretty cheap, my problem is that the design for the entire nail are too small for some of my nails.</li>
    <li> This is my first foray into stamping and I was very happy to come across this package. The plates are varied enough, there is at least one image on each plate I know I will use. The cost compared to other plates is a huge plus.</li>
    <li> Super cool. Had all 21 pieces- all the plates had a protective film that you remove before use. Overall the designs are cool except there are quite a few that are pretty outrageous (several crowns, lips, cats) and other designs didn&#x27;t copy over very well (design had too small details that don&#x27;t copy over).  But designs that do work and are cool- Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Not happy with this at all! I though they were going to at leat cover my whole nail, the desings were really small, and only some of the desings actually work! Eventhough  would try to work fast so it wouldn&#x27;t dry on some of them I just couldn&#x27;t get them to transfer onto my nail. I was very disapointed because I was really excited about the product that is why I chose this one that had several pictures and variety.</li>
    <li> I started with Konad &amp; love it.  Seen some of Bundle Monsters designs stamped on FB &amp; wanted to try them for myself.  Awesome price!  Got my plates  before estimated shipping date.  Somewhat disappointed.  Can&#x27;t pick up the spider web image at all.  Some of the designs are not clear or too bulky.  The French designs don&#x27;t fit my thumb.  Designs are unique though.  Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll try the next set or not.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item at the beginning of March and received it Yesterday....not bad for a not sign for shipment! Good quality and nice range of images...reccomended</li>
    <li> If you are considering purchasing Bundle Monster, I would urge you to reconsider.  Firstly: the patterns for the nail art are not big enough to cover the whole space of your nail. For me, I don&#x27;t have acrylics I have natural nails kept quite short as I play guitar, and the pattern still doesn&#x27;t cover the whole surface of my nails.  It IS good though if you are looking for smaller designs that don&#x27;t cover the whole nail, such as flowers, symbols etc. This pack has many smaller designs.  Plus, the backs of the image plates are not sealed like other nail art plates.. so they are quite sharp and if you have children I would be careful where you store them.</li>
    <li> I just want to add a note: I received my set today, and they are now putting the backing on the plates that they brought in with the second set. If you were holding off on ordering this set for that reason, it&#x27;s fixed. Lots of gorgeous designs, and I&#x27;m looking forward to buying the second set too.</li>
    <li> These plates are a nice addition to the second set of 25 plates and the MASH plates.  They do not have any backing on them which make them sharp.  Also they are not as wide as others have mentioned.  They have fixed this in the second 25 piece set.  I got this set because I felt it would help flesh out the collection I already have and I am happy I purchased them.    The company that sells these are very helpful if you have a plate that is damaged or a favorite image that just wont pick up no mater what polish you use.  They have replaced two of the 25 piece set for me no questions asked.  For that reason alone I encourage everyone to purchase both sets.  So far the images I wanted to use have worked in the second set so I have not needed to contact them, but I am confident that if I do they will reply quickly as they always have.    When they put more plates out I will buy them :)</li>
    <li> This Bundle Monster is great i love the images, but i hate the whole nail images only cover part of he entire nail. Other than that they are great to own.</li>
    <li> Lots of plates for one great price, some plates have odd images that I&#x27;ll probably never use. Also some images are hard to pick up like they made the image indentation too shallow.</li>
    <li> Very few patterns, fit on the nail,  there is only one disk with holiday  figures on it,  You get what you pay for !</li>
    <li> i love that there are so many designs and i bought this separate from the stamper and scraper and it was so worth it and affordable, you can make so many combinations and they are easy to find on youtube to practice. it does take some time to learn how to do it correctly but overall the product works great it cleans easy. if children are going to use these just supervise them because the edges are a little sharp. i was so exited when i got them because there are so many, and shipping was quick and none of them got damaged. just remember to pull the blue plastic off before use and practice, practice, practice!!! :)&lt;br /&gt;i also bought Bundle Monster Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates Accessories Set Kit 25pc and these two came together they are awesome!!</li>
    <li> The price it was good ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok okok okok  ok ok</li>
    <li> These plates have patterns on them that are too small to cover the nail. They are smaller than the regular Konad plates. The French tips do not cover the thumb nail and I had to stamp the nail two times from different directions. The full nail covers can only cover my pinkie and right finger. The rest I had to stamp two times. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great price for so many single images and is a great starter kit.</li>
    <li> Item arrived very fast (only 7 days to Melanesia) and I was very happy to see the quality for this cheap price !  I warmly recommend this seller ! It will be better he sells the stamp with the plates, just a little suggestion !!</li>
    <li> These plate are awesome, after removing the film that covers them I can&#x27;t believe how nice the design looks on my nails. It takes some practice, but they are worth it. Konad is more expensive and no different than these. You wont be sorry great price great quality. I love mine!</li>
    <li> You can not beat the price on these plates. This is a great way to start stamping. You do need to peel the thin film of plastic off the plates.  It is hard to get off but once you do these plates stamp great. The full nail designs will not fit the whole nail but on young children or teenagers who have small nail beds the design will fit their nail. Unlike the konad plates the edges are sharp and you need to be careful not to cut yourself especially when peeling the thin film off. I have both these plates and Konad and they both stamp about the same. I would definitely recommend purchasing these plates. I was definitely happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> the qualities can&#x27;t compare to the real konad plates as the images do not fit the entire nail. The price is very cheap, however, and definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my lady and she thinks they are awesome!  She makes really nice designs and I like the fact that she does them at home instead of the salon.  This purchase has already paid for itself many times over with the money saved.</li>
    <li> i love these there a great price &amp; work well you just have to hurry befor the nail polish dries  because then they dont stamp on your nail but there a great buy</li>
    <li> i love these, so much cheaper than other brand and the same thing . they are sharp on the edges but you can use a nail file to soften. i leave the plastic layer on the top and just peel up one edge to use and after put it back on,it keeps them from scratches.  when using you have to clean almost every time and make sure you clean your nails with alcohol they work better that way.  i wrap in bubble wrap and store in small box.    i hope you  make other sets will buy them all  thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these for almost a year but I haven&#x27;t used them that much--there are a select few designs that I use regularly, but the majority have remained untouched. Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;-A lot of my plates came damaged; maybe I&#x27;m just the unlucky one in a thousand, but many had imperfections in the metal that ruined the images. Other than that, the undamaged plates worked decently. You might run the risk of having damaged plates like me, but I&#x27;m guessing this was just my bad luck. Can&#x27;t really blame the company since I never made the effort to return them, and it&#x27;s been waaay past 30 days (at the time I was just happy I got them).&lt;br /&gt;-I liked that there were themed and matching stamps, but to be honest I just don&#x27;t like a lot of the images enough to actually use them. There is an unnecessary amount of tribal/swirly images, and what were they thinking with the ambiguous pair of chili peppers? Take a good look at the individual images and take that into account more than the sheer number of plates. Will you actually use them?&lt;br /&gt;-Unless you have child&#x27;s hands, the full-nail plates are waay too small--it&#x27;s most noticeable on the thumbs and middle fingers, but they can barely fit over any of my nails (in terms of width, not length--I don&#x27;t have crazy-long nails). To avoid awkward-looking nails, I haven&#x27;t used many of the full nail stamps. Images like the polka-dots are easy to align and restamp, but others not so much.&lt;br /&gt;-They come off a little blurrier than Konads, but nothing too horrible&lt;br /&gt;-Some of the images are nice in theory, but don&#x27;t show up that well once stamped. For example, there&#x27;s a cute lace french tip that I just couldn&#x27;t get to work because it was impossible to pick up the full image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side:&lt;br /&gt;-they&#x27;re cheap, and most of the images are pretty crisp&lt;br /&gt;-A lot of the full-nail designs have matching french tips&lt;br /&gt;-The french tips will definitely (probably) fit over all your nails, including thumbs.&lt;br /&gt;-I like the themed plates--for example, there&#x27;s a Christmas one and a Halloween one.&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;ve heard complaints that these plates were too sharp, but I don&#x27;t see how you could accidentally hurt yourself with them--maybe they&#x27;ve updated their plate design?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I haven&#x27;t used many of the images, those I do use make the bundle worth it. The total price for all 21 image plates--damaged and unattractive though some may be--is the price of 3 Konad stamps. It&#x27;s definitely worth the price, but I can&#x27;t guarantee amazing quality.stmas one and a Halloween one.   -I&#x27;ve heard complaints that these plates were too sharp, but I don&#x27;t see how you could accidentally hurt yourself with them--maybe they&#x27;ve updated their plate design?

    <li> I would say these are pretty much what I expected after doing some research on nail art stamping. They are pretty small, but they&#x27;re as big as they need to be. Lots of designs, most are cute... some of them I don&#x27;t imagine many people will be inclined to put on their nails, but there&#x27;s certainly a nice variety.     As far as image quality goes, I was completely unable to get anything to look halfway decent with regular (but thick, opaque) nail polish. This came as a surprise to me, as I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m relatively skilled with these sorts of little nail things. However, after breaking down and ordering some Konad stamping polishes I&#x27;m much happier. I still have some trouble with the really fine detailed images. You may look at one and think it&#x27;s going to transfer effortlessly but then you learn that&#x27;s not the case at all, same goes for the ones that look like they wouldn&#x27;t work. I have one Konad brand plate with leopard and zebra stripes, and I&#x27;d say that it is more reliable and does work a little bit better. Is it work the 500% price inflation? Probably not. I&#x27;d only recommend springing for the $5-6 plates if you are not particularly skilled or patient or if they have a certain design you want. My boyfriend was oohing and aahing at my nails (he indulges me, but he was really blown away!) and he says he&#x27;s excited to see what else can be done.     If you want to get your best value, you&#x27;re going to have to be patient and creative- some of the designs may never work perfectly and reliably every time and you may wonder how you could integrate something like fish bones (yes, there is a fish bone stamp) or chili peppers. You&#x27;re just going to have to figure out how you can make different designs work together to get something really amazing.     If you have some time, patience, and about $20 I&#x27;d tell you to try this out. I&#x27;d also suggest going for the special polish; it&#x27;s probably even more important when using generic plates. Order it from Amazon, though... it&#x27;ll be much cheaper. I wish I&#x27;d gotten more colors.</li>
    <li> Again, satisfied with Bundle Monster. Images very clear and nicely etched. Wish the full nail images were larger though ( I did find out later they made them bigger which is GREAT!) Bundle Monster is awesome! ;)</li>
    <li> Very good deal! Got a lot of plates for a very cheap price! I love the plates! The only problem I have is that a few of the images on the plates weren&#x27;t engraved enough so some of them didn&#x27;t stamp very well. But the majority of the images stamp great!</li>
    <li> So many designs! I bought it with the konad&#x27;s stamping device and it was very easy to use. My nails get attention all the time. I love it and highly recommend it! :-)</li>
    <li> This set is super cheap compared to konad so of course you&#x27;re going to get some duds. The full finger plates don&#x27;t fully cover my nail so I was sad about that.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVED this set. The designs were plenty and they were absolutely cool.   It was all just as easy and effective as the Konad stamps.  My only problem is that the full nail designs were waaaay too small for my nails make the design look awkward and weird.  Other then that I love it.</li>
    <li> I love using these stamps, makes nail art fast and fun, when it decides to work with you.  The flaws I found with my plates were:  1. The size of the full nail patterns are a bit small for adults, unless you have very petite hands. When you have to restamp to make the design cover your full nail, it can get messy and time consuming.  2. Some of the smaller designs (i.e. the lips and the star) I am having a hard time getting the nail polish to pick up the design in the corners, making it look not quite right.. if you aren&#x27;t as picky as I am it might not bother you.  I&#x27;m also not using the \\&quot;Konad\\&quot; brand nail polish for my stamping, which I am going to try to see if it improves.   I only took off one star from the review for the size of the stamps, it definitely is annoying when I have to restamp and it winds up being completely off so then I have to redo the nail entirely. Other than those minor flaws the set is great, lots of different designs to play around with.</li>
    <li> i purchased the 2nd set a couple months back and was satisfied with the purchase. the 1st set works well also. some of the images are small and do not cover the full nail but for the price it&#x27;s still a good buy.</li>
    <li> First I bought the BM 25pc set and I have to say it works much better than this one.   The order arrived very quickly and I loved having the plastic on the back.    I knew the full nail designs are smaller than the other set, but they are even smaller than I thought.   Worst of all is that most of designs DOESN&#x27;T WORK. Impesión lines are not deep enough and the scraper takes all nail polish out.  I DON&#x27;T RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AT ALL.</li>
    <li> Product was received in Great condition and was received within a few days. I would definitely order from this vendor again!</li>
    <li> The designs are definitely interesting and neat and if you&#x27;re totally into this stuff and completely obsessed, you will LOVE IT. But if you are an impulse buyer and just want it &#x27;just because&#x27; and think you will use them, it is a pain to work with.  The stamps, the polish, the stamper.  You have to be quick and really either KNOW what you&#x27;re doing or have good practice at it.  So, if you&#x27;re lazy like me, you wont end up using these ever (i&#x27;ve only used these ONCE or TWICE in the past whole year).  But if you are an arty crafty person, or really into nails and designs, then go for it!!</li>
    <li> My gf loves all of the designs and has yet to use them all. There are so many i doubt she will be able to use them all.</li>
    <li> i was hoping this would be worth it. totally wasn&#x27;t.  the engravings aren&#x27;t deep enough, one of the plates was shattered in the design process... but was still in the package.  not happy.</li>
    <li> Pros: Good designs, lots of cute little things. Holidays, cats, hearts (even a pot leaf! I won&#x27;t be using it but it made me laugh) spiderwebs, flowers and some abstract designs. The engravings are deep and the patterns transfer well. Lots of variety. Good quality metal plates with backings that don&#x27;t cut your fingers. Great value for the money!  Cons: I have slim fingers, and the full nail designs aren&#x27;t big enough. It looks silly when I try to do two stamps on my thumb to make up for it, so sadly the full nail designs in this set are unusable for the most part.  I also have the other Bundle Monster set (I think they made it after this set) and the full nail designs are much bigger. Honestly, I&#x27;d recommend having both sets - this set has all the awesome small designs, and the other set has the full-nails.</li>
    <li> Lots of great images and cool designs to choose from.... Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to transfer the image but it&#x27;s pretty cool!</li>
    <li> These stamps are good. I get a lot of use out of them. Some designs are easier to stamp than others and it also depends on the nail polish. Overall, a good buy. I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
    <li> i love these plates.. and i will be buying all sets in the future.. BM plates work perfectly.. worth the investment..</li>
    <li> I was not sure about buying other than konad stamping products but these are great. They work as good as Konad Loved all the plates. I have only used a couple of the plates but will enjoy using more of them. Looking forward to it.</li>
    <li> Majority are not etched properly for image transfer</li>
    <li> Unfortuantely I spent money on something that had absolutely no use. My polish would not transfer the stamp onto the stamper. I tried many of the different designs hoping that I would get at least one but I never did. I would not recomment purchasing stamps from this company.</li>
    <li> I have seen these at fairs for more money.  This was a gift for family that enjoys doing nails at home.</li>
    <li> Can not beat the price and most of the plates are functional. A great set to play with and diverse.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I got these plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this plates. I got the revised versions of this set which basically means some of the full nail designs are bigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my 2nd purchase from bundle monster and so far I  am loving them. So many cute desing, but sadly on 10 fingers to use them on.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, but most of the designs that are meant to cover the whole nail, don&#x27;t fit on the entire nail. Also, you have to play around to see what polish works as they don&#x27;t all work with this. Some are too thick, some too thin. Cute idea though.</li>
    <li> Images are too shallow to transfer properly and full nail images are too small to easily cover all of my nails. (My nails aren&#x27;t exactly long, either, and I had trouble with all except for my pinkie nails.) Going to stick with the Konad plates from here on out. :-/</li>
    <li> I will say extremly fast shipping! But two of my plates were messed up, one had one image cut off and the other one not a single image can be used! I wasn&#x27;t very happy :(  can&#x27;t complain to much price was amazing I just wish I could use the plate because it was my favorite one...</li>
    <li> I bought the Bundle Monster set after reading the reviews. The set has alot of cool designs, but I have one Konad plate and they don&#x27;t really compare. The konad plates are bigger and have a deeper impression. To be fair I did not use the Konad polish with the Bundle Monster set, that may make a difference. I do have to say that my Konad plate did well even though I did not use the konad polishes. I used nail striper polish and my Konad plate did really well and the bundle monster plates were faint in the impression with the same polish. All in all I would say that the plates are fun and I would need to experiment with other polishes to see if they will work right. I forgot to add that I took a white nail block buffer and ran it around each and every plate edge to smooth out the plates because they are very sharp.</li>
    <li> This was so big bundle of plates, that it was so cool to get it so cheap! These are good quality and had protection film on each. There were so many designs that I can be with different style every day :) Thanks!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I am a nail art fanatic and this just added to my fascination with nail art. It takes a couple tries to get this perfect but after that it is complete smooth sailing. I love love LOVE it. And to me these are a much better value then Konads. Buy this product!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sexy. It&#x27;s steamy. It&#x27;s hooooooot. Though some might find it offsensive, I loved it! It can be too much for some but, I thought it was the perfect movie for a good night to turn into a great one!</li>
    <li> I love how many designs come with this package. Some of them don&#x27;t really pick up well at all on the stamper, but most of them work great. You&#x27;ll get the hang of it after time. Make sure to clean it with acetone after using a design. When you are using the same design a few times, there&#x27;s no need to clean it until you&#x27;re done. I will order more from Bundle Monster!</li>
    <li> while I have really enjoyed these plates, the full nail images are far too small for my nails.  Not only are they too short, they are too narrow as well.  I was able to use the full nail images only by turning them so that the length became the width allowing me to use them as French tips.  The images designed for use in this manner are useless to those of us with longer nails.</li>
    <li> They were really good, there are alot of cute n cool designs the only problem is the full nail designs are a little small but otherwise that the quality is really good</li>
    <li> I love doing nail art so when i seen this i was in love.... Ordered the 21 piece set got it very quickly and it absolutely sucked ;( did not work at all i watched so many tutorials on how to do it even have the konad polish it does not work wouldnt even pick it up on the stamper im so unhappy n i hear alot of people saying they dont work waste of $</li>
    <li> Good addition to any Nail Art Collection.  Good clear images that test stamped clear &amp; precise.  Recommended for nail stamping.</li>
    <li> I just got these and played with them for hours! This is my first set of stamping plates and I used a konad double ended stamper and it worked like a charm! Not sure how some people have a hard time with it, even the little images worked great! Just used normal polishes and tested with lots of colors! Overall I think this is worth the $$ :)</li>
    <li> Love this product. Easy to use even for my young girls</li>
    <li> Love it!!! And this requires a set amount of words to submit, i don&#x27;t know what else to say !!</li>
    <li> Well first off, some of the pictures were not etched correctly. Some seem into eachother or others have like tick marks that ruin the picture. Also some dont go on the stamper at all, I dont know if its the polish,plate, or stamper but just be careful. I have a MASH stamper, and just ordered a Konad because it seems like it works better. And the full nail stamps will not cover most fingers, I have small hands and it barely covers, so if you have larger hands and longer nails the full cover stamps will not workout for you.Over all i need more time with the product, maybe some better polishes. But from first try, it is an okay product.</li>
    <li> I was purchasing Konad Plates but they were getting too expensive for me.  When I discovered Bundle Monster Plates and compared the price with Konad, I decided to try it out.  I was very well pleased with the product and the fast delivery.  Konad product, in my opinion, is a more superior quality compared with Bundle Monster, but Bundle Monster will do just as well and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Ok, I read the directions, I read the blogs, I watched the YouTube videos and I still ended up using more polish remover than admiring my skills.between my 16 year old and I we managed to get on a couple stamps that semi resembled what they were supposed to! I highly recommend spending your money on a manicure instead. Although there is a great variety of images to choose from and they are really cool, I just don&#x27;t have the months it would probably take to master this. The product itself I think is of high quality and any professional or highly skilled person would be impressed by the variety of images and quality of these plates.</li>
    <li> This is the first addition set. The full nail images are smaller than konad or later bundle monster sets. They do have the paper backing though.</li>
    <li> Okay so here&#x27;s my problem I have long nail beds. So even though I keep my nails short - no nails over my finger tips- the full nail stamps are just too short. I hate it. What the point of buying fun full nail stamps when they don&#x27;t even work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; BUT I have no transfer problems. The indents are deep enough so the design always transfers which is good. I have no problems with their smaller,, single designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this stamp kit works get but the designs are just too small for my nails.</li>
    <li> This product was horrible the plates are too shallow and will not transfer! Very disappointing. I bought the mash plates which were cheaper and they worked great. I was going to purchase the other bundle monster plates I&#x27;m glad I waited till I tried these out. I wish I could return them :(&lt;br /&gt;I should have listened to all the bad reviews.</li>
    <li> Awesome plates with a variety of images, from full nail designs to fancy French tips to small individual images. The full images are sized pretty well to cover your entire nail, but as with all regularly sized plates, you may need to do two stamps on long or wide nails. I have medium-long length nails (1/8\\&quot; past the tips of my fingers with long nail beds, totaling about 5/8\\&quot;) and found the length of the stamp to be perfect on all of my nails, and with careful application the width was perfect for all but my thumbs and even that was close enough that I did not feel the need to stamp again at the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would definitely recommend to any nail art enthusiasts. It takes practice, but once you get the hang of stamping, you will have nails that people will often comment on and be amazed when you tell them you did it yourself.</li>
    <li> never worked like tv advertisement</li>
    <li> These do not print nicely on your fingernail. It is very hard for the novice user. Beware.</li>
    <li> I was worried because the other reviews but they work so much better than the ones I bought in store. I do not have any problems, all the tiny details came out, they also shipped really fast. i love all the designs on them and I use them all the time. I change my nails a lot so they last with all the times I clean them and use them.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get why there are so many positive reviews about this product. The plates were engraved in such a way that it is IMPOSSIBLE to do anything. Such a waste on money.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY IT!</li>
    <li> This was ordered as a gift for my grand daughter and she has used them a lot.  They seem to work as expected.</li>
    <li> This is a good starter set, there are lots of designs, for a low price, and most of them work well.  As others have stated, the Konad plates have better detail and sharper images.  I am disappointed that the all-over designs are not large enough.  The entire plate is about 5.5cm across, and there are 6 designs on some, so each one is only 1cm across.  My pinky is 1cm, but my other nails are about 1.5 cm and my thumb is almost 2cm.  I don&#x27;t think I have freakishly large hands...  Just so you know if you measure your own nails, these may not work.  The smaller designs are usually fine.  I thinks some of the other BM sets have larger all-over designs, but all the plates are a standard size.</li>
    <li> Delivery of this product was fast, packaging was a little bit of a pain but I had my sister help me. She was also my guinea pig to trying stamping. We had so much fun with it that I got her the 25pc set for Christmas. This set has a lot more individual cutsey images while the other set has more full nail images. It&#x27;s fun but it takes a while to get the hang of. There are so many resources online for stamping so if you need alternative polishes to use or techniques, they&#x27;re out there and easy to find a list of. I recommend this cheap set to start. And don&#x27;t forget a rubber stamp (I bought the double sided one with a fat side for full nail and small side for individual small stamps).</li>
    <li> These are not engraved deep enough to hold the polish and does NOT stamp a design at all...the tips and full nail designs are way to small to fit on any adult nails...  Very disappointed...DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.  I own several real Konad plates and do not have any problems with them.  Buyer Beware.......</li>
    <li> These plates have a paper backing and a protective plastic seal, they arrived quickly and stamp with clear results. The real problem with these plates is that the full nail images are tiny, as are the french tips - they barely covered my pinky.... The small designs are all usable, and the full nail images can be turned on their side to use as french tips, but the size is still disappointing.</li>
    <li> I ordered these plates after stumbling across the concept of stamping online. I did some research and found many people stating although it&#x27;s a great concept, the Konad plates are simply to overpriced. When I found the plates, and the polish, I must say I agreed. I did my research and found this bundle monster set. I am OVERJOYED with the results. There are tons of great designs. I&#x27;ve tried the full designs, tips, and small images, and every image I&#x27;ve tried so far has worked great. A few things to keep in mind, they have revised this product so they are no longer sharp. They have a protective backing so no more worries about cutting your fingers. A review on here was super helpful in teaching me how to do stamping. I did it sucesfully my first try. I&#x27;d like to help others so below is my exact experience with the plates, what else I used, and how I did it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. When you recieve the plates, there is a blue plastic cover over each. Peel the covers off as you use the plates. I didn&#x27;t bother removing all of them at once, I saw no reason to do so as you can see the images through the cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I grabbed a paper plate to keep everything on. I pull out all supplies before getting started. I grabbed my polish remover pump with 100% pure acetone in it, then I grabbed the Konad stamper and scraper, q-tips, Sally Hansen Base and top coat, and 2 regular polish colors. You can choose to buy the konad stamping polish, but I did not and have been totally satisfied using OPI, Sally Hansen, and generic polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. A few tips for you. 100% pure acetone is great because it&#x27;s the fastest for cleaning the plates and stamper between transfers. The pump is really useful because you can press the q-tips to the pump and get them full of remover without having to risk touching your newly painted nails to the remover. I looked at the generic stamper and found it didnt&#x27; have nearly the good reviews the konad did for only $2 more. I also read reviews that said to use a old gift card instead of the konad scraper. The gift card idea actually did not work at all for me, and the konad scraper has worked great without damaging any plates. As for polish, I&#x27;d suggest using white and black your first times stamping since they&#x27;re easiest to see on the stamper. I used OPI white and Sally Hansen black. I have stamped with all OPI and sally hansen $2 polish and had no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Time to get started. Paint a base coat of clear polish to keep your nails from yellowing. A thin coat is best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Paint whatever color of polish you picked out to cover your whole nail (you can use these to stamp only tips, but I&#x27;d suggest doing full designs your first try) Try to pick a polish you only need one coat for, but 2 is okay. Less coats equals less change of smudging or those nasty clumps of polish that you get if your touch your still wet nail to something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Here&#x27;s where the stamping comes in. You wanna be quick about it, but don&#x27;t be so quick that you&#x27;re sloppy. choose a polish (don&#x27;t pick an instant dry polish for this, it wont work) paint a good layer of polish onto the plate. Grab your scraper and scrape it across the image to remove extra polish. Someone on here suggested taping the plate down or buying a plate holder. I&#x27;ve found I don&#x27;t need to tape them, they don&#x27;t slide on the paper plate. It also gives you one less thing to clean off. If you purchase the plate holder you&#x27;d have to get the polish off that as well. After scraping the extra polish pick up you&#x27;re stamper. Use the large end for large designs and the small end for small designs. Firmly press the stamper to the plate, almost rolling it across the image to insure no smudges. The lift the stamper and look at the image on it to make sure it transfered clear. Then line the stamper up to your nail, I prefer to roll from left to right, but it&#x27;s up to your preference. You don&#x27;t need to press all that hard. Just roll the stamper across your nail to get the full image. After stamping you should have 1 nail completed, a side from the top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Take a q-tip and press it to the polish remover pump. Use the acetone remover to fully clean off your plate, scraper, and stamper. Then begin step 6 all over again and repeat until every nail is painted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. After the image drys (this takes a very short ammount of time) paint a top coat to really give your nails that shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. After your top coat drys, clean up is simple if you used a paper plate. Put all of your used q-tips on the plate. All the extra polish ended up on the plate as well so no need to clean it up. Make sure your tools are all totally cleaned off. I keep my plates in a zip lock, nothing fancy. Then pick up your plate, and toss it in the trash. You&#x27;re done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this will be helpful to you. These plates are a really great value and I don&#x27;t ever plan to buy a $5 konad plate when I got 21 plates for 17.99 and free shipping. They work wonderfuly and have tons of cute designs. I plan to purchase the 2nd set of these in the future just to get even more designs. I also read some people said that the image doesn&#x27;t cover the whole finger? I&#x27;m really confused about that part. I have really long fingers, long nail beds, and long nails in general. I&#x27;ve had no problem getting the image to cover my whole nail. As long as you transfer the whole image it&#x27;s plenty big enough. If you have wide nails simply put the image on your nail starting on one side, then stamp a half image and line it up on the right to overlap the design. I did this with my big toe since that was the only time I needed to, and it worked great. Another thing to keep in mind is you&#x27;re best off having really contrasting colors. I did blue with white stamps, red with black stamps, and white with pink stamps and was really happy. I just did turqoise with silver stamps and although it&#x27;s cool they blend together a little to much.</li>
    <li> Compared with other seller, this one reach within 4 days. It is super fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among 21 pieces, there are only 5 with full nail picture. It is a little bit disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Most of them are ok, but Some of these are not big enough for my thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is not as good as Konad. So just got what I pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several design. It is ok to use the simple design but when I try some more complex design, I can not pick up it from plate. I am not sure it is because of my skill or the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get these plates. I got them and immediately sat down to play with them and was so disappointed. The full nail designs were so small they didn&#x27;t cover my nails and I have small nails. The little designs didn&#x27;t work at all! I was so disappointed. I&#x27;m sending them back immediately. I really wanted them to work and they just didn&#x27;t. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> the images aren&#x27;t even close to big enough. they dont even cover the width of my fingers or the length and you cant connect two of the same stamp because its extremely visible and ugly :((( hope the third set thats coming out fits or at least have a side that connects or something :)</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the stamping plates once I got the hang of it, but when I received the item I was slightly disappointed. I was missing plates 03 and 04, and I had double plate 05.</li>
    <li> they work great! So many different patterens!! My family and I love it!! I would recomend to all nail designers! If you love to do nail you love these!</li>
    <li> I received the product at the time the reseller stated. They work great. I have been able to get all the images stampped on my nails. The only defect is that the complete nail image is not large enough.</li>
    <li> I got these when I went to Canada and my host&#x27;s sister would do my nails with one of these every night. It&#x27;s cool! It takes some practice to get used to applying it so that it&#x27;s actually visible, but it isn&#x27;t hard.</li>
    <li> Got this for my birthday, and started playing with it right away. It took a while to get the film off, but it was worth it. I used just regular polish to stamp and practiced techniques and scrapping and such. You need to be quick with scrapping and putting on a nail or paper, but I loved the results! The variety is great and it is good for a lot of holidays (Halloween, Xmas, ect.) There&#x27;s a good selection of florals and others cool things. The only problem is that some of the designs are harder to get off. But with some practice, I hope to get all of them to work!</li>
    <li> I wish some of the designs were a little bigger so they cover more of the nail especially the ones with more details, with some colors the details don&#x27;t stand out as much. Overall I think they are great for adding a little flare to your nails.</li>
    <li> They stamp work very well!!!</li>
    <li> Adorei o produto. Chegou mais rápido do que o que eu esperava e chegou conforme anúncio. Recomendo o vendedor a todos.</li>
    <li> These plates were reasonably priced, and you get a lot of different images, but in comparison to Konad plates, they are lacking. The image doesn&#x27;t transfer well onto the stamper as the plates seem to be too thin to hold enough polish, so it dries before you can transfer it. I don&#x27;t have that problem with my Konad plates.</li>
    <li> First, I bought these knowing the \\&quot;full\\&quot; nail designs were tiny, and boy, are they tiny! 1/4\\&quot; by 9/16\\&quot; or just under 1 cm by 1.4 cm, so I bought this for some of the cute and pretty individual designs.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried them all, but some of the designs seem to not be etched very deeply, and are really very tricky to use. So, unless I got a bum set, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as a starter set. The peacock on BM15 is a good example - I tried it with several polishes and both my Konad and Salon Express stampers (each pick up and release designs differently) and I only got a decent image once out of about 15 attempts, even with polishes I&#x27;ve used successfully with other intricate designs.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this has some very interesting designs, from cute to sophisticated, although a few designs seem pointless because it&#x27;s hard to tell what they are. I think a couple of them are supposed to be flames?? Otherwise, the styles range from cute or funny to elegant, and some would look good as a single stamp on a nail or repeated in a pattern all over. Some of the \\&quot;full\\&quot; designs could be used partially for a nice design (only fill part of the design with polish and/or wipe the rest of the unwanted part of the design off the stamp with a q-tip or stick) so these are pretty versatile. While not all are etched very deeply, the design edges are crisp and clean and have nice detail.&lt;br /&gt;There are better sets out there, but if you have some experience with stamping and patience, then you&#x27;ll probably want to add this to your collection for some of the unusual designs. If you&#x27;re just getting started, I recommend the Cheeky Summer 2012 plates, which have bigger full nail designs and are etched deeply.</li>
    <li> Have tried quite a few of the designs from just about every plate and have had very good luck with most of them.  Have found a couple of the designs that did not seem to be etched quite as deep as others that were a bit trickier to use.  Only have 2 or 3 designs that I could not get to work at all. Have discovered that if I use the buffer on the stamper right before trying the more difficult designs that they would work better.The full nail designs are not as large as some of the other brands.  The fit well on my smaller nails, but are not wide enough for my thumbs and are not long enough for my longer nails.</li>
    <li> Love these stamps, will definitley buy from BM again! I am now an official BM buyer!&lt;br /&gt;So many great designs to choose from!</li>
    <li> Perfect product! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I guess my set is defective, because these were a huge disappointment. I bought them forever ago and I get them out periodically to try again, but they NEVER work. I&#x27;ve tried several different plates, tons of different polishes, different stamping methods, stampers, etc, and the image just never, ever transfers to the stamper. I could never have used the full nail designs to begin with, as they&#x27;re too small, but I would love to be able to use the other ones. sigh.</li>
    <li> I love these plates. All of the images that I have tried pick up and transfer very well. I randomly picked 2 images from each plate to test. They all worked great! As many others have said the full nail images are a bit on the small side. The other issue many were bothered by has been fixed. Bundle Monster has now started putting backing on the plates. This set is a great bargin!</li>
    <li> This is such a great deal on these stamps. Once you get the hang of it after a couple of rounds, these stamps are super easy and look great with all kinds of color combos. I definitely recommend these to any DIYer out there obsessed with polish!</li>
    <li> These plates work really well, the only problem I have is that the full-nail stamps are too small to fully cover my thumb and middle-finger nail, and barely cover my ring and index, I have to be very careful to center them exactly. I don&#x27;t have very large nails compared to most, so I suspect this would be a problem many would share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I really do like these. The designs are super fun and the ones that aren&#x27;t meant to fully cover a nail are easy to use.</li>
    <li> I was very excited yesterday to try out my stamping plates.  I picked out a couple of designs to attempt, and to my disappointment I&#x27;m finding that quite a few of these designs are not etched deep enough.  When you scrape off the excess polish, no polish remains to transfer to the stamper.  The ones that did work worked well, but I&#x27;d hoped for a better product.</li>
    <li> I was wanting a nail art kit and this was at a good price.  When it came it was just what I wanted!</li>
    <li> Totally affordable, And the stamps work fine. Got some great images :]Also really easy to use. But i wish the full nail designs were bigger! I have small hands so they are fine for me, But they certainly wont work on my clients :[</li>
    <li> This product came fast for me considering I live in England and it wasn&#x27;t damaged. Very pleased with the product but I do see what people say about the images being small but I can make them work. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> i read a bunch of reviews about this product, and i have to say, i dont want to buy this cuz i think it didnt work! but THEY WORK PERFECTLY! are amazing! so much figures! i love it!</li>
    <li> Well worth the money! The designs are all cute the plates transfer nicely however I have only had good luck using the konad polish. I can&#x27;t seem to find a cheaper polish that works well, most dry to fast. I am happy with my image plates.</li>
    <li> This product is very low quality. These images did not  transfer and it was not user error as I compared them side by side to a Konad plate.  Stick with MoYou-London, Konad or Cheeky.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my bundle monster stamping plates.  Not only are they cheaper than Konad, I also think they work better!  The only downside to these plates vs. konad is that the actual stamps are smaller.  Because I have short nails, this isn&#x27;t an issue for me, but I can see how it would get on other people&#x27;s nerves.  That being said, even when I have messed up and missed part of my nail, almost all of the patterns are such that it would not be glaringly obvious that you had to stamp twice.  Being so inexpensive, I was really concerned that the metal would be flimsy but it actually was nice and thick; these plates are great quality.  As you can see in the picture, there are also TONS of fun and unique designs, no boring repeats.  I would highly recommend this kit to anyone interested in nail stamping!</li>
    <li> These plates are much nicer than the originals I have. They have a lining on the back to keep the edges from being sharp. Good designs, just wish I could find plates for looong nails. I would definitely recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> Plates are great! My daughter and I have so much fun with them! I have ordered all the Bundle Moster plates, so far and I love them all! great designs and once you get the hang of it they are easy to use! I use a business card to scrape the nail polish off. the scraper wasn&#x27;t working so great for me.</li>
    <li> I am a nail tec, and these are 100% useless. The company that made these didn&#x27;t engrave the plates deep enough, not a single plate works. It has nothing to do with polish whatsoever. Stick with Konad or Cheeky brand plates.... every plate works and works well with these two brands.</li>
    <li> The price is unbeatable compared to the konad. I really love this. It is very nice and affordable since konad is expensive especially because it&#x27;s hype. The one thing that I do not like is that the edge is a bit rough around the edge. There is also plastic so make sure to peel that off before using. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> ok so i may be a little obsessed with the whole stamping thing but i luv it cause its so easy to do once you find the right nail polish and technique. as far as this product goes its the cheapest of the monster bundle set and it has some pretty decent designs so if you just wanna test out brands like i did i would try this one out first. i did have some issues with some of the plates when they arrived some of the plates had scratches on them slight scuffs made it past the blue film that protects. I tried them out and the worked fine so i kept them. I don&#x27;t mind the scratches since its gonna eventually happen but id like to be the one to make them... but with the scratches so slight its wasn&#x27;t worth my time to send them back</li>
    <li> I purchased these nail plates and I was really excited to use them. They don&#x27;t really work. I&#x27;ve tried with multiple different nail polishes and what I find is that the plates are too shallow. When you scrape across the image, too much nail polish comes off. Then when you use the stamper, you only get part of the design. I was really disappointed. My friend and I split the plates and she had the same issue.</li>
    <li> Ordered &amp; received this product in a timely fashion!  Super easy to use and so much fun to try all of the different stamps!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase this set because I have read reviews that they do not work well. I tested every image and they all worked perfectly. They are a bit tricky but once you get the hang of it you will be fine.</li>
    <li> These are great if you like doing fun designs on your nails. Came with a lot to choose from, but they take some skill and getting used to, to do these successfully. Good luck, but you&#x27;ll enjoy them too. Great deal.</li>
    <li> these just dont work like you would think they should...</li>
    <li> I bought this product as my first stamping set, and I loved it. Unfortunately with all stamping, you usually have to find a very opaque or dark color to stamp with. I liked most of the designs, although the full nail designs did not cover my entire nail (and my nails aren&#x27;t that wide or big). There were a lot of designs that I have still never used but I would definitely recommend it to beginners, since with these plates at such a good price you can learn about how to stamp better.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews. I have used actual Konad brand plates and these work just as well. At first I was frustrated becuase I couldn&#x27;t get the pattern on to the stamper, but honestly all it took was practice! Maybe I was working too slow or wasn&#x27;t pushing hard enough...I&#x27;m really not sure. But I don&#x27;t do my nails without a pattern now...too boring! :) Anyways, I posted 5 pictures under the name &#x27;Danielle&#x27; if you want to see some examples. Some of the \\&quot;whole nail\\&quot; designs don&#x27;t cover the whole nail, but you just have to make it work! Again, practice. Even if the two don&#x27;t line up perfectly, who is going to notice? No one. They are going to say \\&quot;your nails are awesome!\\&quot;. I recommend buying these. Even though I don&#x27;t use EVERY pattern (such as the pot leaf,  haha) it is still WAY better than paying $6.50 per plate through Konad.</li>
    <li> Item as described, love these plates!</li>
    <li> très belle plaques, un régal pour les fans de nail art&lt;br /&gt;reçues le 12 décembre 2012 alors que la livraison était prévue à partir du 20 décembre. Que du positif</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried them all, so as other reviewers said, some may be too shallow to use. I bought these to go along with the stamping kit I had newly gotten, because I wanted some variety. These worked great, I especially like the feather, floral designs, and animal prints. These do scratch up easily, but that doesn&#x27;t effect the design. Very happy with them.</li>
    <li> really good deal on the nail stamp set &amp; came in pretty quick the girlfriend was happy &amp; wont stop using them</li>
    <li> The designs are good the plates are etched well and stamp well they do come with paper backing and plastic peel off cover to keep them from getting damaged in transit.</li>
    <li> My wife used them and really enjoyed them they were very nice, and would recommend them to anyone that does nails.</li>
    <li> These stamping plates are very poor quality. They are too shallow, so they do not work. I bought these for my nail tech and when they are compared to other stamp plates there is an extremely noticeable difference in the thickness and quality.</li>
    <li> Estoy muy contenta con mi pedido, lo he recibido en 15 dias.&lt;br /&gt;Las placas estan nuy bien, nada que envidiar a las Konad.&lt;br /&gt;El único problema es qie el diseño para la uña entera son muy pequeños y no la cubre el resto genial</li>
    <li> so much fun to use , easy also&lt;br /&gt;we have many good girl nights with all the nail art stuff</li>
    <li> This was my first purchase of nail art stamp templates and I was impressed with the selection and the price.  I have tested a few and love the designs.</li>
    <li> these are just so much fun. some of them are hard to get up all the little details with the stamper, but all in all they are alot of fun. the full finger prints however are a bit small to use on all of my nails, so i have yet to completely figure out how to remedy that. other than that, super cute</li>
    <li> These had some cute stamps on them! I thought they were a little pricy though. I also had some trouble getting the nailpolish to &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; the design off of the stamp, but that could have just been the nailpolish I used.</li>
    <li> Out of ALL the discs I got, I only found maybe 5 designs I liked. They really need to have up close BIG images of what is offered with these plates because you pay all this money and end up not using 90% of them or tossing it. I found this to be a waste for me but it&#x27;s my personal preferences that lead to me not liking many designs on these discs.</li>
    <li> Great if you have time for it!</li>
    <li> Lovd all the designs that are offered on these nail plates. I received on time and enjoy doing different nail designs.</li>
    <li> I found the plate images are too small for my adult sized nails. My nails are average in size naturally and I apply acrylics for medium length.  I have been using image plates consistently for two months and have the best results using Konad and Mash.  My only suggestion for this brand is to look for plates that contain four instead of six full nail images since the more on the plate the smaller the size.  As for the other images in this series some work and some do not.  The engravings on some were not deep enough to hold the polish for application.  The only reason that I did not return this item is because I did not want to pay for non-refundable return shipping fees and the company did not feel they were at fault.  Overall there is better quality brands available for the same cost.</li>
    <li> wonderful item but didn&#x27;t realize it had a pot leaf design on it :( other than that, I just love it....just cant show THAT particular plate to kids!</li>
    <li> This item came very quickly. I have had no problems with it. Nothing was damaged and it still works. I am happy with this product!</li>
    <li> these are fun and they work pretty well. not as good as some other plates i have but i still like them. for the price don&#x27;t regret this purchase at all.</li>
    <li> Love me some bundle monsters. I have all their series and their binders too. This is a great starter set for a newbie to stamping.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about getting this set however it did not work as well as I thought it would. I did read the reviews and still took a chance. None of the designs I tried to use worked for me as they would not transfer to the stamper. If it really worked I would give it more stars but it does not work for me &#x3D; (</li>
    <li> I am very satisfy with the quality and all. The stamping plates work great on both the special and regular polish. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The designs are very pretty but the only drawback is that the full nail images are way too small. They won&#x27;t cover your nails, maybe only the pinky finger. You will definitely need to get creative and figure out how to work with those images. A big plus for me was that when I let them know that 1 plate was defective they responded right away to let me know they will replace it at no cost to me.</li>
    <li> It has many beautiful stamps for your nails, exactly as indicated in Amazon. At the beginning it was a bit difficult to use it properly, but after few attempts, you get practice. Also, my nails are too wide for this motives, but I still like it.</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;m glad I went with this brand because of the variety of designs for the price, the quality of the plates isn&#x27;t the best. The tips are too small even for my nails and I have pretty small nails. Sometimes the designs don&#x27;t transfer well because they are shallower in some places than others. Still, this is a good introductory set, if you aren&#x27;t sure if you&#x27;ll like stamping or not.</li>
    <li> I bought these last year after I had purchased the cheap tv stamper set that was being sold at Sally&#x27;s. Don&#x27;t buy that set if you can help it. Get a Konad stamper and pick someone else&#x27;s plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Bundle plates, just like any other project/skill/product that you use have their drawbacks.&lt;br /&gt;These plates do work well, and the newer sets come with a paper backing to protect the edges. Some people state that the images don&#x27;t come through, but it really depends on a couple of things, so if your images don&#x27;t come through on these plates, here are some things to keep in mind:&lt;br /&gt;1. try a different stamper. I bought a Konad recently and it stamped beautifully, especially the delicate full-nail leaf pattern. Came out very well.&lt;br /&gt;2. it could be your polish. Some of the wet and wild stuff works, china glaze does too, as does sally hansen. but it depends on the consistency and chemicals used in the polish, so don&#x27;t be discouraged! I would recommend using the same brand of top coat that you are using to do the stamping design, because some I have used seem to \\&quot;melt\\&quot; the base coats away after a light brush.&lt;br /&gt;3. it could be your technique. press firmly but evenly as you go down. Don&#x27;t press hard enough to break your finger, but a little pressure may help in transfering. Also, work quickly, as the paint on the plate or stamped will dry.&lt;br /&gt;4. it could be that you didn&#x27;t clean the plate properly. I thoroughly clean out every desgin with acetone nail polish remover, and make sure all the cracks are clean. DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE USE NAIL POLISH REMOVER WITH MOISTURIZERS. THE OILS AND CHEMICALS MAY CAUSE THE NAIL POLISH NOT TO ADHERE TO THE STAMPER AND WON&#x27;T WORK!&lt;br /&gt;5. the plate could be bad. I haven&#x27;t tried every design, so I can&#x27;t say which are bad, but they seemed to do okay. If you work fast and you roll the stamper in an even motion across your nails in one direction, and NOT back and forth, your design should be ok.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good stamped makes a helluva lot of difference when doing this. Otherwise, they are good plates, although the rose doesn&#x27;t come out too well in my opinion, and the full nail designs are too small, as many others have said. I&#x27;m not picky. I just match up and restamp the open space on the nail and it turns out good.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, okay quality for the price and interesting designs for those who are just starting out and want to have something a little different to play with. Cheers!</li>
    <li> I like how many i got for the price but about 6 of the plates had scratch marks from either being used previously or from a manufacturing mistake because some of the patterns look like the engraving tool didnt get lifted off of the plate before moving to the next design. But i use the patterns i can from these, and its way cheaper than buying directly from the konad site.</li>
    <li> I was pretty excited for these plates but when I used them, none of the images worked. I have tried many different nail polishes and still the images dont stick to the stamper. I am extremely disappointed with these plates and sad that now I have $18 worth of junk.</li>
    <li> Some of the plates don&#x27;t work as well, seems the designs are a bit too shallow or something? But most work great, lots of fun and can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I thought I would love these...I have a pre-teen at home and it looked like a great idea......I was wrong....super hard to get image to pick up and doesn&#x27;t show up well.....and even had the right polish for the stamps....don&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
    <li> These stamping plates are so cute and have a ton to choose from for one low price! They work great with any nail stamping kit! Practice makes perfect! And move quick as the polish dries quick!</li>
    <li> I am new to the stamping nail world, but I am now obsessed. These were the first plates that I purchased, and these are really nice! The scraper (that comes with the Konad stamper set ~ purchased separately) tends to leave big scratches in them, so I used an old credit card from walmart with much better results. I am surprised at how well the designs come out, very crisp! These plates are very sturdy and for the price, is totally worth it. Much better than using stickers. I will be buying more plates with different designs.</li>
