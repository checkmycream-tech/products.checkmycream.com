      <li>I normally don&#x27;t write reviews on products unless I absolutely love them and if I don&#x27;t like them I normally stray from reviews because what didn&#x27;t work for me may work for someone else.</li>

      <li>They&#x27;re also quite large for eye brushes (Which is why I thought they were concealer brushes).</li>

      <li>The brushes are dense and soft.</li>
      <li>They held up well when I initially washed them immediately after receiving them and went back to the correct shape without much effort.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I got my brush set in about a week ago and I love them.  They are all very soft and so far have held up to application and cleaning without losing bristles.  I would highly recommend this set.  There are honestly too many brushes for me, but it&#x27;s a great deal I couldn&#x27;t pass up.  Plus the chevron print bag is adorable!</li>
    <li> My daughter loved the brushes.</li>
    <li> Super happy with this brush set. The brushes are pretty and soft, and the case is really cute. No complaints!</li>
    <li> Love it! Soft on my face and last longer than my other brushes that I got on TopHatter.</li>
    <li> I looooooove this prushes .. But i thout it have more high materials</li>
    <li> Super soft and good quality brushes. Good price</li>
    <li> These are fine brushes. I&#x27;m not a professional, but I do a lot of stage makeup and I love to experiment with new things. These seemed to be inexpensive yet nice enough for my purposes. I have not yet tried them all. The brushes are dense and soft. I have no problem blending. I did something with face paint last weekend. These brushes were not streaky and they seemed to wash well though I had to rinse some more than once to get the black out of the bristles. I look forward to playing with them some more.  The case is fine. It smells like print shop chemicals, but has started to air out for me. The brush slots are quite large, so I&#x27;ve stuffed my other brushes in along with them to hold them in more snugly.  As I&#x27;ve used them more, I&#x27;m finding the eye brushes in this set aren&#x27;t great. It came with several flat brushes that I thought were concealer brushes, but are apparently for eyes. The bristles on those are too stiff and dense. There&#x27;s a lot of fall out and I can&#x27;t pack color well with those. They&#x27;re also quite large for eye brushes (Which is why I thought they were concealer brushes). I&#x27;ll be looking into an eye brush set eventually to help round out this collection.  The angled contouring brush is probably my favorite brush in the set. It blends really well and is quite precise and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great case. Stirdy brushes. Bristles are nice.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews on products unless I absolutely love them and if I don&#x27;t like them I normally stray from reviews because what didn&#x27;t work for me may work for someone else. That being said, I originally bought this set based off a recommendation from a colleague and was so excited considering the price and amount of product you receive.

So as of last week the little amount of brushes I had left were off on the plane with my 7 year old niece to play with. Like I said, they worked for an old colleague but it&#x27;s not really worth the 50/50 hit or miss.</li>
    <li> Good quality brushes. Prompt delivery. All brushes came intact &amp; in a cute pouch with the face brushes containing an additional brush cover. They had a bit of a smell, but as soon as you wash them, the scent goes away. Been using them for almost a month &amp; no brush hair has came out. Brushes are nice &amp; soft.</li>
    <li> I brought those brushes for my cousin as a birthday present and she really loved it , I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Omg these brushes are amazing, blends well too</li>
    <li> I like the quality, it does smells a little bit, I would recommend :)</li>
    <li> Excellent product, well made &#x27;&#x27;, excellent quality and efficient delivery .</li>
    <li> Very soft brushes, my makeup looks great!</li>
    <li> I am loving all the make up how to&#x27; son YouTube &amp; Facebook. I decided I need to branch out and try some new techniques. I got Karity Cosmetics Bamboo brush set. Here&#x27;s what I like about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*a brush for every part of your face or type of make up you want to apply&lt;br /&gt;*high quality bamboo brushes&lt;br /&gt;*bristles are soft and don&#x27;t fall off easily&lt;br /&gt;*huge variety of brushes&lt;br /&gt;*gorgeous colorful chevron carrying case&lt;br /&gt;*has a zipper pouch for your needs&lt;br /&gt;*fine to thick or wide to thin brushes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This truly is a professional quality make up brush kit. It also is just beautiful. High quality construction is in all the components of this brush set. If you need it to apply make up its in here. It&#x27;s worth every penny. You&#x27;ll buy this once! Stay away from the cheaply drug store sets and invest in this set. You&#x27;ll have it as long as you take care of them. BRAVO Karity. I recommend this set for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this set for a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review. All opinions expressed here are solely my own.</li>
    <li> Discovered I prefer brushes with dark bristles -- so powders &amp; makeup don&#x27;t immediately color them &amp; necessitate washing. Went back to my prior set.</li>
    <li> I love it so far. It is really gentle and doesn&#x27;t shed!</li>
    <li> This is a great set of really usable brushes without a bunch of extra ones you never touch.  I&#x27;m not in the makeup profession and purchased these for home use.  They clean easily and are good quality.  I haven&#x27;t had any shedding.  They held up well when I initially washed them immediately after receiving them and went back to the correct shape without much effort.  They are very soft.  They are easy to load and distribute the cosmetics evenly without a bunch of waste; I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m leaving half of my expensive makeup on the brush.  I would recommend these to anyone in the market for a good set of brushes.  As a great bonus, the colorful chevron case is adorable!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve felt Ulta and Mac brushes and they&#x27;re even softer than those brand names. Although they could be denser, they&#x27;re are excellent quality.  I highly recommend them and will purchase another set for my family member because it is quality for a professional make up artist.</li>
