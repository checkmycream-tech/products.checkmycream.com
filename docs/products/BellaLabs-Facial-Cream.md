      <li>It is better than some but not as good as others.</li>
      <li>Of course I knew this but was looking for a really nice cream.</li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed, after the wonderful fragrance of course, is how it completely absorbed into my skin....</li>

      <li>I used this product in the summer and was really pleased with how light it felt and how nicely it went on under my makeup.</li>

      <li>Hopefully someone else will have had better luck.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want to receive more creams</li>
      <li>It is better than the cream that I used before.</li>
      <li>I apply make up on top and had no issue with that</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, but one of the ingredients is titanium dioxide which I prefer not to put on my skin or eat.  </li>
      <li>skin.&lt;br /&gt;See my review of La Creme Face Cream if you want to know more about the type of chemical reaction.</li>
      <li>Bought it, and I knew better, being an Esthetician, but I thought I would try the sample, that turned into $80 some dollars, because I threw it in my closet and forgot about it.</li>
      <li>Comes in a nice looking bottle and was shipped and delivered very fast.</li>
      <li>nothing special and mostly bottle weight.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels firmer, some of my fine lines have diminished.</li>
      <li>It is cheap, pore-clogging gunk.</li>
      <li>They advertise free trial and customer to pay $4.99 .</li>
      <li>im using this in just weeks ago, but you can see the difference, my face is smooth,</li>
      <li>I use it for a month, and feel the cream smooth my skin.</li>
      <li>I enjoy this project</li>
      <li>The cream is really light</li>
      <li>Great facial cream.  </li>
      <li>The cream has a very distinct smell, almost like sunscreen</li>
      <li>This product  was given to me for free with the understanding of a true review.</li>
      <li>Its incredible how many negative reviews there are from people that haven&#x27;t purchased the product from Amazon even.</li>
      <li>I was charged the full price on day 10 after my original purchase - not 14 days afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>nothing special</li>
      <li>Nothing special whatsoever.</li>
      <li>, it made my face feel nice and soft</li>
      <li>This BellaLabs Facial Cream is good on my face,</li>
      <li>You will not get a full refund if dissatisfied with this skin product.</li>
      <li>I like the smell too its too mild.</li>
      <li>The cream absorbed really quickly into the skin and leaves absolutely no oil or greasy feeling which I loved.</li>
      <li>fine lines and wrinkles much diminished.</li>
      <li>I received this facial cream in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
      <li>It does take longer than 14 days to see results, but it was worth it.</li>
      <li>and I produced a rash around my laugh lines.</li>
      <li>Pure Junk!  </li>
      <li>The box says to use everyday for 2 months, and I&#x27;m sure after 2 months the results will be even better</li>
      <li>Isn&#x27;t it interesting that the only rave reviews are amazon verified customers and the others that say run away are not?  </li>
      <li>They are interested in tricking you so they can &amp;#34;legally&amp;#34; charge your credit card $83 on the 15th day from the date of your order.</li>
      <li>My face felt smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to others and be back to order more for myself...</li>
      <li>, both BellaLabs and LaCreme got $87.63 each from my charge card and, yes, they did automatically charge another $87.63 each one month from the first delivery.  </li>
      <li>It really works!</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says it will do in the length of time it states.  </li>
      <li>Smooth, soft, gentle feeling.</li>
      <li>It absorbs into the skin pretty fast and its not greasy at all.</li>
      <li>Really luxurious cream and the packaging (bottle) is quite pretty.</li>
      <li>I will have to say that this is one of the better creams I have used in a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Works really well with La Creme face cream</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>I filled out a brief survey in June  while on the Amazon website.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The package information states that you won&#x27;t see a real difference until 8 weeks, so, how can you decide after 14 days if it&#x27;s going to work for you?  </li>
      <li>I have this product as a gift, I really like the style</li>
      <li>The product seems to smooth the facial skin and eliminate crows feet at the corner of the eyes.</li>
      <li>Using with LaCreme face cream and am seeing a real improvement in my skin tone and texture.</li>
      <li>I noticed a real difference after using the cream a week or so.</li>
      <li>It really causes wrinkles to reduce or vanish.  </li>
      <li>Real charges do not show on Invoice.</li>
      <li>This company gets its money with their 14 DAY FREE TRIAL offer by starting the TRIAL the day you ORDER it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see a real difference with these products.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Received the package today...used it instantly! Smooth, soft, gentle feeling. No tingle or harshness that some other facial cleaners leave when you apply it. I have sensitive skin due to my authentic...Wonderful stuff...I would recommend this to others and be back to order more for myself...thanks</li>
    <li> My skin has a glow.  I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Not what I thought I ordered.  This was suppose to be ANTI-WRINKLE and it was not.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I thought it was, and didn&#x27;t do what it promised.  I&#x27;ll just keep using my Mary Kay.</li>
    <li> I cannot tell any difference.  Better products at Ulta that I have used in the past.  Dermalogica.</li>
    <li> I tried this with the recommended La Creme Face Cream and without it. My skin must be too sensitive because I turned a rosey red shade with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend for people with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;See my review of La Creme Face Cream if you want to know more about the type of chemical reaction.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold up to what you claimed it would.  I saw no difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see a real difference with these products.  Usually, I buy organic creams from the same company I buy my vitamins from which I will continue to do.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, both BellaLabs and LaCreme got $87.63 each from my charge card and, yes, they did automatically charge another $87.63 each one month from the first delivery.  If you don&#x27;t have charge card alerts set up, you may really get \\&quot;taken\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;The package information states that you won&#x27;t see a real difference until 8 weeks, so, how can you decide after 14 days if it&#x27;s going to work for you?  I was charged the full price on day 10 after my original purchase - not 14 days afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I also went on the Attorney General&#x27;s site trying to find a way to file a complaint and couldn&#x27;t figure out who to really complain to.&lt;br /&gt;There are several written on their facebook pages, but, do they really see them?</li>
    <li> I was disappointed. Found other product not as expensive and better for my skin.</li>
    <li> Its incredible how many negative reviews there are from people that haven&#x27;t purchased the product from Amazon even. People complaining about being charged monthly and being on a purchase plan DID NOT buy this from Amazon and are venting their anger for their own inability to pay attention when ordering in the wrong spot and manner. I actually did purchase this product at a slight discount, from amazon, in exchange for a honest and unbiased review. After using this for approximately 3 weeks I have seen a noticeable reduction in the appearance of crows feet around my eyes and wrinkles on my forehead. The box says to use everyday for 2 months, and I&#x27;m sure after 2 months the results will be even better but I AM seeing improvements in just 3 weeks. The packaging and product is presented very impressively and has had good results - I have sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t had any issues yet from using this product. Again, don&#x27;t let all the people posting negative reviews that haven&#x27;t even purchased the product (it will say verified purchase on the very top of the review if they actually bought it from Amazon) scare you  away. They&#x27;re just angry because they didn&#x27;t pay attention when ordering it from somewhere else..</li>
    <li> Love the product. Hate the delivery system! You can never get alk the product out of a tall narrow pump bottle. It would be much better in a jar.</li>
    <li> I am not going to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I want to return it.&lt;br /&gt;How?</li>
    <li> DO NOT PURCHASE--this is a SCAM.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference</li>
    <li> This lotion did not live up to the promises made.</li>
    <li> I have been using this, along with La Creme Face Cream and see a noticeable difference in 2 weeks. My lines are less noticeable, dark spots are disappearing and my face feels wonderful and smooth. I have been having problems with my skin tone and this has evened it out. I have tried at least 10 other products with no results, but this product is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Great absorption, wonderful smell. I have used this cream twice a day for about three weeks. I applied mitt in a circular motion as directed. The first thing I noticed, after the wonderful fragrance of course, is how it completely absorbed into my skin....so I used a little more. My face felt smooth and soft. I am 66 years old and beginning to get the sag wrinkles on the sides of my cheeks. The sag wrinkles are beginning to plump and becoming less pronounced. I will have to say that this is one of the better creams I have used in a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;I must thank the company for the opportunity to give you my totally honest opinion of this produce that they sent me at no charge. I will be buying this cream in the future and have already recommended it to several friends.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this cream! It absorbs into the skin pretty fast and its not greasy at all. i have a dry skin and it feels hydrated after applying it. Comes in a nice looking bottle and was shipped and delivered very fast. Very impressed!</li>
    <li> Works really well with La Creme face cream</li>
    <li> been using since Jan, 3 months, can&#x27;t say I see any difference</li>
    <li> It really causes wrinkles to reduce or vanish.  Absorbs almost immediately. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Since starting just over two weeks ago I have noticed that my forehead lines have smoothed out and the one between my eyes has diminished significantly. I have tried so many products in the past year or so since turning 50. This cream works like a miracle.</li>
    <li> TOTAL SCAM!  This company gets its money with their 14 DAY FREE TRIAL offer by starting the TRIAL the day you ORDER it. I got mine and after 9 days I called to cancel because it broke my face out.  They would not issue a refund because I had ORDERED it 15 days ago.  I had a 9 Day trial.  AVOID THIS DISHONEST COMPANY!!!</li>
    <li> I just received this product, it came in very nice packaging, and it smells  like gardenias which I love, it made my face feel nice and soft so I will use it, hope it works as good as it says</li>
    <li> This is the sister company to La Creme!!! It&#x27;s a scam do not buy!!!!!</li>
    <li> Buyer Beware! Caused Breakouts. Sneaky Marketing and Billing on their trial offers. Real charges do not show on Invoice.</li>
    <li> Stay away from this. It&#x27;s all a scam.</li>
    <li> Working nicely. approximately 2 months.  fine lines and wrinkles much diminished.</li>
    <li> Good product.  It does exactly what it says it will do in the length of time it states.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Really Helping my lines. I have purchased every expensive product out there. This isn&#x27;t expensive, and it helps !</li>
    <li> Isn&#x27;t it interesting that the only rave reviews are amazon verified customers and the others that say run away are not?  What a joke</li>
    <li> Really luxurious cream and the packaging (bottle) is quite pretty. The cream has a very distinct smell, almost like sunscreen so if you are sensitive to smells this may take some getting used to. It didn&#x27;t bother me and did smell good. The cream absorbed really quickly into the skin and leaves absolutely no oil or greasy feeling which I loved. The cream is really light and you only need to use a small amount - a little goes a long way. I used this product in the summer and was really pleased with how light it felt and how nicely it went on under my makeup. Hard to say if there was any noticeable change in my wrinkles but I intend to keep using it as I quite like it. I received this cream at no cost in order to review the product honestly.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  It does take longer than 14 days to see results, but it was worth it.</li>
    <li> The face cream is light and does help with average wrinkles. It is better than some but not as good as others. I think it has a bit of an old lady cream odor to it.</li>
    <li> TOTAL SCAM, Stay Away, Do not buy or give your credit card information. They advertise free trial and customer to pay $4.99 . It&#x27;s a total scam they end up charging your card every month $87. I called a few times to cancel and they keep charging my card every month $87.&lt;br /&gt;Total scam in addition I got a really bad rash after using it for a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> THANKYOU FOR HAVING THIS EMERGENCY CREAM</li>
    <li> Great facial cream.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Claims to reduce wrinkles when used with La Crema Face Cream are false!</li>
    <li> Loved it!  Best product I&#x27;ve used ever.</li>
    <li> Felt like the combination of this product and La Creme Face cream tightened my skin momentarily but I could not see any difference after using for a month.</li>
    <li> Scam Alert!!!  Do not buy!!  They promise you a 14 day trial, the wording leading you to believe you have 14 days to try the product, but what they do is begin the 14 day trial  the day you purchase the  product so how they can  call  it 14 day trial is  beyond  me, then they charge you $87+  14 DAYS FROM THE  DAY YOU PURCHASE IT, and refuse to give you a refund,  though after A STRESSFUL AND HEADACHE CAUSING AMOUNT OF argument finally refunded half the amount and would refund the other  after I shipped the product back.  The customer representatives are rude and belligerent. I felt like I was back in junior high school  dealing with this person.  What  a hassle.  Product is  loaded with parabens which are  terrible  for  you.</li>
    <li> DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY OR ITS TWIN SISTER, LA CREME. They operate a shameful and manipulative &amp;#34;free trial&amp;#34; scam.  Even if the product were terrific (which it most certainly is not), the deceptive tactics of hiding a dense and complicated &amp;#34;Terms and Conditions&amp;#34; contract which you unwittingly agree to (when you think you are simply trying out a new product for the cost of shipping) should scream loud and clear that these people are not interested in satisfied repeat customers. They are interested in tricking you so they can &amp;#34;legally&amp;#34; charge your credit card $83 on the 15th day from the date of your order. Both La Creme and BellaLabs products are made with a long list of questionable chemical ingredients (no fewer than 6 forms of parabens in the BellaLabs product) and the fragrance is so overpowering I was forced to wash the stuff off almost immediately. It is cheap, pore-clogging gunk. Cancel your credit card if you made the mistake of giving it to these lawerly shysters. Zero stars if I could!</li>
    <li> Bought it, and I knew better, being an Esthetician, but I thought I would try the sample, that turned into $80 some dollars, because I threw it in my closet and forgot about it. Then I saw my bank statement and realized it was a monthly bill. Canceled it, tried it, and though it smells pretty, that&#x27;s the best thing about this product. My facial skin  was dry and I produced a rash around my laugh lines. Pure Junk!  In order to submit this review I had to give it a star rating, I am reluctantly giving it 1star because I had too. It should have no atar whatsoever .</li>
    <li> It is a very good product. I use it for a month, and feel the cream smooth my skin. It is better than the cream that I used before.</li>
    <li> Really nice product when used with the La Crème face cream.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff. It really works!</li>
    <li> This cream caused an allergic skin reaction. You will not get a full refund if dissatisfied with this skin product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, but one of the ingredients is titanium dioxide which I prefer not to put on my skin or eat.  SDo I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Using with LaCreme face cream and am seeing a real improvement in my skin tone and texture.</li>
    <li> Not what I hoped . So I won&#x27;t be ordering anymore.</li>
    <li> I want to stop! I don&#x27;t want to receive more creams and i don&#x27;t to pay more than I already did. No stars!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a year, and my skin has never looked better.</li>
    <li> This product seems to be very good. It smells and feels good!! The only reason I am giving it a 4 star is the fact I have not used it long enough to reals we the full potential. This product  was given to me for free with the understanding of a true review.</li>
    <li> Before purchasing BellLabs I attempted to research the actual ingredients. Interestingly enough, the ingredients were elusive. Hopefully someone else will have had better luck. When I received my purchase, I found the ingredients to be unimpressive. Nothing special whatsoever. Had I have known this I would NOT have spent forty-something. Your skin is your skin, start early on protecting it, don&#x27;t count on a fancy named cream to turn back time! Of course I knew this but was looking for a really nice cream. I&#x27;ll stick with Aveeno. New Years resolution: Stop buying stupid expensive creams!</li>
    <li> Have not had time to see if it works well.  Takes about 2 or more weeks to show improvement. A</li>
    <li> This BellaLabs Facial Cream is good on my face, im using this in just weeks ago, but you can see the difference, my face is smooth, so more acne,its not oily..i always feel refreshment when i use this product, its a big help on my face, because i have totally sensitive skin.It come from a very nice packaging it looks very elegant and fancy.I like the smell too its too mild. It also doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on your face like some facial creams do.. I received this facial cream in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Total scam - Advertised for $4.95 only pay shipping cost try for free. What it does not say is in two weeks from purchase NOT DATE OF DELEVERLY they charge your credit card $87.63 a month until you contact them at&lt;br /&gt;877 767 9942 Monday – Friday 7:00 AM to 4:00 PM cancel and return product.&lt;br /&gt;First time I tried this cream it made my skin red and burned.&lt;br /&gt;If you read the ingredients it’s made of the cheapest ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;The FDA says it’s illegal to make unjustified clams it takes 10 years off your skin in just 8 weeks</li>
    <li> Best face cream I have ever used.</li>
    <li> OMG!!! What a scam!  I filled out a brief survey in June  while on the Amazon website.  Then supposedly to be rewarded for filling it out, I was given the choice of one of three products as a &amp;#34;thank you&amp;#34;.  I picked the Bellalabs Facial Cream at a cost of $4.95 shipping cost.  I received the cream....nothing special and mostly bottle weight.  The big surprise came the next month on my credit card statement - $87.63 form Bellalabs!  I called this morning and they said I had to have checked a box stating I understood the conditions to be a trial period of 14 days starting the day it was ordered and that there was a card with this info with the bottle I received.  This is flat out UNTRUE.  They had also billed me for another bottle $87.63 that is on its way to me and is also charged on my card.  They were nice enough (NOT) to take off the second $87.63 if I return the next bottle to them.&lt;br /&gt;Buyer Beware!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent for around the eyes,,seems to remove and smooth out wrinkles</li>
    <li> I noticed a real difference after using the cream a week or so. My skin tone had definitely improved. My skin feels firmer, some of my fine lines have diminished. Good product that works.</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT ,, HAPPY</li>
    <li> Bella Labs Facial Cream takes time to work. The product seems to smooth the facial skin and eliminate crows feet at the corner of the eyes. After two weeks of using the cream at night and in the morning, I noticed a little improvement. After using the product for two months twice a day, I definitely noticed smooth skin that seemed to be tighter--no sagging. After I apply BellaLabs, I wait a few minutes, and then I apply a moisturizing cream. Next, I use my foundation and that&#x27;s when my skin develops a glow.</li>
    <li> I have this product as a gift, I really like the style and  it feels really good on my face I enjoy this project</li>
    <li> Just another cream....nothing special</li>
    <li> This would be the first product I&#x27;ve tired of BellaLabs and it is really nice.  I received this product in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;Results took a bit over 3 weeks to show and that is normal as each person has a different skin type.  When apply, the facial cream makes the skin feels smooth, refreshed and very soft.  I use the facial cream daily - AM time only along with sun screen.  I apply make up on top and had no issue with that what so ever.</li>
    <li> Works great with LaCreme face cream.</li>
    <li> I am using BellaLabs&#x27; Facial Cream in conjunction with their La Crème Facial Cream, and I have noticed a difference in the appearance of fine lines. I have only used it since December and BellaLabs suggests to try it for at least two months to notice a difference.  I am very happy with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I am 68 yrs old and nothing takes wrinkles away using a cream or lotion but I do like&lt;br /&gt;how it softens my skin and it works well under makeup. It is much cheaper to buy on&lt;br /&gt;amazon than the high price ordering the trial size and then getting billed for double the price&lt;br /&gt;that was advertized on a add on the internet.</li>
