      <li>(SP?)&lt;br /&gt; palette in warm 1</li>
      <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles feel nice and are non abrasive to my face.</li>
      <li>Time and again, the Shiseido brush was the top pick, so I found the best price at Amazon, and bought it, along with a few others, and this brush continues to be the best for blending foundation, no matter what type.</li>

      <li>Love the brush.  </li>
      <li>It has all of the makings for a perfect foundation brush, but personally I didn&#x27;t feel like it delivered.</li>
      <li>This works so much better. :)</li>
      <li>but so well put together and versatile.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy and experience the multifuctional brush!  :-)</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love this brush.</li>
      <li>but now i stick with ecotools foundation brush instead of this shiseido foundation brush, because i found ecotools is much more convenient and faster to apply on face.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for 5 months and washed it many times.</li>
      <li>Alllll of the beauty sites were IN LOVE with this brush.</li>
      <li>It works magically with liquid foundation.</li>
      <li>applies foundation SO smoothly!</li>
      <li>Love, Love, Love.  </li>
      <li>It makes foundation look smoother and more even.</li>
      <li>I love the way it applies foundation so easily and effortlessly.  </li>
      <li>A quick rundown of the product, special soft brush, the modelling is very beautiful.</li>
      <li>The brush is not large, but I found it the perfect size for me to apply foundation.</li>
      <li>I would not buy it again since I found a better foundation brush in Sedona Lace for a much lower price and better application with it!</li>
      <li>This brush is so easy to use and it blends so well.</li>
      <li>Amazing, I have it for 2 years still like new , love it</li>
      <li>The brush spreads the foundation evenly and smoothly.</li>
      <li>No shading, precise shape and size.</li>
      <li>I love this brush so much!</li>
      <li>Not the best  too small</li>
      <li>take care of it and it WILL take care of you, keep it clean and keep it dry, it&#x27;s a beautifully made brush, I absolutely adore it!!</li>
      <li>it is cool when you apply your foundatin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does take longer to blend and apply a full face of makeup</li>
      <li>and I use full coverage liquid foundation.</li>
      <li>, It doesn&#x27;t leave streaks, just not as fast and easy as I would like.</li>
      <li>Bristles are soft and easy to clean.</li>
      <li>wow, I used to be that girl who ONLY used her hands, but this brush is magic!!</li>
      <li>, the stiffness of brush hair will increase the movement of skin which makes skin grow older faster!!</li>
      <li>This is my favorite brush and is second to my beauty blender.</li>
      <li>dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is on the pricey side, but you pay extra for a premium brush :)</li>
      <li>I first put my liquid foundation on my hand, dip my brush in it, and then apply it to my face.</li>
      <li>especially the liquid concealer :)</li>
      <li>Thanks for the seller&#x27;s gift, I like it very much.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend and felt it was worth the cost.</li>
      <li>super soft!</li>
      <li>love the size of handheld and soft but strong enough natural hair to apply any foundation.</li>
      <li>Brush is soft enough and easy to use !</li>
      <li>This brush was highly recommended to me by a professional makeup artist, and it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
      <li>I purchased myself one and raved about it so much at work.&lt;br /&gt;Later....</li>
      <li>Because of its shape and density it really covers every pore.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>It feels really silky on the skin.</li>
      <li>It also does not pick up too much foundation, so majority of the foundation is on your face (not the brush).</li>
      <li>but that doesn&#x27;t matter a whole lot to</li>
      <li>For that price, I expected better application with it.</li>
      <li>but ecotools is too big to apply foundation around the eye area, shiseido can do this precisely though</li>
      <li>I am waiting for this foundation brush, it is a replacement of my older brush.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this brush.</li>
      <li>Evenly applies make-up, never a brush mark, never a thick spot on the skin.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super soft and works well, I was just looking for something bigger.</li>
      <li>A little small, but it does makeyour makeup look nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>Still looks new.</li>
      <li>I have other brushes from different companies (dior, mac and even sigma) that I feel blend out much better than this brush.</li>
      <li>Previously I used a flat paddle foundation brush and abandoned it because it just sloshed the product around - using my hands was a better process.  </li>
      <li>I like to use big circular patters and blend fast and all over the face</li>
      <li>The brush is synthetic and soft.</li>
      <li>so you can only do so much of your face at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>in mind, it does take about 2 days for the bristles to completely air</li>
      <li>My one gripe about it is that it takes TWO whole days to dry.</li>
      <li>t4echnique is to dab at the face lightly and move along covering only the areas you want or need some coverage for a blemish or uneven skin tone or all over</li>
      <li>I was skeptical, but I really love it now that I have it!</li>

    <li> works beautifully and doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
    <li> For that price, I expected better application with it. I would not buy it again since I found a better foundation brush in Sedona Lace for a much lower price and better application with it!</li>
    <li> Best brush I ever had. If I had to pick only one brush from all brushes I have, would be this Shiseido foundation brush. No shading, precise shape and size.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It is perfect and does apply my foundation as if it is airbrushed. I have been using it for 5 months and washed it many times. Still looks new.</li>
    <li> gotta get this foundation / BB cream applier/cream or liquid to powder tinted moisturizer etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The t4echnique is to dab at the face lightly and move along covering only the areas you want or need some coverage for a blemish or uneven skin tone or all over if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it does give a barely there makeup fee and look, I used only 2 pea sized drops of grafftobian (bougth here ) (SP?)&lt;br /&gt; palette in warm 1 and it looks like air brushing</li>
    <li> A little small, but it does makeyour makeup look nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but I really love it now that I have it!</li>
    <li> I was a bit surprised at the, to me, small size of the handle, but it definitely isn&#x27;t much of a handicap for this brush. I apply liquid foundation by stippling it into the skin, then afterwards buffing over the entire face in small circular motions with the same brush to erase imperfections in the application. This brush handles the job wonderfully. The bristles are definitely dense enough for the pressure of both stippling and buffing, and I haven&#x27;t seen any wear and tear after several weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Before I purchased any foundation brush, I did alot of online investigation. Time and again, the Shiseido brush was the top pick, so I found the best price at Amazon, and bought it, along with a few others, and this brush continues to be the best for blending foundation, no matter what type. I have used it with bb cream, pressed powder, loose powder and liquid full-coverage foundation, and it deserves its top rank. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite brush and is second to my beauty blender. It does not leave any brush strokes and blends flawlessly. My one gripe about it is that it takes TWO whole days to dry. Have back up foundation brushes to use and don&#x27;t rely on this one everyday.</li>
    <li> I love this brush, it goes with every foundation that I have, even sun screens! It makes the makeup look so even and I&#x27;m in love!</li>
    <li> I bought this at Macy&#x27;s and wish I had checked Amazon.  That being said, perfect for a flawless foundation finish!</li>
    <li> I am a make up lover and I use full coverage liquid foundation. I first put my liquid foundation on my hand, dip my brush in it, and then apply it to my face. This brush is just too small for me. I can understand the appeal for others, but for me it just did not work. I like to use big circular patters and blend fast and all over the face but this brush tip is about the size of a penny so you can only do so much of your face at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The WAY I apply my make up might be why this brush isn&#x27;t for me. When I did try it, it applied well just, It doesn&#x27;t leave streaks, just not as fast and easy as I would like. If you don&#x27;t mind a small brush then go for it.</li>
    <li> Spreads mineral makeup very smoothly across skin.  This brush was highly recommended to me by a professional makeup artist, and it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> I just thought this would be bigger... it&#x27;s a very small brush.  It&#x27;s super soft and works well, I was just looking for something bigger.</li>
    <li> The best foundation brush...ever!  You won&#x27;t be sorry. The brush is cut to a great point which is always a plus when applying makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for some time. It feels really silky on the skin. Love it! It&#x27;s my best foundation brush now.</li>
    <li> The product was received well packaged and in a timely manner.  It was purchased based on a recommendation of a You Tube video tutorial on makeup application.  It works well!!!  Will use this supplier again</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about plunking down the money for this brush...I&#x27;ve have brushes fall apart, and I hoped that this brush was of superior quality.  it is.  I love the way it applies foundation so easily and effortlessly.  I made a wise choice in purchasing this brush and I am well pleased.</li>
    <li> Best brush ever! super soft!</li>
    <li> applies foundation SO smoothly! wow, I used to be that girl who ONLY used her hands, but this brush is magic!! take care of it and it WILL take care of you, keep it clean and keep it dry, it&#x27;s a beautifully made brush, I absolutely adore it!!</li>
    <li> Thanks for the seller&#x27;s gift, I like it very much. A quick rundown of the product, special soft brush, the modelling is very beautiful. Really love it!</li>
    <li> great for around the nose</li>
    <li> terrible, sending back!</li>
    <li> I use this brush to apply my foundation. No streaks and makeup is very easy to move around and blend on my face. Everyone should have at least one of these to add to their collection of makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> Love the brush.  I use it every day.  I use it for liquid foundation.  I highly recommend and felt it was worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Amazing, I have it for 2 years still like new , love it</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this brush could make such a difference.  It makes me look airbrushed.  Previously I used a flat paddle foundation brush and abandoned it because it just sloshed the product around - using my hands was a better process.  Because of its shape and density it really covers every pore.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s amazing! Brush is soft enough and easy to use ! I can&#x27;t love it more! I think I&#x27;ll be the fans!</li>
    <li> Evenly applies make-up, never a brush mark, never a thick spot on the skin.  I hope this lasts a long time for the money, but so far it&#x27;s everything reviewers said!</li>
    <li> I am waiting for this foundation brush, it is a replacement of my older brush. This is a present to myself! Beatriz</li>
    <li> Love it. It makes foundation look smoother and more even. I used to just use my hands or a sponge to apply. This works so much better. :)</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research on foundation brushes before purchasing this brush. Alllll of the beauty sites were IN LOVE with this brush. So I went to macy&#x27;s and saw it in person. The brush is synthetic and soft. It&#x27;s also short bristle and dense. It has all of the makings for a perfect foundation brush, but personally I didn&#x27;t feel like it delivered. I have other brushes from different companies (dior, mac and even sigma) that I feel blend out much better than this brush. It&#x27;s still a great brush- and if you are looking to build your brush collection, can definitely have a spot. But if you are looking for only one foundation brush- this isn&#x27;t the one.</li>
    <li> I love this brush so much! I bought mine from Sephora. It works magically with liquid foundation. The brush spreads the foundation evenly and smoothly. It also does not pick up too much foundation, so majority of the foundation is on your face (not the brush). The brush is not large, but I found it the perfect size for me to apply foundation. Bristles are soft and easy to clean. No hairs fell off, which indicates good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind, it does take about 2 days for the bristles to completely air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is on the pricey side, but you pay extra for a premium brush :)</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! Goes well with the same brand foundation. This brush is so easy to use and it blends so well. I know why it won the Allure&#x27;s best product now. I highly recommend this brush. It&#x27;s so small so you can fit it in anything! This is a must have brush for me.</li>
    <li> Best foundation brush ever! It has a short handle for easi use and the angle of thr brush head is perfect for application... Love it!</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love.  I purchased myself one and raved about it so much at work.&lt;br /&gt;Later.... I purchased another one for a co-worker of mine, as a present.&lt;br /&gt;This is far one of the very best brushes and favorite of all my makeup brushes!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Every makeup Artist to novice should own this brush.  It is a bit pricey... but so well put together and versatile.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy and experience the multifuctional brush!  :-)</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used a makeup brush this dense before. I have used the  traditional makeup brush and before that I used makeup sponges.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like the dense brush helps me blend out easier and gets into my eye area easily.&lt;br /&gt;It does take longer to blend and apply a full face of makeup but that doesn&#x27;t matter a whole lot to me.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles feel nice and are non abrasive to my face.</li>
    <li> Not the best  too small</li>
    <li> it is cool when you apply your foundatin. However, since the hair are short, so it&#x27;s really hard to wash.</li>
    <li> love the size of handheld and soft but strong enough natural hair to apply any foundation. especially the liquid concealer :) i have sensitive skin and not allergic (my face don&#x27;t feel painful) after the frequent movement of this brush. it was handmade in japan, excellent craftsmanship! but now i stick with ecotools foundation brush instead of this shiseido foundation brush, because i found ecotools is much more convenient and faster to apply on face. also, it&#x27;s cruel free and under $10. and this shiseido is too stiff comparing to ecotools, the stiffness of brush hair will increase the movement of skin which makes skin grow older faster!! but ecotools is too big to apply foundation around the eye area, shiseido can do this precisely though</li>
    <li> Very nice brush. Easy to use and makes liquid foundation flawless.</li>
