      <li>Good for elbows and hands too.</li>
      <li>Smells really good.  </li>
      <li>It has a creamy, not greasy consistency that feels good,</li>
      <li>So, before sleeping, I always wash my feet and apply a good foot creme, this has been a part of my nightly routine for years.</li>
      <li>Good stuff.</li>
      <li>, I would suggest to give it a try; it&#x27;s still a good product.</li>
      <li>The tea tree oil seems to offer a good antiseptic effect.</li>
      <li>which I LOVED a lot, I wanted to stock up on it for my tender feet but instead found this product which DOESN&#x27;T have their exfoliating alpha hydroxy ingredients</li>
      <li>The peppermint makes it feel good on the skin.</li>
      <li>i used to have perfect feet when i was using hempz original lotion..</li>
      <li>Refreshing on your foot and smells good too!</li>

      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>My feet love it!</li>
      <li>If you own Paul Mitchell&#x27;s or Giovanni&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil Shampoo or Conditioner, this doesn&#x27;t smell invigorating like those products.  </li>
      <li>, It has a nice fragrance too, that is acceptable for men.</li>
      <li>Give the feet a nice cooling feeling and also softens..</li>
      <li>We own and lawn service and we walk a lot.  </li>
      <li>This product is as promised, soothing and nice scent.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my best friend and she absolutely loves it.</li>
      <li>They were also kind of greasy</li>

      <li>This is the best foot balm, highly recommend.</li>
      <li>VERY strong pudgent oder.</li>
      <li>The smell is wonderful and the product works wonders...use it once a day and your feet will be baby soft before you know it!  </li>
      <li>In summary, I liked the this product for a body lotion more than for an overnight foot cream.</li>
      <li>Perfect amount of Tea Tree and makes my feet feel silky and young.  </li>
      <li>but this part of my regimen is probably the most effective.</li>
      <li>It has cleared it up, softened the heel and the smell is very nice not overly powerful.</li>
      <li>A GOOD IDEA: Unless you have just stepped out of the tub or shower, be sure to clean you feet with baby wipes or a wash cloth before applying the Foot Repair Balm and, of course, you must use a foot buffer</li>
      <li>This cream nourishes my skin so well that even the fine lines are gone!</li>
      <li>After reading all of the reviews that made this sound like the best foot moisturizer on earth, I decided to try it despite its relatively high price.  </li>
      <li>This lotion smells great too - it has a very aromatherapy type scent, but isn&#x27;t overwhelming to put it on your hands.  </li>
      <li>So light but effective.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soothing and refreshing and I like the smell.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t need to be used more often IMO, since it has immediate effectiveness.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought a tube of this for my wife who stands all day, and this really does the trick: it moisturizes, it relaxes, and it smells great!</li>
    <li> I bought this in conjunction with the Moisturizing Foot Socks.  Yes, my &#x27;just beginning to crack&#x27; heels have reversed themselves so it does work at least if you catch it early enough.  However, I was expecting the lotion to smell like Tea Tree Oil which I love, &amp; it doesn&#x27;t.  It is ok to smell.  At least it is not a strong perfume smell which I am sensitive to.  So you will like it for that if you too have an aversion to strong smells.  But I can&#x27;t say this product is any better than any other lotion I have used.</li>
    <li> This foot cream actually did leave my feet feeling softer and less scaly. Most foot creams and balms are sticky and greasy but this one was refreshing and absorbed quickly and left me feeling super moisturized and revived. Its cooling effect is amazingly relaxing after a long day too!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak highly enough about this wonderful product.  For starters, it really does work wonders.  Whenever I smooth it on my heels [and other rough areas] I feel the tea tree oil and other great ingredients really kicking in.  Afterwards, I put my gel lined jojoba socks on over my feet, and in an hour....MAGIC!  My feet feel so soft.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Again this product is made by the same people as the Gardener&#x27;s Hand  Repair.  Their products are cooling and this one smells wonderful (if you like Tree Tea Oil).  It certainly helps my feet.  It is a joy to use and  a joy on the feet.</li>
    <li> I got it for the husband, who has the nastiest dry cracked skin on his feet you&#x27;ve ever seen. It&#x27;s been a week and things are improving.  That&#x27;s all I can say at this time.</li>
    <li> The product--which really is soothing and healing--is now in a much smaller tube than it used to be packaged in and the shipping price was extremely high.  I have used this product for over 5 years but will have to look for a less expensive replacement. Sorry.</li>
    <li> I live in a dry climate and I used to have such dry, cracked heels that they would split.  It was painful and I had to crazy glue the split skin together until it healed.  For the past couple of years I have used this Foot Repair Balm daily, especially in the summer when my heels can get really dry from walking barefoot or in sandals.  I use it in the morning after a bath and again at night.  It&#x27;s soothing and refreshing and I like the smell.  My feet and heels are much softer and my hands love it too!        A GOOD IDEA: Unless you have just stepped out of the tub or shower, be sure to clean you feet with baby wipes or a wash cloth before applying the Foot Repair Balm and, of course, you must use a foot buffer/sander periodically to remove dead skin.  Do this and your feet will love you.</li>
    <li> Bought this item for my husband who is on his feet 24/7 and has difficult toenails and a sore ankle.  Applying the balm to his ankle definitely seemed to improve blood circulation as the pain diminished and the &#x27;black and blue&#x27; appearance also normalized.  I figured I would try it on my extremely dry skin - even on my face after a day working in the backyard.  It was very soothing and not greasy at all.  Dry, dead skin that I couldn&#x27;t even see flaked off and fine lines are smoother.  I will definitely recommend this - easier to use than Euciren - and goes a long, long way.</li>
    <li> The title speaks for itself. I wont go back to another brand for foot lotion again. I tried 4 other competative brands and even more expensive. Didn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
    <li> This is the best foot lotion that I have found. The antifungal and deodorizing properties of tea tree oil help control odor and athlete&#x27;s foot. The peppermint makes it feel good on the skin. It is a thick moisturizing lotion that has a lasting effect, and I recommend it for really dry feet.</li>
    <li> I first bought this at the Ramstein Air Force Base Exchange in Germany and after moving to the states searched all over for it.  Amazon came to the rescue!  This lotion revitalizes, relaxes and refreshes my feet after being on them for hours at work.  After massaging it in, the ache and pain is gone and I&#x27;m able to sleep.</li>
    <li> Happy, happy camper.  The new (old) formula is back.  Apparently some of an older formula got sent to me by accident.  The current formula is the good stuff, with things you can pronounce and no parabens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said in my first review (below, past the one where I was complaining of the changed formula), it smells great, feels great, and keeps my feet from cracking (a thing that is almost impossible to do).  I was so upset about what I thought was a permanent formula change because THIS STUFF WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company sent me replacement tubes with the good formula and isn&#x27;t even requiring me to send back the tubes that upset me.  Very happy camper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Please read all label information on delivery,\\&quot; says the description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I did, and was shocked.  They have changed the formula drastically since my last order.  I compared it with the empty tube, which I fortunately had not thrown away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The name of the product has even changed (used to be Tea Tree Oil Foot Repair Balm, now is Tea Tree Oil Foot Balm), though the basic look of the tube has not.  It has also acquired a product list in French.  I wish I knew the origin of this change, but I don&#x27;t like it whatever the reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are now two kinds of parabens in this stuff - propylparaben and methylparaben.  They really ought to put the ingredient list in the description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also no longer says \\&quot;certified organic\\&quot; nor \\&quot;vegan\\&quot; on the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review, titled \\&quot;Feels good, smells good, seems to control cracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this a while on my terrible feet, and I do believe it is working (i.e. no cracks or dead skin for me to pick at). I love the feel and smell. I put it on my hands and on itchy places as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having used it a longer while - yes, it is the best I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot. If you use it every day your feet will not crack. (Well, at least mine don&#x27;t - I&#x27;ve noticed from reviews that people have different experiences with virtually everything - differences in skin, I guess.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I do use it every day because it feels and smells good. And a tube lasts a loooooong time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uh, I just noticed the product info says it comes from China? The tube says \\&quot;Product of U.S.A.\\&quot; - manufacturer might want to correct this!</li>
    <li> The first evening that I rubbed this foot balm into my clean feet, I noticed that the skin on my feet began to feel smooth almost immediately.  When I went to bed, I wore bed socks, and in the morning I could feel the smoothness on the bottom of my feet. Daily use will make a huge difference in how my feet feel, of course, but soon I will be applying it only two or three times a week. It doesn&#x27;t need to be used more often IMO, since it has immediate effectiveness. To me, this is a wonderful, beneficial product. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Refreshing on your foot and smells good too!</li>
    <li> I am a nurse working 12 hour shifts and deserve some papering at the end of the day. This cream is lovely, with a gentle minty fragrance. This is my second tube. I especially love it because my daughter buys it for me. I think it makes me sleep better when I use it. The only thing that would make it better is if I could get someone else to put it on.</li>
    <li> Forgot all the usual drug store stuff.  This product is both a moisturizer and an anti-fungal b/c of the tea tree oil.  Love the winter mint smell. I use a Ped-Egg to remove all the dead skin from my feet and then apply this Tea Tree Oil Balm to my feet.  They never looked better and healthier.  A great product.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Ugly feet are disgusting, especially in the summers wearing sandals.  This product is a no-brainer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I can now get this from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very effective foot cream.</li>
    <li> This product makes your feet feel sooo cool and refreshing.I use it after every shower and morning prior to putting on my socks and often before going to bed.  Jack,  Palm Bay , Florida 32907</li>
    <li> My husband calls it crack lotion, it works wonders! Both of us are frequently deployed, required to wear boots very often, this lotion heals even the most cracked feet! It smells lovely and your skin just instantly smoothes out! It works best with the entire kit!</li>
    <li> My daughter gave this foot balm as a gift and I really liked it so much that when it was,getting really low I looked it up and ordered this new one through Amazon which delivery and packing was just great.  Thank You.&lt;br /&gt;Dottie</li>
    <li> I swear by this foot cream. It soaks in really nicely, without being greasy and the smell is light and goes away quickly. It really does repair your feet over time and it&#x27;s a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; when I travel and my feet take a total beating. Good for elbows and hands too. The ingredients are pretty natural, no animal testing and a product of the USA. The 6oz lasts a long time even with every day use.</li>
    <li> I just could not get past the smell to really give this product a fair try.  Other people might like it, though.</li>
    <li> I have terrible eczyma on my hands during the winter - if i&#x27;m in and out of the cold a lot, or washing my hands a lot, they get very red and splotchy and itchy.  I had a prescribed medication from the dermatologist that worked some of the time, but no lotion worked at all.  I had a sample of this product laying around from a previous Earth Therapeutics purchase and decided to try it on my hands, figuring they couldn&#x27;t get worse really.  Within a couple days, my hands were almost totally better.  I have since ordered a regular size tube, and keep it by my sink.  This lotion smells great too - it has a very aromatherapy type scent, but isn&#x27;t overwhelming to put it on your hands.  Its just a nice clean smell.</li>
    <li> I bought mine for $3.99 at Ross&#x27;s Dress for Less.  After I bought and reviewed \\&quot;[[ASIN:B000HWZTUM Tea Tree Oil Gentle Foot Peel]]\\&quot; which I LOVED a lot, I wanted to stock up on it for my tender feet but instead found this product which DOESN&#x27;T have their exfoliating alpha hydroxy ingredients but I still bought it since I was impurrressed with Earth Therapeutic&#x27;s purrrfect foot lotions.  One big difference is that the fragrance in THIS product is more herbal mediciny like wintergreen-peppermint rather than fruity like their \\&quot;foot peel\\&quot; product.  Also, calming chamomile and elder blossoms are listed on the top of their ingredients list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use tea tree oil shampoo for my hair since tea tree oil is a great repeller of lice, fungi, bacteria, etc and has healing effects. So I was looking for a foot lotion that would heal my feet and this lotion makes them soft &amp; smoother. I really pound my feet during the day at work and arrive home with tired, sweaty, smelly, dirty feet, especially when I walk around the house barefoot. After I take a bath, I put this on and my feet feel soft, cool, and less painful and it&#x27;s gentle, not stinging, as its packaging ad promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has Australian tea tree oil as a main ingredient and tea tree oil serves as a repellent to fungi, bacteria, etc, all of which contribute to dirty stinky worn out feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as the info on the back of its container says, it also \\&quot;works great for hands, knees elbows and other dry skin areas.\\&quot;  I&#x27;ve rubbed it onto my dry sometimes mildly to moderately painful elbows and they have gotten much more softer and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s their website info:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An oldie but a goodie. Earth Therapeutics enthusiasts swear by our award winning foot balm (2003 SELF Beauty Award declares it a \\&quot;must-have for all women\\&quot;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super rich, nourishing emollients sink deep into skin, healing and hydrating dry, damaged feet without a greasy feel. Natural botanical extracts, including the traditional soothers, aloe vera and chamomile, are added for optimal relief. Plus pure Australian Tea Tree Oil is a natural antiseptic that heals and deodorizes.&lt;br /&gt;----------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not tested on animals and is packaged environmentally green.  On the ingredients&#x27; list for the \\&quot;version\\&quot; I bought there ARE parabens but they&#x27;re listed on the very bottom of the ingredients list.  I noticed on their website that they say they do NOT have parabens so perhaps they reformulated their product that they have on their website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely it&#x27;s worth in price of gold, or ahem.......feet. I&#x27;d use it as an everyday lotion at home, a lotion at work &amp; traveling, and give it as a gift to all my family, friends, neighbors, and coworkers.for optimal relief.

    <li> i love, i love i love this products. i just give it five star because it works more than any other products ever used. i highly recomend this if you have any issues with your foot..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years.  I think it&#x27;s because of the tea tree oil that it works so well and the fragrance is heavenly.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Great for summer time.. Very soothing and just enough tree oil to protect my feet, love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this purely because it had tea tree oil in it. Love tea tree oil and this did not disappoint. I put this on my feet before I go to bed at night and after I&#x27;ve bathed. I liberally massage it into my feet and put a pair of footies on my feet and let it do its magic. It is tingly and refreshing and really relaxing. If the feet are the pathway to one&#x27;s soul/sole, then this is the ideal conduit. I get so relaxed that I nod off quickly. When I wake up my feet are soft and smooth and feel really good. This does wonders for my feet esp. after a day at the beach trdging through hot sand.&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I got a little trial sized pack of this balm when I ordered another product from Earth Therapeutics, and it really made my tired, dry, itchy feet feel smooth, calm and comfortable. Can&#x27;t wait for my full sized tube to arrive, this balm is magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update***&lt;br /&gt;I have the new tube and I love it. It really makes my tired sore feet happy and comfortable again.</li>
    <li> Tea Tree Oil Foot Repair Balm is one of my favorite products. At night before bed I put it all over my feet, my lower legs, and my elbows. My skin has gotten so soft. My husband is ill and has problems with his legs cramping. He loves for me to massage his legs with Tea Tree Oil Foot Repair Balm. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Smells great and non greasy.  Great for hands and feet.</li>
    <li> Love it! Have dealt with cracked, dry feet forever and this is the only product that makes a noticeable difference. So light but effective.</li>
    <li> The best foot cream around. Not greasy and smells awesome!</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Really softens up and makes rough feet smoother.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mother who has diabetes.  She swears by it.</li>
    <li> If you have dry or itchy feet, or live with someone who complains about their feet, buy two. The scent is universal in terms of age or gender, and is not too greasy, absorbed into the skin rapidly. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> a nice healing salve that has helped my cracked heals get much softer and smoother. it is rather greaseless and does not have a strong odor. it leaves my feet feeling sort of refreshed.</li>
    <li> I only just started to use it so cant rate it yet so maybe in a month I can tell</li>
    <li> It smells so wonderful and works wonderfully.  I purchased the package of 3, thinking I probably wouldn&#x27;t use it that often.  But I&#x27;ll be using it every day.</li>
    <li> Best stuff I have found for peeling skin. My wife uses it on her elbows and arms!</li>
    <li> Did not deliver as described.  Take a pass on this product and the Tea Tree foot wash, also.  They do not improve the condition of the skin whatsoever.</li>
    <li> After reading all of the reviews that made this sound like the best foot moisturizer on earth, I decided to try it despite its relatively high price.  It is a nice lotion with a pleasant scent, but the lotion is thin.  I did not feel the expected tea tree \\&quot;tingle.\\&quot; I used it two nights on my very, very dry feet with moisturizing socks.  When I first applied the lotion, my feet soaked it right up, so I felt I had to apply more to \\&quot;bathe\\&quot; my feet overnight.  By morning, my feet felt no better, still itched with dryness and hurt as I put on regular socks and shoes.  Last winter, I used [[ASIN:B0013U5NJO Gold Bond Foot Cream, Triple Action Relief, 4 oz.]] overnight with moisturizing socks.  It is very thick, soothing and after just 2-3 nights I felt like I had new feet.  In comparison to the Earth Therapeutics Tea Tree Oil Foot Balm, the Gold Bond Cream lasts longer because it does more with less product.  In summary, I liked the this product for a body lotion more than for an overnight foot cream.</li>
    <li> Loving this balm! The tea tree oil formula has kept any athlete&#x27;s foot flare-ups at bay. I highly recommend this is you suffer from any fungal skin infections on your feet. (Not toenails)</li>
    <li> This is a decent product for the price you pay.  I like it much better than the foot balm from Burt&#x27;s Bees, at least it doesn&#x27;t smell like tropical suntan lotion.  My skin feels much softer after 1 use, but make sure you buff out dead skin before you apply any foot lotion for it to work.  The smell is not overbearing but it doesn&#x27;t smell anything like tea tree oil.  If you own Paul Mitchell&#x27;s or Giovanni&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil Shampoo or Conditioner, this doesn&#x27;t smell invigorating like those products.  I was expecting a familiar tea tree oil smell or a tingling/invigorating sensation, but it&#x27;s not there.  Other than that, I would suggest to give it a try; it&#x27;s still a good product.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Very soothing</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time and works great have been using this for years and have not found any thing that comes close to working as well.</li>
    <li> This is an acceptable foot lotion, but I prefer Keihl&#x27;s Dry Run Cross Terrain whether it&#x27;s for daily or overnight soothing and smoothing. I don&#x27;t require tea tree oil in my foot lotion so maybe I&#x27;m not into this because of that additive. This lotion is thick so wearing socks is wise lest you be sliding around your house or staining your blankets or sheet linens thanks again to that tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see this stuff sold everywhere! There&#x27;s a huge price disparity too. I recommend if you like this cream to buy the Buy 1 Get 1 50% off at Ulta (in store or online) and apply the easily found $3.50 off $10 purchase coupon they offer. This way you get a good supply at a nice discount.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely amazing and makes your feet feel incredibly soft. I bought my mom this along with some other earth therapeutics products. Although I recommend purchasing this at Ulta it&#x27;s 9 there vs. 14 here .</li>
    <li> great for when you get out of the shower.  Give the feet a nice cooling feeling and also softens.. It wont do miracles thats what a pedicure is for, but it will maintain the feet.  Love it</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t see that this product had any appreciable positive effect on my feet. I won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Foot Balm you can count on!</li>
    <li> This stuff is a godsend. I use it every day on my feet-- and recently I started using it on my shoulders, chest, face, anywhere I want to soften up and rejuvenate, esp after sun exposure. It smells light and minty and is so soothing</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!! I had very dry skin on my forearms and what looked the beginning of what they call in the elderly &amp;#34;paper skin&amp;#34;. This cream nourishes my skin so well that even the fine lines are gone! I use it everywhere. My dry feet are soft and beautiful now also. Seemed to have helped my mild nail fungus also, I read in another review that it helped that for someone else. Part of the reason I bought it in the first place.. Really miracle stuff.  Expensive but really, realy worth it. Has a minty eucalyptus smell that I don&#x27;t mind at all.</li>
    <li> Great product, love it!</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT!!!! I love this. I bought it because tge heels of my feet were beginning to crack. It has cleared it up, softened the heel and the smell is very nice not overly powerful.</li>
    <li> I have used this several times over the years and it does wonders to keep your feet smooth, I use after I have soaked and removed any rough spots on my feet</li>
    <li> My feet absolutely love this product!!  One word of warning though.  You only need to use a little bit, as a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love this foot lotion.  Perfect amount of Tea Tree and makes my feet feel silky and young.  I have bought this at Ulta (small bottle for around the same price per ounce) but with Prime (free shipping) and the larger volume, it saves me trips to buy more. I&#x27;ll never use anything else on my feet!  The Tea Tree helps with foot fungus as well and has help to clear up my toes with daily use.</li>
    <li> The package arrived on time and well packaged. The balm keeps my feet, smooth and supple. You cant go wrong by buying this product. It is awesome. I totally recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> Made difference on my dry skin.</li>
    <li> I was a little reluctant to purchase foot balm, but my feet are rough and maybe a little stinky. From the very first application of the Earth Therapeutics Tea Tree Oil, my feet were feeling softer and smelled much better. The roughness that I usually notice when my feet rub against my legs while I&#x27;m nesting into bed has disappeared, and my feet are visibly better looking. I am using this product in conjunction with a foot soap, and I would recommend using this product in conjunction with a good soap.</li>
    <li> My feet are horrible.  Wait, not just horrible but HORRIBLE!!!  Extremely thick calluses and dried skin . . . yuck!  This stuff works great.  However, I must say that I have also been really working on my feet lately with a rasp, foot bath, and foot bath salts . . . but this part of my regimen is probably the most effective.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Smells really good.  Makes your feet feel good.  Isn&#x27;t greasy at all.  Definitely helps with cracked heals.</li>
    <li> I was expecting more from this product. I like it makes my foot feel soft for the moment but it&#x27;s no miracle. Your feet will become dry again or rough when you stop using it. No point in purchasing again. Just get a moisturizing cream.</li>
    <li> I bmgot this as a gift a few years ago and used it sparsely because I didn&#x27;t know if I could find it again. I&#x27;m so happy to have found it online. It feels cool and leaves your feet smooth. If I could only get my husband to rub my feet ;)</li>
    <li> kept my feet very moist</li>
    <li> Wonderful for tired dry feet. Helps to keep foot problems away. The tree oil is therapeutic and the cream chases away dryness.</li>
    <li> The tea tree oil makes this a winner ! The tea tree oil seems to offer a good antiseptic effect. A great combination of ingredients !</li>
    <li> The Earth Therapeutics Tea Tree Oil Foot Balm is like satin to put on you feet, and if you do it every night, the roughness really disappears and feet feel like a dream!</li>
    <li> When my favorite foot cream (got2b soothing soles) was nowhere to be found, I searched for a replacement. I saw this at amazon with really great reviews and I generally tend to like Tea Tree ingredient in products so I ordered this one. Now, my feet are in pretty decent shape to begin with. I don&#x27;t have any calluses or cracked heels etc. Maybe just a little dry skin and and tired feet at the end of the day. So, before sleeping, I always wash my feet and apply a good foot creme, this has been a part of my nightly routine for years. When I used this foot balm, I didn&#x27;t feel any relaxing or soothing sensation. It absorbed well but it was just like any other cream. I didn&#x27;t find it anything special. My bath and body works lotion worked better on my feet for moisturizing purpose. I wont order this again and will keep looking for my favorite one that used to make my tired feet sigh with cooling relief.</li>
    <li> My dry winter feet love this balm!&lt;br /&gt;It feels so refreshing and is a great product I would recommend this product,</li>
    <li> Great for feet.  I hate using athlete&#x27;s foot cream.  This stuff works for me and it&#x27;s a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> This is freaky stuff. It says it&#x27;s foot balm, whatever that is. My wife and daughters use it to relieve sore muscles. So sore that they can&#x27;t sleep at night, but then they rub this stuff on and BAM, the pain either disappears or dials back to low intensity. Personally, I don&#x27;t like lotions, they make me feel sticky, but I&#x27;ve used it a couple times and it works on sore feet and aching back.</li>
    <li> Lovely light cream that lasts long enough for a massage, but disappears into the skin leaving no greasy aftertaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrant. Citrusy with a note of mint. Quite pleasant. Have used this cream for years....</li>
    <li> I bought this to address dry, cracked, and burning toes and side of feet that I seem to get when I use the showers at the gym.  I can rub my feet with this balm before I go to bed, and when I wake up, my feet are soft and smooth!  I also used this on the skin in the armpits.  I developed a little rash there from anti-perspirant irritation.  At night, before bed, take a shower to remove anti-perspirant from the skin.  Rub this under armpits.  Since it is a deodorizing tea-tree, it will give the same effect as a deodarant, but will repair dry and rashed skin.  I love this product.  It is designed for feet, but I think you can use it anywhere you have dry, cracked skin.</li>
    <li> What else can I say, it does not work. A moisturizer from walmart works better. I was excited to get this, but was extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have dry feet and has been looking for a good natural cream. I bought the Earth Therapeutics Tea Tree Oil Foot Balm because the positive reviews. It is very thin and does not work for me at all.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My husband is a severe stroke victium. We use it everyday on his feet everyday. We could not do without it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to see if I could get this product on Amazon, and you can, at twice the price!!!  Its the best foot cream on the market, a little but goes a long way and the scent it amazing. I just wish it was more reasonable on here. Shame.</li>
    <li> My husband uses it daily for his tired feet.  We own and lawn service and we walk a lot.  We have used a lot of different lotions but have found that the ones with tea tree oil work the best.</li>
    <li> I love this foot cream! It really works and makes my feet feel great!</li>
    <li> The best for my feet.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. I&#x27;ve tried a number of other foot creams in winter for my dry, cracking heels but was never really satisfied. The results were always minimal and very temporary. They were also kind of greasy and I had to apply them every day. In contrast, after only a few days of using Earth Therapeutics Tea Tree Foot Balm, the cracking has disappeared! My heels are so soft and smooth. It sinks into the skin instead just sitting on the surface, and is not greasy at all. I&#x27;m so glad I decided to try it based on the other reviews here. I love this product. It really works and I hope they never stop making it.</li>
    <li> A little too harsh for my sensitive skin.....sooooooo many ingredients/oils/extracts etc.</li>
    <li> This product is as promised, soothing and nice scent. My feet love it! My hands love it too! Other reviews convinced me to try it and I&#x27;m glad I did. Not oily at all.</li>
    <li> This IS awesome foot balm. HOWEVER, read the label very carefully. It contains parabens! Legitimate natural products do not include these dangerous substances.</li>
    <li> This foot lotion really helps me. I used to have issues with my feet being dry and cracked. Using this every day really helps. I wear flats without socks nearly every day so my shoes and feet have been known to get a little smelly. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the lotion or the fact that it isn&#x27;t the rainy season anymore, but my shoes and feet smell fine now.</li>
    <li> I used it and reordered it several times.  I recommended it to others and know they also ordered Tea Tree Oil and are still using it.  They thank me for recommending it.</li>
    <li> It works okay, keeps my feet from getting too dry. However, I am not into the smell and I am looking for a more creamy, thicker type. Gets the job done but I probably will keep looking for the perfect one.</li>
    <li> I discovered this product in college and have never found another that I love more.  The smell is wonderful and the product works wonders...use it once a day and your feet will be baby soft before you know it!  This entire line is wonderful. Men, if you&#x27;re looking to pamper your lady, get her the pedicure kit by this company and I promise she will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This product contains many natural healing ingredients to help sooth and smooth your feet.  It has a creamy, not greasy consistency that feels good,</li>
    <li> This is my favorite foot lotion. I use it with the Earth Therapeutic booties and they both work great. I also love the smell.</li>
    <li> This foot balm works better than any other foot balm/lotion I have tried. I apply the balm to my feet as soon as I get out of the shower and put socks on. If you are looking to a better foot lotion than what you are currently using, I would highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> love this product, keeps my feet soft</li>
    <li> Wonderful, wonderful.  This stuff rocks.  My very mature feet have never looked or felt better.  It removed redness and brown spots also.  I am using on my hands, elbows and knees.  A great buy.</li>
    <li> This is the best foot balm for me.  I have tried a couple of other foot balm products that don&#x27;t work as good.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice, light product but is also healing, and moisturizing for feet., It has a nice fragrance too, that is acceptable for men.</li>
    <li> VERY strong pudgent oder. so much so I can not use it at all, tree oil mixed with some other oils like ecalipitis or some form. very strong oder, worse then vicks vapor run.</li>
    <li> i have diabetes and my feet are like sand paper at times.  This product is at the top of my list for must have&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my best friend and she absolutely loves it. She&#x27;s said it makes a huge difference on her dry skin and she really likes the smell. She has really sensitive skin and the balm was not irritating at all.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It goes on smoothly and rubs in without feeling greasy. It has a minty scent and reminds me of smell of a day spa. I bought this at Marshalls for 3.99....for this size,I don&#x27;t know if I would pay 12.99 :/</li>
    <li> I found this cream to be too too thin/runny to be effective. Even when used with the socks my feet/heels were not made softer</li>
    <li> This is the best foot balm, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is some of the best foot cream my wife has every used. it is something she got as a gift a long time ago and a little really goes a long way. really good stuff and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I got Tinea versicolor this summer for first time and tried the selson blue which worked but not fully. So i heard tea tree oil can help and noticed  my girl had  this lotion  so i tried it all over  head neck chest and arms. Wihin a week my tinea versicolor was gone and my skin felt sooo good. It not only has tee tree oil but aloe and chamomile which are all anti fungal properties. I now use it  as my normal lotion also. I am balding so i shave my head and use this as after shave,lotion for arms legs face etc.. Its non greasy when i sweat it doesnt drip or get greasy wet, and also doesnt make me hot like other lotions  do. Highly recommend and for tinea versicolor sufferers try and you will be pleased.</li>
    <li> So far, so good! Having been using this lotion on my feet for almost a week and do see quite an improvement so far! Was going to order 2 of these after reading other reviews but thought I had better try it first! Would I buy this again? YES, as it is just as good as any of the other lotions I have tried!</li>
    <li> Excellent for so many skin problems beyond your feet.</li>
    <li> I ordered the tea tree foot balm which I have used in the past and completely love!! But instead of recieving what I had ordered, I recieved a bottle of some other &amp;#34;hand remedy&amp;#34; which is not as good of a product. Very disappointing. If I had gotten the tea tree foot balm it would have 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I love it, though I wish it moisturized better; diabetic feet demand more moisture, but yeah, the tea tree will keep infections at bay, so I mix it with oil and other lotions.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT product (not overstated)!  Product worked wonders for my dry feet problems - no more crusty feet.  Feet are now soft with no cracks.  The product is also great for your sking.  I use it daily!  It lasts a long time and it &amp;#34;beats&amp;#34;, hands down, over-the-counter &amp; doctor prescribed foot remidies that I tried over the years.  I&#x27;m a beliver.  A++++</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF MAKES MY FEET SO SOFT</li>
    <li> On my second bottle. My skin says thank you whenever I apply it. Awesome product</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It keeps my feet soft and uncallused.</li>
    <li> Very good product for rough and dry feet.</li>
    <li> I just moved to arizona from utah and my feet super dried out... i used to have perfect feet when i was using hempz original lotion.. then i moved and couldnt find my lotion so i looked here online and saw this and thought it was over priced.. so i went to ross and found it for 4.99 and bought it there and ive been using it for over a month now and my feet are still scratchy... i put it on at night and wear fuzzy socks over my feet when i sleep cause it seems to work with this stuff a little better.. but barely a difference.. some healing is going on but not smooth like they used to be... so i will not be buying this stuff again... (doesn&#x27;t smell good either)i am going to give O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Healthy Feet Creme a try and see how that goes i will ordering that sometime in the next 24 hours and will be reviewing that aswell..</li>
