<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for years and love it. It has s very light, clean &amp; fresh smell, not flowery at all.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this and get so many compliments on it!</li>
    <li> My favorite smell. Has a clean fresh powder smell with a flowery undertone. I get compliments when I wear it by guys and gals.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this perfume and I still love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This scent is beautiful and last all day long I just am so happy with it all.</li>
    <li> I used to wear this when I was in high school.  A customer came into the bakery I work in wearing it. When I did her order I was immediately was taken back in time. I asked if she was wearing Glow. Since then I had to get it again. And I still love it! Smell is very clean and pretty. I keep smelling myself and smiling. :)</li>
    <li> Very good company .. Nice to deal with</li>
    <li> I love J.Lo&#x27;s Glow!  It&#x27;s the first perfume that I&#x27;ve found that can stay with me the entire day -- when I lie down to sleep at night, I can still smell it on my skin!  It&#x27;s a wonderful scent with a hint of floral and a hint of sexy, underscored by a slight muskiness that isn&#x27;t overwhelming at all.  The scent is feminine without being overly flowery, and I would highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! It has such a clean smell and not to flowery. I have received many complements when wearing it. It took no time at all to receive it! That was fantastic. It was a great price for a good size amount. I was all around pleased with this order. I absolutely give it 5 stars!!!!!</li>
    <li> My scent for years. Always get compliments.</li>
    <li> When I bought these two bottles of J Lo Glow I believe they were about $15 less (each) than what I pay in stores, which is GREAT!  Almost like 2 for 1.  The perfume smelled like Glow but for some reason the scent wasn&#x27;t as strong, &amp; did not last all day like Glow normally does for me.  In addition, the whole time I used these bottles I didn&#x27;t get the usual compliments to my scent that I always get from everyone (male &amp; female - they like the Glow plus the hair stuff I use).  Once I went back to store-bought J Lo Glow, the compliments returned.  All is normal again. :)</li>
    <li> IT SMELLS LIKE DEAD ROSES. TO ME ITS A PERFUME FOR OLDER PEOPLE. IN THERE LATE 50S MABEY. I RECOMMEND yU NOT TO BUY THIS PERFUME.</li>
    <li> The product is not the original Glow by JLo. The scent is just nothing like it. I have been using this for a long time now and I am very familiar with the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is just not the same.</li>
    <li> Smells too strong and very jasmine on me, gives me a headache. Just goes to show that one should definitely spray on their own skin first before ordering &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Bought for Christmas present, hope she likes it.</li>
    <li> Great value!!! Excellent service.</li>
    <li> good size bottle. But have not smelled it yet.</li>
    <li> Thanks to seller&lt;br /&gt;Gift arrived amazingly fast.  I was really worried the gist wasn&#x27;t going to arrive in time for Mother&#x27;s Day , but arrived in 2 days.  A++++ smells great and mom loves it.  She thinks she&#x27;s JLO LOL :)&lt;br /&gt;Happy Mother&#x27;s Day&lt;br /&gt;MoM</li>
    <li> Great price! My favorite perfume!</li>
    <li> This smells so good, I&#x27;ve been using this for the past 10 years!</li>
    <li> It arrived new and on time, how ever when  I spray the perfume on me.....Oh my God...it did not smell as good as I hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;It might be that my body chemistry and the perfume ingredients didn&#x27;t mix well or the smell clash..&lt;br /&gt;It smells good when I spray it on paper....but on me smell terrible, so I gave it to my sister.&lt;br /&gt;I hope it will go better with her body chemistry.</li>
    <li> I love the soft floral scent of this perfume. It&#x27;s been a favorite for years.</li>
    <li> PACKAGE ARRIVED IN PERFECT CONDITION.  &amp;#34;GLOW&amp;#34; IS  ONE OF MYDAUGHTER&#x27;S FAVORITE FRAGRANCES.  IT IS A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR HER.</li>
    <li> Love this in my collection... it stays on decent.... is a very nice, subtle, clean smell. Not overpowering... good when you want to smell good but not scare anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this scent!! Thank you for the fast delivery and great price!</li>
    <li> Bought as a present. Its what she wanted so its great.</li>
    <li> last night i even sprayed some on after a bedtime shower...and i was alone. :)  its so fresh and clean and sexy.  i love it.  i resisted getting it forever, because it seemed embarrassing or something, but that j.lo...she knows what she&#x27;s doing!  fashion, makeup, fragrance...she&#x27;s got it together.</li>
    <li> loved it great value for the buy</li>
    <li> Smells great!  Soft, light scent. Very refreshing.</li>
    <li> IT WAS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR MY SISTER &amp; SHE LOVES IT!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a gift for my close friend this is one of her top perfume. It is a birthday gift I got it for her last year also.</li>
    <li> not satisfied with the purchase fragrance don&#x27;t stay in your clothes</li>
    <li> Smells amazing.  Would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I surprised my wife and she loved it happy wife happy life♡♡</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister. She loves Glow. I was very happy with the price! I couldn&#x27;t believe how inexpensive it was. Also with Prime I was able to receive free shipping! One of the really best savings  I have gotten by far on Amazon! Some things that I buy; I really see no savings or a very limited one. I sometimes just shop on line for the  connivence of it. and that I do not have to go searching the malls and stores for what I want. That in itself is  a definite PLUS.  But when you get a GREAT price and the connivence of not having to do anything but click a button it makes it all the more worth the while..... THANK YOU so much to the seller!! A++ for sure!</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this fragrance! It is not overpowering, and is always sexy and understated. Like your black cashmere turtleneck and jeans, or with your little black dress; great for every occassion.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Eau De Toilette Spray.  I&#x27;m so glad I found it on AMAZON.COM because the price was more than reasonable.  Will be buying more from AMAZON.COM</li>
    <li> Wife loved it. I scored brownie points. Go me.</li>
    <li> I really love JLO Glow. It wad at a great price and received order fast and well packaged.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of Glow. I always receive compliments when I wear it. Very fresh and long lasting scent.</li>
    <li> excellent product, excellent price</li>
    <li> Too sweet for me.  Smells great in the bottle and when I first put it on, but then it kind of turned and went sweet. Not sickly sweet - certainly not as bad as some perfumes I&#x27;ve tried.  For a middle-level perfume, it&#x27;s not bad and I know that how perfumes wind up smelling has a lot to do with individual body chemistry, but this one starts as a clean, light fragrance and then gets sweeter and sweeter.</li>
    <li> I wore this years ago and coworkers would say it smells like luxe soap...Not the type of reaction I would expect. I don&#x27;t remember getting compliments as much as when I wear other scents. If its $15, its worth buying- anything more and you&#x27;re wasting your $$</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry but I was not satisfied with my product.  I usually buy this product through Sam&#x27;s Club.  This morning I opened the first bottle I bought from Amazon and it just doesn&#x27;t smell the same.  Amazon&#x27;s product smells cheap and nothing like what I&#x27;m used to. It smells more like alcohol than what it is suppose to smell like.  Just not satisfied....</li>
    <li> JLo Glow is a refreshing, light, delicate floral that&#x27;s become a frequent flier in my perfume wardrobe. It is a nice change from oriental, fruity-floral, and chypre scents, possessing the same soapy-shower-clean vibe as Lauder&#x27;s Pleasures or Lancome&#x27;s Miracle. But it is not stridently soapy or astringent in the least. The pink grapefruit and orange blossom give the right amount of sharpness in the opening, and they quickly mellow to reveal roses, lilies, and soft spring rain. I agree with those who note similarities between Glow and \\&quot;China Rain\\&quot; fragrance oils. There&#x27;s definitely a white-musk base going on here. I don&#x27;t smell the sandalwood or vanilla at all. It&#x27;s just easy to wear, whether I&#x27;m dressed up or down, and it suits my chemistry very well. One caveat, do NOT over-apply! This wears more like an EDP than an EDT-- two to three sprays is plenty, and you&#x27;ll get all-day wear. More than that, and you&#x27;ll get all-day migraines. Spray judiciously and ENJOY!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a girlie girl, but I was wanted something for when I am feeling it. This smells good, and its not over powering. Works great for my moods.</li>
    <li> I was fairly certain that my wife had accidentally doused herself with room deodorizer, but no, it was Glow by JLo.   We had to wash everything the perfume had come in contact with as it reeked of Oust or Lysol.</li>
    <li> Glow by JLo is one perfume that remains with me everytime - no matter what. It has that very light, sexy, and fresh fragrance. A must have!</li>
    <li> Just as expected great service great deal</li>
    <li> smell is really good.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t smell pretty on me.  I tried to give the bottle away.  No one liked it.</li>
    <li> This eau de toilette has the most wonderful clean fragrance.  I love it and it&#x27;s so hard to find. I&#x27;ll be back for more.  P. Felton</li>
    <li> Love it, love the fragrance!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love thia fragrance. It lifted my spirits on feb 11, 2015 we I received it via mail. This fragrance is AWESOME.</li>
    <li> Great fresh light, clean smell... lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Scent (to me) was similar to old fashioned men&#x27;s pre shave.  Almost a metallic under note. I was hoping for a more feminine, floral/powder, clean scent.  I will not reorder or recommend.</li>
    <li> this is my all-time favorite scent.  Light, feminine, not cloying, not overpowering...just lovely!</li>
    <li> Favorite perfume awesome price</li>
    <li> Happy Wife, Happy Life.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Glow. It has a soft, sexy scent. The mix of citrus, florals, vanilla and musk work perfectly together. Every time I wear it someone asks me what it is and where they can buy it. I have had strangers stop me at the Mall or grocery store to ask what I&#x27;m wearing. This is the ONLY perfume that causes that to happen. It lasts all day. I am shocked this perfume has any negative reviews. My sister suffers from migraines and it&#x27;s one of the only perfumes she can use without causing headaches. I highly recommend this perfume.</li>
    <li> Ideal for a gift.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for my sister and she loves it. its fragrance lasts long in the skin and in your clothes.</li>
    <li> My Wife Loves this stuff, What can I say? She loves me lots when it arrives</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my mom for Christmas, and she was extremely happy (and I was too). This was a great deal, especially for this large a bottle of my mom&#x27;s favorite perfume. Shipping was also extremely fast, I was told I wouldn&#x27;t get the gift until after Christmas and it arrived on Christmas Eve.</li>
    <li> this is a nice sweet clean smell, Im glad I ordered it and from here at a reasonable price also...</li>
    <li> I buy this every year for my mother for christmas. She absolutely loves this and it is very cheap on Amazon. I will continue to buy this from year for years to come</li>
    <li> This is worth the investment!  Very low keyed and aromatic after application.  It smells as the name implies-glow&#x27;s.  Kind of like a soft burning candle at christmas time.  Never overpowering or offensive.  In fact during christmas I noticed that the perfume section had a whole collection of Jennifer Lopez scents in a package of one and the only one missing was Glow.  Glow is enormously popular with the young kids and old folks as well.  Its sweet and gentle like a lamb.  Definatly a good scent to buy for any age group!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong...i LOVE JLO&#x27;s perfumes but this one is a miss! It smells like a cheap hotel soap and is overpowering. If you are looking for a great scent try her \\&quot;Live\\&quot; perfume which smells amazing. I wear it daily and gets compliments all the time.    Stay away from Glow...unless you were an exclamation fan back in the 80s.</li>
    <li> I love it. I love the scent. I love the company. Great experience.</li>
    <li> Bought J-Lo as gift for my wife.  Have bought several times before. She loves this scent.  It&#x27;s a pleasant fragance, so why not?</li>
    <li> Classy fragrance that comes at a great discount. Stuff like this is why I love amazon and its sellers who provide these much sought after products at discounted rates.</li>
    <li> The product was perfect, just as described. It came in a sealed beautiful box and a very attractive bottle.  I will buy this again when I need more and I would use this retailer again as well.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this perfume since it came out! I get more compliments on it and pray it never gets discontinued! Thanks Amazon for having it in stock!</li>
    <li> Love the smell on my wife</li>
    <li> Great price-very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> A fast , easy purchase , would recommend this comp. to all. And best prices. You can&#x27;t find this product in any store at this price , looking forward to purchasing from this one again</li>
    <li> Girls love this, ordered for Christmas gifts</li>
    <li> Bottle looks really attractive, smells awesome on my wife, and the price is great for product. would recommend the guys to buyfor your wives..</li>
    <li> My friend got this for a Christmas present and she has been dumping it on her head or something because it is OVERPOWERING.  A young woman and even an older woman smells much fresher and nicer with just a hint of perfume.  Not sprayed head to toe and stinking like a polecat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend Cabotine or even 5th Avenue (have a look at scentiments dot com).  And please ladies, do not use too much.  You cannot cover up a dirty body smell by dowsing yourself with cologne.  Have a nice refreshing shower or bath and then apply the cologne sparingly.</li>
    <li> Product is my wife&#x27;s favorite, but it took for ever to get it from the seller.</li>
    <li> This product is EXCELLENT!!! Not to mention that is a MUCH BETTER by on Amazon.com than in any retail store. I did a search online before I made the purchase on Amazon, and all I found was the product in a much smaller size for the same price or more.</li>
    <li> I love jlo glow. The price was great and I was having a hard time finding it the stores so this was perfect. Im not sure this perfume is as strong as what I normally get though. I am still happy with it.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is fresh and lasts a long time. I get people asking me what I&#x27;m wearing a lot. It&#x27;s not too expensive either.</li>
    <li> It is a soft feminine scent. I love it.  It arrived promptly and was much less expensive than a department store.  And months later I still adore it.  I&#x27;m a happy woman.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift. Very good. Smells good. Great price. 100% recommend</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted, as I have worn this perfume for some time.  It&#x27;s delightful!</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance. First time user.  Will purchage it again and again!</li>
    <li> Get lots of compliments from men when I wear this!!!</li>
    <li> Great price, quick delivery!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite perfumes is &#x60;Glow&#x27; by J.Lo. &#x60;Glow&#x27; is Jennifer Lopez&#x27;s first signature fragrance and I have been using this perfume since it was first released back in 2002. I love the scent of this fragrance so much that I still frequently use it today on a daily basis. It&#x27;s easy to find, with many different cosmetics and department stores selling it. I often purchase mine from Amazon for around $25.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a 3.4 ounce spray bottle, &#x60;Glow&#x27; is a reasonably priced perfume and comes in a fancy bottle that I just adore. It&#x27;s a unique shape with a small decorative \\&quot;J.Lo\\&quot; logo on the front made out of tiny diamonds. The perfume has a nice light golden coloring to it in the bottle and a fresh, floral, inviting scent that will keep you smelling great all day long! It&#x27;s suitable for any season and any time of the day. It lasts quite a long time too, which is convenient, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about re-applying it throughout your busy day. You can still do that though if you&#x27;re looking for a much stronger scent. I find that I only have to apply a little bit of the perfume to create a nice lingering scent that usually lasts me all day long. I really like this as I hate having to cart perfume around in my purse to keep re-applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been complimented many times on this perfume since I started wearing it, which is another reason I choose to continue using it. I think it&#x27;s a perfect choice as it&#x27;s a strong scent, yet not too overbearing like some other perfumes tend to be. Since I only use a small amount of it each day, the bottle lasts me a very long time, at least a year! Because of this, I definitely believe it&#x27;s great value for money and a must have item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perfume is also available in many different stores and chemists worldwide. You don&#x27;t have to look far to find it which is convenient, and although it was originally targeted at young women ranging from late teens to women in their early 20&#x27;s, I think this particular product is a must have for any perfume collector out there.is a must have for any perfume collector out there.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance so much. Had to have it again.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this perfume since my friend put it on me at work in 2007! OMG! It smells so good on me, and it goes really well with my Amir Argan oil body lotion!! Its light and fresh smelling, i always get compliments on how good I smell &#x3D;-) It is very hard to find now, because I think JLO is retiring this sent &#x3D;-( NOOOOOOOOOO! Please dont stop making this JLO!?!?</li>
    <li> very good and fine good price good product good presentation i recommend the product you can buy it several times excellent bran and you can be confident</li>
    <li> This fragrance is one of J Lo&#x27;s best!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I love Glow perfume. It is a lovely scent without being overwhelming, as I have been told,&amp;#34;The scent does not arrive before the person does&amp;#34;. Which make it a desirable perfume.</li>
    <li> This product smells like deodorant .</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I love the way I smell when I spray this on. I feel like I just got out of the shower. A lot of people compliments me and asks what am I wearing. When I say &amp;#34;JLo&#x27;s Glow&amp;#34;, they get confused because they assume that it is one of those &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; scents.</li>
    <li> I could believe the price of this perfume. This has been my favorite for years, and when I saw this on Amazon at such a great value I jumped on it. Thanks again Amazon for making my day!!!</li>
    <li> Very strong for an edt, but man it will last you all day!!  Such a clean smelling soapy floral.  Reminds me of a bar of dove soap.  I like wearing this to work in warmer weather.  This is definitely a classic fragrance.  Just don&#x27;t spray too much because it can be strong!!  I would repurchase this.</li>
    <li> Love it, fast arrival, great value</li>
    <li> I get so many wonderful comments when I wear Glow!  Have a truly blessed 2015!</li>
    <li> This smells very nice, it&#x27;s a great perfume. I&#x27;m glad i bought this perfume, it&#x27;s one of my favorites. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> love love love great price</li>
    <li> This smell is great for summer! If you look good and you know it, wear this! The compliments will keep Rollin in! Lol my fav jlo scent</li>
    <li> Love it, never smelled it, went by what women said in there reviews. It&#x27;s a soft scent, OK to wear to work since I&#x27;m in patients faces all day, they have even complimented that it smelled pretty. Beautiful bottle too. Great price.</li>
    <li> I had this perfume about a decade ago and remembered liking it. I was on my first ever vacation, in California. I remember coming back to the hotel room and finding the bottle used generously (no grudge against the service, I took it as a compliment that I had good taste). I&#x27;ve been looking for a new affordable scent and thought I&#x27;d start wearing this again. I have to admit that I don&#x27;t like it. It smells like bargain brand soap to me. For some reason in my memory it smelled like coconuts or sunscreen. I will say that it is a light scent, in my opinion. I don&#x27;t mind smelling like soap, but I would prefer it to be from the shower as opposed to from a bottle.</li>
    <li> My order came in a timely fashion and everything was great! I love the scent, I have been wearing it for years! It was a great deal too! I will definitely be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful that Amazon.com sells this as I can&#x27;t find it anywhere else that I&#x27;ve looked in the USA.  I love this product, but all fragrances smell differently on different people, so if you can find it as a tester, try it.  It is my favorite fragrance.</li>
    <li> Nothing like I remembered it. Did not smell the same.</li>
    <li> love it she is very good .love the smell last all day after a shower thank for it me I love great perfume this one great one.thanks</li>
    <li> Glow by JLO is 1 of the 3 perfumes I ever wear..I&#x27;ve been wearing this since it first came out on the market and will never stop using it...I get compliments on the scent every single time I wear it..Every single time..Can&#x27;t go wrong with this at all!!</li>
    <li> Because I know Jennifer Lopez is multi-talented, I gave her first fragrance, \\&quot;Glow\\&quot; a chance.  I was in no way disappointed; it smells so good!  I often receive compliments when I wear it.  The fragrance also lasts mostly all day.  I can spray the fragrance at 6 o&#x27;clock in the morning and there will still be hints of it on me at 10 o&#x27;clock at night; now that is a quality perfume!  \\&quot;Glow\\&quot; has a sweet, pleasant smell.  None of her other perfumes compare to it.  It was her first fragrance and it is still the only one I buy.  It is a bit expensive, especially in department stores, so consider purchasing it online as I do.  I save a lot of money.  For example, at Target and Macy&#x27;s, I have seen the 3.4 ounce bottle of \\&quot;Glow\\&quot; priced between $37.00 and $40.00, but I purchased mine from ebay for a little over $20.00.  Ladies, young and old, do yourselves a favor and invest in this heavenly smell!</li>
    <li> Excellent service. Love the product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this scent. I first got it over six years ago, and it is still my favorite fragrance despite the many I&#x27;ve had over the years. It is pleasant, balanced, but has a wonderful personality that matches any special occasion or mundane day. I love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mother and she loves it</li>
    <li> Always buy this product. Love the fragrance and great price. It last all day!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  Very clean smelling</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. It does NOT get stale after use. Next day, it&#x27;s just as fresh on your clothing.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my brother&#x27;s wife...by now she&#x27;s my sister so I was happy she liked it. Good price also.</li>
    <li> Smells great , got my puchase quike ☺ loved the price on item would recommend this as a gift soft scent</li>
    <li> JLo is not my cup of tea, but this product makes my sister happy and smell \\&quot;good\\&quot; according to her, so that makes me happy.</li>
    <li> After reading done reviews I was a little skeptical about what I was going to receive in the mail.  But I got exactly what I ordered this is definitely not a knock of version it&#x27;s the real thing and the price you can&#x27;t beat!  I&#x27;m going to continue ordering this perfume here.</li>
    <li> It smells great. I would like to bathe in it but that would be a little strong.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t even give it one star...totally fake...wasted my 23 bucks :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d recommend this product to any lady! I wouldn&#x27;t change anything about this order. This was a fast service. 5 stars because I love this product!</li>
    <li> This was the one my wife requested. It is a staple in her perfume lineup. Mother&#x27;s day was a success.</li>
    <li> Perfect! shipped on time. Will order again!</li>
    <li> I got it for my wife and she loves it Thank you</li>
    <li> This is my chosen fragrance. Soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Not cloying or overpowering. I have had only good compliments on it.</li>
    <li> This perfume has such a nice, pleasant scent -- not overwhelming. I constantly receive compliments from friends &amp; strangers on how nice I smell!</li>
    <li> I have used this perfume for years !! I absolutely love it and this bottle was no different from the other bottles I have bought , Great Product</li>
    <li> I get a lot of compliments when I wear this perfume.  It is addecuately priced and has a scent of fresh ocean.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the aroma of this fragrance and the cost for it was well worth it.  I will definitely continue to replenish this item.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> The first time I tried this perfume I thought that it could be a good one, the bottle is pretty and the color of the perfume simulates to have a soft and flowery scent.  But to my dissapointment it smells like dishwashing liquid. If you wanna try a JLo perfume, better try the Live Luxe, it&#x27;s has a fruity and tropical scent that lasts all day.  But Glow doesn&#x27;t have the bright &amp; sparks it should have...</li>
    <li> I have used Jennifer Lopez&#x27; Eau De Toilette Spray in the past, and enjoyed the fragrance.  When I completed the bottle, it was important to purchase another, which I did!  To me, the light fragrance is a little &#x27;woodsy&#x27;, has a hint of vanilla, and mildly &#x27;floral.&#x27;  It&#x27;s hard to describe because everyone may notice something different in the fragrance.  For me, I would not hesitate to keep it as one of my favorites!  I am a senior, and like to wear &#x27;soft&#x27; fragrances daily.</li>
    <li> I really didnt think that this perfume would have such disgusting smell.Maybe its not original from JLO s perfume?! Anyway i dont advise this product</li>
    <li> L always loved Jlo so this product is perfect.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this scent. Fresh and lightly floral, it mixes well with my Italian skin. I always get compliments!</li>
    <li> Horrible smell. I was expecting a little better because i love jlo</li>
    <li> Love, Love this ! Hopfully it will not disappear because I like it so much..... as things seem to do .</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents, and the price is right.  It is more expensive in the stores.  The scent lasts for hours!</li>
    <li> got this for like half the price I would at any department store! so excited! I totally love this perfume!</li>
    <li> I just love my perfumes and when I find one that smells good on me, I wear it a lot... this is one of those that you can wear everyday and not get tired of the smell and its not over powering</li>
    <li> Always loved the sent of this perfume.... Fresh and clean... It&#x27;s magical. Would purchase this item over and over again.</li>
    <li> I used to purchase this at the department store for twice the price and 1/2 the size.  I was so pleased when I got this since its the only perfume that smells good on me AND what I get complimented on the most.  THANK YOU for making this such a great BUY!</li>
    <li> It was a great buy, it was inexpensive and it came promptly! I love it in fact I will order another one for my mom. :)</li>
    <li> This scent is my absolute favorite.  I&#x27;ve worn it for years and always get TONS of compliments on it.  Of course every fragrance smells different on every person due to the pheromones involved, but even I love how this thing smells on me.  Occasionally you become so accustomed to the scent that you don&#x27;t even smell that you&#x27;re still wearing it.  However, another compliment will come in and remind me that I have it on.  Because it&#x27;s so cheap on here, I plan on stocking up because this is a fragrance that I want in my life forever.  Love, love, love Glow by JLo (and mainly just the original, not the spin offs)!</li>
    <li> My favorite love it, great price</li>
    <li> Such a big bottle for a great price.  So glad I got it from Amazon</li>
    <li> I love this smell. Very summery. Reminds me slightly of the old Coppertone and the beach.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a good deal or not.</li>
    <li> The smell is the same but it&#x27;s standing power is so weak that its off in a min it does not stay long in 30mins its gones</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance! Nice price too!</li>
    <li> Bought this perfume for my sister in law for Christmas. Amazon had the best price. Couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else. My sister in law was so thrilled when she opened her present! She loved it!!!</li>
    <li> someone called my attention and asked me&amp;#34; what are you wearing? I said &amp;#34; Glow from JLO, and she said &amp;#34; i love it ,it made me chasing the scent on you !</li>
    <li> I love it and it last allday . I recommended</li>
    <li> This is my ultimate all time favorite fragrance.  I am very sensitive to fragrance and have never been a girl that could use a whole bottle of fragrance without getting sick of it and switching to another one.  Glow is the exception.  It is so fresh, sexy, clean and feminine.  It has become my signature fragrance.  I love it on me and so does every body I know.  It even smelled good to me when I was pregnant!  If you love fragrances that are not overpowering and too strong you will love this one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best price I could find anywhere!!! Everyone else wanted more money for bottles that were more than half the size. This is my wifes favorite and it made a great christmas stocking stuffer!!!</li>
    <li> I just got it in the mail today.  I spritzed it on my wrists and it smells good.  I&#x27;d rather spray it into the air and walk into it.  It has a sweet smell but not sickingly sweet.  This is the first time that I&#x27;m seeing the bottle up close and it&#x27;s so pretty.  I look forward to purchasing other JLo scents.  The seller packed it securely and neatly.</li>
    <li> The product arrival was indeed on time but the item was an imitation.  The scent would be lost after half an hour of spraying onto the skin.</li>
    <li> Ended up using it as air freshener because I did not want to put it on me.  Seems cheap.</li>
    <li> Very Good&lt;br /&gt;My girl loveit</li>
    <li> Love, Love JLo Glow.  Its a white soft aromatic perfume.  Just beautiful!</li>
    <li> I just received my package of Glow by Jennifer Lopez and I gotta say I am shocked at all the great reviews, much less that Jennifer would put her name on this, I keep waiting for it to get better!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance, it&#x27;s light, fresh, and not over-powering. Kind of like the perfect fit of bed as in Goldie Locks tale, not too big or too small, just right.</li>
    <li> Great, quickly delivery!</li>
    <li> Not a great scent for me.</li>
    <li> I have always liked this fragrance, I was glad to be able to find it.</li>
    <li> This is my signature perfume. I get tons of compliments when I wear it. This is my favorite smell!</li>
    <li> my favorite perfume. It is a very large bottle too. Better than expected.</li>
    <li> I sampled this fragrance awhile back at a department store &amp; it smelled pleasant on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years later, I sampled &#x27;Glow&#x27; again.  This time upon spraying, Glow by JLo smelled pleasant like before, but soon smelled like cheap hotel soap (As we get older, our sense of smell changes, so recognize that your own sense of smell can make the perfume&#x27;s scent change over time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to enjoy this perfume, but just couldn&#x27;t.  Sorry, Ms. Lopez :/. Unless you want to smell like cheap hotel soap, skip it. next, please...</li>
    <li> Smells very cheap.  I would not order again.</li>
    <li> Nice soft scent, I think I found my new perfume!! Reasonably priced, will order again &amp; again, would love to have a purse size.</li>
    <li> I usually where this everyday, it has a fresh scent, as if you walked through a meadow of flowers. I would recommend  this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like Jlo, but I love this perfume. Smells very clean and light. People always tell me I smell like I just got out of the shower..... It&#x27;s a clean smell and is long lasting. People in elevators will appreciate you with this on!</li>
    <li> My wife recently ran out of &amp;#34;Glowing&amp;#34; perfume by Jennifer Lopez.  So I ordered what I thought was a replacement from Amazon.  Turns out I ordered &amp;#34;Glow&amp;#34; instead.  Amazon would not return this item because they classify it as &amp;#34;hazardous&amp;#34; to ship.  Funny they were able to ship it to me without a problem.  BTW, this perfume does not smell good.  It smells like it would suit an elderly woman.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is so lovely, I don&#x27;t know where it&#x27;s been all my life. It has a nice strong scent that lasts forever or until you shower or wash the garment</li>
    <li> Nice perfume fully satisfied. Also affordable.</li>
    <li> Smell good and perfect for the price.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne, good price</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for at a great price.</li>
    <li> This body spray is just awesome I really love it</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! A while ago I was at a party and I took off my jacket.  Ha! As in was going to put it on the couch this guy asked if he could hold my jacket cause he loved how it smelled, it was JLoGlow! It is a fun, scrumptious aroma that besides me, everybody loves hugging me cause I smell great!</li>
    <li> Been wearing this for  10 years. It is a light very clean scent. Always get compliments.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted to Glow since it first release and now it almost 10 years and I still use it :)</li>
    <li> I received this in record time and was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Smell is so good...this is the right fragrance for a romantic appointment...</li>
    <li> Just love the scent in this product.</li>
    <li> delivery was surprisingly fast.  Although I believe they are authentic, it has an off smell about it...like..old? I don&#x27;t know if that makes sense.  But the smell is definitely off.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne b for my self because I had heard b from a few people that it smells  really  good. I looked at the reviews and the price and decided to give  it a try. I was awesome,something I would buy again. It arrived  very fast with in 2 or 3 days and a great price.</li>
    <li> Every Ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Todo Bien!</li>
    <li> This is my second time buying this product. Nice smell.. reasonable price</li>
    <li> My wife LOVES this perfume,she always orders this online ! GREAT PRICE ! GREAT PRODUCT ! AWESOME SMELL ! DATE NIGHT EVERY FRIDAY : )</li>
    <li> My all time fav fragrance !</li>
    <li> If you like that incredibly yummy fresh fragrance on your skin as you are drying off after a bath you will adore this perfume, It somehow manages to grab that moment and let you hold on to it all day. It is fresh, clean and a little girly all in one. It is my favorite perfume in this price range. You will get compliments. It is lovely. :)</li>
    <li> Since the introduction of J Lo Glow products, like many things, has reduced in price considerably yet retains the authentic fragrance and bottle.  I received my first J Lo Glow products from J Lo herself and have continued purchasing this product every Christmas because it is the only perfume my wife wants. It has the best fragrance of any other available. This is not only because of J Lo generosity years ago, this has the best, freshest ,and distinguishable  fragrance. It&#x27;s not overpowering, nor too much of one &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; nor does it get old.  It has been about 12 years since receiving this wonderful gift from Jennifer and I still love it as much today.</li>
    <li> Great experience!  Fast delivery. And product was just as expected.</li>
    <li> Not arrival  so no have opinion the sale taked to much time for  arrival its  out of time  i&#x27;m buy 28 october and today 8 november not arrival .</li>
    <li> I love the fresh fragrance of this perfume. It is my go-to fragrance every day, for work and play !</li>
    <li> Fantastic price! Love this clean light fragrance! Been wearing this for years.</li>
    <li> This was $75 in a department store and I got it for about $25.  Great deal!  Thanks ever so much.</li>
    <li> desgradable smell like toilet soap kuy not recommend it, especially if is looking for a pleasant aroma, do not buy it because they disappoint</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my purchase! I can&#x27;t believe I was able to get this size of fragrance for the price I did! It was double in the local stores...and I received free shipping! I receive compliments each time I wear it. I am glad I shopped Amazon.</li>
    <li> Super cool perfume. i bought it as a gift.</li>
    <li> First time using this cologne and it is worth it</li>
    <li> The product was very good. It was just as I remember it to be. I was very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is a very beautiful perfume. Product came on time.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume isn&#x27;t over powering! I just love it will prob become my signature scent and I have a lot of perfume..so that says a lot! It arrived a day early!</li>
    <li> Smells soft and not over powering.  I get migraines from a lot of colognes, but this was is nice.  I would highly recommend it.  Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I did not care for this perfume. Didn&#x27;t receive any compliments and I&#x27;m sure on somebody else is fine everybody chemistry is different. Didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Really nice and loving the huge discount.</li>
    <li> I love this, on a limited income, I could not afford it and now I wear it every day and it smells great.  This is a good seller, go for it, and with a VERY timely delivery, well packed, no jingle of broken glass here</li>
    <li> My mother-in-law loves this perfume. It was hard to find, because most are over priced and are in gift sets.</li>
    <li> It smells fantastic!!!</li>
    <li> great deal. Great price. Great perfume!</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping, and the perfume smells wonderful!!! Also, great price for the size of the bottle. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite to wear and the price at Amazon as usual can&#x27;t be beat!  Love letting my fingers do the shopping</li>
    <li> My favorite scent great quality</li>
    <li> I mistakenly ordered this cologne for my adult daughter for Christmas.  I meant to order Still.  However, I kept the product because my grand-daughter likes it and gave it to her.  I reordered the Still and had two happy people.</li>
    <li> This perfume is absolutely amazing and I always get compliments when I wear this. It&#x27;s definitely one of my favorite scents (and definitely smells better than her other perfumes). My only complaint is it fades quickly. You can spray yourself 10 times before you leave you house in the morning and the scent is GONE by noon. I love fresh, feminine scents and this is definitely one of them they need to figure out a way to make it so it doesn&#x27;t fade so fast. If its on sale I buy it, if not I stick to Cartier.</li>
    <li> The perfume smells good, but does not stay with me,</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great, light scent. I wear it all the time.</li>
    <li> Super happy came fast and it&#x27;s what the wife wanted!!!</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s is a magic fragrance. It&#x27;s seems like a flower garden.&lt;br /&gt;It has a soft fragrance and a good fixer, last all day long.</li>
    <li> Is nice!  Arrived in perfect conditions.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s original brand JLO&lt;br /&gt;That´s so ok!&lt;br /&gt;the essence is sweet</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my wife, and she absolutely loves it. The price was right too.This product arrived well before advertised. It&#x27;s a refreshing, lovely smelling perfume, and not overpowering. Made for a nice gift.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Many compliments from coworkers</li>
    <li> The smell is too good.</li>
    <li> What I expected!  Thanks</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Mom and she loves it.</li>
    <li> My friends said it smells really good</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. Have used it for years dad it is not sold in stores anymore</li>
    <li> Love the perfume!  Get compliments all the time :)</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite perfume for years!</li>
    <li> Everything came as expected.  Fast.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is my signature scent. The aroma lasts all day and sometimes into the next pending on the weather outside. It&#x27;s great for any season, any occasion.  I alwaysss get compliments on it and everyone is always surprised when I tell them it&#x27;s by J.Lo.  The price for the quality ...you just can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> I have had compliments on this fragrance. I like it. It is very light, not old lady strong. My only complaint is that the spray bottle is awkward to use because of the long neck. It is difficult to apply with one hand.</li>
    <li> this perfum is my favorite! I have been using it for many years...and the price is very good too!! i recommend it!!</li>
    <li> use it all the time, everyone comments on it</li>
    <li> great value for a perfume I paid much more for at Dillards</li>
    <li> Enjoyed the fragance in the spring, recently reordered and I so enjoy it in the winter because it&#x27;s a reminder spring is on the way.</li>
    <li> I think it has a light scent to it, not overpowering. It smells classy and you dont need more than a few sprays.</li>
    <li> J.Lo Glow is the perfect perfume for work as it is not an over powering scent. It has a light and airy scent to it and smells great on just about everyone. I have worn it for years and will continue to wear it until they stop making it!</li>
    <li> I bought this looking for something I like enough to wear daily, and even though I like it I don&#x27;t want to smell it every day.</li>
    <li> I really like this product</li>
    <li> Bottle of your favorite flavor and appearance were purchased think that a good buy too.&lt;br /&gt;All you do buy them after use.</li>
    <li> The Wife loves it. Smells great on her and it&#x27;s always a gift for her on her birthday or Christmas...</li>
    <li> This is my favorite fragrance, since I first tried it, I could never leave her, I really love, is super durable and a fairly soft fragrance.</li>
    <li> Great quality, 100% recommended! I love it &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Other than actual pieces of art or a home-cooked meal, perfumes may be the most subjective thing to try to evaluate. I ordered this perfume after trying out many samples at the store. This one was one of may favorites, and the price I got from amazon was terrific, so that (literally) sold me. My wife likes it, too, and I can&#x27;t ask for more. It&#x27;s a good perfume at a good price.</li>
    <li> I live this perfume.  I got a get price for a large bottle. My husband loves this on me. I will buy this over and over again.</li>
    <li> Or atleast thats what she told me!&lt;br /&gt;She got it as a Christmas present&lt;br /&gt;Says it smells good...&lt;br /&gt;Even though I didnt like it much( But its not mine, so can&#x27;t complain)&lt;br /&gt;I asked her if it was legit... She responded &amp;#34; Why wouldnt it be?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;So I guess its the real thing&lt;br /&gt;Looks just like its pictured.&lt;br /&gt;Smells sort of like flowers?</li>
    <li> excellent service and good price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this perfume in the past and definelty needed it back, give it a few min to set on skin or clothing. Amazing smell. And fast shipping</li>
    <li> Lovely Floral Fragrance!</li>
    <li> Love the scent, it lasts long.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY!!! I have bought J Lo perfume before and this smells NOTHING like the real J Lo!  I would not even use this to scent my toilet.</li>
    <li> This perfume is now one of my favorites!  I always loved Ralph Laurne, but now JLO will also be one the perfumes I purchase</li>
    <li> I absolutely hate this perfume, it smells like cheap soap.  The color of it is a very light pink and I thought it was supposed to be a rosier pink.  I&#x27;m not sure but it just doesn&#x27;t smell at all good.  It was a complete disappointment.  I can&#x27;t even give it away as a gift because it stinks, so I&#x27;ll just have to throw it out.  Word to the wise, stay away from this one!</li>
    <li> I love this fragance, and especially the price$😉</li>
    <li> I, myself, was kind of disappointed in this scent.  After reading all the reviews I thought I had the perfect scent but actually I&#x27;m on the disappointed side of it.</li>
    <li> I bought, GLOW, as a Christmas gift for my Sister.  Eventhough it was packed badly, all seems in tact.  haven&#x27;t opened the box.  Won&#x27;t till Christmas!  She will open her gift!</li>
    <li> great price came on time</li>
    <li> Was given Glo as gift a few years ago. It&#x27;s light and subtle. Its the only thing I wear. Love that I can purchase online</li>
    <li> I meant to order Miami Glo instead of this one.  I love!!!the scent of Miami Glo.  Regular Glo gets just two stars from me.  Too Flowerey for my taste!</li>
    <li> this perfume smells of toilet soap, not like me at all, it was a gift for my daughter on her birthday, but it was disappointing to see that its smell was unpleasant</li>
    <li> Knock-off -or-Not this stuff smells great and I get asked &amp;#34;What scent are you wearing?&amp;#34; everytime I have it on. Granted, it is an Eau De Toilette Spray (light body mist), and not an Eau De Parfum; it only last a good 6-8 hours. Never-the-less its at a great price that you won&#x27;t find anywhere else for such a large amount...BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Every time I wear this someone comments on how wonderful it smells.  Apparently, I have the chemistry in my system that agrees with it.  I have friends who have worn it and it smells differently on them and they don&#x27;t like it.  Probably a hit or miss thing.</li>
    <li> Got this item in no time plus I love JLo products this is a lovely smell but just put a lil on that&#x27;s all u need and got a great price for it thanks</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite perfume,and everytime I wear it I get compliments from people everywhere I go! It just smells so fresh,and clean! It&#x27;s a very feminine,flirty fragrance!</li>
    <li> Like another reviewer said, I have to agree.  I have purchased MANY bottles of Glow over the years and know its staying power and projection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS product from THIS supplier is watered down.  The scent lasts 20 minutes, max.  Jennifer Lopez&#x27;s actual Glow perfume is WAY better and lasts all day and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get the real thing elsewhere.  It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I love the scent, it is not strong and it smells very nice. I go through Amazon&lt;br /&gt;because I get a better price for it.</li>
    <li> I really like this perfume.</li>
    <li> It really smells like a rotten badger&#x27;s taint. I don&#x27;t know why someone would want to smell so evisceral. I bought it for my mother-in-law.</li>
    <li> love it very affordable and very fast delivery</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful on the wife!</li>
    <li> Awesome &amp; the real deal.  Not a knock-off.  Fast shipping</li>
    <li> Thank you received the product in good condition</li>
    <li> excellent purchase. fast shipping</li>
    <li> I received this as a present. I love florals but this fragrance has a powdery note that I didn&#x27;t care for at all.  I didn&#x27;t think it smelled like flowers or vanilla.  My advice is to smell it for yourself before you purchase.</li>
    <li> Great product and serice.  Delivery was fast!</li>
    <li> love this scent.. item arrived on time ...no complaints</li>
    <li> Bought it for my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day. She loved it. She&#x27;s very very happy and thanked me several times. She said  it was fragrant &amp; not too strong. Just perfect.</li>
    <li> My 92-year old mother loves this cologne. It smells like a fine English soap. All my mom&#x27;s old friends love it too and give her lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> Once this dries down really fresh and clean smelling.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!!! Get compliments on it all the time!!! People actually stop me in the store to tell me how good I smell!</li>
    <li> My daughter in law loves it</li>
    <li> Like the light smell.  Great for something that is not overpowering.</li>
    <li> OMG! IVE BEEN WEARING THIS COLOGNE SINCE IT CAME OUT. I WAS DEVISTATED WHEN THEY DISCONTINUED IT. IM SOOOOO EXCITED YOU CARRY IT.</li>
    <li> I received Glow Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 Ounces today and its twice the size and half the price you would pay in department stores. I absolutely love this fragrance, it smells light and clean and lasts all day. People are always telling me how good I smell.  Thanks Amazon for your fast delivery and great products @ affordable prices. I will definitely be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Love it and the price is great!</li>
    <li> it looks so pretty and smells very familiar. I cannot tell what smell exactly.. but it smells like the one I had when I was a teenager. maybe the only thing is the fragrance fades away very quickly.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume!  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years and always get comments of how good it smells.  Very light and feminine</li>
    <li> Based on all of the reviews claiming this product was a knock-off, I was pretty worried... I even tried to cancel my order within 5 minutes of placing it (wasn&#x27;t able to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product I received was NOT a knock-off. Not sure what was up with the other reviewers products, but I&#x27;ve been wearing both Glow and Glow After Dark for about 10 years and know I got the actual perfume.</li>
    <li> I would tell people to try this one because it has a great smell to it.  And I have been using this since it came out</li>
    <li> Very nicely done, and done very nicely indeed!  I was wondering the first time my wife let me draw in this scent if this was going to be bold and brassy, or demure, sultry and seductive? However, I was engaged by a fresh scent that was warm, tender and caressing. Again, very nicely done, and done very nicely indeed!</li>
    <li> This perfume is nice but does not smell like my type of perfume...it is a clean smelling perfume but I perfer perfumes that smell more floral...if you like clean smelling perfumes that smell like soap this if for you!</li>
    <li> Nice smell(lil too sweet for me but still nice) Long last.&lt;br /&gt;My sister try it , she loves it too&lt;br /&gt;Nice one</li>
    <li> was not what I expected, I did not like at all, his soap aroma. not recommended</li>
    <li> Glow is the perfect enticing fragrance for daytime use, it gives you a feeling of being fresh and clean throughout the day. It is blend of amber, flowers, fruit with vanilla that creates a clean, alluring scent.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect perfume for a busy day at the office or an afternoon of shopping with your friends.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance does not stay on all day, that is why I gave it a 4 star rating.  But, I still highly recommended it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Product as described with fast shipping. Smells great!</li>
    <li> Its different, but I like different. It has a musky smell, but it is a attractive must. I was in a line at the store and the cashier had this on. It smelled so good I knew I had to have it.</li>
    <li> This has been one of my favorite perfumes for some time!!!!!! Not really a summer smell def more of a winter scent!!!!</li>
    <li> Fresh and romantic. Smells very rosey and clean. I love this perfume and it lasts most of the day. Very light and airy.</li>
    <li> the crowded malls every time I need a gift. Love this perfume as a gift for my mother.</li>
    <li> This smells horrible!! The perfume is way too strong. I&#x27;m so upset I wasted my money on this!</li>
    <li> Great smell, good price and quick delivery! Very satisfied</li>
    <li> No problems fast delivery would use them again</li>
    <li> Smells like Lilacs, lovely clean smell.</li>
    <li> Excellent article came at the indicated time. I am very happy with the item for a reasonable price. Really it is very satisfied and recommend your purchase. Really, the material and design left me happy.</li>
    <li> I used to wear this scent a few years ago and I received a lot of compliments on it, so either my body has changed dramatically or I got a &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; one or all of the above..&lt;br /&gt;Even if I spray it for a room deoderizer, it smells cheap and rancid.  This is the nastiest stuff ever.</li>
    <li> We thought we couldn&#x27;t find these anymore, so we were excited to find them. Arrived as pictured/described. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Excellent price for this JLo Glow perfume! I mostly get it for gift for a friend who absolutely loves it. When it&#x27;s gift time for her, I can&#x27;t go wrong purchasing this perfume from Amazon. I now love it as well!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for that light, fresh out of the shower scent, this is it.  I am complimented CONSTANTLY on how great I smell.  I have worn this for 7 years now and still love it just as much as when it was first given to me (at 15 years old!)</li>
    <li> Glow is the first &amp;#34;grown up&amp;#34; perfume I ever owned when I was about 15. When this thing launched it was a BIG DEAL and I was excited to jump on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as fragrances go, it&#x27;s definitely not going to wow you. Honestly if you&#x27;re an adult who has already tried a number of fragrances you&#x27;re probably going to want to skip it. It&#x27;s a very generic &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; smelling fragrance with some slight floral notes. However, as a first perfume for a teenager I think it&#x27;s a great choice. It&#x27;s very safe, it smells pretty good on nearly everyone and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s offensive smelling at all. It also lasts quite a while. I&#x27;m kind of a perfume nut so I&#x27;ve tried everything, and this honestly is one of the longest lasting scents I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s also very subtle and almost impossible to go overboard with, so you don&#x27;t need to worry about putting on way too much and clearing a room.</li>
    <li> I ARRIVE EVERYTHING IN PERFECT STATE, MY WIFE LIKES PERFUME A LOT, it is SCENT it is VERY RICH, it LIKES ME TO MI WHEN it USES IT BECAUSE SHE FEELS MORE FEMININE 100 RECOMMENDED%.</li>
    <li> thanks for the product all this fine see you later</li>
    <li> My favorite scent ever! Love love this feminine smell. Gonna keep buying it</li>
    <li> The best fragrance in the world.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite perfume and a very good price. Delivered on time and as advertised. Well done.</li>
    <li> This fragance has always been a favorite of mine.  I am very happy to have found it, and delivery was so quick!!</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY perfume I can wear and for the price I got it! Definitely I will buy more from this site since I only pay half of what I would normally pay :)</li>
    <li> Someone gave the small gift set when I was 13 years old in 2003. I had a much more sensitive nose then, I remember falling in love with it &amp; I found the opportunity to buy a bigger size for myself. I&#x27;ve tried many others throughout the years, &amp; I stuck with \\&quot;Sweet Honesty\\&quot; by Avon, consider it a cheap imitation of Glow. I&#x27;ve tried JLo Live Luxe &amp; all her other perfumes. But none of them will ever make me feel confident like the first Glow.</li>
    <li> My daughter-in-law had wanted Glow perfume for the past 2 Christmases.  I bought it for her this past Christmas. It was the first time I had actually smelled the perfume and I loved it, too!</li>
    <li> I received in timely manner. The outer boxed was a smidge damaged but it wasn&#x27;t a huge deal. Had it been a gift I would have been irritated.</li>
    <li> The smell isn&#x27;t for everybody, as is the case with every perfume out there. But if you love glow by J Lo this is a great price for what you get. This is an EDT not a EDP and  it still has staying power, like all day staying power.  Every single time I wear it, EVERY single time I wear it, I get compliments. It is my go to everyday signature scent, it is light, floral, and citrusy enough for daytime wear, and  still has notes of sandalwood that keeps it sexy enough for night.  I started wearing this 11 years ago when I first started dating my husband, and HE even still loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to you J Lo on a wonderful classic scent.</li>
    <li> My go to perfume, I hope they don&#x27;t stop making it.  It is light and fresh.  I get a lot of good compliments every time I wear it.</li>
    <li> great fragrance, great packaging and i would would recommend it to all wom3n.  Another great Jennifer Lopez product as are her clothes and jewelry</li>
    <li> Fast and prompt service, arrived earlier than expected product smells beautiful,  reminds me of, &amp;#34;Lily of the Valley.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Nice subtle fragrance. Good for everyday wear.</li>
    <li> Still my favorite scent.  I get so many compliments whenever I wear this, and it&#x27;s one of the few fragrances that doesn&#x27;t trigger my allergies/sneezing.</li>
    <li> Love my JLo Glow.Will order again!</li>
    <li> Every women in my family loves this perfume. They always tell me when their last bottle I baught them as a birthday gift is about to runout so I may buy them another bottle. As a man this perfume to me smells as what I believe every women should smell like on a romantic date or simply on a night out on the town. Lasts at least 6-8 hrs so its great and relatively unexpencive.</li>
    <li> I really like this 1st JLO product, my friend do as well. Its a subtle yet refreshing fragrance. I&#x27;ve used it for many years, but it&#x27;s been harder to locate so I was very glad you carry it.</li>
    <li> Big size love it, it&#x27;s what I am looking for!</li>
    <li> i would recomend it to all my friends. awesome product. love u guyz makes a great gift. keep doing ehat u are doing.</li>
    <li> Great price for the larger size bottle.  This perfume smells great, very fresh and clean; one of my favorite.  Packaged properly.</li>
    <li> Excellent fragrance. Excellent quality. Excellent price. Super fast delivery....</li>
    <li> Product received fast and is just what I wanted. Would order again.</li>
    <li> Very quick Shipment! Great Price! Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. So light and fresh. Nice for the hot months.</li>
    <li> I have worn this scent since it first came out and have always loved it. When it was on a terrific sale at Amazon, I immediately order two. I had just run out and open the perfume immediately sprayed it on and was very disappointed. I don&#x27;t know if it was stored improperly or is a fake, but it not Glow. There is a possibility that they have changed the scent at the manufactures for some reason. I am now on the hunt for a new fragrance. I called to return it and was given an immediate refund (Thanks Amazon).</li>
    <li> This is my signature scent. That \\&quot;fresh of the shower\\&quot; smell. Not too sweet or musky. Just a fresh and a soft feminine fragrance. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for 10+ years and will continue wearing it forever! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I have always liked this one!</li>
    <li> the only thing good is the apparience. i dont like the smell its horrible. total dissapoint</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, exact description, best scrnt.. Great price. I am very satisfied with this purchase. Sweet/fresh Floral scent, which lasts very long.</li>
    <li> my daughter&#x27;s favorite!!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly!  I love the fragrance, I like to wear it as a daily perfume.  It has a nice light sweet, fresh, sexy floral scent.  This fragrance covers the age group of all, young &amp; old!  The price on Amazon is GREAT!  It is usually more expensive in the department stores.</li>
    <li> very affordable. I will never buy from stores again.</li>
    <li> One of the best fragrances I have ever had. My new favorite.</li>
    <li> I had gotten a bottle of this from a guy I was going out with at the time say 12 years ago for my birthday (maybe he wanted me to smell like his old girlfriend ha ha) at any rate I&#x27;ve been hooked on it, and it IS the best fragrance for me.  If it ever goes off the market I&#x27;m screwed.  There have been other fragrances I&#x27;ve had growing up but they had gone off the market.  Oh well 😢. It is a light fragrance.  I can put it on and not have to worry about it being overpowering where people walk away.  Now people will come up to me and in the middle of the conversation says wow what are you wearing.  Enough said.  It&#x27;s alllll goood 😊</li>
    <li> a very clean, fresh-smelling scent.. It is sofly feminine without being too sweet , it is a combination of a clean and a fresh floral. appropriate for all ages,I&#x27;m  60 and enjoy it</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this fragrance for the past four years. It is light and fresh without overpowering the senses. I started out wearing it only in the summertime and received so many compliments that I began wearing it ALL the time.</li>
    <li> Stinks horribly ugh gag me</li>
    <li> I had high hopes after reading all the positive reviews, but I personally found this to be an &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; scent.  (No offense to all the seniors out there - I love you!) I did not find it to be a fresh, clean scent as others described, but rather very perfumey and powdery.  My husband was NOT a fan either :(</li>
    <li> I brought this as a gift for my friend&#x27;s birthday and she loves it.</li>
    <li> My favorite glad I found it and will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> I love it! Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend got this for me after I read the reviews. I wish he wouldn&#x27;t have. This stuff smells like old lady perfume. I was really hoping I&#x27;d love it but sadly I don&#x27;t. I usually like fresh clean scents but this is nowhere near that.</li>
    <li> Just what my wife wanted. One of her favorite perfumes.</li>
    <li> would order again you shipped fast and my sister loved it thanks</li>
    <li> My sister loved it and she has worn cool water for years!</li>
    <li> This was for the girl friend and the woman I truly love</li>
    <li> This review is from my sister. I gifted it to her but came to know this as a imitation. It is not even lasting for more than 1 hour. Do not waste money on this item.</li>
    <li> It was what my mother was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;I bought to gift her. And she really loved.&lt;br /&gt;I Strong recommend it.</li>
    <li> I rated this product as 5 star because it&#x27;s my daughter-in-law&#x27;s favorite fragrance and I wanted to please her.  She loved it.  The fragrance smells really nice and not too heavy.  She is happy with it, so - I am too!  : )</li>
    <li> DONT LIKE THE SMELL AT ALL.  MY TEENAGE DAUGHTER DIDNT LIKE IT EITHER.</li>
    <li> love my J LO It is not me with out it, and the price is super.</li>
</ol>
