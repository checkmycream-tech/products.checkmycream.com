<ol>
      <li>but I got a very good deal!</li>
      <li>excellent product, as descibed.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the best advice anyone can give you.  </li>
      <li>She loved it!  </li>
      <li>A great product.</li>
      <li>The brush feels great.</li>
      <li>Works great in the shower or over the sink.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my mid-40&#x27;s, fighting both acne and wrinkles, and my skin looks great.</li>
      <li>My skin looks AMAZING!  </li>
      <li>After buying one for myself and loving the results (truly life-changing!), I got one for my mom for mother&#x27;s day.  </li>
      <li>You have to use it to believe how good it is.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>and she is glowing more now!   </li>
      <li>It gets all makeup off and your face feels amazing after using it.  </li>
      <li>You have to build up a tolerance to it, even though the bristles don&#x27;t rotate and scrub, they are insanely effective</li>
      <li>Yes baking soda works nicely but again, it&#x27;s apples and oranges.  </li>
      <li>You have to build up a tolerance to it, even though the bristles don&#x27;t rotate and scrub, they are insanely effective</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s like saying that Designer Imposter version of Chanel No. 5 is JUST AS GOOD as the original Chanel No. 5!  </li>
      <li>Got this for a great price, used it for more then a month, my skin is better then before, and love the message feeling</li>
      <li>My replacement Clarisonic has been going strong with NO issues and I&#x27;m thankful for that all the time!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s great for keeping my skin looking healthy and fresh.  </li>
      <li>After the first week, I was still happy with it.  </li>
      <li>I broke out the first week, but my skin has been great since.</li>
      <li>but I have NEVER GOTTEN an authentic Clarisonic product anywhere at these places.</li>
      <li>Make sure you use it correctly, also.</li>
      <li>Both are safe for use on rosacea (but of course if anything causes irritation you need to stop using it)  </li>
      <li>I purchased this Clarisonic Skin system from my dermatologist and I love it.  </li>
      <li>being said, I&#x27;m glad I use this product and feel it exfoliates better than any scrub or gel you can get.  </li>
      <li>I also do a more thorough cleaning by soaking the head and the the unit&#x27;s reservoir in Cascade dish washing detergent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad she loves hers a much as I love mine.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>It did a nice job of exfoliating when it worked but with the newer items available (like the Nutra Sonic which I find almost identical in results) for a fraction of the price, I would skip buying from this company.</li>
      <li>Love this thing.</li>
      <li>My skin has never looked better.</li>
      <li>It feels great when you use it and really cleans your face.</li>
      <li>Cheaper, homemade and better for your skin &amp; wallet.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you use it correctly, also.</li>
      <li>Both are safe for use on rosacea (but of course if anything causes irritation you need to stop using it)  </li>
      <li>The instructions talk about speed and duration settings, but I haven&#x27;t been able to get mine to change from the factory settings.</li>
      <li>After use, I could feel that my skin is smooth and very clean.  </li>
      <li>Love how clean my skin feels.</li>
      <li>and it cleans up easily</li>
      <li>That said, the factory speed and duration are just fine.</li>
      <li>And the moisturizers do soak in much more quickly than before.  </li>
      <li>Not only it&#x27;s great for my skin</li>
      <li>A word of advice that I received from a sales rep.  Clean, clean, clean!</li>
      <li>Those things create a lot of skin turnover and you&#x27;ll appreciate something as effective as a Clarisonic Classic or Mia.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was SO excited to try this product.  </li>
      <li>so boo hoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that---I want you to consider how many of these things have problems in their first year.</li>
      <li>This product is definately worth the money!</li>
      <li>MY face has never felt as clean as after using the Clarisonic system.  </li>
      <li>Skin feels fresh and smooth afterwards.  </li>
      <li>I have combination skin and mild acne.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive and mature skin and purchased the Clarisonic after reading all of the great reviews.  </li>
      <li>Luckily, I returned it and had a no-hassle refund.</li>
      <li>I find that taking the head on and off each time may weaken the unit so I hold my unit up to the shower stream and run it through the head, turning the unit 180 degrees to make sure it gets rinsed out completely.</li>
      <li>would recommend one of these to anyone, but with the appropriate consideration given to your comfortable risk level in case you need to send it back and can&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Right now I&#x27;m going to stick with my Philosophy Vitamin C peel.  </li>
      <li>Smoother and clear, maybe even fewer fine lines.</li>
      <li>She has non sensitive skin and it works fine for her.</li>
      <li>would recommend one of these to anyone, but with the appropriate consideration given to your comfortable risk level in case you need to send it back and can&#x27;t.has not mattered, whether significantly cheaper than my regular places or</li>
      <li>It feels so soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>The sample bottles of the washes are a great travel size and last a long time.</li>
      <li>Sounds strange but I use this on way more than my dishwasher.  </li>
      <li>However, I also soon found that I couldn&#x27;t use this product more than several times a week, as my skin is on the dryer side and will become more sensitive and irritated through repeated use, even with a soft brush and not a heavy hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The delivery was quick and complete.</li>
      <li>so you&#x27;ll want to just gently circulate it on your face and not press.</li>
      <li>My face feels so much cleaner each time I use it.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>so you&#x27;ll want to just gently circulate it on your face and not press.</li>
      <li>I initially purchased the pink Clarisonic at Sephora, which turned out to be a good thing.</li>
      <li>At first (especially with tretinoin products or peels) it can feel harsh so you just have to take it easy, like so many things.  </li>

      <li>Overall, definitely worth purchasing!</li>
      <li>It definitely gives my face a deeper clean.  </li>
      <li>I bought the Clarisonic Classic from my Cosmetic surgeons office in 2009 for $199.</li>
      <li>Since I started using the Clarisonic Classic about  a month ago, my pores appear to have deminished in size.  </li>
      <li>I bought this clarisonic skin care system because it was highly recommended by my dermatologist.  </li>

      <li>Try doing this and then open up the head and see if there is any residual cleanser inside, so that you can know exactly what you need to do to keep it clean enough to do the weekly cleaning.</li>

      <li>My favorite thing to do with this is to put on about 3-4 pumps of a cleansing oil (I use MAC) and then just run the brush through several cycles DRY on my oiled face.</li>

      <li>I live in Alaska where I don&#x27;t get sun for close to half a year and this product makes my skin feel much more alive and gives it some color.  </li>
      <li>They do not sell replacement parts so if you want to replace it for charging issues, you have to buy a new one.</li>
      <li>The 3 samples are plenty of product to use for the first 3+ months since you only use about a pea size once a day.  </li>
      <li>The heads last a long time but when they wear out, replacement heads are available at about $25 each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have large facial pores.  </li>
      <li>I have NEVER had clear skin like this before in my life!\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving 4 stars because even with sensitive brush, it is abrasive to my skin.</li>
      <li>(I used 2 times a week), because it causes redness on my face, and I have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>This product aggravated my 13 year old daughters acne.  </li>
      <li>But they also have auto ship direct from Clarisonic.</li>
      <li>and if someone says they are, or that they are just as good, I&#x27;m sorry</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want white because it shows discoloration from dirty makeup hands and such much faster, but I counted myself lucky to be able to get a no-questions-asked replacement and didn&#x27;t gripe too much.</li>
      <li>Before Clarisonic I had a bunch of little whiteheads on my forehead and this machine took care of that quickly.  </li>
      <li>So before you spend a small fortune, perhaps research a natural way to clean &amp; refresh you skin.</li>
      <li>I also use Q-tips to clean the areas I can&#x27;t reach with a small utility toothbrush.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I purchased this Clarisonic Skin system from my dermatologist and I love it.  I use it once a day in the shower and it&#x27;s great for keeping my skin looking healthy and fresh.  I live in Alaska where I don&#x27;t get sun for close to half a year and this product makes my skin feel much more alive and gives it some color.  You can use any liquid cleanser with it - - you do not have to use the Clarisonic cleansers that come with it.  The heads last a long time but when they wear out, replacement heads are available at about $25 each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product is definately worth the money! It feels great when you use it and really cleans your face. I use a make up removing wipe before hand and this brush still finds the extra make up left over and take it off. The sample bottles of the washes are a great travel size and last a long time. This product also helped clear my cystic acne by deep cleaning. I love it!</li>
    <li> excellent product, as descibed.  My face feels so much cleaner each time I use it.  The 3 samples are plenty of product to use for the first 3+ months since you only use about a pea size once a day.  Would recommend to all. I have only used one speed and not sure if I really need any other speeds.</li>
    <li> After buying one for myself and loving the results (truly life-changing!), I got one for my mom for mother&#x27;s day.  She loved it!  She says that her skin feels smoother and tighter and she is glowing more now!   I&#x27;m glad she loves hers a much as I love mine.</li>
    <li> Got this for a great price, used it for more then a month, my skin is better then before, and love the message feeling i get everytime I use it.  I only use it at night, to help take off make up.</li>
    <li> My skin has never looked better. My husband said, \\&quot; I&#x27;m glowing, infact why do you need to wear make-up?\\&quot; I could not  help but take that as a compliment. I have large facial pores.  Since I started using the Clarisonic Classic about  a month ago, my pores appear to have deminished in size.  My skin has a smoother appearance, and I can use   less makeup(foundation).  I would recommend this product to every woman. It is money well spent.</li>
    <li> I bought the Clarisonic Classic from my Cosmetic surgeons office in 2009 for $199. I used it periodically, about 5-10 times a month for 2 years and then it went dead and wouldn&#x27;t charge. When I called Clarisonic to see about a replacement battery or part, of course it was only under a 2 yr warranty which had lapsed 2 months before. They do not sell replacement parts so if you want to replace it for charging issues, you have to buy a new one. Knowing how long the battery will last is a crap shoot. Clarisonic rep told me the unit battery should last 5 years but my particular unit was manufactured in late 2007 so it had some time sitting on a shelf (yeah a long time 2 yrs!) and that is why the battery probably died sooner. So essentially its a crap shoot whether your unit lasts 1 year or 5 years depending on use and when it was manufactured. It did a nice job of exfoliating when it worked but with the newer items available (like the Nutra Sonic which I find almost identical in results) for a fraction of the price, I would skip buying from this company.</li>
    <li> Love this thing. I broke out the first week, but my skin has been great since. I&#x27;m in my mid-40&#x27;s, fighting both acne and wrinkles, and my skin looks great. Smoother and clear, maybe even fewer fine lines. It&#x27;s a little messy to use if you want to keep your makeup on because the water drips down, but that could just be me. Works great in the shower or over the sink. The brush feels great. The instructions talk about speed and duration settings, but I haven&#x27;t been able to get mine to change from the factory settings. I&#x27;ve seen pictures of others that have extra buttons, so this pink one might not have those options. That said, the factory speed and duration are just fine. Overall, definitely worth purchasing!</li>
    <li> I waited 2 years to order this - hoping the price would reduce.  But I&#x27;m turning 40 this year and thought, what the hey?  I love it.  The delivery was quick and complete.</li>
    <li> Remember, just because some idiotic celebrity says \\&quot;I use this\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean that it works. They also use plastic surgeons, botox, personal trainers &amp; chefs. So before you spend a small fortune, perhaps research a natural way to clean &amp; refresh you skin. Cheaper, homemade and better for your skin &amp; wallet.</li>
    <li> I used to have acne problems when I was in teen, and now I have visible pores on my nose and cheeks. I&#x27;ve been using Clarisonic for 4months now. I don&#x27;t use it everyday (I used 2 times a week), because it causes redness on my face, and I have sensitive skin. After use, I could feel that my skin is smooth and very clean.  I noticed my pore size is reduced but not significantly.      I&#x27;m giving 4 stars because even with sensitive brush, it is abrasive to my skin. Otherwise, I do recommend this product to my friends and everyone else.</li>
    <li> Gave to my daughter.  Not good for my extra sensitive skin.  She likes it. She has non sensitive skin and it works fine for her.</li>
    <li> I was SO excited to try this product.  I&#x27;m a big fan of using exfoliation to try to stave off acne/patchy skin color.  But I sadly had to return it after a couple of weeks of use.    This product severely aggravated my acne.  I have combination skin and mild acne.  After the first week, I was still happy with it.  I used it in the shower with my non-abrasive Philosophy cleanser, and it seemed to be helping with my blackheads.  I used it twice a day regularly.    After a couple of weeks, I had a breakout worse than any breakout I&#x27;ve EVER had.  I couldn&#x27;t figure out why this would be.  Had my diet changed?  Had I been using any different skin cleansers?  Was I stressed?  No, no, no.  My Clarisonic had to be the culprit.  My breakout was so bad that I couldn&#x27;t bear to keep using it (in hopes that the breakout was a sign of my skin releasing its toxins, or some bull like that).  This was like a \\&quot;stay inside and consider trying Accutane\\&quot; breakout that lasted for days and didn&#x27;t seem to be going away.  SO bad.     Luckily, I returned it and had a no-hassle refund. So if you&#x27;re on the fence about it, keep in mind that you can always return it. (My skin cleared up almost immediately after I stopped using it).    Right now I&#x27;m going to stick with my Philosophy Vitamin C peel.  It&#x27;s expensive, but lasts a reaallly long time, and you don&#x27;t have to use it often to see results.  If you&#x27;re looking for a less expensive option--doesn&#x27;t Neutrogena make a product very similar to Clarisonic for like $20?</li>
    <li> My friend bought a Clarisonic last year.  When I saw her, I immediately noticed how fabulous her skin looked (not that it looked bad before!).  I finally broke down and bought one for myself.  My skin looks AMAZING!  It feels so soft and smooth.  And the moisturizers do soak in much more quickly than before.  I have recommended a Clarisonic to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> I initially purchased the pink Clarisonic at Sephora, which turned out to be a good thing. I purchased it in June 2010, and two months later the thing just stopped working. One day as I put it on the charger, all the lights started flashing and NOTHING would happen. I called Clarisonic about it, it seems the charger and internal battery just stopped communicating with each other and it had to be replaced. Because I bought it at Sephora, Clarisonic replaced this thing for me NO QUESTIONS ASKED, I did not have to even prove purchase. All they needed was the serial number on it. Unfortunately, I paid extra for the pink and they sent me a WHITE ONE. I didn&#x27;t want white because it shows discoloration from dirty makeup hands and such much faster, but I counted myself lucky to be able to get a no-questions-asked replacement and didn&#x27;t gripe too much. I still see the pink ones and twinge now and then but this was all they had........and it cleans up easily so boo hoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that---I want you to consider how many of these things have problems in their first year. Normally it&#x27;s with the battery or charger, but it does happen quite a bit. Do you want to risk being out close to $200 because you didn&#x27;t buy from an authorized seller? They do not consider Amazon, or anyone selling on Amazon (except themselves) to be an authorized seller. Ulta, Sephora, their website, Macy&#x27;s, etc. but not ebay, Amazon, or anything like that. NOT EVEN FULFILLED BY AMAZON counts. I&#x27;m not trying to scare you off, but it&#x27;s just something to consider. My replacement Clarisonic has been going strong with NO issues and I&#x27;m thankful for that all the time! Just do a little research for yourself if you consider a non-authorized seller for your Clarisonic. I wouldn&#x27;t want you to be sad and frustrated and stuck with a broken Clarisonic like many. I do want to point out though, the highest level of dissatisfaction is found amongst non-authorized seller&#x27;s products; you see very few people complaining about their machine purchased at authorized outlets. When they do complain, they always mention how Clarisonic replaced or repaired their item (within warranty period) and to me that says a lot. Where are these other units coming from, are they returns, refurbishes, ??? Just something for you to think about before you fork out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some people who say that other machines are &#x27;just the same&#x27;, &#x27;just as good&#x27; but there is no Walmart or Walgreens or Target battery-operated Olay (or other) handheld like the Clarisonic. I have spent a fortune on those things, they are NOT THE SAME and if someone says they are, or that they are just as good, I&#x27;m sorry but they just don&#x27;t know.  That&#x27;s like saying that Designer Imposter version of Chanel No. 5 is JUST AS GOOD as the original Chanel No. 5!  It isn&#x27;t, it can&#x27;t be, it won&#x27;t be, and that&#x27;s that. No foam headed thing compares to this machine, even Susan Lucci&#x27;s overpriced skin-eating monstrosity. No Olay, no Neutrogena, you name it. (It&#x27;s been so long that I can&#x27;t even remember all the AA-battery-run facial brushes I&#x27;ve wasted money on!) If you want to skimp on price, get a MIA. That&#x27;s the best advice anyone can give you.  Yes baking soda works nicely but again, it&#x27;s apples and oranges.  Do you do peels and acid treatments or use topicals to treat acne or skin issues? Those things create a lot of skin turnover and you&#x27;ll appreciate something as effective as a Clarisonic Classic or Mia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushheads can be pricey, but again another place you need to be careful. I wait until Ulta or Sephora have 20% off and get a multipack, and it&#x27;s enough to last me for a year. That discount makes them cheaper than any place online, even the Clarisonic store. But they also have auto ship direct from Clarisonic. I have tried--unsuccessfully--to purchase Clarisonc-branded replacement brushheads from Amazon and Ebay repeatedly but I have NEVER GOTTEN an authentic Clarisonic product anywhere at these places. Pricehas not mattered, whether significantly cheaper than my regular places or even more expensive, folks just keep selling fake ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are wondering what brush head to get: sensitive and deep pore are the SAME brush softness, the only difference is that the deep pore head has longer bristles to get into crevices and pores. Both are safe for use on rosacea (but of course if anything causes irritation you need to stop using it)  Make sure you use it correctly, also. You have to build up a tolerance to it, even though the bristles don&#x27;t rotate and scrub, they are insanely effective so you&#x27;ll want to just gently circulate it on your face and not press. Use plenty of cleanser or cleansing oil, even coconut oil to cushion the effect and help it dig stuff out of your face.  At first (especially with tretinoin products or peels) it can feel harsh so you just have to take it easy, like so many things.  My favorite thing to do with this is to put on about 3-4 pumps of a cleansing oil (I use MAC) and then just run the brush through several cycles DRY on my oiled face. You wouldn&#x27;t believe the amount of dead skin and buildup you get off this way, and it makes my pores just purge up gunk.  Gross, but great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend one of these to anyone, but with the appropriate consideration given to your comfortable risk level in case you need to send it back and can&#x27;t.has not mattered, whether significantly cheaper than my regular places or even more expensive, folks just keep selling fake ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are wondering what brush head to get: sensitive and deep pore are the SAME brush softness, the only difference is that the deep pore head has longer bristles to get into crevices and pores.

    <li> This product aggravated my 13 year old daughters acne.  She used the product as instructed but had a bad result.   She purchased the product as she thought she could get her money back if she was not satisfied within 30 days.  That was not true.  The company All Into Beauty was apparently not authorized to sell it and Clarisonic refused to take the return and issue a refund.  I will NEVER purchase any Clarisonic product or anything from ALL About Beauty again.  Very poor service.</li>
    <li> This is not one of those gadgets that you use one time and throw away into the drawer.  I use it every morning and night. OI have oily skin, and my pores would be blocked up.  It gets my face cleaner than it ever was before.  It gets all makeup off and your face feels amazing after using it.  I can&#x27;t picture anyone saying anything bad about this product. It is expensive buy WAYYYYY worth it.  I had to buy one for my Mom and sister as well.  They rave about this Clarsonic as well.  I was looking at my skin last night and was like \\&quot;WOW&gt;.. I have NEVER had clear skin like this before in my life!\\&quot;  I hope this helps some of you.</li>
    <li> Not only it&#x27;s great for my skin but I got a very good deal! I will definitely recommend to my friends!</li>
    <li> I bought this clarisonic skin care system because it was highly recommended by my dermatologist.  I love this product.  It definitely gives my face a deeper clean.  My skin looks and feels healthier.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love how clean my skin feels.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter last year and she is still using it.  She loves it and will probably use for a long time to come.</li>
    <li> I have used this for over a year and a half and I wouldn&#x27;t be without it anymore. I use it daily and change the heads from the acne prone one to the sensitive skin one. It continues to work like a champ. I like the warning feature that tells you the battery is running low. A word of advice that I received from a sales rep.  Clean, clean, clean! The directions tell you to dismantle the head once per week to clean it out, but you have no idea how much cleanser is underneath the head by merely rinsing it out. Over time mold may develop. The rep told me that she cleans out the head after each use which lengthens the life of the head and saves money in the long run.I find that taking the head on and off each time may weaken the unit so I hold my unit up to the shower stream and run it through the head, turning the unit 180 degrees to make sure it gets rinsed out completely. Try doing this and then open up the head and see if there is any residual cleanser inside, so that you can know exactly what you need to do to keep it clean enough to do the weekly cleaning. I also do a more thorough cleaning by soaking the head and the the unit&#x27;s reservoir in Cascade dish washing detergent. Sounds strange but I use this on way more than my dishwasher.  I also use Q-tips to clean the areas I can&#x27;t reach with a small utility toothbrush. Cascade will break down any soap residue which will build up over time, just rinse well. The manufacturer recommends that you change heads every 3 months, but I have used mine for almost a year before replacing it. The key is upkeep!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive and mature skin and purchased the Clarisonic after reading all of the great reviews.  Before Clarisonic I had a bunch of little whiteheads on my forehead and this machine took care of that quickly.  However, I also soon found that I couldn&#x27;t use this product more than several times a week, as my skin is on the dryer side and will become more sensitive and irritated through repeated use, even with a soft brush and not a heavy hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I&#x27;m glad I use this product and feel it exfoliates better than any scrub or gel you can get.  Skin feels fresh and smooth afterwards.  I always use it before putting on a mask.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> MY face has never felt as clean as after using the Clarisonic system.  You have to use it to believe how good it is.</li>
    <li> I gave my daughter the Clarisonic system for her 40th birthday.  She loves it, uses it daily, her skin sparkles.  I only wished I&#x27;d have ordered 2 so I too could have one.  A great product.</li>
