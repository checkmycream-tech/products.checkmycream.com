      <li>Love it and will order it again.</li>
      <li>I love emu products and I have already recommended it to anyone and everyone who will listen to me.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>so I take care of it at home most of the time.</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t seem any better than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve tried so many lotions and creams to try to soften them up in between treatments to remove the cracked heels</li>
      <li>I love the pump, too.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this lotion.</li>
      <li>I ended up using it on my legs, hands, arms, face, etc right after I used it on my feet since it felt so good.</li>
      <li>and I can tell you my age spots are getting lighter, my fine lines are looking better</li>
      <li>/&gt;good hydration and easy pump to useand</li>
      <li>Good, so far satisfied with product.</li>
      <li>so I was looking for something more oily like the true emu oil.</li>
      <li>It definitely makes you skin feels wonderful, but it goes on thick, but smooth out great!!!</li>
      <li>Excellent product--light but moisturizing, and one of the few creams that doesn&#x27;t ignite my contact dermatitis.</li>
      <li>So I bought this lotion and it goes on very nice, smells good, not greasy and left my feet feeling soft.</li>
      <li>I love the feel, it isn&#x27;t greasy and soaks right in immediately.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s such a good moisturizing, non-sticky</li>
      <li>but nothing ever felt good enough.</li>
      <li>A good product and probably a little better than the stuff you&#x27;d buy at the pharmacy.</li>
      <li>Has mild to no scent.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite lotion by far.</li>
      <li>, the color of my skin looks better and more pink and youthful...</li>
      <li>The emu oil cream was creamy, thick, went on smooth and had a great smell.  </li>
      <li>Smelled heavenly but really didn&#x27;t moisturizer any more then a high end drug store brand.</li>
      <li>It soaks into my skin right away.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice soft scent and is very soft on the skin.</li>
      <li>While I have no technical or scientific proof that those claims are accurate this does seem to do a nice job of making my hands feel moisturized -- possibly better than other hand and body lotions and creams I have tried.</li>
      <li>This is the best lotion for rough, dry feet that I have ever tried!!  </li>
      <li>The first ingredient on this stuff is water.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it for anyone !!</li>
      <li>so I make sure to have enough of this on hand so that I can keep my skin soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Thank you Australian Skin Cream....:)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more hygienic than the open pots.</li>
      <li>but my skin also tends to dry out very easily in the winter and summer</li>
      <li>Thanks ;-)</li>
      <li>I use Pure Emu Oil by Koru.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll certainly be buying again.</li>
      <li>This stuff is absolutely FANTASTIC!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works better than anything else on dry feet and elbows.</li>
      <li>After I shower I use this lotion after i dry off and it keeps my skin feeling good until the next day.</li>
      <li>the product did not soften my hands as much as it led me to think it would</li>
      <li>Was fast and efficient.....</li>
      <li>You are left with silky smooth skin.</li>
      <li>I bought an Amope from Amazon because I just couldn&#x27;t afford to do pedicures as much anymore</li>
      <li>REALLY MOISTURIZES THE SKIN.</li>
      <li>This is cream and my skin absolutely LOVES this stuff.</li>
      <li>According to the marketing for this product it moistures skin much better than other moisturizing products.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this lotion!!  It doesn&#x27; feel greasy, absorbs great.  There is a noticable difference in my skin.  Have already ordered another bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this cream makes my skin feel  &amp; look great  got rid of the cracks on my hands ,highly recommend</li>
    <li> I have eczema on my hands and they are always dry and cracking.  The emu oil cream is wonderful.  It doesn&#x27;t clear the eczema but it makes my hands moist without being greasy.  It soaks into my skin right away.  I will definitely be re-ordering this product.  I have just started using it on my neck and face too.</li>
    <li> The first ingredient on this stuff is water. Very expensive water. I tried to mix it with 100% Emu oil and and the stuff  was sticky and would not mix at all. sg</li>
    <li> Excellent product--light but moisturizing, and one of the few creams that doesn&#x27;t ignite my contact dermatitis. I love the pump, too. It&#x27;s more hygienic than the open pots.</li>
    <li> Why have you stopped selling this?  Loved it.  Would like to see it return with an automatic reorder for a discounted price.</li>
    <li> Smell is  nice, but moisturizing wise I find it&#x27;s just OK. My skin sucks thus up pretty quickly and my hands feel dry again so I find that I have to put it on multiple times and sometimes layer it with something else. My skin is super dry in both winter and summer. A good product and probably a little better than the stuff you&#x27;d buy at the pharmacy.</li>
    <li> Smelled heavenly but really didn&#x27;t moisturizer any more then a high end drug store brand.</li>
    <li> some how  not complete result</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion along with other Emu products to use while i had shingles. I am not sure if it helped but i can tell you this lotion makes your skin feel amazing. You are left with silky smooth skin. My girlfriend tried some and now uses it religiously and I must say that is a win for me. I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and it helps and not  too greasy. The product is well priced and I shall buy it again</li>
    <li> It definitely makes you skin feels wonderful, but it goes on thick, but smooth out great!!! But for price it goes like drinking water! For that reason, I won&#x27;t be purchasing this product again, yes I even tryed using less, but that doesn&#x27;t work either! I don&#x27;t believe its gonna last a month.</li>
    <li> Phenomenal lotion! I mix it with a few drops of jojoba oil and use it everyday! Thumbs up!!</li>
    <li> Very nice lotion. Absorbs in your skin nicely. With out oily residue left.</li>
    <li> no pain relief propert&#x27;s stick with  SuperBlue Pain Relief Cream, 12 Ounce Bottle with Pump  if you want hand cream pain with relief good......</li>
    <li> i ordered this item twice and did not receive the correct product. I got the 8 oz jar with the 17.6 oz label on it. was very disappointing. the product did not soften my hands as much as it led me to think it would</li>
    <li> This lotion is thin and may not have much emu oil. I don&#x27;t think it will give you the same benefit as using the oil.</li>
    <li> Just got my package yesterday and I&#x27;m not sure if I got a fake but it smells like Jergens lotion does anyone else smell the same</li>
    <li> good for the skin excellent creamy feel&lt;br /&gt;good hydration and easy pump to useand a great bargainfor the price great</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, my muscle soreness is kept at bay.  Thanks ;-)</li>
    <li> I would recommend this now that I see the results of using it. The price is great for the amount you receive!</li>
    <li> this lotion is amazing. it is super moisturizing to the skin and smells wonderful. it makes my legs feel like silk</li>
    <li> Good, so far satisfied with product. Used it during harsh winter and work. Working as a pharmacy tech, I tend to wash my hands a lot which inadvertently dries my hands out. Have noticed that I&#x27;m not the only one in my pharmacy who likes it. Has mild to no scent.</li>
    <li> I used the EMU blue stuff when I had shingles and it helped with the pain...which is what I thought this was. This is cream and my skin absolutely LOVES this stuff. It just drinks it up. I am 55+ and I can tell you my age spots are getting lighter, my fine lines are looking better, the color of my skin looks better and more pink and youthful...this stuff is just amazing!! I have to hide it from my sisters. Let them buy their own!!!</li>
    <li> Non greasy and soaks into skin well. Left skin feeling hydrated without a greasy film. Stayed on a long time despite multiple handwashings.</li>
    <li> Best skin care I have ever tried!! Recommend this skincare to any one that has dry skin.</li>
    <li> I found out about lotions with emu oil after reading an article on high end pedicures. I have a problem with cracked heels and I&#x27;ve tried so many lotions and creams to try to soften them up in between treatments to remove the cracked heels but nothing ever felt good enough. I bought an Amope from Amazon because I just couldn&#x27;t afford to do pedicures as much anymore so I take care of it at home most of the time. So I bought this lotion and it goes on very nice, smells good, not greasy and left my feet feeling soft. I ended up using it on my legs, hands, arms, face, etc right after I used it on my feet since it felt so good. I have somewhat sensitive skin but my skin also tends to dry out very easily in the winter and summer so I make sure to have enough of this on hand so that I can keep my skin soft and smooth. Definitely a must have for me.</li>
    <li> I have tried almost every product for my skin with no avail, but this product is amazing!  It works even better than my dermatologist creams that I have used!  I would highly recommend it.  Thank you Australian Skin Cream....:)</li>
    <li> This is a great great oil I would highly recommend it for anyone !!</li>
    <li> Really great product !!</li>
    <li> I have really dry skin so I was looking for something more oily like the true emu oil. It seems to work great when I add castor oil to it. Next time I will purchase the pure emu oil.</li>
    <li> This really works awesome.  I love the feel, it isn&#x27;t greasy and soaks right in immediately.  This works great on feet too.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! SMELLS WONDERFUL AND FEELS VERY SILKY AND CREAMY. HEALS MY SKIN FAST AFTER HARD WORK.  ONLY WISH IT CAME IN LARGER SIZE.  STARTED OUT BUYING 8OZ JAR  MOVED UP TO 17.6 OZ. RECOMMENDED TO FAMILY AND FRIENDS.</li>
    <li> I have used this before, and I was happy to find it on Amazon. I would recommended it to anyone that needs a really good hand cream.</li>
    <li> Love it and will order it again.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered when they. Was fast and efficient..... I absolutely love this lotion. I have been looking for a product like thus for years. I have used it all to no avail. But i was at my wits end I suffer from very dry skin from toe to head. I also suffer from Lichen Sclerosis I have a text book bad case. So have double  trouble. I have only had this lotion for a week and I know I dont want to go without this ever. After I shower I use this lotion after i dry off and it keeps my skin feeling good until the next day. On the bad areas for  LC I use Pure Emu Oil by Koru. You can get this on Amazon.com. Use of the two has almost cured t dry itchy skin. Love it. A Blessings.</li>
    <li> The emu oil cream was creamy, thick, went on smooth and had a great smell.  I loved the emu oil, I use it as a lotion with a great feeling.</li>
    <li> Winter kicks my skin&#x27;s arse, and this product made not even a dent in how dry my skin has been all winter. No better than your average drugstore brand lotion, and it doesn&#x27;t even have an interesting scent to make up for the lack of results. Quite disappointing.</li>
    <li> According to the marketing for this product it moistures skin much better than other moisturizing products. While I have no technical or scientific proof that those claims are accurate this does seem to do a nice job of making my hands feel moisturized -- possibly better than other hand and body lotions and creams I have tried. At this price, I think it&#x27;s a good buy and I&#x27;ll certainly be buying again.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion for rough, dry feet that I have ever tried!!  I would definitely order it again!</li>
    <li> I have only used this twice....yesterday and today and I can already see a difference....living in Colorado your skin gets really dry and this cream makes your skin smooth....</li>
    <li> I like this lotion but it doesn&#x27;t seem any better than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely FANTASTIC!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works better than anything else on dry feet and elbows.</li>
    <li> Love it. Second time buy this</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! You know when buyers make a review about a product they purchased and you know that you&#x27;ve bought the same product but had a different experience. However, this is a keeper and I will use this for the rest of my life. It has a nice soft scent and is very soft on the skin. I also used this on my daughter &amp; granddaughter ezema which they also loved and skin didnt itch after applying it.. this is a keeper!!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and have problems with skin products.  This is FANTASTIC!!!! I have NO problems and leaves my skin so soft.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it.</li>
    <li> I did not like the smell.</li>
    <li> This is really good stuff</li>
    <li> Before i purchased this item I read the reviews on it. I was thinking well it&#x27;s not really that price so I&#x27;ll giving it a chance. Well when it arrived I used it on my hands and was very impressed, now I use it all over. I have to hide this so my family won&#x27;t empty the bottle.</li>
    <li> Oh my.  This cream absorbs deep into the skin and keeps me supple all day and all night.  I love this.  I need to shop for a bigger bottle of this.  Must have it at all times.</li>
    <li> I love it! Emu oil has been the only kind of oil that agrees with my skin, including my face without the clogged up pores, and the other name brand lotions I have used in the past, felt like it was too thick on my skin. I can even use emu oil on my face without any breakouts. I love emu products and I have already recommended it to anyone and everyone who will listen to me.</li>
    <li> Like the feel of this lotion. Just realizing that it&#x27;s not a lotion but a cream! Wow!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s such a good moisturizing, non-sticky feel.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy again and again and again!</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT. REALLY MOISTURIZES THE SKIN.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion by far. It goes on creamy and the emu oil absorbs into your skin so it does not feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I put in on all over my body after a shower and only after a week my skin has improved. It&#x27;s smoother and softer plus emu oil has healing properties. I don&#x27;t want to run out of this product.</li>
