      <li>To say I&#x27;m impressed is a HUGE understatement.  </li>

      <li>Others seem to have loved it.</li>
      <li>It is light and smells great!</li>
      <li>I loved it.  </li>
      <li>I am keeping it though, as it is a good moisturizer</li>
      <li>It smells good and does not have any color.</li>

      <li>Love this lotion!</li>
      <li>I love this for my face!</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why i love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Seriously, I love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>so I bought this, I love it!</li>
      <li>:) I recommend it to anyone!</li>
      <li>my skin feels amazing with it</li>
      <li>This stuff is AMAZING.  </li>
      <li>The best part is its SO MUCH cheaper than at the tanning salon</li>
      <li>Nice moisturizing lotion for the face.</li>
      <li>it was just as nice.</li>
      <li>It is awesome highly recommend it...</li>
      <li>I use a fairly generous amount and it is absorbed by my skin immediately on application like a good moisturizer.</li>
      <li>So its great because the more you tone with Aveda Skin Firming Toning agent and then applying this cream to the face after a great facial of course the color is drawn into the deepest layers of your skin.</li>
      <li>It goes on very smooth.</li>
      <li>The pump on it makes it so nice and easy to use.</li>
      <li>The bottle is huge!</li>
      <li>BUT, this is a wonderful facial moisturizer!</li>
      <li>However it is, this diminishes the freckles and helps me be more evenly tanned than freckled.</li>
      <li>This along with the vintage gold for body are a winning combo that I will be sticking with unless something better comes along.</li>
      <li>After alot of reaserach I have found that this is the highest rated and the most rated face tanning lotion on the market.</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Even better..</li>
      <li>I love this face tanning lotion.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>- I can&#x27;t imagine tanning without this lotion now! :)</li>
      <li>Love this product for my face.</li>
      <li>What a lovely surprise for a faithful tanner.</li>
      <li>Most lotions make my face break out, but this stuff doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Look no farther this is best facial tanning lotion ever!!  </li>
      <li>Just make sure you rub it in well</li>
      <li>and I love it</li>
      <li>, the bottle&#x27;s top portion immediately popped up with the spring hanging out and everything...</li>
      <li>My L&#x27;Oreal bronzing lotion is WAAAY better for imparting a tanned look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If they would change the name and just target ppl wanting a face moisturizer I think they would have a more appropriate target audience.</li>
      <li>Legit sender and will use them again for tanning lotions :) sold by Lotions2go</li>
      <li>It is a good daily moisturizer but its main purpose is to be used to tan the face in a TANNING bed which is why some may say they aren&#x27;t impressed with the results if they are using it as a moisturizer over a tanning agent.</li>
      <li>It feels great, isn&#x27;t greasy and keeps my skin tone nice and even, a better match to my body which darkens much quicker - and soft!</li>
      <li>is completely true!</li>
      <li>And the reviews where people say it reduces brown spots on your face if you already have them are TRUE!</li>
      <li>It helps out in spots like around my eyes which are covered by the tanning goggles, and helps the front of my neck/under my chin which doesn&#x27;t tan easily.</li>
      <li>Temporarily diminishes fine lines.</li>
      <li>It is light and easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>but another to have a super brown body and a ghostly-pale face!</li>
      <li>Just gorgeous soft color and glowing skin!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference, but this is basically an aftercare lotion/extender and a tanning lotion in one.</li>
      <li>Light weight.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It goes on silky smooth.</li>
      <li>It makes my makeup go on so smoothly.</li>
      <li>Makes your skin feel primed and silky smooth with that silicone or dimethicone feeling.  </li>
      <li>It feels incredibly smooth as well.  </li>
      <li>Crystal Faces by Australian Gold is great.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t stay sticky.</li>
      <li>(light application every evening)</li>
      <li>Great product even color no streaking and can be used as a daily moisturizer</li>
      <li>Perfect for everyday.</li>
      <li>I might mix it up and try different lotions on the rest of me, but when I find a great product for my face, I have to stick with it.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product and i plan on buying more when i need it.&lt;br /&gt;great product!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this for my face! It really does help my face get tanner! Even better.. it doesn&#x27;t break my skin out. I have put regular tanning lotion on my face before and it makes my face break out. That&#x27;s why i love this stuff! Gets my face tan and I don&#x27;t get any pimples to ruin the color. :) I recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an old lotion I had that was causing mild acne breakouts.Yuck.This one works beautifully. I use a fairly generous amount and it is absorbed by my skin immediately on application like a good moisturizer. I don&#x27;t feel it sitting on my skin. Most importantly, it is not causing me to break out! My skin is soft, smooth and tanned. I might mix it up and try different lotions on the rest of me, but when I find a great product for my face, I have to stick with it. This is perfect and I don&#x27;t see myself switching. The bottle should last a very long time anyway.  ADDITION: Tanning beds tend to make freckles really pop out on my face. However it is, this diminishes the freckles and helps me be more evenly tanned than freckled.</li>
    <li> so I bought this, I love it! the smell is just normal not strong. It absorbs fast dosent leave you feeling greasy. IT DOSENT LEAVE U STREAKY!!!!!!!! The downside is when I FIRST started using it it broke me out but now my face has adjusted to it and it dosent break me out at all. I really love it though it seriously helps your face keep up with your body.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I ever used anything else. I work at a tanning salon and everyone SWEARS by this stuff. The bottle is huge and a little goes a long way so this bottle will last you forever. After the first time using in the bed, my face stayed silky for 3 days after. I use as a facial tanner in the bed and I use it twice a day as moisturizer. Silk in a bottle!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! Thank you so much!!</li>
    <li> The bottle had a hole in it but I didn&#x27;t want to send back because of the cost of shipping it back</li>
    <li> I saw this stuff at my tanning salon and debated purchasing it, but it was $75+ and I just couldn&#x27;t justify paying that much money for facial tanning lotion.  I ordered it from Amazon and I will never use any other tanning lotion on my face.  Most lotions make my face break out, but this stuff doesn&#x27;t.  Just make sure you rub it in well or you&#x27;ll have bronzer streaks the next day.</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;ve been using Luminary for the last few months; the facial Luminary, and today I tried this one for the first time.  First off I&#x27;d like to point out that one of the top ingredients in this is dimethicone, which just happens to be the highest quality silicone available to mankind at the moment.  Second, most of the other ingredients are natural moisturizers; all adding up to the perfect mixture for a tanning lotion.  To top it all off, this does NOT have the alcohol in it that Luminary facial lotion does, which can irritate the face (especially if you&#x27;re a man like me and you&#x27;ve shaved before tanning.)  Then there&#x27;s the texture of this lotion; Luminary goes a long way and has lasted me a long time for a 3.6oz bottle.  This is a 4oz bottle with a pump, so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll lose a little bit in the bottom unless I feel like cracking this bottle open, BUT!!!...this is creamy smooth; the way Sinfully Dark by Australian Gold is, except even more creamy and less greasy.  The consistency of this lotion is perfect for a facial lotion in that it spreads very easily to cover the face with even less than a dime-sized amount in my palm.  I actually have to use about 3 pea-sized drops of Luminary to cover my face, and even so the residue left on my hands is slightly annoying and in retrospect might be making me break out due to the greasiness.  That is not going to happen with this lotion; the closest thing I can compare this to is Pond&#x27;s Face Cream.  There is NO greasy residue at all.  As for the tanning potential of this lotion I can&#x27;t say yet, but judging by the ingredients this is the best I&#x27;ll get without using regular tanning lotion on my face (which tends to make me break out.)  I used this and Luminary in an Ultimate bed at my salon today, and all I can say is that I sweat the worst I&#x27;ve ever sweat, and Ultimate beds generally don&#x27;t bother me.  I would recommend this to anyone serious about tanning and willing to put the money down.  Besides, this will probably last 3 months or more, so money-wise the cost is insignificant to me.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this facial lotion! I have skin that breaks out when I look at it wrong. However, this has kept my skin acne-free and gives me great color. If you have sensitive/acne-prone skin, I would totally recommend this lotion. I&#x27;ll be stocking up - I can&#x27;t imagine tanning without this lotion now! :)</li>
    <li> Love this product. Keeps skin from getting dry and doesn&#x27;t cause any acne breakouts. Will continue to purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> So its great because the more you tone with Aveda Skin Firming Toning agent and then applying this cream to the face after a great facial of course the color is drawn into the deepest layers of your skin. Great feel. I had a bad week with my face antibiotic (acne omg!) but this works with my skin becoming soft and great for sensitive places that love to get dark. This at my salon was $56. Bought it here it was just as nice. My skin is still soft.</li>
    <li> I put this on my face every day for over a week and nothing happened - absolutely nothing!  I even left some on my palms intentionally to see, what, if anything happened.  Again, nothing...  I use self-tanning lotions all of the time, so it isn&#x27;t me!  All the good reviews sold me on it, so maybe I just got a bad batch.  I am keeping it though, as it is a good moisturizer and I don&#x27;t want to pay shipping and spend time going to UPS!</li>
    <li> This face lotion highly exceeded my expectations.  I originally bought it at the tanning salon at my gym.  I like to be tan, but don&#x27;t want the wrinkles or age spots that come along with it.  Well, not only does this product work great in the tanning bed, but I wear it as a daily moisturizer/bronzer under my make-up in the winter.  It immediately firms my face and evens out my skin tone. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, and after a few hours a natural looking tan appears on my face with no streaks. Non sticky and doesn&#x27;t turn my face orange.  Temporarily diminishes fine lines. I give it a 10.  Seriously, I love it!</li>
    <li> I thought this was a self tanner! How dumb! Just some dumb lotion!</li>
    <li> My skin usually breaks out no matter what kind of lotion I put on it. I tried everything from the most expensive to the ones you never even heard of. I bought this to use when I went to the tanning salon only, but when my face didn&#x27;t break out I was shocked because it&#x27;s so light-weight and works so well. I actually started using this as my daily moisturizer and three years later, I&#x27;m still using it happily! I&#x27;m tan AND have clear skin! I hope you have the same result with this as I did. :)</li>
    <li> I love this face tanning lotion. For the price I was really surprised at how large the bottle was too. The pump on it makes it so nice and easy to use.</li>
    <li> The product formula has changed and I&#x27;m not happy with the new product. Also when the product came, the pump was broken on BOTH bottles.</li>
    <li> Where&#x27;s my tan?  I&#x27;ve used this product for a week now (light application every evening) and I barely have even a hint of color?&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed ... Perhaps I got an expired bottle?</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  So gentle and silky.  I used for indoor tanning.  I loved it.  Makes your skin feel primed and silky smooth with that silicone or dimethicone feeling.  I definitely need more.</li>
    <li> To be honest, I can&#x27;t tell if what I received is the same as what I initially purchased at a tanning salon a year ago. The smell is the same, color is the same, and the consistency seems to be basically the same...but with the purchase I made online, I don&#x27;t know...my face just isn&#x27;t getting as tan as it did using the bottle I purchased from the store. Maybe it&#x27;s all in my head...but I must also mention that after my package arrived and I went to use the lotion for the first time, the bottle&#x27;s top portion immediately popped up with the spring hanging out and everything...so I don&#x27;t know. This could have been due to the shipping, or due to the possible fact that this lotion is not what it claims to be.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!!! And the reviews where people say it reduces brown spots on your face if you already have them are TRUE! This tans my face perfectly (not overly), gets rid of brown spots, and keeps my face looking fresh.</li>
    <li> I was suggested this product when I was at my salon the other day because my face seriously would NOT tan at all [Highest beds, every other day, still nothing]. I mean, it&#x27;s one thing to have a super brown body but another to have a super brown body and a ghostly-pale face! So I ordered this from Amazon and it feels so luxurious. It&#x27;s a little more oily than I prefer but once it soaks in it leaves your face babysoft. I use this after my daily/nightly facial cleanse, and immediately before and after tanning. It has a slight tingle when you put it on after you tan. My face only took 3 tanning sessions to darken nicely! The girl that works at my salon said it has DermaBronzers in it that will slightly darken your face even without going tanning. I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference, but this is basically an aftercare lotion/extender and a tanning lotion in one. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: The bottle is huge! You only need a little bit. I see this lasting 3 months at least.</li>
    <li> I finally found a facial tanner that works! I love the silky feel, it gives a subtle gradual glow. You can also use this everyday under your makeup as a primer/moisturizer which I often do. Other facial tanners irritate my skin or just don&#x27;t see any difference but this one gives color a glow almost. And it doesn&#x27;t have dha or bronzers so it doesn&#x27;t streak or stain at all. No weird orange color. Just gorgeous soft color and glowing skin! Won&#x27;t buy anything else and reorder from amazon every time when I&#x27;m running out. Just to compare, I always buy the sample or bottle from salon first before amazon to know for sure what the real product should be so there&#x27;s no doubt that I got the real thing from amazon! Order with confidence!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! I could not get my face to tan without using a lotion and I didn&#x27;t want to put the body tanning lotion on my face in fear of breakouts.. This lotion is great I can see a big difference. Happy to see my face getting darker!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for moisturizer/lotion for my face that also contains a bronzer.  On the upside, for a lotion with bronzer, this one has no unpleasant bronzer odor.  It doesn&#x27;t even really have any odor.  It is light and easy to apply.  I haven&#x27;t actually worn it out in the sun however because it has absolutely NO SPF.  Also, I haven&#x27;t really seen the effects of the bronzer, but also haven&#x27;t used it multiple days in a row to notice if the bronzer aspect really works.  I didn&#x27;t really buy this for the suntan lotion component, but more as a moisturizer with bronzer, but haven&#x27;t seens results yet.</li>
    <li> Love this Facial Tanning totally gives you color. I have to switch out my facial tanning lotions cause sometimes my face will get use to one and just keep burning rather than getting tan and getting color ! This is one of 3 of my facial tanning lotions I keep on rotation !</li>
    <li> Fantastic for not only adding color but softens lines and wrinkles - at the tanning salon I first purchased it at, they called it &amp;#34;Botox in a Bottle&amp;#34;.  It keeps your skin feeling soft all day.</li>
    <li> Crystal Faces by Australian Gold is great. It smells good and does not have any color. It goes on very smooth. I can actually put it on over my makeup if I have to and it leaves all my makeup in place! I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> When I read all the reviews about this face tanning lotion I decided to try it.  Had started indoor tanning a few months back and didn&#x27;t even realize that you should never use the body tanning lotion on your face.  As soon as I found out and did my research this was purchased.  To be honest it really didn&#x27;t make much of a difference the first 3-4 times that I used it.  Then suddenly it started working really well, my face and my body are now evenly tanned.  I&#x27;m completely satisfied and the bottle is so large I probably will have it and use it for a long time.</li>
    <li> Great product price and smells good</li>
    <li> Quick and easy, no problem. UPS was great to.☺</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t tan my face at all. For the price it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
    <li> I initially bought this from my tanning salon for about $60...and I was very hesitant as I am not used to using any product on my face in general. However, from day 1 not only did I notice the difference it made while I was in the tanning bed but when I started using it twice a day as my normal every day moisturizer it drastically improved my skin. Not only did it even out my skin tone and make my skin touchable soft, but for those of you with super dry skin you will notice how this product t smoothes and commits to making your skin supple and damn near perfect. I am 29 and began to get wrinkles near my eyes and forehead...but now they are completely gone! This is a staple product in my beauty collection and it is definitely worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Been tanning for many years, and now just turned 40, so it&#x27;s past due time for me to start worrying about that rubbery skin look that frequent tanners get when they&#x27;re older. This stuff is wonderful. I&#x27;ve just began using it, but the silky feel they advertise is completely true! Have also had problems with my face and legs not tanning as well as the rest of my body, which is frustrating since those are the areas I want to be tanned the most. I have noticed a distinct darker color on my face after only having used this lotion twice now. Too early to say that it will help me not look aged too soon, as I&#x27;ve just started using it, but with the silky feel, unlike any other regular indoor tanning lotions I&#x27;ve tried, I do feel very optimistic, but can make no guarantees yet.</li>
    <li> Not sure what happened here -- I read all the reviews and it seemed like the thing to buy.  I thought about returning it, but the lotion seems to have moisturizing properties, so I just kept it.  My L&#x27;Oreal bronzing lotion is WAAAY better for imparting a tanned look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I won&#x27;t buy it again, I&#x27;m thinking that I might have gotten a bad bottle from a bad lot.  Others seem to have loved it.</li>
    <li> It is Ok, Was not what I thought it was going to do!!</li>
    <li> The fact that it claims to be a bronzer is false advertisement in my opinion. Ive been using this product for a year and never has it ever bronzed my skin. BUT, this is a wonderful facial moisturizer! If they would change the name and just target ppl wanting a face moisturizer I think they would have a more appropriate target audience. I stopped tanning bc I dont want to look old when i get older but i will continue to buy this nice little surprise.</li>
    <li> This lotion works and smells really good! The best part is its SO MUCH cheaper than at the tanning salon</li>
    <li> Great product even color no streaking and can be used as a daily moisturizer just remember to add some sun screen amazon price 60% less than retail</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t stay sticky. Nice moisturizing lotion for the face.</li>
    <li> As everyone else has said, I did not break out with this product: a major plus.  Also, my face, after TWO uses only, is already MUCH tanner.  It feels incredibly smooth as well.  To say I&#x27;m impressed is a HUGE understatement.  If i could afford bathe in this product, I would.</li>
    <li> agreat face tanning lotion for those who want some gentle and dont want to break out on their swkin!!! does the job perfectly</li>
    <li> Look no farther this is best facial tanning lotion ever!!  Please don&#x27;t ever quit making this product!!  Not greasy, no odor, &amp; my skin feels amazing with it on&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> When received bottle was busted,leaked out I would appreciate a replacement,if not I will not be order product from amazon,will order from original distributer, I have contacted&lt;br /&gt; About this as soon as was delivered,open package no response,don&#x27;t know how&lt;br /&gt;good or bad lotion is cause didn&#x27;t get to use it,also a one day order for 3:99</li>
    <li> This is a must have for hard to tan faces!! Love it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this along with a Australian gold body lotion(from someone else on here) that was not successful. This one was completely sealed completely real and leaves my face beautifully tanned. The cherry on top was sample lotion packages I discovered upon opening my package that are great too. What a lovely surprise for a faithful tanner. Legit sender and will use them again for tanning lotions :) sold by Lotions2go</li>
    <li> I put this cream on over the past week sometimes multiple times throughout the day and NOTHING has changed. I would not waste your time or money on this. I was sucked in by the good reviews, but will go back to using Estee Lauders version that actually worked.</li>
    <li> It is awesome highly recommend it... Great for my face and neck !!!</li>
    <li> It could have a little bit of a better smell but this lotion is amazing. It leaves my skin so soft and hydrated after tanning also you only need one pump per tanning session. I defiantly recommend this for your face.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING.  I have the most sensitive skin on the planet, anything and everything will make me break out or get a rash.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a month and haven&#x27;t had a single issue with it, all the reviews I read said the same positive stuff even with acne prone skin.  It&#x27;s helped my face get a nice healthy tan in the last month, not at all orange-y or streaky.</li>
    <li> The lotion I received is not the same crystal faces lotion that I use. Not sure what is up. Does not even smell the same.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion for use in the tanning bed. However, I have begun using it every day under my makeup. I love it. It makes my makeup go on so smoothly. Even if I never lay in another tanning bed, I would continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Love this. It is for tanning in a bed! For the people who think it&#x27;s a self tanner... It&#x27;s not. It is for use in a tanning bed. I have sensitive skin-did not make me break out.</li>
    <li> this product is expired, every single one of them. lotion has a shelf life of a year and THATS IT! this lotion is well over a year old. you wouldnt eat expired food would you? no so why would you put expired lotion on your face?</li>
    <li> After alot of reaserach I have found that this is the highest rated and the most rated face tanning lotion on the market. I found this info through industry and consumer reviews in tanning forums. After using it I can attest that it is excellent. No odor, no residue, no dyes or dha, and produces excellent color. This along with the vintage gold for body are a winning combo that I will be sticking with unless something better comes along. BTW australian gold is the manufacturer of Designer Skin, and they&#x27;ve been around longer than any other so I have confidence in their products.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but like other reviewers, I don&#x27;t really notice any changes. But, I&#x27;m a big tanner and I needed a daily moisturizer, and I like the way it feels and smells.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen a big difference the past few weeks I&#x27;ve used this but I&#x27;ve always had a hard time tanning my face so I don&#x27;t totally blame the lotion.</li>
    <li> Great Product  great seller, arrived as promised in the 2 days per Prime!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Only tan lotion meant for faces, that doesn&#x27;t leave mine a hot mess. Radical results.. awesome on pocket book. Thank you!</li>
    <li> i chose 5 stars because thats what it deserves. This product is actually made by Clinque, knowing this is a trusted company and brand i chose to purchase it. It has a light scent, not very strong, but strong enough to smell. it does not leave the gross after smell of tanning. The appearance is white, not very thick or thin. its the perfect consistency for a lotion. It actually replenishes the minerals lost in your facial skin. I would highly recommend this product and i plan on buying more when i need it.&lt;br /&gt;great product!</li>
    <li> made my face breakout</li>
    <li> Smoothest lotion I have ever used. Perfect for everyday. Can&#x27;t say that it helped my face tan but the overall fell from it is awesome!</li>
    <li> Greatest product ever. Super soft skin almost immediately after first use.  I buy this at least once a month.</li>
    <li> I used a sample of this at the tanning salon and fell in love with it the creamy texture on your face and nourishment to your skin is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Non greasy. Light weight. Perfect.</li>
    <li> if your tanning,you need to use a face lotion and this is the only one i would ever recommend, ive tried other ones and they are crap, this one is super silky and $66 right now, so great price. and ships fast!</li>
    <li> I worked at a tanning salon for a long while and this is the best facial tanning lotion on the market in my opinion. It is light and smells great! I have used this lotion in the tanning bed since day one and have no desire to try anything else. It is a good daily moisturizer but its main purpose is to be used to tan the face in a TANNING bed which is why some may say they aren&#x27;t impressed with the results if they are using it as a moisturizer over a tanning agent. Your face is the hardest part of the body to tan and this product is worth every penny...even though you will pay double this price at the salon. I definitely recommend it to anyone wanting a natural looking tan on their face!</li>
    <li> Smells great, lasts all day, helps tan my face at a faster pace than without lotion.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! Ordering my second bottle now - the generous size has lasted months, and I use it as my daily moisturizer even aside from tanning. It feels great, isn&#x27;t greasy and keeps my skin tone nice and even, a better match to my body which darkens much quicker - and soft! It helps out in spots like around my eyes which are covered by the tanning goggles, and helps the front of my neck/under my chin which doesn&#x27;t tan easily. I haven&#x27;t noticed any real scent to it, and would personally classify it as unscented. Also - non streaking! It doesn&#x27;t cause any streaks on my face or hands. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love this product for my face. It is great for tanning and also to use just as a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on silky smooth.</li>
    <li> Went to tanni g salon and there is a fact of when you tan and you are older you must protect your face and neck with a good product.  This is the best I found over the years but I was paying from 45 to 60 each time.  And then I was told to look on Amazon and I found it at a 1/4 of the price and I love it&lt;br /&gt;Rate it a 10 for women over 40</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;ve changed the formulation of the product but it smells a lot different than it used to. I suppose it works though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read some of the other reviews and apparently some of you were pleased with this tanner...I can only guess that I received a bogus product. The bottle looks identical but there is absolutley zero tanning ingredients. I used it 4 times and zero tan...I left it on my hands without washing just to see and not even a tiny stain. The only thing I can come up with is that the selller replaced the tanning lotion with some sort of cream....NEVER BUY THIS KIND OF STUFF FROM AMAZON AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
