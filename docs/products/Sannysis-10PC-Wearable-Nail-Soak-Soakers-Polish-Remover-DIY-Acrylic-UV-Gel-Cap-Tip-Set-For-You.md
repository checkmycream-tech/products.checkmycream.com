      <li>It keeps you more mobile than keeping your hand in a bowl.</li>
      <li>I am glad they were inexpensive.</li>
      <li>Foil method just works better.  </li>
      <li>but if the size for the thumbs letter bigger is perfect.</li>
      <li>Many people are complaining about the tops dissolving from the nail polish.</li>

      <li>Ok product needs some refining</li>
      <li>my custermers love it</li>
      <li>this is a pretty good product.</li>
      <li>Great idea only was able to use use once seeing the rubber tore apart very easily....</li>
      <li>this product is great to soak off the old gel nails with the Acetone.</li>
      <li>Likes this product it works really good and removes polish fast</li>
      <li>I was all excited to get these, but when I tried to use them, the seal at the top seemed to break,along with one of the nail soakers itself.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
      <li>The fingers ones worked fine.</li>
      <li>They suck they don&#x27;t fit your fingers</li>
      <li>Cute and smart product, really works and customers love it!</li>
      <li>Most of them broke on first use.</li>
      <li>And you need to make sure you remove them every so often or flex your fingers they are pretty dang</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with the purchase because it functions as well as expected.</li>
      <li>They worked great the first time, but the second time I noticed that the rubber pieces were tearing.</li>
      <li>They leaked acetone when I tried to use them and one ripped and fell apart the very first time I used them.</li>
      <li>Nice, especially for glitter and acrylic.</li>
      <li>just right</li>
      <li>Tried one of the soaker, it cracked right away.</li>
      <li>The part where the fingers enter broke during the first use resulting in acetone dripping out.</li>
      <li>It is an okay product, but not really necessary.</li>
      <li>I threw them away after the first trial.</li>
      <li>The first time I used them, they disintegrated.</li>
      <li>As I use them the first time one just came apart just couldn&#x27;t understand it</li>
      <li>and it works fast!</li>
      <li>I love these soakers, use them when I do Gel nail to soak off the old the put on the new.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like that my entire tip of my finger is exposed to the nail polish remover since it dries out the skin, but it is nice to have all 10 fingers able to soak without a mess.</li>
      <li>but then again I did not pay much for them</li>
      <li>it really saves time and make my work easier.</li>
      <li>but you can real attach the rubberized part.</li>
      <li>It is much easier to wrap in foil like at the saloon.</li>
      <li>The product IDEA is good, but the actual items serve no purpose other than frustration.</li>
      <li>They are super handy for getting tough nail polish off, I used it to soak to get shallac off</li>
      <li>Two of the rubber pieces completely fell apart when I put finger in it the first time.</li>
      <li>very good delivery time, but the product requires a lot of remover to be used on each finger, so quite expensive in the long run.</li>
      <li>Even though it was cheap it wasn&#x27;t useful, it was a waste of my money, and shipping took too long.</li>
      <li>Pink is not acetone proof, melted away on first use.</li>
      <li>If they are filled to cover your nail completely you waste lot of fingernail polish remover and you cannot pour it back into the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>First time I used them, the remover tore up the pink plastic part of the suction</li>
      <li>First two I put on just fell apart - pink soft plastic just split and fell into multiple pieces.  </li>
      <li>Either these are made for smaller fingers or they were just old.  </li>
      <li>worked better, but not great.</li>
      <li>Half of these broke the first time I used them.</li>
      <li>fell apart of the first use waste of money</li>
      <li>you either have to fill them with nail polish remover, which uses a LOT and soaks your whole fingertip (and have to hold them down so they don&#x27;t leak), Or what I did was stuff cotton balls soaked in polish remover inside...</li>
      <li>First off I ripped the rubber part because I was having trouble putting it back on when I put the acetone in the plastic cup.</li>
      <li>This product was good but bad for thumbs.</li>

<li> First off I ripped the rubber part because I was having trouble putting it back on when I put the acetone in the plastic cup.</li>
<li> This product was good but bad for thumbs.</li>
<li> My first set lasted me a few months, the second one won&#x27;t make it that long.</li>
<li> , they can vacuum seal to your fingers in you don&#x27;t slide them in while keeping a tiny gap</li>
<li> The foil wraps might end up costing a little more, but are less frustrating by far.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s difficult to keep the nail submerged in liquid at all times and this leads to more spills no matter how carefully handled.</li>
<li> The pink plastic starting falling apart and disolving the moment</li>
<li> These are a complete waste of money.  </li>
<li> These work as they should, but unfortunately the pink rubber parts split relatively easily.</li>
<li> It might be some combination of my slightly wider-than-average fingers and the acetone working at the rubber from inside, but I&#x27;m now on my second set and won&#x27;t be returning for a third.</li>
<li> They do what they are supposed to do, but since they are all one size, and since your thumb is a little larger than the rest, the pink part rips if your fingers are any larger than what is in the picture.</li>
<li> They are tight on larger hands and still leak&lt;br /</li>
<li> one star, it was a neat idea, however, not very practical at all.</li>
<li> This happened on a few of them and I ordered three sets, so not a big deal.</li>
<li> Received them and everything was what I expected.</li>
<li> Look like the pink plastic are brittle.</li>
<li> After I put nail polish remover in it, the pink part started melting.</li>
<li> I tossed the rest in the trash - not worth it.</li>
<li> not useful.</li>
<li> and we found other ways to remove the gel polishes with less mess and aggravation.</li>
<li> They can be loose on small hands</li>
<li> What a mess.</li>
<li> And these are still way too tight.  </li>
<li> These are sooo tight on the fingers.</li>
<li> Buy the little manicure trays &amp; save your money.</li>
<li> not worth getting!</li>
<li> Because of the little seals coming off, they leaked all over the place</li>
<li> This was a waste of money for me.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>

    <li> Shipped on time love the product</li>
    <li> I love these soakers, use them when I do Gel nail to soak off the old the put on the new.</li>
    <li> Two of the rubber pieces completely fell apart when I put finger in it the first time.</li>
    <li> These work as they should, but unfortunately the pink rubber parts split relatively easily. It might be some combination of my slightly wider-than-average fingers and the acetone working at the rubber from inside, but I&#x27;m now on my second set and won&#x27;t be returning for a third. My first set lasted me a few months, the second one won&#x27;t make it that long. The foil wraps might end up costing a little more, but are less frustrating by far.</li>
    <li> The rim that holds them on your finger disintegrated immediately. This happened on a few of them and I ordered three sets, so not a big deal. I expect this will happen with all of them eventually, but for the price I&#x27;m not stressed out about it.</li>
    <li> Bad overall concept.  Foil method just works better.  It&#x27;s difficult to keep the nail submerged in liquid at all times and this leads to more spills no matter how carefully handled.</li>
    <li> Worst product ever. Pink is not acetone proof, melted away on first use.</li>
    <li> very good delivery time, but the product requires a lot of remover to be used on each finger, so quite expensive in the long run.</li>
    <li> The part where the fingers enter broke during the first use resulting in acetone dripping out. Terrible product</li>
    <li> Received them and everything was what I expected.</li>
    <li> I took a chance after reading the reviews. I shouldn&#x27;t have. Half of these broke the first time I used them. Buy the little manicure trays &amp; save your money.</li>
    <li> These fall apart after using once or twice.</li>
    <li> Like this product. I get a lot of use from these nail soak soakers before the rubber starts to tear.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:13861f68d4451349789cf0ef6542c48a]] Very poor performance when compared to other polish removing techniques! Out of 5 different techniques the family tested this was the worst performer and got the lowest score. These have not been a good product. Some of the issues are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* They leak fingernail polish&lt;br /&gt;* They can be loose on small hands&lt;br /&gt;* They are tight on larger hands and still leak&lt;br /&gt;* If you overfill the reservoir then you spill nail polish even worse&lt;br /&gt;* If you under fill the reservoir then they will not work well&lt;br /&gt;* Many people are complaining about the tops dissolving from the nail polish. Since we stopped using them this did not happen as they are no longer in use.&lt;br /&gt;* If they are filled to cover your nail completely you waste lot of fingernail polish remover and you cannot pour it back into the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall they just did not work well and we found other ways to remove the gel polishes with less mess and aggravation.</li>
    <li> They do what they are supposed to do, but since they are all one size, and since your thumb is a little larger than the rest, the pink part rips if your fingers are any larger than what is in the picture.</li>
    <li> used them the 1st time they worked perfect but fell apart after but then again I did not pay much for them</li>
    <li> Cute and smart product, really works and customers love it! it really saves time and make my work easier. I totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product was good but bad for thumbs. The acetone leaked out onto my wood floor from the broken cracks of pink of the product</li>
    <li> Either these are made for smaller fingers or they were just old.  First two I put on just fell apart - pink soft plastic just split and fell into multiple pieces.  I tossed the rest in the trash - not worth it.</li>
    <li> They were not good. All of them leaked, and one of them had a burn hole in it? Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> Though the product may spill if you don&#x27;t sit still until the remover has time to work.  Easier than wrapping nails with cotton and tin foil.</li>
    <li> This order took a month to get to me then the 1st time I used them the rubber part fell apart. 6 of 10 are not usable now and I only used them 1 time :(</li>
    <li> One of the soakers has a hole in it.  Sometimes old school is the best lol.  It is an okay product, but not really necessary.</li>
    <li> one star, it was a neat idea, however, not very practical at all.</li>
    <li> The quality of this product is poor. The polish remover destroyed the lids.</li>
    <li> They leaked acetone when I tried to use them and one ripped and fell apart the very first time I used them.</li>
    <li> Cheap and very effective in removing my gel off my nails.</li>
    <li> My wife said they ripped when trying to put on her thumbs. The fingers ones worked fine.</li>
    <li> Does what its made for</li>
    <li> The pink plastic starting falling apart and disolving the moment I adddd the finger nail polish remover! What a mess. The only saving greace is that the couple I could salvage, drew smiley faces on the kids fingers and they have astronot finger puppets.</li>
    <li> My gel polish never did come off using these and they hurt my fingers where they were insterted. It also used a lot more acetone! I went back and used my aluminum foil!</li>
    <li> Awful! The first time I used them, they disintegrated.</li>
    <li> Good but if the size for the thumbs letter bigger is perfect. Too tie</li>
    <li> As I use them the first time one just came apart just couldn&#x27;t understand it</li>
    <li> They broke when I took them of my fingers and they also leaked.</li>
    <li> As promised. Nice, especially for glitter and acrylic. It keeps you more mobile than keeping your hand in a bowl. Nice, would purchase again.</li>
    <li> These soakers are flimsy, ill-sized, and leaky. Most of them broke on first use. The product IDEA is good, but the actual items serve no purpose other than frustration.</li>
    <li> Ok product needs some refining</li>
    <li> These were terrible they pinched my fingers very tight yet still leaked. I threw them away after the first trial.</li>
    <li> These are sooo tight on the fingers. I wear a size 4 1/2 ring, which means I have small fingers.  And these are still way too tight.  They cut off circulation.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY!! After I put nail polish remover in it, the pink part started melting. Even though it was cheap it wasn&#x27;t useful, it was a waste of my money, and shipping took too long.</li>
    <li> This was a waste of money for me. The acetone ran out, the shakers were not sturdy and ripped.... It&#x27;s a waste of acetone to use these! Good idea, maybe; not well implemented.</li>
    <li> They are super handy for getting tough nail polish off, I used it to soak to get shallac off and it worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They take a bit of playing with to get it just right cause they are one size fits all, they can vacuum seal to your fingers in you don&#x27;t slide them in while keeping a tiny gap there will be a bit of pressure and once I had the liquid try to come out but you can real attach the rubberized part. And you need to make sure you remove them every so often or flex your fingers they are pretty dang tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they have a great seal, no leaking, come as pictured. And hold up to acetone so they are strong!</li>
    <li> Not practical at all. Incredibly tight on all fingers, not a good buy at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> These are a complete waste of money.  You can use them for one hand (maybe) before they will begin to tear and leak.  I am glad they were inexpensive.</li>
    <li> this is a pretty good product. It&#x27;s so easy to use and it&#x27;s great for getting rid of glitter polishes and it works fast! It does have its kinks though. First off I ripped the rubber part because I was having trouble putting it back on when I put the acetone in the plastic cup. But I find it easier just to pour the acetone in the opening on the top. Second it leaks, but that&#x27;s not a problem if you just put napkins under your hand. Besides that, it&#x27;s a great product, and it&#x27;s easier than using the foil method. Plus it fits most finger sizes!</li>
    <li> Great idea only was able to use use once seeing the rubber tore apart very easily.... not worth getting! Back to tin foil and cotton</li>
    <li> First time I used them, the remover tore up the pink plastic part of the suction so now I use them as dipping cups.</li>
    <li> They worked great the first time, but the second time I noticed that the rubber pieces were tearing. By time I tried to use them a third time, they were completely useless.</li>
    <li> They leak and cut circulation off on some fingers and I do not have big fingers</li>
    <li> The rubber comes off the seals very easy. It is much easier to wrap in foil like at the saloon. You don&#x27;t have to worry about the wasted remover or it spilling like you do with these.</li>
    <li> Very handy with gel nails</li>
    <li> If you do your own gel nails this product is great to soak off the old gel nails with the Acetone.</li>
    <li> Likes this product it works really good and removes polish fast</li>
    <li> these fell apart when i tried to use them. when i put my nails in, the plastic split.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the purchase because it functions as well as expected. I don&#x27;t like that my entire tip of my finger is exposed to the nail polish remover since it dries out the skin, but it is nice to have all 10 fingers able to soak without a mess.</li>
    <li> not useful. you either have to fill them with nail polish remover, which uses a LOT and soaks your whole fingertip (and have to hold them down so they don&#x27;t leak), Or what I did was stuff cotton balls soaked in polish remover inside... worked better, but not great. stick with foil.</li>
    <li> Even though it took forever to receive, once they came in, they were so easy to use and work great. Would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> my custermers love it</li>
    <li> They suck they don&#x27;t fit your fingers</li>
    <li> Tried one of the soaker, it cracked right away. Look like the pink plastic are brittle.</li>
    <li> fell apart of the first use waste of money</li>
    <li> They leak all over the place.</li>
    <li> HAVENT USED THEM YET, BUT PLEASED WITH SHIPPING SPEED</li>
    <li> I was all excited to get these, but when I tried to use them, the seal at the top seemed to break,along with one of the nail soakers itself.  Because of the little seals coming off, they leaked all over the place and I got acetone all over myself.  If you could correct this imperfection, I would be happy to try them again.</li>
    <li> Only came with one and description said 10....what a waste!!!!</li>
