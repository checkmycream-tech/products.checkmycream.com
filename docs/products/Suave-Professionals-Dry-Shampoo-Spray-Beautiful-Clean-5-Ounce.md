<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have tried many dry shampoos, and this one by far is the best. The cheap price brought me in, but I&#x27;ve found it much better than the more expensive ones(ie- bumble and bumble). I have very long thick dark brown hair- and it does leave a bit of a white residue but it brushes out. I spray this at the roots, let it sit for 10 minutes or so, then brush it in. Lasts up to 2 days. Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> This was first time trying a dry shampoo with the price being the sole reason why I purchased it. It has a light citrus scent, it&#x27;s lightweight, and most importantly it works. When I don&#x27;t have time or I&#x27;m perhaps too lazy to wash my hair, this product acts as a crutch for a few days. However, it dries my hair out and gives it a course texture, forcing me to moisturize my hair immediately. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m willing to accept that tradeoff for too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to use product:&lt;br /&gt;Be advised that like any other dry shampoo, it will leave a white film. Unlike other dry shampoos, I&#x27;ve been told, the film doesn&#x27;t take long to go away. After positioning the shampoo at least 8 inches from hair and spraying liberally, brush, moisturize and style as usual. Be sure to leave a good distance between the spray and your hair.</li>
    <li> I use this to dull the shine on my synthetic wigs. Does a great job. The smell is nice also</li>
    <li> After being disappointed in a few different brands of $20 dry shampoo I tried this on a whim.  It was so inexpensive, why not?  It worked far better than anything else I have tried.  I have baby fine hair that shows the slightest oil instantly.  It often looks unwashed if I apply too much styling product or serum.  Enter the Suave dry shampoo.  A couple spritzes at the roots and I suddenly have volume at the crown.  I&#x27;ve noticed that if I use this product on the day I wash my hair it works even better than any volumizer I have ever used and I may not have to wash it again as soon.  My hair is dark and I haven&#x27;t noticed the greying effect of the powder, but it does give my hair a sort of matte look.  This isn&#x27;t an everyday product for me though because the ingredients are frankly, scary, and I prefer to keep things simple and natural most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would change about this product is the overwhelming and chemically smell.  Other people say it smells fruity, but to me it just smells horrid.  Luckily, the smell dissipates quickly enough.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t do much to remove that greasy feeling from my hair, and as other users mentioned, this turned my hair grey. I was able to comb it through my hair enough to make it not as noticeable, but every time I touched my hair, my fingers were coated in white powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product might work if you are blonde and can spray in enough to make a difference, but with the white powder residue getting everywhere, I think I&#x27;d rather just wash my hair.</li>
    <li> I have used Rene Furterer dry shampoo in the past, but since Sephora stopped carrying it, I was shopping around for the next best thing.  After trying many different dry shampoos, I found this one to be wonderful.  Yes, it is white powder (that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars), but so is Furterer.  The point is, it does its job....it soaks-up oils from the hair, gives you volume, AND It has a good smell so it won&#x27;t make you run away from yourself when you put it on.  :-)  I found a great deal at Target (2 for $5).  I think I was paying $24/bottle for Furterer at Sephora.</li>
    <li> I wish this worked for me, I read and watched so many review praising this item but I can&#x27;t do the same. This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used a dry shampoo so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but it doesn&#x27;t seem work on my straight fine hair. I follow the directions and it just makes my hair look greasier and feel like there is product in my hair, which isn&#x27;t what I was expecting. It doesn&#x27;t look any different either. The only good thing I can say about this product is that it smells really good.</li>
    <li> The only good thing I can say about this product is that it did take away the \\&quot;oily\\&quot; look from my hair.   Now I know other reviewers have said something like this but I&#x27;ll say it again, if you&#x27;re lucky you will get maybe 4 uses out of this product. I tried this twice, the first time I got only 2 uses out of it &amp; I didn&#x27;t even spray that much on my hair both times. I thought I was losing my mind after going to use it only 2 days later &amp; it felt like nothing was left in the container. Tried it a second time thinking the first bottle was just faulty or something but nope, happened again. Only got 3 uses out of it. And not only does it have a very strong scent but it leaves my hair feeling heavy &amp; course, like I have a bunch of product in it when I don&#x27;t. Yeah, it&#x27;s less than $3.00 but you definitely get what you pay for.  So anyway, I ended up trying Tresemme&#x27;s Fresh Start dry shampoo the next time, which is only a dollar or so more than Suave, and it works great. Smells good &amp; does the job it&#x27;s supposed to.   So in conclusion if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap dry shampoo that works, I&#x27;d say skip this one &amp; try Tresemme Fresh Start! Hope this review helps!</li>
    <li> This worked great, but when I went to use it a second time the product was all gone.  My hair isn&#x27;t that long (chin length) and I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d over used it, but it was completely empty.  So, product worked well - even gave my hair extra body - but wasn&#x27;t worth the price for just 1 use.</li>
    <li> I used this maybe 3 or 4 times - didn&#x27;t use a lot, just sprayed on my roots on top - and it was gone.  I liked that it made my hair LOOK clean, but it didn&#x27;t feel clean.  I am not a big fan of the smell either. Not buying again.</li>
    <li> I bought this on the recommendation of my hairdresser (following feedback from other clients.)  I didn&#x27;t find it very effective, until I tried blow drying my hair after spraying the product in my hair.  Just rubbing with my hand or brushing my hair wasn&#x27;t enough.  But the heat of the hair dryer seemed to activate the spray. I go running during my lunch breaks, and I use this after showering so I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair for a second time each day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the \\&quot;hair falling out\\&quot; situation people are reporting.  Strange!  Not my experience at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I adore this product.  I have darker, auburn hair.  My hair has been oily since i was a child, but it is also very fine, so I don&#x27;t like to shampoo, condition and style it every day.  It gets easily over-processed. Suave Professionals Dry Shampoo dulls the oil and gives my hair body.  It&#x27;s terrific!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using baby powder because I&#x27;d tried various products and all were too powdery, too smelly, ineffective  and - usually - extremely expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is almost perfect!  In my opinion, there are 2 \\&quot;cons\\&quot;: I do not like the packaging because I try to be a little \\&quot;green\\&quot; and this is not recyclable where I live.  Secondly, the fragrance is pleasant but strong. Otherwise I would definitely give 5 stars!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the expensive brands of dry shampoo and found none to be better than the Suave Professionals.  My hair is thick but very fine.  I use this product every morning after washing and drying my hair to give me the needed volume which holds all day long.  One can will last me at least 2-3 weeks.  Not sure about these people that are getting 2 uses out of a can.  I also use it in my teenage daughters hair when she goes a day without washing to dry up the oil.  She loves it too.  I often find it in her gym bag after taking it to school to use after PE.  I agree with other user that I wish there was a darker spray for those that are not blonde but I can blend it in so that it&#x27;s not noticeable at all.  I will continue my love affair with my dry shampoo.  Just can&#x27;t do without it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been using a differnt Dry Shampoo brand that I&#x27;d bought on amazon for a couple of months but after running out, I decided to purchace another while I was out shopping. I&#x27;ve always had good luck with Suave products and wasn&#x27;t really detered by the cheap cost. Well, after using it just once, I plan to definately spend a few more bucks and get a better product. This dry shampoo is horrible. Like I said, I&#x27;ve only ever used 2 types (this being the 2nd) but could immediately tell the difference. First, the smell resembles dish-washing detergent. Second, it is nearly impossible to perfectly smooth it into your hair. It left mine so sticky it felt as if I purposly took hairspray and sprayed in the same area over and over. Hours later, the sprayed sections feel crunchy to the touch.  NOT the look I was going for. Do yourself a favor and spend a little extra, especially if, like me, you have oily hair. The brand I really like and bought here is Batiste Dry Shampoo Tropical Hair. Again, it doesn&#x27;t have the best smell (I swear none of them do!) but it really works well. Hardly any effort to use. Stay far away from Suave.</li>
    <li> I tried Tresemme, I tried Batiste, I tried expensive salon brands.  For the price, this is the best.  It&#x27;s lightweight, when you follow instructions you don&#x27;t get the white powder, it smells great, and it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair heavy (I have thick but fine hair).</li>
    <li> I will start out telling you a little bit about me.  I love reading all the reviews before I purchase a product and sometimes feel that having some information on the writer/reviewer would help me put things into perspective so here goes.  I have loooong (well middle of the back) straight, dark brown hair that gets oily after about 20 hours.  See, now you can compare hair and see if this product will work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I absolutely love this product.  I have tried many other dry shampoo products on the market but honestly, they always make my hair look like I&#x27;ve dumped a bunch of baby powder on my head because of the white residue that it leaves behind.  No matter how much I \\&quot;worked\\&quot; the product into my hair it always made my hair 2 shades lighter and I hated it.  Not with Suave dry shampoo though.  A little goes a long way and it instantly dries and makes my hair look like I just washed and styled it.  It does give my hair some texture (which I find helpful in holding a curl) that someone with curly hair may not like but if you&#x27;re like me with long, straight, dark hair this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the scent too.  It is a little strong if you use a lot of the product but it will dissipate with time and leave a nice, fresh, citrusy scent  but remember a little goes a long way too.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews that say they&#x27;ve used it two or three times and the bottle is empty...but that has not been the case with me.  I&#x27;ve used it three times already (just once in the morning when I don&#x27;t want to wash my hair) and it has kept my hair looking clean and fresh for the ENTIRE day and I still have well over half a can left. So if you&#x27;re looking for a very reasonably priced dry shampoo I urge you to give this product a try, especially if you have dark hair like me and are tired of looking like you dumped flour or baby powder on your head.</li>
    <li> I will definitely buy this product again.  The scent is super fresh and not overpowering.  Works just as well as more expensive ($20-range) brands.  It absorbs oil and adds volume and life to my hair toward the middle/end of the day.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have bought this product twice and I am extremely disappointed in it. The first time I bought it I was very happy with the results; I didn&#x27;t feel the need to wash my hair or even throw it up in a ponytail. But the next time I went to use it, the sprayer clogged completely. I thought it was because I accidentally left it laying down instead of standing up, so I threw it away and bought another bottle. Same thing happened but I had left it upright this time. When I shake the bottle it sounds like there is hardly anything left in it and when I try to spray, nothing comes out. I will try to run warm water through the sprayer later and see if that works, but it&#x27;s very irritating to have to do this after only the second use! You definitely get what you pay for; this is a cheaply-made product and I will be purchasing a different brand of dry shampoo next time.</li>
    <li> Overall this is a pretty darn good dry shampoo.  I&#x27;ve tried several.  I prefer the aerosol as opposed to the foams.  The foams seem to make the hair a bit greasier.  Anyway I stopped shampooing my hair daily.  But some days I do put product in my hair and the next morning I want a fresh start without rewashing my hair.  So, I have tried some dry shampoos.  This has a great smell very citrusy, sort of pineappley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, best bet, just spray your roots.  Shake the can, hold it 12 to 15 inches from your head, spray your roots.  You can massage it in a little.  Be careful not to damage your hair cuticles by over rubbing the hair.  Then I like to brush the rest of the dry shampoo through my hair using my boar bristle brush.  (I like the Isinis brush).  The one problem I have with dry shampoos is that the dry shampoos usually come out sort of a white powder color.  I have dark brown almost black hair and when you spray a white powder to my roots, no matter how well I brush it in, I inevitably miss a little and it either looks like I&#x27;m going gray or I have hair discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this works great.  My only issue is that I wish they would make a dark hair color variety.  I believe Batiste dry shampoo makes a colored variety, also a good brand for dry shampoo.  But I really do like how this brand smells and how accessible this is.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried one other dry shampoo, and it was horrible.  I saw this one in the grocery store today, and with the price, I decided it was worth trying.  I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair today, and it was quite humid and warm out so my hair, especially my side-swoop bangs, was looking a little greasy.  I don&#x27;t always have time for a shower before heading out to run errands, and today was one of those days.  After I got home, I tried the dry shampoo right away, and it took the grease right out!  My hair looks like it did after I styled it yesterday, and it smells fantastic!  I&#x27;m so excited to find this out!  Just for the record, I&#x27;ve tried Suave&#x27;s other \\&quot;salon\\&quot; products more recently, the \\&quot;Aveda\\&quot;-like shampoo and conditioner (black raspberry) and they smell and work fantastically.  I&#x27;ve never been happier with Suave, they are definitely doing something right!</li>
    <li> It won&#x27;t matter to you whether this product works or not - it has such a stong perfumey smell that you&#x27;d be better off with oily hair. You&#x27;ll want to shampoo your hair anyway.  peeeyooo.</li>
    <li> I received this product in the mail and it was completely empty. The bottle wouldn&#x27;t produce any sort of spray material. I ordered it to have after my surgery and I didn&#x27;t have time to deal with the horrible product I received before my surgery.   Complete disappointment. Hope you can sleep well with the money you made off of me.</li>
    <li> I actually really like this dry shampoo. For me, the key to having a long-lasting dry shampoo is to do only a couple of quick bursts onto your hair, that way it&#x27;ll last longer.  As far as how it works, it really pumps up my hair. It gives it a real boost, especially at the roots.   My hair color is dark brown, and I can&#x27;t notice the flakes from this shampoo at all, which is awesome because no one wants to walk around looking like the have dandruff all day.  Overall, I would recommend this. It took care of the oil on my scalp and has actually lasted quite long for me!</li>
    <li> You really can&#x27;t beat the price for this dry shampoo. It works great- just as advertised! The fragrance is kind of strong but nice. Also, if you use too much it can leave your hair feeling over-dry. But it goes back to normal after a regular wash. I have only used one other kind of dry shampoo so don&#x27;t have much to compare this to, but I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this stuff. It works really well for my hair (thin). Before buying this, I would spend $30 on some of the higher end dry shampoos. I&#x27;ve tried Fekkai, Oscar Blandi, Treseme, and plain cornstarch. I wash my hair every three days and this stuff is perfect for it. It gets rid of the oil and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel like it&#x27;s full of gunk or build up.  Several commenters mention the smell. It does take awhile to get used to, but honestly, I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on it, and much prefer the light citrus smell to anything else I&#x27;ve tried before.  The spray format is perfect, because it adds volume. I sometimes spray it on my hair even after I&#x27;ve washed it as a styling tool to build volume and texture.  Commenters have also mentioned the fact that it runs out fast. This is true. I probably go through a can a week. But at less than $3 a can, I figure it&#x27;s like buying a gallon of milk, which I also buy every week.</li>
    <li> WOW, there is almost NOTHING in this thing. I used it two times, and went to use it again today. EMPTY. I felt like I bought the product and never even really used it. When I did use it, the first time: I put a little in my hair just to try it. The smell is over powering and I had this white gunk in my hairbrush. I guess that&#x27;s normal? The second time I used it, I felt like my hair was less greasy but the smell was just so bad that I had to stop. I thought I&#x27;d try it out one more time today... but EMPTY/GONE. Yep, this thing is gone. Gone off my dresser and off my hair style list! Wouldn&#x27;t recommend at all.</li>
    <li> I thought this product was great! I have very oily hair and my hairstylist recommended a dry shampoo because I had to wash my hair at least once a day. I tried one from the salon first, which worked fine, but I didn&#x27;t think it was worth the price. I got this and another brand to try at the same time. This was the cheapest out of all that I have tried, and it works the best! I have dark blonde hair with light blond highlights, so I had to make sure that I did not spray on too much and that I brushed it in afterward so the powder did not show. This product did not work well for my mother&#x27;s hair, which is dark brown, because of the powder in it. I have also used baby powder in the past. The dry shampoo is soooo much easier to use, is more efficient, and makes the whole process quicker and less messy. When applying the dry shampoo, the smell can be overwhelming to the user. I was not sure if I liked the smell at first. It has a citrus smell to it. But other people that I have been around later after using it have told me that they like the smell of my hair and thinks its fresh smelling. It also changes the texture of my hair. It makes it thicker and fuller. Since my hair tends to be flat with a thin texture, I think this is a great feature. I am really glad that I found this product. It allows me to get ready much more quickly than having to wash my hair every morning. Even if I wash my hair the night before, I still use this product in the morning to keep my hair looking fresh throughout the day. Love it!</li>
    <li> its a great way to stretch your hair between shampoos. I have very fine hair and have to shampoo nearly everyday. This has been a great option.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  Smells awesome too.  Adds a lot of body to my straight, greasy, lifeless hair, great product!</li>
    <li> I have dry hair, so I try to only wash it a few times a week. I usually blow dry/flat iron it straight, so I cause a lot of damage each time I wash. My hair usually starts to get oily after a day, but this product really helped with that! It helped to add volume and decrease the oil. It also smells great! I&#x27;ve heard some people complain that it leaves a white powder in your hair, but I didnt have that problem at all. It might be because I have a lighter color (red) hair, so it doesnt stand out as much. This was the first dry shampoo I tried and I love it.</li>
    <li> Great for keeping your hair from having that greasy look and feel in between shampoos.</li>
    <li> I had previously bought a can of the Tresemme dry shampoo.  It never made it through a while day, the can often got clogged, and I needed a brush specific to days that I used the product because it left so much residue.  With the Suave, I spray some into my roots at night and again in the morning and my hair looks great all day.  I don&#x27;t know how much everybody else is using, but I use this about once a week and have had it for months and it&#x27;s not empty yet.  If some people are only getting one use out of it, maybe they are clogging the can and it&#x27;s not really empty or they are using a HUGE amount.  I only use a few seconds of spray on my fine blond hair and work it through with my fingers.  It can feel a little product-y, but I can use the body.</li>
    <li> I have extremely oily hair and depend on dry shampoo (Batiste is the best) to get me through those rare days when I don&#x27;t bother to wash my hair.  So I bought this Suave product in an attempt to save some money.  Well, you get what you pay for.  I followed the directions exactly and at first my hair looked okay, but within an hour it was oilier than it had been before I used it!  None of the dry shampoos smell very good and it hasn&#x27;t bothered me in my attempts to find something cheaper than Batiste.  But THIS one?!  Yikes!  The odor literally nauseated me and I couldn&#x27;t get it out of my nose once I was done using.  Very nasty stuff.  I&#x27;m throwing my can in my Goodwill box, hoping they&#x27;ll only charge a quarter for it, saving some unsuspecting soul, who thinks she just has to try it out, a little money.  You&#x27;ve been warned!</li>
    <li> I ordered this dry sampoo online because i needed .30 cents to get the super shipper savings. I was really excited to get the package until I opened it! The bottle wasnt in ANY kind of rapping! The cap was gone and the bottle was wedged into the side of the box. When i picked up the bottle i felt nothing in there! yes. dry shampoo is quite light but this thing was empty! Also there was dried products on the cap proving that it had leaked. when i got my other purchase out of the box i also found oil from the dry shampoo under the other product. A total waist of 2 dollers. I trust Amazon....but maybe not so much thier shipping.</li>
    <li> If it worked, I could maybe get past the smell. I kept reapplying thinking I didn&#x27;t get enough on, but it just kept getting worse. Plus, it smells SO BAD. Like rotting melon or something. I&#x27;ll be trashing this one.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product. I bought it when I was running low of another brand of dry shampoo. It sat virtually unused on my shelf for a couple weeks (I had tested it when I first bought it). When I went to use it, the can was completely empty. I had thought it was a fluke, maybe there was a leak in the can. So I bought another bottle and the SAME THING HAPPENED. Used it once or twice, sat for about 2 weeks, went to use it again and it was completely empty.    Do not waste your money! Try Tresemme&#x27;s dry shampoo instead. It worked fine for me (and smells better too, in my opinion).</li>
    <li> I am a professional and I educate all of my guests on DRY SHAMPOO!  ITS&#x27; A GOD SEND WHEN YOU WAKE UP LATE, go to a restaurant and your hair smells like fried food, have oily hair that goes limp by noon.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone should be using dry shampoo.  It extends the life of haircolour, allows your hair to receive natural oils for more days between washes, is great for after a workout.....&lt;br /&gt;  PureOlogy is the professional brand that I would recommend. They also have a DRY CONDITION for the ends of your hair.  However, for the value and performance, YOU CANNOT GO WRONG WITH SUAVE DRY SHAMPOO.  Try it. It will change your life🌸</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy-curly long hair which I wash/straighten every 2-3 days. I use a dry shampoo on the non-washing days. This has worked very well for me. I mainly use it only at the hairline and at the crown, and I have not had the problem others have had of only getting 2-3 uses out of the bottle. Maybe I&#x27;m using less product than they are though. If you have a very oily scalp dry shampoos can only do so much. This has worked well, blended in easily (unlike some brands which leave a dusty residue even after working it in) and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product. UPDATE 4/13: I have gone through several bottles of this product. The last time I purchased, I noticed the can is dispensing a greater volume of product with each spray, and I do think I&#x27;m going through it much faster. I think this is a defect in the dispensing mechanism and shows a quality control issue. I can now understand where some of the other reviewers are coming from. I went through at least five or six bottles before getting one that did this. Suave needs to look into this.</li>
    <li> I love Suave dry shampoo because it makes my hair full, gets rid of the oil and the smell is fresh - I love it! I do agree it runs out fast, however. Also, if you are a brunette or redhead it will probably make your hair white. Blondes can rub it a bit and the white color dissipates. I just bought Batiste and Pssssst! because they are on sale so I&#x27;m curious to see how it compares. I&#x27;ve also used Oscar Blandi before this and I like it too. However, I much prefer the convenience and ease of a spray rather than a powder and shake of the head.</li>
    <li> I recently moved and the new location/water was making my roots super greasy so I bought this product. It was going fine for a while, although I didn&#x27;t like the smell too much the price was right. But all of a suddenly, my roots are dry and cracking as if I had bleached my hair 4 times in a row. I had no clue how this could have happened to my roots, since that is meant to be the most healthy hair and I didn&#x27;t dye my hair forever. This morning I went to straighten my hair and the gross roots literally melted together and a huge chunk of my hair fell out. Now I have a giant patch right on my hairline that is like an inch long. I&#x27;m pretty upset because I&#x27;m growing my hair out and now I feel like a freak. I&#x27;m hoping for some kind of shampoo that might help the rest of my roots from doing this? Suggestions would be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE DONT BUY!</li>
    <li> I have very oily, thin hair and a high-maintenance toddler, so I don&#x27;t always get to shower when I want to (if I shower in the evening, my hair is greasy by morning!).  I&#x27;ve tried the expensive salon dry shampoos and I&#x27;ve tried the cheap drugstore brands, and this stuff is seriously the best.  I&#x27;m so glad I discovered it!  I almost didn&#x27;t give it a go after I tried another discount brand (TreSemme) and actually threw it out, it was so bad.  The Suave spray disappears completely in my medium-brown hair, and it completely eliminates oiliness while giving me texture.  The smell is strong, but that seems to be true of all dry shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair, but wear a sew in weave (human hair) from time to time to give my own hair a rest. Like all scalps, it has its own oils; which causes the hair to have an oily look. Also, at night upon waking up in the morning, my hair would be flat. The \\&quot;eliminates oil\\&quot; attracted me to the product. The smell is not that overwhelming, and the citrus smell does not linger. I do not spray this on my scalp, just on the hair. After a few sprays/tousling/brushing, my hair is revived and smashed bed hair is gone. I would definitely recommend this product to revive curls and get rid of the oily/smashed bed hair look for a few days.  Note: If sprayed too close to the hair or too much, it will leave a white spot. To get rid of it, just finger comb or brush through the hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from psssst to serge normant. This is hands down the best. I dye my hair red every few weeks, so going two or three days without washing is essential to keeping the color. This is the only dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried that smells smells great, completely revives my day 3 hair, restores body, and doesn&#x27;t leave residue. Plus, if you find it in a Walmart or target, it&#x27;s usually only $2-$3. This, and bumble and bumble&#x27;s tonic lotion, make maintaining vibrant color effortless.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great, smells good (citrus smell), and seems to last quite a long time for a $3.49 can.  It is the cheapest dry shampoo I have seen out there and it works the best.  Need I say more?  Oh well I guess I should mention that I have natural blond hair, so the powder that the spray leaves is a little noticeable, but not much and as soon as I brush it the powder disappears.  Great for blond hair!</li>
    <li> Fabulous product! Great fragrance that lingers. Works great on human hair, and also does a great job of taking down the shine on a new hairpiece!</li>
    <li> My everyday product! Even when my hair is clean,  I give my roots a tiny blast for volume. Smells great and lasts a long time. Doesn&#x27;t show on my dark hair after its brushed in.</li>
    <li> For the time I was able to use this I liked the product. Unfortunately I only used it twice and now it won&#x27;t spray anymore. Should have listened to the other review because it can&#x27;t be returned since it&#x27;s an aerosol.</li>
    <li> Having had greasy hair all my life and having to wash my hair EVERY day, I was excited to try some of the new dry shampoo products that are on the market now.  The first one I tried was Pssssssssst! It works pretty good but it smells horrible! I also tried Not Your Mother&#x27;s dry shampoo. I like it pretty well. I used Tressemme for a while but it seems kind of heavy and coats the hair too much so I picked up a can of the Suave one day on impulse, thinking that it would be comparable to the Tressemme. Wow, I was surprised! It smells much better and leaves my hair looking great. I went from washing my hair every day to washing it every 3 days if I so choose!  This is a low priced product that works great!</li>
    <li> Love the smell.  It lessens the &amp;#34;oily look&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;So glad that I found it online.  It may cost a little bit more BUT it&lt;br /&gt;saves me a trip to the store where I would buy a dozen other things I may not really need.</li>
    <li> Great smell - easy to use and it really works. Such a terrific idea for when you can&#x27;t or don&#x27;t want to get your head wet but still want to have your hair look and smell clean.</li>
    <li> left hair feeling grosse</li>
    <li> This has a strong perfume smell which really bothers me because it seems overpowering to me. That smell has made me shy away from using this too often. When I did use it, it did seem to improve the oily appearance of my roots, but I do not find it to be a wonder product and I will definitely not repurchase this.</li>
    <li> I had a free coupon for Suave Professionals, so I thought I would try the dry shampoo.  I usually use an expensive salon brand.  I think this actually works better than the salon brand.  I know people have commented on the smell.  I do not find it over-powering. When I use it, I spray it on, then use my fingers to rub it into my scalp. It dries up the oiliness completely and keeps my hair clean all day.  I don&#x27;t think it feels that gross.  If you have never used dry shampoo before, you may have to get used to your hair feeling a bit different, but not really different than other dry shampoos.      About people writing that it empties out quickly--this sounds like a production problem.  I had the same thing happen with my expensive salon brand once, too.  They should just return it to the store.</li>
    <li> I love dry shampoo. I have really thick hair and it saves me a ton of time to just spray this on my roots between washings so I don&#x27;t have to wash and blow dry every day. I was using TIGI Rockaholic Dirty Secret Dry Shampoo, which is about 4 x more expensive and smells dirty. Suave&#x27;s version is a lot cheaper and smells really pleasant. I&#x27;m glad I tried it, it will save me a lot of money over the years and I no longer have to be self conscious about how my hair smells!</li>
    <li> I think they have updated the amount of product you get in here, the spray now lasts me a good month before running out! Refreshes greasy hair well and gives volume. I also really love the smell, but its quite strong and some people might not like that.</li>
    <li> I had used a prior formulation of this product.  This one smells terrific.  I like that I can spray it, brush it and go.  Nothing replaces a shower, but if you can&#x27;t for any reason, this is a good alternative for your hair.  My hair is light and sometimes this product makes it look more grey, which I don&#x27;t love, but hey, there are always trade offs.  This product is convenient, easy to use and store, and makes hair that is a little too greasy look fresh again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds but keep going back to this one. It smells great and gets your hair clean and removes oil. Great price too</li>
    <li> I purchased Suave Dry Shampoo after receiving a coupon for BOGO Suave Professionals Styling Products.  I normally use Batiste Blush, but decided to give this a try because it was such a good deal!  WRONG.    With the Blush product, I get about 20 uses out of it.  However, with the Suave, I get 3 to 5.  Remember, I tried two different cans.  The first can I got 5 uses, the second only 3.  After the last use I put the can away feeling like everything was normal.  The can felt mostly full.  The next day when I went to use it (both cans, 2 diff days) there was no aerosol pressure.  The can felt nearly empty of both air AND shampoo (you can hear a bit inside shaking around).    I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s user error - I&#x27;ve been using Batiste Blush dry shampoo for 2+ years, so I&#x27;m familiar with the way the product works.  I have written to Suave to complain.  This is just ridiculous!  But the cheap price is indicative of the product you&#x27;ll receive.  You&#x27;re better off to buy a slightly more expensive dry shampoo and get a better value for the product.    Pros: Low price, product works as advertised (it definitely soaks up excess oil), GREAT SMELL  Cons: Bad value, product dispenser design seems faulty, doesn&#x27;t last</li>
    <li> it make your hair smell lovely, just like you just washed it. But it leaves a white residue behind. You have to spray it from far back</li>
    <li> Luckily I didn&#x27;t pay for the can of \\&quot;dry shampoo\\&quot; I picked up at our local grocery store because Suave was kind enough to send me a coupon for a freebie. I used this product 1 time and thought WOW... this is really cool. Then I told my neighbor about it and she ran straight out to get a can for herself. Well fast forward a couple days and about 3 uses later our can had completly emptied itself. I had read some reviews about this happening and couldn&#x27;t imagine how that was possible. Turns out the same thing happened to my neighbor as well. She had only used her product 1 time before the can emptied. What a waste...</li>
    <li> I used it 3 times and then i go to use it a week later...........and what? ALL GONE?  My sister had the same problem....she used hers a few times then it was gone hmmmm.  Either you dont get much or it drys up?? Not happy!</li>
    <li> I used Pssssst for years and while I like both products very much, I still like the price and the smell of the Suave better.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve tried lots of dry shampoos--including expensive salon brands. This one is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried. I especially give it 5 stars because of the price! Near exact quality as the expensive stuff, but for 1/5 of the price? Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> It works really well, but the smell is horrible. So horrible that I had to hop in the shower and wash my hair. Kind of defeats the purpose a little. If you can stand the smell of it, then this is a good, cheap dry shampoo. I would advise trying to smell it first before buying it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through 3 cans of this, and though I didn&#x27;t experience the single use problem, I do agree I go through more of this faster than any other hair product.  I use it 4 days a week, and go through 3 cans in two months.  I estimate that I get 10-12 uses per can.  Is it worth it though?  Absolutely!  I love the texture it gives, and the white residue is less obvious than other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s a good thing I took the advice of another reviewer to use the item the night before it has a chance to get greasy.  FOr example, I usually bathe in the evening. So I spray this on in the evening when I&#x27;ve determined to skip washing my hair, just at the roots, and the next day my hair stays ungreasy all day.  By then the scent (which I know some will find overpowering) is faint enough that it just seems like I used a pineapple-scented shampoo. And my hair, oh my hair is nice and voluminous!  I like my second day hair better than freshly washed now, thanks to this product.  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> It works well, but as others have said, it runs out incredibly quickly. I got about 5 uses out of it, which just seems crazy, especially given the size of the bottle. Trying Pssst next.</li>
    <li> The smell of the dry shampoo is utterly nauseating! It takes a lot of product to work. Will not recommended.</li>
    <li> The can contained about three uses&#x27; worth of dry shampoo. Anything that runs out that quickly is not worth buying. The product itself isn&#x27;t bad, though, but the peachy smell is a bit strong.</li>
    <li> This is a horrible product.  The first bottle I bought I used once and then the contents of the bottle disappeared. I thought that I bought a bad aerosol bottle that had a leak in it, so I ended up buying another bottle and the same thing happened. I wasted money on two bottles that disappeared into air.  Never again.  DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at the grocery store for $2.99.  Bottom line, it works great, is easy to use, and does exactly what it says it does.  It smells a lot flowery, and this I don&#x27;t really love, but for such a great price, I learned to live with it.  The bottle, on the other hand is a whole different issue, and here is where my love affair with this product ends. I have now purchased 2 bottles of this product.  The first bottle I used exactly twice and when I went to use it a third time I was surprised to find it empty.  I thought this was a fluke and that maybe I had gotten a bottle someone had tried out at the store or something.  I purchased a second bottle, making sure that it was full, and used it exactly once.  The next time I went to use it, 4 days later, it was empty.  It seems that the bottles (which I capped and stored in a cool, dry place) are emptying themselves even though I can find no evidence of this in my closet.  I really like this product and would give it a rave review if I could get more than one or two uses out of it.  I am pretty disappointed.</li>
    <li> i love the way this dry shampoo smells. works very well for my hair. i have naturally thick and wavy hair. great product to use.</li>
    <li> this is my best kept hair secret!  I don&#x27;t like to wash my hair everyday and this dry shampoo allows me 3-4 days between washings.  I have very oily hair so I don&#x27;t leave home without this stuff.  I would recommend only for blondes as I tried it in my sister&#x27;s hair (she has brown hair) and it makes her hair look grey.  Suave also offers a dry conditioner if you need a little help with tangles after using the dry shampoo.  LOVE THIS STUFF!!!</li>
    <li> Suave Professionals Dry Shampoo caused major hair loss for me. At first I LOVED it, however after a few months I noticed that my hair was getting thinner and thinner, then I noticed balding patches on the areas where I mostly concentrated on using the dry shampoo. I have very oily hair so this was a god sent, now I am left with bald patches trying to figure out where to go from here. I went to a dermatologist who said that the dry shampoo sucks up the oil leaving it on your scalp therefore clogging your hair follicles making the hair fall out and stunting regrowth. As of today I am starting to use Nizoral shampoo which is for dandruff (I don&#x27;t have dandruff, but the Dr told me this will help with regrowth because it will reopen the clogged follicles). I spoke to my friend who was also using the Suave Professionals Dry Shampoo (on my recommendation) and was complaining of her hair thinning. I just told her and she said that she started noticing the hair loss since she has been using the product. It may work at first, it may be a great price, but the lasting effects are unbearable. I am so self conscience now and can not wait for my hair to grow back. Please do not buy this product. I am so upset that I am ready to go to a lawyer because of this.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from Amazon and was happy to receive it so quickly, however, I was a bit disappointed that it too came with no instructions for use and it did not have the \\&quot;staying power\\&quot; I found with other dry shampoo&#x27;s (sure wish I could find Pssssst which was another dry shampoo that had excellent staying power of up to three days!).  if anyone knows where I can find it pleeeezzzz let me know.  The ingredient list is hard to read on the bottle, it would have been nice to have it written and enclosed with the product.</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo has become difficult to find for some reason.  It has a great smell and is useful after a trip to the gym, or on days when I don&#x27;t wash my hair.  Can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> I have long, straight thin hair that gets oilier on the scalp and around my temples much faster than everywhere else, so a quick spritz of this stuff staves off the need to actually shampoo for another day. Washing my hair every day dries it out like crazy, so this definitely takes care of the problem of having dirty-looking hair without subjecting it to real shampoo every single day. I don&#x27;t use very much, since I&#x27;m not spraying it on my whole head or using it every day, so one bottle lasted me a good 4 weeks, and it really smells terrific and tangerine-y. A few downsides are that it does make my hair look noticeably less shiny and there are occasionally flakes left over from the powder, but in my case, the benefits definitely outweigh the downsides.</li>
    <li> My wife absolutely loves this stuff, I thought it would just be a normal cheapy thing, but she absolutely raves about it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the expensive brands of dry shampoo and have to say that this definitely holds it&#x27;s own among them.  I would def buy again.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells AMAZING. Like coconuts and something fruity, very tropical without being overbearing. You could honestly forgo any perfume and just use this stuff in your hair. I&#x27;ve had compliments but, more importantly, I love smelling my own hair after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the actual performance, I have dry, frizzy, limp, fine hair. I get oily at my roots and alskdhfalkhdf at the tips and lots of tangles by the second day, and I&#x27;m a twice-weekly shampooer so this is really troublesome. Suave does the job for me. It clears up the oil and tames the frizz, giving my hair tons of body. It doesn&#x27;t last all day long because, well, gravity and stuff... but this stuff is so cheap and smells so good that I can always just spray in a bit more to fluff back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as I&#x27;m concerned, it does what it should. It&#x27;s not some miracle product that will let you roll out of bed looking like a VS model but it will clean the oil up and give you some body for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, and for the smell, I will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> What a waste of money!  The only good thing is that it doesn&#x27;t cost very much.  I have used other products that work great but not this one.  I usually have to wash my hair every day or wear it in a pony tail.  I have been using other dry shampoos and they work great for me so thought I would try this one because its cheaper and you sure get what you pay for.  This product does nothing!  It does smell pretty good but you can always put something on your hair that does that.  Don&#x27;t waste your molney on this even though it is cheap.</li>
    <li> My coworker recommended this product because his girlfriend and sister-in-law raved about it.  Yes, I know... I should be slapped on the wrist for taking beauty advice from a man.  After buying this product and experiencing some issues, I learned that both his girlfriend and sister-in-law are blonde.  This chick right here -- brunette.  Problems?  There was one big difference in results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do not have very light-colored hair, then this following recommendation is a must-do, absolute necessity, requirement numero uno!  Apply ONLY to your roots.  Otherwise you will walk out the door looking like your grandma.  Now, I love my grandma.  She is a beautiful woman and has aged very, very well.  I hope that those graceful aging genes were passed along to me.  However, her late eighties head of hair does not belong in my late twenties &#x27;do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spraying the shampoo anywhere beyond the immediate roots will leave gray to white streaks in your hair.  The instructions direct you to use the heat from the palm of your hand to massage any excess shampoo into your hair/scalp.  Tried this, minimal results.  I tried brushing it out.  No luck.  Only an actual wash with my regular shampoo restored my natural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, brushing it out removed some of the intended effect and made my roots look oily again.  Hence reapplication.  Grrr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I can only apply this very closely to my roots instead of tussling my hair while spraying, I have to systematically separate my hair into areas where my hair appears oily.  Not only is it more time-consuming than it should be, but it also uses up a lot more of the shampoo than it should.  One can of this lasted me about two weeks (I used it a couple of times a week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware.  This stuff dries your hair out.  I&#x27;ve seen some other people complain that it actually made their hair fall out (uh, yikes).  All of my hair is still intact, fortunately.  However, it is noticeably drier and more brittle.  I would recommend using this sparingly and sticking to a regular wet wash cycle when possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros I have noticed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) For the most part, it reduces the oily appearance of your hair.  However, I recommend that you avoid brushing the roots of your hair as much as possible after you apply.  Start brushing further down on the strands so you don&#x27;t remove the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It smells pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) It volumizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in the end, it can be considered okay on a good day.  Meh.  I&#x27;m definitely going to try out some other brands.I would recommend using this sparingly and sticking to a regular wet wash cycle when possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros I have noticed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) For the most part, it reduces the oily appearance of your hair.

    <li> I really liked the dry shampoo, it helps those that have super greasy hair the next day or if you want to give it a little extra hold. Plus its salon quality which makes it even more amazing!</li>
    <li> I have fairly oily hair and this product helps me get through an evening out when I don&#x27;t have time to re-wash my bangs.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this product. I thought it would at least smell nice, but it has a horrible smell.  It didn&#x27;t make my hair feel fresh, just a bit stinky.</li>
    <li> First off, it has a weird sweet smell.  I&#x27;m not a fan, but it&#x27;s not abrasive (my boyfriend doesn&#x27;t mind it).  The product leaves my hair feeling heavy and thick. But there&#x27;s no greasy sheen which is what I want it for.  When I use it, I can&#x27;t leave my hair down, but it works great if I braid it, or put it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice for those days when I&#x27;m up late, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be nice this summer during festivals.</li>
    <li> It gives hair body even just after washing and drying keeps hair looking like it has body all day long.</li>
    <li> Works fairly well and smells much better than another one I&#x27;ve tried.  It does feel a little sticky but I comb it and go.  It&#x27;s great in a pinch!</li>
    <li> A few months back, I wanted to stop washing my hair every day and started trying different dry shampoos. The others I tried left my hair sticky, or didn&#x27;t smell good, or left a powdery appearance. I tried this product right when it came out, and it works so much better than other products! The biggest benefit is the scent- it smells great! Citrusy and fresh, but not over powering.     As for the actual performance of the product, I find it makes my roots less oily and leaves my hair feeling soft and clean. It doesn&#x27;t work as well as actually washing your hair, but it does allow me to skip a day or two between washing and keeps my hair from looking greasy.    Keys to success with this product: Hold the bottle about a foot from your head to prevent clumps/stickiness. Use your fingers to rub it in, and then brush it out. It&#x27;s usually roots that get oily first, so focus on spraying towards the top of your head and rub it in to your scalp.</li>
    <li> Due to my job, I am on foot running from one area of the city to another area. By the end of the day, my hair is oily from sweat. I&#x27;ve got thick, coarse, long, Asian hair. I don&#x27;t have the means to shower before going out so I end up with greasy hair all night.  I was curious about trying dry shampoos but didn&#x27;t want to spend $25 on something I didn&#x27;t know would work or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Suave Dry Shampoo and it works pretty well. Even though the can is the size of typical hair spray bottle, it only has 5 oz of product inside so be careful when spraying or you&#x27;ll use all the product and have a gray head. I first section my hair and spray my roots for one second. It take about six quick sprays to cover my head. That&#x27;s all I need to get the oily feeling/look from the top of my head. I then vigorously brush out my hair. I&#x27;ve used the product three times now and it seems like I&#x27;ve got some left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two bonuses for me: Suave Dry Shampoo does add volume so I don&#x27;t have to tease it for that \\&quot;going-out\\&quot; look and the can itself is super light so its not a big deal to toss it to my bag.</li>
    <li> Suave Professionals Dry Shampoo leaves a rough residue.         I have learned to try out dry shampoos for the first time before I take a shower or on a day I stay at home and not before running out the door to see if it leaves residue.  I am glad I did that with this product.  I have naturally straight hair  with a silky texture while it is very thick.  It is best for me to not wash it everyday but it gets greasy very easily.  I find dry shampoos are a good solution.         When I saw suave was coming out with one and I had a coupon to get it free I found it at my local Target.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend any money on this product because I will not be using it again.  I used it on a day I stayed at home and I ended up having to take a shower after a few hours because I couldn&#x27;t stand the rough residue it left.  It smelled good and got rid of the grease but the residue was ridiculous.  I tried to brush it out with my bristle brush but it would not come out.  I had to shampoo twice just to get rid of it.         In conclusion, if you have rough textured hair this would probably work fine but if you have smooth hair do NOT get this.  Stick to Baltiste because that is the best one I have found for my smooth hair.  Baltiste Diva has a good scent and it works well</li>
    <li> I felt this dry shampoo was barely adequate in doing its job - yes it seemed to absorb some of the oil, but it was too heavy a product for my fine hair (and I didn&#x27;t like how it felt).  But the thing that really turned me off was the strong smell.  I bought this to use in lieu of baby powder because I don&#x27;t want to smell like a baby, but this reminded me of a cheap body spray I would have used in middle school.  Forget any other scents you might be wearing because you now smell like a tropical room freshener.  Dislike :(</li>
    <li> I give this product 1 star because I can&#x27;t give it a Zero. I bought this porduct as a 2 for one deal thinking I was saving money over my normal brand. ( i usually use John Freida) Anyways, I do not like to wash my hair every day, if i did not sweat, so I sprayed this product on my hair and initially it did soak up the oil, but then the smell hit me... It was like a cross between rotting citrus and BO... In fact it smelled so much like BO, that I stopped to smell myself, and the clothes I put on, and the towel I had just used after getting out of the shower a few minutes before. Nope it wasn&#x27;t me, it was the spray, I even had my husband smell it and he agreed. I had to take a second shower to get rid of the aweful odor, I threw both the cans away... This is dissapointing because I like suave products and thought this would be a good one and save me some money....</li>
    <li> I bought this product last week because I&#x27;ve been wanting to try dry shampoos. I used the product twice, and 5 days later I went to use it again and it was all gone. I&#x27;m going to try another brand. Other reviews said they did not like the smell of the product. The smell did not bother me.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a decently priced dry shampoo and have tried various different brands. I have hated all of them as they did NOTHING for my hair. I came to the conclusion that I wouldn&#x27;t been able to find anything I would like until I saw this at the store. I thought there would be no way I would like it, but it works GREAT!!! It smells wonderful and does a great job getting the oil out of my hair. Mqke sure to try it! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have been using dry shampoo for a long time now.  I was so excited that suave came out with a more affordable version. Well, I was excited until I tried it. I have dark hair and was not happy when the first time I sprayed it in my hair it left a white chalky residue.  Most of it can be removed by toweling it, but it still leaves a whitish colored residue.  I have found that most dry shampoos that use starch tend to leave the white haze on my hair.  Dry shampoos that use clay as the absorbant work much better and leave my hair looking clean instead of white. I recommend Salon Grafix Invisible Dry Shampoo. For the price, it is gentle on the hair, has very little scent, really is invisible and does a good job absorbing oil.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d found a great deal but my daughter tells me that this really leaves her hair feeling gritty and heavy.  I don&#x27;t have personal experience with Dry Shampoo sprays but apparently you get what you pay for, in this case.</li>
    <li> I was somewhat skeptical when purchasing this product as I have used similar products before.  However, this dry shampoo from Suave is wonderful &amp; works great!  It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling in my hair nor does it show up as white flakes in my very dark brown hair.  This dry shampoo allows me to go up to 2, sometimes 3, days without washing my hair and helps keep my hair from getting too oily.  Great product for a fabulous price!</li>
    <li> So this was the first dry shampoo I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and it does work VERY well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair felt like it was just washed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day, before I headed out, I decided to use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And...nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I literally got one single use of this product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t worth it to me, even for the cheap price and good outcome...</li>
    <li> Yes this is cheap however you can only use it a few times. If I remember correctly it was only 2-3 times of use. Not sure I like the smell either..</li>
    <li> I like this product but it has a very strong lingering scent that I can&#x27;t handle in my hair all day.  But, maybe that is helpful for hair that is very, very soiled and dirty?  It does refreshen my hair nicely, I just wish the smell wasn&#x27;t so powerful.</li>
    <li> I use this generously in-between washings and it works perfectly!  Not only does it remove the unsightly oily hair look, it gives my hair body and volume.  It also works great to use right after shampooing for volume and to help keep that &amp;#34;freshly washed&amp;#34; looked.  It&#x27;s a great product and I buy it in bulk so I always have it on hand!  It&#x27;s great for traveling too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many dry shampoos and this is my favorite, so far.  I save so much time skipping a day between washes and it doesn&#x27;t build-up like some of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  It smells really fresh which, if your hair easily absorbs odors, like smoke or from being in a table-side cooking restaurant it absorbs and lifts that too.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Other products have worked better and I had to keep moving because of the smell. It has a really powerful aroma that stays with you for many hours. That wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if the fragrance was pleasant but unfortunately it stinks.</li>
    <li> If you aren&#x27;t allergic to corn. This is a corn starch spray. I have black hair. I look like I&#x27;m apart of the Adams Family. Only works on blondes with no allergies to corn. I have black hair and have allergies to corn. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I have tried many dry shampoos but this one really works well.  I don&#x27;t want to shampoo every day and this product can sometimes give me 2 extra days without shampooing.  Try it!</li>
    <li> I use this on a day where my hair is not feeling the cleanest but I don&#x27;t feel like washing it.  It kind of sprays a very light powder on your hair, so you rub in the slightly whiteness into your hair.  It takes the slightly oily look out of my hair and gives it a light powdery scent.  With such great reviews and cheap price, it&#x27;s worth the try!</li>
    <li> This is good too but there are a lot of things to watch out for. One is don&#x27;t smoke if you did this as it&#x27;s highly flammable. But other wise it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> This product works better than most dry shampoo sprays that are 4x the price. My fine, blond hair cannot be washed daily, so this is a great alternative for healthy-looking hair. I will use this as long as it is made.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that loves to get incredibly oily the second day after washing (i.e. wash on Sunday, Tuesday is \\&quot;oil slick\\&quot; day).  I&#x27;ve tried numerous dry shampoos (Tresemme, SG - Salon Grafix, Not your Mother&#x27;s) and the ONLY one that&#x27;s transformed my head of oil back into hair is Suave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that people are giving 1-star ratings for this FABULOUS product simply because of the limited uses is absurd; maybe they had duds (I&#x27;m actually on my 4th use of spraying it like it&#x27;s going out of style and still haven&#x27;t run out - purchased from Target) or maybe not but bottom line is: THIS STUFF WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is THE BEST dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found thus far; but do the research (youtube) or spend $3 to find out for yourself. :-)</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I&#x27;ve used it almost every other day for a month now and still have a lot left in the can. I think the trick to keeping it from gumming up is using five or six quick bursts rather than holding down the nozzle. I rub my scalp just a little to distribute it, and it gives my natural curls more volume then when I wash it the regular way. My favorite part is that it smells like fresh pineapples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that you are spraying a powder, so it tends to clog your pores around the hairline. Be sure to wash your hairline after use.</li>
    <li> This stuff has changed my life. No lie! I have the greasiest hair ever and super flat and thin as well. This stuff is sooooo affordable and makes my hair quite large and amazing without a hint of greasy. I used to buy Ojon from Sephora for $25 a can and it was tiny. This stuff is insane, I recommend it to EVERYONE with flat dull greaseball hair. It does give it a texture, so if you need to have your hair feel silky smooth, perhaps this isn&#x27;t for you but I hope they keep making this stuff for eternity!</li>
    <li> Everyone has one of those mornings where you sleep in too late and don&#x27;t have time to take a shower. Or you just want to run around town in your yoga pants to run errands, but your hair looks ick. This is amazing. Smells good -- but is pretty overpowering when you spray so keep door open. Adds volume to fine, thin hair. The only thing I dislike is that sometimes it seems to irritate my scalp. Not often, but if I use it too frequently.</li>
    <li> I used this product to maintain curly hair between washes...it is horrible! Feels icky &amp; more unclean than before use.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair feel less oily when I apply it but after a few hours it seems like it feels even greasier than it did to begin with. I&#x27;ve used it about 4 times at this point and haven&#x27;t been happy with the results by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo works great, and the smell is really refreshing with a hint of fruit in it.  I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best dry shampoo in regards to absorbing oil and making your hair look fresh and clean. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of different brands and this is my go to. This dry shampoo can be quite heavy so I suggest going light to start so you can&#x27;t see the white powder in your hair.  I have blond hair so it blends in nicely after brushing it out.  Plus you really can&#x27;t beat the price!  The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the fruity scent but the product works so well it&#x27;s easily overlooked.</li>
    <li> AS a dry shampoo it works pretty well, especially out of the 8+ brands I&#x27;ve tried, I&#x27;d probably give it  5 stars for it&#x27;s functionality, but the smell is so horrid I had to give it only 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed other reviewers say they like the smell and at least one said &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on what it smells like,&amp;#34; well, let me tell you, it smells like a bowl of very sweet, very ripe fruit with maybe some subtle floral tones.  So if you want your head to smell like fruit, then go for it.  Personally, I wish it smelled a little more like fresh, clean soap.  Why do all scented dry shampoos have this same fruit bowl scent.  So gross.  Smells like a scented tampon and who wants that on their head?  Too sweet for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, I have not found a single dry shampoo that works well that also smells great, so I don&#x27;t have another product to recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found there are 2 categories of dry shampoo: 1) the traditional &amp;#34;powdery&amp;#34; type (of which Suave is one) that (if done well) looks like you&#x27;ve scattered your head with talc, but (if done well) the white brushes out easily, even on black hair like mine, with a good boar bristle brush and the hair is left less oily (less dirty) and with lots of texture and body. The white stuff (if done right) is actually a finely milled clay that absorbs hair oil.  2) the newer type &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; products that are really a lot more like sticky hairspray.  Personally, this second category of &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; sprays has not proven to work on my fine, straight, limp hair at all.  On the 2nd or 3rd day going without a shampoo, my hair oil really starts to show and these types of dry shampoos do not work for me at all.</li>
    <li> did not make my hair feel clean, All it did was make it look like I put baby powder in it</li>
    <li> Just hate it when I sleep in and don&#x27;t have time to fuss with washing and drying my impossibly thick hair. /This really freshens and lets me get an extra day until I shampoo.It isn&#x27;t heavy lets hair style well.</li>
    <li> what a good product when one cannot wash one&#x27;s hair - it is a pleasure to be able to find something to use - even every day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;!</li>
    <li> I love a dry shampoo and I have tried more expensive versions, but this one works just as good as the more expensive ones, if not better.  You do want to use sparingly b/c it does turn white if you use too much, but if you put your hair upside down, you can brush it out.  I love this new scent too.</li>
    <li> Of all dry shampoos I have tried, this is the BEST!! Works better than the ones that cost more. Leaves less... &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34; than the others, goes on dry, smells nice.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It provides unbelievable volume!  I wash and dry my hair then apply this to the roots, bangs and style as usual with my hair spray.  I can literally go two days where as before I found this, I couldn&#x27;t go 24 hours with out a wash and fresh style!  Love it!  My mom is losing her hair after a major surgery and I have started her on it to make her hair appear fuller.</li>
    <li> Obsessed ! I love this dry shampoo, I have used almost every brand out there and nothing compares. I love the smell love the way my hair looks ! will not buy anything else!</li>
    <li> If anything, this made my hair look and feel even greasier than before. It turned the hair near the top of my head stringy and dark, making me look grosser than before. Maybe I just didn&#x27;t use enough, but I was scared to use any more after seeing how bad my hair looked after a few quick sprays...</li>
    <li> I have a tendency towards greasy roots but dry ends so I try wash my hair every other day.  This is the perfect product to use on the 2nd day to get rid of the oily roots.  I just spray at the roots and work it through with my fingers.  It also gives texture to clean hair if you need a little more &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; for up-do&#x27;s, etc.  Has a nice light scent.  The only negative - if you spray too close to your head or in only one spot, especially if you&#x27;re brunette it can leave a powdery white residue - I think this is true of most all dry shampoos.  I&#x27;ve found I can usually just brush that through, or my hair absorbs it.</li>
    <li> This product works great, though I don&#x27;t recommend using it more than one day in a row. It sort of coats your hair with powdery stuff to help it not look greasy, but if you touch your hair throughout the day, it easily comes off. If you reapply, it looks even more dirty. I suggest using this if you are going to have your hair in a fixed position and won&#x27;t be touching it a lot. I use it about once a month.</li>
    <li> Works great as a dry shampoo, but the fake citrus smell can be overpowering... From 6 blocks away. Even used sparingly, you&#x27;re going to smell like fake oranges.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different dry shampoo sprays from drug store to department store brands. By far, this is my favorite! It works well, smells good, and doesn&#x27;t leave that dreaded white residue like others do with just a bit of brushing. Plus, the price is fantastic! I even keep a back up stock of it :P</li>
    <li> I have tried many different brands of dry shampoo with all different price points, and this is the best one out there for the price!</li>
    <li> This scent is overwhelming and leaves white flakes in my hair.  Works in a pinch but wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for daily use</li>
    <li> This is the only Suave product I have ever found lacking.  It makes hair feel heavy and dirty- dirtier than it would have if I hadn&#x27;t used it at all! The smell is not bad but it&#x27;s way too strong.  It penetrates my nostrils until the next time I wash my hair. I just don&#x27;t want to even touch my hair when I use this stuff. I&#x27;m much better off with two-day-old hair! I will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> For me, this product has absolutely no redeeming value.  First of all, the smell is something I can&#x27;t even describe.  Worse than the smell itself was the fact that the smell lingered for a good 10 to 12 hours until I finally washed it.  Secondly, it did absolutely nothing that it was supposed to do.  My hair was every bit as greasy looking and feeling as it would have been had I not used the product.  It also gave me nothing in the way of volume.  I guess the only good thing, perhaps, is that it did not leave any white residue on my brown mixed with gray hair.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay much for it.</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo out there!!!</li>
    <li> This product does wonderful, unexpected things for your hair on a busy morning all the way to a hospital stay.</li>
    <li> The product does its job as a dry shampoo. It took away the shine from my second-day hair just fine. It also did not leave any residue one I brushed it.&lt;br /&gt;My complaint is the smell. I noticed that once it is on my hair it smells absolutely disgusting. It comes in two waves; The only way I can describe them is an initial faint lemony note, and a secondary attack of B.O.&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s not me or my hair because I&#x27;m very clean (shower beforehand), and I don&#x27;t notice the scent until after I spray on the product.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my mom and my sister, and they seem to have the same problem. The worst part is that it&#x27;s not just in our heads- we can all smell it off of each other! I wonder if this is just an abnormal reaction our hair has when it comes to this product, or if I got a bad one. I&#x27;ve certainly never had a problem with any other dry shampoo before, both expensive and cheap.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep looking for a good dry shampoo. In the meanwhile, I&#x27;ll be tossing this one!</li>
    <li> 1. Pros: It functions well as a dry shampoo in getting all the oil outta my roots. My hair is clearly more volumizing post-use&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#62; good for the price&lt;br /&gt;2. Cons: the white color! You have to hold the bottle at a certain distant away from your head, or else there will be gray/white spots on your roots. It&#x27;s bearable when I have time, but when I&#x27;m in a rush, I&#x27;d stay away from this knowing I will screw up and have no time to fix it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in short,&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#62; get this if you have plenty of time to get ready and prefer cheaper alternative&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#62; get something else, like the Garnier one, for a little bit more but no worries about white stain, and it smells good. Oh did I forget to mention the Suave one smells terrible? I always have to go in with some hair serum at the tip to overwhelm the Suave smell.</li>
    <li> I really like this dry shampoo. It has a pleasant smell, works really well and it is really affordable. The only down side is that it does leave your hair a bit white so if you have darker hair you have to be careful. I have medium-reddish-brown hair and I just spray the shampoo a little further away and then run my fingers through it to eliminate any whiteness. This method seems to work fine for me &amp; so I don&#x27;t end up looking like I have grey hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dry shampoo is great at eliminating grease &amp; buildup between washes. I also like to use it to build volume when I style my hair. It works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep purchasing this product through the Subscribe &amp; Save program as I go through them fairly quickly. :)</li>
    <li> This is the best dry shampoo spray on the market and it is the least expensive!  What a deal!  Make sure you don&#x27;t hold the bottle too close to your head or it will turn your hair white.  I have dark blonde hair and it is unnoticeable as long as you spray from the proper distance.  It also smells really good and provides volume.  I will totally admit that I use this spray when I don&#x27;t feel like washing my hair.  My hair gets oily pretty quick and this spray saves the day- it makes my hair look like it is freshly washed.  It&#x27;s also good for just a boost between day/evening activities.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a variety of dry shampoos in the last year and this is the one I like best -and it is the cheapest. The smell is great -fresh and clean but not cloying. It will turn your hair white but rub it in a little and it brushes out easily. I like the texture it gives my hair so much that I use it when I don&#x27;t strictly need it. A good value overall.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for a fantastic price!! It really works to help keep your style an extra one or two days. I subscribe to it so that I know I always have it on hand. If used properly and brushed after, it doesn&#x27;t leave white powder on your hair. The only thing I would change is the scent. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it&#x27;s just not pleasant.</li>
    <li> The dry shampoo from Sauve is cheap but of great quality.  I love using it and can feel like my hair was just washed in between washes.</li>
    <li> First time buying this product, but I have used several brands of dry shampoo. This product smells like pineapple and coconut. My husband, who is very scent sensitive to EVERY product I use, said it smelled, &amp;#34;Divine.&amp;#34; He has never liked the scent of ANY dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used, so this was a surprise! In comparison to Batiste spray, this product goes on much lighter and the scent does not last as long. I have brunette mid-back length hair and use dry shampoo to refresh 2nd day roots (and in 3rd day emergencies). I had to use considerably more product and hold the can considerably closer to my head while spraying to achieve the same results as I get with a very small amount of Batiste spray. Even with dark hair, you run a very low risk of getting that grey, dusty look with this product. However, I can see this product will run out more quickly than a similarly sized bottle of Batiste, since it takes so much more to achieve the same results. It smells better than any dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried, but the actual product is inferior to Batiste.</li>
    <li> After debating about which dry shampoo to try I decided to go with the Suave. I must say I am pretty impressed. The smell is so nice and not too strong. I would recommend having the shampoo a good bit away from your actual hairline and spray from further back, but I def feel it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or anything after using. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it</li>
    <li> Could not use this product more than once owing to the incredibly powerful, cloying fruit scent. Though this product helps mop up some oil, it left my fine hair weighed down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several &#x27;dry shampoos&#x27; and a lot are nearly &#x27;wet&#x27; or very smelly.  But THIS product is great!  BUT Suave has come out with a NEW dry shampoo which I do NOT like as it has something like Moroccan oil in it and it is so strong smell that I coughed for 10 minutes.  When I started looking in other stores for THIS Suave dry shampoo, I could no longer find it.  So, I got online and Amazon came through!  Yay!  I can now find my favorite dry shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have tried many dry shampoos and I have to say that for the price, this one is nearly as good as the designer brands. Come on, it&#x27;s like $3. This is ideal for light hair because it shows up a bit light, which I see could definitely be a problem for someone with darker locks.</li>
    <li> Smells so good and works really well. Good for Blonds. Still brush-able lasts a really long time. Highly recommend good stuff.</li>
    <li> This product works very well for absorbing excess oil from your roots. I found that a little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t overdo it. Start with a little and add more if you need it. Do not, however, expect it to make your hair look freshly washed. It will absorb the oil, but your hair will still look dull and flat. Normally, I hate scented products, but this smells pleasant and the smell doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Having a little toddler, I don&#x27;t always get to spend time on my hair like I used to. This stuff is my little miracle helper and it smells very pleasant. I will continue to buy this!</li>
    <li> I do not typically use drugstore brand cosmetics or hair products, but I insist this is the best dry shampoo out there.  I tried this a few years back and did like it, but thought that there had to be a better product out there.  I&#x27;ve since tried 10+ brands, anywhere from $5 to $40 each and have yet to find anything better than Suave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tons of long, dark, fine hair and this works well.  I just spray it in, enough so you can just see a faint white, leave it for 5 minutes, and then brush through it.  It eliminates oil very well and gives me volume, exactly what you expect in a dry shampoo. It does not leave a white residue in my hair like some brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think smell is great, not overpowering at all but it does last throughout the day, so it might bother some who are sensitive to perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part about it is that you can buy it anywhere, and it&#x27;s extremely inexpensive.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my wavy-to curly fine hair, but worked for my sister&#x27;s straighter hair.</li>
    <li> I have very oily hair and hate to wash it everyday. This stuff saves me! I can wash my hair monday and straighten it and then use this stuff on tuesday and my hair looks the exact same! My boyfriend even uses it sometimes when he&#x27;s in a rush to get out the door (he has oily hair like me). Did I mention that it smells great? Love it!</li>
    <li> I used this product daily for about 3 weeks. I have very coarse hair so I try not to wash it so much, as it can become dry if I do. However, it can occasionally look oily. My friend had some dry shampoo I used at her house sometimes, so I grabbed this because I thought it would be good to keep around for when my hair looks a bit oily between washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick, long hair. About a week ago, I started noticing some broken hairs at the top of my bangs and all over my head. Now my hair looks noticeably thinner, and I have little chunks of hair sticking up all over my head. All of it looks grossly brittle and my ends are split.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom is a beautician so I use top notch hair products, - my hair is kept very healthy. The only reason I grabbed this stuff was because she lives a few hrs away and when I saw it, I decided to get it instead of waiting until she could order me some through her salon. Never, has my hair done this. It looks unbelievably unhealthy. I can&#x27;t believe a short term use of this product has done such damage. I&#x27;m extremely angry and worried because I stopped using this about 5 days ago...and every day my hair looks worse and more broken and split. Just awful!</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time today.  I have never used a dry shampoo before but I have curly, mostly oily brunette hair so I was skeptical if I would like it.  Being in college I tend to not wake up in time for a full hair wash every day so I wanted something that would refresh my hair by the way it looks and smells.  For the price I thought this was a great deal I really like the smell, it didn&#x27;t make my hair color look funny, and it definitely helped some of the oiliness.  Totally recommended</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I have fine dark blonde hair that needs to be washed every day because it gets oily very quickly. It has saved me several times when I didn&#x27;t have time to wash my hair. I just spray it on my root area, let it sit for a minute or two, and then brush it out out with a natural bristle brush. It leaves my hair shiny and soft.  As a bonus, it also makes my hair appear fuller and gives it body.     Unlike some of the other reviewers, I do not particularly like the scent. I would prefer an unscented version, or at least a lighter scent. I have to give it five stars though because it is a very useful and easy to use product and it is very affordable.</li>
    <li> This product smells so good and works perfect! I will purchase this Suave Professionals Dry Shampoo from now on! :)</li>
    <li> I have pretty oily, fairly straight hair.  I tried this for the first time today and I can&#x27;t wait to shower.  It just feels heavy and gross, almost straw like.  I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Suave Professionals Dry Shampoo is NASTY! It made my hair much more oily then it was before I used it. Dont WASTE your money!</li>
    <li> My wife uses this product, if it is sprayed and i am within 20 feet of it, i literally (yes, i am using that word correctly) cannot breathe, the first time my wife used it, i felt like i was drowning, i eventually fell to the floor, on subsequent uses i tried to maintain my distance but still would go into a horrible coughing feet even when i was in an adjacent room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also makes my wifes hair both feel and smell wierd, although that could just be psychological conditioning on my part.  I don&#x27;t have any problems with hair spray or any other types of sprays, just this stuff, would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Better than other drugstore brands I&#x27;ve tried including hairspray brands I love like TRESemme and Schwartzkopf, and better than most high-end brands like Oscar Blandi, for a fraction of the price. The main ingredient is rice starch - same as Blandi and most other popular brands. Light lemongrass scent, superfine spray easy to work into scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noted that the most negative review was about the number of uses - I had the same experience with my first bottle, here&#x27;s the trick... Spray in SHORT BURSTS - not long ones. And shake the bottle before each use. I don&#x27;t really understand why, but this made a HUGE difference in the number of uses I got out of it. The first time, i think I got 4 or 5 uses... this time, I&#x27;ve gotten 10+ uses. Do not expect to get the same number of uses from any dry shampoo spray you get from hairspray - it&#x27;s apples-to-oranges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another tip: keep the focus on your part, and around the edges of your hairline on your face, plus a burst at the crown of your head. You shouldn&#x27;t need to cover everything - the oils are concentrated on your scalp, and using less, but taking the time to rub it in as soon as you spray means you use less each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BONUS: the scent.  I have had more people ask &amp;#34;What perfume are you wearing - I love it!&amp;#34; from the light lemongrass scent of this dry shampoo than any actual perfume I&#x27;ve ever worn!  It&#x27;s not noticeable once you spray it, but it seems like people get a whiff in close proximity...not so much that it interferes with my perfume, though.</li>
    <li> Price: Great.&lt;br /&gt;Smell: Awful, so strong. Smells like a 12-year old girl doused herself with something cheap from the drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness: Didn&#x27;t work for me at all. Hair still felt and looked greasy, except now it smelled terrible too. Also felt like it left a weird residue.&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Keep looking!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used any dry shampoo so I don&#x27;t know how well it works, but the smell is gross. Fake peachy/pineapple I can&#x27;t stand so I&#x27;ll be trying something else. If you do not like peach/pineapple scented candles you will not like this spray.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few dry shampoos and so far this is the best, but far far from perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- does not smell too strong.  I hate shampoos, wet or dry, that make me reek of perfume.  If I want perfume I&#x27;ll use real perfume.  Besides, fragrance mixes up with unwashed scalp&#x27;s odor and...yuck.  Till I finally find a scent-free dry shampoo, Suave will have to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- less powdery look.  It&#x27;s a dry shampoo, so it won&#x27;t be invisible.  But it definitely is less than others and when you shake or brush your hair most of it comes off.  I&#x27;m also lucky because I have blonde hair and the spray lightens it up, but I can see that it will be a problem on dark hair. I use my fingers mostly and then a natural brush.  As another reviewer said, make sure to put it on your roots only.  That&#x27;s where all the oil is, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This lasts me only a few hours, basically to go to work and come back and wash my hair.  It does feel very heavy and my scalp is a bit itchy, but once again, less so than other dry shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- it&#x27;s CHEAP! I got way more than 3 uses from it, and each use is a heavy one as I use a lot.  I prefer to spend $3 and change frequently, rather than buy an expensive product that may or may not work.  But that&#x27;s me.</li>
    <li> This is a complete waste of money and my time.  It didn&#x27;t work well at all.  It doesn&#x27;t brush out easily.  My hair felt dirtier after using it.  I sprayed it on 1 inch sections at the root and then waited a while for the powder to absorb the oil.  After quite a few minutes, the powder hadn&#x27;t absorbed at all so it was impossible to brush it out.  I was left with a matte powdered look so I had no choice but to do an updo and hope no one noticed the roots.  Maybe the secret is to do it the night before so the powder has plenty of time to absorb the oil.  In any case, the directions on the can are wrong.  There is some left in the can but I&#x27;ll throw it out anyway.  Batiste has the highest ratings on Amazon for a dry shampoo.  I have two cans of the original formula that I had forgotten about so next time I&#x27;ll try it.  Although this wasn&#x27;t expensive (I bought it on sale at the drugstore), it still was a complete waste of cash.</li>
    <li> For all the people on here saying that there isn&#x27;t enough in the bottle, and that they use about half of it within the first use: This product is for when you miss a shampooing and don&#x27;t have time to wash your hair. If your hair is THAT oily, that you have to use half the product in one use, then you should be taking a shower. It&#x27;s NOT intended for people who haven&#x27;t washed their hair in 3-5 days. It&#x27;s for a missed washing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, back on topic now....I love this product. It works great and removes the oil, while also giving my hair some volume.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best priced dry shampoo out on the market. I have blonde hair that gets greasy easily. This product works very well for me and seems to last for a while. It does leave you&#x27;re hair looking dull, but I&#x27;d take that anyday over greasy! My main complaint is that this product&#x27;s smell is way overpowering! It has a VERY STRONG pineapple scent that is just gross. I wish they made an unscented version.</li>
    <li> Smells great and seems to work when first used. Later, though, it makes my hair look greasy and stringy, as if I hadn&#x27;t washed it. I&#x27;d say that it doesn&#x27;t do the job if you have fine, thin hair like I do. Try TIGI Rockaholic. It&#x27;s pricey but it&#x27;s better than less expensive products...I&#x27;m done trying to find something cheaper.</li>
    <li> it is really nice and practical . I like it and it refresh my hair in the morning when I am in a rush and I must go to work in few minutes</li>
    <li> I am not in the habit of washing my hair daily, but sometimes I need a little something at the end of the day if I have plans. This is a very inexpensive solution. It adds a little volume and takes away the oiliness, just as expected. My only complaint is that I have very dark hair and if am too heavy handed it&#x27;s hard to blend in. I&#x27;ve found that (as with paint) two light coats is better than one heavy coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a fairly strong scent that lasts for hours as well, so if you don&#x27;t like scented products you might want to avoid this.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product because it&#x27;s so cheap, but the smell knocked me over and lingered for several hours.  Plus, I really didn&#x27;t see any more volume in my hair.</li>
    <li> The smell was so awful, all I could think about was getting home and washing this stuff out of my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what i needed.</li>
    <li> The aerosol will seep-out so try taking the spray head off and you&#x27;ll get a little bit longer use out of it. Otherwise, you&#x27;ll need to find a way to seal the actual spout...I used an eraser from an old pencil.  Or better yet, just get a couple cans of the  travel size, which has less pressure.</li>
    <li> I have fine, oily, dirty-blonde hair, and this stuff works wonders for me! It takes some practice to get the routine down, but once I figured out a routine for my hair, I have to stop myself from using it! After washing, my hair feels really baby-fine and thin, so adding a little volume with the Suave Pro Dry Shampoo helps a ton with styling. And, I like the texture a lot better than any hairspray or mousse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree, you don&#x27;t get much mileage out of a can. I can usually stretch one can to last about 2 weeks if I&#x27;m using the product every 2 or 3 days. And yeah, I wish it would last longer. But seriously, for the price, I don&#x27;t understand how anyone can complain! By hair product standards, this is dirt cheap! I&#x27;ve tried 4 other brands of dry shampoo including 2 &#x27;fancy&#x27; brands that cost TEN TIMES what this stuff does, but none do a better job than the Suave Pro. To compensate, I just make sure I buy 2 cans at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s different for everyone, but the scent of Suave Pro Dry Shampoo is SO much better than 3 of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried. 1 other brand used to give me tension headaches consistently, and 2 others made me want to gag. This has a citrus-ey smell that works for me. Sure, it&#x27;s no eau de toilette, but it&#x27;s perfectly fine and even a little pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had a complaint, it would be this: My husband &amp; I are known to take spontaneous mini-vacays to SoCal. On 2 occasions, I&#x27;ve *not* packed this dry shampoo thinking &#x27;I&#x27;ll just stop at a Target or WalMart when we get there to grab some.&#x27; Nope. On both occasions, I&#x27;ve checked multiple stores (big-box stores, grocery stores, drug stores, etc.) with zero luck. They&#x27;re always out of stock literally everywhere I check. So, I travel prepared now.</li>
    <li> This product is very good. it does the job. just dont spray it on your finger. it literally freezes to death. ];</li>
    <li> I bought some of this dry shampoo from another retailer a while back, but as an avid Amazon shopper who relies on reviews when making purchasing decisions, I wanted to submit one on this product.  First, I can&#x27;t compare Suave&#x27;s performance with a lot of dry shampoos, but I guess it does the trick okay, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any white residue in my dark brown hair.  But the smell is reaaaaally not my cup of tea.  Super-fruity--it makes me feel like I&#x27;ve poured a box of Capri-Sun over my head, so if smelling like fruit juice is your thing, go for it.  I&#x27;m just not a fruity gal, though--most fruit scents make me feel like I can&#x27;t wait to shower and get off the juice that has obviously created a sticky film over my body/head.  It&#x27;s a matter of personal preference, I realize, but just beware if you have a sniffer like mine.  I&#x27;ve tried it a few times, but it just has not grown on me and I&#x27;m seriously debating whether to throw away my can.</li>
    <li> I like it except when my hair is dark then you can sometimes see the white at my roots, I am going to see if it comes in other colors for darker hair</li>
    <li> I really like it - for how cheap it is, it definitely works quite well. It works best if you use it with a flat iron (the heat helps activate the effect). This allows me to go a day in between washings and definitely gives my hair a lot of volume!</li>
    <li> I like it! It&#x27;s perfect for the day after washing your hair when oil starts to show on the roots. I spray a little bit only on the crown of my head, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend spraying it all over, brush my fingers thru it to get rid of the white powdery stuff and voila! I also like the volume it gives. It has a light scent to it.</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo is so great!!!  I have really oily hair, it can be so bad it starts to look oily in less than 24 hours.  I also have really light blond highlights, so once it starts getting greasy.  I know that washing my hair everyday is not great for my hair or the investment in my hair color, but it has been really hard not to wash my hair everyday because of how oily my hair gets. I use Argan Oil shampoo and conditioner to help the health of my hair, but still do not want wash my hair everyday.      Since I&#x27;m more of a bargin shopper and like to spend little money as possible when experimenting, I bought this Suave Professionals Dry Shampoo and couldn&#x27;t believe how great it is.  I can not only skip one day shampooing, but also two days if I want. Not only does it keep my hair from getting oily, but it also adds lots of volume to my very fine hair and has a great scent. If I do choose to go a second day without washing, I usually pull my hair back.</li>
    <li> I will always have a bottle of this stuff at work.  It makes my hair fluffy, it smells ok, and it works in a pinch.</li>
    <li> I have extremely fine hair that has to be washed daily, on summer days I look like a grease ball by time 3pm hits. I&#x27;ve been hearing more and more about Dry Shampoo so I decided to give Suave a chance. I hate shelling out money for a product I&#x27;m not sure will work for my hair; so the price was the deciding factor. At first I was pretty excited! I used a little on my roots and bangs in the morning and by 3pm my bangs were a little dirty but NO WHERE near as bad as they normally are! I was digging it! I used the can a total of THREE times on my part/bangs before it emptied. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. With the few baby sprays I used the entire 5 ounces were gone! I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the seals on the spray or what but I was extremely disappointed.  I should also add that this has a very grandma-equse scent to it. Strong and perfumey. I wasn&#x27;t a fan.</li>
    <li> I saw this as Walmart for under $3 which is a great price for a good working dry shampoo. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with this. I spray it into my roots and then kind of massage it in with my fingers, then I spray 8-10 inches away a sweep over my entire head and then I brush it through. If you use too much it will be white/gray and you will have to work it in. The bottle says if the nozzle clogs rinse in warm water. I&#x27;m not sure if thats the problem that people are having. I&#x27;ve used it probably 5-7 times and the bottle feels nearly full. I actually like the smell, but thats just a matter of personal preference I guess. Overall, for the price I really like this product and will be purchasing it again. It definitely allows you to skip a shampoo or two!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using dry shampoos for a while now in between washes to keep my color longer and have used a bunch of different kinds. I ran out of the kind I normally use and ran to the store to pick up one to used before I could order more of my preferred kind. I just grabbed this one because it was cheap. Well it was HORRIBLE! the smell is really gross to me, it&#x27;s supposed to smell like citrus, but it just smells gross to me. With a dry shampoo I don&#x27;t really want a smell just something that removed oil and other dirt. I can get over the smell if it works good, but this one doesnt. I used it how I use other dry shampoos and it just made my hair look grosser than it did before. So I had to wash it. Then the next time I thought \\&quot;maybe I need to use it the way they direct you to use it\\&quot; and did that, and had the same results. I ended up throwing the can out. I was hoping I found a less expensive alternative to the more expensive brands I normally use, but I guess in the instance you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This is a great dry shampoo but whenever I spray it inside, I feel like the powderyness of the smell is lining my airways with powder.  I have to use it outside but since I don&#x27;t have to use it that often, that&#x27;s not so bad for me. Other than that, I like the way it works.</li>
    <li> If my bangs need a little freshening up I use this product, but otherwise I am not a fan.  The scent is overwhelming, and not terribly pleasant. And it leaves my hair feeling odd, like it is wiry and residue-y</li>
    <li> I have a very long hair that comes down close enough to my waist.&lt;br /&gt;Although I know I am not supposed to, I washed my hair every morning to keep it oil free (and less smelly).&lt;br /&gt;The more I washed my hair, the more it produced oil to keep my hair healthy.&lt;br /&gt;Then, I came up to this product.&lt;br /&gt;Good price, easy to use, and actually works!&lt;br /&gt;I spray this to the roots of my hair and the fine powder sits on my hair and absorb the oil.&lt;br /&gt;On day 1, I wash my hair with shampoo and water. day 2, dry shampoo. day 3, dry shampoo. Then, I go back to day 1.&lt;br /&gt;Now my hair is producing less oil, smells and looks nice everyday.&lt;br /&gt;And there are a lot in one spray bottle. I started using the first bottle about a month ago, and I&#x27;m still on the first bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Such a good deal for great quality hair product. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I was worried about it not lasting more than a few uses, after reading other reviews, but I only use this product on my roots and it lasted quite a while. I was using it every other day for maybe 2 months. Works great. Smells great.</li>
    <li> Since I have dramatically and unnaturally colored hair and can only wash it two or three times a week, I go through a lot of dry shampoo. After switching back and forth through many of them, this one is my least favorite. While it works decently, it smells awful. The scent is almost citrus-y--but not in a good way! I wouldn&#x27;t care so much if the smell dissipated, but it doesn&#x27;t. Your hair continues to smell like orange-scented-butthole through the rest of the night/day. Works well on soaking up the oils, though. [:</li>
    <li> I used Pssst dry shampoo for a while, really liked it.  I saw this on amazon, it was inexpensive--but had some mixed reviews.  First of all, the reviews that say this only lasts one time-how much are you using? You only need to spray your roots while holding the can 4-6 inches from your head.  Works like a charm.  This stuff smells great too (I repeat myself, if you don&#x27;t use too much).  So basically, if you have used dry shampoo before, and are confident in your dry shampoo abilities this is an awesome product.  I will definitely buy again, does the job and smells great too!</li>
    <li> Ok, I tried Treseme dry shampoo, BUST.  This is is the best pice out there.  It also extends the life of my hair for a few more days.  I use it 2 to 3 times between washes.  I think it does a great job!  My only complaint is that it makes my hair dull and shows up kind of white in my red hair.  I can live with that cuz it gives me a lot of extra volume that my heavy, thick hair usually pulls down when I don&#x27;t use this product!  I have not experienced the 2-uses-and-done thing.  I usually get 20 uses out of a can...</li>
    <li> This is the best dry shampoo on the market, works great, smells divine and so inexpensive! I have brownish/blondish hair, the product sprays out white powder so my hair looks lighter in color at first but that seems to go away once I style it. I have curly hair but it works great. Try this, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> Contrary to other people&#x27;s posts about this product, I absolutely love it! I have used several different brands of dry shampoo that are far more expensive and don&#x27;t work as good, or just as good but with about a $15 price mark up.  This product smells great and absorbs all the oil in my hair, I have very oily hair and I don&#x27;t want to have to wash my hair every day so this product saves me time &amp; money! I also have fine/thin hair that doesn&#x27;t hold volume at all, this dry shampoo helps my hair have more volume as well! I&#x27;ve had other dry shampoos that make my hair feel sticky and clumpy, I haven&#x27;t had any of these issues with this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that a few other reviewers said that this product runs out fast.  I can say I&#x27;ve been using this dry shampoo for a couple of weeks now and I&#x27;ve definitely used it more than twice and I still have plenty product in the bottle.  I do know that some people need to use more than others to get the volume and effect they want... but I don&#x27;t know maybe they have had faulty bottles.  However, if I have the issue of this product running out fast, I&#x27;ll keep you guys updated... but so far so good!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to dry shampoo.  I have been through a whole bottle of Dove dry shampoo, which I LOVE! I picked this up from dollar general because I didn&#x27;t feel like driving to Walmart to pick up the dove.  I can not stand this dry shampoo it&#x27;s horrible!! It does some what take away the greasy look but still leaves hair, as another reviewer said, with a greasy, limp look. That defeats the purpose, it&#x27;s suppose to renew your hair!! It&#x27;s incredibly drying and makes my long, curly hair unmanageable, even only spraying at the roots.  Skip this and try the dove brand. It&#x27;s a little more but worth it.</li>
    <li> I was paying $18 for dry shampoo before, and it maybe smelled a little bit better - but you can&#x27;t really beat the price on this. For me, it works just as well as the salon stuff, and I don&#x27;t feel bad about using it on freshly washed hair to add volume.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff but the smell is sort of overpowering. It is like spraying air freshener in my hair. Other than that, it does smell good.</li>
    <li> Takes the oil right out!! Perfect for mornings when you wake up late with oily hair. Ive had it for a month and its saved me so many times!I love it!</li>
    <li> I have very fine straight hair that tends to get oily quickly. I have tried many a dry shampoo and this is by far my favorite. It is very effective at bringing hair back to life, and unlike most other dry shampoos this one has a great smell. I highly recommend it, and at this reasonable price, what do you have to lose?</li>
    <li> I have tried other dry shampoos with varying degrees of success. Unfortunately this one was not successful at all. It smelled so strong, I was tempted to use it outside, so I didn&#x27;t make everyone in the house pass out from the fumes. (FYI, no one did pass out) This product, after applying and waiting and then brushing out, made my hair look worse. It had a somewhat heavy and almost sticky build up, even after brushing out. It made my hair feel and look dirty. I will not be purchasing this product in the future.</li>
    <li> Dry shampoo is my go-to as a busy professional (and getting more use now that I have an infant).  This dry shampoo is a great value and works really well - one of the best I&#x27;ve tried.  It has a really pleasant grapefruit scent, which I find refreshing but not overpowering or perfum-y.  My usual brand is BedHead&#x27;s Dirty Secret, but after too many struggles with leaky products, I gave up on it.  I&#x27;ve tried Oscar Blandini - didn&#x27;t do anything much to soak up oil/recondition my hair for another day and was really expensive.  BedHead replaced their last leaky bottle with a TIGI Catwalk product that smelled SO AWFUL that (1) even my husband commented on it both times I used it (2) I was distracted at work all day b/c I kept \\&quot;smelling something\\&quot; and finally (3) I threw the full product away b/c it was disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;I have medium brown hair and do not have issues with this product leaving white residue.  This has been a problem for me with some of the other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I recommend that you buy 2 bottles, save $ over other dry shampoos, and get out the door faster in the morning!</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair feel fuller, along with postponing having to wash it.  It perks the hair up, it looks clean, full and nice.  I will always keep some of this product with me...love it.</li>
    <li> great for synthetic wigs &amp; extensions too- it dulls the &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; &amp; makes the hair look like human hair. I always keep several cans on hand, plus this can be used on days when u cannot shampoo or after surgery etc.</li>
    <li> This stuff does the trick. I always tried to ration out my Batiste Dry Shampoo, but at this price I can spray till my hearts content....which is easy to do because I am in love with the fruity scent on this product. I have black hair, and this does a decent job of blending in and not looking chalky.</li>
    <li> I have purchased many dry shampoos, and overall even though you may not get as many uses this is better performance for much lower price than many out there. I think the next best drugstore brand would be dove, and it seems to have a few more uses per can. However it costs nearly twice as much.</li>
    <li> I have tried EVERY dry shampoo out there, from cheap to expensive, and this is by far my favorite.  I buy several at a time because I can&#x27;t always find it in stores near me.</li>
    <li> i love how this product gives a nice clean look. the only problem i have is the smell. i guess its not horrible but i think it should be better. any way it leaves my hair clean and beautiful.</li>
    <li> I have tried every moderately priced dry shampoo on the market from L&#x27;oreal to Pantene to Herbal Essence and everything in between.  I&#x27;ve also tried a lot of more expensive &#x27;designer&#x27; brands.  My favorite is a brand called Ojon but it&#x27;s way too expensive - especially at the rate I use this stuff.  I will buy it to take on a special trip or occasion but not for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely fine hair and oily skin - which means that about 20 minutes after a beautiful blowout, my hair is weighed down a greasy.  I&#x27;ve tried every volumizing and clarifying shampoo on the market with no change in the way my hair (at the roots) just sops up the oil and leaves me with stringy lifeless hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price listed here was a bit more than I typically pay. Walmart and Target typically sell this for about $2.50 - $3.50, but rarely have it in stock anymore.  CVS and Walgreens use to sell it, as well as some grocery stores, but they have recently stopped.  The recent lack of availability of this product has scared me so whenever I find it for a good price, I buy the whole lot.  I use about 1 of these in a week (sometimes a bit more).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it right after I blow dry in the morning and again just lightly before bed.  It&#x27;s best to use it before you get oily - as a prevention.  Otherwise, if you just spray it on the oily area, it creates a bit of residue and can take a while to work out.  Plus, it just doesn&#x27;t ever look as clean after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned, I have extremely fine, flat hair which is a dirty blond color so when it gets oily it just looks dirty minus the blonde.  This keeps my color fresh and gives me great volume.  I usually don&#x27;t skip a day shampooing (with real shampoo and water) because my hair just gets too weighed down by then.  In order to keep soaking up that kind of oil, I would need to use a ton of this stuff which in turn starts to dry out my ends - so the result is frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a different hair type than fine and oily, this product is likely to work differently for me than it does for you.  The important thing is to find something that works for and/or is recommended for your hair type.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a life saver on days when I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair.  I have pretty fine hair and don&#x27;t like washing it every day either because it gets so dried out blowing it dry and straitening afterwards.  A helpful tip, hold it fairly far away from your head and massage it through your hair so it doesn&#x27;t end up white.</li>
    <li> As the headline states. I can&#x27;t stand the scent of this variety of Suave dry shampoo.  It is very overpowering. All day I kept wondering \\&quot;What is that scent?!\\&quot;  I only used the product in small bursts on the crown of my head. Whoa, is that perfume strong!!!! I do recommend the Suave Keratin variety of this product. Much more subtle.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. I prefer the Blow better. This has a strong odor and definitely makes your hair feel funky. Blow is just the powder and really doesn&#x27;t affect your hair&#x27;s texture, just gets rid of the oil</li>
    <li> I had read some good things about the Suave dry shampoo in a magazine so I decided to give it a try, but it was very dissapointing.  It really didnt seem to help at all in making hair look less oily, and it also left a very heavy residue - almost like I had taken a fire extinguiser to the head and made my hair feel rough and tangly. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> After reading all of the negative reviews, I am a bit shocked to see so many complain about the amt of product in the bottle.  I have rear-end length hair that is oily and I do not shampoo every day.  I finally had to go to a new bottle after 3-4 months of use.  If you don&#x27;t shower in the the stuff, you get great use out of it.  The trick to it is using it AFTER you style your hair and it absorbs the oily parts.  Your ends never get oily, so there is no point in going past the top of your hair.  Pull it back, style it, or whatever you do, THEN apply it.  Let it get a grey/white film, let it sit, and then smooth through.  The heat of your hands with absorb it into your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you need to hold your breath, the smell is nice, but STRONG at first.  Another comment I read is that it leaves a heavy feeling and it does, but if you brush it out at night, you don&#x27;t have that problem as bad.</li>
    <li> This works pretty well on my very long, very straight and not-very-oily hair.  I don&#x27;t use it on a daily or even weekly basis, but if for some reason I want to freshen up my hair after the gym without having to wash and blow dry, or want to stretch washing time by a day, this works nicely.  It leaves a very nice, full bodied and non-greasy look, although I think my hair is a bit less glossy with this in it, and I really don&#x27;t think I would use this for more than one day without a real wash, since it gives a bit of a &#x27;product residue&#x27; feeling to my roots which I think would get worse if I layered it on over 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me the scent is reasonably pleasant, if somewhat strong at first and a little strange.  I think it smells a little &#x27;childish&#x27;- very fruity and sweet, but my fiance seems to love it; he always comments on how nice and clean I smell when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does leave a slight greyish cast in my dark hair if I use a lot, but a little seems to go a long way, and I do best just spraying my part and around my face &amp; ears lightly, then rubbing in and brushing.  I think I&#x27;ve used my bottle 10-ish times and it seems to be getting rather light like it&#x27;s nearly gone.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this actually works! It smells really nice too. Absorbs oil, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue and is a new favorite! Great price too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many kinds, ranging in price from $4-$10 per bottle. This is by far my favorite and also the cheapest (combined with prime shipping for extra benefit). The smell is very pleasant and it leaves hair leaving light and fresh, doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. Not sure why this shampoo is getting so many negative reviews. I&#x27;ve used it at least 10 times, and the bottle isn&#x27;t even half empty. For the price, you really can&#x27;t go wrong, I would recommend trying this to anyone, even if you don&#x27;t like, it will only set you back about $3.</li>
    <li> better than more expensive dry hair shampoos I have bought and nice clean scent!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair look clean gives it the right picke up for those days that it is needed I love it so much it&#x27;s on auto ship</li>
    <li> I think this stuff works really well. I was a little concerned when I read that people were only getting 1-3 uses out of a can. I decided to give it a try anyway. These cans have lasted me a while. I don&#x27;t know how much some people are spraying on their hair, but if I only got one use out of one of these cans, then it would mean that I hadn&#x27;t showered in weeks and have some extremely greasy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need it for a touch up on some days, it works great. Provides a lot of volume for me, so if you don&#x27;t want any more volume, it might not be very beneficial for you. I like this product though. I&#x27;d definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I tried this on a wavy hair day and rubbed it in with my fingers. I have blonde hair so I didnt see any residue or anything but it did not do anything for me at all EXCEPT add this disgusting strong scent that I could smell for hours which made me nauseous!! YUCK! It wouldnt have been that bad if it hadnt been so strong. When I first sprayed it on it felt more like I was using hairspray and it literally did nothing for my greasy roots. Took it back.</li>
    <li> I just used this again this morning - I&#x27;m loving the smell, the ease of application, and how well it works!  I&#x27;ve used dry shampoos in the past that were astronomically priced (I&#x27;m looking at you, B&amp;B), and this is a great, low cost option!  I will definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> As my hair is on show on a constant basis i needed to find something that would help keep my hair looking and smelling fresh in between washes. I have tried other brands and did not find that they helped at all, in fact they made my hair feel greasy and dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went out on a whim and purchased this brand and only after using it a couple times, loved it so much went to &#x27;subscribe and save&#x27; the product so that i would have a continuous supply and never run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product smells great not overpowering and still makes my hair feel and smell fresh. The product works great! Yes like more dry shampoos it does leave a white residue, however if you spray the product and rub it in with your hands then take a comb and brush it through slightly the white residue disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price Great product what else can i say, i try it! :)</li>
    <li> This does smell pretty nice. It gives your hair that last bit of life before you must wash it again. HOWEVER; it doesn&#x27;t do the \\&quot;oil-hide-a-way\\&quot; job like a little baby powder. 8-)</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B004DBUAGQ Suave Professionals Dry Shampoo Spray, Beautiful Clean, 5 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely adore this product! It is a lifesaver for those of us not born with beautifully thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;I spray it on freshly shampooed and dried hair and Wa-La! Volume PLUS! Oh, and it is great between shampoos as well.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is fantastic,too.&lt;br /&gt;I suppose the only downside is the residue it leaves behind. Kind of powdery. My hair is mostly blonde so it is not as noticeable but it may be a problem&lt;br /&gt;for those with dark hair. Don&#x27;t try to get more than one use in between shampoos because it will dull your hair a bit. A lot, actually.&lt;br /&gt;I love it though and give it two \\&quot;Woots\\&quot; (or five stars)!</li>
    <li> Great for keeping oil away. It makes it so that I can wear my hair down two days in a row.  The scent is a bit strong for my taste though.</li>
    <li> This works so well, absorbing oils and keeping my hair so fresh and clean looking.  I will buy it again.  Much cheaper than other brands on the market.  Super fast shipping too.</li>
    <li> I always need dry shampoo since I like to keep my hair natural for a longer period of time. Works good, just won&#x27;t hold clean for two days.</li>
    <li> I bought this on the strength of other reviews.  The good news is that it does what it says.  I have medium fine hair that gets oily at the scalp and dry at the ends the day after I wash it.  Not having to wash it every morning is a plus for many reasons.  1) saves time in the morning 2) saves wear and tear on the ends and 3) helps preserve my temporary color longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the bad news...the scent is overpowering.  To my nose it smells like a chemical version of overripe bananas and mangoes that have been spoiling in a small, airtight Volkswagen for a week.  The smell is so overpowering I was worried it was going to make my cat keel over!  My husband said it smells like dryer sheets to him.  I do not agree.  I actually like the smell of most dryer sheets.  I would LOVE this product if it smelled like Method dryer sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I only bought one of these to try it out before going hog-wild because this is such a great deal (I paid $2.50 or so).  I also bought one bottle of Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Dry Shampoo, 5 Ounce which I must say has a much more bearable scent.  Still strong, but more like a shampoo or hairspray smell than a rotten fruit smell.  In fact, I would buy this one again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend either product for a person who has allergies, scent induced migraines, chemical sensitivities, or a partner with allergies, scent induced migraines, chemical sensitivities....</li>
    <li> Works just as well as the Oscar Blandi product at a fraction of the price!  Absorbs oil nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave any whiteness in my medium brown hair (if following directions of gently rubbing with palm).  It does feel a bit thick to the hand where I&#x27;ve been heavy with the application...not gritty...but as if the individual strands of hair are thicker than normal.  It doens&#x27;t look odd or noticeable though.  I&#x27;ll continue to buy this product!</li>
    <li> i does make your hair look a little less oily, but not very much. this product makes my scalp very itchy, this was my main problem with this dry shampoo</li>
    <li> Hair falls out. Beware! If you use this, over a period of time, hair falls out and you get bald patches. Now I&#x27;ve got to spend lots of money on hair regrowth treatments and wait many months for the hair to come back. One star is more like it.</li>
    <li> All and all I will buy this product again. It worked pretty good for when my hair felt oily. good price good product.</li>
    <li> Shake up can, spray onto hair.  Result was good smell, matte powdery finish left in hair, yikes! If your Blonde it might be ok.  My worth while splurge is now going back one that worked. Bio silk revive dry clean shampoo is great for light touch up&#x27;s for hair that needs freshening up not a product to soak up lots of excess oil though, super fresh smell and no powdery residual in dark hair.</li>
    <li> I was a doubter but we are not on our 3rd can of this time-saving hair helper! Try it! It also smells delicious and my husband uses it too.</li>
    <li> This is a good product if you are looking for something to freshen up your hair.  Sprays on nice and combs out easy.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo for days when I&#x27;m in a rush but feel icky if I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair. I did not buy until I&#x27;d read all the reviews of this and several other dry shampoos.  Today I was running late for work and decided to give it a go.  I showered but ignored my hair and instead opted to grab the dry shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Thought I perfectly followed the directions, instead of a light, healthy head I instead looked like someone dumped flour on my head! I couldn&#x27;t brush it out or rub it in per the instructions which lead to ANOTHER shower just to wash this out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Terrible waste of my time and money.</li>
    <li> If I wash my hair in the morning, by the next morning, I&#x27;m a grease ball.  If I wash my hair the night before, by the next morning, I&#x27;m a grease ball.  I have tried another Suave dry shampoo (I think Keratin something) and it didn&#x27;t work.  I gave it away.  BUT I have learned the trick to using dry shampoo.  Spray it on the night before, not the next morning.  Use it kind of like you would deoderant.  You want it to prevent oil, not try to sop it up the next day.  This has worked great for me.  I&#x27;ve been able to wash my hair every other day doing it this way.  I still spray a little in the morning just to make myself feel better, but I&#x27;ve not been oily at all.  I might get crazy and try going for three days.  This does have a strong fruity smell in the beginning, but it dies down and you hardly smell it as much the next day.  If you&#x27;re wanting to experiment with dry shampoos, I would recommend trying this one.  You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I have a regular brand of dry shampoo that I use, but I saw this one at Wal-Mart and it was cheap so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Bad. Just bad. It made my hair feel weird and not look good. In fact, I don&#x27;t even think it worked well at all. I ended up returning it and getting my $3 back. If you all want a fabulous spray, that works like magic and is awesome- try Umberto of Beverly Hills dry shampoo which is sold at Target. I&#x27;ll never stray again.</li>
    <li> its good product for blonde straight hair. Im blonde but my hair is curly, so the shampoo makes it  straight</li>
    <li> I like the product and smell wise it doesn&#x27;t bother me but it leaves this aerosol film in the bathroom that chokes my son out.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome, works better than the spendy stuff I have purchased in the past! I can go three days without washing my hair with this stuff, and in the past not even a full day before I thought I should have more in my hair!&lt;br /&gt;PERFECT!</li>
    <li> Its a quick hair wash and it smells amazing. Also leaves it with volume and bouncy. Its great for the price</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ll start with the positive:&lt;br /&gt;~ When I used this product, it got my hair from filthy-looking to decent-looking. Key purpose accomplished.&lt;br /&gt;~ I liked the smell of it, too - kind of tropical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And on to the negative:&lt;br /&gt;~ The worst part is that \\&quot;when I used this product\\&quot; was 3 times before it ran out,  and the last time it sort of spat on my hair so I had trouble working the powder through.&lt;br /&gt;~ It makes your hair feel like it has a lot of hairspray in it, which I&#x27;m not used to at all. The second time, I managed to brush it enough that I could wear my hair loose, whereas the first time, it wouldn&#x27;t move properly. You definitely need a good bristle brush, and to start out with your hair detangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The verdict:&lt;br /&gt;~ I may buy it again, but I would make a point of trying not to need it. It&#x27;s really a waste of money to use it regularly.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I would do without this dry shampoo, actually I guess I do, I would be hand washing my bangs in the sink. I use this spray on my bangs almost everyday that I running from activity to activity. Towards the end of a day of running around my bangs will separate due to my oils on my forehead and I like to refer to this as the piano bangs effect. This is a quality dry shampoo for the price. The smell is fresh and nice and combs out just the way it is supposed to without any residue like other dry shampoos leave on your scalp.</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine, so I&#x27;ve always had issues with my hair being oily, and having to wash it every single day.  Suave Dry Shampoo is wonderful!  I just spray it on my roots, usually in the evening after my hair has started to get a little oily, and it gives my hair volume like I just washed and blow-dried it.  The perfume scent is a little strong, but you won&#x27;t be self-conscious about having that dirty scalp smell!</li>
    <li> There is no better dry shampoo! I have tried them all. This is so inexpensive it&#x27;s hard to believe,but it is by far the best.</li>
    <li> I have blond fine hair and have tried a ton of different dry shampoos from PSST to very expensive professional ones. This one without question is my absolute favorite. It works extremely well and has a very pleasant light lemon scent. It is the first one I used where my husband didn&#x27;t complain about the smell. Like with any dry shampoo they can leave your hair looking a bit dull - so I just put on some shine spray (I like Kenra because it is not a pump with oil) and I am good to go. My hair is oily and this product allows me to skip a few days a week when I am in a rush.</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found. I have thin blonde hair and it revives my (greasy after 10 hours) hair like nothing I&#x27;ve ever used before. And it smells great-- kind of citrus-y instead of the common baby powder smell.</li>
    <li> Great dry shampoo at a great cost. It has a slight citrus-y smell but I don&#x27;t mind. In fact I quite like it. If you spray it too close to your head you can get some white powder-like residue in your roots but I think that applies to all dry shampoos. Does its job quite well, I would say.</li>
    <li> This is more like a hairspray with talc in it. It made my hair sticky, took the natural shine out of it and although it took the greasiness away , my hair just looked dirty.&lt;br /&gt;The Suave Keratin Infusiondry shampoo is much better.</li>
    <li> When I turned 13, all of the sudden my hair started getting oily every day. I can&#x27;t wash my hair everyday because then it dries out (I have weird hair). When I purchased this I was shocked at how well it worked. You just brush it through your hair and VOILA...it&#x27;s not oily anymore! My only criticism is that it should come in a darker color (I have dark brown hair and the white sometimes leaves spots) and it leaves your hair feeling kind of fake. However, if you apply this the night before you want it to work, the feeling goes away. BEST PRODUCT EVER!!! IT SAVES MY LIFE :)</li>
    <li> I have oily hair and I hate washing it everyday because then the rest is dry and my roots are oily! So I bought this hoping for a different solution. However, it made my hair look even more greasy and didn&#x27;t help at all, had to wash it after all. Could be the oils in my hair but unfortunately this product didn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
    <li> Because of this product I am able to wash my hair every other night!&lt;br /&gt;It saves me so much time getting ready in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;It smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave a powder residue on the hair.</li>
    <li> This would be a great product except for one thing: it stinks! It&#x27;s hard to even describe what it smells like. Industrial. Like what many unscented products wind up smelling like, because there is no such thing as something that actually has no smell (well, rarely). So this has a very bitter, chemical scent. I don&#x27;t detect any organic kinds of smells at all--no fruity/citrusy/flowery/musky tones whatsoever. More like burning rubber or accelerant. Too bad.</li>
    <li> I use this almost everyday. I have super fine hair that gets oily the next day without washing it. This dry shampoo lets me go a few extra days without having to wash it and it smells amazing!! Love it. Won&#x27;t ever stop buying it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff! With work, school, and a toddler, it&#x27;s rare that I have a chance for any &amp;#34;me&amp;#34; time (and yes, sometimes, this includes washing my hair). Just one spray and it looks clean all day! I have oily hair unless I wash it every day, so it&#x27;s nice that I can skip this step when necessary, but still appear to my coworkers, classmates, and family as someone with the utmost attention to hygiene. I&#x27;ve also noticed that I can tint my hair lighter by using this spray when my hair is so fresh and so clean. This is really an awesome backup plan for anyone with a hectic schedule.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- It works incredibly well! With a couple reapplications, this lasted me 3 days and 2 workouts. I could have kept going.&lt;br /&gt;- The price is unbeatable.&lt;br /&gt;- It evens smells good.&lt;br /&gt;- It isn&#x27;t sticky.&lt;br /&gt;- It adds volume, and good texture for intricate hairstyles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It can make your hair slightly stiff...&lt;br /&gt;- While spraying it, it&#x27;s slightly suffocating.&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;m a blonde, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me, but on brunettes, the white powder would require more rubbing in.&lt;br /&gt;- However, I do notice that it makes my hair look less shiny. More dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;- Don&#x27;t wait until your hair is oily to apply it. It&#x27;s meant to absorb the oil as your scalp secretes it. It&#x27;s most effective if applied the same day as you wash your hair. I usually put it in about mid-day (before working out), or at least before bed, if I know I can&#x27;t wash it the next day.&lt;br /&gt;- Spray it from 8-12 inches away. Otherwise, it&#x27;s slightly thick and sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> For an inexpensive product this really works great.  I bought one for each of my sisters and my mother too!  Great to use before curling to add texture to fine hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Some dry shampoos cause my hair to have a strange texture that drives me crazy. This one doesn&#x27;t. It also smells fresh. If Suave had a dry shampoo product specifically for brunettes, I would be even more pleased.</li>
    <li> I juat picked up a bottle of this from walmart (same price) -- I have super fine thin straight hair that shows grease/oil soooo easily - basically I can wash my hair at night, go to sleep, and it will look dirty in the morning. I swear I think this stuff is about to revolutionize my hair routine!!    I watched a bunch of youtube videos because I just dyed my hair red and needed to find some dry shampoo because red fades too fast to wash it everyday and everyone was raving about this one and that it was just as good as $20 bottles for a couple bucks. It&#x27;s awesome. I never have volume and not only did it make my hair look clean, it gave me volume!~ I&#x27;m gonna be using this stuff everyday from here on out~</li>
    <li> Walmart sells thus for $2.88 . It&#x27;s great !!! Easy to use, and will be buying  again. !! I&#x27;m a hairdresser and this is better then some professional stuff !!! If your on the fence , buy it !!!!</li>
    <li> A common issue with aerosal dry shampoos are that they tend to leak which means you can only use it 2-3times if you&#x27;re lucky. Luckily I was aware of this after buying a can of Dove dry shampoo which was a huge dissapointment because the Dove dry shampoo smells much nicer and seems to work alot better with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to use up the suave bottles by removing the nozzle after each use. When I used it up I decided that the smell was becomming a headache so now I just use baby cornstarch inbetween washes</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really solve the purpose as i thought it would. My hair still reamains oily. Maybe right when i spray it it fluffs up but its flat again in a matter of minutes. I would maybe think of trying some other brand</li>
    <li> i love this stuff.  i&#x27;ve used it for about a year now and it&#x27;s great.  when my hair is just on the border of need washed, i use this stuff and it&#x27;s fantastic.  my hair looks great when i use it and it smells great.  i really LOVE this product.</li>
    <li> I have hair extensions, so when I get them moved around (taken out and put back in on different strands of my own hair) I can&#x27;t wash my hair for 2 days. For someone with super-oily skin - and thus hair - that can be a real problem. I typically use Batiste dry shampoo colored for blonde hair, but it&#x27;s a bit more expensive and I was looking to find a cheaper one that I could use to keep the oil at bay between everyday washings. (I need to use it every evening to absorb extra oil because the oil will destroy the bonds of the extensions.) I tried the Dove version and hated it, plus there is a problem with the valve leaking - you get about 3 uses and it&#x27;s done. Then I tried Suave and feel that I landed on a good, inexpensive product. Some reviewers complained about the smell, but to me it&#x27;s fairly pleasant and slightly lemony/citrusy. Different body chemistries do react to fragrances differently, so I can understand that the aroma might not be compatible with every person...it&#x27;s okay for me, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that NO dry shampoo will make your hair look like it&#x27;s just been washed. The purpose of them is to absorb oil and freshen your hair enough to get by between washings. This product does just that, so I&#x27;m pretty happy with it for the price. I still use the Batiste in the morning if I can&#x27;t wash my hair, but in between I use the Suave to take away the oil so I don&#x27;t have extensions falling out all over the place.</li>
    <li> I recently chopped off about 6\\&quot; of hair to give my hair a much needed health boost.  I got incredible volume for my fine hair, but after a day of not washing, I had greasy roots. Being blonde, it was too noticeable not to wash.  I started my search for a dry shampoo to get me thru the in-between days of hair washing.  I found Sauve at my local store and figured at this price, it&#x27;s worth a shot.  It AMAZED me!  I couldn&#x27;t believe the volume I got and the greasy root look was instantly gone.  I started to wonder \\&quot;how long is this gonna last?\\&quot;  The first time I did it, I went 3 days between washing.  Then I started to notice the build up of the dry shampoo and my hair didn&#x27;t style the same, so I washed.  Then I did it again the day after the wash, yup, lasted 3 days again.  For about $3.00 a can, this product works great for me.  So far I&#x27;ve used my 1st can for about 2 1/2 weeks now and it&#x27;s still about half full.  Obviously amount of product use is going to alter length of time that can lasts, but for me, spending $20+ or spending $3 is pretty much a no-brainer.  I will continue to use the Suave for my in-between hair washing needs.</li>
    <li> This works just as well, if not better than any other spray dry shampoo out there and has the best smell. Although, I am in love with grapefruit, so the smell is perfect for me. It&#x27;s just a shame that the price keeps going up.</li>
    <li> While this smells way better than most other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, that&#x27;s the best part of the product. It didn&#x27;t really help the oil and it made my fine hair feel like there was a lot of buildup in it. I didn&#x27;t have the issue of other reviewers in that there wasn&#x27;t a lot of product but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again simply because there are a lot of other drugstore dry shampoos like Psssst or Batiste that do much more for my second day hair.  For the record, I have healthy hair that&#x27;s color treated, long, and fine and this just wasn&#x27;t the product for me. Would not recommend and will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo I have found.  Too bad they have discontinued it.  (Suave&#x27;s new dry shampoo replacement is horrible.)</li>
    <li> I cannot imagine how this product got any positive reviews, especially from those with fine hair. I have very thick hair and it did nothing for me except make my hair look greasy (the opposite of what I was going for). It sprays on clear and makes my hair look wet and clumpy. Such a shame because the smell and price are both nice. The only thing that works for me is Batiste. It&#x27;s more expensive but it works.</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo works well and smells good.  I would reccommend it for anyone looking for a good dry shampoo.</li>
    <li> This is the only dry shampoo I use to keep my hair looking fresh in between washes!</li>
    <li> It works well but the odor can be a little floral and overpowering depending on how much I use</li>
    <li> It makes my hair smell a little better, when im on 3 day hair I Like the cold refreshing felling it gives , will I buy again yes because it&#x27;s really cheap</li>
    <li> I like this product. I have hair that tends to be a bit greassy and after a day it needs to be washed. I used this and it helped thought it wasnt as good as washing it. If you dont have overly greassy hair this would be great for you</li>
    <li> I really love this dry shampoo. It has a pleasant scent and it can in handy because I had several surgeries where I could&#x27;nt wash my hair the regular way. So this has been a real life saver.</li>
    <li> Great value, nice smell, does a good job when I need to go another day or so without washing my hair.</li>
    <li> I got this dry shampoo because I was having a BAHA (bone anchored hearing aid) implanted and wasn&#x27;t able to wash my hair for 2 weeks after. It did not work at all. It made my hair feel weird, it didn&#x27;t make it appear any less oily. I tried using more product, less product, rubbing it in more, rubbing it in less. It just made my hair look flat and horrible. And it smelled terrible. I don&#x27;t use anything like mousse, hair spray, or gel in my hair, so it literally just had to work on my normal hair. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> This does not get rid of the oil as well as their Professionals line and the scent is too strong. I will not be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I have fine, naturally dark brown hair that now at 42 is starting to thin. I have tried more expensive brands of dry shampoo (Bumble &amp; Bumble comes to mind) and they did what they were supposed to, freshen my hair, but they didn&#x27;t blow me away and were an extra I could do without.  Suave Professionals Dry Shampoo Spray also did what it was supposed to do at a fraction of the price.  I use it to freshen my hairline and top of my scalp in between shampoos, and on days my hair just looks flat or oily.  It smells nice and the powder disappears in my hair--something I&#x27;ve had a problem with with other brands. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair look freshly washed or add too much body, but it is enough of a visual improvement that it is definitely worth using.  And at this price, it&#x27;s a great way to try out a dry shampoo spray.</li>
    <li> I was really tired of my oily hair for a long time. If I wash it today, it will be oily by the following day and I can&#x27;t wash my hair everyday because it causes too much hair fall. So I went online and read reviews on various dry shampoos. This was the only product which had such a great review.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried this twice and didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I didn&#x27;t wash my hair for a week when I first used this product. So I thought it was so oily that this product didn&#x27;t work. Then next day I wash with traditional shampoo and the following day I gave it a second try but still it didn&#x27;t work! My hair is still oily. It just have the light scent but that&#x27;s all it does! I regret buying this. WIll try another one.</li>
    <li> SMELLY!!!! Seriously, it&#x27;s so strong it made me want to run away from my own head, bleh!! Also, I can&#x27;t say for SURE that this was the cause, but some of my hair started falling out after using this product around 3X per week. I read that some brands of dry shampoo clog up the hair folicles and causes them to shrink and let the hair die. I stopped losing hair and it grew back about three months after I stopped using this product, so I&#x27;m pretty convinced that this was the cause!</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! Great smell! WOrks awesome. Only issue is that it came to me with the cap in pieces, the dry shampoo had sprayed out in corner and the can feels very light now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently been introduced to dry shampoos and I&#x27;m a big fan. I originally tried the name brands (about $12-$15) and I think they work the same as this Suave product. It has a light fruity almost pineapple scent.</li>
    <li> I can only ask of those who say they only got a couple of uses out of the can - did you shake the can before using it?  I mean REALLY shake it well?  I&#x27;ve probably used my can 4 - 5 times, several good sprays each time, and I still have product left in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair, and if I want to eke out one more day between washes, I use the Suave dry shampoo.  I use it in the evening, following the directions, and pin it up in a bun to sleep.  Next day I brush it out again and style it.  Doing this the night before allows the mineral clay to absorb more oil.  In the morning my hair looks clean and I don&#x27;t see any white residue on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care for the smell, but again using it in the evening helps, as it gives the smell a chance to dissipate overnight.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff daily as I shower at night and by morning, I need a touch up at the crown of my head.  This stuff works great and I haven&#x27;t had the problem of it not lasting long - as I&#x27;ve read in other reviews.  However - WARNING to people that do like this product - Do NOT try the Suave dry shampoo with Keratin. That stuff has such an overwhelming smell to it, it&#x27;s like you soaked your hair in Chem Lab. The smell lasts ALL DAY too. The \\&quot;Beautiful Clean\\&quot; kind doesn&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
    <li> For the cheap price i tried it.  And am glad i did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compares to other higher end brands and works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From now on i&#x27;ll be using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fyi caucasian fine straight hair</li>
    <li> this product really works, but I can&#x27;t get past the smell!  Smells like clay.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame they can&#x27;t make it smell better because it really works, irregardless of the color of your hair.</li>
    <li> i love it&lt;br /&gt;And i will bey form you net time&lt;br /&gt;and i will see what do you have by visit your store&lt;br /&gt;sorry for late</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a dry shampoo that would not weigh down my hair or leave a white residue in my hair.  This does a good job but it still has that hair spray feel to it.  It kinda makes your hair heavy and I already have thick hair.  But otherwise it a good job.</li>
    <li> it works wonderful soft smell and is exactly what was needed to save the day if you have oily hair get it</li>
    <li> I cannot wash my hair everyday related to medical issues-so needed something to &amp;#34;hold me over&amp;#34;..Most of my life I had to wash my hair daily-then finding this made all the difference in the world. I still tend to be &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; but now I can go 3 days without washing, If you use a little or even a bit more-the effects are exactly what you are looking for...(really dry to lightly dry)---nonetheless leaves hair smooth. Actually by the second day, my hair even looks better!...II will be buying this again and again...!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: This is much better than Suave&#x27;s &amp;#34;upgraded&amp;#34; Keratin option..&lt;br /&gt;I tried Suave Keratin-but found it to be sticky-and if used too much at a time will make your hair greasy.... great scent but gotta be careful with how much is used,</li>
    <li> This stuff stinks! It&#x27;s just awful!  It smells like mold. Shame on Suave.&lt;br /&gt;In a pinch face powder works, but any talc powder works just fine.</li>
    <li> like it but use it 4 times and it&#x27;s gone (I do have long hair though)</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product but the smell was absolutely overpowering and lingered all day. It&#x27;s begins as a citrus scent but also smells musty and a bit like cat urine. It did work well on my hair which is long, fine, often getting oily at the roots while being dry at the ends. It absorbed the oil and gave me an extra day before having to wash my hair. I also used it on my clean hair to give it a bit more of a lift and body.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I discontinued using it and moved on to another product that costs twice as much was because of the smell. If they come out with a new, fresher or unscented version I would definitely use this product again.</li>
    <li> This works just as well as the expensive dry shampoos at a fraction of the price. The only problem is that it has a VERY VERY strong grapefruit scent. It&#x27;s not necessarily a bad smell but not great either and way too strong. It always overpowers whatever perfume I have on. Other than that, it works so I limit my use for when I&#x27;m in a pinch.</li>
    <li> This was really nasty.  It smells so strong and is very messy. I have used baby powder before and it was easier to control and worked just as well if not better.</li>
    <li> I didnt realize it was a citrus scent or i wouldnt have bought it. I bought 4 or 5 cans (cant remember) bc it was so cheap w free shipping. and it works amazing i am just not big on the citrus aroma. but its a million times better than the other one i bought that reeked of flowers! it stuck in my nose and throat forever. i am not big on the citrus but I can tolerate it (and cover it w perfume/body spray lol).</li>
    <li> i have very curly hair and wash my hair every other day... on the days that I dont wash it I spray a little of this on my scalp and it keeps it from getting greasy &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Better than I could have imagined... I&#x27;ve long liked Suave products with their pretty packaging, appealing scents, and low prices, so I decided to give this a try. My hair is fairly long, with the usual long hair hazard of getting greasy near the scalp, dry on the ends, and finding that a 1/3 or 1/2 head shampoo doesn&#x27;t work very well. Besides, I want to keep color and highlights as fresh as possible for as long as possible! This dry shampoo totally is shake, spray, fluff, and go. The \\&quot;what is this?\\&quot; although not unpleasant scent is the only reason it gets 4 rather than 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have gone through countless bottles of this dry shampoo. I use this product everyday to add volume and I use it if I want to skip washing hair for a day. It can leave a white or gray cast to hair, but once you learn how to work with it that isn&#x27;t an issue. I would however recommend this for people with blonde or lighter brown hair. If you have dark brown or black hair you should try the Suave Keratin infused dry shampoo because it is less white. The only thing I don&#x27;t like the product is the smell! It can be over powering when you are applying it, but it fades quickly and once it does I get a ton of complaints on the smell of my hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, well worth the cost. I&#x27;ve tried a number of different dry shampoos, including pricier ones, and this one is definitely among the top two or three. It has a great smell, but it&#x27;s not overpowering. More importantly, it does a great job of soaking up oil. Just a few sprays go a long way, and I love that even if you go crazy and spray a ton all over your roots, you don&#x27;t look like you dumped powder on your head. My hair is two-toned (dark brown underneath and medium blond on top), and it blends easily with both. My only issue with it is that the contents of the can tend to separate fairly easily, which leads to the spray becoming a bit wet (as opposed to powdery) as it comes out of the can. This is easily fixed with a vigorous shake of the can, though (which you&#x27;re instructed to do anyway). It&#x27;s best to just shake it between sprays, throughout the application process.</li>
