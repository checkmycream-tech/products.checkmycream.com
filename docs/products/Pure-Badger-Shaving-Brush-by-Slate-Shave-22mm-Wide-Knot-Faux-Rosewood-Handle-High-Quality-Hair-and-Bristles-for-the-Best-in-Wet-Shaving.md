      <li>The bristles are firmly attached and do a wonderful job of applying shaving soap.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t look or feel cheap</li>
      <li>I have read this happening with others that go in on the free brush.</li>

      <li>I love it so much I shaved twice today</li>
      <li>Nice brush, soft on the skin holds lather well.</li>
      <li>All in all not even worth it free.</li>
      <li>I am more satisfied with my previous brush (cost more than $50), but it is a matter of habit.</li>
      <li>I used some super glue to repair it...</li>
      <li>I intend to purchase more as gifts for the holidays and Highly Recommend this item if you want to experience a truly luxurious shave.</li>
      <li>Firm bristles that create a great lather.</li>
      <li>For the price, I thought I would be more wow&#x27;d by this product.  </li>
      <li>and I take that to be a good thing based on other reviews I have read.  </li>
      <li>There are better brushes out there if you can spend a little more, or go the cheaper route with a boar bristle brush.</li>
      <li>It whipped up a lather fairly quick for me, however I am very novice with this process</li>
      <li>Since the first couple of shaves it is averaging about 4 1/2 hairs lost per shave.</li>
      <li>This is my first brush, and it feels so damn</li>
      <li>I really like this brush!</li>
      <li>like to soak this guy in hot water as I take a shower</li>
      <li>This is my first shaving brush</li>
      <li>First class product...</li>
      <li>It requires quite a heavy load of soap to create a good lather...</li>
      <li>at first for the first 2 weeks it was great but starting to notice the feel of the hole forming off center in the bristles....</li>
      <li>It lost a few more hairs but still worked fine....</li>
      <li>It produces a nice lather with soft Italian soaps like razorock xxx.  </li>
      <li>pure luxury...high quality bristle and handle.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had shaving brushes in the past and when I used this Pure Badger shaving brush I could tell immediately that it was much smoother and more precise.  </li>
      <li>Very High Quality shaving tool.  </li>
      <li>I have used a shaving brush my whole life</li>
      <li>its very noticeable on my face.....</li>
      <li>Which isn&#x27;t my issue, the problem is that the whole head of it falls out every time I use it.</li>
      <li>Firm bristles and a handle with a nice heft.</li>
      <li>The tips are pretty soft in my book.</li>
      <li>but this is my first time at this brand, only once before had one did this when I first started straight shaving...but that one was 10 bucks.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a gift for a relative.  I was very impressed with the quality and price.  A very nice brush.</li>
    <li> how do i get my money back ....theres a hole in the bristles were hair is falling out .....its very noticeable on my face.....at first for the first 2 weeks it was great but starting to notice the feel of the hole forming off center in the bristles....i use a SLATE stand and i rinse out the brush after every use and fluff the bristles...i over looked the name SLATE washed off but i cant over look the hole in the hairs ....very disappointed</li>
    <li> This brush is just ok.  It sheds at least 5 hairs with every use which tells me that the knot isn&#x27;t tight.  It&#x27;s also very soft and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of backbone. It produces a nice lather with soft Italian soaps like razorock xxx.  The handle has a nice weight to it but I don&#x27;t recommend it.  I&#x27;m now using a $25 synthetic brush made by whipped dog and that produces a phenomenal lather with minimal effort with soft or hard soaps.  Maybe I just received a bad one.</li>
    <li> Works just like I thought it would, nice brush</li>
    <li> If the items is judged by appearance and feel, then this product would receive 5 stars. If judged by performance and quality, &amp;#60;1 star. I&#x27;ve been using this brush every other day for the past 90 days and its continues to loose a measurable amount of bristles each and every time I use it. Then, after about 45 days of use, the entire knot came off the handle. Failure of the knot adhesive seems to be quite prevalent with this brush.  I&#x27;d return it if I could.</li>
    <li> Poor Quality. The center is not real wood (it&#x27;s a wood looking wrap), the logo smeared off, and it completely fell apart after 2 weeks of use (brush fell out of handle). I sent it back. Garbage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this one week and it has fallen apart!  The brush just fell out of the handle!  I might be able to fix with epoxy but why should I have to fix it?  $50 of crap!</li>
    <li> Everything arrived before expected which was great! Everything was quality products and love giving as a gift. Keep up the great work!!! Bob</li>
    <li> packaged nicely, soft as it gets, and holds the soap great.  I could not have hoped for more.  GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT PEOPLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS GABE FOR THE WONDERFULL SERVICE AND PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RON</li>
    <li> Very High Quality shaving tool.  The bristles are firmly attached and do a wonderful job of applying shaving soap.  I intend to purchase more as gifts for the holidays and Highly Recommend this item if you want to experience a truly luxurious shave.</li>
    <li> For being advertised as a better product all of the hair is super glued or hot glue together. Which isn&#x27;t my issue, the problem is that the whole head of it falls out every time I use it. So, not happy with how it holds up over all.</li>
    <li> The quality of this brush is as good as any that I have tried before.  I like the style with a wood-like handle and chrome trim.  My only disappointment is that the bristles are not as stiff as they could be.  This is a very soft brush.  I will get used to it but I do prefer a stiffer brush.</li>
    <li> It looks really nice, but the brush hair need to be thicker (or shorter in length) for better shaving experience.  When the brush is wet, it doesn&#x27;t have a firm feel when you apply the shaving cream, and feels like a mop.</li>
    <li> After using this brush for two weeks, the result is a resounding &amp;#34;meh.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s a functional brush but nothing more. For my tastes, the bristles are too long, giving the brush no backbone. Also, the curves on the handle are too tight for it to be comfortable in my hand. My knot hasn&#x27;t yet detached from the handle, but from reading other reviews it seems like the day will eventually come.</li>
    <li> Not real wood in the center and the liner dings off pretty easily when not gently set into it holder.</li>
    <li> Everything about the brush appears to be of good quality except for the knot falling out after first use. I also received the ivory one instead of the rosewood that I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;Returning the it and reordered another to give it another chance due to the high user rating.</li>
    <li> Great brush - high quality and has the right balance of stiff/soft to apply shaving cream</li>
    <li> Just shaved with this brush today and love it! Builds a great lather and nice solid weight! I think I&#x27;m going to order the silver tip to have in my shaving rotation!</li>
    <li> Got this brush as part of a promo this company did. Smelled like badger for a really long time and eventually the knot feel out. All in all not even worth it free.</li>
    <li> Awesome, soft, full lather.  Beautifully crafted.  Looks expensive, but at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> Great weight, well-balanced.  Bristles are heavy enough to lather but soft enough for the skin.</li>
    <li> Nice brush, soft on the skin holds lather well.</li>
    <li> This is Scott and not Christine (we share the account). I loved everything about this brush until I started using it.  #1 It sheds a lot.  Some shedding is expected on a new badger brush but this one has lost probably 30 hairs after 5 uses. #2 the knot just fell out after the fifth use, making it useless.  It literally just fell out.  The handle has real good heft to it and I think I&#x27;m going to buy a new knot for it, though, not a slate knot.</li>
    <li> This is the item I needed and was looking for. It is better quality than I was hoping. I do think this item would made a great gift.</li>
    <li> This is my first brush, and it feels so damn good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to soak this guy in hot water as I take a shower so it&#x27;s even softer when I need it. What else is there to say though? It feels good, loads up nice and well, looks good and I have lost nary a badger hair from it, but some are to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Slate&amp;#34; lettering on the side however is all but gone, but I rather prefer that anyway-- just chrome, faux wood (although it&#x27;s hard to tell) and badger hair is fine by me without any branding.</li>
    <li> Brush is as anticipated..  Firm bristles and a handle with a nice heft. Expect many comfortable shaves using this brush</li>
    <li> I have used a shaving brush my whole life and I had forgotten the difference between using a cheap brush and an genuine badger hair shaving brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never used one before allow me to enlighten. First of all a few hairs will fall out until the brush is &amp;#34;seasoned&amp;#34;. This is one way to tell you have a high quality brush. The cheap imitations made of nylon or whatever it is don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next thing to look for is if the bristles are stiff but still soft. I have yet to see anything that will do that other than the true badger hair brushes. This will allow for lots of lather while not scratching your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this product in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highest quality I have ever owned. It is a very solid piece with a beautiful handle that comes in a very nice gift box. Perfect for fathers day, Christmas, birthdays or just to tell dad he needs a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it. I promise you will never go to any other method. I love it so much I shaved twice today just so I could use it again.</li>
    <li> I was expecting more this price.</li>
    <li> It fell apart in under 6 months.  The bristles came out and renders this product now useless.  I would not ever buy it again and would encourage you to keep shopping!</li>
    <li> Looks great. I am more satisfied with my previous brush (cost more than $50), but it is a matter of habit. I definitely recommend this brush</li>
    <li> For the price, I thought I would be more wow&#x27;d by this product.  It requires quite a heavy load of soap to create a good lather... I feel like it has too many hairs, but the hairs don&#x27;t fall out, so thats something... i guess</li>
    <li> sit&#x27;s on the stand I bought with my old school safety razor perfectly.</li>
    <li> It is everything I expected.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected and I received it before I anticipated. I&#x27;ve used it twice at this point and I love it.</li>
    <li> Very nice piece. Has some good wieght to it and feels comfortable in the hand. Only thing i didn&#x27;t like about it is that it says in the discription that it&#x27;s handle is rosewood and its not its just a laminate print on, so that alone should lower the cost.</li>
    <li> the pureBadger brush has a good feel in my hands as well as being very stylish and feels good on my face I would recommend it to anyone who wetshaves</li>
    <li> I was one of 40 that were given a brush for free to review and post or thoughts. Well here are mine.    There is a chance that I received a dud. My Parker was a dud and lost maybe 200 hairs over the past 2 years. I&#x27;ll start with the part I find disturbing and then finish with the good stuff. The biggest problem I have is the amount of hairs lost over the last 10 shaves. Every brush will lose a few but in 10 lathers I have lost AT LEAST 71 hairs. These are the ones I visually saw and counted. Since the first couple of shaves it is averaging about 4 1/2 hairs lost per shave. Again. I could have a dud. I asked one person about the silvertip they were given and they only lost a couple. I&#x27;ve been much less aggressive with this brush than my others so *shrug*.    Not so bad, mixed feelings really, is the handle. It looks great! If you like to rest the base of the handle in the palm of your hand and have your thumb and forefinger at the top of the handle it works great and feels great! This is how I hold mine the majority of the time. If you are one of those that hold the bottom 1/2 inch of the base then you might run into problems as it feels insecure in my hand like that. For me it works great but some may not like it.    The tips are pretty soft in my book. I have only pure and best badgers to compare with it I like this one best. It has the softest backbone of my badgers but it whips up a good lather in no time. The look of the brush is pleasing to my eyes.    The price is pretty good too.    UPDATE--------------------------  It lost a few more hairs but still worked fine....Until the knot fell out. I have read this happening with others that go in on the free brush. It can be fixed once I rough up the inside of the metal collar and epoxy the knot back in...... but I&#x27;m lazy. I&#x27;ve downgraded my rating to 2 stars as it is a fixable problem if you have the know how. There are better brushes out there if you can spend a little more, or go the cheaper route with a boar bristle brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had shaving brushes in the past and when I used this Pure Badger shaving brush I could tell immediately that it was much smoother and more precise.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> First class product...pure luxury...high quality bristle and handle.</li>
    <li> Poorly constructed.  Bristles separated from handle after four uses.  Not sure what caused the adhesive to fail ....</li>
    <li> I used it the day after it arrived , very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Quality item for an unbelievably low price.  My son took it as soon as he saw it so I need to order another one .</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;ve only used the Slate shaving brush twice, but it has a great feel, lathers beautifully and looks great!</li>
    <li> Honestly, 3 uses and fell apart on me.  Thank God for JB Weld, I&#x27;ve been using these for years but this is my first time at this brand, only once before had one did this when I first started straight shaving...but that one was 10 bucks.  It did hold the hairs in though.  All in all, avoid as its crap for the price.</li>
    <li> This is my first shaving brush so I cant give as in depth a review as the veteran shavers who have posted their reviews.  I can say in terms of weight and appearance it is solid and very attractive.  It doesn&#x27;t look or feel cheap and I have received several compliments on it sitting next to my bathroom sink.  It whipped up a lather fairly quick for me, however I am very novice with this process so I don&#x27;t think I got the water to lather ratio quite down yet.  However, it still did a great job and I blame the mechanics on myself.  The brush was very soft on my skin, yet stiff enough to hold a large amount of lather.  I only noticed that I lost 3 hairs on my first shave with it and I take that to be a good thing based on other reviews I have read.  Based on the other brushes I looked at this one appeared to be the best value as far as appearance and price.  After my first use I am happy to add functionality to that list as well.  I would def recommend this brush, however, I may urge others to rely on the more seasoned DE shavers who have posted their reviews for brushes.</li>
    <li> As advertised this brush is a beauty! Firm bristles that create a great lather. It has a balanced weight and looks great on my bathroom counter top.</li>
    <li> Well constructed. Slight smell to the bristles that fades with use.</li>
    <li> Minimal shedding, quality handle.</li>
    <li> Delivered on July 17. As mentioned in other reviews, the bristle knot fell out of the handle after 4 shaves. I am a wet shave veteran, and that is a new record for me.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush!</li>
    <li> I like the look &amp; feel of the brush, but the bristles separated from the handle after about three weeks of use.  I used some super glue to repair it...so far so good.</li>
    <li> Looks, feel, size, balance...this brush is excellent in all categories. I was looking to replace another brush that had served me well, but I struck out a couple of times until I tried this one. The search is over.  Update: 8 months later, bristles are falling out at an alarming rate. Not as happy anymore. Dropped from 5 to 2. I hate when bristles fall out and stick. Feels like  a bug is crawling on my face. For the price this should have lasted longer. The search continues.</li>
    <li> Nicely made brush. My brush needed to be cleaned in vinegar and soap to remove the badger smell. I realize that this is not unusual but it is something the maker could have done as well. It is a handsome brush and it seems well made. I recommend a stand that holds any brush bristles down. I have had 2 other brushes for years and the stand I believe helped keep them from cracking and peeling. Bothe had wooden bases that would have suffered from drying bristles up.</li>
    <li> Yay my fiancé loved this brush I&#x27;m super excited I bought it!!!!</li>
    <li> brush head fell out.  Cost of item was returned.</li>
    <li> I have just received my badger brush and tried it for the first time, it felt great. The bristles were soft and they held the lather perfectly. If you are just coming back to the way your father and grandfather use to shave this is the brush for you</li>
    <li> Excellent product. my husband like it, by now and then we will shop only from slate shave... I highly recimend it.</li>
