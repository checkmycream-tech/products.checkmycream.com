      <li>Perfect .5 guard!</li>
      <li>Great buy!</li>
      <li>Great!!</li>
      <li>Good! very happy with them.</li>
      <li>Good quality!</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why a 3 pack is great here.  </li>
      <li>i would be a happy camper.</li>
      <li>They work good</li>
      <li>Glad I bought it!</li>
      <li>so I had to get a new one, found this three pack and thought that it&#x27;d be a great idea to have three just in case I foolishly break another one, great buy...</li>
      <li>I also noticed that the shipping cost more than the price for the 3 blades.  </li>
      <li>These combs are perfect and will last me quite a bit of time</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I need three more words.</li>
      <li>glad i bought 3 of these unbreakable never ending guards.</li>
      <li>then we will have a guard that will hold up for many uses...</li>
      <li>Great high quality Wahl product.</li>
      <li>These are the perfect sizes to not look rough.</li>
      <li>will be one happy barber when the company decides to make these guards thicker in diameter like they did their #1 guards just recently...</li>
      <li>The plastic that they are made from is brittle and cheap.</li>
      <li>It keeps it trim and clean and you look prefessional, not unkept or rugged</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great guide for high and tight hair cuts using the #1/2 on the sides and the #2 on top.</li>
      <li>They fit properly and do exactly what the original did.  </li>
      <li>shipped fast, well worth it.</li>
      <li>My husabnd is in the military and cuts his own hair.</li>
      <li>I was happy I found these, but wished the company selling them would have packed them differently so shipping was less.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered these twice already (I shave my head every week), they are exactly what I need and fit well on my Wahl shaver as expected.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s nice to have several on hand when one goes down, so thanks for offering this product in a multi-pack.</li>
      <li>I needed them desperately, they work great on all my wahl clippers.</li>
      <li>and I have not no problems so far with the product itself.</li>
      <li>for some reason these are hard to find, but well worth the hassle.</li>

<li> They could have easily been thrown into a padded envelope and shipped for at least half the price (shipping was almost double the cost of three blade guards).</li>
<li> I tend to buy dozens of these guards because they will not last long...</li>
<li> These are a much needed item in the barber profession, but these are still just too thin...taking them on and off the clippers just a few times and they are too loose and they tend to make a rattle noise...</li>
<li> The first hasn&#x27;t broken yet.  </li>
<li> I guess it could be error on my part for using it too rough.  </li>
<li> The weight and size of the package is definitely not worth the $10 shipping.</li>
<li> His blade guard was wearing down.</li>
<li> Now I can shave my beard down to an acceptable level at work.</li>

    <li> I had dropped my clippers on accident and ended up breaking the plastic piece so I had to get a new one, found this three pack and thought that it&#x27;d be a great idea to have three just in case I foolishly break another one, great buy...shipped fast, well worth it.</li>
    <li> They fit properly and do exactly what the original did.  Only problem is that after a couple of weeks, one of the \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; will break off then the rest follow.  I guess it could be error on my part for using it too rough.  That&#x27;s why a 3 pack is great here.  I also noticed that the shipping cost more than the price for the 3 blades.  The weight and size of the package is definitely not worth the $10 shipping.</li>
    <li> If they didn&#x27;t break I wouldn&#x27;t be buying multiple replacements! These combs are perfect and will last me quite a bit of time and it&#x27;s nice to have several on hand when one goes down, so thanks for offering this product in a multi-pack.</li>

    <li> The Wahl hair guide, size #1/2, fills the gap between the #1 guide and no guide at all.  It&#x27;s a great guide for high and tight hair cuts using the #1/2 on the sides and the #2 on top.</li>
    <li> for some reason these are hard to find, but well worth the hassle. these aren&#x27;t as durable as the 1/16 that came with my five star clippers but they get the job done.</li>
    <li> The comb that came with my Wahl broke, so I got three as replacement.  The first hasn&#x27;t broken yet.  Yeehaw!</li>
    <li> I needed them desperately, they work great on all my wahl clippers.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I decided to give myself a buzz cut. They work good and I have not no problems so far with the product itself.</li>
    <li> the teeth on these attachments began to fall off after the third use.  The plastic that they are made from is brittle and cheap.</li>
    <li> glad i bought 3 of these unbreakable never ending guards. now if i could only get the blades themselves to come in and not be broke to hell i would be a happy camper.</li>
    <li> My husabnd is in the military and cuts his own hair. His blade guard was wearing down. I was happy I found these, but wished the company selling them would have packed them differently so shipping was less. They could have easily been thrown into a padded envelope and shipped for at least half the price (shipping was almost double the cost of three blade guards).</li>

    <li> Everything went well.</li>
    <li> Great high quality Wahl product. Gives you that manly buzz.</li>
    <li> These are the perfect sizes to not look rough. It keeps it trim and clean and you look prefessional, not unkept or rugged, this works well and they stay in place well.</li>
    <li> Perfect .5 guard! Glad I bought it!</li>
