      <li>LOVE these drops!!</li>
      <li>Good quality and services.</li>
      <li>It reminds me of a very good Hinoki with a powdery but clean element (like Emporio Elle perfume, or Dolce &amp; Gabbana for Men).&lt;br</li>
      <li>takes some getting use to, since the drops had some kind of menthol in it.</li>
      <li>Works better than the over the counter drugs.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not horrible.</li>
      <li>I love how hygienic these drops are.</li>
      <li>and I am so glad</li>
      <li>None of them hold a candle to the Rohto Vita, though I would say that Systane is more comfortable up front.</li>
      <li>The clear bottle is great because they make it easy to tell if the drops are getting clouded or have anything inside of them.</li>
      <li>I was trying to find something more economical .The</li>
      <li>I thought it was a great idea having the vitamins and the eyedrops .I will go back to using Can</li>

      <li>Those had no scent and didn&#x27;t feel nearly as good as these do on a daily basis.</li>
      <li>every morning can last me most of the day, though I often put in more at noon and again at night just to refresh.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is mild and, while I prefer that my eye products NOT be scented, this one does not cause any irritation to my eyes.</li>
      <li>It burned A LOT when I put these in, but after it subsided (about 45 seconds) I noticed a significant difference after just the first use.  </li>

      <li>They may not be right for everyone but for me they are just what I needed.</li>

      <li>Great relief for tired eyes.</li>
      <li>These have helped so much with keeping redness and discomfort at bay.</li>
      <li>None of them helped as much as these.  </li>
      <li>so I thought the vitamin type would help and they really do, for me.</li>
      <li>better than the average eye drops.</li>
      <li>It calms down my eyes and my friends love too after they used this eye drops.</li>
      <li>These are my main drops now and the others are supplemental.</li>
      <li>I do not have any problems with them, they take away the dry eye itchiness with a cool , soothing feeling .</li>
      <li>They also seem to last longer for me then the American brand dry eye drops I got and feel much better</li>
      <li>that has completely transparent packaging like this.</li>
      <li>Once your eyes get used to it though, a couple eyedrops will last the whole day (for me).</li>
      <li>After that my eyes cleared up instantly, I had no tearing and unlike the Oasis which ran back out of my eye, the Rohto drops were absorbed by my eyes.</li>
      <li>use these as my daily drops simply because they are comfortable and do not take long to get used to having in your eyes.</li>
      <li>My tired old eyes love these drops.</li>
      <li>I have also noticed my &#x27;dry eyes&#x27; does not act up as much when I use these once daily</li>
      <li>If you have never used Rohto eyedrops before, the first time you use it, it stings a little for about a minute.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not nearly as long with the Ice product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have eye floaters &amp; worried I was starting to get age related macular degeneration. I was hoping these eye drops would help. I was trying to find something more economical .The drops burn like crazy, instead of making the feeling of sand in my eyes better it made it worse not only that it made my eyes red. I thought it was a great idea having the vitamins and the eyedrops .I will go back to using Can C eye drops they are expensive but help.</li>
    <li> Great relief for tired eyes. It stings a bit but it&#x27;s not horrible.</li>
    <li> better than the average eye drops. your eyes feel fresh</li>
    <li> I love the Rohto VITA eye drops and have never found anything comparable from an American company. When I forget to use these for a few days, my vision actually declines.</li>
    <li> Good quality and services.</li>
    <li> Very good and I would recommend Bshiraha</li>
    <li> I always have an allergy or dried my eyes in spring and fall. It calms down my eyes and my friends love too after they used this eye drops. It feels minty but not hurt. It is a great eye drop from Rohto for me who wear contact and have allergies.</li>
    <li> Felt increased dryness after use. Didn&#x27;t work for me. So the satis review and two star as it was cooling when the drops are just put into the eye.</li>
    <li> IT IS WHAT I ALWAYS USE, IT MAKE MY EYES FELL COOL. BUT I THINK IT IS TOO EXPENSIVE THAN I BOUGHT IT IN STORE.</li>
    <li> I love how hygienic these drops are. They come with a package sealed around them in the box and instructions, though those are all in Japanese. There are some simple images to help along and there are also translations available online for those who really want to know what they say. The clear bottle is great because they make it easy to tell if the drops are getting clouded or have anything inside of them. Rohto is the only brand I&#x27;ve used that has completely transparent packaging like this. This bottle design will also lie flat in your pocket, though I keep mine in a section of my bag reserved for chapstick and any medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These drops specifically have a vaguely spice-like scent. It&#x27;s not strong like clove and doesn&#x27;t have the obvious cinnamon scent, but it definitely smells like some of the lighter brown spices. Nutmeg comes to mind. The fragrance is mild and, while I prefer that my eye products NOT be scented, this one does not cause any irritation to my eyes. Before getting this I used the American Rohto product, Rohto Ice. Those had no scent and didn&#x27;t feel nearly as good as these do on a daily basis. The Vita drops only take a few seconds to get used to in your eyes, though I still have an impulse to keep my eyes closed for a few seconds after putting them in. It&#x27;s not nearly as long with the Ice product. Cooling from these drops is minimal, but they still have a soothing effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these as my daily drops simply because they are comfortable and do not take long to get used to having in your eyes. The packaging is handy and hygienic, which is probably the best part of the product besides the formula. I have frequent problems with dry eyes and two drops in each eye every morning can last me most of the day, though I often put in more at noon and again at night just to refresh. I work in the back of a restaurant and often deal with smoke and steam in my face. These have helped so much with keeping redness and discomfort at bay. I can&#x27;t wait to try other Rohto products, though I want to say I&#x27;ll keep these as my go-to for eye drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Non-Rohto brand drops that I&#x27;ve used in the past are OptiFree PureMoist, Walgreen&#x27;s generic drops, and Systane. None of them hold a candle to the Rohto Vita, though I would say that Systane is more comfortable up front. Vita is superior overall due to longevity of effect compared to other eye drops used and the fact that I&#x27;ll know at a glance is my package has gone bad.</li>
    <li> I have suffered for a few years now with watery itchy eyes due in part to allergies but my opthamologist said it was also due to age and narrowing of the tear duct. It comes and goes but when it flares up it&#x27;s very annoying. My eyes would tear up and I would have to keep tissues nearby. My eye doctor sold me Oasis eye drops which do nothing and are costly. I would put the Oasis drops in several times a day with no relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was doing research online for other solutions and read that Vitamin A drops might help. I searched on Amazon for this and Rohto eye drops came up. Vitamin A is one of the ingredients. I figured I would try it and I am so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like a few have mentioned it burns for a few seconds after application. After that my eyes cleared up instantly, I had no tearing and unlike the Oasis which ran back out of my eye, the Rohto drops were absorbed by my eyes. I can take a few seconds of burning since the drops actually worked to help my itchy watery eyes.</li>
    <li> takes some getting use to, since the drops had some kind of menthol in it. does wake u right up thou.</li>
    <li> Probably my FAVOURITE product of 2015! (Among the things I&#x27;ve bought this year, I mean. And for the rec, I bought every single type of drops put out by Rohto, if that tells you anything.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t experience any sting AT ALL, and it ALWAYS makes my tired (and/or dry, red, teary, gritty, tragic, over-eye-linered) eyes feel at least a little bit better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The OTHER reason for my obsession is the SCENT of this stuff. It reminds me of a very good Hinoki with a powdery but clean element (like Emporio Elle perfume, or Dolce &amp; Gabbana for Men).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I regret is that the bottle is too small for me to give a big hug every time it saves me from gritty-eyed misery and doom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mwa, Rohto, MWA!&lt;br /&gt;:)&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> Great product. Works better than the over the counter drugs.</li>
    <li> My tired old eyes love these drops. Best I&#x27;ve tried and that&#x27;s saying a lot.</li>
    <li> LOVE these drops!! I have dry eyes and did not know this brand made them for dry eyes too so I thought the vitamin type would help and they really do, for me. They have a bit of menthol in them so be warned, my husband tried them and his eyes got all bloodshot and he wont use them again. I do not have any problems with them, they take away the dry eye itchiness with a cool , soothing feeling . They also seem to last longer for me then the American brand dry eye drops I got and feel much better then the vasoline type paste I got from the eye doctor. I have also noticed my &#x27;dry eyes&#x27; does not act up as much when I use these once daily but if I forget they act right up. They may not be right for everyone but for me they are just what I needed.</li>
    <li> Not sure what they should feel like, but not very comfortable to apply - not painful tho&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;The dropper is small and cute- easy to carry in a pocket.</li>
    <li> This is the only eye drops I use now.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyedrops.</li>
    <li> Thank you for these drops. I have a scratch on my eye that causes the cells to break each morning, this helps in the day with vco at night.</li>
    <li> I have dry eyes my entire life. This is the best eyedrops I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful though. If you have never used Rohto eyedrops before, the first time you use it, it stings a little for about a minute. Once your eyes get used to it though, a couple eyedrops will last the whole day (for me).</li>
    <li> Awesome drops! I also love the cute little candy the seller included as a gift. Great seller!</li>
    <li> I have a condition that causes very bad dry eye.  I have tried all kinds of drops, including prescription and serum drops.  None of them helped as much as these.  It burned A LOT when I put these in, but after it subsided (about 45 seconds) I noticed a significant difference after just the first use.  It does feel like they actually heal whereas others just try to shield.  These are my main drops now and the others are supplemental.</li>
