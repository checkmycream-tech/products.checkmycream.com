      <li>Nice tweezers.  </li>
      <li>problem!&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled to find this set of two tweezers, basically for the price of one.</li>
      <li>By far the best tweezers I&#x27;be ever used.  </li>
      <li>Amazing tweezers, and a fantastic deal!</li>
      <li>In fact I kind of like them better because I&#x27;ll be able to keep them in my purse, or use for traveling.</li>
      <li>The pointy set seem to be fine, but don&#x27;t have a nicely milled edge.</li>
      <li>have used this product more than 1 year</li>
      <li>They do offer FREE sharpening!  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re compact and fit nicely in a makeup bag without taking up a lot of space.</li>
      <li>I love these tweezers.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad this came in a set as I have one in my travel bag and one in my gym bag.</li>
      <li>I have two or more at all times.  </li>
      <li>thought they would be better quality</li>
      <li>Better than what I have paid for at stores for 15.00 a pair</li>
      <li>I love tweezerman.</li>
      <li>They are very precise and easy to use.</li>
      <li>If you just want a good set that can do double duty, however, this is a good choice.</li>
      <li>The slanted set don&#x27;t even meet at the point of the slant, where it&#x27;s most important that they meet.</li>
      <li>I got a lot of snap off hairs that risk becoming ingrown.</li>
      <li>Love the colors &amp; the tips and fantastic.</li>
      <li>I prefer the mini style, as it&#x27;s more comfortable in my hand.</li>
      <li>The mini slant is perfect for quick eyebrow grooming and the point tweezer gets those tiny hairs even at stubble length.</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s the mini size that make these tweezers less than exemplary; I don&#x27;t find them especially effective.</li>
      <li>no matter how fine.....</li>
      <li>The point tweezer is quite useful, and I am glad I bought both.</li>
      <li>And there&#x27;s always the tweezerman free sharpening-for-life promise.</li>
      <li>Actually they work great -</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I ordered the set as opposed to just replacing my trusty slant tweezers as I never would have known how useful the pointed tweezers can be.</li>
      <li>Not as good as the old one I purchased.</li>
      <li>I first found this brand of tweezers while shopping at a Mall and loved them so much I bought a set for each member of my family.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The pointed one could be sharper and more pointed, but it is pretty decent.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The pink tweezers are great for eyebrows or facial hair, while the purple ones are great for ingrown hairs.  </li>
      <li>These are excellent - and when you&#x27;re trying to pull pieces of possible infection (splinters) out of yourself, isn&#x27;t it worth a few extra bucks in order to give yourself the best chance of success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>True quality, precision instruments.  </li>
      <li>aLL TtWEEZERMAN TWEEZERS ARE WORTH THE MONEY tweeze away with the satisfaction of a precise instrument</li>
      <li>None of them are near as good as the first one.</li>
      <li>I like the normal size better.</li>
      <li>The are very sharp and work great to tweeze eye brows.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re mainly looking for ingrown hair tweezers, though, the Tweezerman GEAR point tweezers are the best (I&#x27;ve tried four different kinds and those are the clear winner).  </li>
      <li>Very petite, which is fine.  </li>
      <li>great, convenient little two-pack.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re great for travel or for everyday use.</li>
      <li>Much smaller than I anticipated but still the amazing tweezers we expect from Tweezerman</li>
      <li>A choice of color would have been nice, but not a big deal.</li>
      <li>Are they worth it, yes.</li>
      <li>Although they are much smaller than I expected, they are the BEST TWEEZERS I HAVE EVER</li>
      <li>My old tweezers, which are worn, are still far superior to these...</li>
      <li>Kind of short handles.</li>
      <li>Great grip surface and very sharp, to get the smallest and finest hairs!</li>
      <li>WOW was he ever RIGHT!!  </li>
      <li>They just work so much better, with great precision and grip -- those random eyebrow hairs don&#x27;t stand a chance.  </li>
      <li>These little babies are just as good as their full-sized versions.</li>
      <li>These are pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are GREAT! Yes, they&#x27;re smaller than your average size tweezer, but they work great for me. Love the colors &amp; the tips and fantastic.</li>
    <li> Great pair of tweezers.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman is the BEST product for eyebrows.  Someone &amp;#34;stole&amp;#34; my set so I ordered again.  I MUST have them!</li>
    <li> These tweezers are perfect for travel!</li>
    <li> These are pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pointed one could be sharper and more pointed, but it is pretty decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue might be their rather small size, but I guess that make these ideal for travel...</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother. While the weight of these mini tweezers is substantial the quality of workmanship is not. The slanted set don&#x27;t even meet at the point of the slant, where it&#x27;s most important that they meet. I couldn&#x27;t even get hold of an eyebrow hair. The pointy set seem to be fine, but don&#x27;t have a nicely milled edge. My old tweezers, which are worn, are still far superior to these...and I&#x27;m sure they were less expensive. What a waste of money. I will try to return but only if the company will pay for shipping. I&#x27;ll let you know...</li>
    <li> These are amazingly sharp and work so well on even very fine hair.  If you&#x27;re looking for really good tweezers, these are the ones.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman is the best tweezers in the world.  The last forever.  I only need to replace mind when I lose them.</li>
    <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with Tweezerman tweezers. These mini ones are great and fit in even the smallest purses for on-the-go tweezing.</li>
    <li> After 8 years, I just sent off my regular tweezerman slant tweezers for their first sharpening. For someone with eyebrow OCD, the prospect of not seeing my tweezers for weeks makes me more than a little panicky, so I decided to break down and buy some new ones.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve probably tried every other brand in the drugstore trying to save a couple of bucks, but no other brand I&#x27;ve found comes close to the precision of Tweezerman. Tiny, broken, or ingrown hairs? No problem!&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled to find this set of two tweezers, basically for the price of one. Yeah, they&#x27;re mini, but they work just as well as the standard size. In fact I kind of like them better because I&#x27;ll be able to keep them in my purse, or use for traveling. And there&#x27;s always the tweezerman free sharpening-for-life promise. Love them!</li>
    <li> Much smaller than I anticipated but still the amazing tweezers we expect from Tweezerman</li>
    <li> Keeps ahold of the hair, even the stubborn deep rooted hairs.  I&#x27;ve misplaced my pointy one already, but the slanted works just as well</li>
    <li> Great size without compromising quality. I have ordered from this company before so I know that they make great items. Tweezerman is the best at what they do.</li>
    <li> Petite, much smaller than anticipated, yet work very well. Great grip surface and very sharp, to get the smallest and finest hairs!</li>
    <li> Works very well.  I like having the two styles.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried, originally, when I ordered this set, that they would be too small for everyday use.  Actually they work great - I ended up liking them more than my regular sized tweezers.</li>
    <li> I use them for eye brows and pulling out unwanted hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product more than 1 year and they stay sharp.&lt;br /&gt;According to the Warranty, the company will sharpen them for free for life, but I m not sure how realistic they are.&lt;br /&gt;Although, the little one with pointy tip is very tricky to use at first, I got used to it and now easier to use</li>
    <li> This is an awesome tweezer set, the two types are perfect for different types of hairs. They are extremely well made so there are none of those issues where the ends of the tweezers aren&#x27;t quite lined up and don&#x27;t grab, or the metal tip has a sharp edge that cuts the hair instead of grabbing it. Perfect tweezer set in my opinion, and I do a lot of tweezing!</li>
    <li> I love these tweezers! They are sharp and thin and can easily grab small, very fine hairs.</li>
    <li> These are the only tweezers I buy.  The are very sharp and work great to tweeze eye brows.  I also use a pair for picking threads while sewing.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my wife as a present, and she has thanked me for them repeatedly. Both tweezers are nice quality, but the point tweezers are hard to find and great for little slivers. Glad I bought them!</li>
    <li> I love these tweezers. I have 2 sets and bought this one as a gift. They are very precise and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Although they are much smaller than I expected, they are the BEST TWEEZERS I HAVE EVER USED!!!! This is an outstand pair. I can&#x27;t tell you the difference between these and store brands.....might and day! Must try!</li>
    <li> Small and easy to use. the point is sharp and really gets those hairs.</li>
    <li> I love these! They allow me to pluck hairs that I normally can&#x27;t get to (such as those fine blonde ones above the eye but below the brow). They&#x27;re compact and fit nicely in a makeup bag without taking up a lot of space. I use the slanted ones for ingrown hairs that I get from shaving my legs. These loosen those up perfectly! The price of ONE pair of tweezers in your local Sephora is crazy compared to the price on Amazon for the travel set.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers!! Sometimes it snaps the hair off because they are so sharp but other than that they work well.</li>
    <li> I first found this brand of tweezers while shopping at a Mall and loved them so much I bought a set for each member of my family.  My nieces and sisters use them for grooming but I have two hard working mechanics in the family who love these tweezers for those hard to remove metal splinters.  Best Tweezers ever!</li>
    <li> If you want tweezers that will grab very small and very short hairs, this is the one.  You don&#x27;t have to try several time with these. Once is enough to get the job done.</li>
    <li> Better than what I have paid for at stores for 15.00 a pair and you get two here Thanks got what was shown</li>
    <li> This is a good set. The pink tweezers are great for eyebrows or facial hair, while the purple ones are great for ingrown hairs.  If you&#x27;re mainly looking for ingrown hair tweezers, though, the Tweezerman GEAR point tweezers are the best (I&#x27;ve tried four different kinds and those are the clear winner).  If you just want a good set that can do double duty, however, this is a good choice.</li>
    <li> The world&#x27;s best tweezers...who wouldn&#x27;t love having a set of two!</li>
    <li> A friend recommended these to me as a great wood splinter remover.  WOW was he ever RIGHT!!  True quality, precision instruments.  By far the best tweezers I&#x27;be ever used.  Get the pair and give one to a friend.</li>
    <li> These little babies are just as good as their full-sized versions. They&#x27;re great for travel or for everyday use. A choice of color would have been nice, but not a big deal.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the old one I purchased. I thought these were normal size and they are purse size. Guess I didn&#x27;t era that part.</li>
    <li> Love these little tweezers, the two pack is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;They are travel sized and would be great to leave in a purse or travel bag.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand for years, they have always been my first choice.</li>
    <li> Great set of tweezers. The purple pair is great for ingrowns!</li>
    <li> Perfect size and price for me. I do have small hands though. They are great!</li>
    <li> We use absolutely nothing else.  I have two or more at all times.  One extra for when we send one off to be sharpened or aligned.</li>
    <li> Great set! The point tweezers are perfect for removing splinters.</li>
    <li> very small but great for travel bags. I&#x27;m glad this came in a set as I have one in my travel bag and one in my gym bag. Does a great job.</li>
    <li> Amazing tweezers, and a fantastic deal! I prefer the mini style, as it&#x27;s more comfortable in my hand. Unfortunately my last pair of mini Tweezerman tweezers had been used to death and was no longer aligned properly, so I ordered this to replace them. No other brand of tweezer that I&#x27;ve used can compare to these tweezers, so I won&#x27;t settle for anything less than Tweezerman. They are very easy to use (as opposed to other brands where my fingers get sore just from pressing them together), and they get all the hair, every time, saving me tons of frustration and time spent tweezing. With the point tweezers, even the stubborn little hairs that like to go back under the skin after a few tries are no match for Tweezerman. I&#x27;m glad I ordered the set as opposed to just replacing my trusty slant tweezers as I never would have known how useful the pointed tweezers can be. It&#x27;s also cheaper than ordering each pair separately. I keep the little caps on them when not in use to protect the edges and keep them sharp.</li>
    <li> Love this Tweezerman set! I found it quite difficult forking over a somewhat decent amount of money for such small tweezers, but honestly, it&#x27;s so worth it. I&#x27;d buy these tweezers again and again. If your shape your brows, or even just like to pull a few hairs, these tweezers make the perfect set, for an experienced shaper or beginner!</li>
    <li> tweezer man is the best. Kind of short handles. Better for big hands!</li>
    <li> Nice tweezers.  Very petite, which is fine.  Holds grip well.</li>
    <li> You wouldn&#x27;t think it would be that difficult to make a pair of tweezers where the tips aligned evenly.  Apparently it is, so you are forced to spend your money on these.  Are they worth it, yes. I have countless pairs that were supposed quality that don&#x27;t grab the hairs.  These just work perfectly.  They grab the hair in one pull, not five like the Revlon brand.  I bought the smaller pack because I was admittedly too cheap to spend $40 on the standard size of each type.  This size seems usable for even larger hands so I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great for traveling or just carrying in your purse.</li>
    <li> The very BEST tweezers on Planet Earth!  They never dull, and they ALWAYS get that pesky little hair that others cannot.</li>
    <li> NOTHING NEGATVE ABOUT THIS GREAT SET...aLL TtWEEZERMAN TWEEZERS ARE WORTH THE MONEY tweeze away with the satisfaction of a precise instrument</li>
    <li> Best tweezers you can buy!They are great put them in your purse and they are always with you they come in a nice little carrying case!</li>
    <li> They are the small set so a little hard to hold onto with my big hands.  I like the normal size better.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s the mini size that make these tweezers less than exemplary; I don&#x27;t find them especially effective. I got a lot of snap off hairs that risk becoming ingrown.</li>
    <li> This is not my first Tweezerman tweezers and probably won&#x27;t be my last. They&#x27;re long lasting, and as long as you don&#x27;t drop them (oops!) on their point they work great. The pointed tweezer is wonderful for splinters and anything small and doesn&#x27;t make a big hole in your skin. I live in Mexico and a number of folks that have borrowed them have had me order them for them too. I have the set that comes with a case and this was ordered for a lost piece. Can&#x27;t live without them!</li>
    <li> Looking for the best tweezer I purchased a tweezerman. The first one I got will pull any hair...no matter how fine.....but it only pulls using the flat side. Can&#x27;t grasp with pointed tip. I ordered these two minis and a black one since I was so pleased with the first one. None of them are near as good as the first one. I guess buying tweezers is just a crap shoot. I just ordered another one exactly like the first one....so we shall see. May send the three that don&#x27;t work good for sharpening even tho they are brand new</li>
    <li> Insanely expensive (comparatively speaking) but really with the level of quality on these, there is no comparison. These are excellent - and when you&#x27;re trying to pull pieces of possible infection (splinters) out of yourself, isn&#x27;t it worth a few extra bucks in order to give yourself the best chance of success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mini pair is every bit as useful at the larger ones too. I question why anyone would even need the bigger ones. These are awesome.</li>
    <li> After a lifetime of drugstore tweezers, I finally treated myself  to this set and the difference is significant.  They just work so much better, with great precision and grip -- those random eyebrow hairs don&#x27;t stand a chance.  These are the small size, but they are not at all awkward to use and take up no room in a makeup bag.  The point tweezer is quite useful, and I am glad I bought both.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t grub a single little hair! &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> great, convenient little two-pack. I love tweezerman.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers, however, the sharp ones are not as sharp as some other tweezerman&#x27;s i&#x27;ve had. I like the sharp ones to be really sharp to get ingrown and super fine hairs.</li>
    <li> Received a mirror instead of tweezers. Very unhappy.</li>
    <li> Would give it 5 stars if it came with a small case. Regardless, great tweezers.</li>
    <li> First off, they&#x27;re small. If you were hoping for average size, they&#x27;re not, but they are amazing. The mini slant is perfect for quick eyebrow grooming and the point tweezer gets those tiny hairs even at stubble length. I&#x27;ve dropped them on my counter several times and haven&#x27;t had them bend like others have, maybe I&#x27;m just likely.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are very well made and a convenient size for travel.  The tips line up perfectly, allowing maximum pressure to be applied to whatever you are tweezing.</li>
    <li> Love them!  Unfortunately I dropped them!  They do offer FREE sharpening!  They need an attachment for the wrist so they wont fall to the ground!!</li>
    <li> tweezers don&#x27;t work as well as I expected. pretty expensive for the usage. thought they would be better quality</li>
