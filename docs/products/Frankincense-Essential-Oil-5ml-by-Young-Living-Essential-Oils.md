    <li> Best oil in the marketplace.</li>
    <li> I love the Frankincense and use YL oils every day.</li>
    <li> Not as pictured. I recieved a lower grade young living product called  &amp;#34;frerana frankincense&amp;#34; Somalia. I am not happy with this product and was warned by a young living consultant not to buy Young Living oils from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for a great price!</li>
    <li> The Young Living Frankincense Oil is superb. I&#x27;ve used other brands, but the Young Living brand is the best for me and it&#x27;s Certified Pure Therapeutic Grade.</li>
    <li> Love the scent of this product.</li>
    <li> Needed this in a hurry.  I gave my personal bottle to a friend and wanted to replace mine ASAP.  This is one I would not do without.</li>

    <li> This is a very potent  Frankincense.....</li>
    <li> wonderful oil. I  diffuse it  but also  use it  for my  skin.</li>
    <li> Not much to say here. Quality is good. Shipping took awhile but overall I am happy with the purchase. Just wish everyone didnt charge an arm and a leg for this stuff.</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected. However, I wish they would distinguish between Sacred Frankincense and the &#x27;regular&#x27; variety in the description of the item. This is the &#x27;regular&#x27; one.</li>
    <li> I think this is a very good brand.</li>
    <li> Look little different from my older one, originally ordered  from young living website</li>
    <li> Love all the Young Living essential oils!</li>

    <li> this is so good for any bug bites.  I carry it with me and use it on friends and they can&#x27;t believe how well it works.  It is good for cuts as well.  It is small so just keep it in my purse.</li>

    <li> This review only applies to the Young Living frankincense sold by Young Living Independent Distributor!! I am a Young Living independent distributor and my husband and I use Young Living frankincense internally for health issues. Since it is out of stock with the company right now, I hesitantly turned to the Internet because we need it. I spoke with Tim several times through email and he, being a YL distributor as well calmed my fears and doubts about its authenticity and not bring tampered with.  With a return guarantee if I didn&#x27;t feel like it was authentic, I ordered 3 bottles. I know my YL frankincense and this is authentic. Glad I found it.</li>

    <li> Love this product.  Cleared my elbows--- doctors could never seem to have the answer.  Started using very diligently for&lt;br /&gt;approximately three weeks. It has cleared up took two bottles.  Sounds expensive but I have spent for several years never&lt;br /&gt;any results.  My niece told me about the product.  Works great!!!!  Do not purchase the cheaper oils made out of USA&lt;br /&gt;not the same!!!  This is a great product for insect bites etc.</li>
