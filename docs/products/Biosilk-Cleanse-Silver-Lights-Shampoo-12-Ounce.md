      <li>It works very well.</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t tell much difference in my hair.  </li>
      <li>Thanks,  Cheryl Denton</li>
      <li>Maybe because I let so much gray grow out this time, but still....</li>
      <li>but it makes your hair feel very brittle since it does strip color.</li>
      <li>I would give it 5 stars but it is very drying.</li>

      <li>My hair turns brassy after 6 weeks or so post high</li>
      <li>Which normal shampoo can do over time.  </li>
      <li>and it made my orange locks change to blonde to an icy blonde that I loved.</li>

      <li>Needed my blonde to really shine and biosilk worked wonders!</li>
      <li>This is the first and only purple/blue shampoo I have ever used.</li>
      <li>This is by far...</li>
      <li>I have highlighted hair and it keeps my blonde looking fresh and not yellow brassy.</li>
      <li>My wife and I were surprised at how much of a difference the shampoo actually made over traditional shampoos I had used.</li>
      <li>It really cleans without any dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
      <li>Other than the slight brittleness and a wee bit difficult to brush your hair after, your hair feels good and copper free.</li>
      <li>Apparently this product is known to trigger allergic reactions.</li>
      <li>After shampooing or if its dry, you can comb in Biosilk on the stubborn areas and leave it in for 20 minutes; rinse and dry as normal.</li>
      <li>The shampoo by itself is very nourishing for dry damaged hair due to getting gray or from dying your hair regularly.</li>

<li> Keeps naturally grey hair shiny and stops them from looking yellow.</li>
<li> It still feels very dry when I use it.</li>
<li> It took about one week to get rid of the orange and 2 weeks to get it icy.</li>
<li> I bought this shampoo based on other reviews.</li>
<li> I have not tried other brands for gray hair</li>

<li> Got out of the shower with a rash across my scalp, forehead and down on to chest and shoulders where the suds had come in contact with my skin.</li>
<li> This make it less manageable  </li>
<li> negative, do not use every day and leave in a long time or your hair will look purple and your scalp too.</li>
<li> Used this as directed and head began itching within a few minutes of applying.</li>
<li> I wish I could use it everyday</li>
<li> My few &amp;#34;gray&amp;#34</li>
<li> Unfortunately, the companion conditioner leaves my hair over-conditioned but I like the results of the shampoo enough to deal with the dryness.</li>
<li> but it DOES keep dull white/gray hair from looking dingy.  </li>
<li> I do not have hard water and just had my water softener serviced.  </li>
<li> Again another product not only not worth the money...but terrible for use on your hair.</li>
<li> The company sent me the wrong shampoo....</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m very disappointed in the results.</li>

    <li> This is a very nice shampoo, leaves a nice sheen on my hair and hightlights the \\&quot;silver streaks \\&quot; Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> My mom has nice salt and pepper colored hair, and always gets complements to her hair color.  She does not dye her hair, but this shampoo adds vibrancy to her highlights.</li>
    <li> Lots of suds and very concentrated so bottle should last through many shampoos.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have highlighted hair and it keeps my blonde looking fresh and not yellow brassy. Which normal shampoo can do over time.  I&#x27;m glad I found this vendor on Amazon because in the salon you will pay $25 for this shampoo. Thanks so much came super fast too!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo based on other reviews. As my hair grays it is becoming coarser. This make it less manageable  My wife and I were surprised at how much of a difference the shampoo actually made over traditional shampoos I had used. I have not tried other brands for gray hair but this product works well so I don&#x27;t see a need too.</li>
    <li> Warning! Used this as directed and head began itching within a few minutes of applying. Got out of the shower with a rash across my scalp, forehead and down on to chest and shoulders where the suds had come in contact with my skin. Apparently this product is known to trigger allergic reactions.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t tell much difference in my hair.  My few &amp;#34;gray&amp;#34; hair strands don&#x27;t look any different.  If I had more yellow in the gray, perhaps it would show up more with hightlights</li>
    <li> I was looking for a shampoo that would make silver and blonde hair shine but, not be so drying. It still feels very dry when I use it. It lathers nicely, has a pleasant scent and makes my fair shiny</li>
    <li> I tried expensive and inexpensive shampoos for my grey hair and like this one the best. Unfortunately it is not easy to find, so I am happy to find in on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The first time I purchased this shampoo I loved it. My hair was so shiny and silky and I got lots of compliments. Fast forward a year or so and I&#x27;m very disappointed in the results. My hair feels drier and doesn&#x27;t have the sheen. Maybe because I let so much gray grow out this time, but still....it&#x27;s suppose to BE for gray, silver and blonde hair. Perhaps the formula has changed, perhaps the change is my hair. Whatever, I won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It made my hair smell great, it&#x27;s an awesome purple color and it made my orange locks change to blonde to an icy blonde that I loved. I wish I could use it everyday but it makes your hair feel very brittle since it does strip color. Other than the slight brittleness and a wee bit difficult to brush your hair after, your hair feels good and copper free. It took about one week to get rid of the orange and 2 weeks to get it icy.</li>
    <li> Unable to readily purchase over-the-counter, I reverted to the Biosilk website........voila, easy as could be.  With postage the cost was the same but WITHOUT the hassel of driving to the store(s) and being told they were out of stock.</li>
    <li> The shampoo claimed to remove the yellow build up I have in my white hair, which it has not done.  I do not have hard water and just had my water softener serviced.  Still looking for the right shampoo.</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous for highlighted hair! Hair actually sparkles&lt;br /&gt;and is so manageable. It really cleans without any dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;Best I have ever used.  I love Biosilk hairspray also!</li>
    <li> As strictly a shampoo not any better or worse than any other but it DOES keep dull white/gray hair from looking dingy.  Gives hair just enough a boost to make it look whiter which is nice.</li>
    <li> Again another product not only not worth the money...but terrible for use on your hair. You should be ashamed to recommend it.</li>
    <li> Turns your fingernails blue but make your hair nice and silvery</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. It works very well. I just wish it was easier to find.</li>
    <li> The company sent me the wrong shampoo....I did order this formula but received another formula.  I did use it as it was the&lt;br /&gt;only shampoo that I had at the moment.  I do need the Silver Lights for my hair.  Thanks,  Cheryl Denton</li>
    <li> I have always loved this shampoo, it works well for keeping blonde bright. It&#x27;s awesome for removing brassy tones or weird tones caused by sun exposure.</li>
    <li> If you have gray hair that has a yellow sheen, this product is a must! The shampoo by itself is very nourishing for dry damaged hair due to getting gray or from dying your hair regularly. The blueing shampoo hide the yellow and gives your hair a beautiful silky glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two places that i have stubborn yellowing, in the back and my bangs. After shampooing or if its dry, you can comb in Biosilk on the stubborn areas and leave it in for 20 minutes; rinse and dry as normal. It work fantastic!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative, do not use every day and leave in a long time or your hair will look purple and your scalp too.</li>
    <li> This is by far... the best shampoo silver in the market its keep you hair soft &amp; healthy (not like the others and i try so many )&lt;br /&gt;&amp; its salt free so what else can we ask . do not think twice THIS IS THE ONE!!</li>
    <li> Product is everything it claims to be, lathers up and rinses well. It neutralizes any yellowish tinges in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend caution in handling product as it is a deep blue/purple liquid and can stain clothing - does not stain my skin.</li>
    <li> Needed my blonde to really shine and biosilk worked wonders! Keeps my blonde last longer between salon trips!</li>
    <li> This is a great twice or three times per week shampoo for my silver hair.  It makes it look wonderful</li>
    <li> i did not see any difference in my hair color by using this product.  Would not purchase again, price and delivery was OK.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo for silver lights... I tried a couple more as I couldn&#x27;t find it in the store and the results,  incomparable!  This shampoo takes any orange out of my hair!  I use it only once every 2 weeks and I always get complimented people thinking I added more lights or did something different to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to any blondes that like the touch of silver.</li>
    <li> Great suds- makes your hair really FEEL clean.  The silver does help with my blonde highlights.  My hair turns brassy after 6 weeks or so post high lights- I use this shampoo once a week to control the reds/brassy color.  I leave it on for 5 minutes or so- then rinse!</li>
    <li> Keeps naturally grey hair shiny and stops them from looking yellow.</li>
    <li> My hair is about 50% white and tends to yellow. This is the first and only purple/blue shampoo I have ever used. If I leave it on for 3+ minutes my hair is noticeably whiter/brighter. I would give it 5 stars but it is very drying. Unfortunately, the companion conditioner leaves my hair over-conditioned but I like the results of the shampoo enough to deal with the dryness.</li>
    <li> It cleans and doesn&#x27;t feel bad but the price is a little more than I would pay for what it does.</li>
