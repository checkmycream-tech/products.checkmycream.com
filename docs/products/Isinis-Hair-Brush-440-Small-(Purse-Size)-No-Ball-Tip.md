      <li>It&#x27;s a lot to pay for a brush, but it is worth it, just take good care of it</li>
      <li>being said, I love the brush and will continue to use it.</li>
      <li>Fine hair that breaks easily is easily managed with these brushes.</li>

      <li>Thankfully, I was able to choose my color (lavender) and at first I thought that the salon owner was just trying to sell me something.</li>
      <li>They work great on a wig and are small and easy to handle.  </li>
      <li>Excellent brush for fine difficult to detangle hair.</li>
      <li>After five local stores with no resultes, I found these brushes at a good price and fast service.  </li>
      <li>My only wish is that the handle was longer/larger for a more comfortable grip.</li>
      <li>I have ultra fine hair and a lot of it - I am 27, and I have been using these Isinis brushes for 27 years, and my older siblings and mother have used them for longer than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>That is right, the brush broke in two pieces.</li>
      <li>Brush arrive promptly and was exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t pretty, but I still used it some.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>I was very surprise when my brush go here so FAST and  </li>
      <li>thanks, charlotte hughes[[ASIN:</li>
      <li>Especially if you have fine hair, it does not pull like most other brushes.</li>
      <li>If you have curly or very thick hair, you will probably not find this brush very effective.</li>
      <li>Other than being a putrid color the brush is fabulous!</li>
      <li>I have fine and thin hair, and this brush eliminates tangles gently and does not cause static problems.</li>
      <li>Time for a new order!</li>
      <li>Unfortunately after many many years of use, mine broke.  </li>
      <li>I have used this brush since High School.</li>
      <li>I love these brushes, they last a long time.  </li>
      <li>use this brush in the shower on wet hair (with Honest Conditioning Detangling Spray) and also on dry hair.</li>
      <li>To be honest, I&#x27;m going to try going to a beauty supply company to try to find a similar slightly larger brush because I cannot afford to keep paying $30 for a single brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The bristles are strong and a bit prickly on the end (no rubber ball), with just a little give.</li>
      <li>I like how it evenly distributes the hair&#x27;s oils throughout the hair and makes my hair extremely soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t hear a peep out of my 7 year old daughter.  </li>
      <li>I plan for these brushes to take me from childhood to old age.</li>
      <li>Perfect for thick or thin hair</li>
      <li>No other brush compares.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered some more of these and hope to get something other than the icky yellow, but my hair doesn&#x27;t know whether the brush is ugly or beautiful.</li>

<li> I still loose hair but not as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s so gentle that she just stands there and let&#x27;s me finish her hairstyle without the tiniest complaint!  </li>
<li> have lost of forgotten my brush on trips before, and I have used a variety of other brushed through the dark days before amazon.</li>
<li> This brush is a god send if you have a little girl that complains about having her hair brushed.  </li>
<li> or it wouldn&#x27;t be available for purchase, but it is an ugly yellow.</li>
<li> I had one that half the back had broken off of, and when I went to get a new one, I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere.</li>
<li> and they are extremely durable.</li>
<li> It takes a little longer to brush her hair (not much) but it doesn&#x27;t rip her hair out</li>
<li> Only complaint......</li>
<li> I still have my old broken one from the 70s.</li>
<li> I have extremely thick and frizzy/curly long hair.</li>
<li> (I used to have one of these as a little girl).</li>
<li> I had planned on buying a few for relatives as gifts, but will not be doing that.</li>
<li> B000N39870 Isinis Hair Brush # 440 Small (Purse Size)</li>
<li> I tried a Wet Brush-- it was no better on wet hair than Isinis and that horrible smell made it unusable anyway!</li>
<li> I figure if it breaks, no great loss, but it keeps hanging in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> After five local stores with no resultes, I found these brushes at a good price and fast service.  Thanks Amazon, you seem to alway come through on hard to find items.</li>
    <li> I have been a hairdresser for over thirty years. I have done hair on stage for several well known products. My specialty is long beautiful, arranged in glamour up-do&#x27;s. Fine hair that breaks easily is easily managed with these brushes. Do not use the brushes with balls on the tips. You will find that your hair has split ends from breaking off with that type of brush. These isinis brushes are the best for fine hair, to keep it healthy. thanks, charlotte hughes[[ASIN:B000N39870 Isinis Hair Brush # 440 Small (Purse Size) No Ball Tip]]</li>
    <li> This brush has lasted 15 years and I continue to get extras.  I have bought them for tender headed granddaughters and they call this brush my \\&quot;Magic Brush\\&quot;.  So I have bought all of them one and bought the larger type for a long haired child.  They say the brush does not hurt.  I recommend this brush and would pay the asking price everytime!</li>
    <li> This brush is a god send if you have a little girl that complains about having her hair brushed.  Now that I use this brush I don&#x27;t hear a peep out of my 7 year old daughter.  It takes a little longer to brush her hair (not much) but it doesn&#x27;t rip her hair out and it&#x27;s so gentle that she just stands there and let&#x27;s me finish her hairstyle without the tiniest complaint!  I love it!</li>
    <li> I am in my 40&#x27;s now and have fine blond wavy hair that is thinning. The amount of hair that has been left in my brushes and comb has been concerning. So I decided to try a different brush and detangling spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to buy this brush because of the size/price. I don&#x27;t regret the purchase. Instead of dreading brushing my hair, it is now a pleasure. Just start from the bottom and work upward and take your time. I still loose hair but not as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this brush in the shower on wet hair (with Honest Conditioning Detangling Spray) and also on dry hair. My only wish is that the handle was longer/larger for a more comfortable grip. To be honest, I&#x27;m going to try going to a beauty supply company to try to find a similar slightly larger brush because I cannot afford to keep paying $30 for a single brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I love the brush and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Other than being a putrid color the brush is fabulous! I know someone would like this color or it wouldn&#x27;t be available for purchase, but it is an ugly yellow. I&#x27;ve ordered some more of these and hope to get something other than the icky yellow, but my hair doesn&#x27;t know whether the brush is ugly or beautiful. And it works for me!</li>
    <li> I have ultra fine hair and a lot of it - I am 27, and I have been using these Isinis brushes for 27 years, and my older siblings and mother have used them for longer than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have lost of forgotten my brush on trips before, and I have used a variety of other brushed through the dark days before amazon. Back then my mother and I had to find a stylist who knew where they could buy the brush and get it for us (because it was always at a store that you had to be a licensed hair stylist to purchase from). In the meantime I tried to all sorts of combs and brushes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;believe me you will never find a better brush. never ever</li>
    <li> I have used this brush since High School. I am now 55! No other brush compares. Especially if you have fine hair, it does not pull like most other brushes. Plus, they are long lasting. I am somewhat embarrassed to say, my last ones lasted about 24 years. Time for a new order!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these brushes for over 15 years. I have fine and thin hair, and this brush eliminates tangles gently and does not cause static problems. I am lost without it!</li>
    <li> Best brush ever for baby fine hair.  My daughter (4) does not cry or complain when I use Isinis Hair Brush on her baby fine hair.  Keeps her hair tangle free.  Happy kid &#x3D; Happy Mom.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lot to pay for a brush, but it is worth it, just take good care of it and it will last for years and years (I used to have one of these as a little girl). I have straight, fine hair, and the brush really makes my hair shine and my scalp feel great, without breaking any hairs. The bristles are strong and a bit prickly on the end (no rubber ball), with just a little give. The only small downside to this particular model is that the plastic handle feels a little abrasive where the two halves meet. If you have curly or very thick hair, you will probably not find this brush very effective.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, they last a long time.  Unfortunately after many many years of use, mine broke.  I purchased and received the brush in a timely manner.  I&#x27;m satisfied with that.  Only complaint......you can&#x27;t pick the color of your brush.  I&#x27;m a guy....I like manly colors....they sent me a baby-pink brush.  Lol  I&#x27;m cool with it though, function over looks. :)&lt;br /&gt;I still recommend this brush to my family and friends...even the most manly ones. Lol</li>
    <li> Excellent brush for fine difficult to detangle hair. A must have for the girls in my family. We&#x27;ve tried others and none are able to detangle like the ISNIs synthetics.</li>
    <li> Brush arrive promptly and was exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> This is the second brush I have purchased.  They work great on a wig and are small and easy to handle.  The vendor did a great job of packaging and delivery.</li>
    <li> Everyone I knew in my younger years (1960s and 70s) used these brushes, and they were the best. I had one that half the back had broken off of, and when I went to get a new one, I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere. It wasn&#x27;t pretty, but I still used it some. I couldn&#x27;t find them for several years and moved on to Mason Pearson, after trying several others that just didn&#x27;t work. I wound up getting three different Mason Pearsons trying to find the correct size/type. They were pricey, but the closest approximation I could find. I was thrilled to find these again on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always go to this brush instead of the Mason Pearsons. Every now and then I pull them out to compare and am always amazed that this brush is so much better than those expensive brushes. The bright colors are cheery. I tried a Wet Brush-- it was no better on wet hair than Isinis and that horrible smell made it unusable anyway! I still have my old broken one from the 70s. I throw it in my suitcase for travel. I figure if it breaks, no great loss, but it keeps hanging in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I found these no ball tip versions, I bought a ball tip version because that was all I could find. This version is so much better. I have bought several, in case I can&#x27;t find them again someday. I plan for these brushes to take me from childhood to old age.</li>
    <li> I had never heard of this brand of brush before and got one today at my salon. Thankfully, I was able to choose my color (lavender) and at first I thought that the salon owner was just trying to sell me something. This is literally the best brush that I have ever owned. She told me that she has had one for 20+ years and they are extremely durable. I like how it evenly distributes the hair&#x27;s oils throughout the hair and makes my hair extremely soft and shiny. I will probably never buy another dollar store brush and will stick to this brand for now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update- 7/21/2016&lt;br /&gt;I have had this brush for a while now. I had planned on buying a few for relatives as gifts, but will not be doing that. I have extremely thick and frizzy/curly long hair. I went to simply brush my hair yesterday and the handle broke off in my hand. That is right, the brush broke in two pieces. I was shocked, as I have always taken really good care of this brush and have had no problems. Therefore, I have removed 2 stars from my original &amp;#34;5 star&amp;#34; review.</li>
    <li> I was very surprise when my brush go here so FAST and  in  favorite color and the description was perfect.  thanks</li>
    <li> I love these hair brushes. Perfect for thick or thin hair and they do not get tangled up in your hair. Also perfect size for your handbag!</li>
