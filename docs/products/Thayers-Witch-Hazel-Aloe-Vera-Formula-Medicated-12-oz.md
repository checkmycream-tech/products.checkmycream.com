      <li>This stuff is great!  </li>
      <li>A wonderful product</li>
      <li>It is very pleasant to the skin, no burning sensation at all (like it happens with alcohol-based aftershaves).</li>

      <li>I like this product a great deal.</li>

      <li>It takes away the irritation and it feels so good after</li>
      <li>Thayers makes the absolutely best witch hazel available.</li>
      <li>Thayers Medicated Superhazel with Aloe Vera, however, smells great (we like the Rose Petal scent, too.)  </li>
      <li>It is still a good Thayers product, just not 100% witch hazel like the rest.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>This make a nice aftershave.  </li>
      <li>The alcohol is great to clean any nicks I might have made and the aloe moisturizes my face.</li>
      <li>Mostly it&#x27;s because it has a very nice menthol chill complemented by a strong peppermint scent.  </li>
      <li>Turns out, buying it online was easy and a lot cheaper!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too strong to me to use !</li>
      <li>It worked great, but smelled funny.  </li>
      <li>most days.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love the way this makes my skin feel.  </li>
      <li>Love this Witch Hazel</li>
      <li>We leave it out on the bathroom sink - several friends have started ordering it, too - it really is an awesome product!</li>
      <li>This Medicated Superhazel version of the Thayers&#x27; product line is my favorite.</li>
      <li>I love this WH.</li>
      <li>you will love this version.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, you will love their alcohol free stuff.</li>
      <li>This product is very good for removing facial grime and freshening up the face.  </li>
      <li>I prefer a refreshing splash on my face in the morning and the Superhazel provides a clean and minty smell.</li>
      <li>you are in the mood for a really strong cooling affect</li>
      <li>It maintains the gentleness of the witchhazel line but with just a bit extra of the good antiseptic stuff and a nice blend of the aloe.</li>
      <li>I feel as though it does the job, but the stinging feeling is a huge turn off.</li>
      <li>I was using the alcohol-free Cucumber Toner as aftershave and enjoyed the gentle serum, but it smelled a bit like was more .</li>
      <li>glad I can get the product over here in the UK as well, thanks to amazon!</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin clean and tingly, but not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>It leaves a nice cooling effect, and fresh smell on my newly shaven face.</li>
      <li>Our whole family uses it for facial toner, plus it works great for mosquito bites.  </li>
      <li>Has a mild menthol clove smell which doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
      <li>It has a bit more of the food grade alcohol, which makes it ideal for both minor first aid and general hygiene purposes.</li>
      <li>Finally was able to find it again here!</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;and have had some success.  </li>
      <li>This is an incredibly useful product for skin care of all types.</li>
      <li>, just right.  </li>
      <li>Super Hazel is so much better than regular Hazel.</li>
      <li>This is very gentle on the skin.  </li>
      <li>My redness actually becomes more severe.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t very like!</li>
      <li>but Thayers also makes alcohol free products for those with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>You can put it on just about any itchy bug bite, razor burn, and it seems to do nothing at first.</li>
      <li>I will definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
      <li>I tried this the first time and was hooked.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s nice to use in other way!</li>
      <li>Honestly, I never knew my face could feel this good after applying this as an after-shave for my face.</li>
      <li>has clearly has 150+ years to get their blends just right.</li>
      <li>it cleans without drying and is a great price you only need a small amount on a cotton pad.</li>
      <li>The burn is not bad and will only burn if you are too aggressive shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I have fairly sensitive skin, and had tried many other products before.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This really helped my grandson face clear up from pimples.</li>
      <li>I believe it has a very masculine smell, as it is infused with both menthol and clove.</li>
      <li>Facefeel after dry down is good, not tacky and not dry</li>
      <li>The menthol is a nice touch, the bottle is a bit small but its going to be a staple in the future!!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff and it has been harder and harder to find in stores.</li>
      <li>I really feel like this is the only product out there that removes all the makeup and dirt from your skin without drying it out!</li>
      <li>I guess I&#x27;m just sensitive.</li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I used this product every day for about a month and finally developed hives and a rash under my arms.</li>
      <li>Long time Thayers customer, first time Superhazel user.</li>
      <li>could feel a bit more drying the original witch hazel w aloe Vera of the same brand though works just as well if not better!!!</li>

<li> I wet shave daily and used witch hazel</li>

<li> From a wetshaving perspective, removing the alcohol is actually a negative and because of this I use the witch hazel astringent.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, it also has&lt;br /&gt;some alcohol in it, which prompts me to give it four stars and not five.  </li>
<li> I use a DE razor to shave and this product helps with the aftereffects of my sometimes haphazard shave job.</li>
<li> the stinging was crazy.  </li>
<li> I have also been using it for cold sores</li>
<li> Anyone whose ever dealt with that stuff knows how bad it will make you itch.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Was an order for my Mom and this is what she said &amp;#34;The only stuff that works on my head to stop the itching, and I can&#x27;t find it anywhere!&amp;#34; Thank you Amazon for having it!!!</li>
    <li> I remember using witch hazel when I was growing up.  It worked great, but smelled funny.  Thayers Medicated Superhazel with Aloe Vera, however, smells great (we like the Rose Petal scent, too.)  This is very gentle on the skin.  Our whole family uses it for facial toner, plus it works great for mosquito bites.  We leave it out on the bathroom sink - several friends have started ordering it, too - it really is an awesome product!</li>
    <li> This product is very good for removing facial grime and freshening up the face.  Unfortunately, it also has&lt;br /&gt;some alcohol in it, which prompts me to give it four stars and not five.  I have also been using it for cold sores&lt;br /&gt;and have had some success.  It is still a good Thayers product, just not 100% witch hazel like the rest.</li>
    <li> Super Hazel is so much better than regular Hazel.</li>
    <li> Love it! I use it on my underarms every morning after showering and every night before going to sleep and I haven&#x27;t had to wear deodorant since I started doing this. Also a good toner on my pimply nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I used this product every day for about a month and finally developed hives and a rash under my arms. I had to stop using it as a deodorant. I still like it as an occasional astringent for my face, but I&#x27;ll refrain from using it every day. And from what I&#x27;ve heard from others, this doesn&#x27;t happen to every one. I guess I&#x27;m just sensitive.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product as an aftershave replacement for over 10 years now, after I discovered it at a \\&quot;Restauration Hardware\\&quot; store in California. It is very pleasant to the skin, no burning sensation at all (like it happens with alcohol-based aftershaves). I have fairly sensitive skin, and had tried many other products before.&lt;br /&gt;So glad I can get the product over here in the UK as well, thanks to amazon!</li>
    <li> I use this after my shave, bug bites, and a rash i had. It takes away the irritation and it feels so good after</li>
    <li> excellent astringent.  Great smell.</li>
    <li> Just be advised that this version of Thayers is STRONG.&lt;br /&gt;If you are in the mood for a really strong cooling affect you will love this version.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, you will love their alcohol free stuff. It is all great!</li>
    <li> Love this Witch Hazel</li>
    <li> The menthol is a nice touch, the bottle is a bit small but its going to be a staple in the future!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this from a local health food store for years now.  It&#x27;s strange stuff but it works. You can put it on just about any itchy bug bite, razor burn, and it seems to do nothing at first. A few minutes later you realize the irritation is just gone.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t last all day so you need to reapply now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My job exposes me to fiberglass insulation from time to time. Anyone whose ever dealt with that stuff knows how bad it will make you itch. I keep some in a spray bottle in my work truck to take care of that until I can get home.</li>
    <li> Long time Thayers customer, first time Superhazel user. After years of hunting and failed attempts, I have finally found the last aftershave I will ever need.  This product is perfect is every way for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thayer has clearly has 150+ years to get their blends just right. I am not a paid spokes person or anything  BTW. I was using the alcohol-free Cucumber Toner as aftershave and enjoyed the gentle serum, but it smelled a bit like was more . I prefer a refreshing splash on my face in the morning and the Superhazel provides a clean and minty smell. The alcohol is great to clean any nicks I might have made and the aloe moisturizes my face. There are other goodies such as: clove, camphor and peppermint oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This day in age I just want a product to perform as advertised and use quality ingredients. Thank you Thayers for making the Superhazel, I will be a life long user. Great name too!</li>
    <li> This really helped my grandson face clear up from pimples. A wonderful product</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s supposed to sooth but I find myself still allergic to it a bit. My redness actually becomes more severe.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  it cleans without drying and is a great price you only need a small amount on a cotton pad.</li>
    <li> I wet shave daily and used witch hazel most days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, know that toner does not equal astringent.  The process of distilling witch hazel produces alcohol.  Removing this alcohol produces the toner.  From a wetshaving perspective, removing the alcohol is actually a negative and because of this I use the witch hazel astringent.  The burn is not bad and will only burn if you are too aggressive shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the review.  I like the Superhazel...a lot.  Mostly it&#x27;s because it has a very nice menthol chill complemented by a strong peppermint scent.  Facefeel after dry down is good, not tacky and not dry, just right.  Before using the superhazel, I used the cucumber toner and found no added benefit to my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I tried this the first time and was hooked. Finally was able to find it again here! I really feel like this is the only product out there that removes all the makeup and dirt from your skin without drying it out!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and it has been harder and harder to find in stores. Turns out, buying it online was easy and a lot cheaper!</li>
    <li> Honestly, I never knew my face could feel this good after applying this as an after-shave for my face. I&#x27;ve never felt the need to use after-shave but figured I would try it out after reading a review on some website. I will definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
    <li> This make a nice aftershave.  Helps razorburn and has less alcohol to burn you than the actual thayer&#x27;s aftershave product.  Has a mild menthol clove smell which doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
    <li> I love this WH. It leaves a nice cooling effect, and fresh smell on my newly shaven face. I also use it on bites and burns, which temporarily relieves the skin. I believe it has a very masculine smell, as it is infused with both menthol and clove.</li>
    <li> This is an incredibly useful product for skin care of all types. Thayers makes the absolutely best witch hazel available.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know who would use this as burn relief because my god does this STING!  I had a tiny cut and used this and OUCH OUCH OUCH the stinging was crazy.  I would NOT use this for burns, that pain must be unbearable.  I feel as though it does the job, but the stinging feeling is a huge turn off.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too strong to me to use ! I don&#x27;t very like! My skin doesn&#x27;t feel good with it! But it&#x27;s nice to use in other way!</li>
    <li> I shave my head and I use Thayers to help control bumps. Works great, very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I like this product a great deal. I use a DE razor to shave and this product helps with the aftereffects of my sometimes haphazard shave job. This product does have alcohol in it but Thayers also makes alcohol free products for those with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Feels great!! Especially for people. Who use as toner the peppermint feels awesome could feel a bit more drying the original witch hazel w aloe Vera of the same brand though works just as well if not better!!!</li>
    <li> Pro:  The smell is wonderful.  It is a mixture of mint and cloves.&lt;br /&gt;Con:  It leaves a sticky residue on your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The con is big enough that I won&#x27;t be purchasing again unfortunately.</li>
    <li> Love the way this makes my skin feel.  Not too dry or tight feeling.  The fragrance reminds me of Bactine.  It leaves my skin clean and tingly, but not overpowering.  Very happy and would buy again.</li>
    <li> This Medicated Superhazel version of the Thayers&#x27; product line is my favorite. It has a bit more of the food grade alcohol, which makes it ideal for both minor first aid and general hygiene purposes. It maintains the gentleness of the witchhazel line but with just a bit extra of the good antiseptic stuff and a nice blend of the aloe. An of course, the Thayers brand is synonymous with quality. Highly recommended.</li>
