      <li>I plan on using this product for 6 more weeks.  </li>
      <li>make sure you wash linens, etc.</li>
      <li>More to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been purchasing more ever since.</li>
      <li>So glad to find these wipes with tea tree oil.  </li>
      <li>great stuff--very good for dry eyes.</li>
      <li>Best solution for my dry eye ever!</li>
      <li>A quick wipe across the eyelid, another across the eyebrow, and then a wipe on my cheeks, nose, and forehead, and my rosacea is noticeably better.  </li>
      <li>There has been a huge improvement of my blepheritis.</li>
      <li>Keeps eyes free from styes.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>this product does an excellent cleaning job without leaving any residue behind and leaves the eyelids with a refreshing feeling</li>
      <li>a discount; this is full price.</li>
      <li>WORTH IT.</li>
      <li>Documentation doesn&#x27;t say if rinsing right after will help the sting or hurt effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After the first few days, I began to really look forward to using these wipes because my eyes felt so great.</li>
      <li>Have used the product consistently morning and night for seven days now.</li>
      <li>Does exactly as advertised.  </li>
      <li>and he said my eyelids have improved amazingly after using only 1 box of the pads so far!  </li>
      <li>This product is strong but it feels terrific to use on your face and eye lids.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve never used tea tree oil before, be prepared - it&#x27;s rather intense.</li>
      <li>For some reason, they were only available online.</li>
      <li>My eye dr. told me to get Cliradex to clean my eyelids because I have a couple of specific eye problems.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without them!</li>
      <li>My eyes will get red and burn sometimes, but it is SO MUCH BETTER than what I lived with prior to using these eye wipes.</li>
      <li>They have helped manage my stinging, very red eyes since using them the very first time.</li>
      <li>Priced too high.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>With the first use, my eyes burned a lot, but after this initial time, the burning sensation lessened substantially.</li>
      <li>The sensation is bearable, but do keep the eyes closed for the full minute after application.</li>
      <li>Looked all over for wipes that contained the natural ingredient of tea tree oil.</li>
      <li>I have no idea if it did what it was supposed to as far as the mites around the eyelashes (not even the mites, but the bacteria on the mites is apparently the issue).</li>
      <li>They are pricey, but I consider this item to be comparable to buying any necessary medication, so I will live with the cost.</li>
      <li>this really works long term, I will come back and up this to 5 stars.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Somewhere along the line, several years ago, I developed severe eye crust in the mornings.</li>
      <li>My eyelashes are starting to grow back and my lash line is completely clear says my doctor.  </li>

<li> Work fine but too expensive.</li>
<li> I will have to come back later and provide a follow up for this product since I have only been using it for a few days.</li>
<li> dry eyes.</li>
<li> It was the same type of &amp;#34;stinging&amp;#34;, but it doesn&#x27;t last but a few seconds.&lt;br</li>
<li> Strips can be cut in half and bagged for double the uses.</li>
<li> recommended by Optimitrist for cleansing and getting eye lids healthy and moist.... :(</li>
<li> I wish they were less expensive, but they do really help!</li>
<li> Cannot tell that it really helps, and it&#x27;s plenty expensive for an iffy product.</li>
<li> It burns a little.</li>
<li> I have not been diagnosed with demodex, but did have what I considered to be an excess of debris at the base of the lashes, redness on the upper lids, dry and burning sensations, all of which have been considerably improved after one week.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s the only game in town</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just been a few days, but I think maybe I am sensing some improvement.</li>
<li> There is a significant improvement in the visible appearance of the base of the eyelashes.</li>
<li> Personally, I am into the intensity since I think it will take some burning to wipe out these creepy little worm bastards from my eyelash</li>
<li> I believe it was from Zoloft use, at least it seemed to start about the time I began taking Zoloft.</li>
<li> /&gt;maybe at least 4 to  6 months to complete&lt;br /&gt;the treatment.</li>
<li> At least on MY eyelids it does.</li>
<li> It occurred to me that it might be the result of demodex folliculorum or some other creepy crawler.</li>
<li> The redness was reduced by at least 70% with ONE USE!</li>
<li> It does have a sting to the skin, but cold water cools it down.  </li>
<li> I was a little afraid to try them because people said when you use the pads that there is a stinging feeling.  </li>
<li> If it does not work at all, then the ranking will get decreased.</li>
<li> A bit too expensive</li>
<li> They are a bit expensive.</li>
<li> so it is a bit expensive.</li>
<li> I found I like the smell of the Cliradex pads, and the &amp;#34;stinging&amp;#34; reminded me of using Vick&#x27;s Vaporub as a kid when I had a cold.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Anyway, once I read this I thought maybe I could get rid of or reduce some of this eye crust which is highly annoying.</li>
<li> My eye doctor recommended these for dermatitis at the base of the eyelashes.</li>
<li> I had a terrible case of blephoritis (itchy, scratchy eyelids) and this took care of it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Doctor recommended. This product does what it says if you follow the directions.</li>
    <li> My eye doctor recommended these for dermatitis at the base of the eyelashes. For some reason, they were only available online. They started helping almost immediately, and I&#x27;ve gotten used to the stinging sensation that the wipes temporarily produce. I went back to the eye doc for a followup yesterday and he said that things have greatly improved. There&#x27;s no substitute for tea tree oil. Thank God!</li>
    <li> great stuff--very good for dry eyes. Recommended by an eye surgeon to us</li>
    <li> Came in the mail swiftly. Product did as advertised.</li>
    <li> love it, but expensive...</li>
    <li> Keeps eyes free from styes. Eye doctor suggests I use it. Very happy with this product. The best thing is that it works!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without them! Best solution for my dry eye ever!</li>
    <li> Have used the product consistently morning and night for seven days now. There is a significant improvement in the visible appearance of the base of the eyelashes. Strips can be cut in half and bagged for double the uses. The sensation is bearable, but do keep the eyes closed for the full minute after application. Have treated the rest of the face with Body Shop tea tree oil face wash and toner. I have not been diagnosed with demodex, but did have what I considered to be an excess of debris at the base of the lashes, redness on the upper lids, dry and burning sensations, all of which have been considerably improved after one week.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never used tea tree oil before, be prepared - it&#x27;s rather intense. I was told to use these by my eye doctor - I have no idea if it did what it was supposed to as far as the mites around the eyelashes (not even the mites, but the bacteria on the mites is apparently the issue). But, but, BUT. A quick wipe across the eyelid, another across the eyebrow, and then a wipe on my cheeks, nose, and forehead, and my rosacea is noticeably better.  WORTH IT.</li>
    <li> this product does an excellent cleaning job without leaving any residue behind and leaves the eyelids with a refreshing feeling</li>
    <li> So glad to find these wipes with tea tree oil.  Looked all over for wipes that contained the natural ingredient of tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> I have acute blepharitis.  This stuff severly irritaed my eyes.  Optomologist told me to stop using it.  Irritation stopped.  Would not buy again for this medical condition.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes are starting to grow back and my lash line is completely clear says my doctor.  I plan on using this product for 6 more weeks.  Have been on it 3 weeks now.  It does have a sting to the skin, but cold water cools it down.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Cliradex does a wonderful job of cleaning the eyelids. Helped alleviate itchiness around my eyes</li>
    <li> This product is strong but it feels terrific to use on your face and eye lids.  They are a bit expensive.</li>
    <li> Yes, it stings to use. Documentation doesn&#x27;t say if rinsing right after will help the sting or hurt effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my eye lids tender. Cannot tell that it really helps, and it&#x27;s plenty expensive for an iffy product.</li>
    <li> This works. It burns a little.</li>
    <li> My eye dr. told me to get Cliradex to clean my eyelids because I have a couple of specific eye problems.  I was a little afraid to try them because people said when you use the pads that there is a stinging feeling.  I found I like the smell of the Cliradex pads, and the &amp;#34;stinging&amp;#34; reminded me of using Vick&#x27;s Vaporub as a kid when I had a cold.  It was the same type of &amp;#34;stinging&amp;#34;, but it doesn&#x27;t last but a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went for a return visit to my eye dr. and he said my eyelids have improved amazingly after using only 1 box of the pads so far!  I will continue needing to use them.  I wish they were less expensive, but they do really help!</li>
    <li> seems to have done the trick. it&#x27;s the only game in town so it is a bit expensive. make sure you wash linens, etc. so don&#x27;t get re-infected with demuxed bugs!</li>
    <li> This is wonderful! I had a terrible case of blephoritis (itchy, scratchy eyelids) and this took care of it.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I posted a review for the Cliridex eye scrubs once before. Maybe this is a different company. I have been using these wipes for about 3 months, I think. I use them every morning. They have helped manage my stinging, very red eyes since using them the very first time. With the first use, my eyes burned a lot, but after this initial time, the burning sensation lessened substantially. After the first few days, I began to really look forward to using these wipes because my eyes felt so great. The redness was reduced by at least 70% with ONE USE! My eyes will get red and burn sometimes, but it is SO MUCH BETTER than what I lived with prior to using these eye wipes. I have been purchasing more ever since. They are pricey, but I consider this item to be comparable to buying any necessary medication, so I will live with the cost.</li>
    <li> Does exactly as advertised.  Very happy with the results. A bit too expensive</li>
    <li> I am looking for a Discount Coupon for Claridex.  The only one posted on Amazon is for 84.00 for 2 boxes of 24 each.  This is&lt;br /&gt;not a discount; this is full price. Where can I find a DISCOUNT COUPON FOR this product..  It is over $1.oo per day to use..&lt;br /&gt;and this is too costly for me.  dj</li>
    <li> Good product.  Priced too high.</li>
    <li> recommended by Optimitrist for cleansing and getting eye lids healthy and moist.... :( dry eyes.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for one month.  There has been a huge improvement of my blepheritis. I will be reordering.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I think you need to do this&lt;br /&gt;maybe at least 4 to  6 months to complete&lt;br /&gt;the treatment.</li>
    <li> A must have to use on Demodex !</li>
    <li> Prescription has taken pain away in my eye.</li>
    <li> I will have to come back later and provide a follow up for this product since I have only been using it for a few days. But I will tell my story anyway...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somewhere along the line, several years ago, I developed severe eye crust in the mornings. I believe it was from Zoloft use, at least it seemed to start about the time I began taking Zoloft. But even after 6 years of discontinuing Zoloft I still have the eye crust. It occurred to me that it might be the result of demodex folliculorum or some other creepy crawler. I read a study that showed tea tree oil could kill of these suckers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, once I read this I thought maybe I could get rid of or reduce some of this eye crust which is highly annoying. So I have started using these wipes as well as a facial wash advertised for demodex control. It&#x27;s just been a few days, but I think maybe I am sensing some improvement. More to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: The listing says you might experience a &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; sensation after wiping this stuff on your lids. Well, I am here to tell you it BURNS LIKE A MOFO!!! At least on MY eyelids it does. But it just lasts for seconds and stops as the stuff dries. Personally, I am into the intensity since I think it will take some burning to wipe out these creepy little worm bastards from my eyelash follicles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this really works long term, I will come back and up this to 5 stars. The four stars are a place holder. If it does not work at all, then the ranking will get decreased.</li>
    <li> Work fine but too expensive.</li>
