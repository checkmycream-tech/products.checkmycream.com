<li> I used to use other obagi products with it (toner, moisturizer), but with their prices I went ahead and got a different toner and moisturizer - yet cannot part with the cleanser.</li>
<li> I had very dry, scaley, flakey skin around my eyes mouth and forehead, using this along with the obagi hydrate moisturizer has worked wonders.</li>
<li> This is exactly the same cleanser that I used to buy from my esthetican, but much less expensive.</li>
<li> My only complaint is the cost.</li>
<li> It still cleans well and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but the fragrance is disappointing.</li>
<li> Way too expensive and has really nasty ingredients and chemicals in it.</li>
