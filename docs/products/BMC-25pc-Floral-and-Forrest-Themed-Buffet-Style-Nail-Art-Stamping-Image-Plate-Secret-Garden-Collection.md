      <li>but unless there are some folks with huge gorilla fingers or some kind of nail art</li>
      <li>Oh and god forbid I use a top coat to erase it even more.</li>
      <li>I love the &amp;#34;buffet&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I loved them they are easy to use and look super cute</li>
      <li>Great designs, but would work better with actual stamping nail polish.</li>
      <li>I got these plates because they have huge images on the plates</li>
      <li>Took a few days to arrive, but they are beautiful!</li>
      <li>Overall, very nice</li>

      <li>I have really been enjoying stamping with the Buffet Style plates.</li>
      <li>These are so cute they stamp really well.</li>
      <li>Ugh, I love the designs, they&#x27;re beautiful and I love that they&#x27;re big enough to cover my whole nail.</li>
      <li>They look faded regardless of the nail polish you use or how quickly you stamp.</li>
      <li>Very pretty patterns</li>
      <li>Nice, but not etched as deeply as Pueen.</li>
      <li>The plates are way smaller than I thought they&#x27;d be, but still love them.</li>
      <li>Some images are too big though, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re longer than half an inch and the images are still too big, so that&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>is wasted by many pretty designs that I would love to have used but they are way too big to fit on any style fingernail I have ever seen or would care to use if I knew of.&lt;br /&gt;Was hoping that the plate was smaller than most plates from the online pics but a lot of the art is just way too big or jumbled together too close to the big stuff that you can&#x27;t use to make it worth trying to pull a print easily with general stamp tools.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast though.</li>
      <li>They stamp very well also.</li>
      <li>I have tried some of them and they stamp very well.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t heard of then much of the area on these stamps</li>
      <li>You have to work really fast to get it to transfer.</li>
      <li>Light blue</li>
      <li>But like someone else posted, the engravings aren&#x27;t deep enough to make a good solid stamp.</li>
      <li>Regular seems to dry super fast.</li>
      <li>Some are a little similar, but they&#x27;re mostly plant themed</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of the whole plate designs.</li>
      <li>The designs are so fine , it is hard to stamp</li>

    <li> These were not that great. The designs are so fine , it is hard to stamp</li>
    <li> Great plates! I had tried stamping before and it just wouldn&#x27;t work. I decided to give one more try with these plates and they work amazingly! My favorite is the koi fish plate!</li>
    <li> The plates are way smaller than I thought they&#x27;d be, but still love them. I have long nails. They&#x27;re longer than half an inch and the images are still too big, so that&#x27;s great. I got these plates because they have huge images on the plates and I was afraid that normal images wouldn&#x27;t fit on my nail. Some images are too big though, but that&#x27;s okay. There are some images that I just couldn&#x27;t get to stamp. Like the kitties on one of the plates. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase. It came earlier than expected. Got them in 5 days with a weekend in between. So happy!</li>
    <li> Lots of designs to choose from and looks like they will transfer well. Haven&#x27;t used yet, but will update review when I do.</li>
    <li> These plates are wonderful and print well.</li>
    <li> I loved them they are easy to use and look super cute</li>
    <li> These are so cute they stamp really well. Great price and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Great designs, but would work better with actual stamping nail polish. Regular seems to dry super fast. You have to work really fast to get it to transfer.</li>
    <li> Nice, but not etched as deeply as Pueen. Some of the patterns were a little small, especially if you want to cover the entire nail with a single pattern. Overall, very nice and I will purchase BMC in the future if there are patterns I want.</li>
    <li> Very pretty patterns but unless there are some folks with huge gorilla fingers or some kind of nail art I haven&#x27;t heard of then much of the area on these stamps is wasted by many pretty designs that I would love to have used but they are way too big to fit on any style fingernail I have ever seen or would care to use if I knew of.&lt;br /&gt;Was hoping that the plate was smaller than most plates from the online pics but a lot of the art is just way too big or jumbled together too close to the big stuff that you can&#x27;t use to make it worth trying to pull a print easily with general stamp tools.

    <li> I have really been enjoying stamping with the Buffet Style plates. I&#x27;m a big fan of the whole plate designs. The designs are beautiful and the use of them is endless. They stamp very well also.</li>
    <li> Got these plates to add to all the rest of my Bundle Monster plate collection. I have tried some of them and they stamp very well.</li>
    <li> I Love bundle monster plates!</li>
    <li> Ugh, I love the designs, they&#x27;re beautiful and I love that they&#x27;re big enough to cover my whole nail. But like someone else posted, the engravings aren&#x27;t deep enough to make a good solid stamp. They look faded regardless of the nail polish you use or how quickly you stamp. I&#x27;m really disappointed. I posted a picture of one of the stamps next to a different brand with a similar design. I used the same nail polish. Light blue &#x3D; OPI Can&#x27;t Find my Czechbook Dark blue &#x3D;  OPI Yoga-ta Get This Blue! Oh and god forbid I use a top coat to erase it even more.</li>
    <li> Took a few days to arrive, but they are beautiful! Some are a little similar, but they&#x27;re mostly plant themed so that&#x27;s no surprise.</li>
    <li> These are a very nice set.  I love the &amp;#34;buffet&amp;#34; effect.</li>
    <li> Beautiful plates, thanks!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used all of them but the ones I have are great.</li>
