      <li>Alright, I&#x27;m sure that you all thinking that \\&quot;fresh balls\\&quot;...</li>
      <li>Thoroughly enjoy the stuff.</li>
      <li>Fresh balls is kind of funny to talk about...</li>
      <li>nothing like FRESH BALLS!  </li>
      <li>I get up every day,  take my shower,  then put on my Fresh Balls!  </li>
      <li>Perhaps if you live in a region not as warm or humid as South Florida, the product will work well for you.  </li>
      <li>This might have been good if they had sent what I ordered but they sent the solution in the orange and blue squeeze tubes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The only size now available is fine for your traveling kit but a bigger size for in-home use would be great.</li>
      <li>I use these when I am between showers especially on a hot and busy day.</li>
      <li>Fresh Balls.</li>
      <li>Also, despite the ease of use and pleasant smell of the product, the heavy marketing message did not meet expectations.  </li>
      <li>I ordered the six pack because it really works!</li>
      <li>According to them it works better than powder especially in the summer.</li>
      <li>, you still get warm down there just not wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
      <li>I work in a automotive factory, and I galvanize certain automotive products.  </li>
      <li>Great product for a touchy male subject.  </li>
      <li>MUCH fresher than I used to.</li>
      <li>This product seems to really help out.  </li>
      <li>Nope, real product... Bought some, and tried it out.  </li>
      <li>When temps are high and humid you will stay comfortable and fresh / dry.</li>
      <li>I mean on a good day, I can wring my cloths out before I go home.  </li>
      <li>Works far better than regular old baby powder.</li>
      <li>As you rub it in lightly it starts to absorb and dry into a powder that coats the skin.  </li>
      <li>As for me, I&#x27;ve returned to using Gold Bond Extra Strength powder (messy to use, but does a good job).</li>
      <li>My life hasn&#x27;t been the same since finding Fresh Balls.  </li>
      <li>work in a hangar outside and it gets hot...</li>
      <li>My balls are FRESH and dry.</li>
      <li>only the name is a gag, it really does work.  </li>
      <li>and I am old.  </li>
      <li>Keeps the boys fresh and dry the entire night shift.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t accurately describe the sensation like he would, but in his words, there is no more &amp;#34;sticky sack&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>This six pack cost about 40% less than at the spa where I saw this for the first time.  </li>
      <li>I used this product for about three weeks (I live in South Florida, so groin sweat is a major issue) and the product did not keep the groin region very dry.  </li>

<li> I use three dime size amounts, a little goes a long way.  </li>
<li> Definitely a value for the hard working</li>
<li> Just wish it was slightly cheaper</li>
<li> By the end of the day sitting at an office desk, I&#x27;m a little sweaty down there.</li>
<li> Does not stain underwear or cause any undo mess.</li>
<li> I have had trouble all my life</li>
<li> Due to their size it is difficult to keep the boys dry.</li>
<li> No more cloud of powder in the bathroom as well as no more chafing in the delicate area.</li>
<li> No more batwings!</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t had problems with wetness, chaffing, itching, or being uncomfortable at all since I&#x27;ve been using this.</li>
<li> it) can&#x27;t go wrong...</li>
<li> It is just really expensive.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
<li> On a bad day, it looks like I got pushed into a pool.  </li>
<li> You will not be disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I use these when I am between showers especially on a hot and busy day. Turned my son on to them too. It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;have to have&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know how I made it through  the summer without out it all these years.  Works WAY better than powder.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I re-order every time I run low.  My boys love it... So do my son&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> My husband learned about this product from a documentary. It was something he always wanted but never realized it until he got it. I can&#x27;t accurately describe the sensation like he would, but in his words, there is no more &amp;#34;sticky sack&amp;#34;. Great product!</li>
    <li> I used this product for about three weeks (I live in South Florida, so groin sweat is a major issue) and the product did not keep the groin region very dry.  Also, despite the ease of use and pleasant smell of the product, the heavy marketing message did not meet expectations.  Perhaps if you live in a region not as warm or humid as South Florida, the product will work well for you.  As for me, I&#x27;ve returned to using Gold Bond Extra Strength powder (messy to use, but does a good job).</li>
    <li> It does what it says.  This six pack cost about 40% less than at the spa where I saw this for the first time.  Bought it as stocking stuffers and gag gift for friends but turned out only the name is a gag, it really does work.  Great for the guy who runs in the summer. Updated to review:  These should not cost more than $9 a tube.  $80 for six is more than the spa where I go.</li>
    <li> This might have been good if they had sent what I ordered but they sent the solution in the orange and blue squeeze tubes.&lt;br /&gt;I read that other people that ordered this product were sent the same thing as I was so I thought for a moment that it was the same. One user reported they were the same but when you read the ingredients on the tube received and the ones blown up online of this tube they are different.  The orange and blue tubes are a cheaper product that stays sticky for 45 minutes before drying.  Who has time to wait 45 minutes after a shower?  Mine are now at the garbage dump.&lt;br /&gt;So beware when you order this silver tube because an orange and blue one is on its&#x27; way.</li>
    <li> I get up every day,  take my shower,  then put on my Fresh Balls!  I don&#x27;t go a day without it.</li>
    <li> This product RULES. My balls are FRESH and dry. The don&#x27;t stink, sweat, or stick to my legs. F-ing sexy. No more batwings!</li>
    <li> This product is incredible ...... When temps are high and humid you will stay comfortable and fresh / dry. Definitely a value for the hard working</li>
    <li> He loves it!  In five or six different instances he has recommended it to a friend then given him a bottle of it as a gift.  They all love it.</li>
    <li> This product is the bomb. Due to their size it is difficult to keep the boys dry. This product is a Godsend. Goes on as a liquid and dries in a snap before I dress. Keeps the boys fresh and dry the entire night shift. Easily washes off when you shower. Does not stain underwear or cause any undo mess. Great product for a touchy male subject.  Thank you! Fresh Balls.</li>
    <li> I have had trouble all my life and I am old.  This product seems to really help out.  I use it daily.</li>
    <li> Not sure how this stuff works - but it does - after a long day - the boys are still fresh &amp; dry!</li>
    <li> good christmas presents for the boys</li>
    <li> Works great. Smells great. Keeps you dry. It is just really expensive. One container lasted me about a week. I went to Gold Bond spray.</li>
    <li> Thoroughly enjoy the stuff. Works far better than regular old baby powder. Just wish it was slightly cheaper but it does what&#x27;s promised.</li>
    <li> This stuff works, it&#x27;s the same thing our G.I.&#x27;s use over in Camel Land to keep from turning into a big red sore!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for men to avoid chafing and sweating problems in the nether regions. I would like to see this product packaged in a larger size. The only size now available is fine for your traveling kit but a bigger size for in-home use would be great.</li>
    <li> I was expect better liquid and material, it is stick and wish with a better smell. but I can go with it, which is not the best.</li>
    <li> I love the stuff...work in a hangar outside and it gets hot...NC in August...well..lets just say...my balls are happy!  Its kinda pricey but love the stuff...I heard about it on Howard Stern...then went to the website...(google it) can&#x27;t go wrong...nothing like FRESH BALLS!  lol...litterally</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. All men need to get this before the summer heat comes. It is easy to apply and works great. You should definitely get it. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> works so good i ended up giving the rest away for xmas gift and they loved them too. now i know what to get for next xmas for the rest of the family</li>
    <li> By the end of the day sitting at an office desk, I&#x27;m a little sweaty down there. This takes care of the issue so I don&#x27;t have to take a shower at night.</li>
    <li> My son got a tube of this as a present and raved about it. Then my husband tried some and he also loved it. According to them it works better than powder especially in the summer. No more cloud of powder in the bathroom as well as no more chafing in the delicate area. I ordered the six pack because it really works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a mailman I use it all summer long! It&#x27;s the best!!! If you work outside use this and you will love it</li>
    <li> Fresh balls is kind of funny to talk about... PLUS it is a great product :)  It is a necessity in the Mojave Desert in summertime :)</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff! Dry balls are happy balls!</li>
    <li> My life hasn&#x27;t been the same since finding Fresh Balls.  I can&#x27;t go without it in the summertime now.  Obviously, if you are doing something active all day in 90+ degree heat ANYTHING you put on will wear off.  But if I&#x27;m just going through a normal day&#x27;s activities (working at the office, going out to lunch, running a few errands or two after work) I come home MUCH fresher than I used to.</li>
    <li> Alright, I&#x27;m sure that you all thinking that \\&quot;fresh balls\\&quot;... It&#x27;s gotta be a joke, or gag gift...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well no, its not.  I work in a automotive factory, and I galvanize certain automotive products.  Where I work it gets to be around 130F, and with all the protective gear I have to wear.  I SWEAT!  I mean on a good day, I can wring my cloths out before I go home.  On a bad day, it looks like I got pushed into a pool.  Anyways, I heard about this product on Jimmy Kimmel.  I was laughing thinking it was a joke, looked online... Nope, real product... Bought some, and tried it out.  I haven&#x27;t had problems with wetness, chaffing, itching, or being uncomfortable at all since I&#x27;ve been using this. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it&#x27;s not all that and a bag a chips, you still get warm down there just not wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How is it applied, and how does it work?  It&#x27;s technically a lotion, that you shake up and apply by hand.  As you rub it in lightly it starts to absorb and dry into a powder that coats the skin.  Now one tube will usually last me a month or so.  I use three dime size amounts, a little goes a long way.  Just try it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and would recommend it to all my friends! Would be the best thing ever if they lower the price.</li>
