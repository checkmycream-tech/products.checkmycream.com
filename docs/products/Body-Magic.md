      <li>Great product, better seller.</li>
      <li>But I am very satisfied with my body magic .</li>
      <li>The beige color is more of a darker size not the neutral color.</li>
      <li>This product was okay.</li>
      <li>so I will probably try it once I am able to.</li>
      <li>I really love this as soon as I tried it on.</li>

      <li>I love  MY BODY MAGIC AND RECOMMEND IT FOR THOSE WHO WANT THE TRIM SLIM LOOK RIGHT AWAY.  </li>
      <li>I measured a 32; and the 34 fit me too easily.</li>
      <li>The product fits my sister who measured under her bust 34 and got a 34, though I thought she should get a 36, I had to help her fit into it.</li>
      <li>The material is so cheap it ripped before I even pulled it up.</li>

      <li>its worth it compared to this cheap thing.</li>
      <li>This wasn&#x27;t the real body magic shaper from ardyss.</li>

      <li>Well I handed mine over to someone twice as big as me and she looks amazing.</li>

      <li>It turn out to be exactly what we were looking for.</li>

      <li>I can not believe how fast this is working.</li>
      <li>Thank you sooo much .</li>
      <li>Good customer service mean everything to me .</li>
      <li>and I have already gone from just being able to barely close it to being on the last row of hooks.</li>
      <li>I  wanted more and got less ...</li>
      <li>I live in Ghana.</li>
      <li>I can only assume that the seller was aware of Amazon&#x27;s policy that if an item is not returned with signature confirmation then amazon will not honor the claim...</li>
      <li>I bought my Ardyss and firstly, it was delivered on time, earlier than the delivery date.</li>
      <li>In addition, I am already a whole dress size smaller.</li>
      <li>I bought this and everyone started noticing me when I walked in to any place, such is the case that I met my husband in a club and 6 months later we got married.</li>
      <li>We were not sure if it was going to be original Ardyss product.</li>
      <li>Ordering the right size is harder than you think, with the measurements I was definitely a 34, when it arrived</li>
      <li>It really takes your waist and hips down</li>

    <li> I bought my Ardyss and firstly, it was delivered on time, earlier than the delivery date. I have used it and it works great, it flattened all the lumps and makes my body look great in clothes. I really am happy i got this and a few friends have also purchased after seeing mine.  Good work Ardyss!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was a little dissapointed with this product.  I have worn it 3 times and it&#x27;s already coming apart.  This is my fith body majic and never did I have this problem with the material tearing.</li>
    <li> I was very uncomfortable in this and a medium was a tad bit too big which is weird. My friend (200lbs) tried it on and wore it under her uniform and it worked for her. She continues to wear under her uniform at work and she stated its very comfortable and easy to get out of.</li>
    <li> Had this product before.  You can get someone to help you put it on the first time.  You have to be patient I did it by myself .  It took 3 hours but each time it gets easier.  It really takes your waist and hips down at least 3 inches you can tell the difference.  I will always be sold on this product even though it&#x27;s very difficult to get on once you do it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Yes,it requires a lot of patience to put it on.I purchased this item few days and I can tell it is working.I have dropped couple inches from my waist because that was my big concern.I am looking forward to share it with my friends.</li>
    <li> There was nothing wrong with the item, it was just the wrong size.  The problem came when I returned the item to the seller (StudentRising) and never received my refund.  Initially I was ignored by the seller when I inquired about my refund a week after returning it.  Therefore, three days later I filed a claim with Amazon and suddenly she replied to me telling me that she never received the item.  Next, Amazon denied my claim because I didn&#x27;t PAY EXTRA for SIGNATURE CONFIRMATION upon delivery.  I can only assume that the seller was aware of Amazon&#x27;s policy that if an item is not returned with signature confirmation then amazon will not honor the claim... So, two lessons learned from this experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) This seller cannot be trusted if you need to return an item.&lt;br /&gt;2) Amazon will not honor a refund claim unless you pay extra for signature confirmation upon delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, TRUST is the key - DON&#x27;T TRUST this seller because Amazon will NOT TRUST the United States Post Office and you will be the one who is cheated in the end.</li>
    <li> I can not believe how fast this is working. I have had this for only 3 days, now and I have already gone from just being able to barely close it to being on the last row of hooks. In addition, I am already a whole dress size smaller. Time to order the next size down.</li>
    <li> I pick these people and I felt like I may be taken a risk . But I am very satisfied with my body magic . And how fast I got it . It was just what I order . So it shows that you can&#x27;t believe every bad review you read . Good customer service mean everything to me . I will be ordering from these people in the future . Thank you sooo much .</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use the bathroom in this thing .. Not a smooth look a all.. I  wanted more and got less ...</li>
    <li> it was too big and they are making it very hard for me to return this item. I have not heard anything back from the company.</li>
    <li> Ordering the right size is harder than you think, with the measurements I was definitely a 34, when it arrived it fit me so perfect - IT DIDN&#x27;T SQUEEZE ANYTHING IN- which was very disappointing- then I ran into a private distributor who sells it for 80$... Well I handed mine over to someone twice as big as me and she looks amazing.</li>
    <li> I live in Ghana. Purchased the item for my wife. She has used one before. We were not sure if it was going to be original Ardyss product. It turn out to be exactly what we were looking for. So impressed with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sellers&#x27; customer service is second to non. I made a mistake with my delivery address and the product was returned but she re-posted to the correct address. I recommend the seller to any one who want to buy original Ardyss product.</li>
    <li> My sister came from Nigeria and we ordered this for her from Kathleen for ardyss and we had to contact her to choose a size and color and she replied immediately and when we ordered it, she sent it promptly and it was the original. The product fits my sister who measured under her bust 34 and got a 34, though I thought she should get a 36, I had to help her fit into it. I measured a 32; and the 34 fit me too easily. So I will probably get a 32 for myself. Great product, better seller.</li>
    <li> I bought this and everyone started noticing me when I walked in to any place, such is the case that I met my husband in a club and 6 months later we got married. I had to buy another one so I could switch them while the other got washed. Never stopped using them, until we said \\&quot;I do\\&quot;, he thinks I gained weight after we got married, but loves me know for me, Thank for helping me with the First Impression he got. Buy one YOU WON&#x27;T REGRET IT</li>
    <li> I really love this as soon as I tried it on. I Look great in it... I have a tummy with out it and a few rolls in my back but this smooths everything out...</li>
    <li> This product was okay. It does help with your shap but I don&#x27;t think it made me look smaller, which is what I was trying to do.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t the real body magic shaper from ardyss. It was of the same structure but with cheaper material. Take my advice and just buy the actuall body magic, the price is high but its worth it compared to this cheap thing. It doesn&#x27;t come up all the way like its supposed to. The material is so cheap it ripped before I even pulled it up. This is NOT an Adyss product nor a good knock off.</li>
    <li> I love  MY BODY MAGIC AND RECOMMEND IT FOR THOSE WHO WANT THE TRIM SLIM LOOK RIGHT AWAY.  KEEP IT COMING.</li>
    <li> Instantly drops you INCHES and gives you a coke bottle shape without surgery or shots, and makes you look amazing!  Helps decrease water weight!  I would recommend purchasing from a authorized distributor who can have it shipped from the warehouse (email wegrowmoneytrees@gmail for pricing and before and after pictures).  The short for 88 dollars or the long for 94 dollars. Guaranteed results or your money back!</li>
    <li> Still in the package. Have not tried it. The beige color is more of a darker size not the neutral color. Had a back surgery so I will probably try it once I am able to. I ordered it before my surgery for a party but didn&#x27;t get it in time. So now it&#x27;s still in the package.</li>
