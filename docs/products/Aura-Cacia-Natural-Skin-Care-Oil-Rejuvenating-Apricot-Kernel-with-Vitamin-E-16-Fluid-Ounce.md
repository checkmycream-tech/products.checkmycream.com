      <li>This feels better, works better, and no smell.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>My skin feels so silky smooth!</li>
      <li>Oils like this one are also really great for shaving if you have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The oil has a very light, neutral scent with a hint of the apricot, and does a great job of moisturizing skin that has a tendency to go dry.</li>
      <li>It came in a HUGE box it was easily a 2&#x27;x2&#x27; box</li>
      <li>These oils are fabulous and work great on the skin, especially after bathing.</li>
      <li>Very nice big bottle.</li>
      <li>My original review was 5 stars, now it is 2.</li>
      <li>I use this one and the Sweet Almond Oil.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for the OCM, or mixed with an essential oil for a wonderful smelling skin moisturizer.</li>
      <li>, it is nice and light, apply at the end of shower,goes a long way.</li>
      <li>As long as you don&#x27;t use too much, it&#x27;s a nice, light moisturizer that won&#x27;t cause irritation.  </li>
      <li>It has a really nice texture to it, a little more silky than almond oil.  </li>
      <li>So soft and healthy looking.</li>
      <li>It even has the dilution rate right on the bottle.</li>
      <li>I love apricot kernel oil in general.  </li>
      <li>We use it every day, either by itself or under lotion, and it&#x27;s really effective and absorbs quickly (as long as you don&#x27;t over-apply it).</li>
      <li>within the first week of nightly use at bedtime.</li>
      <li>Others are a tiny bit cheaper but this is a more ethical company.</li>
      <li>This oil soaks in quickly and makes my skin very soft.</li>
      <li>First, the legs- straight from the bottle-</li>
      <li>Pretty much indispensible for us in the winter months.</li>
      <li>Great for dry skin/ dry hair.  </li>
      <li>When I get REALLY dry skin, I pull out the avocado oil, but for my VERY dry skin, this is great.</li>
      <li>thing that works really well is to put the oil on your skin when you&#x27;re still damp from the shower (or even while you&#x27;re still in the shower, after using soap).  </li>
      <li>If you put much on you can track oil everywhere for a while.</li>
      <li>I ordered four bottles and despite fairly heavy use have not found the bottom of the first bottle after many months.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of products and none have shown such improvement, so quickly-</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be reporting back after several more weeks of nightly use to comment on any changes or benefits to my complexion.</li>
      <li>I recommend this product highly.</li>
      <li>The Apricot Kernel is a tad lighter in texture, and has helped my dry skin tremendously.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve just finished our first bottle, after 4 months of daily use by 2-3 people.</li>
      <li>Oil does not dissipate quickly which can be good or bad.</li>
      <li>I bought a bottle directly from Aura Cacia and this seller seems to have bought these bottles on a discount table (look at the packaging) or something</li>
      <li>and if you compare the smell this product is obviously old.</li>
      <li>I used to use olive oil, but I&#x27;d start to smell a bit like old oil by the end of the day, and I&#x27;ve been told that can encourage fungal growth (?).  </li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent at all, so I like to add essential oils</li>
      <li>Since I started using oils, I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my soft skin.  </li>
      <li>She&#x27;s had excema for about 8 years now, and has tried a lot of different things, but she says the apricot oil works very well.</li>
      <li>You must be consistent when you have extremely dry or crepey skin-</li>
      <li>I have very dry skin as a result of an operation, and therefore,  give myself daily a quick oil massage;  my skin has become silky;  </li>
      <li>The problem I have is that it doesn&#x27;t really help my very dry skin.</li>
      <li>A person with less dry skin could use almond oil, but it&#x27;s too light for me.  </li>
      <li>I use it for massage but also for general skin care substituting it for lotion.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> UPDATE 06/25/15: My original review was 5 stars, now it is 2. I bought a bottle directly from Aura Cacia and this seller seems to have bought these bottles on a discount table (look at the packaging) or something and if you compare the smell this product is obviously old. Should let buyers know that it&#x27;s a good price but inferior product.</li>
    <li> I love this oil for my skin also my hair , will continue to repurchase.</li>
    <li> Very good. Great for dry skin/ dry hair.  Great price too.  Others are a tiny bit cheaper but this is a more ethical company. Buy this one.</li>
    <li> Aura oils are great! I use this one and the Sweet Almond Oil. They are both great. The Apricot Kernel is a tad lighter in texture, and has helped my dry skin tremendously. The smell is wonderful and it absorbs well. Amazon has the best price of anywhere I&#x27;ve found it. Plus the bottle is sealed on the inside with foil, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it leaking during shipping. Had that problem before with a different product. Also, this oil has never left a residue on fabric. I can put it on, dress and go!</li>
    <li> This is a brand I have trusted for years. An esthetician who did my facials in the past used Aura Cacia products with glowing results and lots of compliments. I now use the oils to create body scrubs and as a  winter oil moisturizer for my face and body.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for the OCM, or mixed with an essential oil for a wonderful smelling skin moisturizer. After using this for a few weeks, I will never go back to lotion. My skin feels so silky smooth!</li>
    <li> I discovered this brand after having a bad experience with NOW customer service. Yes, I researched and switched and am very pleased with my decision. These oils are fabulous and work great on the skin, especially after bathing. So soft and healthy looking. I will purchase different oils from the same company. I want to try them all!</li>
    <li> This is a great natural alternative to lotion, which has a lot of nasty chemicals in it. This oil soaks in quickly and makes my skin very soft. Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this oil. We use it every day, either by itself or under lotion, and it&#x27;s really effective and absorbs quickly (as long as you don&#x27;t over-apply it). It&#x27;s unscented so it can be used without messing up my scent for the day.</li>
    <li> I have read that people who eat apricot seeds daily and use the oil from the kernels look 30 years younger. It&#x27;s hard for me to swear  to that since I don&#x27;t live in that part of the country where it&#x27;s a custom to eat the kernels or use the oil.... and, beginning to use the oil at the ripe old age of 78 is a stretch of the imagination to think I will suddenly look 58 again.  But, &amp;#34;hope springs eternal&amp;#34; so they say.  One can only hope.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several weeks now for both my legs and my face. First, the legs- straight from the bottle- and I can&#x27;t speak enough about how it is improving and healing my excessively dry and crepey skin.  I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of products and none have shown such improvement, so quickly- within the first week of nightly use at bedtime. You must be consistent when you have extremely dry or crepey skin- I keep it on my night stand so it&#x27;s hard to forget.  It absorbs quickly and does not leave me feeling uncomfortably oily. I also use this in my own blend with carrot seed, geranium, and rosehip oils for an anti-aging nightly face moisturizer- I&#x27;ll be reporting back after several more weeks of nightly use to comment on any changes or benefits to my complexion.</li>
    <li> I like this oil, it is nice and light, apply at the end of shower,goes a long way. Very nice big bottle.</li>
    <li> This oil is the perfect grade for my needs. I use it for my hands, hair and mix with some body lotion for s nice after shower lotion. Does not feel sticky like some oils I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I bought this apricot oil for my daughter who has excema. She says that the apricot oil works very good. She&#x27;s had excema for about 8 years now, and has tried a lot of different things, but she says the apricot oil works very well.</li>
    <li> I like the oil, it&#x27;s very light. The problem I have is that it doesn&#x27;t really help my very dry skin. I believe that it would be good for spring and summer use .</li>
    <li> I use a lot of Aura Cacia&#x27;s apricot kernel oil- It has a really nice texture to it, a little more silky than almond oil.  I use it to moisturize my skin and hair- it doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent at all, so I like to add essential oils sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;One thing that works really well is to put the oil on your skin when you&#x27;re still damp from the shower (or even while you&#x27;re still in the shower, after using soap).  As long as you don&#x27;t use too much, it&#x27;s a nice, light moisturizer that won&#x27;t cause irritation.  Since I started using oils, I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my soft skin.  Oils like this one are also really great for shaving if you have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t put this on my face, though, so no advice as to whether this would cause a breakout.  I&#x27;ve read that apricot kernel oil isn&#x27;t prone to causing breakouts, though.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin as a result of an operation, and therefore,  give myself daily a quick oil massage;  my skin has become silky;  I recommend this product highly.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful and also very affordable for the Aura Cacia line of oils . I am happy to have it !</li>
    <li> Holy packaging Batman!! It came in a HUGE box it was easily a 2&#x27;x2&#x27; box and I didn&#x27;t know what was in the box because I shop online frequently due to my proximity to town. Anyhoo, I love this oil it is a great carrier oil and lasted for hours! It even has the dilution rate right on the bottle. Love this and will purchase again when I use all of this!</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my doctor and I love it. I use it for massage but also for general skin care substituting it for lotion. I have multiple chemical sensitivity and this is perfect...no nasty toxic chemicals like so many products these days, even those marketed as &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I love apricot kernel oil in general.  A miracle worker during the harsh winter months.  I bathe my skin in this oil immediately out of the shower.  I do appreciate Aura Cacia adding vitamin E.  It gives the oil that extra oomph.  Also love the bottle &amp; cap.  Experienced a leaking cap from another brand ... Very messy.  To sum it up, great product!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve just finished our first bottle, after 4 months of daily use by 2-3 people. The oil has a very light, neutral scent with a hint of the apricot, and does a great job of moisturizing skin that has a tendency to go dry. Pretty much indispensible for us in the winter months. We started using it for our 1yo daughter, too, and we don&#x27;t use any other baby oil now.</li>
    <li> i buy this for my mom coz she said it keeps her skin hydrated and firm. i think i should also start using it :)</li>
    <li> I love Aura Cacia&#x27;s Apricot Kernel oil!  It&#x27;s a great product by a reputable company.  I use a lot of their essential oils too.</li>
    <li> Dry skin in the winter sucks!  Apricot kernel oil is great!  I put this all over after my shower.  I don&#x27;t even bother with a towel - I&#x27;m dry by the time this is on.  And then I put Curel body lotion on over it.  The lotion makes the oil absorb, so you don&#x27;t get your clothes oily.  I used to use olive oil, but I&#x27;d start to smell a bit like old oil by the end of the day, and I&#x27;ve been told that can encourage fungal growth (?).  This feels better, works better, and no smell.  I think it&#x27;s even the good Omega 3 type fat too. A person with less dry skin could use almond oil, but it&#x27;s too light for me.  When I get REALLY dry skin, I pull out the avocado oil, but for my VERY dry skin, this is great.</li>
    <li> stuff is great and feels great on my skin. I can&#x27;t honestly say whether it helps me or not but I hope it does. Oil does not dissipate quickly which can be good or bad. If you put much on you can track oil everywhere for a while. Then again, if you want to stay moist all day that can work out great for you. I ordered four bottles and despite fairly heavy use have not found the bottom of the first bottle after many months.</li>
