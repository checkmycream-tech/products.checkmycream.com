    <li> Out of the 30 batteries I purchased, a scant 14 could get to 1.5V or better.  These are cheap for a reason - they are factory rejects, and Maxell wouldn&#x27;t dare put these on a shelf.  Defective batteries in the 3 10-packs I received ranged from 1.3v to 0.71v.  One was dead-zero.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the old saying goes, &#x27;you get what you pay for&#x27;.  Buy junk, you get junk.  I don;t think Amazon should continue allowing purchases through this reseller.  It is pretty clear that you will have a 50% or better failure rate.</li>

    <li> As advertised.....and, what a bargain/deal!!!</li>
    <li> these were ordered for my son. He said they were a lot cheaper on Amazon than locally. They work well.</li>
