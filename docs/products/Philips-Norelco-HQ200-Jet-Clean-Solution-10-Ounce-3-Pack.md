<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Hard to find in stores.  Good deal.</li>
    <li> Works great with husbands new shaver</li>
    <li> Seems to work just as well as the old Norelco head cleaner.</li>
    <li> This is the branded cleaning solution for Norelco razors.  It keeps my razor clean.  I only wish I knew the formula so I could make it myself and save money.</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier than promised and was exactly as advertised. The cleaning solution makes a big difference in the maintenance of my Norelco shaver. Keeps blades and blade frame of shaver cleaner than a regular rinse with water.</li>
    <li> This products works great with the Norelco jetclean.  It disinfects and does what it advertised for.  Good product and at the right price</li>
    <li> What can I say other than this product is worth its price in bulk and other than not coming with the factory seal at the top (which is a bit odd), the product is as advertised and does what its supposed.</li>
    <li> Excellent  product and was shipped quickly</li>
    <li> Hubby very pleased with the availabilty!  Has used it for years!</li>
    <li> These are nice for keeping the razor clean. I find that with everyday use the bottle lasts me on average of about 30-45 days. keep in mind you have to empty the solution from time to time also, as it contains the leftover shavings that it cleans out of the blades.</li>
    <li> Makes cleaning the razor easy.</li>
    <li> The cleaning solution works as advertised and it cleans my Norelco shaver like it was brand new. I will order more whenever my supply gets close to depletion.</li>
    <li> when i found that i would be sent a bottle automaticaly at a fair price i was very pleased.  the thing that supprised me was they changed the order to a 3 pack.  so i guess i&#x27;ll order once a year instead of twice.  not very cool</li>
    <li> My husband has this shaver and it&#x27;s very hard to find the cleaning solution.  I was glad to know that this is the same one that I used to buy at the local store that no longer carries it.   It&#x27;s shipped at a good price and is Just Perfect!</li>
    <li> Works well (as it should) - but, their must be a cheaper way - Norelco saw us coming.</li>
    <li> WORKS VERY GOOD I CAN&#x27;T FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Excellent Shaver, excellent cleaning solution.  I simply love my Philips and will always keep it clean.</li>
    <li> Well, it&#x27;s exactly what is required by the Philips Norelco 8160XLCC SpeedXL Jet Clean Men&#x27;s Shaving Set according to the user&#x27;s manual, so it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  It&#x27;s also sold by and ships from Amazon.com, so you know it&#x27;s legit (at the time of this writing).  Just got it here since Walgreens failed and decided it&#x27;d be funny not to have it in stock.</li>
    <li> great product and cost</li>
    <li> Performs it&#x27;s intended purpose just fine.  Good deal.  Mine came in different bottles other than what&#x27;s pictured - but I don&#x27;t care about that.</li>
    <li> When you have the \\&quot;World&#x27;s BEST Shaver\\&quot;, you need to keep it running new every time you shave. HQ200 makes my 3D Norelco like new EVERY TIME I shave. Keeps it running much longer than other \\&quot;so-called\\&quot; solutions.</li>
    <li> I got my uncle a Norelco razor last Christmas along with some of this cleaning solution.  Norelcos are great razors to begin with and this cleaning solution is fantastic for keeping it in great shape.  The reason most razors wear out faster than they should is because they don&#x27;t get properly cleaned.  This cleaning solution will help avoid that issue.</li>
    <li> This is a very good cleaner but you can get it cheaper at WalMart. They only go for $4.28 instead of $7.75 per bottle.</li>
    <li> Genuine Norelco product. I tried the generic ones and they do not work nearly as well.</li>
    <li> Perfect, and for such a good price. Exactly what I wanted, and works as advertised. I would recommend to nayone who has the Norelco self cleaning kit.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Nice way to buy it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is way better than the smaller bottle I&#x27;ve been buying. It does have a manly smell to it, which I like. I&#x27;m usually picky about scented products, but this one is great. My razor seems to cut more smoothly than with the other solutions available from Norelco.</li>
    <li> I purchased this thinking the product went with the new razor I purchased for my hubby. When I discovered it couldn&#x27;t be used, I contacted the product owner for a return. The return was quickly processed.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working. A red warning light had been coming&lt;br /&gt;lit on the shaver handle warning that the shaver heads needed attention. After using this product that isn&#x27;t happening.</li>
    <li> 1. Chose rating since I can still use the product and getting a replacement would be a pure hassel. Okay?</li>
    <li> Cleaning solution for the Phillips Norelco Electric Razor, we were glad we purchased this 3-pack of the solution, saving some money at the same time.  It was packaged securely and arrived in perfect condition--ready to use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find this cleaning solution besides wal-mart.  I think it&#x27;s also cheaper.  You Ned this in order to clean the self cleaning norelco shavers.</li>
    <li> The Jet Clean Solution keeps the Norelco razor clean and allows disposal of cut hair into the toilet rather than the sink, which avoids clogging the smaller sink drain.</li>
    <li> I recently bought the new Norelco Spectra razor, with the self cleaning feature. This product works well....keeping the razore free of dirt and lubricated. I don not use it everyday, but every other day. And it still works great....</li>
    <li> The HQ200 Jet Clean Solution is recommended by Norelco for cleaning my razor head. It cleans well and helps keep the blades in top condition. There is enough solution in each bottle to fill my cleaning base at least 3 times. One fill lasts me about a month.</li>
    <li> Good way to clean my razor periodically. Instructions tells you to clean your razor about once a month using this type of solution. Makes a difference. Hot water rinses has it&#x27;s limitations.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s Norelco shaver requires this solution for the cleaning and storage cycle.  It is expensive but does a great job of cleaning the shaver and preserving the blades.  I did lots of internet research and found that Amazon is the cheapest of the many places where I can buy this.  The subscription plan makes it even cheaper and assures that we never run out.</li>
    <li> Better then cartridges.</li>
    <li> Bought this product as my new shaver came with a cleaning unit.&lt;br /&gt;If anyone cleans their shaver on a regular basis with a fast stream of hot water, this solution IS NOT REQUIRED.&lt;br /&gt;Keep your money.</li>
    <li> The Norelco HQ200 Jet Cleaning solution arrived on time and my husband is so happy to have it. Can&#x27;t find it in the stores.</li>
    <li> If you have a Norelco electric shaver that uses the jet cleaning system, then you cannot do without this cleaning solution. Yes, you can use the little brush to clean the shaver and do a pretty good job, but it doesn&#x27;t get it as sparkling clean as with the Jet Clean Solution.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described.</li>
    <li> This is a necessity with my husband&#x27;s razor and does a good job cleaning his razor.</li>
    <li> This really makes a difference in the quality of the shave and keeps the razor clean. Good for the razor too.</li>
    <li> The cleaning solution is fine.  Just don&#x27;t trust the manual&#x27;s stuff about how often to use it.  That&#x27;s written by the \\&quot;selling more razor blades\\&quot; department.  If you read the manual carefully, it says that you shouldn&#x27;t recharge the battery uintil the shaver blinks at you.  But the cleaning process automatically recharges. When I called the company they admitted you shouldn&#x27;t clean the shaver frequently.  I find doing it when I need to recharge does fine, and will save money.</li>
    <li> My razor is clean and smells nice.</li>
    <li> Have used the product before and it works well in the cleaning/charging apparatus.  This shipmentwas packaged differently from the illustration , but seems to be the same stuff</li>
    <li> The product works great. I&#x27;ve used this product for several years.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what it says it is. It works perfectly well cleansing my razor and it&#x27;s a good price.</li>
    <li> This product does the job and has been so difficult to find locally.  Keeps my razor top notch ... Clean and smooth.</li>
    <li> It really improved the shave quality. Very close and smooth.</li>
    <li> Glad this stuff is still available</li>
    <li> Excellent cleaning solution.</li>
    <li> The solution works great to clean the shaver.  My husband appreciated the 3-pack and won&#x27;t have to buy it so often. It is a great product!</li>
    <li> It works like a charm. This product is just as advertised.  It does a great job of cleaning the heads on my razor.</li>
    <li> A great cleaning and lubricating solution for norelco razors.  I do not have the &amp;#34;cleaning system&amp;#34;,  but I wash the head with water then submerge the head in this solution (using a small tupperware bowl).  The cleaner loosens all the hair that the water has not washed out, and lubricates the blades.</li>
    <li> Keeps it clean and lubricated, can tell the difference when I do not use it.</li>
    <li> If you look at the picture, you see a Phillips Norelco product which is the product we ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the product that we received is very different. It is a &amp;#34;cool breeze&amp;#34; scent in a rectangular vial.&lt;br /&gt; It is not what we ordered. This product has been misrepresented on your website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have used this product in the past, and ordered the one you show in your picture. But that is not the product you sent to us. This item will be returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are very disappointed in Amazon. In the past we always received the products ordered as described. Recently that has changed. We will be more hesitant to place any orders with this website in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry Amazon. You had something good, but your program has changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rhoda Fiala</li>
    <li> Good price and prompt delivery. Pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Last Christmas my Brother did got a Norelco 1280X Senor Touch Razor. And he truly swears by how close the razor shaves. Plus how clean this Jet Clean Solution wash up the razor.</li>
    <li> No problem great product and delivery</li>
    <li> Good price, shipped timely and is the same as the stuff I could purchase at an in-store markup but now I don&#x27;t need to.</li>
    <li> Product is fairly difficult to find in most grocery or drug stores so buying from Amazon is a great convenience.  The product itself works as specified.</li>
    <li> Its primary use is to clean ones electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;It works exactly as promised and I would recommend this to anyone who wants a truly clean razor.&lt;br /&gt;J. McNally</li>
    <li> what a ripoff. Not enough liquid. Now my machine cleaning system thing broke. Norelco sucks. They make cheap shat now.</li>
    <li> Product pictured is the original HQ200 solution.  Product shipped is the new HQ200 &amp;#34;cool breeze&amp;#34; scent in the&lt;br /&gt;rectangular white bottle.</li>
    <li> Too costly for ultimate use !</li>
    <li> Item was as described</li>
    <li> Good stuff for razor cleaning</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to keep the new razor clean and lubricated.  Three bottles in the package will last for quite a while.</li>
    <li> It refilled my shaver well cleaner. It was the best value that I could find anywhere. I am pleased I bought it.</li>
    <li> I have always used Norelco electric shavers and glad I came across this product.  It is a must have if you really want to clean you&lt;br /&gt;electric razor of built up debris.  I will continue to buy this product for it voids your razor of all build up in the razor head.</li>
    <li> The HQ200 cleaning solution  plays an important tool in my Norelco shaving system&#x27;s &#x27;thorough cleaning toolbox&#x27;.  The solution makes probably makes manual cleaning and removal of facial hair from my shaver easier and also apparently  dislodges the many tiny hair particles into the solution bath, itself. I strongly suggest using this product if you&#x27;re serious about keeping your shaver really clean so that it functions at its best.  I always purchase HQ200 from Amazon in the 3-pk as this is, for me, the most economical.</li>
    <li> Great Product to clean electric razor!  I would recommend this product to everyone who has a Norelco razor. This cleans, disinfects, and lubricates your razor.</li>
    <li> I use it every time my cordless razor&#x27;s battery runs down. It came with an automatic cleaner and charger and you just pour some of this into the cleaner bowl and turn it on and it does a very good job of cleaning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this solution to anyone who needs it</li>
    <li> The cleaning solution came at an acceptable length of time and has meet all my expectations.  It is an amazing product.</li>
    <li> good cleaner for Norelco razor</li>
    <li> Does a good job on my razor</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly and was exactly what I expected. Thank you</li>
    <li> The solution formula has probably changed since it does not seem to clean as much as older solution (2 years ago) and the price is still high for the little it delivers. Besides the picture here does not match the real product delivered. Anyway you can try your own cleaning solution with water, good quality liquid soap and a little salt (to make it compatible with the cleaning device), it will probably work better and less expensive.</li>
    <li> Continues to be a great product.  I have used for almost two years and it does a great job.  If you regularly rinse razor under running water after each use you can extend the life of the solution 2-3 times.</li>
    <li> A must have for electric shaver</li>
    <li> Having switched from a long time Braun user to a Norelco Sensotouch 3D Ihave to say the Norelco cleaning system is a marvel. However finding the Jet clean solution is no easy task. Stores that carry the razor (I bought mine here on Amazon) always seem to be out of the cleaning soloution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One odd thing I have noticed is that there is no difference in scent or performance between the regular and the cool breeze. it&#x27;s pretty much a non issue as both do a geat job in keeping your blades fresh and clean. Because there is no alcohol in the Norelco solution oils and gunk can build up on your blades - it&#x27;s a quick fix with a quick rinse every now and then under very hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great deal on a hard to find product - plus with your Prime membership you get Free two day shippin to boot.</li>
    <li> The jet clean solution is good but pricey.  It would not suprise me if there is not a home remedy that would work just as well for a significantly lower cost.</li>
    <li> The product was exactly as described and was shipped very quickly.I would not hesitate to order again.It was a great price for this product.</li>
    <li> could not use for my electric razoe</li>
    <li> It cleans my razor well. That&#x27;s about it. If does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Not a lot more to say here.</li>
    <li> The Phillips Norelco Jet Clean Solution does exactly what it says it will do.  My husband has had his razor for 2 years and does the cleaning twice a week.  The blades are just as sharp and it runs just as smoot.  Thank you for an excellant product.</li>
    <li> just want my grandfather uses</li>
    <li> Buy a Braun. If it&#x27;s time to buy this refill you need to shop for a new Braun razor in stead of wasting money on keeping your Philips. But the solution is better than most. Good luck.</li>
    <li> The photo provided is a little different then what I got but that doesn&#x27;t matter because it is in fact the Norelco cleaning solution.  Arrived in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> The solution is the correct one for the razor we own.  Our local stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore.  The blades are still being carried locally, but it is frustrating that the solution is not.  We were delighted too find it here on Amazon as the razor still works excellently. The bottles arrived packed nicely without any leaks or damage.  They also came in a timely manner. I would highly recommend this vendor.</li>
    <li> I normaly wet shave with skin sensetive foaming shave cream and hot water and then rinse the shaver with hot water. Problem is that after a while the shaver needs a good cleaning and i use the Norelco jet Clean solution. It does a good job. If you want to keep your shaver in top shape I suggest using the jet cleaner.</li>
    <li> This keeps the Philips Norelco 1250X/47 SensoTouch 3D Electric Razor with Jet Clean System clean &amp; working, so I can have a great shave&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Jet Clean Solution works well and keeps the shaver clean.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning solution lasts a long time before needing refills.</li>
    <li> glad to find the product, couldn&#x27;t find it locally.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco razors for more than 20 years.  The new one with the jet cleaning machine works really well at keeping the razor clean and charged.</li>
    <li> The only other place I can find this stuff is Wal-Mart.  The deal on here is cheaper than Wal-Mart, which often doesn&#x27;t have this in stock anyway...</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCT I RECEIVED IS NOT THE ONE DEPICTED IN THE PICTURE. IS A NEW SOLUTION WITH A NEW FORMULA IN WHITE SQUARE BOTTLES. NO PROBLEM BUT PLEASE CHANGE THE PICTURE.</li>
    <li> The product works as advertised but I did not receive the clear bottles. The clear bottles are what I ordered. I want them so I could see how much remained in the bottle. I received the solid white containers. Not happy with that at all.</li>
    <li> The price is rights. keeps shaver clean. I use it every two weeks and my razor cuts are still clean!</li>
    <li> This just does an outstanding job in helping keep my razor clean.  I have been using it for years and would not use any other.</li>
    <li> I like this surf! The price is reasonable at it simply works very well. I would give it a 5 stars,  but I wish it came in a larger bottle.</li>
    <li> I was looking for this item specifically because it goes with the cleaning system for the Phillips norelco shaver.  Works well with the cleaning system.</li>
    <li> Just what the doctor ordered for my new shaver, now if the shaver cleaning unit would just stop dripping the stuff on the counter top....</li>
    <li> Great value and great product</li>
    <li> Had looked for this produce for some time in locale stores, then found it on Amazon. Produce works just fine and makes cleanup much easier.</li>
    <li> Cheaper to buy the three pack vs just buying one in a regular store. Defiantly will buy again!! I recommend  it!!</li>
    <li> As of yet I have only used the solution 2 times on my [[ASIN:B006GQYSC8 Philips Norelco AT810/41 Powertouch with Aquatec Electric Razor]] and each time the razor cut my beard faster than before I used the solution.  I have only used the jell once to shave and it was cleaned as soon as I finished shaving.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to at a decent price. Item was well packaged, arrived on time. I was very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great for your Jet Clean razor. Dont buy the off brand. Get the stuff made just for your razor</li>
    <li> It is expensive for what it is but it does the job. Cheaper buying it here than anywhere else so recommend you buy it, no problems for me apart from it doesn&#x27;t last that long.  Don&#x27;t drink it.  It tastes pretty bad.</li>
    <li> Buying the 3 pack lowered the cost. They will last quite a while but I have them.</li>
    <li> arrived on time and product is good.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s a little high in price for as often as they want you to change the fluid. But, it&#x27;s as good as the manufacture.</li>
    <li> Hard to find these around where I live.  So I bought the 3 pack to last a while.  Works great.</li>
    <li> Bottles were different but I assume it&#x27;s the same solution.  Seems to work fine.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and price. Hard to find item.</li>
    <li> I was expecting the full size bottles.  The pictured bottle isn&#x27;t what I received.  I&#x27;m not sure if the product was misrepresented.</li>
    <li> I shopped around, this was the best price I could find, so I bought it. My husband loves his razor and this keeps it clean and running well. I bought replacement fluid from Amazon before, it is difficult to find. I love having it brought to my door, no traffic, no hassle.</li>
    <li> Was unable to purchase in any of the local stores and it works great!</li>
    <li> This solution cleaned my razor wonderfully.  I have a Norelco Senso Touch 3D and it cleaned it great. Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Never used a cleaner before, but this works great.</li>
    <li> I was given a Norelco shaver as a gift and the product required this brand of cleaning solution. I was looking for more of the cleaning solution because it is a consumable. It does a good job and I will buy it again when the need arises, hopefully at a lesser price.</li>
    <li> Good value for the money. We always keep these on hand.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product thinking that it could be used independently. The ad did not say that a charging and cleaning system was needed for its use. Therefore I needed to return it. I am used to finding a return label on the invoice page but there was none I had to print my own for the return of the item.</li>
    <li> a good product to use if you have the jet clean system for your electric razor.  works as it should.</li>
    <li> I liked the new shape flattened bottles, they fit in my cupboard better easier to store in my bathroom, good price</li>
    <li> For the record, this is not the actual product you will get. You get the larger white bottles ;)</li>
    <li> I would like to not have to bother, but the razor requires this stuff and if you dont use it the razor wont last as long. I use it religiuosly and have for years now and havent had to replace the razor in about 4 years now.</li>
    <li> Have used it forever and love it  -- although my Norelco razor may be cleaned with water, the Jet Clean solution does a far better job.</li>
    <li> Received the Philips Jet Clean Solution 3 pack sooner than expected and the solution bottles were also bigger than the picture.  Was pleasantly surprised and very happy with the product and will buy this one again.  Also would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is the cleaning solution for my razor. It does a good job of not only cleaning but also lubricating my razor.</li>
    <li> It kind of sucks to continue to buy these over and over, but I&#x27;ve tried using my Philips electric without this cleaner and it definitely makes a huge different to the cleanliness of your razor and the quality of your shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product. I go through a bottle about every 6 weeks, so I recommend the 3-pack to save some money.</li>
    <li> Rxcellent service, quality product.</li>
    <li> Dipping the running shaver head in this solution immediately cleans it thoroughly.  All that is needed more is to rinse off the shaver head and it will be as clean as it was when purchased, before it was used.  A small container slightly wider than the shaver head to pour the solution into is all that is needed.  The solution does not need to be any deeper than the thinckness of the shaver head. The Norelco company would do well to supply such a container with the product.  It seems it could be incorporated into the cap to close the bottle of solution.  This can be used with all water tolerable Norelco shaver heads (not just the ones identified by Norelco).</li>
    <li> Use half the bottle for washes 1-15, change out solution from basin/tray from JetClean System, and apply the other half for washes 16 - 30. Works good. There&#x27;s a slight fragrance, but not much.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF WORKS GREAT! IT KEEP THE BLADES LIKE NEW!!!</li>
    <li> Okay, this cleaning solution certainly does the job, and I love the cleaning system as a whole.  I like the smell, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and it does clean the razor, so it does the job.  This package deal is definitely the best one out there, but that still can&#x27;t come close to remedying the extremely excessive price of a glorified water-based cleaning product.</li>
