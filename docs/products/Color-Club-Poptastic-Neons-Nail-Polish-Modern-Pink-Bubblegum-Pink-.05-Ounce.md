      <li>This product came fast through the mail!!</li>
      <li>Was very satisfy with the nail polish!!</li>
      <li>It is a very pretty bright &amp;#34;Barbie&amp;#34; pink.</li>
      <li>This polish was just what my daughter and I were looking for, a bright pink \\&quot;pop color\\&quot; for summer sandals.</li>
      <li>It is by far the most amazing Pink I have ever seen!!!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
      <li>Love this polish and will purchase a second bottle!  </li>
      <li>I love this pink, bright pink.</li>
      <li>I have gone through bottles of this color and it never fails.</li>
      <li>This pink is not on the neon side, more on the bright baby pink side.  </li>
      <li>It is subtle yet attractive.  </li>
      <li>Someone told me it looked Barbie pink, and I took that as a compliment because that&#x27;s exactly what I was going for :)  </li>

      <li>I take it to my manicurist and everyone wants to borrow it.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s almost like paint, and I mean that in a good way.  </li>

      <li>You will LOVE this pink!</li>
      <li>With other polishes they chip off my 9yr olds nails in a couple days, even with a top coat/hardener but with Color Club</li>
      <li>Along with a little glitter you can get some amazing super pink sparkly nails.</li>
      <li>The nail polish arrived promptly in brand new condition.</li>
      <li>The only thing I dont like is that it kind of takes long to dry then other nail polishes and it chips fast</li>
      <li>The color is less &amp;#34;Barbie Pink&amp;#34; and more of a coral pink</li>
      <li>Intense, vivid pink.</li>
      <li>The color was a bubble gum pink at first</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to describe, but they go on with a different look than most polishes--</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of my favorites and I&#x27;m usually not a pink girl.</li>

    <li> Really really pleased with my new bottle of nail polish. It got to me in record time. I had this color or one very similar a couple years ago that don&#x27;t make anymore. So very pleased with how close in color they are.</li>
    <li> The bottle came with a slightly different logo, and the color was about 2 shades lighter than the original.</li>
    <li> This product came fast through the mail!! Was very satisfy with the nail polish!! Loved the color!! Will buy from her/him again!! :)</li>
    <li> I Loveeeee this color, I am sooo happy with it, color club has great formula and beautiful colors in all their collection, it dried fast, and looked great!&lt;br /&gt;The bottle looked somehow like someone had opened it, but I just fell in love with this color that I did t care that much</li>
    <li> Intense, vivid pink. I like a glass shine top coat to finish.</li>
    <li> Favorite pink EVER. I have gone through bottles of this color and it never fails. The perfect Barbie/Bubblegum neon pink</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t seen Color Club polish before, you are in for a treat. It&#x27;s hard to describe, but they go on with a different look than most polishes--it&#x27;s almost like paint, and I mean that in a good way.  Their colors are very different and they stand out--people always notice when I wear a Color Club color.  If you like pink, this color is absolutely awesome.    It is brighter than the picture shows, almost a little flourescent.  LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> Love this color ! It is a very pretty bright &amp;#34;Barbie&amp;#34; pink. Just what I wanted. The color was a bubble gum pink at first but when I used a white base coat it changed completely. Only took two coats.</li>
