<ol>
      <li>(the best out of the 3)...  </li>
      <li>It is the best for my hair</li>
      <li>I was very happy.</li>
      <li>this is great stuff and everyone should have it for every day of their lives!!!</li>
      <li>this happened to me before... used a hair product... looked great...</li>
      <li>Amazing!</li>
      <li>I have a good feeling it will.</li>
      <li>Not really unpleasant, just doesn&#x27;t smell great!</li>
      <li>This is a great conditioner even for colored hair, love these products.</li>
      <li>Nice conditioner, wish it had a nicer smell though</li>
      <li>Nice customer service</li>
      <li>I also use an aloe vera gel moisturizer along with a leave-in conditioner and my hair feels very strong and healthy.  </li>
      <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
      <li>i didn&#x27;t think i&#x27;d be able to match...</li>
      <li>but the scent could have been better.</li>
      <li>I love the conditioner.</li>
      <li>but I might try the shampoo again just to check to make sure it&#x27;s not both doing the drying</li>
      <li>Totally satisfied.</li>
      <li>but after a while, I noticed that I was losing more and more hair when I rinsed.</li>
      <li>I love the way my hair felt after using it.</li>
      <li>Since this conditioner had pretty good review, I decided to order one and try it out.</li>
      <li>5 most important things that leave your hair healthy and shiney are aloe vera, wheat germ oil, jojoba and dimethicone....</li>
      <li>Im still looking for my perfect deep conditioner thats great without me mixing anything in it, but i&#x27;ll always come back to this conditioner when I need to.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say I loved the shampoo as much.</li>
      <li>Product is great and it came super fast.</li>
      <li>its strong and stinky.. turns out because of the cheap smelling perfume they dumped in it... wasn&#x27;t sure if it was just this conditioner or jason&#x27;s shampoo too</li>
      <li>Bought this in conjunction with the Jason anti-dandruff shampoo and after one use my hair feels silky smooth and soft!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>On skin, aloe is amazing, but not so much for the hair, just makes it drier and sticky-like.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Jason brand shampoos for a year or so now, and I&#x27;ve tried various different scents and types just to see what I liked best.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair feel smooth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always been pretty happy with the results, and I like that Jason&#x27;s products are natural, organic, and sulfate-free.</li>
      <li>I have pretty healthy hair but somewhat damaged ends, and I feel that this conditioner makes them smooth and manageable.</li>
      <li>The only downside is that the smell is not altogether pleasant.</li>
      <li>Jason&#x27;s mostly aloe conditioner is not a good idea, I don&#x27;t think Aloe is actually very good for hair.  </li>
      <li>and then it worked just as good as any deep conditioner that ive used before.</li>
      <li>i used a couple on their own and my hair did look soft and shiney..  </li>
      <li>i used a couple on their own and my hair did look soft and shiney..  </li>
      <li>Fast shipper love the product.</li>
      <li>And most importantly, I stopped losing a big chunk of my hair.</li>
      <li>the only thing alcohol should be used for is to sterilize.. it shouldn&#x27;t be in anything that you want to make soft and shiny because it&#x27;ll cancel it  the 5 most important things that leave your hair healthy and shiney are aloe vera, wheat germ oil, jojoba and dimethicone....</li>
      <li>I bought this conditioner hoping for something more natural for my hair</li>
      <li>I was using Garnier Fructis Pure Clean line and it did</li>
      <li>a lot like the shampoo i&#x27;d been using for 10 plus years until they decided to stop making it -creme of nature (the original older version) -  which</li>
      <li>I leave it on for 5-15 minutes and it washes off easily, leaving my hair soft with a hint of shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product is a good quality product, but it doesn&#x27;t make my hair soft enough.</li>
      <li>I am sure I will be shopping from here in the future.</li>
      <li>I felt like I really had used a conditioner!</li>
      <li>just when it was starting to grow healthy before i used it..</li>
      <li>just when it was starting to grow healthy before i used it..</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s definitely this conditioner because it has Stearyl Alcholol as one of the top ingrediants which means theres a lot of it in there...</li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>then a couple days later went from great to dry to breaking off... turns out its the alcohol they put in it..</li>
      <li>I tend to prefer sweet smells, so I apply a dab of natural scent afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I might try the shampoo again just to check to make sure it&#x27;s not both doing the drying  ADDED: my hairs REALLY breaking off now a week after using this and is extremely dry...</li>
      <li>These items came fast.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i used this about 2 times before i finally really read the back only because when i used it i actually liked how it made my hair look</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>It really helped bring out the shine in my hair and reduce breakage.</li>
      <li>Used this product for years, works very well for me.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This isn&#x27;t really a pro or con, but after washing it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair with any smell.</li>
      <li>After using this conditioner my hair was very soft and my curls were more loose than before.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair but a lot of it, with wave and frizz, wear it long when I can .</li>
      <li>I have tried several ALL NATURAL conditioners, and I appreciate that JAson&#x27;s products do use really healthy natural ingredients, but I really didn&#x27;t like this conditioner at all.  </li>
      <li>I decided to write a quick review after using this particular conditioner last night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it gets dried out pretty easy</li>
      <li>Works very well and keeps hair soft.</li>
      <li>I suffer from scalp psoriasis and this helps heal my breakouts and helps calm and heal open sores.</li>
      <li>Once I got the conditioner out of the bottle, I noticed that the texture is thicker than what I normally use.</li>
      <li>(I live in super-dry climate too).  </li>
      <li>I put off looking for a new natural shampoo for a while because its hard as hell to find shampoo with exactly what i want (3 or 4 main natural ingrediants that make my hair look really good) without the companies adding a crapload of other stuff i dont want in my hair...</li>
      <li>but i only look for the first 4...</li>
      <li>but i only look for the first 4...</li>
      <li>I like its natural composition though!</li>
      <li>I decided to search for a new shampoo and conditioner and I came across Jason Natural Cosmetics.</li>
      <li>Anyway, I have found several other natural conditioners that work far better than this one.  </li>
      <li>at all... i would never put any kind of alcohol in my hair unless i was trying to eff it up on purpose... dry it out and give myself dead ends...  </li>
      <li>i actually bought all 4 of those things pure and organic on here by themselves</li>
      <li>i actually bought all 4 of those things pure and organic on here by themselves</li>
      <li>My hair felt so soft and looked shinier after using this conditioner.</li>
      <li>I only use natural haircare and I have a lot of fun experimenting with different products.</li>
      <li>It dries out my hair and it smells like potpourri from an old bathroom.</li>
      <li>Makes your hair really soft but he smells like medicine</li>
      <li>I have found the conditioner very gentle on my extremely thin, fine hair.  </li>
      <li>but the combo of this plus jason&#x27;s shampoo both have the same ingrediants as creme of nature (the main 3 or 4 i look for )...  </li>
      <li>First thing I noticed is that it&#x27;s much more thick and creamy than the other Jason conditioners (and any conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried other than special, deep conditioners and conditioning hair masks).</li>
      <li>that plus the perfume.. which is alcohol on top of alcohol.. not good for your hair..</li>
      <li>A lot of conditioners just feel like they are not really doing very much for my hair, but this one actually detangled it and left it feeling much softer.</li>
      <li>: my hairs REALLY breaking off now a week after using this and is extremely dry...</li>
      <li>the only thing alcohol should be used for is to sterilize.. it shouldn&#x27;t be in anything that you want to make soft and shiny because it&#x27;ll cancel it&lt;br</li>
      <li>Next time I wash and condition, I&#x27;ll leave this conditioner on longer to see if that gets rid of the frizz completely.</li>
      <li>I have fairly curly, somewhat thick hair that I usually straighten so</li>
      <li>Only drawbacks to me is it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft as what I thought before I bought it, also it sometimes takes a second wash to get it to lather</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair (African American)</li>
      <li>My curls were much smoother but not weighed down.     </li>
      <li>Very thick and does not go on as easy as i thought it would.</li>

<li> /&gt;It has a satisfyingly thick consistency that you really feel coats your hair with nutrients.</li>
<li> When I deep conditioned with it my hair didnt have that extra softness that it usually has after I rinse.</li>
<li> only thing about shopping online is that its hard to read the back of the bottle to see all of the ingrediants...</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Jason brand shampoos for a year or so now, and I&#x27;ve tried various different scents and types just to see what I liked best. I&#x27;ve always been pretty happy with the results, and I like that Jason&#x27;s products are natural, organic, and sulfate-free. I finally bought and tried the aloe conditioner today, and it blows the rest out of the water.     First thing I noticed is that it&#x27;s much more thick and creamy than the other Jason conditioners (and any conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried other than special, deep conditioners and conditioning hair masks). I could feel the difference it made in the texture of my hair immediately. Even as I was rinsing it out, my hair somehow felt stronger and smoother. I let my hair air-dry with no product, and there&#x27;s significantly less frizz than I normally end up with after washing. My curls were much smoother but not weighed down.     Next time I wash and condition, I&#x27;ll leave this conditioner on longer to see if that gets rid of the frizz completely. I have a good feeling it will. I&#x27;ll definitely be sticking to the aloe conditioner from here on out, and once I run out of Jason&#x27;s lavender shampoo, I&#x27;ll be giving the aloe shampoo a try as well.</li>
    <li> I gave this product to my son who was having flaky hair skin problems. He said it has almost cleared it up so 5 stars to this one.</li>
    <li> I read a review on another site that said this could be used as alone as a deep conditioner so I bought it. When I deep conditioned with it my hair didnt have that extra softness that it usually has after I rinse. I was disappointed but I decided to give it another try. The next time I used it I mixed some oils in it and some agave nectar(its similar to honey) and then it worked just as good as any deep conditioner that ive used before. Im still looking for my perfect deep conditioner thats great without me mixing anything in it, but i&#x27;ll always come back to this conditioner when I need to.</li>
    <li> I have tried several ALL NATURAL conditioners, and I appreciate that JAson&#x27;s products do use really healthy natural ingredients, but I really didn&#x27;t like this conditioner at all.  I have fairly curly, somewhat thick hair that I usually straighten so it gets dried out pretty easy (I live in super-dry climate too).  Anyway, I have found several other natural conditioners that work far better than this one.  Jason&#x27;s mostly aloe conditioner is not a good idea, I don&#x27;t think Aloe is actually very good for hair.  On skin, aloe is amazing, but not so much for the hair, just makes it drier and sticky-like.  Ick :(</li>
    <li> I bought this conditioner hoping for something more natural for my hair and I must say it delivers! I love the way my hair felt after using it. A lot of conditioners just feel like they are not really doing very much for my hair, but this one actually detangled it and left it feeling much softer. I felt like I really had used a conditioner! Can&#x27;t say I loved the shampoo as much. The only downside is that the smell is not altogether pleasant. Not really unpleasant, just doesn&#x27;t smell great!</li>
    <li> These items came fast. Nice customer service and they sent an extra bottle when I asked for two. Told me to keep it. I was very happy. Would order from this company again. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Amazing! Makes my hair feel smooth.</li>
    <li> Works very well and keeps hair soft. I have noticed less dandruff since using it as well.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair really soft but he smells like medicine</li>
    <li> Excellant.  Totally satisfied.</li>
    <li> Bought this in conjunction with the Jason anti-dandruff shampoo and after one use my hair feels silky smooth and soft!&lt;br /&gt;Will update in a few weeks!</li>
    <li> Very thick and does not go on as easy as i thought it would. Not great conditioner for me at least</li>
    <li> this is great stuff and everyone should have it for every day of their lives!!!</li>
    <li> Used this product for years, works very well for me.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I have found the conditioner very gentle on my extremely thin, fine hair.  I leave it on overnight and I must say that I have noticed a slight improvement in the texture of my hair and the shredding.</li>
    <li> This is a great conditioner even for colored hair, love these products.</li>
    <li> Nice conditioner, wish it had a nicer smell though</li>
    <li> I love Jason products but this one was a big disappointment. It dries out my hair and it smells like potpourri from an old bathroom. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I was using Garnier Fructis Pure Clean line and it did it&#x27;s job but after a while, I noticed that I was losing more and more hair when I rinsed. I&#x27;m in my mid 20&#x27;s and I&#x27;m not ready to go bald. I decided to search for a new shampoo and conditioner and I came across Jason Natural Cosmetics. Since this conditioner had pretty good review, I decided to order one and try it out. Once I got the conditioner out of the bottle, I noticed that the texture is thicker than what I normally use. My hair felt so soft and looked shinier after using this conditioner. And most importantly, I stopped losing a big chunk of my hair. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this conditioner a couple of times. This product is a good quality product, but it doesn&#x27;t make my hair soft enough. I like its natural composition though!</li>
    <li> I have tried over a 100 conditioners. This one I bought because there was nothing else on the shelves in a little grocery store while I was traveling. It is the best for my hair I have ever used. I have fine hair but a lot of it, with wave and frizz, wear it long when I can . With this conditioner I can! And I don&#x27;t have to use any other products in addition.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair (African American) and I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that will help loosen my culs and this product did it!  After using this conditioner my hair was very soft and my curls were more loose than before.  I also use an aloe vera gel moisturizer along with a leave-in conditioner and my hair feels very strong and healthy.  I would recommend this product to any \\&quot;natural\\&quot; woman.</li>
    <li> Fast shipper love the product. I love the conditioner. I am sure I will be shopping from here in the future.</li>
    <li> I did like this conditioner for my hair, however, it did leave a slippery film in bath tub or shower. Having to wipe the tub after each use is annoying.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. I suffer from scalp psoriasis and this helps heal my breakouts and helps calm and heal open sores.</li>
    <li> Only drawbacks to me is it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft as what I thought before I bought it, also it sometimes takes a second wash to get it to lather and it sorta smells like aloe-vera but the scent could have been better.</li>
