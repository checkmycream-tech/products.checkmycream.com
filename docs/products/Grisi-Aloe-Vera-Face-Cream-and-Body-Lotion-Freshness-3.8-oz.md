      <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
      <li>This really is a great product, not oily, greasy and absorbs very well into the skin.  </li>
      <li>but it made my face break out, probably because the lotion is mostly oil.&lt;br</li>
      <li>If anyone knows where to get the \\&quot;real\\&quot; Moisturizing Beauty Cream, I&#x27;d love to know.  </li>
      <li>Nice, very cooling.</li>

      <li>On the Beauty Cream, aloe barbadensis extract is the second ingredient listed (meaning it makes up most of the product), while on the Face and Body Lotion the aloe is one of the last ingredients.  </li>

<li> Scent is a little &amp;#34;Old Spicey&amp;#34; but diminishes quickly leaving behind very soft skin.</li>
<li> It was one of the very few creams my skin would tolerate, and it actually improved my skin immensely.  </li>
<li> I am very disappointed to hear the real thing isn&#x27;t available.</li>
<li> Apparently it&#x27;s not made anymore, or at least it isn&#x27;t sold here in the US anymore.  </li>
<li> but alas, they sent me the same Face and Body</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t realize there is mineral oil, which is not good.  </li>

    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize there is mineral oil, which is not good.  Would order again if they take&lt;br /&gt;out the mineral oil!</li>
    <li> Very soft and therapeutic! I will order again.</li>
    <li> I have never found a cream that works so good for sunburns until a trip to mexico where I picked this stuff up. I now order it online whenever I run out. It&#x27;s a lot better ordering it in english as well!</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved the original Grisi Aloe Vera Moisturizing Beauty Cream.  It was one of the very few creams my skin would tolerate, and it actually improved my skin immensely.  When I ran out, I was happy to find it on Amazon and ordered it right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product that I received was Grisi Face and Body Lotion, which is in a jar that looks similar to the Moisturizing Beauty Cream - but the ingredients are entirely different.  On the Beauty Cream, aloe barbadensis extract is the second ingredient listed (meaning it makes up most of the product), while on the Face and Body Lotion the aloe is one of the last ingredients.  I tried the Face and Body Lotion but it made my face break out, probably because the lotion is mostly oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Beauty Cream from a different vendor, thinking that was the issue... but alas, they sent me the same Face and Body Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both vendors told me the same thing: THE MOISTURIZING BEAUTY CREAM IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE.  Apparently it&#x27;s not made anymore, or at least it isn&#x27;t sold here in the US anymore.  If anyone knows where to get the \\&quot;real\\&quot; Moisturizing Beauty Cream, I&#x27;d love to know.  I am very disappointed to hear the real thing isn&#x27;t available.</li>
    <li> I have had a rash on the T Zone of my face for several years. By chance I tried this product while on vacation at Palm Springs at the end of last year. This product is inexpensive and has cleared up the rash I have had for such a long time. I was amazed to find it on Amazon.com</li>
    <li> cream is not waiting for me , has the seal to the left lake,, quiero la original , la que tiene el sello lado izquierdo , no me gusto</li>
    <li> This really is a great product, not oily, greasy and absorbs very well into the skin.  My husband loves the stuff.</li>
    <li> Great product! I have sensitive skin and this works perfectly fine without causing breakouts.</li>
    <li> Amazing cream! I certainly will buy this again. This is posted by Morgan Hjelm mot Bill Hjelm I share the same account and I&#x27;m the one buying the item...</li>
    <li> My wife had been purchasing this from local grocery and pharmacies but she can no longer find it locally.  She thinks this cream is the best she has ever used (she does have beautful skin).  Will continue to order this from wherever she can find it.</li>
    <li> My wife and I have been using this product for 5 years. It has actually cleared up some age spots. It keeps my skin smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Really fast service, got exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best stuff ever</li>
    <li> The first time I purchased this item was in Mexico, I am so happy that i can continue to purchase through amazon.  I am very satisfied with this product and the seller.

I do recommend this seller and will purchase from them again.</li>
