<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I purchased the Clairsonic Pro over a year ago.  The plastic center device loosened so the brush didn&#x27;t turn efficiently.   It also made an unearthly rattling sound.  I liked the brush so much I bought another one from my dermatologist (cheaper on Amazon!).  On a whim, I decided to call the company and see if there was a \\&quot;fix\\&quot; for the first brush - don&#x27;t ask me why I didn&#x27;t think of it before.  The very first person I spoke to in customer service was incredibly nice and informed.  He told me they would ship me a BRAND NEW brush head for free!  As well as a new brush (which are costly little devils).  How terrific is that?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Clarisonic for about 6 months now, and am very pleased with the results.  My skin is much smoother and does not break out as frequently.  I&#x27;m not sure it has helped with any fine lines, but I think my pores are somewhat less noticeable and my skin is less oily.  I have very sensitive skin and was afraid the brush might irritate it, but haven&#x27;t had any problems at all.  I found that my results were very different using one of the included cleansers versus the others, so I&#x27;m going to continue using one of the Clarisonic cleansers.  The only downside is the price.  The brush itself is rather expensive, I find I have to replace the heads every 3-4 months, and I&#x27;ve had the best results with one of the pricey Clarisonic cleansers.  However, it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE my Clarisonic! I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and the difference in my skin is very noticeable. My skin is smoother, my pores are smaller, and I have not had a single blemish.</li>
    <li> The Clarisonic made an immediate difference in my skin.  My face seems much brighter and pores are minimized.  The brush produces such a relaxing sensation, I look forward to using it each evening!</li>
    <li> *J&#x27;s Wife* After receiving this package at a bridal shower, I was eager to try it out on my sensitive, acne prone face. Before this, i tended to use washcloths but i have to say, the brush makes a huge difference! I definitely cant say my face has cleared up entirely, but i realize now how poorly a job my washcloth was doing--it&#x27;s too harsh for everyday cleaning and doesn&#x27;t reach as deep as the Clarisonic brush. Side note- Now, i rarely get the *deep* cystic acne on my chin and forehead (right between the brows) Hurray! As a bit of advice, you don&#x27;t need to push down too hard (that was my first mistake) to ensure deep cleaning. Nothing bad will happen, but by doing so, you don&#x27;t allow the vibrating bristles to do as well a job of clearing the skin of debris. Also, i tried the trial cleansers but just use my own on the brush to do the job. I wanted to give it 5 stars, but the truth is that for some people, the price just simply wouldn&#x27;t be worth it.</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my friend.  She says she loves it!  She loves the convenience of leaving it in the shower and charging it overnight and it is ready for use for a month.  So far, no problems.  She recieved it in the mail brand new in the box.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for 8 months and found it to be easy to use and remarkably affective.  My facial skin is definitely softer, smaller pores and has less breakout.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this device!  The difference it has made in my skin texture is outstanding!  The only thing I do not like is that, one of the prongs where you put the brush head on has broken off.  I try to be very careful when switching heads from face and body but I noticed that one is missing.  I received this as a Christmas gift, so it should not being showing wear and tear already.  So far the missing prong has not created a problem with the brush heads or rotation.</li>
    <li> I stumbled upon this product by accident over a year ago.  I pondered if the price (then about $250) could possibly be worth it.  I took the plunge and was soooo glad I did.  It deep cleans your pores and exfoliates your skin like nobody&#x27;s business!  I always get compliments on my skin &amp; people think that I&#x27;m younger than my actual age.  It is so worth the price.  I use it in the shower with my Philosophy skin care products.  Once you try it, you will never be without one again.</li>
    <li> I waited a long time to purchase this product. I really see a difference in my skin. My skin is no longer dull looking, it feels soft and has a healthy glow. I use it once a day in the morning before my shower. I recently went to a upscale spa in my town to get a facial and they use this product! The facialist said the spa personnel highly recommend it for daily skin care, she said there were a lot of products out there that are full of hype but not this one. I agree.</li>
    <li> I have had other facial cleaning machines before and none are even close to this.  I would recommend to anyone who wants cleaner, softer skin.</li>
    <li> I received my Clarisonic as a gift, but was in the process of packing and never opened it.  I finally opened it (six months later) and was sad to find it did not accept a charge.  I called the customer service line and 2 questions later I was informed that I had received an old model and most likely there was an issue with the battery since it had been dormant for so long.  She then told me they would send a new unit to me right away.  I am curious if others that have had negative reviews ever called.    I have been told by friends that they are amazing to use and cannot wait to experience it myself.  If it is half as good as their customer service...I am in for a treat.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!!  It helps bring fresh skin to the surface, it exfoliates which is important in keeping your skin soft and supple.  The best thing is it is machine opearted so you dont have to do it yourself the machine does all the work so it works even better than doing yourself with a face brush.  Go out and get this product, everyone woman should have one.  Nalo Jones, professional makeup artist based in Los Angeles, [...]</li>
    <li> I was never a hard-core beauty fan. I like to keep things natural and simple. Only one time in my life did I ever go for a facial over an issue with break-outs, and the clinician said my skin was so great (from my home-made herbal facial scrub) that she didn&#x27;t need to treat me at all. (But she did sell me the expensive Obagi line.)    My point is, I already had the exfoliation deal under control. I&#x27;ve been dealing with my skin and health through diet and learning about detoxing. That&#x27;s where I learned about body brushing. Transfer that knowledge to the face and add sonic cleansing, and here I am buying this facial brush. And I LOVE IT!! It&#x27;s far superior to all the stuff I&#x27;ve done before. I actually look younger, glowing and fresh. It&#x27;s done a ton to boost my confidence. The fine lines I was developing as I age are almost all gone, and my son comments I look 10 years younger! I take it with me when I travel, and I swear by it. Save money from facials and get one of these--and get your facial done every day!    I did find when I started using it that in combination with Obagi&#x27;s foaming cleanser, it stripped my skin&#x27;s mantle and made it start over-producing sebum, that shiny oil we get on our skin. So I use Obagi in the morning and a non-soap cleanser (NutriBiotics Super Shower Gel) at night, and that seems to be the right balance.    As for break outs, I still have to watch my diet, but when I do and use this, my skin is so beautiful, I feel like a movie star!    UPDATE: It&#x27;s been three years now and I&#x27;m still in love with my ClariSonic! I have not had a single problem with it. I tried changing the brush heads as recommended at the beginning, and then just started soaking and washing the same one to avoid the extra cost and it&#x27;s completely fine. It still charges well and works perfectly. I still love my skin when I use it! If it ever breaks or needs replacing, I will certainly get another one. My skin is amazing and I will never be without it. And it really does makeyour skin absorb product like 10 times as much. It just sucks it right in. I still love it! After 3 years it is still my number one beauty secret!</li>
    <li> I bought many skin care products in the past. I have to say that this is the best investment I&#x27;ve ever made for my skin. I can see the difference on the first day! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have only had this item for a couple of days but I love, love, love it!  I take exceptionally good care of my skin (I use a number of Philosophy products) however this took my skin to another level.  I have always had tiny blackheads/clogged pores on my chin and I have already noticed those diminishing.  My skin feels so soft and looks so good.  My husband also tried it and it made a noticeable difference the first time (he doesn&#x27;t take good care of his skin).  I will continue to use most of my philosophy line with this product and I am convinced they will be more effective.  This item is expensive however if you compare it to the cost of a couple of peels, you will get your money&#x27;s worth in no time.  Highly recommended and so happy that I tried it!!!!</li>
    <li> Love the Clarisonic and already can see and feel improvements. Have purchased several more for family and friends. Highly recommend this product for good skin care.</li>
    <li> I purchased a clarisonic from amazon for $200.00 plus and the charger is not working. It has  not been used more than a year. That is a lot of money for something that will only last for a  year. Even in a beauty product that is a short shelve life. I will not recommend it to others.  Stick with a wash cloth and bank your dollars. very disappointed in the overall product. And not  getting any results from the company. I got a lemon or it is not a worthy product for women at  that price. Check out the drug store there are cheaper products with the same results.    I feel so used for paying that much for something I thought was a good product. So sad and mad.</li>
    <li> I use it to remove my makeup with my face wash and it does an excellent job.  The brush rinses clean with no problem.  Seems like my pores look better.  I have to hide it so my husband won&#x27;t use it!</li>
    <li> Best machine ever.  Have had for several years.  Still going strong.  Bought one for my daughter too.  I can tell when she has  not been using it as her skin is more dull and she gets blemishes.  When she uses the Clarisonic her skin is bright and no blemishes.</li>
    <li> I love what this does for my skin, but the product is not without its faults.  I returned the first one I received to the manufacturer because it stopped functioning correctly (most times would only function briefly at the lowest setting).  The replacement they sent to me was functioning perfectly for the first few days, but now it is on the fritz as well (won&#x27;t turn on at times and other times won&#x27;t stay on for long enough).  I will be calling the manufacturer again for further instructions/suggestions.</li>
    <li> Purchased:  July 2008    Positives:  Bought it for myself - even at 59 continue to get pimples, etc.  Need to look professional in my work.  Very pleased with the results - gradually eliminating small bumps.  My wife was skeptical but she is now using it.    Deltas:  None.    Overall:  I encourage wives to purchase it for husbands who are often with clients.</li>
    <li> I got great results from the clarisonic. I bought it in November 2007. And then it died in April 2008. I used it daily, kept it clean, and charged it as recommended. It no longer takes a charge. So I should send it back to get it fixed right?&lt;br /&gt;Wrong. I&#x27;ve been using a $12 supracor to clean my face and am getting way better exfoliation and results than the clarisonic. This new item is easier to clean and it&#x27;s less expensive to get two supracors than it is to get one clarisonic replacement brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clarisonic: I&#x27;m so over you and your $200 price tag and $25 replacement brushes.</li>
    <li> I just love this product.  Every once and a while I will forget to charge it and I am so disappointed when I  have to wash my face without it!!  As far as all the claims go- I haven&#x27;t seen a huge reduction in pores or fine lines but I sure do feel like my face is getting cleaner which makes me feel really good.  My skin does feel smoother but that could be a combination of the face brush and the Alpha-hydroxy product I am using.  None the less I am very happy with it and it was very worth it!  One thing I do have to say is that I believe that the face wash that comes with it is very overpriced and nothing really special.  After the small sample bottle it came with was gone I just started using my regular face wash with it and realized that there was nothing better about theirs.  Don&#x27;t waste your money thinking you have to spend $25 on their face wash to get better results!  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> This is my second Clarisonic.  I lost my first one in a fire, and couldn&#x27;t live without getting a new one.  It makes my skin feel so clean and healthy.</li>
    <li> When I first received my Clarisonic, I loved it. Then less than a year later it died, it wouldn&#x27;t charge any longer. I noticed I was not the only one who had this problem when I started to read other reviews.    I called Clarisonic and first found out that my unit was not under warrantly because I did NOT buy it from a approved dealer. Sorry Amazon not on the list. Then when I inquired how I can get the unit serviced they told me there is no way to service it. It is only replaceable and with an additional $195 I can have a brand new one. NO WAY. So even if you were willing to pay for it to be serviced you don&#x27;t even have that option.      I was furious! So Buyer Beware!!! Beware of where you buy your Clarisonic and Beware that Clarisonic does not stand by their product.    Think about it, even if you bought it from an authorized dealer and you were just one day past your warranty, you would have to cough up another $195. My argument is: for a unit that is so expensive it should be serviceable.     To top it off the customer service rep that I spoke with told me I should go buy a $35 unit if I have a problem spending so much. I will admit that I had reservations about spending so much on the unit, but I thought by spending that much money I was getting something that was reliable and backed by a company that would support its product.    I have a no name unit that I have had for over 8 years and it works just fine. Clarisonic you can keep your over priced scrub brush. I&#x27;ll buy a $35 dollar unit and be much happier.    Tell all your friends!  Lets not let this company get away with shotty Business Ethics. This is no way to run a business and sell products especially when they have received so much commercial publicity and endorsements.</li>
    <li> I had been eyeing this thing for over a year, not really willing to spend an exhorbitant amount of money on something to clean my face.  One day I took a look at all of the facial cleansers I&#x27;ve bought on impulse and realized that I was spending just as much on face creams every few months....so I invested money in the Clarisonic pro.  It arrived in less than 5 days, and I&#x27;ve now been using it for a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the easiest thing to use in the world.  Takes less than 3 minutes to wash your face and neck, cleans off like a dream, and can be used with any cleanser that isn&#x27;t grainy (no scrubs).  I use makeup remover to take off my eye makeup, then use the Clarisonic.  I do not ever recall my skin feeling as smooth and clean as it does now.  I used to wash my face thoroughly with a washcloth and cleansers, and exfolliate too, and even then when I dried my face, makeup or dirt would still be on the towel.  Now....?  Nope.  Completely clean.  My moisturizers and serums go on and soak right in.  I use less of both, because my skin absorbs it so well now that it&#x27;s completely clean.  My pores look smaller; I haven&#x27;t had a breakout this month even though I normally would; and I haven&#x27;t had to touch up my mineral veil in the middle of the day, which is unusual for me, Ms. Supergreasyface.  Seems that getting my skin really clean is helping my skin not produce excess oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I&#x27;d bought it earlier...........</li>
    <li> I packed all of my exfoliating cleansers, acne treatments, and every other expensive facial product I had bought and gave them away! After using the Clarasonic for only two days, my skin is noticeably smoother and my breakouts are fading. I have tried everything from ProActive to expensive monthly facials at a spa. This product (Clarasonic) has saved me so much money!!!! It has really helped me feel great about my skin and I don&#x27;t know what I would have done if I had not  discovered this!!!!</li>
    <li> I have oily sensitive skin and this is my solution to having the best skin I have ever had in my life. I cant use just any product and I have searched high and low for a product that will exfoliate my skin without creating a rash all over. The Clarisonic is it! I have been using it for over a month now without any complications and I have gotten so many compliments on my clear and healthy looking skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Clarisonic for several months, and I have been so pleased with how easy it is to use, and with the astounding results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first got the Clarisonic when I sent into the salon where I get my facials and dermabrasion treatments. I saw a pamphlet for it, and the salon owner recommended it.  Even though this product is not cheap, I figured if this did work, it would save me a lot of money since the salon treatments are so expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work. I have tried products similar to this in the past, and have stopped using them either because they felt too flimsy, or because they were too complicated and messy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t - it&#x27;s a snap. It&#x27;s heavy duty, and it&#x27;s so easy to use and clean. I use it every night, and sometimes in the morning, and my face is noticeably  smoother and my pores look smaller - especially around my nose and chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result, I now no longer go in to have facials or any other skin treatments at that salon, since this seems to do the trick. (Talk about a conflict of interest for the salon owner!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of caution - I have normal to dry skin. If you have very sensitive skin, this may be a little rough, but the Clarisonic does come with an extra gentle brush and you can put it on slow setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I am highly highly highly recommending this product. It&#x27;s not a gimmick, you won&#x27;t be looking for the next new thing because this works and is simple to use, and you will see a difference in your skin. (I don&#x27;t care how much you wash your face - you will see all the dirt on the brush when are finishing up.) It does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> This company is not reputable. They charged me $225.00 for a $14.95 trial. When I tried to cancel and get a refund, they became non-responsive. I&#x27;m still trying to get my money back but unfortunately I paid with my debit card. S Wilkinson, Eufaula, Alabama</li>
    <li> I do like the Clarisonic , it is fun to use and it feels really good. I was happy that it was $50 cheaper on Amazon, also no tax and free shipping, what a deal! It does clean your skin very well but you still have to wipe off the cleansing lotion after use, and although I have been using it for a few weeks it does not get rid of discolorations in the skin, I still have red patches. It does seem that it makes it easier for your day or night cream to penetrate the skin. Overall I like it as a gadget but I don&#x27;t think it does wonders..............</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about buying this product because of its price and thinking it was another gimmic.  In my early twenties I have been to different dermatologists and could still not find the answer. I have had every facial problem from oily skin, acne, large blemishes, extreme dryness, redness and irritation and so forth.  No product seemed to be able to cure it all.  I got this product and have been using it for one week and see results already.  My skin feels cleaner and fresher. I use it once or twice a day, in the shower or any time.  After I just pat my face dry, apply a mild acne cream and then my facial lotion.    I had been using prescriptions, soap, ex foliating washes, etc. nothing seemed to work. This so far has been great!  People see your face everyday, you might as well spend the money and try something that could really work.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Clarisonic Pro three weeks ago and have used it once a day since then. I did my homework and researched this product before purchasing. I have to say, when it comes to being an avid hunter for the perfect remedy for less than perfect skin, I&#x27;m an expert. I have been experiencing the 40-something freak-out-skin-funk. I have a NicoleKidman-type complexion and my skin never looked worse in all my life! I tried everything to correct it, including prescription creams, changing make-up brands, changing moisturizers, not using SPF, new make-up brushes, peels, on and on. Long story short, from the very first scrub to the 3rd week, my skin feels better, looks better, is more even, redness is almost gone and no more little mosquito-type bumps. Yeah, it&#x27;s expensive, but not as expensive as getting bi-monthly facial treatments, chemical peels or micro-dermabrasions. This is so worth the self-indulgence. I&#x27;ve tried all of the trial size facial cleansers that come the unit. They don&#x27;t work any better than my $1.99 Basis Facial Bar Soap for sensitive skin. I use my Clarisonic Pro at night only. My skin is just too sensitive for twice a day use. And the claim is absolutely correct regarding moisturizers performing better. After several uses, you literally remove the first layer of dead skin, flakes, and dry patches that reveal smooth, fresh, shiny skin. Once you apply your moisturizer, you&#x27;ll be amazed at how it soaks in instead of just sitting there not doing anything. Like others advise, use a good night time moisturizer or whatever is right for your skin type, since that is when your skin is most likely to benefit absorption and the properties of your product. I like DermaE Night Time Creme for about $20 at most WholeFoods or Internet. I use an organic $10 daily moisturizer with 20SPF. I&#x27;m thrilled to be my own esthetician and perform spa-worthy treatments in 30 seconds a day in my own bathroom.</li>
    <li> One of the best beauty tools I have ever purchased. Change the head every two months. Your skin will feel amazing</li>
    <li> Positives  Leaves skin very smooth    Negatives  Even from the start only 2 of the 3 speeds worked and timer function only worked at the high speed.  After a couple of months the high speed would function only some of the time.  After a year and half most of the time only the slow speed works.</li>
    <li> I read about this product in a magazine but was a little hesitant because of the price. I went to amazon and read the reviews, after that I decided to give it a shot. After a couple of days I began to see the results!! My skin is clearer and I am really happy with my Clarisonic. Unlike the other reviewer, I was able to resgister my product and I received my free brush head in the mail soon after that.</li>
    <li> This skin care cleaning system gets your face really clean. It takes off all of your make-up. I use it 1 or 2 times a day. My face feels great!</li>
    <li> I heard about this product from Oprah&#x27;s favorites.  I was under the impression the brush would spin to exfoliate and cleanse.  It simply vibrates.   This is no better than my Neutrogena face brush which also vibrates but seems to work fine at $29 compared to $170+.  I also found the size quite large for holding in your hand to cleanse.  I returned it and am sticking with the Neutrogena brush.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the Clarisonic PRO, and have noticed smoother, softer skin that absorbs moisturizer like crazy!  It took a little getting used to the timer settings, and I can&#x27;t seem to make it over my whole face thoroughly in the pre-set time periods.  Luckily, there is a way around the pre-sets so you can go for as long as you like.  That being said, many with normal skin may find the 1 and 2-minute settings just fine.  I struggled with little white protruding needle-like clogged pores on my chin and around my nose for years, and exfoliants never worked very well on this strange condition.  Fortunately, Clarisonic has completely cleared this problem up, and I only use it once per day for about 3 minutes (focusing especially on my chin and around my nose on the \\&quot;high\\&quot; power setting).  One last thing - I can&#x27;t imagine using any brush head other than the sensitive.  I recommend this product highly despite the big expense.</li>
    <li> Not only does this product feel great while you&#x27;re using it, my skin glows now, which makes me feel great 24-7! I use it in the shower and it&#x27;s so easy. Doesn&#x27;t need to be recharged very often but feels like it takes a long time when it does need it...24 hours the first time and 12 hours(??) all subsequent times. Great exfoliation and gentle at the same time. My skin feels so soft. My new favorite thing!!!</li>
    <li> I love the Clarisonic skin care system.It is quite costly, but I think it is really worth it. My skin has never felt or looked this good in years. It will save me a fortune in facials. I love the way it prepares my skin for my moisturizer. It just soaks it up instead of just smearing on the surface. My make up goes on beautifully. I love it so much that I am buying each one of my 2 daughters a clarisonic for the holidays.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist mentioned this item to me, and suggested I purchase one. It sells for $199 at most any place I checked. Decided to check amazon.com for a better deal and I got it - $149! I could tell after the first use the difference in how smooth my face felt. I have been using it for about 3 months now (twice a day). I love it. Most of them come with small tubes of cleansers. I tried them and they are fine but I use my regular cleanser. Not to be used with scrubs.  *I have rosacea and dry skin and it has helped my face so much.</li>
    <li> Ive owned the Clarisonic Mia for 8 months and it no longer will hold a charge.  Called customer service and they wont do anything about it. I can&#x27;t believe I paid big bucks for something that the company wont stand behind.Im reading more and more complaints about their short lived batteries. I was very happy with the way my skin looks and its radiance,  but not sure if I want to buy another one and chance it.</li>
    <li> BUYERS, BEWARE!  I experienced the same problem that many people have reported:  Battery will not hold a charge and is not replaceable, which is REALLY stupid, Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> I have had this brush for many years and it still works fine.  I also can use it in the shower.  It will leave your skin feeling like a baby&#x27;s behind if you use it regularly.</li>
