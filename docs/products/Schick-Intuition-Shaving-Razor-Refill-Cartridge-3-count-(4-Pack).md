      <li>I just think that this particular one runs out faster.</li>
      <li>Great price...to expensive in the stores.</li>
      <li>but since people say that they only last two shaves and my head still looks fine</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving three stars because these are clearly knock off blades</li>
      <li>but then I&#x27;ve only shaved my legs once with the new head</li>
      <li>The sensitive skin ones last a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
      <li>this seller sold the sensitive skin style for the same price is probably buy it from them.</li>

    <li> Perfect! Fit my Intuition razor and the price is the cheapest I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
    <li> Fast! Nicely packed with a bonus gift of tea. Nice!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and wife loves the blades.</li>
    <li> I do not believe these are authentic!</li>
    <li> Both my daughter and I use Schick Intuition Razors and I decided to give this a try on Amazon.  This is a great deal and it shipped very quickly.  We are now set for awhile and don&#x27;t have to try and wait for a sale at our local stores.</li>
    <li> No need for shaving cream love this product!</li>
    <li> These are my favorite razors. I can expect to remain nick free even in a hurry. If the soap on them lasted longer then 2 shaves they would get 5 stars. They smell very nice and shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> The wife was happy to get these on Amazon. Great price compared to in the store.</li>
    <li> The price is good but these didn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the sensitive skin ones. I dint think it&#x27;s this sellers product that&#x27;s poor. I just think that this particular one runs out faster. The sensitive skin ones last a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;If this seller sold the sensitive skin style for the same price is probably buy it from them.</li>
    <li> There are up to 14 dollars in the store each pack</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving three stars because these are clearly knock off blades and they should just be honest and sell them that way. It&#x27;s still a really great deal and they fit fine on my real Intuition razor body. I&#x27;ve heard they don&#x27;t last as long. I haven&#x27;t experienced that myself but then I&#x27;ve only shaved my legs once with the new head but since people say that they only last two shaves and my head still looks fine I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s a misnomer. Unless your talking about the more um you know extensive shaving we ladies often do, in that case two shaves worth of soap would be accurate of the actual schick blades as well.</li>
    <li> Best price anywhere. I love these razors!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how genuine this product is. It came with labels from China. But I supposed everything is made in China these days. Also the soap bars around the razor seem to crumble more easily than the ones I buy from the store.. But I like buying in bulk!!!</li>
    <li> Love these, use them all the time!</li>
    <li> Having arthritis in my hands, these razors are really the best!</li>
    <li> Poor product, blades aren&#x27;t sharp. Very disappointed, makes me question if it&#x27;s a knock off.</li>

    <li> Absolutely love this product and finding this fantastic deal on Amazon just made it all that much better. It came quickly and exactly as described!</li>
    <li> These are really nice refills love the selection.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used anything else in over 10 years.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, wonderful price and exceptional shipping speed.</li>
    <li> Great price...to expensive in the stores.</li>
    <li> very affordable and fast shipping</li>
    <li> work great leave my legs smooth as silk</li>
