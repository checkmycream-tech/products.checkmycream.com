      <li>I LOVE</li>
      <li>so you that don&#x27;t might have better results than me :)</li>
      <li>i went to the swiss botany website and sent them an email more then a month ago.  </li>
      <li>my breast feel more tighter with the elasticity.</li>
      <li>coffee and soda drinks works better no caffeine.</li>
      <li>Thank you for making such a great and effective product available!</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;m pretty impressed!  </li>
      <li>I loved the fact that it absorbed quickly</li>
      <li>Fantastic product that immediately and noticeably affected the breast tissue.</li>
      <li>I got the product quickly, smooth transaction.</li>
      <li>I received this for free in return for a review.</li>
      <li>The product was sent in a timey matter and securely packed.</li>
      <li>I also really like the fact that it absorbs nicely and doesn&#x27;t feel at all greasy or sticky.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s definitely worth a try. :)</li>
      <li>I use it mostly after my shower and right before I sleep.</li>
      <li>The serum absorbs easily and has a light, pretty smell.</li>
      <li>It takes about 3-6 mos for full results.</li>
      <li>and although my boobs doesn&#x27;t need lifting they&#x27;re full (36DD).</li>
      <li>I also see that its working on my breasts, they feel full and i can see blooming cleavage now.</li>
      <li>I have my old, pretty boobs back and am *very*  happy about it.</li>
      <li>already feel firmer it absorbs quickly and non greasy</li>
      <li>This may also help add more results which I&#x27;ve just been researching and learning more about essential oils, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Bust</li>
      <li>, this serum is not greasy at all and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>When I came across this, I was very interested in how it would work for me.</li>
      <li>But on the plus side there was no crazy side effects and the serum had a pleasent smell.</li>
      <li>just began using the product and thus far notice more definition, ie volume with just two weeks of usage.</li>
      <li>I totally Love the results so far.</li>
      <li>however I said what the heck its worth a try.</li>
      <li>Too early to tell for any long term results, but since I&#x27;ve already seen results, I am very pleased with this purchase!</li>
      <li>but it was a little if doz be more much better</li>
      <li>this is great product i have only used it for a week long, and i really see the change on my breast,  lifting and perky and more soft</li>
      <li>I was paying close attention the first couple of days, but as the application became routine I didn&#x27;t bother to do any self</li>
      <li>Just make sure that you observe proper sleep and nutrition (just my assumption), take a lot of fluids and greens/fruits.</li>
      <li>I just started using it, so I don&#x27;t know yet about results, but it looks promising!</li>
      <li>Before writing this review I have measured my breasts to see if the sizes increased, unfortunately no increased yet.</li>
      <li>It says it firms and lifts the bust which is exactly what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
      <li>This is my first online review.</li>
      <li>first bottle serum is just a hook up to make you think it will work.&lt;br /&gt;after</li>
      <li>Definitely recommend this product to any mom who needs help getting back those full, perky breasts after breastfeeding! :)</li>
      <li>I have rarely seen a product live up to</li>
      <li>I really liked the product i am almost half way through this product</li>
      <li>I only gave four stars because I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a month and it will take another month or more for full results.</li>
      <li>Do Not Use it if you are Pregnant or Nursing.&lt;br /&gt;To get firm and healthy breasts</li>
      <li>I was sincerely looking something for the girls to be a little more perky, if it was possible.</li>
      <li>Is very sticky and does not work</li>
      <li>and I really appreciate the swift shipping.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for enlargement, however I still have yet to see much of that.</li>
      <li>but it wasn&#x27;t doing much.</li>
      <li>I also cut out real sugar  </li>
      <li>I really did not know if this would work</li>
      <li>I usually don&#x27;t use products like this, but I was very pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>My breasts are much smoother and feel lighter.</li>
      <li>I am 46 years old with weight fluctuations and this product really does firm nicely.</li>
      <li>This little oil has already made a big change in my skin and the girls are looking good again.</li>
      <li>I noticed my breast are more firmed, and slight lift up.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m a half cup larger!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(here&#x27;s the link if it helps: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OKY07XM/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1) which I take twice daily for the last four months or more.</li>
      <li>I ordered this with high hopes</li>
      <li>so I switched to applying to both breast only at night and the right twice a day.</li>
      <li>I think that is a realistic result and so far it&#x27;s meeting my expectations.</li>
      <li>A little bit goes a long way, it spreads easy and absorbs quickly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> my wife loved this stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve taken PM capsules, and thought the liquid would be even more effective.  After massaging into my breasts twice a day for six weeks, there&#x27;s no noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 19 with a 7 month old daughter and after breastfeeding my breasts were really starting to sag. I stopped breastfeeding my daughter when she was almost 3 months since I had no more milk to give. I was disappointed I couldn&#x27;t feed her longer but just a few days after I stooped breastfeeding her, my breasts were shrinking day by day. I felt miserable and really depressed about how I went from 40DDD to 34D almost C. My breasts had no elasticity either. It got to the point where I HAD to buy something. I bought a very supportive bra but it wasn&#x27;t doing much. When I came across this, I was very interested in how it would work for me. It&#x27;s only been 4 days and I definitely feel the results! My breasts are much smoother and feel lighter. The serum also gives off a cooling sensation. Definitely recommend this product to any mom who needs help getting back those full, perky breasts after breastfeeding! :)</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t looking for something for my breast to be more enlarged. I was sincerely looking something for the girls to be a little more perky, if it was possible. YIKES! I don&#x27;t know how long I&#x27;ve been using this, just a couple of weeks, less than a month. I was paying close attention the first couple of days, but as the application became routine I didn&#x27;t bother to do any self examinations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night I took off my bra under my top. As the girls were free for a while (other than in a sleeping position), I felt a sudden difference, so I went to my bathroom to look in the mirror. I&#x27;m still in disbelief this morning as I&#x27;ve been bra less since last night and the girls still look perky...and they are certainly a tad bit bigger. I&#x27;m a C-cup...but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m a half cup larger!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even my husband noticed last night when I removed my bra!</li>
    <li> This is the second time buying this serum. I love this. In a little over 2 WEEKS my breast were so much fuller and firmer. I&#x27;ve bought other breast serums before and this is the first time in does what it promise.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it just over a month. I was hoping for enlargement, however I still have yet to see much of that. Not sure if I should use it longer however the bottle is almost out. Defiantly can see firmness.</li>
    <li> NO DEVELOPMENT RESULTS*</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle and still have high hopes.  I will keep everyone updated.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27; see no progress srry everyone&#x27;s body is different tho</li>
    <li> Didnt notice a changed used everyday.</li>
    <li> sorry to said but this product does not work.  in good faith and knowing that it was not working i give it a full try.  i got 5 bottles so far.  i think after the first bottle all serums are fake. first bottle serum is just a hook up to make you think it will work.&lt;br /&gt;after i posted my review some reply contact us but give me no number or email to do so.  i went to the swiss botany website and sent them an email more then a month ago.  no one has answer me so far.&lt;br /&gt;so 100% money back guarantee is a scam</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for c week now I can admit I feel a bit firmer my breast feel more tighter with the elasticity. I&#x27;ll give an update not a month I plan to order more</li>
    <li> Used both bottles that I bought. Not much improvemental. Every one body is different</li>
    <li> I waited a while to write this review. Very good product that does what it says. I am 46 years old with weight fluctuations and this product really does firm nicely.</li>
    <li> Is very sticky and does not work</li>
    <li> Delivery was excellent.  Results uncertain.</li>
    <li> In my first week of use i experienced headaches and itchiness around breast area but after that week these effects were gradually disappearing. Just make sure that you observe proper sleep and nutrition (just my assumption), take a lot of fluids and greens/fruits. :0) I also see that its working on my breasts, they feel full and i can see blooming cleavage now. Looking forward to he next purchase.</li>
    <li> waiting for results....</li>
    <li> I chose this product because it doesn&#x27;t make outlandish claims. It says it firms and lifts the bust which is exactly what I&#x27;m looking for. I think that is a realistic result and so far it&#x27;s meeting my expectations. I also really like the fact that it absorbs nicely and doesn&#x27;t feel at all greasy or sticky. A big plus for me is that this product is organic and herbal and comes with a guarantee. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Tightening did not seem to happen nor did any lifting seem visible.  A bit disappointed. Hopefully it works for someone.</li>
    <li> Not really sure yet and do not know how much to use</li>
    <li> I received this for free in return for a review. I Love this. I have used it for a week and notice a difference!</li>
    <li> It not working at all I just wAisted my money</li>
    <li> I really liked the product i am almost half way through this product and i can see the difference it made to my body. i recommend this breast enhancement serum for everyone one who needs it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any benefit from this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought a lot of stuff from Amazon concerning breast&#x27;s! This stuff works!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working and I&#x27;m a 44 dd/E!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t put a review till now i was waiting for a week for results on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well this is great product i have only used it for a week long, and i really see the change on my breast,  lifting and perky and more soft my husband had seen the difference on my breast.&lt;br /&gt;I did order two bottles just in case the price change , but I&#x27;m happy and just my first week . I have two daughters one 10 years And 5 years old after breastfeeding both of my breast had a big change. But with this product i know it will change for better and i have stretch marks and now the are slowly disapiring . I will keep you lady&#x27;s posted. Just remember no to drink coffee and soda drinks works better no caffeine.</li>
    <li> I started using this product for one month. It works! I have seen lifting. In so happy . I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s and lost a lot of weight a few years ago. I&#x27;ve had sagging breast. This product has lifted it about 40% . I will still use it . I like that it doesn&#x27;t cause growth but just lifting. It also smells good. I usually get sick of smells . I use it mostly after my shower and right before I sleep. It&#x27;s on my bed stand for consistency usage. 4 stars because 5 stars would mean 100% lift</li>
    <li> it makes my breast soft, but does not help it grow as i wished ...i am on estrogen treatments and testoserum blockers so maybe it takes loner....brandie, edith new daughter previous son......brandie</li>
    <li> Did not work. Did give me acne breakouts on my chest.</li>
    <li> I had always been a cup DD, but after breastfeeding and hitting 40&#x27;s my breast tissue lost it&#x27;s collagen and started sagging. This little oil has already made a big change in my skin and the girls are looking good again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a mom but I model and although my boobs doesn&#x27;t need lifting they&#x27;re full (36DD). I wanted some extra firming as gym wasn&#x27;t helping much and I hate push ups. I was a bit skeptical about trying this however I said what the heck its worth a try. I have only been using this product for three days and already results are kicking in boobs already feel firmer it absorbs quickly and non greasy I LOVE IT will definitely purchase again without  doubt. Thanks to the awesome people that created this products.</li>
    <li> I have had a problem with a rash.  Also have not had any improvement in firming.</li>
    <li> Arrived just as promised and so far so good on the results !! Thank you !! Can&#x27;t wait to see how it turns out !!!</li>
    <li> only a 3 star cause haven&#x27;t seen any improvement but only been about 12 days</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I just discovered I am unable to use this product due to the side effects. When I apply, even in the smallest amounts, I get an extremely terrible headache. I came to this discover after using the product a few time and then stopping use to see if it was, in fact, the product. Once I stopped using the product, the headaches disappeared. Once I started applying the product again, the headaches returned, and not just for a day put a few days. So, this product is a bust (no pun intended) for me. The product was sent in a timey matter and securely packed. Two stars for the product since I am unable to use it, I can not truthfully comment on its abilities.</li>
    <li> I just want to help. I have not bought this BTW but I&#x27;ve been doing research on this kind of breast enlargement for a while now and what I&#x27;ve found is everyone of these enlargement products have a majority of the same ingredients but I&#x27;ve learned how to use them in conjunction with your cycle and I can say I&#x27;ve made a difference to myself on my own! Use milk thistle for at least 2 weeks prior  to your starting day (this helps balance your hormones and prepare for  the herbs you&#x27;re about to start taking) and take more than suggested dosage (I used bustmaxx  and actually got it to work pretty fast by taking 3x what the bottle said. Put it to you ladies this way an inch a week! I even stopped a week and the results have sustained and I&#x27;ve had absolutely no weight gain anywhere else. I also cut out real sugar  ( it supposedly turns to testosterone in the female body after you&#x27;ve had what your body needs each day) I smoke and drink coffee everyday  so you that don&#x27;t might have better results than me :)</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about it working but my fiance is crazy about the results</li>
    <li> really liked the product hope it helps you guys as well.</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing! I have experienced great results in skin texture and firmness. It non greasy and absorbs totally</li>
    <li> no results but its only been a month - skin is softer and maybe a lil tighter</li>
    <li> just began using the product and thus far notice more definition, ie volume with just two weeks of usage. I actually have some cleavage! look forward to seeing stronger results as the weeks go on.</li>
    <li> Pueraria Mirifica is a good product, I have been using it for about 3 weeks now. I noticed my breast are more firmed, and slight lift up. I was hoping my breasts will be bigger. I have measured the size of my breast before I started to use the product. Before writing this review I have measured my breasts to see if the sizes increased, unfortunately no increased yet. I may try to use it for few months see if I get increase size result that I&#x27;m after. I will recommend  Pueraria Mirifica Serum if you want firm breasts. I hope this review help</li>
    <li> The product did not work for me at all. Im glad everybody else had good results. But on the plus side there was no crazy side effects and the serum had a pleasent smell.</li>
    <li> I got the product quickly, smooth transaction. I just started using it, so I don&#x27;t know yet about results, but it looks promising!</li>
    <li> Just started using it seems like it&#x27;s working</li>
    <li> So far, I&#x27;m pretty impressed!  I&#x27;ve only been using for about week and a half, but I&#x27;m definitely noticing a difference. I&#x27;m a mom of two who breastfed both children and my chest just isn&#x27;t what it used to be! After finally loosing all my &amp;#34;baby-wieght&amp;#34; I had basically deflated into nothing and needed a surgery-free method to help lift and maybe add a bit if possible. This seems to be helping add some firmness for sure. Although I haven&#x27;t had an extreme increase in volume, I did notice that after the first week my left breast seemed slightly larger than my right (it&#x27;s always been an over-achiever) so I switched to applying to both breast only at night and the right twice a day. This seemed to do the trick since they look evened out again and means that I am definitely gaining a little volume. I feel like this is a worse case scenario and it was easily fixed by changing the application amounts. Too early to tell for any long term results, but since I&#x27;ve already seen results, I am very pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product that immediately and noticeably affected the breast tissue. I have within a short time (a couple of weeks) seen visible change, a roundness and firmness where there was some loss of volume, slackness if you will, (I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s) before. I have rarely seen a product live up to it&#x27;s promise the way this one has. I have my old, pretty boobs back and am *very*  happy about it. Will definitely not be without this product. Thank you for making such a great and effective product available!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with your product and I really appreciate the swift shipping. Will recommend your product to friends.</li>
    <li> I totally Love the results so far.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me but that may be because my problems are caused by weight gain and not a hormonal imbalance. However, Swiss Botany&#x27;s customer service is great. I received a refund less than 24 hours after I told them I was unsatisfied so it&#x27;s definitely worth a try. :)</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t use products like this, but I was very pleased with the results. After having two kids I felt like I needed a little lift. This Pueraria Mirifica gave me just what I needed.  I loved the fact that it absorbed quickly so I could use it before getting dressed in the morning and I wasn&#x27;t reminded it was there all day. It didn&#x27;t transfer to my clothing and it wasn&#x27;t greasy feeling as some other products can be. I noticed immediately that it made my skin feel smoother and it gave me the lift I needed. I give this product an A++ and would recommend it to anyone who needs some lifting and firming! A little bit goes a long way, it spreads easy and absorbs quickly. You can&#x27;t go wrong with the price, the bottle will last a long time!</li>
    <li> Great quality!  Great store!</li>
    <li> This is my first online review. I only gave four stars because I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a month and it will take another month or more for full results. I&#x27;m looking forward to it. I use it in conjunction with PM (Pueraria Mirifica) 500mg (here&#x27;s the link if it helps: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OKY07XM/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1) which I take twice daily for the last four months or more. It takes about 3-6 mos for full results. It&#x27;s definitely helped with my night sweats (I am in my mid-20&#x27;s) and acne and definite notice in breast size; though I&#x27;m looking forward to more increase and with this product (PM serum) should maximize the results and help firm and hopefully give some lift. I use the products according to the recommended directions.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re breasts will be tender, just means they&#x27;re growing like growing pains as a kid. This may also help add more results which I&#x27;ve just been researching and learning more about essential oils, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Bust Firming Oil Blend&lt;br /&gt;10 drops Grapeseed Essential Oil&lt;br /&gt;10 drops Geranium Essential Oil&lt;br /&gt;5 drops Clary Sage Essential Oil&lt;br /&gt;5 drops Fenugreek Seeds Oil&lt;br /&gt;Mix them all together and store in a dark amber glass bottle. Massage your breasts&lt;br /&gt;with this blend. Do Not Use it if you are Pregnant or Nursing.&lt;br /&gt;To get firm and healthy breasts you can also use this Papaya Almond mask once in&lt;br /&gt;a while: Grate 1 small cucumber, squeeze the juice and mix it with 1 Tbsp. Almond Meal and&lt;br /&gt;a few cubes of ripe Papaya. Mix them all well and apply it to your breasts. Rinse off&lt;br /&gt;after 20 minutes.</li>
    <li> I ordered this with high hopes but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t do much for me.  Due to heavy travel I was not able to try it right away, but when I eventually did  I had some side effects, my breast area became very red, then a few hours later I felt a bit ditsy/dizzy.  I know for sure it was the Pueraria Marifica Serum because I did discontinue it for a few days then tried again and had the same symptoms.  Unfortunately I will not use this again.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product!  Swiss Botany handled my order in a prompt and efficient manner and it arrived without delay.  I am currently using the product and have noticed less sagging and a firmer bust line, so I give them a Five Star rating!</li>
    <li> does not work at all! total hype!</li>
    <li> Bought this to use preemptively against sagging. The serum absorbs easily and has a light, pretty smell. It makes my skin feel amazing! Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Wow my chest looks one size bigger. I really did not know if this would work</li>
    <li> I like the product but it was a little if doz be more much better</li>
    <li> its too spensive dont work good</li>
    <li> Great product and shipping. A+</li>
    <li> I have to be honest and I have to say that it seems to be working, I jus bought it last week and I am starting to see some changes I cant wait to see final results, since the first use I started to feel something different in my boobs, this serum is not greasy at all and absorbs quickly.</li>
