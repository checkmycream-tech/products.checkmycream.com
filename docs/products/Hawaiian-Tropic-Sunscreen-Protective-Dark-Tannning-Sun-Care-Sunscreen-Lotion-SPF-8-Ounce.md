      <li>A nice touch is that the opening is at the bottom so when you go to use it, it is easy to get out of the bottle.</li>
      <li>I purchased some for myself and am still pleased. &#x3D; )</li>
      <li>Love this stuff..</li>
      <li>It has one of the better smelling sunscreens.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t like the GOOFY &amp;#34; cap &amp;#34; on the top..............</li>
      <li>I love this and would recommend this for anyone trying to avoid sunburns but still looking to get a tan.</li>
      <li>I had realized that my face, top of ears, and shoulders looked as if they were burnt without the pain.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using for many years and like it a lot.</li>
      <li>I love this tanning lotion.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE Hawaiian Tropic.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this product....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s working on my sexy skin.</li>
      <li>I prefer the original strong Hawaiian Tropic scents.  </li>
      <li>If you like light coconut scents, you&#x27;ll enjoy this.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m fair skinned, but even after spending an hour in the direct sunlight, I didn&#x27;t burn at all.  </li>
      <li>but it worked well at protection even on a hot strong summers day</li>
      <li>and nothing I&#x27;ve tried is more moisturizing and provides more protection for daily use.</li>
      <li>As i said it only UVB protection the whole spectrum is UVA/UVB , your still getting great protection</li>
      <li>However, I must admit it takes some rubbing before it gets spread out well and absorbed.</li>
      <li>Still my favorite for light coverage and because it&#x27;s a lotion it helps keep your skin from getting too dry.</li>
      <li>but i would still like UVA/UVB more than this which you can find only problem</li>
      <li>The first day I used this I forgot to reapply and at the end of the day of being at the water park with my kids</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care how much you try to rub it in, more white streaks appear.</li>
      <li>Smells great and is good for those with a base tan or a light-med tan.</li>
      <li>Hawaiian Tropic Sun definitely has become my new favorite.</li>
      <li>but it works very well</li>
      <li>I really needed a tan</li>
      <li>HT&#x27;s Sun Tanning Sunscreen Lotion moisturizes well without the greasiness and offers a noticeable golden tan thereafter.</li>
      <li>I really want a tan when summer time comes without the worry of burning.</li>
      <li>This drives me nuts and takes WAY too much time to deal with.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Overall, I love it and purchased 5 at one go over Amazon since the quality is such a steal for the price.</li>
      <li>Would just rather use normal sunblock.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
      <li>but I figure it may be more due to my skin type because it never hurts and is gone by the next day.</li>
      <li>After that I have made sure to reply and still have a slight redness to my skin in those same places</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried using less, tried using more, no change - white streaks.  </li>
      <li>So think this is something that has developed with age.</li>
      <li>It creates a even tan all around and its a natural tan without all the UV damage.</li>
      <li>Got really burned, didn&#x27;t stay in the sun too long either.  </li>
      <li>Have been using this for years on a daily basis (I live in the tropics)</li>
      <li>I use it as my daily lotion because it works very well if you are prone to dry skin.  </li>
      <li>If you let it dry a bit, you can (again) rub the white areas in hopes that they go away, but who wants to?.  </li>

    <li> Smells great and leaves a nice tan. It&#x27;s working on my sexy skin. I really needed a tan so I&#x27;m happy with the results. As long as I don&#x27;t look like an oompa loompa I&#x27;m good.</li>
    <li> The SPF level is not so great.  Got really burned, didn&#x27;t stay in the sun too long either.  Would just rather use normal sunblock.  Should get a tan either way.</li>
    <li> Wonderful lotion! Not at all greasy or thick. Applies nicely and absorbs into the skin well. Hawaiian Tropic Sun definitely has become my new favorite. Best part, no unpleasant smell. This product is definitely a keeper.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells like piña coladas (awesome perk), plus keeps my skin safe from the sun, without being oily.</li>
    <li> Smells great and is good for those with a base tan or a light-med tan.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t need to say anything but, this IS the one and only product I use or will ever use. I go to Hawaii every year, drive a convertible in California and stay tan without ever peeling.</li>
    <li> As i said it only UVB protection the whole spectrum is UVA/UVB , your still getting great protection but i would still like UVA/UVB more than this which you can find only problem is its More expensive</li>
    <li> I have been using Hawaiian Tropic for as long as I can remember. With age, I have found the importance of proper skin protection. Since in the Winter I become extremely white I really want a tan when summer time comes without the worry of burning. The first day I used this I forgot to reapply and at the end of the day of being at the water park with my kids I had realized that my face, top of ears, and shoulders looked as if they were burnt without the pain. This was my fault but the next day I looked in the mirror and redness was gone and the beginning of a glowing tan was left. After that I have made sure to reply and still have a slight redness to my skin in those same places but I figure it may be more due to my skin type because it never hurts and is gone by the next day. Also never pealed. So think this is something that has developed with age. I love this and would recommend this for anyone trying to avoid sunburns but still looking to get a tan.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! I traveled to Las Vegas and I used this product... It tans well!!! The moisture of my skin was silky smooth!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for many years and like it a lot. at least for my skin type. When a tanning lotion works for you , just don&#x27;t  go for changes</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE Hawaiian Tropic. The tropical scent alone takes me back to sun tanning on the beaches of Hawaii. The lotion is not greasy, it is water resistant and long lasting... I only had to reapply every hour and a half... Love this stuff.. Hawaiian Tropic has always been my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; for sun tanning.</li>
    <li> I like to use this when I go into the tanning booth to keep a solid base color in between bodybuilding contests. I have family/friends who use i in the summer and get solid color as well.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the GOOFY &amp;#34; cap &amp;#34; on the top..............for that reason I switched to Coppertone...............</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I love it! Thanks</li>
    <li> I have been using the product because it is the ONLY SPF 4 that is sold anywhere around me.  It does the job, good to use after you have a base tan - so I give it one star for that.  Otherwise, I thoroughly dislike this lotion.  You constantly get white streaks when applying it.  I don&#x27;t care how much you try to rub it in, more white streaks appear. I&#x27;ve tried using less, tried using more, no change - white streaks.  This drives me nuts and takes WAY too much time to deal with.  I want to put on my lotion and GO!  If you let it dry a bit, you can (again) rub the white areas in hopes that they go away, but who wants to?.  I am ordering another brand with an SPF of 4 from Amazon today.</li>
    <li> Nice, smells nice and not greasy on skin. Leaves a very nice golden tan. Last for a while if you don&#x27;t get wet.</li>
    <li> I have Eczema and Banana Boat&#x27;s Tanning Oil usually aggravated my condition after tanning. I then switched to this one by Hawaiian Tropic and never once did my condition act up again :D    HT&#x27;s Sun Tanning Sunscreen Lotion moisturizes well without the greasiness and offers a noticeable golden tan thereafter. Smells good without being overwhelming. However, I must admit it takes some rubbing before it gets spread out well and absorbed. Overall, I love it and purchased 5 at one go over Amazon since the quality is such a steal for the price. I recommend it! :D</li>
    <li> The product leaves a light sent and do a good job.</li>
    <li> A sunscreen that has no chemical scent is a blessing. Neither does it have the typical coconut scent, so if you are looking for that, skip this one. A nice touch is that the opening is at the bottom so when you go to use it, it is easy to get out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product....it takes me to the beach and summer when I smell it on a cold winters day:)  I would buy it again and love to use it in summer! SPF is only 4 but it worked well at protection even on a hot strong summers day I avoided any burns.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion.  I thought that I might get burnt since the SPF was so low and I&#x27;m fair skinned, but even after spending an hour in the direct sunlight, I didn&#x27;t burn at all.  I just wish it smelled stronger.  If you like light coconut scents, you&#x27;ll enjoy this.  I prefer the original strong Hawaiian Tropic scents.  Regardless of the smell, the product worked great and will help you tan without burning. Plus it&#x27;s a lotion instead of an oil.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have been using it for years.  Do buy this item when you can for the summer season.</li>
    <li> Always like Hawaiian Tropic suntan lotions</li>
    <li> I found this product to be non greasy and absorbs into the skin well, so it can be used daily. It provides effective protection so no burns, peels, or discoloration. It creates a even tan all around and its a natural tan without all the UV damage. Finally it is sweat proof so I can workout without having to worry about it making me greasy if i sweat, or losing my protection. I definitely would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for years on a daily basis (I live in the tropics) and nothing I&#x27;ve tried is more moisturizing and provides more protection for daily use. I don&#x27;t need SPF15+ with all those chemicals. Using this products leads to great-looking, moisturized and tan skin. Put it on in the morning and 10 min. later your tan just beams. I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> I use this sunscreen as my base sunscreen.  I use it as my daily lotion because it works very well if you are prone to dry skin.  I use it on my face too.  The smell is great.  It has one of the better smelling sunscreens.  It is a little expensive to use as daily dry skin lotion but it works very well and it gives me some sunscreen protection.</li>
    <li> I have been buying Hawaiian Tropic since the 1970&#x27;s - it is the best.  Protects, moisturizes and smells the amazing.</li>
    <li> Used this from a friend when we went to the water park in Phoenix, Arizona. I was a little scared of using it in 116 degree weather when it&#x27;s only SPF 4. I applied it once before going out and another time after lunch. We were there for 10 hours and were constantly getting in and out of water. Very happy with the results. I have a nice healthy looking tan and didn&#x27;t burn at all (I usually burn pretty bad). I purchased some for myself and am still pleased. &#x3D; )</li>
    <li> Still my favorite for light coverage and because it&#x27;s a lotion it helps keep your skin from getting too dry.</li>
    <li> Used for years...excellent product!</li>
    <li> Have used Hawaiian Tropic products since 1969, but could only get it in Florida when vacationing at Daytona Beach. Now I can buy it anywhere.</li>
