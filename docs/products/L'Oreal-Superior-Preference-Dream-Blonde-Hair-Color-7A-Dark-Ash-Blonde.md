      <li>Loreal is always best!!!</li>

      <li>I re-order here for best price.</li>
      <li>Worked  great!</li>
      <li>This is the best hair color I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Great product and great price!!!</li>
      <li>Great buy for great product.  </li>
      <li>BUT its a great hair color.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find it in stores, but Amazon&#x27;s price was great.</li>
      <li>That being said it was a great Kit.</li>
      <li>It comes with shampoo, conditioner, leave-in conditioner, along with the hair dye, very nice gloves, and some pre-color conditioner that you apply before you dye your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The result is stunning, with great gray coverage and color perfectly to my taste.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been over 3 weeks now and the color is still bright and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best, most high-quality hair color of its kind.</li>
      <li>But like I said the product was in all good condition, and the expiration date was good.  </li>
      <li>Good luck,</li>
      <li>The volume of the product is adequate for even mid-length hair, the additional products in the box (shampoo, conditioner, and styling lotion) are also wonderful.</li>
      <li>:)) I love it!!</li>
      <li>opened the product, and it had soo many things inside!</li>
      <li>but I just couldn&#x27;t find any colors I liked at the store.</li>
      <li>I advise against this product if you are trying to get rid of warm tones.</li>
      <li>While it did lighten my hair, it was not ash, but a warm tone.</li>
      <li>I really liked this hair color.</li>
      <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;The product was very easy to apply and use.</li>
      <li>Perfect... color is not too dark and great highlights.  </li>
      <li>love how my hair feels...</li>
      <li>Sure beats going to a salon every 8 weeks and paying $100.</li>
      <li>I love</li>
      <li>I love</li>
      <li>and I love the continuous shine cream that is included.</li>
      <li>And out of all the Loreal color products, Dream Blonde is my favorite!!!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>I could not find a better price anywhere.  </li>
      <li>I am sure if you have naturally light brown hair this will take nicely.</li>
      <li>Probably best if you hair is pretty much this color anyway, and you just want to freshen the color and hide some greys.</li>
      <li>However, the product is so good, and gives such great results, that I&#x27;m more than willing to overlook the smell.</li>
      <li>Love the softness and true color.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I decided to test it first!  </li>
      <li>As always my hair turned out wonderfully, but it wasn&#x27;t dark!</li>
      <li>Otherwise the reviews sound good if you are just dyeing if from a natural color.  </li>
      <li>Left my hair in great condition.  </li>
      <li>I wish it was available in the stores.</li>
      <li>It just did not work on my light hair color.</li>
      <li>(although the shipping IS more than the product itself, it should be pretty fast).&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving 3 stars because I guess it was my own fault for not doing more research about pre-bleached hair and trying to dye it an ash blonde.</li>
      <li>Not as easy to use as some  but worth it.  </li>
      <li>I bought two boxes so I could reapply in a week or two, but so far I must say that I really do love this color!</li>
      <li>I followed the directions and my hair looked great wet....</li>
      <li>My hair develops really nice natural highlights if I spend a lot of time out in the sun</li>
      <li>My hair is beautiful, but not even medium to dark.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had my hair bleach blonde a good 15 years.</li>
      <li>Definitely my favorite new beauty purchase!</li>
      <li>Awesome to find my color in dream blonde that they don&#x27;t make anymore at a ridiculously low price.  </li>
      <li>I really liked the long nozzle on the bottle, it made it easy to maneuver over and under my hair.</li>
      <li>Gives my hair a nice, rich blonde color.</li>
      <li>This product produces amazing color and left my hair feeling soft and in better condition than before I used it.</li>
      <li>I wanted to add some definition to it, stop the bleaching, and go for a more natural blond color.</li>
      <li>and I am rarely disappointed.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Most recently, I have been a loyal fan of Perfect 10; however, with limited availability I switched to try the Dream Blonde by L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
      <li>I bought the Dark Ash Blonde, 7A, and color is great for me!</li>
      <li>After a few weeks when it lightens it just get better and better.  </li>
      <li>Shipping very fast; would recommend this store to anyone.</li>
      <li>This is my first 1 star review in my 10 years on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Love the Loreal Dream Blonde Hair Color.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s a real pain to not get what you order!</li>
      <li>So, why should I have to pay to return something that is not what was listed in the first place?  </li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t think that it really mattered, but my hair was pre-bleached before using this product.</li>
      <li>REALLY?  </li>
      <li>My hair has this luminescence that makes it a shiny, shimmery blonde when it catches the light.</li>
      <li>But just looking straight at me, you would say that my hair is brown.</li>
      <li>It was really offensive to me, an odd aroma, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll go away after the first washing, plus mousse and hairspray masked it well afterward.  </li>
      <li>It is maybe a shade or two darker than my normal light blonde.</li>
      <li>I loved this shade of Dark Ash Blonde 7A, also called \\&quot;Lily Blossom\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I loved this shade of Dark Ash Blonde 7A, also called \\&quot;Lily Blossom\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>Wonderful product, definitely upped the game in hair color!</li>
      <li>like I did in high school.</li>
      <li>have naturally medium-light brown hair, blue eyes, dark brows, and a light skin tone that tans easily.</li>
      <li>Very natural.</li>
      <li>It also left my hair in better condition than any other hair color I&#x27;ve ever used - soft, shiny, and silky.  </li>
      <li>I want to emphasize that it is very natural looking, so if you&#x27;re looking for something that will make you really and truly blonde go</li>
      <li>The Product itself was pretty much like all the other hair color results, out of the box color.</li>
      <li>Then I purchased this a second time, thinking the color would turn out a little better.  </li>
      <li>here&#x27;s where my unexpected surprise comes in....</li>
      <li>I recommend this product completely.  </li>
      <li>box includes a shampoo and conditioner treatments, which help keep your color shiny and your hair soft.</li>
      <li>It produced a dark ash blonde a tiny bit lighter than the other L&#x27;Oreal product I used (which is fine with me), but I belive it looked a little lighter only because of all the great highlights it added.</li>
      <li>I have been looking for it in stores because I love the extras that come with the dream blonde that don&#x27;t come with other L&#x27;Oreal Color, like the extra conditioner and shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I usually dye my hair very light shades of blonde, but this time wanted to darken it to my natural shade to try and match my roots (and maybe not color my hair anymore).</li>
      <li>Perhaps my starting shade was too light to go this dark?</li>
      <li>I dyed it, my hair was a straight up medium brown from my last attempt at going back to having a natural look.</li>
      <li>I have also used the Medium Blonde, but thought it was just a little too light for me.</li>
      <li>I ordered this and received the regular Loreal Superior Preference 7A Dark Ash Blonde that you can purchase from any store for way less!  </li>
      <li>I still had red in my hair from the last time I dyed it but the color almost completely covered it up!!</li>
      <li>I was looking on amazon for a blonde hair dye that looked natural, but that had some definition to it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been chasing that natural highlight look for the last 10 years and this is the closest I&#x27;ve come so far.&lt;br /&gt;Before</li>
      <li>Along with the normal color and conditioner, the &amp;#34;Dream Blonde 7A&amp;#34; box comes with additional items such as shampoo, a tube of oil that you put on hair prior to coloring and an after treatment tube to keep hair shiny.  </li>
      <li>It had shampoo and conditioner full size tubes, and a deeper conditioner in a smaller tube, but you use very little.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The instruction are clear, in English and Spanish.</li>
      <li>I ordered 2 because my real color is dark brown..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the softness and true color.  Not as easy to use as some  but worth it.  I re-order here for best price.</li>
    <li> Perfect... color is not too dark and great highlights.  After a few weeks when it lightens it just get better and better.  Very natural. I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
    <li> Gives my hair a nice, rich blonde color.</li>
    <li> This dye was not the color I was hoping for. While it did lighten my hair, it was not ash, but a warm tone. I advise against this product if you are trying to get rid of warm tones. I can see why the product was discontinued.</li>
    <li> REALLY?  I HAVE TO LEAVE A STAR??  DO NOT ORDER FROM OTCRX4U!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not receive the &amp;#34;Dream Blonde&amp;#34; product that is listed!  I ordered this and received the regular Loreal Superior Preference 7A Dark Ash Blonde that you can purchase from any store for way less!  Along with the normal color and conditioner, the &amp;#34;Dream Blonde 7A&amp;#34; box comes with additional items such as shampoo, a tube of oil that you put on hair prior to coloring and an after treatment tube to keep hair shiny.  I HAVE purchased this product before and received the CORRECT item but it was from a different seller!  So, be careful when ordering and I ADVISE AGAINST ORDERING FROM OTCRX4U!  They are charging over $10 plus shipping for this item and then sending the regular 7A Dark Ash Blonde that you can purchase in any store for way less!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller said I could return the product but there would be a 15% processing fee plus shipping!  Plus they don&#x27;t have this &amp;#34;Dream Blonde&amp;#34; product to exchange it for!  Ya know, the one that&#x27;s listed!!!!!!!  I felt they should have refunded the total cost since THEY are advertising the wrong product!  False listing!!  So, why should I have to pay to return something that is not what was listed in the first place?  I thought I was getting what is listed!!  And it&#x27;s a real pain to not get what you order!</li>
    <li> I loved this shade of Dark Ash Blonde 7A, also called \\&quot;Lily Blossom\\&quot;. It is not near as dark as other dark ash blondes, very true to the color shown on the box, NO BRASSY, over processed look! Also it comes with a generous amount of formula to do longer hair. Comes with shampoo and conditioner and also small tube of leave in conditioner. I love it!(And I have been dying my hair for a LONG time!!!) Loreal is always best!!!</li>
    <li> The Product itself was pretty much like all the other hair color results, out of the box color. That being said it was a great Kit. It had shampoo and conditioner full size tubes, and a deeper conditioner in a smaller tube, but you use very little. Over all for the price I thought this kit was great!! The boxes  they came in were in rather poor condition like the they had been crushed . But like I said the product was in all good condition, and the expiration date was good.  Worked  great!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair color I&#x27;ve ever used. There are no red tones like other hair color I&#x27;ve used and I love the continuous shine cream that is included. I wish it was available in the stores.</li>
    <li> I was looking on amazon for a blonde hair dye that looked natural, but that had some definition to it. I saw this color, and after reading some reviews, I thought, \\&quot;Oh my gosh I must get this!!\\&quot; The shipping was excellent (although the shipping IS more than the product itself, it should be pretty fast).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened the product, and it had soo many things inside! It comes with shampoo, conditioner, leave-in conditioner, along with the hair dye, very nice gloves, and some pre-color conditioner that you apply before you dye your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now here&#x27;s where my unexpected surprise comes in....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think that it really mattered, but my hair was pre-bleached before using this product. I looked everywhere on the box, and there was nothing about pre-bleached hair anywhere on the box... And on the color chart, the lightest color to get the color on the box was almost bleach-like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I guess it&#x27;s called \\&quot;Ash Blonde\\&quot; for a reason... My hair turned GREY. Not a blonde with grey undertone... No. It turned GREY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really disappointed with the results, and I&#x27;m having photos taken in a few days. Now I will forever have my yearbook photo of me with grey hair....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;m giving 3 stars because I guess it was my own fault for not doing more research about pre-bleached hair and trying to dye it an ash blonde. I guess I&#x27;ve learned my lesson.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of home color products. Most recently, I have been a loyal fan of Perfect 10; however, with limited availability I switched to try the Dream Blonde by L&#x27;Oreal. Wonderful product, definitely upped the game in hair color! The volume of the product is adequate for even mid-length hair, the additional products in the box (shampoo, conditioner, and styling lotion) are also wonderful. Definitely my favorite new beauty purchase!</li>
    <li> Yep, my hair went red again, that is just me and my hair....I have to accept that red will always come out in my hair.  Left my hair in great condition.  My mistake, my hair will never be an ash shade.  Probably best if you hair is pretty much this color anyway, and you just want to freshen the color and hide some greys.</li>
    <li> I loved this shade of Dark Ash Blonde 7A, also called \\&quot;Lily Blossom\\&quot;. It is not near as dark as other dark ash blondes, very true to the color shown on the box, NO BRASSY, over processed look! Also it comes with a generous amount of formula to do longer hair.

    <li> This product produces amazing color and left my hair feeling soft and in better condition than before I used it. My natural hair color is a dark ash blonde, but I have a lot of grey and my hair was stripped of color due to perming.  It was also very dry. I was using another L&#x27;Oreal hair color, but I wanted to give this a try and I&#x27;ll be using this one from now on.  It produced a dark ash blonde a tiny bit lighter than the other L&#x27;Oreal product I used (which is fine with me), but I belive it looked a little lighter only because of all the great highlights it added. It also left my hair in better condition than any other hair color I&#x27;ve ever used - soft, shiny, and silky.  The ash color also prevents any red undertones from developing (always use ash if you want to avoid red highlights). The only negative thing I have to say about it is the smell when you wash it out (not while it&#x27;s on your head).  It was really offensive to me, an odd aroma, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll go away after the first washing, plus mousse and hairspray masked it well afterward.  Maybe it was just me too - other people may not be bothered by it. However, the product is so good, and gives such great results, that I&#x27;m more than willing to overlook the smell.</li>
    <li> Great buy for great product.  I recommend this product completely.  I could not find a better price anywhere.  Sure beats going to a salon every 8 weeks and paying $100.</li>
    <li> I always use L&#x27;Oreal products when it comes to coloring my hair and I am rarely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;The instruction are clear, in English and Spanish. The result is stunning, with great gray coverage and color perfectly to my taste. It&#x27;s been over 3 weeks now and the color is still bright and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;The box includes a shampoo and conditioner treatments, which help keep your color shiny and your hair soft.</li>
    <li> It came really late..BUT its a great hair color. .I love how my hair feels... I ordered 2 because my real color is dark brown..I just try it things morning. .:)) I love it!!</li>
    <li> Not sure why I bought hair dye off the internet but I just couldn&#x27;t find any colors I liked at the store. I still had red in my hair from the last time I dyed it but the color almost completely covered it up!! I bought two boxes so I could reapply in a week or two, but so far I must say that I really do love this color!</li>
    <li> Love the Loreal Dream Blonde Hair Color. I bought the Dark Ash Blonde, 7A, and color is great for me! I have also used the Medium Blonde, but thought it was just a little too light for me. The box also includes shampoo, conditioner, and a leave-in conditioner. Great product and great price!!! I can&#x27;t find it in stores, but Amazon&#x27;s price was great. Can&#x27;t go wrong! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other brands, and always come back to Loreal. And out of all the Loreal color products, Dream Blonde is my favorite!!!!!!!!!! See what you think!</li>
    <li> This is my first 1 star review in my 10 years on Amazon. I am a long time Amazon buyer and also know a thing or two about hair. I&#x27;ve had my hair bleach blonde a good 15 years. I wanted to add some definition to it, stop the bleaching, and go for a more natural blond color. I followed the directions and my hair looked great wet....until I dried it. The crown was blonde/brown and the rest turned purplish gray. I looked like a cartoon character. It just did not work on my light hair color. I ended up coloring it medium brown and will put in highlights. I give one star, because it did not give me the desired result, and maybe will alert others who have bleached hair not to use this product. I am sure if you have naturally light brown hair this will take nicely. I should have listened to the other reviewers with bleach blonde hair.</li>
    <li> Awesome to find my color in dream blonde that they don&#x27;t make anymore at a ridiculously low price.  I have been looking for it in stores because I love the extras that come with the dream blonde that don&#x27;t come with other L&#x27;Oreal Color, like the extra conditioner and shampoo.  Shipping very fast; would recommend this store to anyone.</li>
    <li> I purchased this twice.  The first time I had bleached and toned my hair and then used L&#x27;Oreal 7A Dark Ash Blonde, my hair was a little grey underneath because the bleach was applied at my neck first, but nothing big.  Then I purchased this a second time, thinking the color would turn out a little better.  Before I started, I decided to test this on a small piece of my hair, because I read a review that said her hair tuned gray.  So I snipped a piece off in the back and tested it.  And it turned gray!!  I&#x27;m so glad I decided to test it first!  So bleaching your hair and then using this color is apparently not a good idea.  Otherwise the reviews sound good if you are just dyeing if from a natural color.  Good luck, but this didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I really liked this hair color. I want to emphasize that it is very natural looking, so if you&#x27;re looking for something that will make you really and truly blonde go elsewhere!&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally medium-light brown hair, blue eyes, dark brows, and a light skin tone that tans easily. My hair develops really nice natural highlights if I spend a lot of time out in the sun like I did in high school. I&#x27;ve been chasing that natural highlight look for the last 10 years and this is the closest I&#x27;ve come so far.&lt;br /&gt;Before I dyed it, my hair was a straight up medium brown from my last attempt at going back to having a natural look. My hair is now a slightly lighter brown but the difference is in the highlights! My hair has this luminescence that makes it a shiny, shimmery blonde when it catches the light. But just looking straight at me, you would say that my hair is brown. So don&#x27;t expect sunny blonde cascades of hair when you use this product.&lt;br /&gt;The product was very easy to apply and use. I really liked the long nozzle on the bottle, it made it easy to maneuver over and under my hair.</li>
    <li> As always, Dream Blonde delivers salon color at home. It&#x27;s the best, most high-quality hair color of its kind. That being said, 7A Dark Ash Blonde didn&#x27;t fully meet my expectations. I usually dye my hair very light shades of blonde, but this time wanted to darken it to my natural shade to try and match my roots (and maybe not color my hair anymore). As always my hair turned out wonderfully, but it wasn&#x27;t dark! It is maybe a shade or two darker than my normal light blonde. It&#x27;s still a lighter shade of blonde, not even medium. My hair is beautiful, but not even medium to dark. So that was disappointing... but at least my hair looks great. Perhaps my starting shade was too light to go this dark?</li>
