### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Pinks, oranges and purples look awesome!  </li>
      <li>but they are beautiful!</li>
      <li>this is a great piece to add to your makeup collection!</li>
      <li>Must use a primer to achieve the best results!  </li>
      <li>I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCT!</li>
      <li>Colors were great</li>
      <li>I saw the bright colors of these lipsticks and they grabbed my attention.</li>
      <li>Good to use during Halloween or when you just want to mix things up.</li>
      <li>Angelina is absolutely gorgeous.</li>
      <li>and they just aren&#x27;t good</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
      <li>Nice colors.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s delightful to have new options!</li>
      <li>I love most of the colors!</li>
      <li>nice color but way too light</li>
      <li>Oh and the have cute names, like the darkest shade of purple out of the twelve</li>
      <li>, some of the colors are better than others.</li>
      <li>Very cool, daughter loves them.</li>
      <li>But the other eight colours are beautiful!</li>
      <li>The colors are bright and vibrant.  </li>
      <li>I really like these because they are so bright and unique</li>
      <li>I have been prancing around with bright pastel lips in a new color every day this spring.</li>
      <li>these colors are so smooth.. not sticky</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re great for the price and honestly, everybody gives me compliments - nobody notices the small downsides.  </li>
      <li>Super pigmented, very rich and moisturizing, matte, and very nice on me (dark hair, light eyes, light olive tone skin).</li>
      <li>(also, the tubes don&#x27;t look like the ones in the picture - but the colors are pretty accurate)</li>
      <li>The texture of them are pretty smooth, yet can be blotchy.</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping!  </li>
      <li>All and all its worth the price.</li>
      <li>These lipsticks are really fun to play with and wear out.  </li>
      <li>This is very much a budget lipstick.</li>
      <li>I have a feeling that the contents of the bundle vary from person to person, since I didn&#x27;t get the exact colors listed.</li>
      <li>the bright colors a few times which is understandable.</li>
      <li>FOR THIS PRICE YOU REALLY CANT BEAT IT!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to give the other four lipticks to friends who have more medium/darker skin and cooler skin tones - they&#x27;re fighting over them!</li>
      <li>they were more deep in each colot</li>
      <li>the pinks are lovely the other colors you have to apply a billion layers to get full color.</li>
      <li>I can still use them,but nothing is as good as new when most of them are broken.</li>
      <li>I suggest you apply to warm lips, or wait a while after you apply them for them to break down a bit.</li>
      <li>The blues and greens not so much.</li>
      <li>They go on smoothly but are not wear proof and need to be reapplied after only an hour.  </li>
      <li>They work really well for me</li>
      <li>had the lipstick not broken.</li>
      <li>So, even if you only like a few colors it is still a pretty good deal.&lt;br</li>
      <li>pretty frequent reapplication&lt;</li>
      <li>many very similar pinks in my bundle (see last picture especially)&lt;br</li>
      <li>Out of the 12 colours, there are 4 (yellow, lime, light orange and baby blue) that don&#x27;t suit my skin tone.</li>
      <li>Little freaky outside the box, be different and bright for Spring.&lt;br /&gt;Many</li>
      <li>/&gt;-A few kicky fun colors: orange!</li>
      <li>The white base allowed for a beautiful color pay off and allowd these babies to rise to there full potential.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re worth the price - I&#x27;d reccomend them versus a few others I considered purchasing.  </li>
      <li>I also applied a tiny bit of my NYX white eyeshadow primer or you can use the milk pencil from NYX , and apply just enough not to much, over the entire lip.</li>

    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Lots of wearable purples, corals, and pinks&lt;br /&gt;-A few kicky fun colors: orange! blue! green! The coverage was less&lt;br /&gt;-Decent coverage with a few applications&lt;br /&gt;-Cute, cartoonish packaging&lt;br /&gt;-LOTS OF LIPSTICK! SO CHEAP!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-packaging is glued together and cracks/falls apart easily&lt;br /&gt;-requires pretty frequent reapplication&lt;br /&gt;-smell like artificial grape flavoring&lt;br /&gt;-too many very similar pinks in my bundle (see last picture especially)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swatched all the colors in the photos below. I have a feeling that the contents of the bundle vary from person to person, since I didn&#x27;t get the exact colors listed. Don&#x27;t buy this if you have your heart on one of the shown colors because you might not get it. Also don&#x27;t buy this if you are looking for something that stays on all day. This is very much a budget lipstick. That said- I have been prancing around with bright pastel lips in a new color every day this spring. They work really well for me and it&#x27;s delightful to have new options!</li>
    <li> Some came in broken or smeared across the lids but it works relatively well For cheap lipstick</li>
    <li> very bad .. worth money</li>
    <li> Out of the 12 colours, there are 4 (yellow, lime, light orange and baby blue) that don&#x27;t suit my skin tone. But the other eight colours are beautiful! Super pigmented, very rich and moisturizing, matte, and very nice on me (dark hair, light eyes, light olive tone skin). I get a lot of compliments on them. I&#x27;m very pleased. I&#x27;m going to give the other four lipticks to friends who have more medium/darker skin and cooler skin tones - they&#x27;re fighting over them!</li>
    <li> with some of the color you have to try because it all depend on skin color and hair color... I give it a 4 star...</li>
    <li> Very cool, daughter loves them.</li>
    <li> FOR THIS PRICE YOU REALLY CANT BEAT IT! these colors are so smooth.. not sticky what so ever.. you might have to double layer the bright colors a few times which is understandable. I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCT! AND IT SMELLS JUST LIKE FRUITY PEBBLES!!! you will not be disappointed. this is a great piece to add to your makeup collection!</li>
    <li> These lipsticks are really fun to play with and wear out.  As people have said, they&#x27;re not very solid and they show all the cracks on one&#x27;s lips.  However, lip treatments and color bases can fix that.  The pinks are easier to work with without a base, and the others I put some white eyeliner on my lips first.  They&#x27;re great for the price and honestly, everybody gives me compliments - nobody notices the small downsides.  They&#x27;re worth the price - I&#x27;d reccomend them versus a few others I considered purchasing.  (also, the tubes don&#x27;t look like the ones in the picture - but the colors are pretty accurate)</li>
    <li> What you see is what you get.</li>
    <li> Little bit chalky.Nice colors.For good result need lip base.</li>
    <li> nice color but way too light</li>
    <li> Not very good quality at all, some of the colors are better than others. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I saw the bright colors of these lipsticks and they grabbed my attention. I got them and tried all of the on. The texture of them are pretty smooth, yet can be blotchy. I suggest you apply to warm lips, or wait a while after you apply them for them to break down a bit. Apply a little lip balm, one that is not to greasy but just enough to moisturize your lips. I also applied a tiny bit of my NYX white eyeshadow primer or you can use the milk pencil from NYX , and apply just enough not to much, over the entire lip. The white base allowed for a beautiful color pay off and allowd these babies to rise to there full potential. Although they needed a little help, I still think that they were a gret by. Oh and the have cute names, like the darkest shade of purple out of the twelve Angelina is absolutely gorgeous. Try them out, you get twelve lipsticks for what you would pay for one.</li>
    <li> The colors are bright and vibrant.  They go on smoothly but are not wear proof and need to be reapplied after only an hour.  All lipsticks came unbroken and in the colors advertised.</li>
    <li> I love most of the colors! Little freaky outside the box, be different and bright for Spring.&lt;br /&gt;Many of them were broken off at the bottom, disappointing because they are sealed and new. I can still use them,but nothing is as good as new when most of them are broken. That aside, you can&#x27;t beat the price!! So, even if you only like a few colors it is still a pretty good deal.&lt;br /&gt; Could also use for face paint at Halloween.</li>
    <li> the pinks are lovely the other colors you have to apply a billion layers to get full color.</li>
    <li> Colors were great&lt;br /&gt;Wish they were more deep in each colot</li>
    <li> Pinks, oranges and purples look awesome!  The blues and greens not so much. But what do you expect for such a low price? Very fast shipping!  But one of the lipsticks was open and broken, making a mess in the package.  All and all its worth the price. Good to use during Halloween or when you just want to mix things up. The smell isn&#x27;t completely unpleasant,  except the lavender, that one smells like baby powder.  Must use a primer to achieve the best results!  Would have been 4 stars had the lipstick not broken.</li>
    <li> i got somethig completely different. it was lip pencils instead of lipsticks</li>
    <li> I really like these because they are so bright and unique but u need a primer because they will not stay on without it but they are beautiful!</li>
    <li> This product took around 2-3 months to deliver and they broke almost immeadieatly and they are not very vibrant I just don&#x27;t recommend I personally think they settle in the creases in your lips and they just aren&#x27;t good</li>
