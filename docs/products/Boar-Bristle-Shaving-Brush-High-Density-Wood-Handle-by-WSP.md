      <li>and it does a great job.</li>
      <li>would be great.</li>
      <li>It does a good job of lifting the hairs on my face  </li>
      <li>Makes a good lather if you don&#x27;t shake all the water out after soaking it.</li>
      <li>One good thing is I have not lost any bristle from this brush.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was shipped within a couple days and my father is very pleased with the brush</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just not the most comfortable, attractive or easiest to use.</li>
      <li>Good quality, great for sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>I would recommend this brush for sure, but I&#x27;m still looking for the holy grail of brushes. . .</li>
      <li>I have a WSP badger that I love</li>
      <li>I have several brushes, and I think this is the best one for soap.</li>
      <li>Tres elegant.  </li>
      <li>Good quality and fast shipping</li>
      <li>/&gt;In use, it feels good on the face but doesn&#x27;t lather particularly well.</li>
      <li>Seems to be pretty nice quality.</li>
      <li>Boars are my favorites and I was hoping this from a new company would be good.  </li>
      <li>This would be a great brush at any price but for ten dollars it is tremendous.</li>
      <li>this was hubbys first shaving brush I think he likes the one from art of shaving better</li>
      <li>Amazon gave me a full refund and a free overnight shipping coupon.</li>
      <li>but he enjoyed this for a first time one</li>
      <li>For those looking to get into wet shaving, this is a great starter brush.</li>
      <li>My WSP boar came nicely packaged in a classy box and wrapped in tissue paper.  </li>
      <li>it was cheap and worth a gamble, but I can&#x27;t recommend it even at that price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You have to be more energetic to get soap to lather properly and this brush holds up better than the higher quality but softer badger brush.</li>
      <li>The smell is not bad at all for a boar brush.</li>
      <li>For the price that&#x27;s not bad.</li>
      <li>After a week of use (with adequate drying time)</li>
      <li>I like a brush that is a little stiffer, great brush</li>
      <li>It loads quickly and easily holds enough lather for two passes and touch ups.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know where they get the  high density from, my old brush has more bristles...</li>
      <li>Works up a great lather with hard soaps and works equally as well with the most luxurious creams.</li>
      <li>I conditioned it and kept it in hot water and shampoo.</li>
      <li>This is the first shave brush we&#x27;ve used</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t be sucked in like I was and think that bigger bucks &#x3D; better product.</li>
      <li>Even at the low price point, there are better options - hopefully newer versions will be improved.</li>
      <li>will give this item a 5 star for doing exactly what it says.</li>
      <li>If you are new to wet shaving the is a good starter brush to teach you brush care.</li>
      <li>Good stiff brush.</li>
      <li>Though several family members had tried to purchase one from a store I decided to check online and came across this particular item at such a great price compared to so many others whose prices were extremely high.&lt;br</li>
      <li>On the flipside, the handle is well coated and the brush certainly lathers... and well.</li>
      <li>And it does come ready to use, no break in required.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this brush.</li>
      <li>but we really like it.</li>
      <li>Not so much with this one.</li>
      <li>but the hotter the water the more it smells like a wet animal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and I have other boar brushes that I love as well</li>
      <li>The clear coat on the handle is clacking off and the brush has a twist tin the not that makes the bristles turn funny.</li>
      <li>I bought this to have a soft large brush for cleaning my guns and this meets the need very well.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>usual hair loss for the first week or so of use, but it has broken in nicely and the tips are split and nice and soft.</li>
      <li>Also, the hair seems to be significantly taller in the center - disproportionate to the hairs on the edges.</li>
      <li>I was really surprised at the quality for the price.</li>
      <li>Everything is fine with this brush but when wet it actually smells like a wet</li>
      <li>Sadly, the brush wasn&#x27;t as nice as the box in which it was delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My 80 some year old father had been asking for a shaving brush for several months since the one he had owned for many decades had broken.  </li>
      <li>Not too stiff and so far have not lost any bristles after the first shave.</li>
      <li>The brushes are a little stiff which makes it hard to get a good lather on your face, but they are a lot softer and nicer on the face than the badger brushes I have had.  </li>

<li> This will help you see if you like soft or a stiff brush.</li>
<li> It was true that it had very little smell, but that was the only thing that could be said about it being mostly broken in.  </li>
<li> Can&#x27;t lather small areas such as upper lip.  </li>
<li> It gets softer after multiple uses so the bristles won&#x27;t be harsh after like 10 shaves.</li>
<li> Thing stunk like wet dog.</li>
<li> and I would suggest to others that they purchase the from Wet Shaving Products as well</li>
<li> It&#x27;s so stiff in the middle that putting on lather is like sticking your face with a screwdriver.  </li>
<li> This brush will last a year no more.</li>
<li> This is not a very good brush ,very low quality bristles.</li>
<li> Whether that&#x27;s a result of the gluing, I&#x27;m not sure of, but the result is an odd brush to use.</li>
<li> Others have written that the brush is stiff -</li>
<li> Unfortunately it is worse than the starter brushes that you find in drugstores.  </li>
<li> it still doesn&#x27;t look anything like the brush with \\&quot;broken in\\&quot; bristles shown in the pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The \\&quot;broken in\\&quot; bristles were barely broken in, but I figured I&#x27;d give it a week or two to see how it would evolve.  </li>
<li> I waited to write a review until it was used at least 20 times but unfortunately, it hasn&#x27;t improved.</li>
<li> I should have returned the brush for a refund as soon as I saw it, but unfortunately I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I really wanted to like this brush. I have a WSP badger that I love and I have other boar brushes that I love as well so I figured WSP+Boar would be great. Not so much with this one. Others have written that the brush is stiff - I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the hair, I think it&#x27;s the glue holding together the knot. The glue bulges into the brush, prohibiting the hair from moving like you would expect it to. Also, the hair seems to be significantly taller in the center - disproportionate to the hairs on the edges. Whether that&#x27;s a result of the gluing, I&#x27;m not sure of, but the result is an odd brush to use. On the flipside, the handle is well coated and the brush certainly lathers... and well. It&#x27;s just not the most comfortable, attractive or easiest to use. Even at the low price point, there are better options - hopefully newer versions will be improved.</li>
    <li> My WSP boar came nicely packaged in a classy box and wrapped in tissue paper.  Tres elegant.  Sadly, the brush wasn&#x27;t as nice as the box in which it was delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a feeling I should have returned the brush for a refund as soon as I saw it, but unfortunately I didn&#x27;t.  The \\&quot;broken in\\&quot; bristles were barely broken in, but I figured I&#x27;d give it a week or two to see how it would evolve.  After using it once, I gave up hope.  The bristles swirl around like a big ol&#x27; cowlick, and seem to lack density in the center.  After a week of use (with adequate drying time) it still doesn&#x27;t look anything like the brush with \\&quot;broken in\\&quot; bristles shown in the pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In use, it feels good on the face but doesn&#x27;t lather particularly well. My similarly priced Escali badger blows the WSP boar away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At ten bucks it was cheap and worth a gamble, but I can&#x27;t recommend it even at that price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen reviews and the brush looks like the ones in the ad, but mine doesn&#x27;t come close.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Good quality and fast shipping</li>
    <li> This is not a very good brush ,very low quality bristles. I thought about sending it back. but I don&#x27;t think it will last long anyway.</li>
    <li> Too bushy.  Can&#x27;t lather small areas such as upper lip.  You get what you pay for--next time i will pay closer attention to ratings and comments.</li>
    <li> I like the brush, I&#x27;m a fan of boar&#x27;s hair vs. badger brushes.  The brushes are a little stiff which makes it hard to get a good lather on your face, but they are a lot softer and nicer on the face than the badger brushes I have had.  I would recommend this brush for sure, but I&#x27;m still looking for the holy grail of brushes. . .</li>
    <li> I bought this to have a soft large brush for cleaning my guns and this meets the need very well.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know where they get the  high density from, my old brush has more bristles... Maybe they are referring to how dense the packing is so it is smaller in size....</li>
    <li> Thing stunk like wet dog. Still does. I conditioned it and kept it in hot water and shampoo. Then rinsed it out. It does a good job of lifting the hairs on my face  but I just use it for  pre shave. My suggestion is to get a badger brush if you can afford it. If not then wash this multiple times before it even comes close to your face. One good thing is I have not lost any bristle from this brush. So yeah.</li>
    <li> This would be a great brush at any price but for ten dollars it is tremendous. I have several brushes, and I think this is the best one for soap. It loads quickly and easily holds enough lather for two passes and touch ups. I&#x27;ve used it for creams also and it does a great job. And it does come ready to use, no break in required. I was really surprised at the quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Everything is fine with this brush but when wet it actually smells like a wet hog.&lt;br /&gt;I have soaked it but the hotter the water the more it smells like a wet animal.&lt;br /&gt;I will give this item a 5 star for doing exactly what it says.</li>
    <li> this was hubbys first shaving brush I think he likes the one from art of shaving better but he enjoyed this for a first time one</li>
    <li> My 80 some year old father had been asking for a shaving brush for several months since the one he had owned for many decades had broken.  Though several family members had tried to purchase one from a store I decided to check online and came across this particular item at such a great price compared to so many others whose prices were extremely high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was shipped within a couple days and my father is very pleased with the brush and I would suggest to others that they purchase the from Wet Shaving Products as well</li>
    <li> Not the best but good for the price. I have used the brush for several months and it still sheds. The smell is not bad at all for a boar brush. Good stiff brush. This brush will last a year no more. For the price that&#x27;s not bad. The clear coat on the handle is clacking off and the brush has a twist tin the not that makes the bristles turn funny. Makes a good lather if you don&#x27;t shake all the water out after soaking it. If you are new to wet shaving the is a good starter brush to teach you brush care. This will help you see if you like soft or a stiff brush.</li>
    <li> I like a brush that is a little stiffer, great brush</li>
    <li> It gets softer after multiple uses so the bristles won&#x27;t be harsh after like 10 shaves. Foams up well and makes hair stand up so it&#x27;s a closer shave. This is the first shave brush we&#x27;ve used but we really like it.</li>
    <li> Boars are my favorites and I was hoping this from a new company would be good.  Unfortunately it is worse than the starter brushes that you find in drugstores.  It was true that it had very little smell, but that was the only thing that could be said about it being mostly broken in.  It&#x27;s so stiff in the middle that putting on lather is like sticking your face with a screwdriver.  I waited to write a review until it was used at least 20 times but unfortunately, it hasn&#x27;t improved. One star might be generous.</li>
    <li> For those looking to get into wet shaving, this is a great starter brush. Don&#x27;t be sucked in like I was and think that bigger bucks &#x3D; better product. I have a $200 silvertip that sits in my shave den collecting dust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, like all WSP products, is well constructed. usual hair loss for the first week or so of use, but it has broken in nicely and the tips are split and nice and soft. Works up a great lather with hard soaps and works equally as well with the most luxurious creams. This will be a permanent fixture in my rotation.</li>
    <li> Lathers well. Seems to be pretty nice quality.</li>
    <li> Good quality, great for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> The bristles that are glued into the wood handle came out after about two weeks. I tried gluing them back in, but that did not work. Amazon gave me a full refund and a free overnight shipping coupon.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with shaving soap instead of cream. You have to be more energetic to get soap to lather properly and this brush holds up better than the higher quality but softer badger brush.</li>
    <li> Well made but pricey.</li>
    <li> Works well with the Arko soap that I purchased. Not too stiff and so far have not lost any bristles after the first shave. Highly recommend.</li>
