### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>VERY GOOD!</li>
      <li>That way I should get the best of both.</li>
      <li>My honey is happy with this.  </li>
      <li>It was great for sloughing off when I cleansed my face.</li>
      <li>Nature&#x27;s own way!</li>
      <li>and I have to say my face looks really good.  </li>
      <li>This product provides the perfect amount of glycolic acid for a daily/weekly product, and I truly think even after a couple weeks my skin looks fresh, hydrated, and rested.  </li>
      <li>According to Beautypedia, this was given a BEST rating, has a very high percentage of AHA, and has the correct pH for it to work as a chemical exfoliant.</li>
      <li>Absolutely amazing product</li>
      <li>I keep hearing things like &amp;#34;firmer&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;clearer&amp;#34; although I honestly haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.  </li>
      <li>It feels ok on my skin, but after using it I had an increase in breakouts which isn&#x27;t that surprising</li>
      <li>It’s just kind of slimy.  </li>
      <li>I already have nice skin</li>
      <li>I liked this as did my wife.</li>
      <li>What I really liked was the way it felt on my face.</li>
      <li>You will do better with a good mask regimen.  </li>
      <li>Happy that the formula was not irritating to my skin - scent is light and pleasant.</li>
      <li>It is really easy to use and does a nice job of restoring your skins brightness and youthful appearance.</li>
      <li>product goes on easily, although it is kind of gooey.</li>
      <li>My winter skin is snapping into noticeably better, softer shape from using the Olay line.  </li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>I do love the bottle and design of the pump.</li>
      <li>I had to recheck the packaging to make sure it was a micro-peel and not just some moisturizing treatment.</li>
      <li>The more I used it the more</li>
      <li>but I got better results from bi-weekly micro peel products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really love this glycolic acid treatment.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s because this product does more than moisturize.</li>
      <li>Perhaps after using it for a longer period of time I will begin to notice a greater change.&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, for the money, I wanted to see more results.</li>
      <li>This tends to keep my skin healthy, toned, and moisturized.</li>
      <li>Olay has always been a favorite for me, and as I get older, I find their products to be some of the best because they do the job, and they&#x27;re gentle too.</li>
      <li>Since I think this is a product that requires more time to evaluate, I&#x27;m rating it 4 stars now for the noted improvement, and will adjust after two or three weeks with a more detailed review.</li>
      <li>For those who are looking for a way to clear their skin that is safe, gentle and feels really good, this is a great</li>
      <li>Love the Olay product line, so I was excited to try out this anti aging night serum.  </li>
      <li>The product feels a bit like egg whites when it goes on, but it dries very quickly.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply.</li>
      <li>so was concerned this may be too strong.</li>
      <li>I did not see any of my fine lines get lighter or disappear.</li>
      <li>With that context, I&#x27;ve had no issues with using the Olay formula, to me it feels gentle and effective in a light way.</li>
      <li>Fantastic bargain compared to $200+ facials.</li>
      <li>A good simple, fragrance free lotion will do much better.</li>
      <li>The glycerin does a good job of moisturizing the skin and my face was not red from using this as with more aggressive peels.</li>
      <li>I could feel a very fine and minute peel the first day, but after than nothing.  </li>
      <li>my advise - use VERY sparingly!!!  </li>
      <li>I liked this particularly because it wasn&#x27;t as aggressive on my skin as I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>My grandmother used Olay face cream for as long as I can remember, and she looked great until the day she passed away at the age of 91.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited to see continued improvement over time.</li>
      <li>Already a fan of the Olay products, my sweetie was excited to try this.  </li>
      <li>that exactly on the 5th day I felt my face looked better when I looked in the mirror.  </li>
      <li>It easily absorbs into my skin (I haven&#x27;t had the slimy/greasy experience that other reviewers have experienced), and hasn&#x27;t caused any burning or itchiness.</li>
      <li>But everyone’s experience will vary based on their own skin type and, as I said, my skin is very sensitive to this type of thing.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels nice, soft and clean.  </li>
      <li>I have used Retin A on my face for decades and am delighted with the results, but I neglected to use it on my upper chest area, so it looks sun damaged (I&#x27;m 49 and lived in California during my teens).</li>
      <li>but it really did work for me, and I&#x27;m sure it will work for everyone, if you give it time.</li>
      <li>Granted, I wasn’t using the full spectrum of their product line</li>
      <li>I end up with this same kind of breakout if I so much as use a suntan cream or any kind of lotion on my face, so this may not be a problem for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t do regular peels, you&#x27;ll like this product and find good results from it.</li>
      <li>my grandmother used to use, but I have been assured that the line is very up-to-date and worthwhile.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very used to exfoliation and using products to increase &#x27;cell turnover&#x27;, so my skin is able to handle these types of products.</li>
      <li>There was mild exfoliation (visible after about 3 days) and no irritation.</li>
      <li>Older Olay product formulas were more perfumy.</li>
      <li>It wasn’t greasy and quickly absorbs into my skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a gentle, easy and non-irritating way to accelerate the exfoliation process.</li>
      <li>After that, I’m very leery of any products with a sun warning because it’s just too easy to one time</li>
      <li>The product did not cause any burning sensation on my hyper sensitive skin and it is very comfortable to sleep with it on your face.</li>
      <li>I liked that facial scrub, but it caused my skin to break out.</li>
      <li>I was surprised at how light and smooth</li>
      <li>; I used to get $200+ glycolic facials to get fresh, rested skin.  </li>
      <li>using this, I feel like I&#x27;m pampering myself, so it is worth it for me.  </li>
      <li>One dropper full is more than enough for face and neck, and it dries quickly.</li>
      <li>Gentle and exfoliating the micro-peel is rich with vitamin b5 to renew skins surface layer by layer with a triple-acid formula that feels soothing--its clinically tested to reveal peel results in just 5 nights.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Get a peel treatment right at home with prox by Olay</li>
      <li>but it seemed to work pretty well.</li>
      <li>Definitely pair with a moisturizer on top.  </li>
      <li>hmmm maybe this stuff really does work!  </li>
      <li>This product does exactly what it says &amp;#34;micro&amp;#34; peel.  </li>
      <li>It did sting a bit at first</li>
      <li>The directions also advise you to use a sunscreen (SPF 15 or higher) after you cleanse your face in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product would probably show better results on skin that actually needs it.</li>
      <li>I used it to the thirty first day.</li>
      <li>The dropper system is different from the photo and is pretty elaborate but works well.</li>
      <li>Since there are so many reviews for this product as used on the face, I thought I would try it on my upper chest.</li>
      <li>First of all, it feels like egg whites on your skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got normally combination skin that leans more toward slightly oily, so that may affect the results I was able to see.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The redness is offset by the lessening of the fine lines, maybe from a little irritation puffiness, but honestly, if you have normal skin you probably won&#x27;t get the redness, just the smoothness.</li>
      <li>: This is a good product for short term use,but nothing beats sleeping enough and consistenly on time..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had good luck with Olay products, especially their Total Effects products.</li>
      <li>The pumper dropper makes it very easy to get just the right amount without any waste.  </li>
      <li>forget to bring the sunscreen and the results were pure</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference...</li>
      <li>I suggest following the instructions, including applying sunscreen in the morning to protect your treated skin from UV light.</li>
      <li>The serum is strangely-textured - I much prefer a cream.</li>
      <li>, I don’t really feel like I got noticeable results with this.  </li>
      <li>Went for my massage yesterday, and they were offering a free facial analysis, so I stuck my head in the &amp;#34;booth&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for about a week and have noticed an improvement with my skin&#x27;s texture and skin tone, but not as much as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
      <li>I immediately started applying it to my whole face, which evened things out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it is really unpleasant-feeling.</li>
      <li>/&gt;What was also very concerning to me is the warning about susceptibility to sunburns and always applying sunscreen in the morning.  </li>
      <li>It has the consistency of egg white, but goes on smooth and blends into my skin well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Adding this hasn&#x27;t done much for me, although it seems to work for others.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Even in my thirties, I still have skin that’s prone to being oily.  With that said, had I known the high amount of glycerin in this product I never would have even bothered trying it.  Oily skin and any sort of greasy feeling moisturizer are never a good mix.  You end up with a breakout of tiny pimples that takes weeks to eradicate.  But everyone’s experience will vary based on their own skin type and, as I said, my skin is very sensitive to this type of thing.  I end up with this same kind of breakout if I so much as use a suntan cream or any kind of lotion on my face, so this may not be a problem for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond breakouts, the other thing I didn’t like about this was the texture.  It’s just kind of slimy.  It reminds me of when you’re greasing a cake pan and some of it gets on your hands.  Only with this you have to wear that greasy layer covering your face overnight and only get to wash it off in the morning.  It didn’t hurt or tingle or sting, but it just felt icky to me.  I couldn’t wait to rinse it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What was also very concerning to me is the warning about susceptibility to sunburns and always applying sunscreen in the morning.  I once used a product with a similar warning and then forgot one morning to apply sunscreen (which was, admittedly, my fault).  I was outside for three to four hours that afternoon and ended up with actual second degree burns on my arms that I still have a scar from nearly a year later.  After that, I’m very leery of any products with a sun warning because it’s just too easy to one time forget to bring the sunscreen and the results were pure agony.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to all that, I don’t really feel like I got noticeable results with this.  Granted, I wasn’t using the full spectrum of their product line they say you’re supposed to be using along with this, and because of the breakouts I didn’t use it longer than a week, but I remain skeptical on any impact it would have had with continued use.</li>
    <li> Love the Olay product line, so I was excited to try out this anti aging night serum.  I applied a small amount of the serum after I cleansed my face in the evening.  The product left a slight tingely feeling that diminished after a few minutes. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and I notice a slight difference in my skin texture.  It appears smoother then before use.  I&#x27;m excited to see continued improvement over time. The product I received from Vine was packaged in a different bottle and is called nightly purifying micro peel.  Not sure if this is a replacement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 3 weeks and see no difference at all. The serum is strangely-textured - I much prefer a cream. And it has this sorta rub-offy thing, I suppose that is the &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; part but it is really unpleasant-feeling. Overall I much prefer my Garnier creams.</li>
    <li> I have pretty sensitive skin so was concerned this may be too strong. It did sting a bit at first but it seemed to work pretty well. I noticed skin looking a bit brighter by the second day because it had peeled a bit.  I tried this after 2 weeks of not using an exfoliant so the product may have just been working on the skin that was clearly ready to be exfoliated (my typical exfoliation process is to use a gentle scrub by YesTo Carrots.)  I am not clear on what the expected usage is - I have used this for a four days and plan to stop after today and start up again in 2 weeks. Happy that the formula was not irritating to my skin - scent is light and pleasant.Older Olay product formulas were more perfumy.</li>
    <li> I have used Retin A on my face for decades and am delighted with the results, but I neglected to use it on my upper chest area, so it looks sun damaged (I&#x27;m 49 and lived in California during my teens). Since there are so many reviews for this product as used on the face, I thought I would try it on my upper chest. Unfortunately, it was not effective at all. The product feels a bit like egg whites when it goes on, but it dries very quickly. I didn&#x27;t notice any tingling sensation at all and no change in my skin after several weeks. If you want visible results, make an appointment with your doctor and ask for a prescription for generic Retin A, in cream form, in the smallest tube possible, If you take your prescription to WalMart, it will be similar in cost to this product and will give you much better results.</li>
    <li> Simply not enough visible results.  A week - practically zilch.  You will do better with a good mask regimen.  If you REALLY need a peel after a few months of that, go to a dermatologist or esthetician.  That will also provide a convincing demonstration that the peel results promised by Olay are a very distant cousin to the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also disliked the residue on the surface of my skin. I tried varying the amount within Olay&#x27;s directed &amp;#34;2-4 pearl sized drops.&amp;#34;  No difference ... and I&#x27;m talking seed pearls, not South Sea. It left a slightly tacky feel hours later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the gimmicky automatic filling dropper doesn&#x27;t work very well.  Mine does fill some when the cap is twisted open, but not always enough to dispense enough product.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife and she reviewed as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a serum, for night use.  On the bottle it is described as a &amp;#34;nightly purifying micro-peel&amp;#34;.  I followed the directions - cleansed my face,  then smoothed on the PROx.  It says to use 2-4 drops - I used 4.  It felt sticky, so I went to read for a few minutes before turning in, thinking the product would either a) soak into my skin or b) dry.  It did neither.  I felt like it just &amp;#34;sat&amp;#34; on my face. (I&#x27;ve always thought a &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; was a product that dried on your skin, then you peeled it off - pulling out the dirt/impurities on your skin with it.)  I finally went to bed after 20 minutes - hey, I was tired!  I woke up the next morning and the PROx still felt sticky on my face and there was a &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; residue on my pillowcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the product again 2 days later, and this time only used 2 drops.  Better results, at least with the stickiness.  Not nearly as sticky and no residue on the pillowcase - my advise - use VERY sparingly!!!  Haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference...yet, but then again, I&#x27;ve only used the product a few times.  The directions also advise you to use a sunscreen (SPF 15 or higher) after you cleanse your face in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; **Note - 2 weeks later - I&#x27;m still using the product, not every night, but 2-3 times a week.  Went for my massage yesterday, and they were offering a free facial analysis, so I stuck my head in the &amp;#34;booth&amp;#34;.  She noted some dryness around my eyes, (duh!) some oiliness around my nose (again, duh!) but she said it looked like I had a low number of enlarged pores...hmmm maybe this stuff really does work!  I had this done a couple of years ago (just before a full facial) and my enlarged pore count was pretty high!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;ve edited this review from my original, which was pretty harsh, and I&#x27;m going to give it the benefit of the doubt...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;end quote&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps someone</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 59 years old and on the 5th day someone actually said to me that I looked like I was in my 40&#x27;s!  No kidding!  I really can feel that my facial skin is softer and the flaky skin I normally see between my eyebrows is gone, although really I expected something dramatic, but there was no peeling involved.  In addition to this product, I am also drinking green smoothies more often and I have added gelatin to my smoothies.  But I did find it odd, that exactly on the 5th day I felt my face looked better when I looked in the mirror.  I&#x27;m on the 11th day now and nothing dramatic.  I&#x27;ll report back when I&#x27;ve done it for 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I admit to not remembering to do this regimen at night.  I do it in the morning because that&#x27;s when I normally do my skin regimen.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve not noticed any burning or skin irritation and there really is no fragrance to speak of.  After I put it on, I feel like I&#x27;ve used one of those egg white facials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is April 12th...and I have to say my face looks really good.  I&#x27;ve increased my rating from 4 stars to 5 stars because although it doesn&#x27;t seem like it is doing anything but it really did work for me, and I&#x27;m sure it will work for everyone, if you give it time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very used to exfoliation and using products to increase &#x27;cell turnover&#x27;, so my skin is able to handle these types of products. With that context, I&#x27;ve had no issues with using the Olay formula, to me it feels gentle and effective in a light way. I usually use a tretenoin cream once or twice a week which tends to leave me with flaking skin after a few days. I did not experience that with the Olay, which I&#x27;ve been using every other night for two weeks. It has kept my complexion clear and even. The dropper system is different from the photo and is pretty elaborate but works well. The liquid is not runny and has a little bit of form to it without being a pure gel. One dropper full is more than enough for face and neck, and it dries quickly. I have been folowing up with my nightly moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had good luck with Olay products, especially their Total Effects products. Since I&#x27;ve been using them, I&#x27;ve seen a marked improvement in the texture of my skin, skin tone, and &amp;#34;age spots,&amp;#34; so I had high expectations for this product. It easily absorbs into my skin (I haven&#x27;t had the slimy/greasy experience that other reviewers have experienced), and hasn&#x27;t caused any burning or itchiness. I&#x27;ve used it for about a week and have noticed an improvement with my skin&#x27;s texture and skin tone, but not as much as I&#x27;d hoped. Since I think this is a product that requires more time to evaluate, I&#x27;m rating it 4 stars now for the noted improvement, and will adjust after two or three weeks with a more detailed review.</li>
    <li> I personally did not see any change from the first day I used it to the thirty first day. I didn&#x27;t notice any peeling going on even in the slightest. I did not see any of my fine lines get lighter or disappear. On the upside, I didn&#x27;t need to use a moisturizer with it and it didn&#x27;t break me out. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be a bad product just not one I&#x27;d purchase since it didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money.  First of all, it feels like egg whites on your skin. That is not real comfortable to sleep with at night. I had read somewhere that results should be seen after 5 days. Not so, no change was seen in 10 days.  A good simple, fragrance free lotion will do much better.</li>
    <li> Olay prox Anti- Aging Nightly Purifying peel works for me . It is really easy to use and does a nice job of restoring your skins brightness and youthful appearance. I had no problems with it causing skin irritation but I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.I am sixty and I feel it is improving my complexion.</li>
    <li> Anyone who is going to look for a quick fix is bound to be disappointed, and patience is the key.Wash your face at night,do not wipe dry but dont leave it dripping wet. It is easy to apply with little bit of moisture in the skin. Take 2 drops apply to one side of the face, on top of the nose and another pebble to other side of the face. I will not say it is a burning sensation but a low grade burning feeling initially pops up, so you are better off trying the first night on a small patch to see for any reaction .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife was disappointed with no appreciable difference for many days.. but It does show the result, after 10-15 days of everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY: This is a good product for short term use,but nothing beats sleeping enough and consistenly on time.. Nature&#x27;s own way!</li>
    <li> The texture of the liquid was gooey and a little thick. It&#x27;s a serum so I expected that. After using it for about 4 nights I noticed that my skin had begun to peel in areas. It was great for sloughing off when I cleansed my face. The more I used it the more I noticed the flaky skin. I slowed down the pace and now only use twice a week. It does the job though so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says &amp;#34;micro&amp;#34; peel.  I could feel a very fine and minute peel the first day, but after than nothing.  I am not sure that using this every day will make a difference.  When I want a peel, I want to see a little more results.  On the positives though, there was no redness or irritation.  I would only recommend this product if you had an event to go to and needed a last minute peel that did not look red or obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among some ingredients I cannot pronounce, the main active ingredients appear to be Glycolic Acid, Citric Acid, Lactic Acid,  Aloe Leaf Juice Powder, Calendula Flower Extract, and Ginger Root Extract.  So, an added plus is that there does seem to be some natural ingredients.  However, for the money, I wanted to see more results.</li>
    <li> This product would probably show better results on skin that actually needs it. I already have nice skin and I exfoliate at least 3 times a week. I have some discoloration on my neck from a bad heat rash and I hoped this product would speed up the fading and blending. No such luck. It would be useful as a start to a regular regimen of nightly cleasing.</li>
    <li> I admit, I was slightly apprehensive when I saw the phrase &#x27;micro-peel&#x27; on the description, but my skin is a mess from the cold winter so I decided to give it a try and had mixed results. Granted, my skin is far from normal and I&#x27;ve had redness from much more expensive creams than this one who didn&#x27;t even claim to be a micro-peel. It did make my face somewhat tomato-y after a few days and had a tendency to stay that way, but cosmetics covered it, and I&#x27;m sure the glycolic acid had something to do with it. Once I added another moisturizer under my makeup it calmed down some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The redness is offset by the lessening of the fine lines, maybe from a little irritation puffiness, but honestly, if you have normal skin you probably won&#x27;t get the redness, just the smoothness. My only dislike was a slight stickiness in the morning- but you&#x27;re going to wash that off anyway. In the long run I think I will use this for several weeks and then switch to a heavy night cream for several weeks. That way I should get the best of both.</li>
    <li> I love this. The pumper dropper makes it very easy to get just the right amount without any waste.  It goes on easy and does not really sting like many other micro peel products.  I could tell a noticeable difference in just 5 days as it states.  I am not sure if one should use this indefinitely or not?  I will probably give it 2 or 3 weeks for the more long term over time effect it claims and then take a break back to my nightly moisturizer and then circle back after a period of time.  I also want to mention that I have been using this with a daytime moisturizer, broad spectrum with sunscreen spf 15 as it states you should.  My winter skin is snapping into noticeably better, softer shape from using the Olay line.  Marilyn</li>
    <li> My honey is happy with this.  Already a fan of the Olay products, my sweetie was excited to try this.  Apparently it&#x27;s a hit.  I keep hearing things like &amp;#34;firmer&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;clearer&amp;#34; although I honestly haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.  Don&#x27;t read this review, honey.  I remember Olay as that pink cream my grandmother used to use, but I have been assured that the line is very up-to-date and worthwhile.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, my interest is peeked when I spot a product that claims to help your skin look younger. I have been a fan of Olay products forever. My grandmother used Olay face cream for as long as I can remember, and she looked great until the day she passed away at the age of 91.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon spotting OLAY PROX ANTI-AGING NIGHTLY PURIFYING MICRO-PEEL, 1.3 FLUID OUNCE I decided to give it a try. I was surprised at how light and smooth it goes on. It wasn’t greasy and quickly absorbs into my skin. Easy to apply. I have used it several nights in a row, and have only noticed a slight difference. Perhaps after using it for a longer period of time I will begin to notice a greater change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Information:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Professionally designed nightly facial peel to help purify skins surface for a younger look over time&lt;br /&gt;• Prox technology is clinically tested to improve skins exfoliation rate and deliver peel results at home in just 5 nights&lt;br /&gt;• The formula gently promotes skins natural restoring process with rejuvenating vitamin B5 for a proven triple-acid formula that renews skins surface&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Description:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get a peel treatment right at home with prox by Olay anti-aging nightly purifying micro-peel.

    <li> I&#x27;ve tried different things to combat aging skin. All except for this one, have not made a difference. I think it&#x27;s because this product does more than moisturize. It has the same effect as gently scrubbing one&#x27;s skin, thereby removing old surface skin cells, allowing new ones to grow. Now that I mention that, the only other product that seems to have worked like this one, was a gritty facial scrubbing compound. I liked that facial scrub, but it caused my skin to break out. This product had only positive, and no adverse effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are supposed to see results in 5 days. I didn&#x27;t think anything would happen to tell you the truth, so I put it on only part of my face. After the 3rd day or so, I noticed that the treated skin was looking cleaner, smoother, and lighter (perhaps due to new skin cells). It wasn&#x27;t a stark difference, but I could see it. I immediately started applying it to my whole face, which evened things out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying it, it feels like you have a layer of glaze on your face - almost like a thin mask. It&#x27;s tacky to the touch and would probably stay that way all night. I move around and some of it probably comes off on the towel I place on my pillow. I suggest following the instructions, including applying sunscreen in the morning to protect your treated skin from UV light.</li>
    <li> This is part of their Pro X line, so it&#x27;s on the more expensive end of Olay products. For those who are looking for a way to clear their skin that is safe, gentle and feels really good, this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It uses a dropper to dispense the product, and that makes it really easy to get the right amount, and you don&#x27;t waste any by having it drip all over the place as it doesn&#x27;t release the product into your hand until you want it to. What I really liked was the way it felt on my face. It immediately felt soft, and if you follow the five day test, you will see a difference. Olay has always been a favorite for me, and as I get older, I find their products to be some of the best because they do the job, and they&#x27;re gentle too. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I liked this particularly because it wasn&#x27;t as aggressive on my skin as I thought it would be. There was mild exfoliation (visible after about 3 days) and no irritation. The glycerin does a good job of moisturizing the skin and my face was not red from using this as with more aggressive peels. My skin looked perceptibly better--not a big change for me (older, thinner skin, if that might make a difference) but still, a definite improvement in freshness and appearance and no negative side effects.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t do regular peels, you&#x27;ll like this product and find good results from it. It&#x27;s a gentle, easy and non-irritating way to accelerate the exfoliation process. (I use TCA peels and glycolic acid peels regularly, they do in one use what the Olay would take constant use to achieve)&lt;br /&gt;I used this every night for two weeks and didn&#x27;t do any of my other peels and my face stayed soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use this within 2 weeks of using Retin-A or any acid peels, it will sting like heck!!!</li>
    <li> Works well in just a few days. It goes on like a thin gel and you get a little bit of a dried sheen on your face. Definitely for overnight due to this. Took care of a little redness alongside the nose for me within a few days. I used it with the Olay face wash and didn&#x27;t have issues. My wife tried the same but was irratated by a little to much of the acids designed to help the dead skin flake off. She gave up on the wash but kept the peel. There are a few types of acids that work to break up the dead skin bonds, you may just have to find the right one for you. I liked this as did my wife.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this Olay Purifying Micro Peel for two separate 5-night sessions with about two weeks in between.  I&#x27;ve got normally combination skin that leans more toward slightly oily, so that may affect the results I was able to see.  My skin does feel softer after the first few days, but I don&#x27;t see noticeable exfoliation ie skin sloughing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not experience any pinkness or tenderness, but I was also careful to not be in direct sunlight as your skin will be more sensitive when using products like this (which is not uncommon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using this, I feel like I&#x27;m pampering myself, so it is worth it for me.  My skin feels nice, soft and clean.  While I can&#x27;t speak to how well it is actually working to bring up new layers of skin, I do feel my skin feels fresher after using it for a few days, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see myself using this all the time, but rather, when I want to pamper myself and spend a tiny bit more time on my skin in the evening (really, a few extra seconds as it is really easy to use!!)</li>
    <li> It has the consistency of egg white, but goes on smooth and blends into my skin well. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry. Skin feels soft and there&#x27;s no oily residue. The serum promises benefits after 5 nights. After using for 2 weeks, there&#x27;s no visible &#x27;peeling or renewal&#x27; effect on my skin. I had to recheck the packaging to make sure it was a micro-peel and not just some moisturizing treatment. I do love the bottle and design of the pump. The pump automatically refills when cap is unscrewed and a single drop is more than enough to cover my whole face.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing product; I used to get $200+ glycolic facials to get fresh, rested skin.  This product provides the perfect amount of glycolic acid for a daily/weekly product, and I truly think even after a couple weeks my skin looks fresh, hydrated, and rested.  Definitely pair with a moisturizer on top.  Fantastic bargain compared to $200+ facials.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a slight difference in my skin after a couple weeks....nothing major but it is definitely is doing something. it does tingle after applying --which doesn&#x27;t bother me --but might to some people.</li>
    <li> I really love this glycolic acid treatment. According to Beautypedia, this was given a BEST rating, has a very high percentage of AHA, and has the correct pH for it to work as a chemical exfoliant. I have been using this product for several weeks and I can see a difference in acne, tone, clarity, and texture of my skin. I use this after toner and before serum/moisturizer, but you can also use this directly after cleansing by itself (no moisturizer or serum) as an intensive treatment! This also has the repairing ingredient niacinamide, which is hard to come across in drugstore products. VERY GOOD!</li>
    <li> I have used this product by the directions on the label nightly for a few weeks and haven&#x27;t seen a noticeable difference in my lines, wrinkles, or the texture of my skin. I do not have acne or other blemishes, so I can&#x27;t say if it helps with that, but I got better results from bi-weekly micro peel products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The droplet dispenser is unique and takes a little getting used to. I grew to like it. The product did not cause any burning sensation on my hyper sensitive skin and it is very comfortable to sleep with it on your face.</li>
    <li> Even though I am a guy, I try to take care of my skin. In the winter, it gets dry, and I try to avoid that. I typically use a Vitamin A and Retin-A mixed cream on my face before bed (I mix it myself using Vitamin A softgels, lotion, and Retin-A), and then put a vitamin C cream on in the morning. This tends to keep my skin healthy, toned, and moisturized. I also use a salicylic acid based wash in the shower along with moisturizing body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding this hasn&#x27;t done much for me, although it seems to work for others. I have tried it for over a week faithfully and I don&#x27;t see much of a change. If anything, my skin looks a little rougher. This could be because I stopped the Retin-A during this period, or that combining this formula (which contains an Alpha-Hydroxy Acid) with salicylic acid (a Beta-Hydoxy Acid) could be overkill, and drying my skin out. Nonetheless, I didn&#x27;t feel anything or see any results from this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product goes on easily, although it is kind of gooey. The dispenser is convenient. The price seems kind of high, but that is typical of beauty products.  Overall, I will choose other options, but for some people this might work.</li>
    <li> This product went on comfortably; I didn&#x27;t feel a sting or anything like some of the other reviewers.  It feels ok on my skin, but after using it I had an increase in breakouts which isn&#x27;t that surprising and hopefully it&#x27;s just cleaning out my pores.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference to the softness of my skin, but I&#x27;ll use it a while longer to see if I can notice a difference.</li>
</ol>
