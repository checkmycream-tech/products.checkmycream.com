      <li>-It&#x27;s just look more healthy.    </li>
      <li>, I liked then, is light does not have any smell or perfume, it feels clean</li>
      <li>Too strong of a smell.</li>
      <li>Works fine.</li>
      <li>am planning to purchase the cleaning BWC lotion (meanwhile am I shopping for a reasonably priced &amp; effective cleaning face brush) to used along with this products.</li>
      <li>Beauty Without Cruelty cosmetics are fantastic.</li>
      <li>It feels light on the skin and non greasy.</li>
      <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a great C topical</li>
      <li>is RIGHT ON!</li>
      <li>A Vitamin C serum is an essential part of my skin care routine, but it has to be a good one.</li>
      <li>I have been trying this product for the first time and so far so good.</li>
      <li>Great product, works miracles in due time.</li>
      <li>Not oily or greasy and drys quick.  </li>
      <li>My face is oily enough that I can&#x27;t really wear moisturizer during the day but this is AMAZING!  </li>
      <li>Keeps my skin fresh and radiant without the greasy look and feel.</li>
      <li>It is not in my opinion suitable for use alone, as it is absorbed very quickly and is not very moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>has barely a scent and is very light weight and non-greasy..</li>
      <li>I like this serum very much.</li>
      <li>For the record, it is a good consistency and if my skin could have handled it, it might have given great results.  :(</li>
      <li>Works great and is a lot cheaper than other brands that will do the same thing.</li>
      <li>It definitely smells citrus-y, but I&#x27;m fine with that.</li>
      <li>I use about a pump a day (1/2 in the morning, 1/2 at night) and my skin has healed from breakouts so much faster than before.</li>
      <li>I really like the product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight, but not watery, and one bottle lasts me 2-3 months.</li>
      <li>I much prefer the Body Shop&#x27;s Vitamin C serum to this one.</li>
      <li>I switched from Image Vital C ($$$$) and like this just as much!</li>
      <li>Highly allergic and returned...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very light moisturizer that wasn&#x27;t enough for my dry skin.</li>
      <li>The main thing I like about it that&#x27;s not involving a lot of chemicals and  can apply it on the sensitive skin around my eyes.    </li>
      <li>Price is not bad compared to other serums.</li>
      <li>my skin is a bit too sensitive for this product</li>
      <li>The Vitamin C is MAP, and the essential oils are very soothing and nourishing</li>
      <li>My mother and I have used this product for about 2 years now,  and we both love it, mix a small amount in your hand with you daily face lotion and within a week it brightens and smooths your skin.</li>
      <li>I found this combination of ingredients works really well on African American skin so with reluctance I tried ...</li>
      <li>I have very dry, sensitive skin, and this treatment was a little too strong for me.  </li>

    <li> I use it as a moisturizer day and night with Hyluronic acid.  It&#x27;s feel so nice and I love the smell.   The main thing I like about it that&#x27;s not involving a lot of chemicals and  can apply it on the sensitive skin around my eyes.    With the combine of Hyaluronic acid I am noticing great skin improvement:  -Less black circle  -My skin look shiny but not greasy]  -It&#x27;s just look more healthy.    The other day I even went grocery shopping with NO makeup foundation! (I didn&#x27;t felt insecure about my black circles)     Great product without been cruel to animals.</li>
    <li> Feels nice on the skin.  Does the job.</li>
    <li> I have been trying this product for the first time and so far so good. It feels light on the skin and non greasy.</li>
    <li> Great product, works miracles in due time. Have to be patient for the results. Amazing stuff.</li>
    <li> Smells kind of orange-y. Works fine.</li>
    <li> Works great and is a lot cheaper than other brands that will do the same thing. Keeps my skin fresh and radiant without the greasy look and feel.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle in a bottle.my skin is softer clearer and the texture is soooo much better after researching I found this combination of ingredients works really well on African American skin so with reluctance I tried ... what can I say a miracle in a tiny bottle</li>
    <li> This product is average to me.  I usually use a similar product by Pevonia and thought I&#x27;d give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably use it up, but will not order again.  Not enough moisturizer for my needs, and my skin is a bit too sensitive for this product</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic. I use about a pump a day (1/2 in the morning, 1/2 at night) and my skin has healed from breakouts so much faster than before. It definitely smells citrus-y, but I&#x27;m fine with that. It&#x27;s very lightweight, but not watery, and one bottle lasts me 2-3 months. I will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> My mother and I have used this product for about 2 years now,  and we both love it, mix a small amount in your hand with you daily face lotion and within a week it brightens and smooths your skin. Plus vitamin C is super good for your face!!! has barely a scent and is very light weight and non-greasy..I would recommend this to others!</li>
    <li> I use this every single morning &amp; evening! Just a small squirt and it covers entire face &amp; neck. Love it.</li>
    <li> very good serum my face look more radiant Am happy with purchase</li>
    <li> I really like the product.  I initially purchased at a Vitamin shop chain, I liked then, is light does not have any smell or perfume, it feels clean and I feel it moisturizes nicely. (&amp; does not have 2 inches of ingredients in the list of ingredients).  I saw it on line a bit cheaper.  I like the lotion, I think it hydrates well and is moderately priced.  I have read that Vitamin C is beneficial to Skin renewal; I have seen  (I only watch Dr Oz occasionally) in  Dr. Oz &#x27;s show two guest  guest dermatologists (confirm what I read about vitamin C) talking about the benefits of using  lotions with Vitamin C, daily skin cleaning (along with at least bi-weakly exfoliation with cleaning brush  see Dr Oz show around late Summr. 2013) how helps moisturize and nourish face&#x27;s skin .&lt;br /&gt;I am planning to purchase the cleaning BWC lotion (meanwhile am I shopping for a reasonably priced &amp; effective cleaning face brush) to used along with this products. Who are Not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend BWC product for the quality and the price. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Used before applying the Beauty with Cruelty Renewal Moisturizer Vitamin C with coq10, which I reviewed on this site.  Both products worked very well to revitalize my complexion to make a perfect dual treatment.  I applied once in the morning.</li>
    <li> This is the best non-greasy facial serum I&#x27;ve found.  I like to where it under my foundation.  And, Amazon has the best  price I&#x27;ve been able to find, too.  Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> Highly allergic and returned...which is weird because I&#x27;m NOT allergic to the Vitamin C cream.  I wanted to like it, but my face did not :(</li>
    <li> Great product.  Not oily or greasy and drys quick.  I have been using this for a couple months and plan to continue using it as a regular part of my skin care regime.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very light moisturizer that wasn&#x27;t enough for my dry skin. I also noticed that it made my skin feel a little irritated and red.</li>
    <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin, and this treatment was a little too strong for me.  For the record, it is a good consistency and if my skin could have handled it, it might have given great results.  :(</li>
    <li> My friend recommended the product, I tried it and loved it! It works great with my skin. I can feel it tightening and it soothes my skin. It is just as good as the vitamin C serum that I pay over $55.00 at the salon I go to.</li>
    <li> This serum is great. It absorbs so quickly as if I never put it on. My skin drinks it up. I have not noticed and miraculous changes to my skin from it ( It&#x27;s not like any other face lotion does) but I like how my skin does absorb it well.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a great C topical it&#x27;s really good for nights because you&#x27;re sleeping I wouldn&#x27;t put it on during the daytime that&#x27;s none sinceit is really good for your skin though I will buy again but I don&#x27;t know where at maybe jet</li>
    <li> Very nice smelling - soaks right in and not greasy - no yuck on my pillow.  My face is oily enough that I can&#x27;t really wear moisturizer during the day but this is AMAZING!  My skin is softer and clearer and just beautiful.  I&#x27;ve gotten comments at work about how I&#x27;m &#x27;glowing&#x27;.  LOVE IT and the price is RIGHT ON!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, pale, dry-ish combination skin and I am passionate about skin care. A Vitamin C serum is an essential part of my skin care routine, but it has to be a good one. I like this serum very much. I compare ingredients before buying any face product, and this serum has very good ingredients! The Vitamin C is MAP, and the essential oils are very soothing and nourishing types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this morning and night beneath my moisturizer/sunscreen. I put it all over my face and neck, including my eye area. It is great for skin tone and for healing the skin. It is slightly moisturizing, but not at all greasy or oily. It is not in my opinion suitable for use alone, as it is absorbed very quickly and is not very moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am on my second bottle of this stuff now and I hope they never reformulate it! I will repurchase as long as the quality is maintained.</li>
    <li> Too strong of a smell.</li>
    <li> Anytime I can find new products that work great AND are cruelty free, I am thrilled! Beauty Without Cruelty cosmetics are fantastic. I also use the mascara and face lotion and couldn&#x27;t be happier. I&#x27;ve noticed since using the Vitamin C, Vitality serum that my skin has a brighter look to it and my pores are smaller. My skin looks and feels smoother. I would definitely recommend any product from BWC. You get to be kind to bunnies AND look great - what more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s really good for brown skin tones, as it helps to even out the skin, and give you a healthy glow.</li>
    <li> I love this vitamin c serum. Price is not bad compared to other serums. It makes a big difference. I used it at night and in the morning with my spf.</li>
    <li> I had used this serum once before and I remembered it being creamier. This stuff is a bit &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; although they may have changed the format...I like way it feels on my skin.</li>
    <li> Performs as advertised. I switched from Image Vital C ($$$$) and like this just as much!</li>
    <li> LOVE this serum! Nice citrus smell, my face glows since I&#x27;ve been using this and also when I apply my powder it goes on smoother and looks nice and creamy! Get this you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> very sorry that this company now uses phenoxyethanol as a preservative. its as bad for you as all the parabans. will not purchase bwc products anymore until they remove it.</li>
    <li> nice product, great price</li>
    <li> I love using Vitamin C serums on my face daily but was not impressed with this one at all - it&#x27;s very thin and has a medicinal smell to it. I just wasn&#x27;t cracked about it. I much prefer the Body Shop&#x27;s Vitamin C serum to this one.</li>
