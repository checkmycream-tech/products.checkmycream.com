### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The product is wonderful!  </li>
      <li>The bottle had the best price to ounce ratio and is basically why I got it.</li>
      <li>She said that my hair was beautiful.  </li>
      <li>She also noticed the great condition of my hair.  </li>
      <li>This price is great as well - cheaper than even when it is on sale at retail stores</li>
      <li>Definitely great value here</li>
      <li>Makes me hair feel nice!</li>
      <li>this bottle is good value and good for hair.  </li>
      <li>AND yes, it gives it some good bounce/volume.  </li>
      <li>Pump style is a good feature as well.</li>
      <li>Good price and amount for the product.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Honest, it will disappear into the hair shaft.&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
      <li>Thought it was the one I really liked.</li>
      <li>First, this does not smell very good.</li>
      <li>My hair is also very fine, but I have a LOT of it</li>
      <li>It smells good without being overwhelming or smelling cheap.  </li>
      <li>If you have damaged hair, use jojoba oil, or argan oil (the pure organic oils; both work great).  </li>
      <li>We love Pantene and the convenience of the pump on this large bottle is great.  </li>
      <li>I love the conditioner and Pantene know longer makes this version.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair looking great, despite living in a very hostile environment.  </li>
      <li>Most conditioners for color treated or damaged hair contain a lot of oil and conditioners that coat your hair; you&#x27;ll have to wash more often as a result.  </li>
      <li>I get pretty good additional volume with each wash, and my hair is shiny and well-moisterized.</li>
      <li>price is pretty good too considering you can&#x27;t buy this size in the store.  </li>
      <li>Jojoba oil has the closest properties to sebum, you&#x27;re body&#x27;s natural oil; Argan works great too.  </li>
      <li>it rinses easily and does not feel like there&#x27;s residue.  </li>
      <li>This is a good conditioner from Pantene whose products are always decent.</li>
      <li>From the first day, my hair was very clean, light weight, and shiny.  </li>
      <li>The vast majority of shampoos give me dandruff or itchiness, but this one has consistently been a great product over the years.</li>
      <li>The Pantene Pro-V Volumizing Conditioner is my absolute favorite.  </li>
      <li>It was top of the shoulder length and didn&#x27;t seem to want to get much longer.  </li>
      <li>i like pantene because it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and it smells great.  </li>
      <li>Worth it to use for my hair</li>
      <li>More importantly, after the second day my husband noticed a difference (and he doesn&#x27;t notice things like that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>and i&#x27;ve decided that pantene is the best, especially the flat to volume one, i&#x27;d highly suggest.  </li>
      <li>I love that it comes with a pump top, it just plain makes it easier to use.</li>
      <li>This is the only shampoo I&#x27;ve found that makes my baby fine hair feel full</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s been 14 months; I&#x27;ve used many different brands of conditioners.  </li>
      <li>When I first started co-washing, my hair was damaged from highlighting.  </li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve tried pretty much store bought brand</li>
      <li>My hair volume is consistent from root to tip; as a result my hair appears much &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>and I dont have much hair plus</li>
      <li>Second, I have to use a lot of this conditioner in order to make my hair smooth,  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to take care of their hair.</li>
      <li>I have always used Pantene, it works better than most expensive shampoos.</li>
      <li>I have extremely fine, straight, blond hair; it was so limp that my stylist was surprised at how much I had.  </li>
      <li>first, it seems counter intuitive, especially if your hair is particularly oily.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t the updated new formula,  Hope I can reorder</li>
      <li>So, my 50 year old hair had color, in one form or another, for 30 years.</li>
      <li>My hair has volume and my curls are soft &amp; bouncy again.</li>
      <li>HIGHLY recommend this item if you have similar hair texture.</li>
      <li>My fine straight hair simply shows oil easier than someone with thick curly hair.</li>
      <li>even though I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, I wet it and condition it) and I can say that it&#x27;s light (as in doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down) but it conditions it well</li>
      <li>Give it time; I noticed a difference from the first day, but it&#x27;s taken almost a year for me to get to the point that I can wash my hair every other day and not daily.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a biochemist, so a quick review of the typical ingredients in conditioners, revealed enough surfactants to properly cleanse hair, without the use of foaming additives, which strip hair.  </li>
      <li>I do NOT like flat hair (straight hair is NOT the same as flat - flat</li>

<li> Because my hair had gotten so damaged from flat ironing it</li>
<li> , I won&#x27;t have to buy another for a long, long time.</li>
<li> week ago my stylist noticed how long my hair has gotten (shoulder blade length, and that&#x27;s with trims every 2 months).  </li>
<li> only thing I changed in my routine was to apply the conditioner to my wet hair at the start of my shower, do my shower routine, then rinse.</li>
<li> Frankly, expensive conditioners don&#x27;t do a better job, you&#x27;re just washing money down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
<li> I am of mixed race (black/white) and my hair is extremely curly.</li>
<li> So, I ordered this with some skepticism because I&#x27;ve been down this flat road before, it&#x27;s long, and well, FLAT ;-</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll going to continue to use this and alternate it with my other conditioners!</li>
<li> Use 1 or 2 drops, rubbed in your hands, and work it into the damaged areas of your hair, while your hair is wet, not the scalp (unless you have a dry scalp).  </li>
<li> (I&#x27;m also taking Biotin to hopefully help it grow back and fall out less) and</li>
<li> multiple times a week, my curls had become very limp and flat.</li>
<li> There is absolutely no build up.  </li>
<li> This product really does add volume to my thin and limp hair.  </li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t seem quite as thick as the regular sized Pantene.</li>
<li> I do spray a little Sun-In on the roots every couple of months.  </li>
<li> no sure if I will purchase again.</li>
<li> No more wasting money on products that don&#x27;t work.</li>
<li> After watching the conditioning cleaning product infomercial from a well known stylist (you know the one; the stuff is VERY EXPENSIVE), I decided to experiment with cleaning my hair with CONDITIONER ONLY.  </li>
<li> my curly hair saw a dramatic change.</li>
<li> Unfortunately they just took it off subscribe and save so</li>

    <li> We love Pantene and the convenience of the pump on this large bottle is great.  Unfortunately they just took it off subscribe and save so no sure if I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love the conditioner and Pantene know longer makes this version. I don&#x27;t the updated new formula,  Hope I can reorder</li>
    <li> Bought after realizing COSTCO&#x27;s was labeled differently. Thought it was the one I really liked. After this I will return to COSTCO&#x27;s Pantene version as seems the same and cheaper there.</li>
    <li> i like pantene because it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and it smells great.  it rinses easily and does not feel like there&#x27;s residue.  i&#x27;ve tried pretty much store bought brand and i&#x27;ve decided that pantene is the best, especially the flat to volume one, i&#x27;d highly suggest.  price is pretty good too considering you can&#x27;t buy this size in the store.  subscribe and save!</li>
    <li> After watching the conditioning cleaning product infomercial from a well known stylist (you know the one; the stuff is VERY EXPENSIVE), I decided to experiment with cleaning my hair with CONDITIONER ONLY.  I&#x27;m a biochemist, so a quick review of the typical ingredients in conditioners, revealed enough surfactants to properly cleanse hair, without the use of foaming additives, which strip hair.  So, 14 months ago, I used shampoo for the very last time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, it seems counter intuitive, especially if your hair is particularly oily.  I have extremely fine, straight, blond hair; it was so limp that my stylist was surprised at how much I had.  I highlighted my hair, to give it some body, and prior to that I colored my  hair.  So, my 50 year old hair had color, in one form or another, for 30 years. It was top of the shoulder length and didn&#x27;t seem to want to get much longer.  My scalp is oily, so I wash(ed) and conditioned my hair daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I changed in my routine was to apply the conditioner to my wet hair at the start of my shower, do my shower routine, then rinse. I don&#x27;t putz around with combs, and I don&#x27;t use copious amounts of water to rinse.  I simply put put it in, shower, then rinse.  From the first day, my hair was very clean, light weight, and shiny.  More importantly, after the second day my husband noticed a difference (and he doesn&#x27;t notice things like that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it&#x27;s been 14 months; I&#x27;ve used many different brands of conditioners.  I&#x27;ve also used the cleansing conditioners made by L&#x27;Oreal and Salon Grafix (made specifically for this purpose).  The Pantene Pro-V Volumizing Conditioner is my absolute favorite.  I&#x27;ve used it for 4 weeks now; My hair is even shiner.  There is absolutely no build up.  It smells good without being overwhelming or smelling cheap.  It&#x27;s gentler than either the L&#x27;Oreal or Salon Grafix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 week ago my stylist noticed how long my hair has gotten (shoulder blade length, and that&#x27;s with trims every 2 months).  She also noticed the great condition of my hair.  She said that my hair was beautiful.  No one has EVER said that to me.  I&#x27;ve not had the stylist highlight my hair, since I started this experiment.  I do spray a little Sun-In on the roots every couple of months.  So, you could say that co-washing has saved me a boatload of money, as well as my hair.  My hair volume is consistent from root to tip; as a result my hair appears much &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34;.  Here are some things I&#x27;ve learned:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Use inexpensive conditioner.  Frankly, expensive conditioners don&#x27;t do a better job, you&#x27;re just washing money down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Choose conditioner for the type of hair you have WITHOUT REGARD TO COLORING.  I cannot stress this enough.  Most conditioners for color treated or damaged hair contain a lot of oil and conditioners that coat your hair; you&#x27;ll have to wash more often as a result.  They build up over time.  You&#x27;ll have to trust me; it&#x27;s the shampoo that&#x27;s stripping your salon color, not the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;3.  If you have damaged hair, use jojoba oil, or argan oil (the pure organic oils; both work great).  When I first started co-washing, my hair was damaged from highlighting.  Jojoba oil has the closest properties to sebum, you&#x27;re body&#x27;s natural oil; Argan works great too.  Use 1 or 2 drops, rubbed in your hands, and work it into the damaged areas of your hair, while your hair is wet, not the scalp (unless you have a dry scalp).  Honest, it will disappear into the hair shaft.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Give it time; I noticed a difference from the first day, but it&#x27;s taken almost a year for me to get to the point that I can wash my hair every other day and not daily.  My fine straight hair simply shows oil easier than someone with thick curly hair.</li>
    <li> This product really does add volume to my thin and limp hair.  I love it! No more wasting money on products that don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Worth it to use for my hair</li>
    <li> This is a lot of conditioner! Definitely great value here, I won&#x27;t have to buy another for a long, long time. As always, Pantene is second to none when it comes to conditioners. I get pretty good additional volume with each wash, and my hair is shiny and well-moisterized.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t seem quite as thick as the regular sized Pantene.</li>
    <li> This is a good conditioner from Pantene whose products are always decent. Not sure if it really enhances hair volume but it works well for me in styling my hair. Good price and amount for the product. Pump style is a good feature as well.</li>
    <li> The product is wonderful!  It leaves my hair looking great, despite living in a very hostile environment.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to take care of their hair.</li>
    <li> So, I did research on this product because 1. I&#x27;m losing my hair and want it to look fuller (I&#x27;m also taking Biotin to hopefully help it grow back and fall out less) and 2. I do NOT like flat hair (straight hair is NOT the same as flat - flat is blecky!!) So, I ordered this with some skepticism because I&#x27;ve been down this flat road before, it&#x27;s long, and well, FLAT ;-( but I took the plunge and got it.  I&#x27;m only washing my hair every 2 or 3 days but I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner every day (even though I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, I wet it and condition it) and I can say that it&#x27;s light (as in doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down) but it conditions it well AND yes, it gives it some good bounce/volume.  I&#x27;ll going to continue to use this and alternate it with my other conditioners!</li>
    <li> (From my wife) This is my go-to for conditioner. The vast majority of shampoos give me dandruff or itchiness, but this one has consistently been a great product over the years. I love that it comes with a pump top, it just plain makes it easier to use. Don&#x27;t know how long the pump will last as I have only had this a couple of weeks. If it breaks before the bottle is finished, I will adjust my review.</li>
    <li> this bottle is good value and good for hair.  hair is eay to manage with regular use.  doesn&#x27;t  seem to affect hair color.</li>
    <li> I will never use another shampoo/conditioner. I am of mixed race (black/white) and my hair is extremely curly. My hair is also very fine, but I have a LOT of it so it looks thicker than it actually is. Because my hair had gotten so damaged from flat ironing it multiple times a week, my curls had become very limp and flat. Once I started using this conditioner (along with the volume shampoo) my curly hair saw a dramatic change. My hair has volume and my curls are soft &amp; bouncy again. HIGHLY recommend this item if you have similar hair texture.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo I&#x27;ve found that makes my baby fine hair feel full and it comes with the added bonus of being inexpensive!!!</li>
    <li> I have always used Pantene, it works better than most expensive shampoos. This price is great as well - cheaper than even when it is on sale at retail stores</li>
    <li> The bottle had the best price to ounce ratio and is basically why I got it. Makes me hair feel nice!</li>
    <li> I dont like this pro-v conditioner. First, this does not smell very good. Second, I have to use a lot of this conditioner in order to make my hair smooth,  and I dont have much hair plus my  hair are very short.</li>
