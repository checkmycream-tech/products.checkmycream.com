<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this because of the reviews here on Amazon and because of the price. It doesn&#x27;t hold my curls at all and it gets sticky feeling if you try to add more. The only thing good about this product is it&#x27;s smell. It smells really fresh and nice, but holding curl?? NO, not at all.</li>
    <li> I was surprised it wasn&#x27;t more of a mousse type product but it works great to help my natural curl come thru</li>
    <li> it was supposed to enhance the curls.  but it didn&#x27;t..  will go back to be curly by Aveda.</li>
    <li> I have natural curly hair and this did nothing for me.  It felt like putting water in my hair.</li>
    <li> This product works great for hair that is already curly whether natural or from a perm, it keeps it from being frizzy without making it greasy or stiff. I really do love it and I have not found anything else that does this for my hair.</li>
    <li> i have used several of the products in this line over the years and have been happy with them so was excited to try this product. The first thing I noticed was the hideous Chemical smell that hung on my hair all day, and that was just spraying one section. For that reason alone I would have to return it as I could not stand the odor, and I am not sensitive to scent. The other thing was it made my hair stiff, like hairspray-from-decades-ago stiff. Maybe it is just not right for my hair type: thick, coarse, naturally curly hair with a lot of body. I am sorry to say this one will be returned to the store.</li>
    <li> Great product for naturally curly hair.  Curls galore!</li>
    <li> Very happy with product.</li>
    <li> I just love this product. I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue making it.</li>
    <li> i use this with the curls booster creme, it gives a little crunch but definately the best product i use for my inbetween curly and wavy hair</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have tried that doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy or crunchy. It makes my hair shiny and it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> This works great to support the curls without making hair crunchy or sticky. The next day if you don&#x27;t want to wash your hair you can just spray with water and revive this Curls Rock you put in the day before. I love the Curls Rock in this light blue spray can better than the purple can version.</li>
    <li> This is really just hairspray - it helps the curls a bit, but mostly it holds in place your existing curls. But I love the whole product line.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really really great..your hair is not stiff and stickey..leaves it so nice soft feeling and GREAT curls!!</li>
    <li> Have naturally wavy hair and have used it for the past 5 years. I used to buy it at Walmart then they quit carrying it.  I bought it at a beauty warehouse for awhile but finally just started ordering 5 cans at a time online. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy hair that is very thick, this product sometimes makes it slightly frizzy, but nothing that can&#x27;t be smoothed out with a bit of hair oil. Also, too much in one spot makes hair slightly crunchy, really only if too much is used though. Overall, this is the best product I&#x27;ve found yet in bringing out natural waves in my hair, and I will keep using it...I&#x27;m currently on my 5th bottle :)</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair very curly.  It can dry your hair somewhat but I only use it when I want curls.</li>
    <li> Product was great for my soft curls,no sticky residue..sad it&#x27;s no longer available.</li>
    <li> Love it! manageable curls, great scent, not too sticky or too hard. Perfect for me</li>
    <li> Love this product, but it is hit or miss in the stores. Works great on curly hair!  So excited to be able to get it sent to me monthly without having to try to find it in stores when I run out!!</li>
    <li> This helps keep my wavy hair style looking great for a long time.</li>
    <li> If you have curly hair and want to retain those curls this is the product for you...will never understand why it was taken off the retail market...it&#x27;s the best and then some...</li>
    <li> I really like the Tigi Catwalk Curls Rock Booster spray for my curls instead of regular hair spray. It helps form the curls a little more, helps frizz, and makes curls a little bouncier. I also like the scent.</li>
    <li> The product did not make my curls pop at all. Just left my locks frizzy, as if I had no product on it. Also, it doesn&#x27;t help revitalize dry hair either. And I couldn&#x27;t return the product because it is an aerosol product! Grrrr. That part I don&#x27;t get since the product was sent to me in the first place!</li>
    <li> love this stuff, please never discontinue, I would be lost without it and my hair would be under a hat</li>
    <li> This product helps the curls come to life. I have  been using Curls Rock Booster for many years. TIGI should never stop producing this product.</li>
    <li> I like this spray for when I have to wake up really early or don&#x27;t feel like blowing my hair straight.  I wash my hair the night before, then just slightly wet it in the shower in the morning, scrunch while blow drying with a curl diffuser to the point where my hair is 80% dry.  For the final step, I flip my hair upside down and scrunch this product in all over, including ends and roots.  I think it looks nice for work and school with some definition of waves or curl instead of just limp, wavy, hair that has had obviously no effort made.  The cons are the product is expensive and getting harder to find in stores, hopefully it will keep being sold here.  I have extremely fine/thin hair and the product works for me.  Wont exactly curl your hair if you don&#x27;t have curls.  However, my hair is slightly wavy when it isn&#x27;t blow dried straight and this product makes it look beachy and put together.  I think it smells good and get compliments on the fragrance.  Tip: if you have really fine and thin hair like I do, spraying this in and scrunching before putting your hair up helps to secure the style.  If I don&#x27;t use this or hairspray, my hair slips out of clips and barrettes. Overall, I like it and have bought it for over 6 years.</li>
    <li> Use this to spray on my wet hair....seems to soften the curls.  I also use this on dry hair to put more definition to the curls.  This is a good product and a great price.  I received it quicker than I thought I would and was impressed with that.</li>
    <li> This is the best! With natural curly hair that can have a mind of its own. This will keep your curls looking great. But NOT make your hair crunchy (unless you put it on when your hair is wet)&lt;br /&gt;  I always let my hair air dry half way. Spay it on ,give it a quick scrunch &amp; then I&#x27;m done for the day.  No heavy build up EVER!</li>
    <li> it smells really great but it left my hair very limpy and I have thick hair so it was not expected.</li>
    <li> Works great for my fine wavy hair. I love the smell. I can wear my hair up for work and then take it down after my shift and it doesn&#x27;t leave a weird dent in my hair. Stuff&#x27;s the bomb.</li>
    <li> My wife says it is the only product that works for her curly hair. And I agree!  Will buy more as needed.</li>
    <li> It makes me look like I got dreadlocks. When it dries, it just looks like hair spray, like I went to a party last night and didn&#x27;t wash my hair the next day.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this curl booster anywhere locally so I tried amazon ! This is a great curl booster that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair oily or greasy ! It forms gorgeous curls that are soft and light! Love this product !</li>
    <li> My favorite lightweight curl product. Holds all day with no stiffness or oiliness. I use with catwalk root boost for fine wavy/curly hair</li>
    <li> Very helpful in bringing out the natural curl of my hair. Good price. Hair does not feel stiff, but soft</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without it . I fear they will not have it that&#x27;s why I buy 10 at a time</li>
    <li> Spray this on your sopping wet hair and follow with a pump of Tigi Catwalk Curls Rock Curl Amplifier, then blow-dry with a diffuser.  Clouds of soft, touchable curls!  I panic when I am running low on this product and try never to be without it!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite haur product !</li>
    <li> I have been using the Catwalk curl boosters for a couple years.  I am very satisfied with the results.  I have fine, curly, colored hair and in the heavy humidity of my town,  it would all turn to frizz if I didn&#x27;t use the curls rock booster after shampooing.  It promotes the curls, dampens the frizz, and the curls last from shampoo to shampoo.  I&#x27;m completely sold on these catwalk products for curly hair.  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and it is hard to find. If they do carry it, they will be out. I am so happy I found it here. It was shipped promptly. I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have very naturally curly hair and this is the only product I have found that allows me to wear curls instead of frizz. So glad it is still available on line.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t make this stuff in the stores any longer. I have a wholesale license, and this isn&#x27;t offered their any longer. The company stopped making the product. I wold usually pay $8/can at the beauty store, so paying $11 now isn&#x27;t that big of a deal. Especially when it&#x27;s the only thing that works for my hair. My hair is on the thicker side, naturally super wavy (with a little curl in the back) and this creates somewhat defined wave/curl without being crunchy. The second day after using this, I rewet my hair with a little water and give another quick application and it&#x27;s back to being wavy/curly without frizz. Love it.</li>
    <li> Great.  Have used it for years</li>
    <li> This is the only curl boosting product ill use. It creates incredible curls, waves &amp; volume without my hair being weighed down or sticky like most other curling products do. I swear by this stuff. Very difficult to find in my local stores so I&#x27;m happy Amazon sells this product. Works great!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. If ur hair has a hard time holding a curl then try this. It is o e of the only products that actually works with my hard to curl hair! I wish u could still buy this stuff in store.! I start with dry hair. Spray on a heat protectant.  Then spray hair with this catwalk curls rock spray, then curl ur hair. After ur done and the curls have cooled down spray with a regular hairspray.  Also the type of iron u use helps. Hot tools are excellent for hard to curl hair!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I can no longer find it in a store nearby, so I ordered 5 cans! I have fine, medium-short length, what I thought was wavy, hair, but with this product my hair has defined curls. It does not have conditioners that make my hair limp. It&#x27;s not sticky. Just spray on wet or dry hair, scrunch a little and air dry or blow dry with a diffuser. I use hair spray after spraying the curl booster onto the towel dried hair. After brushing out I lift using a vented brush and spray in place. Great curls that hold.</li>
    <li> If you want to boost your curly hair, this is the right product. Have used it now for 4 years and still love it.</li>
    <li> Works great on my curls, which tend to frizz. Also lightweight and not sticky afterward.  Can be used before or after drying.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that Amazon carries this product, it works really well with curly hair and is hard to find.  I like to use it after I blow dry my hair, calms the frizzies and keeps the curls formed nicely.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff too.  It&#x27;s easy to use, it smells really yummy, and it helps my weird half frizzy/half wavy hair actually develop (and hold) some good curl.  Tigi also sells a Curls Rock cream -- but I like this much better.</li>
    <li> This stuff works pretty good and it doesn&#x27;t make the curls feel stiff plus I love the smell!</li>
    <li> This curl booster is perfect for very fine textured curly hair like mine.  It doens&#x27;t make it crunchy and gives just enough hold to tame the frizz and curl.  Was very disappointed that the company decided to stop making it when they revamped their Catwalk Curl line.  Thank goodness I can still find it on Amazon. Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do when I can&#x27;t find it anywhere anymore.</li>
    <li> The Tigi Catwalk Curls Rock Booster, 7.7 Ounce is a product that I  have used for a long time and it works for me</li>
    <li> Great for naturally curly hair!</li>
    <li> Seems to put a little extra curl in my hair after it is dry.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anything other than touching up later in the day.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and have used it for years when I have perms.  I recently got a new perm after several years of not having them, so I dug this out of hiding and began using it again.  Nothing works like this for me to set my curls and revive them between shampoos.  I can sleep on my curls and wake up with most of the curls still intact.  It really helps my hair to last several days before the next wash and oddly enough it looks better and better with each day.  For me having a perm saves me having to do my hair so much.  I have neck issues and doing the back of my hair has been more and more difficult over the years.  This stuff saves me so much time and effort and frees me up to do other things (while still looking nice) rather than spending so much time on my head.  It holds and helps with body and adds a touch of shine too.  I bought 3 cans on Amazon because after reading the reviews, I am very worried this will be discontinued.  Then what do I do?</li>
    <li> Feels like regular hairspray.... It does tame the frizzies, but that&#x27;s because it sticks the hair together...again, you can accomplish this with regular hairspray..... I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and love it. TIGI are the only styling products I use in my curly hair.</li>
    <li> This hairspray has a pretty good hold without making your hair feel sticky or hard. The smell is nicer than most too.</li>
    <li> Really helps to give my roots a nice boost and lift! I don&#x27;t feel that is dries my hair out or anything... works great.</li>
    <li> Like mostly everyone else has mentioned, this curl booster is SO hard to find in stores --i was depressed when they stopped selling it. I am so happy i found it on Amazon--Go Amazon! I never knew. I ordered two --and hope that when i am ready to order more, that there is ample supply. Such a good product that I don&#x27;t know why TiGi would stop making it! I used it a few years ago until i could not find it anymore. I also used the Curl Amplifier --which was awesome, however, i found it not really working anymore...i hope to try it again with the curl booster --maybe it will work again. Regardless, the curl booster always worked great on my natural curly hair and i look forward to using it again.</li>
    <li> For my fine hair, this is the best curl enhancer I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> Great product, Good price. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> always a good product and hard to find in stores</li>
    <li> This is the only product I can find that turns my wavy hair into a neat curly look. I just spray it on my combed wet hair and scrunch. When my hair dries it is not crunchy, or greasy.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years. Really defines my naturally curly hair!</li>

I love How it gives my curls big bounce and volume, i mean lots of Volume  love it love it love it get a lot of compliments on my hair every time I use this Pruduct. the way I use it wash my hair blow dry my hair then I will spray on my roots and sculpt little bit of the spray and just let catwalk curl do its  job 👍👍👍👍👍👏👏👏👏👏thank god for this product I get so many good complements of my hair how nice and curly it looks</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping, item was exactly as described. Very happy thank you!!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Amazon is the only place I can find it!</li>
    <li> Use with Curls Rock Curly Hair Shampoo and never have frizz, just lovely natural curls.  My hair is fine and this does not weigh it down at all.  The only noticeable difference when I use it is the total lack of frizz even in NC HUMID summers.  Getting hard to find so I stock up when I do.</li>
    <li> I have not found a better product for curly hair!!!  Definitely will purchase this as a staple item for my hair!</li>
    <li> This product is the most effective one I&#x27;ve found in my 48 year search for controlling frizz.  I love it!</li>
    <li> It is the only product that makes my wife&#x27;s wavy hair curly. She just love it. She would recommend it to anyone who likes curly hair that lasts.</li>
    <li> This stuff is magic! It&#x27;s my favorite hair product of all time.</li>
    <li> Reviewing hair care products can be tricky, because everyone&#x27;s hair is different.  I&#x27;m a White woman and my hair very fine, but also halfway been straight and curly, with a lot of frizz.  So I need to decide each morning whether to curl it or straighten it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a lot of different curling products,  My favorite, of course, was discontinued by Redkin.  So I tried this.  What I like about this product is that it is not at all greasy and it comes out as a fine mist spray, very similar to hairspray.  Therefore, it is light, non-greasy, and does not weigh by hair down, which are essential features of a curling product.  I would say that if you are looking for these features, give it a try.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I wish they still sold it in stores.  I like having a spray product for curly hair that isn&#x27;t a gel.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 8 years.  My hair looks soft but the spray keeps it styled.  I have natural curly hair and this helps to keep the natural look and keeps it neat.</li>
    <li> I use this product in conjunction withTigi Catwalk Curls Rock Curl Amplifier (that&#x27;s a mouthful).  I get out of the shower and with very damp hair, I apply the amplifier, scrunch my hair and let it set...then if I want more poof and loser curls, I spray the booster to my hair.  It&#x27;s almost like it dampens it again, so this product is probably better used for it&#x27;s name...a boost...to reshape some lose curls and to give a little hold.  I have not used this alone or on wet hair without the amplifier, so I&#x27;m not sure how well it would work if applied alone.</li>
    <li> Keeps the curls in place and looking natural.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I have never found anything that feels as absent as this but looks great.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Can&#x27;t find it in any store anymore 😔</li>
    <li> I have been using this for my thin full hair of curl and waves of hair That I have, that is now very frizzy And I get individualized curls and much less frizzing HAPPY SHOPPING!</li>
    <li> I am having a bad hair life.  It&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s thin, it&#x27;s...yuck. But by some miracle I developed a little bit of wave after menopause and this product puts curls into my hair.  I occassionally get suckered into trying something else and I&#x27;m always regretful.  This is the only product that gives me results and it&#x27;s not sticky or heavy.  I second another reviewer that It&#x27;s difficult to find and I&#x27;m happy to be able to find it here.</li>
    <li> I love the Curls Rock line! I&#x27;ve used it for several years. I always make sure I have plenty of the Curl Amplifier, because it&#x27;s the best product in this line. As for the Curl Booster, I could take it or leave it. It leaves my hair a little weighted down and sticky, but it does a great job fighting frizz and redefining my curls as a sprayed-on touch-up in the afternoon or evening. I know these are a bit pricey, so if you are on a limited budget, I would buy only the Curl Amplifier. If you can afford both, then the Curl Booster be a good addition for you.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for this product everywhere.  Love it.  Sadly, TIGI has apparently discontinued production.</li>
    <li> Great product use every day.</li>
    <li> this stuff always works, but sometimes it dries my hair and creates a touch of frizz.</li>
    <li> I have a natural frizz and wave to my hair and have fine limp hair...this is the only product that gives me curl with control.</li>
    <li> I have used Tigi Catwalk Rock Booster for several years and really love its performance on my curls.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is this only site that I have found to purchase this online!  so, thanks for being there for me!!</li>
    <li> I love this so much!  Really enlivened my curls.</li>
    <li> I am a HUGE fan of the TIGI line in particular the curls rock line.I have been using them now for over 12 years and its the only thing that works in my mixed hair (black latina). I use this curl booster when my hair is dry. I flip my head over and spray towards the roots and it gives my lots of fine hair curls a major boost. I love defined curls with volume. It smells great and when I use it I always get compliments.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it gives me curls that last, rejeuvenate with a spritz of water and light scrunching, and that don&#x27;t crunch. Soft, natural curls and even better with the curling iron.</li>
    <li> Product does what is says.  Curls rock.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle last about a month.  All she has to do is brush her hair, spray and the curls last all day.  Sweet.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! I&#x27;ve been using it for years, my natural curly hair loves it! Can only get it through you at a great price ! Please continue to carry it! ; )</li>
    <li> The only product I&#x27;ve found that tames the curls and still feels soft and not stiff</li>
    <li> My favorite go to product. Boosts curl and tames frizz. Recommend</li>
    <li> This works well with Curls Rock Amplifier to boost and keep my curls looking good all day!</li>
    <li> I cannot find this anywhere but on Amazon. I have natural curl and have issues with frizz. This is great and keeps my curls separated.The package came as described in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Perfect for curly hair. Keeps the frizz away. Have used this product for more than 10 years. I feel I must hoard this item in fear they&#x27;ll stop making it.</li>
    <li> This is more like a hairspray. It is very sticky and makes my curls crunchy.Good for a rainy day when you need product, but don&#x27;t want to waste your good stuff in your hair. Drys my hair out too. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Made my hair stiff but kept some of the curl in I guess. I&#x27;m new to this curl thing .i may not be using it correctly</li>
