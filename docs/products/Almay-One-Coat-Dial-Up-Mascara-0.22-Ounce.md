      <li>Love this mascara.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve owned better.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the most important thing.</li>
      <li>and it works fine.</li>
      <li>The seller was fully honest and fast delivery-</li>
      <li>This is by far the best mascara that I have used in a long time.</li>
      <li>Whether true or not I do not know</li>
      <li>100% true to description and quality.  </li>
      <li>I am glad I didn&#x27;t, it works very well, no clumps and really thickens my lashes.</li>
      <li>The brush is small plastic nubs to the maybelline great lashes brush.</li>
      <li>I like the nice long lashes this gives me but a bit clumpy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using mostly the maybelline great lashes (green and pink) mascara for years</li>
      <li>It did not clump at all when I first got it.</li>
      <li>I first purchased it when it was on sale and the Beauty Consultant at Walgreens had a 3.00 off coupon</li>
      <li>Also the dial doesn&#x27;t do much, except just allows extra mascara to be added onto the brush, so more clumps.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t recommend it to the normal buyer who wants FULL, lengthening lashes.   </li>
      <li>My absolute fave....</li>
      <li>it really coats and lengthens my lashes.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do much for making your eyelash look fuller.</li>
      <li>Really adhers to lashes</li>
      <li>This Almay mascara is much better than other&#x27;s I have tried (Maybelline, Clinique).</li>
      <li>on nice and thick with the first swoop of the brush.</li>
      <li>I am an older woman and my lashes have gotten thinner.</li>
      <li>I bought this as a BOGO at my local CVS and when I went back for more...</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I am very very impressed and very very sad that I could not purchase it anywhere locally, only found it here!!!</li>
      <li>The mascara must of been old because it dried out very quickly.</li>
      <li>The only thing that would make this mascara better is if it was waterproof and lasted a little longer without getting clumpy.</li>
      <li>I am a professional and have been in cosmetics for years, so when my 13 year old young cousin shows up with this mascara, I figured I would give it a shot.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really use the dial up feature until the lowest setting doesn&#x27;t give me enough, then I up it a bit.  </li>
      <li>i recommend makes you look ur very big eyelashes,the delivery is so fast.</li>
      <li>It just doesn&#x27;t really make a big difference with clicking on the three &amp;#34;fullness&amp;#34; options.  </li>
      <li>My lashes look very long and black, and it washes off fairly easily.</li>
      <li>I bought this because my previous one was finally running out after a full year</li>
      <li>Eventually, I tried to put a few drops of hot water directly in the tube and thoroughly shake it.</li>
      <li>Just a big mess that wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
      <li>It really is one coat first off, but I&#x27;ll admit, I only found use for the third one as all I&#x27;m always looking for is thick lashes, which it did a decent job at, but the trick to the different types is how tight the inside was at taking off the mascara on the tube.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I do a lot of research on makeup.  I am a professional and have been in cosmetics for years, so when my 13 year old young cousin shows up with this mascara, I figured I would give it a shot.  This is the best I have ever tried and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it, if I could submit a picture with this...I would.  It&#x27;s amazing!!!  I am very very impressed and very very sad that I could not purchase it anywhere locally, only found it here!!!</li>
    <li> It really is one coat first off, but I&#x27;ll admit, I only found use for the third one as all I&#x27;m always looking for is thick lashes, which it did a decent job at, but the trick to the different types is how tight the inside was at taking off the mascara on the tube. It&#x27;s the same mascara, just the different holes to take the wand out. I don&#x27;t know about you, but I felt like I was tricked into that one.</li>
    <li> This is easily as good as $20+ mascaras. I don&#x27;t give a hoot about the dial thing, I leave it on 3 (cleans the most mascara off) and the results are excellent. My lashes look very long and black, and it washes off fairly easily.</li>
    <li> Love it. Makes my lashes look fake! Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever had, and I was an urban decay big fattie junkie for a while, then their skyscraper mascara, and then I switched to Benefit&#x27;s bad gal. This beats them all! And the price can&#x27;t be beat! AND...NO ITCHY EYES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I knew how to upload a pic on here...</li>
    <li> I like the nice long lashes this gives me but a bit clumpy. I leave it on dial 1 because either 2 or 3, they all work the same. Makes my eyelashes long but not full. I&#x27;ve owned better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using mostly the maybelline great lashes (green and pink) mascara for years and it works fine. I decided to change it up. The almay mascara is very wet when first applied, then it dries slower than the usual mascara does. It also only lengthens....Doesn&#x27;t really do much for making your eyelash look fuller. Also the dial doesn&#x27;t do much, except just allows extra mascara to be added onto the brush, so more clumps. The brush is small plastic nubs to the maybelline great lashes brush. I usually leave the dial on 1.5 and it works alright. Don&#x27;t recommend it to the normal buyer who wants FULL, lengthening lashes.   But if you&#x27;re fine with just lengthening lashes, then beware the clumps!</li>
    <li> I am on my second container of this mascara. I first purchased it when it was on sale and the Beauty Consultant at Walgreens had a 3.00 off coupon.. I couldn&#x27;t pass up the deal. I am glad I didn&#x27;t, it works very well, no clumps and really thickens my lashes.</li>
    <li> This Almay mascara is much better than other&#x27;s I have tried (Maybelline, Clinique). I have allergy and dryness issues with my eyes, and this doesn&#x27;t make them itchy. It did not clump at all when I first got it. After a year, I think maybe it&#x27;s age is making it clump a little. I find it helps to swirl the wand around to mix before you pull it out.</li>
    <li> The brush in this mascara is great. It separates the lashes and finds small ones you can&#x27;t even see. I use two mascaras because I can&#x27;t always find this one. I bought four, just for the brush.</li>
    <li> The mascara must of been old because it dried out very quickly. I believe it is a discontinued product. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my previous one was finally running out after a full year (I don&#x27;t wear mascara every day).  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else anymore.  It goes on great and doesn&#x27;t irritate.  I don&#x27;t really use the dial up feature until the lowest setting doesn&#x27;t give me enough, then I up it a bit.  This way it lasts a long time.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This makes your lashes long, noticeable and does not clump.  Singles them out nicely.  It also lasts long and does not get smelly like some others if kept for a while. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> 100% true to description and quality.  It just doesn&#x27;t really make a big difference with clicking on the three &amp;#34;fullness&amp;#34; options.  The seller was fully honest and fast delivery- doesn&#x27;t flake or itch my eyes.  But THIS Almay product isn&#x27;t application variant with the clicks.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best mascara that I have used in a long time. I am an older woman and my lashes have gotten thinner. This mascara makes them look thicker without being &amp;#34;clumpy.&amp;#34; I have tried the newer Almay mascara and it just do the job that this one does. I am unable to find it in the stores. Whether true or not I do not know but I have been told that the One Coat Dial Up Mascara has been discontinued.  I hope that is not correct.</li>
    <li> I have been using Almay Thickening Mascara for years.  Decided to try this for a change. Was hoping for thick, lush eyelashes. It&#x27;s mascara. No irritation, no burning eyes. That&#x27;s the most important thing.</li>
    <li> this mascara is the ultimate! i recommend makes you look ur very big eyelashes,the delivery is so fast.</li>
    <li> The comb is perfect, barely clumps, the product does not irritate me.</li>
    <li> Great buy. Love this mascara</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good product but if u have oily skin after about 4 hours it starts to run</li>
    <li> My absolute fave....it really coats and lengthens my lashes.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara. Really adhers to lashes</li>
    <li> She complained that it wouldn&#x27;t come out, and sure enough, it was dried up. Not even boiling it worked. Eventually, I tried to put a few drops of hot water directly in the tube and thoroughly shake it. That worked for a while. Just a big mess that wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a great mascara.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on nice and thick with the first swoop of the brush. No having to go over and over and over to get color on your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t find in the stores anymore. Every time I find something good its taken off the market.</li>
    <li> This product i fell in love with when i first bought this at ulta beauty store,but my friend bought this off amazon and the quality was just as good! I love the idea of the dial up and it actually works... which is a plus! The only thing that would make this mascara better is if it was waterproof and lasted a little longer without getting clumpy. But for the price this is a great buy. This is my all time favorite mascara and i will be sure to buy this product again! I really recommend this product to EVERYONE who likes to save money but also have a great product!</li>
    <li> I have allergies and this product does not bother my eyes.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this mascara!!  I bought this as a BOGO at my local CVS and when I went back for more...they discontinued it.  So glad I was able to find on Amazon at a really good price.  I like being able to select the amount you want to apply.  Usually 1.5 for daytime, then up to 3 for dramatic evening looks.  No clumps, no flakes and washes off with any cleanser.</li>
    <li> Best mascara ever. Love the wand.</li>
