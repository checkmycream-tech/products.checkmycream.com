      <li>This has the best scent, the best feel, it comes clean off of my hands perfectly...</li>
      <li>Works great..</li>

      <li>Good packaging, works well.</li>
      <li>If you cannot travel this would be a good product to buy though</li>
      <li>Good product at a good price.</li>
      <li>I am a fan of Softsoap products, so this satisfied both of us!</li>
      <li>great price and quick delivery</li>
      <li>So now I love Amazon even more!</li>
      <li>Very nice size refill very clean smelling and gets hands clean.</li>
      <li>Smells great and moisturizes very well.</li>
      <li>For most of my life I was old-school when it came to soap.</li>
      <li>And will have to make a trip to the shop to buy more.</li>
      <li>This does not; its consistency is more like water.</li>
      <li>I have always used Amazon for so many years, but now I don&#x27;t have to bother friends or my daughter to pick up things I need.</li>
      <li>I love this soap, and ordered two refills -</li>
      <li>I love this refill for hand soap.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great as far as antibacterial soaps go!  </li>
      <li>I promptly went and filled all of my dispensers to the top with what had been delivered.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, good soap refill.</li>
      <li>The product itself is fine, but the shipping was a disaster.</li>
      <li>My absolute FAVORITE soap EVER!</li>
      <li>this is great soap although i did find a refill afterwards at a store that was bigger and cheaper.</li>
      <li>This soap is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Three of my 5 rare diseases have said to be sure my hand soap is antibacterial.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thrilled they have one of my main diseases I can contribute to.</li>
      <li>It used to leave my hands feeling clean.</li>
      <li>I like the clean feel and smell fo the soap</li>
      <li>This is good soap; one star off simply because its not for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
      <li>I keep my pump on by the bathroom sink and the kids use it up so quickly</li>
      <li>Well, as you can see, I have already come back for more!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t buy any other kind.</li>
      <li>This is my favourite kind of liquid soap as most of them dry my hands or smell unpleasant, but the one advertised is great.</li>
      <li>And it certainly has some advantages.</li>
      <li>But they really hit the jackpot with the &amp;#34;smile.</li>
      <li>(Can&#x27;t drive, which is why I order so much stuff from Amazon).</li>
      <li>In any event, thicker does not mean cleaner.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s both economical &amp; efficient instead of buying a bunch of cheaper smaller soap bottles for each sink.</li>
      <li>Very soft on hands.</li>
      <li>And a brand such as SoftSoap has antibacterial properties and is gentle on the hands.</li>
      <li>Always trusted Soft Soap.</li>
      <li>I finally became persuaded that liquid hand soap was just as reasonably cost-wise as is bar soap.</li>
      <li>I preferred the old formula.</li>
      <li>This larger size and some of the other colors/&amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; by this company (but not all of them) are also anti-bacterial - which I think is important.  </li>
      <li>This size (32 oz.) is not too heavy or bulky to hold &amp; pour; its cap makes it easy to refill any of my smaller soap bottles that I&#x27;ve had for years now.</li>
      <li>Then, after getting enough of those for every sink in the house, I began buying the larger refills, since they are a real bargain.</li>
      <li>Ordered the antibacterial soft soap, and was given a bottle of regular lathering soft soap.  </li>
      <li>The soap I got was the exact same color and similar label (which fooled me - and presumably the person who packed it too) but was not the same soap.</li>
      <li>The result is per-ounce prices that vary wildly; at the moment some are double others.</li>
      <li>Great refill, less expensive here on Amazon then big box stores.</li>
      <li>At first I bought the soap in the little dispensers.</li>
      <li>Not enough was lost to justify returning the item, but it was not pleasant to have to clean up.</li>

<li> (No more soap dishes with half an inch of water in them slowly dissolving the soap.)</li>
<li> Lots of soap I don&#x27;t like and too late to try and return.</li>
<li> Thin and watery.</li>
<li> WARNING: very small bottle!</li>
<li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t get what was advertised.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s watered down,  does not lather, and smells terrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Some liquid soaps have a gelatinous texture. This does not; its consistency is more like water. If you prefer the denser soaps then avoid this. But if dense soaps clog your soap dispensers and build up at the end of the spout, as they do with mine, this is the stuff to use. I suspect that not clogging dispensers is part of the point of this product, so that its easier to use in industrial and commercial environments. In any event, thicker does not mean cleaner. This is good soap; one star off simply because its not for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that this soap comes in various sizes of both consumer and commercial packing from various sellers. The result is per-ounce prices that vary wildly; at the moment some are double others. So search carefully and check the &amp;#34;consumers also bought&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;consumers also viewed&amp;#34; lists that Amazon shows you.</li>
    <li> My husband wanted a soap that had &amp;#34;antibacterial&amp;#34; in its description! So he is very happy with this one. I am a fan of Softsoap products, so this satisfied both of us! Good product!</li>
    <li> Thin and watery. Will not lather. Money wasted.</li>
    <li> This soap is fantastic.  Very soft on hands. Smells great and moisturizes very well. I keep my pump on by the bathroom sink and the kids use it up so quickly, I need the refill bottle.</li>
    <li> Great refill, less expensive here on Amazon then big box stores.</li>
    <li> I love this soap, and ordered two refills - one was this one, and the other was the lavender and chamomile refill. They are great products, but the packing that they were shipped in was terrible. Both bottles were crushed and leaking a bit when I got them. Amazon, please put these in plastic bags and box them up better!!</li>
    <li> Do not buy. This is NOT softsoap antibacterial hand soap. It&#x27;s watered down,  does not lather, and smells terrible.</li>
    <li> They changed the formula in the last year or two. It used to leave my hands feeling clean. Now they feel a bit too moisturized. I preferred the old formula.</li>
    <li> I love this refill for hand soap.  This size (32 oz.) is not too heavy or bulky to hold &amp; pour; its cap makes it easy to refill any of my smaller soap bottles that I&#x27;ve had for years now. And it&#x27;s both economical &amp; efficient instead of buying a bunch of cheaper smaller soap bottles for each sink.This larger size and some of the other colors/&amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; by this company (but not all of them) are also anti-bacterial - which I think is important.  The refill last for several months.</li>
    <li> this is great soap although i did find a refill afterwards at a store that was bigger and cheaper. If you cannot travel this would be a good product to buy though</li>
    <li> No silver seal water down</li>
    <li> I need an antibacterial for a skin condition.  This product does the job and has a pleasing fragrance.</li>
    <li> For most of my life I was old-school when it came to soap. I insisted on having a bar of Ivory in every bathroom and at the kitchen sink. I finally became persuaded that liquid hand soap was just as reasonably cost-wise as is bar soap. And it certainly has some advantages. It&#x27;s definitely less messy than is bar soap. (No more soap dishes with half an inch of water in them slowly dissolving the soap.) And a brand such as SoftSoap has antibacterial properties and is gentle on the hands. At first I bought the soap in the little dispensers. Then, after getting enough of those for every sink in the house, I began buying the larger refills, since they are a real bargain.</li>
    <li> Works great..I like the clean feel and smell fo the soap</li>
    <li> My absolute FAVORITE soap EVER! I don&#x27;t buy any other kind. This has the best scent, the best feel, it comes clean off of my hands perfectly...I have no complaints whatsoever except for one...I can&#x27;t keep it in stock!</li>
    <li> I am disabled and bedridden now. I have always used Amazon for so many years, but now I don&#x27;t have to bother friends or my daughter to pick up things I need. So now I love Amazon even more! But they really hit the jackpot with the &amp;#34;smile.Amazon.com&amp;#34; program. I&#x27;m thrilled they have one of my main diseases I can contribute to. And then post it on Facebook! Three of my 5 rare diseases have said to be sure my hand soap is antibacterial. This is my 2nd bottle I&#x27;ve ordered now on Amazon. It&#x27;s great as far as antibacterial soaps go!  The description Amazon uses is the best way to describe this! My hands are much softer &amp; this has a very faint smell if you&#x27;re like me &amp; has a nose that is sensitive to odors. Well, as you can see, I have already come back for more! (And I&#x27;ve tried almost every one out there!!)</li>
    <li> Very nice size refill very clean smelling and gets hands clean. Always trusted Soft Soap. The 1 gallon refills two months.</li>
    <li> Walmart has this for $ 4.88 and LARGER size of 56oz.  This is a ripp off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.walmart.com/ip/Softsoap-Crisp-Clean-Antibacterial-Hand-Soap-with-Moisturizers-Refill-56-fl-oz/23752131</li>
    <li> Ordered the antibacterial soft soap, and was given a bottle of regular lathering soft soap.  Same size, same color, even the same shape of the bottle, different label, different product inside.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle I received said \\&quot;Washes away bacteria\\&quot;, not \\&quot;Antibacterial\\&quot; like it should have.  The one I received was clearly the wrong stuff.</li>
    <li> Use at office.. Good product at a good price. A++</li>
    <li> great price and quick delivery</li>
    <li> Using this soap will help keep you well!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, good soap refill.</li>
    <li> This is my favourite kind of liquid soap as most of them dry my hands or smell unpleasant, but the one advertised is great. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t get what was advertised. The soap I got was the exact same color and similar label (which fooled me - and presumably the person who packed it too) but was not the same soap. Unfortunately a couple of my soap dispensers had almost run out when this was delivered, and others were only part full, so (stupidly assuming I had been delivered what I had ordered) I promptly went and filled all of my dispensers to the top with what had been delivered. I first wondered what was wrong when my hands were dry and itchy after using the soap, and then noticed that the soap in the dispensers had kind of curdled and gone weird looking. Then I checked the label properly. Terrific. Lots of soap I don&#x27;t like and too late to try and return. Will definitely not order again from here again. And will have to make a trip to the shop to buy more. (Can&#x27;t drive, which is why I order so much stuff from Amazon). Big thumbs down.</li>
    <li> WARNING: very small bottle! Picture misleading!</li>
    <li> Good packaging, works well.</li>
    <li> The product itself is fine, but the shipping was a disaster. The bottle&#x27;s screw-top lid came loose. I&#x27;m grateful it was in a bag, but the bag&#x27;s seal also opened up enough for some soap to leak out. In short, there was soap all over everything. Not enough was lost to justify returning the item, but it was not pleasant to have to clean up.</li>
