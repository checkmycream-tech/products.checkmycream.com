<li> I will either wait to see if the price comes down or I will try and find a representative and see what they are charging.</li>
<li> The bottle is well designed so you can squeeze out cleanser with little waste.</li>
<li> I HATE the new Mary Kay Timewise line -- I&#x27;ve tried two different cleansers (since I can&#x27;t get this fresh anymore) -- and they dry out my skin terribly.  </li>
<li> Both of these products have worked well for me over the past 20 years.</li>
<li> It has served me well for approximately 16 years.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m so sad that Mary Kay get this product out of market.</li>
<li> I hate to see it go.</li>

    <li> I love this cleanser! It is so gentle on your skin and takes care of all the makeup pretty easily. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a decade and wouldn&#x27;t change it to anything else. I would recommend it to those with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It gently yet totally takes away all traces of make-up, leaving my face feeling so clean.</li>
    <li> Mary Kay has discontinued most of their original line of face care products, including this one. I am glad that I was able to find this on Amazon. I will look for it again when I need more. I have used this product for over 30 years and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my face.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with this product.  I went to buy more and the price has doubled.  I won&#x27;t pay that price.  I will either wait to see if the price comes down or I will try and find a representative and see what they are charging.</li>

    <li> Good cleanser. It removes my makeup and leaves a good feeling on my skin even before I apply the freshener.</li>
    <li> This is undoubtedly the absolutely best cleanser I have ever used.  However, it&#x27;s my understanding that this item has been discontinued from Mary Kay&#x27;s line.  Therefore, if you want to purchase it, you can only get it while supplies last.  It has served me well for approximately 16 years.  I hate to see it go.</li>
    <li> Very good and meet my expectation.</li>
    <li> This item I use all the time.  My consultant was out, actually this&#x27;s item is no longer being made and I really love iit so when I seen this item on amazon I was happy to order it, I know eventually I will not be able to get it at all so I am trying to get it as much as I can</li>
    <li> Mary Kay is one of the best cleansers I have ever used.  This was a great price and I now have a good supply.</li>
    <li> Why did Mary K stop making this formula 2 stuff?  My wife says it&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> The creamy cleanser makes my skin look and feel beautiful.</li>
    <li> this cleanser doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling tight and yet it removes makeup very well. The bottle is well designed so you can squeeze out cleanser with little waste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to buy it I don&#x27;t think.  This product must be very old - on top of that this person is charging double what it used to cost.  I HATE the new Mary Kay Timewise line -- I&#x27;ve tried two different cleansers (since I can&#x27;t get this fresh anymore) -- and they dry out my skin terribly.  Its not right that in the morning when I am getting ready to cleanse that I DREAD doing it and it bothers me every day and night that I can&#x27;t get Creamy Cleanser 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of that -- within two weeks or less of using the Timewise, I noticed huge wrinkles that I never had before!!!  Good job, Mary Kay -- thanks a BUNCH.</li>
    <li> Good product. I wish it was not discontinued.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser  to take off my makeup every night it is light and leaves your face clean and not greasy.  It also last a long time because a little goes a long way.</li>
