      <li>The microbial silver it is impregnated with, along with its moisture wicking ability seems to be what makes it so good.  </li>

      <li>this stuff is amazing.  </li>

      <li>Thanks Mrs Jean H Fly</li>
      <li>washable; so, product can be used more than once.  </li>
      <li>I would give it more stars if I could.</li>
      <li>I am so pleased with this material I even brought it to the nursing home and put in on him myself.</li>
      <li>We have a patient with many wounds.</li>
      <li>I am the primary caretaker for my mother.</li>
      <li>I cannot stress enough how great this is and</li>
      <li>I was overjoyed to find it available to me without a prescription.  </li>
      <li>When I developed a lovely wound myself, I was thrilled to see I could purchase this on amazon.  </li>
      <li>Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it - trust me!</li>
      <li>She has Parkinson&#x27;s and isn&#x27;t able to move very well and sits the majority of the day.</li>
      <li>Excellent product that help heal a serious problem</li>
      <li>When I contacted the company, they quickly send out another package.  </li>
      <li>I use Colloidal Silver as a natural antibiotic at home all the time for preventing colds and treating infections with great success, so I was all for any product containing natural silver.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, you can use a piece of this &#x27;fabric&#x27; a couple of times (cannot wash &amp; use repeatedly), cut to size &amp; will last quite some</li>
      <li>Well worth the price</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve already been using it for several years via the local hospital and it works great.  </li>
      <li>First use of this product was in the hospital.</li>
      <li>This was first given to me at the hospital for a skin infection</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
      <li>Treatment started on Thursday, and by Monday, almost all of the large, raw patches of skin had fresh, clean, healthy skin growing, and the infection was gone (and the horrid odor that goes with it,</li>
      <li>It works, as long as you keep on top of it.  </li>
      <li>I think anyone who does dressing changes in large areas should give it a try.</li>
      <li>Really helps prevent heat / skin infections and rashes.</li>
      <li>Very convenient to order it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very health advance.  </li>
      <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
      <li>just really not...doesn&#x27;t stay in place....</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Of course regular care is still needed to keep the area clean.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The antimicrobial element of silver was new to me but boy does it work!</li>
      <li>maybe for people who aren&#x27;t very active it would be better.</li>
      <li>If you have the need for this product, I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>,  the first package mysteriously disappeared in the mail.  </li>
      <li>later of using a small strip of this and my own wound was dramatically healed.  </li>
      <li>These clear things up in record time .</li>
      <li>Finally a product that really works .</li>
      <li>Wish you could get it through local pharmacy and that it didn&#x27;t cost as much.  </li>
      <li>and it was completely gone.  </li>
      <li>within a couple of days of using this product it clears up completely</li>
      <li>It keeps the area dry, clean and germs at a minimum, allowing the area to heal much faster than conventional methods.</li>
      <li>My only hesitation is that it is a little pricey when there are many medical expenses.</li>
      <li>These sheets have cleared up the problem much faster &amp; without the mess.</li>
      <li>I put this on a raw, opened, blistered area (4&amp;#34; x .5&amp;#34;) on my mom that TCU nurses had been using Nystatin on.</li>

<li> This is a fantastic product, I used it on my husband while he was sick, and it cleared up the problems right away.</li>
<li> I am a retired nurse and had used inter dry on patients.</li>
<li> If you have a wound that needs to stay dry put this on it before you cover it.  </li>
<li> It pulls all the moisture away from your wound and helps it stay dry and heal faster.</li>
<li> It was not healing with the cream applications (and their vigorous rubbing/scrubbing), but with the Inter Dry, it was healed without all the fuss in about two weeks.</li>
<li> i liked the idea but. :(</li>
<li> One of the CNAs recommended the InterDry and said they had some left from a previous resident that they could use for Mom.  </li>
<li> They are expensive but worth it.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t let these skin fold issues become serious enough to require medical intervention</li>
<li> Because she is \\&quot;chubby\\&quot; , she has a problem with sweating which leads to red &amp; raw skin in her fat folds.  </li>
<li> It is expensive, but after researching it a bit, my husband and I decided to make the investment and add it to our first aid supplies at home.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
<li> It&#x27;s expensive but it really helps.</li>
<li> The material is soft and non irritating</li>
<li> This product  may seem expensive, but it is like a miracle for those who need to keep inner skin dry.</li>
<li> I may have to leave a strip in the fold so it can breathe, but for now, have been cutting the strip into a smaller size and only applying when a rash appears.</li>
<li> I dont use this everyday but for wicking away moisture in close places you cant find anything</li>
<li> The only thing is it is overly expensive if you have to use any amount of it</li>
<li> I have used in the past from a drs office.</li>
<li> By then it was too late for the antifungal cream - her skin was badly broken down and infection had started.</li>
<li> I would recommend this product to anyone with skin folds that trap heat and moisture, creating dangerous and painful red marks (such as underneath the breasts and any fatty tissue like the bottom of the waistline).  </li>
<li> However, my mother was hospitalized and then placed in a nursing home for physical therapy after a bad fall, and during the transfer from the hospital to the nursing home, the skin fold treatment was not addressed, until I realized it wasn&#x27;t being handled, and brought it to the nurse&#x27;s attention at the nursing home.  </li>
<li> My mom is disabled and gets bad pressure sores.</li>
<li> It takes away all the dampness that forms in an ill patient.  </li>
<li> This stuff is expensive but it works.</li>
<li> As a nurse, I&#x27;ve used this in an ICU environment for patients with wounds that were difficult to heal and have seen it work wonders.  </li>
<li> I have excess skin from a combination of weight loss after surgery and cancer and if I don&#x27;t use this product my skin suffers</li>

    <li> Life saver if you have a shin fold problem.</li>
    <li> This product  may seem expensive, but it is like a miracle for those who need to keep inner skin dry. I was told about it from the hospital while my husband was there &amp; am so happy they did. It helped keep many of the skin problems under better control. Honestly, you can use a piece of this &#x27;fabric&#x27; a couple of times (cannot wash &amp; use repeatedly), cut to size &amp; will last quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;If you or someone you are taking care of has problems in the folds of the skin, this product is a miracle.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST for skin fold irritation and skin breakdown.  I care for my elderly mother in our home, and we were using a home remedy recommended by a nurse - antifungal cream and white handkerchiefs tucked into the skin folds to prevent the skin-on-skin contact that causes moisture buildup, and thus, the bacteria buildup as well.  It works, as long as you keep on top of it.  However, my mother was hospitalized and then placed in a nursing home for physical therapy after a bad fall, and during the transfer from the hospital to the nursing home, the skin fold treatment was not addressed, until I realized it wasn&#x27;t being handled, and brought it to the nurse&#x27;s attention at the nursing home.  By then it was too late for the antifungal cream - her skin was badly broken down and infection had started. One of the CNAs recommended the InterDry and said they had some left from a previous resident that they could use for Mom.  I use Colloidal Silver as a natural antibiotic at home all the time for preventing colds and treating infections with great success, so I was all for any product containing natural silver.  Treatment started on Thursday, and by Monday, almost all of the large, raw patches of skin had fresh, clean, healthy skin growing, and the infection was gone (and the horrid odor that goes with it, thank goodness).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t purchased this item on Amazon yet (but plan to) - but wanted to share our experience.  This is the BEST solution I have found yet for the skin fold issues that many people face.  Don&#x27;t let these skin fold issues become serious enough to require medical intervention - InterDry can solve the problem at home!  Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it - trust me!</li>
    <li> Really helps prevent heat / skin infections and rashes. A very comfortable, breathable fabric that worked well for me. Nurses told me about it while I was in the hospital, and so glad they did!</li>
    <li> I have used in the past from a drs office. Finding it on amazon has saved me lots of $$$$.  If you have the need for this product, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was given strips of this material by a doctor treating me for an skin infection caused by microbes.  It worked wonders.  I was overjoyed to find it available to me without a prescription.  I dont use this everyday but for wicking away moisture in close places you cant find anything better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The antimicrobial element of silver was new to me but boy does it work!</li>
    <li> Finally a product that really works . I am the primary caretaker for my mother. She has many ailments and this has been a godsend. She has Parkinson&#x27;s and isn&#x27;t able to move very well and sits the majority of the day. Because she is \\&quot;chubby\\&quot; , she has a problem with sweating which leads to red &amp; raw skin in her fat folds.  We had been using a anti fungal powder from Medline which is great but sometimes it would cake from the heat. These sheets have cleared up the problem much faster &amp; without the mess. We will be buying this product again &amp; again in the future. I would give it more stars if I could.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. My mom uses this and it prevents  skin friction, cleared up existing problem areas. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product, I used it on my husband while he was sick, and it cleared up the problems right away. Of course regular care is still needed to keep the area clean. I am so pleased with this material I even brought it to the nursing home and put in on him myself. A nurse from &amp;#34;wound care &amp;#34; dept. and wanted the information of how she could get this product for her department. Thanks Mrs Jean H Fly</li>
    <li> Product seems to work well. Very convenient to order it.  My only hesitation is that it is a little pricey when there are many medical expenses.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very health advance.  It does what it claims.</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> This was first given to me at the hospital for a skin infection my mother was being treated for.  The nursing staff ALL  said the product was very good and I really liked the fact that it could treat the infection without adding another prescription medicine to her regimen. The microbial silver it is impregnated with, along with its moisture wicking ability seems to be what makes it so good.

When I contacted the company, they quickly send out another package.  So, kudos to the company for handling a customer problem so well.</li>
    <li> wonderful stuff but veryexpensive</li>
    <li> Great product! Always arrives in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> it works very well, I would rate this a perfect 5.  If you have any type of skin disorder-- this is the product you need.  Wish you could get it through local pharmacy and that it didn&#x27;t cost as much.  but it works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great product</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work whatsoever.</li>
    <li> This coated fabric works miracles. I put this on a raw, opened, blistered area (4&amp;#34; x .5&amp;#34;) on my mom that TCU nurses had been using Nystatin on. It was not healing with the cream applications (and their vigorous rubbing/scrubbing), but with the Inter Dry, it was healed without all the fuss in about two weeks. It is amazing stuff. I may have to leave a strip in the fold so it can breathe, but for now, have been cutting the strip into a smaller size and only applying when a rash appears. It then takes a day or two of the treated cloth for her to heal.</li>
    <li> My mother in law uses this in the folds of her skin to avoid infection and skin breakdown.  It&#x27;s expensive but it really helps.</li>
    <li> First use of this product was in the hospital. It does a wonderful job wicking moisture. Well worth the price</li>
    <li> just really not...doesn&#x27;t stay in place....maybe for people who aren&#x27;t very active it would be better. i liked the idea but. :(</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to anyone suffering from an ‘itchy’ rash.  Great for under breasts and tummy wrinkle.  Helps alleviate itching and burning.  washable; so, product can be used more than once.  It has been a “lifesaver” for me!  The material is soft and non irritating</li>
    <li> If you have a wound that needs to stay dry put this on it before you cover it.  It pulls all the moisture away from your wound and helps it stay dry and heal faster.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve already been using it for several years via the local hospital and it works great.  I would recommend this product to anyone with skin folds that trap heat and moisture, creating dangerous and painful red marks (such as underneath the breasts and any fatty tissue like the bottom of the waistline).  It keeps the area dry, clean and germs at a minimum, allowing the area to heal much faster than conventional methods.</li>
    <li> We have a patient with many wounds. You get a lot in one box and it&#x27;s a really good product. I think anyone who does dressing changes in large areas should give it a try.</li>
    <li> Excellent product that help heal a serious problem</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.  I learned about it when I was in the hospital &amp; was told only hospitals could get it &amp; low &amp; behold I found it on Amazon.com.  The only thing is it is overly expensive if you have to use any amount of it regularly.&lt;br /&gt;Karen Ruprecht</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing.  It takes away all the dampness that forms in an ill patient.  My mom is a diabetic and get severe rashes in her crevices.  within a couple of days of using this product it clears up completely</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff!  As a nurse, I&#x27;ve used this in an ICU environment for patients with wounds that were difficult to heal and have seen it work wonders.  When I developed a lovely wound myself, I was thrilled to see I could purchase this on amazon.  One 12 hour shift (of working with it on) later of using a small strip of this and my own wound was dramatically healed.  One week of using it and it was completely gone.  Amazing.  I cannot stress enough how great this is and how well it works.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing ever. My mom is disabled and gets bad pressure sores. These clear things up in record time . They are expensive but worth it. I keep them always on hand .</li>
    <li> This stuff is expensive but it works. I have excess skin from a combination of weight loss after surgery and cancer and if I don&#x27;t use this product my skin suffers</li>
    <li> I am a retired nurse and had used inter dry on patients. I was so amazed at how well it works i bought some for me. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
