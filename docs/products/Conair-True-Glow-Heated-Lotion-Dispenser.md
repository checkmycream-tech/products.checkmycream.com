      <li>The directions tell you to turn it on, let the lotion warm up, then turn it off.  </li>
      <li>The lotion is spa warm in 90 seconds.  </li>
      <li>I will say, though, that it made the lotion a nice temperature</li>
      <li>it says (buzz), dispenses warm (buzz) lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Warm lotion in the winter time.</li>
      <li>you have to press the express button 4 or 5 times before it&#x27;s warm ....</li>
      <li>Like the idea but does get warm and stay warm</li>
      <li>so I wish it could warm thicker lotion</li>
      <li>Now I put the lotion in, and within 2 minutes, its nice and warm.</li>
      <li>I need a lot of lotion to fill it but does work nicely</li>
      <li>I flip it on to warm up before I head into the shower then flip it off again when I get out.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so nice to have warm lotion for after bath/shower.  </li>

      <li>Warms lotion nicely.</li>
      <li>Heats up lotion quickly &amp; feels great on the ski to put on warm lotion.  </li>
      <li>Heats quickly and works great.</li>
      <li>(that might just be because I use lotion more often when it&#x27;s nice and warm, or it might be because it&#x27;s easier to rub it in thoroughly when it&#x27;s warm and more</li>
      <li>Perfect for getting out of the shower and having nice, warm lotion to put on, especially here in the Northeast!</li>
      <li>worth every penny, great for after shower lotion application</li>
      <li>love it, warm lotion is a must</li>

      <li>nice on/off switch to turn off easily.  </li>
      <li>I plan to purchase a couple more.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I consider this one of the best inventions ever! It is fabulous to have warm lotion waiting when you get out of the shower - especially in the winter.</li>
    <li> do not work,  so I have to return</li>
    <li> There is something about putting on nice warm lotion after a shower. I love my lotion dispenser! I flip it on to warm up before I head into the shower then flip it off again when I get out.</li>
    <li> Had it for about two weeks, used it twice, and then it stopped working. The pump was no longer bringing anything back up. I took off lid, as if to fill it up, and some ball bearings fell out and I had no idea where they came out of. We bought a replacement, but wasn&#x27;t too happy about it.</li>
    <li> It makes the lotion warm but doesn&#x27;t keep it warm enough</li>
    <li> My clients absolutely love having their hand massage done with heated lotion!!!!</li>
    <li> This is so so amazing. I&#x27;ve bought at least 10 of them for coworkers, family and myself. The lotion warms in two minutes. It is perfect especially during the winter. Everyone loves it. I use it every day and I&#x27;ll never go back to using lotion without it. My skin stays moisturized longer and absorbs the lotion much better.</li>
    <li> This is really nice when it works.  Unfortunately, it does not last long at all.  I&#x27;m on the 3rd one right now which just broke within the last 2 months, and I&#x27;m only using it once/day.  The heat control didn&#x27;t work right on the 1st one where it heated the lotion to the liquid/burning point.  With 2nd and the 3rd ones, the pump just stopped pumping the lotion out.  Even though I like the idea a lot, I&#x27;m giving up on this particular item.</li>
    <li> Total luxury item, and I love it! My daughter used to scream when it was lotion time, she would cry it was too cold. This warmer is awesome, lotion is always warm and ready to go- it&#x27;s a nice treat!</li>
    <li> Perfect for getting out of the shower and having nice, warm lotion to put on, especially here in the Northeast!</li>
    <li> The warmer works but there is a design flaw.  There is a toggle switch to turn the unit on, however it is placed on the cord at the plug, it should be next to the unit so that it can be plugged in anywhere.</li>
    <li> Heats to a great temperature and it very quick to heat up.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this thing.  She hates cold, and always gets the chills stepping out after a hot shower.  She fills it with Skin Milk lotion and it&#x27;s been working fine for three months now.</li>
    <li> Great item. Works exactly as I hoped. We use it everyday after our shower for lotion.</li>
    <li> Just imagine coming out of the bath or shower and having WARM cream&lt;br /&gt;to rub all over -- Well I love this item sooo much you simply turn the&lt;br /&gt;button when getting in and the light comes on telling you its ready you will love it</li>
    <li> Like the idea but does get warm and stay warm</li>
    <li> I actually love this little machine.  But the other reviewers are correct.  There is, sometimes, this little buzzing noise that is annoying.  But I&#x27;m still giving it 5 stars because it heats up the lotion just perfectly ... and well, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish that the company could figure out how to make that buzzing noise to stop.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> can not control how hot the lotion gets</li>
    <li> Every massage therapist should have one...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 2 months and love it. Unfortunately I dropped it and it broke, but I&#x27;m buying another one.</li>
    <li> As guilty as I felt about ordering something such as this, I am pleased with the resulting warm lotion.  Why should babies have all the sensitive treatment?  Who likes cold lotion after coming out of a hot shower?  Seriously.  I still think it&#x27;s a frivolous thing but am living with the guilt and I sleep well at night.</li>
    <li> love it, warm lotion is a must</li>
    <li> love it-never cold lotion again</li>
    <li> We now have two of these units - one is kept in the bathroom on the vanity where it warms the Dollar Shave Club shaving lotion, awesome stuff only made better by being dispensed WARM. The other is for hand lotion - wish I would have found these years ago.</li>
    <li> Everyone should have one of these.</li>
    <li> Love it. Use it every day.</li>
    <li> what is better than warm lotion!</li>
    <li> Love this dispenser!  Nothing like warm lotion on a cold day!</li>
    <li> I love this thing.  I bought this one so I&#x27;d have a duplicate to take with us when we travel in our motor home.  I&#x27;ve bought several of these as gifts for friends &amp; they all really like it.  It&#x27;s so nice to have warm lotion for after bath/shower.  Almost like being at a spa.</li>
    <li> Body lotion has never felt so good!!  No more shivering due to cold lotion- just delicious warmth!!  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Warms lotion nicely. I am a massage therapist and can start with warm lotion, add whatever essential oils I need or herbal balms in a separate small container, and I have a happy client</li>
    <li> My mother uses it everyday</li>
    <li> This performed just as I had hoped. Just fill it, plug it in, and turn it on before you step into your shower/bath.  It warms up in 2 minutes and ready to slather a nice and warm lotion on during cold and chilly days. The price was right and it&#x27;s working reliably.</li>
    <li> Works as described. Love having warmed lotion as I now need to put lotion after shower due to skin condition.</li>
    <li> love this.. especially on cool mornings or when I get done working out!</li>
    <li> Love it so far - a wonderful way of ending the day. Happy with it now and will keep you informed!</li>
    <li> Perfect...heats lotion in 90 seconds...very comfortable for a sick person. Will never use room temperature lotion again.  Wish it turned off automatically with a specified time frame or signaled that it is still &amp;#34;on.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The cost for this unit is 1/4-1/5 that of others...adding to the pluses of this product.</li>
    <li> We bought this to warm lotion for our newborn baby. After getting out of the warm bath, he&#x27;d cry at the touch of cold lotion. This warmer has worked wonders! It warms only a portion of the lotion at a time so it doesn&#x27;t dry out everything in the container. My baby loves lotion time now!</li>
    <li> This is a good product, but it has a major design flaw.  The directions tell you to turn it on, let the lotion warm up, then turn it off.  It has an on/off dial switch that you roll with your thumb, but the problem is that this switch is not located up by the warmer as would make sense, but it is right next to the plug.  If the plug is inaccessible (ie. you have it behind furniture or something), so is the on/off switch.</li>
    <li> Heats very quickly. If I turn it on then give my 4 week old a bath it is ready to go by the time I am done, and her bath is a max 5 mins long as all I do is wash her hair and pour warm water over her. It is the perfect temperature, not too hot. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> I read several other reviews and was concerned the lotion heater wouldn&#x27;t last. So far so good. I don&#x27;t have any issues with noise; it doesn&#x27;t make any.&lt;br /&gt;I am considering ordering another one for our second bathroom!  Heated lotion after a shower is awesome!</li>
    <li> As I have gotten older, my skin, has gotten drier. but I did not use the lotions much, because it was cold to put on. Now I put the lotion in, and within 2 minutes, its nice and warm. it really makes a difference and I do use the product almost daily.</li>
    <li> Heats quickly and maintains an even heat through all the lotion. I really like  . I had a more expensive model but it only heated a few pumps then you had to wait,,this is much better.</li>
    <li> I looove thiss, so I purchased one for my stepdaughter&#x27;s birthday. She loves it too!</li>
    <li> I have 2 lotion dispensers,one in our RV and one at home.I couldn&#x27;t be without the wonderful relaxing feeling you get when you moisturize you body after showering .It is particularly nice when we travel in dry climates; I add some body oil to the lotion and my skin thanks me for it.I have used the dispenser for over 10 years,had to get a new one now and then and was heartbroken,when Conair discontinued it for a while.I immediately bought 2 more, for back - up or gifts when they brought it back.&lt;br /&gt;Believe me, you will be so happy when you get one,the best idea for skin treatment ever.</li>
    <li> This warmer works well, lotion is not too hot or too cool.  We just received and have used it 4 times, it has worked very well so far.  I can report back in 6 months but so far, so good!</li>
    <li> Have purchased this in the past and was so glad to be able to get another one.</li>
    <li> Indulgent but awesome.</li>
    <li> I love the heated lotion dispenser. it keeps the lotion warm</li>
    <li> I Love this. This warms up my lotion and feels great on tense or dry skin. I&#x27;ve bought several to give for gifts and just for me.</li>
    <li> IT IS TERRIBLE. iT DOES not HEAT THE CREAM VERY MUCH AND IT DRIPS SO YOU HAVE TO KEEP A DISH UNDER IT. I WOULD NOT RECCOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE, ESPECIALLY  AT THAT PRICE!</li>
    <li> Off-On switch is close to the plug-in rather than closer to the unit which is the point of use.  Unit heats quickly and operates smoothly.</li>
    <li> Warmer stopped working the day after I purchased it.  On and off switch is fickle and will only turn on after waiting for an hr +!</li>
    <li> I thought it was great...... Until it started smelling like burnt lotion. Then I thought it was terrible and threw the thing out. I was grossed out by the smell of my own legs!</li>
    <li> Despite not being plugged in the coconut oil I put in it would constantly leak, and the power switch (which is located in the dumbest place possible at the plug end of the cord) broke after two weeks. It&#x27;s cheap, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> It warms the lotion to a luke-warm temperature, which is fine, but I personally would like to have it a little warmer. In order to put the lid on, you have to push down on the top and twist it to lock it in place. I found this annoying because lotion was dispensed just putting on the lid. I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars. It does do enough that I&#x27;ll keep it until I can afford a high-quality one.</li>
    <li> Item came very quickly, works great.</li>
    <li> Works great!  The markings for &amp;#34;Lock&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Unlock&amp;#34; wear off, so I just put a sticker where the spots are so I can find where to fasten the top on.  But it&#x27;s been fantastic for my massage business.  My clients love the warm lotion - especially when my hands are cold!</li>
    <li> The power switch for unit is an inline rotary switch which is OK. They mounted the switch right next to the plug that goes into the electrical outlet--which in my way of thinking, does not make any sense at all. It has a six foot power cord on it to allow for the convenience of putting the unit where you need it but then to actuate it, you have to track the power cord to the wall outlet which may not be in the most convenient location!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why not locate the switch next to the unit? It would not be hard to make that change at the factory.</li>
    <li> Warm lotion on a cold morning, what better way to start your day. Love this lotion dispenser</li>
    <li> Great Dispenser, Nice Heated Lotion.</li>
    <li> The design has changed from the previous recent purchases. It has &#x27;NEW&#x27; electric feature (&#x27;zinc ear&#x27;) that produces unpleasant noise and creates complications during the operation, resulting in mishandling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy it again, unless the design is reverse to the previous (simple one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish this could be replaced with the old or get a refund!</li>
    <li> Heats enough for warmth. But the spout leaks for an  hour after use, creating mess. Couldnt find a way to stop that</li>
    <li> Wife loves warm lotion in the winter.</li>
    <li> This thing is great.  I have tried other lotion warming devices but this one works the best.  It&#x27;s basically a large pump bottle (just like a shampoo bottle) that heats up the lotion while its in the pump mechanism.  Because it doesn&#x27;t heat up the entire reservoir of lotion, it doesn&#x27;t waste time or energy.  You will notice that if you take 3-4 pumps of lotion out quickly it needs about 30 seconds to re-heat but generally you need about 30 seconds to apply a hand full of lotion anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side, the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; switch is a roller switch attached to the cord very close to the end of the plug.  It works like one of those old lamp switches with a plastic wheel the size of a nickel with ridges on the edge embedded in a small box.  I think they used this type of switch because you can work it even if your hands are covered in lotion.  It doesn&#x27;t really bother me because I usually just unplug it when I&#x27;m not using it, but I don&#x27;t see why they couldn&#x27;t have just used a switch on the main part of the device.  The only other negative is that the reservoir doesn&#x27;t lock onto the top part well.  It locks but doesn&#x27;t click in or stay really well, so it seems like it could come apart, even though this hasn&#x27;t happened to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite these few negatives, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it and I still think it works great.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I would give this item 5 starts if it had an auto shut off. Warms the lotions well enough but I have to remember to turn it off!</li>
    <li> After a very long, cold winter and getting out of the shower only to have to apply cold lotion I was pretty sure there had to be a better way.  This dispenser is awesome.  The heating element is in the spout, so you are not heating the entire container.  The lotion is spa warm in 90 seconds.  No cold lotion ever again.</li>
    <li> (Buzz) Does what (buzz) it says (buzz), dispenses warm (buzz) lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention it buzzes..... all (buzz) the time (buzz)....</li>
    <li> Not bad. Keep lotion warm. great for foot-rubs, especially in the cold parts of the country.&lt;br /&gt;Heater does become a bit noisy after time. Seems to be getting more and more pronounced. Not enough to knock down to 3 stars. Likely will buy again</li>
    <li> Everyone should own one of these dispenser. The lotion comes from the device so very, very warm. I love it. Great product!!!!</li>
    <li> bought for my granddaughter she loves it hates cold lotion</li>
    <li> worth every penny, great for after shower lotion application</li>
    <li> The worst thing about winter is how hard it is on our skin and everyone knows we have to use moisturizer on it to keep from itching to death. With one of the coldest winters in a long time, getting out of a warm shower only to put cold lotion on gave me the chills. Now putting warm lotion on makes me feel like I&#x27;m in a spa being pampered. This is one of the best items I&#x27;ve ever bought for myself.</li>
    <li> Buy this for your wife now! Rapid heating to comfortable warmth. If I got raves, you certainly will. Unit was well balanced with reasonable length cord.</li>
    <li> I like the product but gave it 3 stars for certain functions.  The lotion warms up quickly and the product is compact so it does not take up much room.  However the flaws I see are as such: 1) it makes a buzzing noise periodically as if there is an electrical issue which is concerning for fire safety, so I will contact the company regarding this. The instructions do not mention whether this noise it to be expected 2) I purchased this for my baby because she hates having cold lotion placed on her however, caution should be taken not to put the lotion directly on the baby&#x27;s skin from the dispenser as I noticed it can get a bit hot for the baby&#x27;s sensitive skin.  I always place the dispensed lotion on my hands first then the baby&#x27;s skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good features are: 1) warms up quickly  2) compact &amp; does not take up much space  3) nice on/off switch to turn off easily.  4) the warm lotion is soooo nice especially in the winter time</li>
    <li> Love it!!  I plan to purchase a couple more.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Bought this one for my daughter -in -law and she loves it.  I&#x27;ve had one for about 10 years and I love mine as well. Heats quickly and feels wonderful to put warm lotion on.</li>
    <li> Like it when it works. Had one that lasted a year. Another about a month. But when it works  fantastic.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a christmas present for my mother and she seems to really enjoy it.  It warms up quickly and it cools down quickly.  The only negative I would say would be that the on/off button is close to the end of the cord where it plugs into the outlet.  So it&#x27;s not like you can plug this in and sit it on your nightstand and just turn the switch off/on easily.  It would be just the same as unplugging it each day.  Little inconvenient that&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> Heats quickly and works great.</li>
    <li> Being pregnant and living in a cold climate, I felt like a genius when I came up with the idea of a lotion warmer when I was too cold to put chilly lotion on my belly one evening. A quick google search later, I was relieved to find someone else had already made such an invention a reality and I could buy in on Amazon prime in the wee hours of the night! But, this purchase was a much bigger pain then anything. The thing simply DID NOT WORK. I tried everything, read and re read directions, different lotions, pumped it a hundred times. NADA. I had to return it. BUMMER.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  Very helpful for applying warm lotion during these dry winter days.</li>
    <li> Love it, gets the lotion really warm but not too hot. Really nice!</li>
    <li> very nice. Warm lotion in the winter time.Im glad I bought this item</li>
    <li> Great product. It really does warm your lotion and i love the fact that you have a switch to either turn it off or turn it on. What is great is that you could leave it plugged in, switched on and just leave it there. Don&#x27;t have to worry about the lotion burning or any of that sort. The only reason why i can&#x27;t give it a full 5 star is because the twisting (in order to fill the lotion in it) is not as smooth and i always feel like i could easily twist too hard and break the lid.</li>
    <li> Works great and heats up fast.</li>
    <li> This heats up the lotion quickly but I wish it got the lotion hotter.  I haven&#x27;t had the problem other reviewers have had with it leaking from the spout but I unplug it when I&#x27;m not using it</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion warmer for my newborn son because he is very sensitive to cold.  The on/off switch is right next to the plug, which makes no sense whatsoever.  I guess maybe it&#x27;s a safety thing??  It makes it so cumbersome and annoying to use.  Also, after not using it for a couple days, the lotion was dripping out of the dispenser.  I will say, though, that it made the lotion a nice temperature and it wasn&#x27;t too hot (or too cool) for my baby.  But it&#x27;s definitely not worth it.  I threw it out.</li>
    <li> Great product. Hear the lotion is a couple of minutes. I don&#x27;t like the switch is close to the plug. I also needs to be plugged and unplugged each time,  It&#x27;s worth it, It hold a lot of lotion and it&#x27;s easily dispensed.</li>
    <li> This is okay.  It does the job, but it seems to be overpriced at $25.</li>
    <li> its awesome! I love it!</li>
    <li> This heated lotion dispenser is fabulous.  I like it much better than the Conair one with the chrome trim which is a lot more money.  The lotion is easy to put in and it comes out silky and smooth - heats up FAST.</li>
    <li> This lotion warmer works great! It does not go off automatically like my old one did which is a little disappointing, but the lotion warms up much quicker than my old one.  It does give an odd little chirp when it&#x27;s on (sounds like a cricket) but I do not mind that so much as it is a reminder to unplug it when I&#x27;m finished.</li>
    <li> Love this. It makes my lotion very warm in only two minutes. I no longer have to sacrifice my skin because it is too cold in my bathroom. Putting on lotion is actually very enjoyable and relaxing now, instead of a miserable experience as it was when my lotion was freezing cold. Only thing is it &amp;#34;leaks&amp;#34; a bit. In other words, I will find that when I go in the bathroom in the morning that a tiny bit of lotion has leaked out the the dispenser, onto my counter tops overnight. Therefore, I would recommend keeping your dispenser on a paper towel just to save yourself any mess. Also, note that this is for thin lotion, the thicker the lotion, the more trouble you will have. Definitely for lotion only and nothing with a creamy consistency.</li>
    <li> I love getting out of a hot shower and using warm lotion on my skin. It feels so luxurious, I use it every time I shower. The only thing I&#x27;d change on it is the design of how to get the lid off to re-fill it. You have to push the lid down and turn. I guess they didn&#x27;t think of the remaining lotion that squirts out when you do this. Needs some additional thought on the design, but I still love it (even though I curse at it when re-filling it).</li>
    <li> It is kinda loud, has a buzzy sound. but I dont keep it turned on all day. it heats up quickly. I turn it on before I take a shower and then turn it off after I use it. I really do like having an nice warm lotion to apply to dry skin especially in the winter.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t you just hate it when you get out of a long hot shower and have to put on cold lotion?</li>
    <li> Does not work well, hard to pump lotion out and keeps loosing the suction.  I had another of this unit purchased elsewhere that we used for many years.  When it finally stopped working we purchased another.  This one is so frustrating to use.</li>
    <li> Maybe its defective .. once &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; and the light turns amber, in about 1 minute the lotion is nice and toasty warm and the light shuts OFF. At that point I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s on or off !! Then in about 2 minutes the light goes back on, I am guessing it&#x27;s re-heating because in about 30 seconds, the light goes off again and the lotion remains nice and warm. Maybe it&#x27;s broken or maybe it is supposed to do that. Without a true on/off light the only alternative is to unplug it. I have emailed Conair directly to get an answer from them before I pack it up and return it.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product, when it worked. After about 2 weeks it stopped pumping, you can clean it out and re-prime it and it gives you a few drops. Too late to return it.</li>
    <li> Works great - definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> Seems to stop working after about 6 month, but I love the warm lotion so much that i ordered a new one.</li>
    <li> My hubby &amp; I have had several back surgeries, so he wants a back rub almost every night. Cold lotion, SUCKS!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This has been a GODSEND. To have the lotion warmed before you put it on, WONDERFUL.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but when you add in the hand friction it consistently burns my penis.</li>
    <li> This item works beautifully. Heats the lotion in 2 minutes.</li>
    <li> This thing is terrible. Primed it, did everything I could, and it just gets jammed up so that nothing comes out. I use just a normal old Jergens lotion. was so frustrated, I threw the stupid thing in the trash so I wouldn&#x27;t have to look at it anymore. And now I see it in my list of things to review. Ugh.</li>
    <li> I was hoping it would be like the original Conair Heating Lotion Dispenser.  The design has some flaws. First, the only way to turn it off and on in a switch about two feet from where it is plugged in . Secondly, it buzzes an irritating noise every time it comes on the heat the lotion. It can be heard over soft music like a mosquito in your ear.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t buy a lot of beauty products.  However, my children were always complaining when I apply lotion after their bath.  We live in a dry climate and they need the lotion.  So when I found this product, I had to try it and I am very pleased.  It dispenses lotion at a nice, warm, relaxing temperature.  It warms up quickly.  When I put them into the bath I turn it on and it is ready when they get out.  We have very dry skin so I wish it could warm thicker lotion but otherwise this is perfect.  We do not have a buzzing sound as some reviewers mentioned.</li>
    <li> you can not use this product with oil, only with lotion.  wish the description would have said that.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 1 month now.  The on/off switch has broken off and the unit will not heat up.  I would like to get the unit replaced as I mentioned before that I bought the item in May 2015 and have only been using  it for about a month.</li>
    <li> It is great! Heats up lotion quickly &amp; feels great on the ski to put on warm lotion.  Will take thick lotion. Love it!!</li>
    <li> This is probably one of the best $20 I have ever spent on myself. I love lotion but in the winter and after a shower its just so so cold. This fixes that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion isn&#x27;t just lukewarn or room temperature it is soothingly warm.&lt;br /&gt;The container holds a lot of lotion so you aren&#x27;t constantly refilling.&lt;br /&gt;It heats up quickly and evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons.&lt;br /&gt;It would be better if the on/off switch was location on the warmer instead of right by the plug. It can be inconvient to reach the plug to turn this off. Hence why most on/off switches exist in the first place instead of just unplugging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filling it can be cumbersome. When your hands have lotion on them and you have to twist it into its lock position you only have the pump to use for moving it into place, which then constantly squirts lotion all over you as you are trying to lock it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall good buy and I have recommended it to friends already. I love a good lotion leg shave but usually shy away from it due to how cold it can be, not any more.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  It does beep which is ok.  It reminds me it is on so I just turn it off.  My son has eczema and hates to put lotion on.  But now with the warmer, he loves putting it on!  Great win win.</li>
    <li> It is supposed to turned off when not in use. The cord has a on/off switch which is located near the outlet not near the dispenser.Alot of reaching behind furniture to turn on and off. The on/off switch would have been more practical to be at arm&#x27;s reach when using dispenser.</li>
    <li> It doesnt heat fast enough...you have to press the express button 4 or 5 times before it&#x27;s warm ....by that time u- r gone</li>
    <li> Been using for over a month previous reviews said it dripped and they were correct but not so much you feel like you are wasting any.&lt;br /&gt;My self and my clients have really enjoyed this dispenser. Works great.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I only plug it in when we&#x27;re going to use it (shower time for me, bath time for the kids). It heats up very quickly and to the perfect temperature. I find that we&#x27;re going through a lot more moisturizer, but that&#x27;s because we&#x27;re actually all using it after every bath, like we should! I also  find it much easier to rub the lotion in, and I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in my skin on my legs (that might just be because I use lotion more often when it&#x27;s nice and warm, or it might be because it&#x27;s easier to rub it in thoroughly when it&#x27;s warm and more liquidy.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does make a bit of a weird noise on and off when it&#x27;s on, but I actually like that because it makes it much harder for me to accidentally leave it on. I find the amber &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; light a bit difficult  to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also very very easy to load lotion into - the whole top piece screws off easily, and the container is very wide, so you can easily pour your lotion in. The pump doesn&#x27;t drip, either, which is great!</li>
    <li> Great concept but it leaks, making it a pain in the arse contraption. Womp womp.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Now I don&#x27;t dread putting on lotion on those cold winter mornings!</li>
    <li> No problems yet, works as expected.</li>
    <li> Alittle big I need a lot of lotion to fill it but does work nicely only problem is I have no idea how this could get cleaned out.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement, after about ten years of use the old one gave out,</li>
    <li> Hears nicely, but the light doesn&#x27;t work (so I can never tell if it is on or not).</li>
    <li> Although the lotion dispenser warms the lotion very well it also makes a humming sound. This is kind of scary and makes me think that it will have an electrical problem. I was unable to return it because I threw away the box when I opened it</li>
    <li> This is a great device.  I now use skin lotion every day.</li>
